"'Joe the Plumber', the everyman used by John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign, has sparked outrage with an online comment piece claiming 'America needs a white, Republican president'. In an article posted to his website on Thursday, Joe Wurzelbacher assured readers that wanting a 'white Republican president doesn’t make you a racist, it just makes you American.' The controversial post contended that '[i]n the pre-black president era, criticizing the president was simply the American thing to do. An exercise of one’s First Amendment right. Criticism had nothing to do with color, because there had never been a black president.' Joe the Plumber: In an article posted to his website on Thursday, Joe Wurzelbacher assured readers that wanting a 'white Republican president doesn¿t make you a racist, it just makes you American' The eyebrow-raising opinion piece questioned why nobody accused black people of racism 'when blacks had sanity and disagreed with the policies of racist white Democrat presidents.' The conservative activist also brought Mexicans into his argument, saying 'many deranged Mexicans' who fight for immigration rights 'are not called racist.' The scathing post has triggered a social media backlash, with users accusing Republican party member Wurzelbacher of racism. The Daily Edge wrote: '#ThatAwkwardMoment when racist Joe the racist Plumber says wanting racist things doesn't make him a racist #racism'. John wrote: 'A white President killed 100.000's in Iraq. A black President gives healthcare to kids with cancer. Joe the Plumber wants the white one. #p2' Joe the Plumber uploaded the controversial remarks to his JoeforAmerica.com website on Thursday . Fight back: Joe Wurzelbacher defended his post on Facebook, saying he merely reproduced the comment piece of a 'black guy' Defensive: Wurzelbacher said he did not author the controversial piece. He said he copied the post, written by Kevin Jackson (pictured), verbatim to his site from theblacksphere.net. However Wurzelbacher has hit back, saying he did not author the piece but merely copied an article written Kevin Jackson and posted to theblacksphere.net on October 9. According to his profile, Jackson 'believes that empowerment comes when you know who you are and what you stand for.' On Saturday night, Wurzelbacher, 39, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Let no chance to find a boogey man in a non-racist's closet go by without first taking time to blame a white guy for repeating something a black guy said...about a black guy.' Joe the Plumber gained national prominence when he asked then presidential candidate, Barack Obama, a question about his tax plan in 2008. Obama's response included the statement, 'when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.' Obama's response was seized upon by conservative media, as well as by Obama's rival, Republican nominee Senator John McCain, as an indication that Obama was interested in the redistribution of wealth, and had a socialist view of the economy.","Joe Wurzelbacher, the everyman used by John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign, has caused outrage with a new post on his 'Joe for America' website .

"President Obama is expected to outline a seismic shift during Tuesday's annual State of the Union address in how much tax American businesses pay, but the devil is in the details. While his plan will lower the top corporate rate, smaller companies whose proceeds are considered individual income – since they're not organized as large corporations – won't see any benefit. And the net impact, says one Washington, D.C. watchdog group, will be more money, not less, flowing into the federal government's coffers. Those funds, the group says, will be redistributed into public works projects calculated to benefit labor unions that support Obama and other Democrats. Obama hinted at a corporate tax overhaul proposal in his 2013 State of the Union speech, never bringing anything forward until 2014 when a congressional election looms large . Corporate giants like Google would pay more taxes under Obama's plan when it kills deductions and closes loopholes, but the big companies would get a rate reduction in exchange -- unlike smaller businesses . Manufacturers love infrastructure projects near their factories, a fact Obama is hoping to leverage in order to get the GOP to go along with his plan: some of the new tax revenue would reportedly pay union-backed construction projects across America . Problem for Obama: The U.S. has no rivals in the corporate-tax department among developed nations, according to data collected by the Tax Foundation . 'The President’s plan is a net tax increase,' the right-leaning anti-tax group Americans . for Tax Reform said Monday. 'The plan raises taxes on all American . employers, but only gives partial rate relief to the largest . multi-national companies.' Obama . will reportedly dust off a proposal Tuesday night from his 2012 . campaign, when he argued for lowering the top corporate tax rate from . 39.1 per cent to 28 per cent in exchange for closing a series of tax . loopholes and disallowing a wide range of business tax deductions. Those give-backs . Obama would affect all businesses, both small and large, while only the . largest corporations would see a reduction in their overall rates. The average top corporate tax rate among member nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is 25 per cent, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation. America's top rate is the highest. And 'cutting the corporate rate to 28 percent will only help very large companies,' ATR says, since most companies in America file and pay taxes using the individual tax rates.' IRS data show that 32 million businesses file tax returns every year, and fewer than 2 million of them are corporations that can tax advantage of tax rates and loopholes extended to General Motors, Apple Computer, ExxonMobil and other Wall Street titans. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that a source who received a private White House briefing advised the paper to 'expect to hear Mr. Obama trumpet a proposal he made last year: reworking the business-tax system and directing proceeds to roads, bridges and other public works projects.' ATR sees those initiatives as Democrat-aligned union construction projects. Grover Norquist, the group's president, was aghast. Oh, poop: Dog-walkers and other small businessmen and women will continue to pay individual income tax rates on everything they earn, but they'll have to give up the same deductions the big boys are slated to lose . Run your own consultancy from your kitchen table? You're out of luck, too -- stuck with a 44 per cent effective tax rate . Playing coy: A milquetoasty White House press secretary Jay Carney will say only that Obama will address 'the need to grow our economy in a way that rewards hard work and responsibility, that makes the middle class more secure' That kiss Obama blew to his wife before delivering last year's State of the Union address might be redirected this year to congressional Democrats who need political cover to push his 'income inequality' philosophy on the campaign trail . 'Again?' he asked when MailOnline contacted him in Washington. 'Obama is . spraying perfume on and recycling two ideas that have already failed.' 'One, . ""tax reform"" – by which he means higher overall taxes on businesses . targeting entrepreneurs and the self-employed – and two, taking all that . tax revenue and having another stimulus spending spree.' 'It failed the last time,' said an exasperated Norquist. 'How stupid does he think we are?' In his 2013 address, Obama promised several initiatives that never managed to arrive later in the year amid scandals that included Obamacare's sputtering start, an alleged Benghazi cover-up, The National Security Agency's data collection programs, the IRS's targeting of tea party groups and the Justice Department's spying on journalists. Harping a year ago on the so-called 'Buffett rule,' Obama told Congress that Americans deserved a 'tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries ... and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.' A year later, the White House is gearing up to take some action. But ATR warned Monday that the net result would be a higher tax bill overall. 'The Republican House would never support a net tax increase, and using the money to fund Big Labor (and, by extension, Democrat campaign coffers) is hardly a sweetener,' the group said in a statement. Obama is emboldened by the populist appeal of his 'income inequality' argument, a Democratic Party insider told MailOnline. And he hopes to soften Republicans for a minimum-wage hike by offering big business a carrot instead of a stick. 'The president is now preparing speeches on income inequality,' said RNC chair Reince Priebus, but 'I believe he should give those speeches while standing in front of the mirror, because under his watch, everything has gotten worse' But the result may be a triple-whammy on employers if they find themselves squeezed simultaneously by a higher tax bill, higher wage costs and higher health care expenses. Still, congressional Democrats desperately need a defining issue to run on in the November midterm elections, and the White House believes a rich-vs-poor argument can win the day with its base. And anything that sniffs of a tax cut for the rich, suggests Democratic Rep. Steve Israel, won't play well with liberal voters. Israel chairs the Democratic Party's congressional campaign organization. 'Middle-class security is the defining issue of our time,' Israel told the Associated Press. 'Our candidates are going to talk about what priority makes more sense for the middle class: Increasing the minimum wage, or decreasing taxes for the wealthiest? Those contrasts are imperative and revealing.' The danger for Democrats is that the current state of play for lower-income Americans has followed five years of Obama's presidency. Republican National Committee Chairman . Reince Priebus told a partisan crowd last week that Obama was trying to fix a problem that he caused himself. 'The president is . now preparing speeches on income inequality. I believe he should give . those speeches while standing in front of the mirror, because under his . watch, everything has gotten worse,' Priebus told the GOP's winter meeting in Washington, D.C. 'His economic policies are not working,' Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz added Sunday on the CBS program 'Face The Nation.' Americans for Tax Reform president Grover Norquist, an anti-tax crusader whose pedigree dates from the Reagan years, asked Obama supporters: 'How stupid does he think we are?' Yes, you too: most U.S. farmers are sole proprietors of their businesses, making them ineligible for what may appear to be a massive Obama tax rate cut . While many small U.S. businesses cope without any tax relief, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg will find his company's earnings taxed at a lower rate under Obama's expected proposal . After-tax U.S. corporate profits are at a level not seen since the years following World War II. And it has been 60 years since ordinary workers saw a smaller share of the nation's economic output than they did in 2013. The campaign manager for a Republican House candidate in New York, Israel's home state, told MailOnline on background that Obama's foray into tax policy could blow up in his face. 'The president needs more Democrats in Congress, and he's not going to get there by offering what looks like a tax cut for Wall Street,' the political operative said, 'even if the result is shareholders getting smaller dividends and CEOs losing some of their bonuses.' 'It's the perception that counts in November, and it sounds like Obama is going to have to go back to his people and whisper, ""Don't worry about that corporate tax cut – I don't really mean it.""' The White House has been mum on the content of Obama's speech. Jay Carney, his press secretary, told Reporters on Friday only that the president would address 'the need to grow our economy in a way that rewards hard work and responsibility, that makes the middle class more secure.'","Watchdog warns: Obama will head-fake by offering tax cuts to big businesses while closing loopholes on every company in America .

"Arrested: Yonathan Melaku, a Lance Corporal Marine corps reservist who lives in Virginia and is Muslim, is being investigated for suspicious behavior . Yonathan Melaku, a Lance Corporal Marine Corps reservist who lives in Alexandria, Virginia and is Muslim, has been identified as the suspect arrested less than a mile from the Pentagon. Mr Melaku, 22, was taken into custody early Friday under suspicion that he posed a potential terrorist threat to the Pentagon, a highly sensitive site in the post-9/11 world. At first, media reported police 'found ammonium nitrate, ammunition and al Qaeda literature' in his car, which was parked in bushes near the Pentagon. Later, FBI Special Agent Brenda Heck told reporters: No explosives were found in the vehicle, a red 2007 Nissan. A backpack the detained man was carrying held bags labelled 'ammonium nitrate' and filled with five pounds of material. But upon investigation, it turned out to be 'non-explosive unknown material', according to Ms Heck. Ms Heck would not confirm earlier reports that he was carrying a notebook that included phrases related to Al Qaeda. U.S. Park Police spokesman Sgt. David . Schlosser said the man was in nearby Arlington National Cemetery . overnight, when it is closed, triggering an investigation. In the course of interviewing the man, police were directed to a car, he said. Mr Schlosser said: 'This is an unfolding situation'. He added that the proximity of the car to the Pentagon made the situation more suspicious. The building was not been evacuated, though roads in the area were closed this morning as a precaution and to ease the investigation. A red Nissan said to belong to the suspect is towed off of Washington Boulevard outside the Pentagon . Patrol: F-15 jets fly over Arlington, Virginia near the Pentagon, Friday, June 17, 2011, following a bomb scare just outside the nation's capitol . Police work : Officials monitor the situation near the Pentagon, where suspicious activity was discovered early June 17 in Arlington, Virginia . Scene: Law enforcement work near the Pentagon after a suspicious vehicle forced multiple road closures Friday, June 17, 2011 in Arlington, Virginia . Under threat? Shown from Air Force One in February 2009, the Pentagon is the site of an ongoing investigation into possible terrorist activity . Since the start of the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military has worked hard to recruit more Muslims, in order to make a more diverse and culturally aware fighting force. However, the military has also wrestled with concerns over the potential for extremist views, especially in the wake of a few high-profile incidents. Military personnel are not asked to disclose their religion. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the accused gunman of the Fort Hood shootings of November 2009, had not listed a religion on his official forms. The alleged gunman reportedly shouted 'Allahu Akbar!' (God is greatest) and opened fire on soldiers at the fort in Texas, killing 13 people and wounding 30. In April 2003, Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, a convert to Islam, rolled a grenade into a tent filled with soldiers, killing two and wounding 14 others. Sgt. Akbar, who was sentenced to death, said he feared the U.S. military would kill Muslim civilians during the war. Although Muslim soldiers can often get substantial signing bonuses, especially if they possess language skills or cultural knowledge likely to be useful abroad, many do adopt non-Muslim names out of fear of reprisal by extremists. The army hired its first Muslim chaplain in 1994 and builts its first permanent mosque, the Masjid al Da'Wah facility at Virginia's Norfolk Navy Base, in 1998. Pentagon police spokesman Chris Layman said the car was in bushes near the Pentagon's north parking lot. Mr Layman at first said one or two other people may have been involved, but the latest reports suggest that may be unlikely. Ms heck said, 'There was not a device'. She added that authorities believe the man acted alone, and is in his mid-20s. This morning, police were investigating a suspicious package in the vehicle, said a U.S. official familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way. Early reports had said police believed he was carrying ammonium nitrate - which can be used in bombs - and spent ammunition for . an automatic weapon. Mr Melaku is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia, according to reports. He reportedly joined the Marines as a reservist in 2007 or 2008, but military officials say he never deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. According to the Leesburg Police Department, Mr Melaku was arrested last month for breaking into 27 cars at around 3:30 a.m. on May 26 in Leesburg, Virginia. He is said to be facing charges related to that alleged incident. Authorities said Mr Melaku does not appear to have known ties to any terror organization. According to ABC, public records list Mr Melaku as living with relatives in a nearly . half-million dollar home in a small private community in Alexandria. Brenda Heck, Special Agent in Charge of the Counter Terrorism division of the FBI's Washington Field Office, center, speaks at a news conference about the alleged terror threat . Members of the Pentagon Police gather on an on-ramp to South Washington Boulevard outside the Pentagon . Officials say one man is under arrest after they found his car, parked in the bushes near the Pentagon, contained material that appears to be ammonium nitrate, ammunition and 'al Qaeda' literature . Police say they are still searching the area for one or two other persons of interest, who may be involved . Investigation: Law enforcement has closed roads near the Pentagon and is searching the area for suspected devices or persons of interest . Neutralized: Police say suspicious material in a suspect's car near the Pentagon has been 'neutralized' According to law enforcement sources, the man is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Initially he was thought to be of Ethiopian ethnicity. Early reports said police said they found a notebook that contained mostly notes for a . financial class, but also a page containing words 'al qaeda, 'Taliban rules', 'mujahidin  and 'defeated coalition forces'. The man allegedly told police that there were other 'devices' in the area and also the location of a vehicle. In another incident earlier this week, a motorist found with a gun and what appeared to be a suspicious package near the Pentagon was taken into custody. No charges have yet been filed against the detained man. According to Mr Schlosser, the detained man 'wasn't forthcoming' about who he was or what he was doing in . the cemetery after midnight.","Yonathan Melaku arrested less than mile from Pentagon after being in Arlington National Cemetery overnight .

"Of all the tales about the Loch Ness Monster, it must be one of the most unlikely – an English plot to kidnap the beast and display its carcass in London. But back in the 1930s the Scots feared that such a thing was all too possible, according to newly revealed papers, and fought to ensure she stayed north of the border. The Scottish Office opened a file on Nessie in December 1933 after being bombarded with inquiries following sightings that year. Scroll down for video . Sighting? This photograph, purportedly of the Loch Ness Monster was taken in 1934, a year after the Scottish Office opened a file on the creature after being bombarded with inquiries . And similar files have also been found at the Natural History Museum in London, with the contents describing Scotland’s fears that Nessie ‘should not be allowed to find its last resting place in England’ after a bounty was placed on the monster’s head. The documents also reveal that many years later Prince Philip even suggested calling in the Royal Navy to search for the creature. By 1934 both the Natural History Museum in London and the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh wanted Nessie. Strange spectacle: A report in the Inverness Courier from May 1933 noted there had been a 'strange spectacle' on the famous Loch and mentions the monster . Hunted: Scotland hoped to keep hunters, such as Marmaduke Wetherell, pictured searching for the monster in 1933, at bay until a law could be brought in to protect the creature . But while Scotland hoped that the bounty hunters could be kept at bay long enough to get new laws passed to protect her, London preferred her shot on sight. In March 1934 an unnamed official at the National History Museum made no bones about how he thought bounty hunters should deal with the creature. The files show he said: ‘Should you ever come within range of the “monster” I hope you will not be deterred by any humanitarian considerations from shooting him on the spot and sending the carcass to us in cold storage, carriage forward. Short of this, a flipper, a jaw or a tooth would be very welcome.’ Royal suggestion: The documents also reveal that many years later Prince Philip even suggested calling in the Royal Navy to search for the creature . Wanted: In March 1934 an official at the Natural History Museum in London said bounty hunters should shoot the monster on the spot and send 'the carcass to us in cold storage, carriage forward' According to more documents found in Edinburgh, pressure was already growing for a special Act of Parliament to prevent Nessie being killed or captured. The campaign was led by Inverness MP Murdoch MacDonald, who assured the Scottish Secretary Sir Godfrey Collins the creature was no myth. ‘Evidence of its presence can be taken as undoubted. Far too many people have seen something abnormal to question its existence,’ he wrote. He demanded a Bill be put before Parliament to protect the creature, but Sir Godfrey advised there was ‘no law for the protection of monsters’. The Royal Scottish Museum wrote to Sir Godfrey staking Edinburgh’s claim to the carcass. ‘The museum urges strongly that the RSM have the reversionary rights to the “monster” if and when its corpse should become available,’ the letter said. Protection: The campaign to protect Nessie was led by Inverness MP Murdoch MacDonald (left), who assured the Scottish Secretary Sir Godfrey Collins (right) that the creature was no myth . ‘We think the monster should not be allowed to find its last resting place in England. Such a fate would surely outrage Scottish nationalism which at the moment is thriving greatly under the monster’s beneficent influence.’ Natural History Museum files from the 1960s also state that when approached by a Tory MP, David James, who was ‘obsessed’ with Nessie, Prince Philip encouraged him to contact the Royal Navy for assistance. The revelations are made by author David Clarke in his book Britain’s X-traordinary Files. He said: ‘During the 1930s … Nessie had become a Scottish icon, a symbol of national identity. There was genuine outrage at the possibility that the corpse of the monster might be taken for display in London.’","The Scottish Office opened a file on Nessie in December 1933 .

"An Afghan man employed by the U.S. government opened fire inside a CIA office in Kabul, killing an American and injuring a second. In the second major breach of embassy security in Kabul, Afghanistan, in two weeks, the attacker was himself shot dead and the injured U.S. citizen was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. It was unclear if the U.S. citizens were victims of a rogue employee acting for insurgents or the escalation of an argument between the three. Security breach: A U.S. citizen was killed and another injured after an Afghan employee in a CIA office in Kabul opened fire last night . U.S. embassy spokesman Gavin Sundwall said: 'There was a shooting incident at an annex of the U.S. embassy in Kabul last night involving an Afghan employee who was killed. 'The motivation for the attack is still under investigation at this time.' He added that the Afghan employee was not authorised to carry a weapon and it was unknown how he had been able to get a gun into the secured compound. The shooting happened at the Ariana hotel, just a few blocks away from the Presidential Palace and the U.S. embassy, and used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a Kabul base. Kabul police chief Ayub Salangi said there had been an exchange of fire at the hotel, which he described as an 'office' for the CIA. High alert: Afghan policemen fire at a building taken over by insurgents in Kabul earlier this month. The U.S. government blamed the Haqqani network for the attack, which saw rockets fired at the U.S. embassy . The hotel has been closed off and heavily guarded since the fall of the Taliban government in late 2001. Perhaps because of its proximity to the Presidential Palace, it was used by ruling regimes for years before that. The attack comes in the same month insurgents took over an unfinished high-rise building near the city's heavily guarded military, political and diplomatic heart and showered rockets down on the U.S. embassy and NATO headquarters. That attack lasted 20 hours, and the U.S. has blamed it on the Haqqani network of militants, who were long based in Pakistan's lawless frontier regions. Washington accused Pakistan's spy service the ISI of offering them support. But senior Pakistani officials have hit back at the allegations, accusing the U.S. of trying to make Pakistan a scapegoat for its troubled war in Afghanistan. The U.S. has given Pakistan billions of dollars in military and economic aid, but the relationship has been riven by mistrust.","Fatal attack is second breach of embassy security in two weeks .

"A Vietnam War veteran and former Marine rifleman, it is fair to say U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Don Nicholas has served his country well in his 59 years. In fact, despite his 60th birthday fast approaching, he remains on active duty in Afghanistan. And yet, his biggest fear isn't spending another year on the front lines. To the contrary - it's retirement. Nicholas, who will be ordered out of the battlefield this summer due to age restrictions, is fighting to re-enlist so that he can remain a soldier as long as he's physically and mentally able to fight.

Afghanistan - where he serves on the front lines today. Having served in three wars over 16 total years in service, the married father-of-two still feels a call to duty.

"Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has been pictured taking her children to school in a taxpayer-funded taxi, moments after smoking a cigarette. The 23-year-old from Leeds, who infamously had a £4,800 breast enlargement operation on the NHS, was pictured days after it emerged her council is spending £6,000 a year on the cab journeys. The pregnant mother-of-two and her children, aged six and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school every day in a journey which costs Leeds Council £30 a day. Scroll down for video . Getting in the car: Josie Cunningham (left) and her children, aged six and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school every day in a journey which costs Leeds Council £30 a day . She receives the free taxi journeys on health grounds, after claiming she is now so hated that she cannot use public transport without facing abuse - and the stress was giving her anxiety attacks. The photographs also showed her holding a cigarette before getting into the car, after it was revealed she is smoking 20 cigarettes a day and will only quit if the taxpayer helps her kick the habit. Smoking: The photographs also showed her holding a cigarette before getting into the car . Yesterday, Miss Cunningham clashed with Loose Women co-host Myleene Klass who suggested it was wrong that NHS money was used to fund her £4,800 cosmetic surgery. She insisted: 'It has been used in the wrong places, but not with me', and told a shocked ITV audience that she wanted to be an 'inspiration to young women with 0 per cent breast tissue'. Before her appearance - which caused a stir on Facebook and Twitter - she tweeted a photo of herself in the changing rooms with the message: 'Not long till I'm on Loose Women... Haters are going to hate regardless.' The talk show’s presenters began the interview by saying that it was an opportunity to 'explain her side' after continuous negative publicity. Miss Cunningham said: 'You expect a bias opinion when you put yourself out there in the media. I won't say I disagree with everything they say. I did the first story so I can be an inspiration for young women or women of any age that are suffering from 0 per cent breast tissue. 'I have received a lot of abuse online and have just been bullied all my life for having no boobs. I am not going to be bullied again.' She added that her GP never offered her counselling, instead opting for the operation. Miss Cunningham also used her appearance to defend her use of taxpayer-funded taxis. The journeys, which cost Leeds Council £30 a day, would cost around £30 a week by bus, but Miss Cunningham insisted it was worth it, and said taxpayers should be grateful it was taxis rather than more expensive private hire cars. This year Leeds City Council is having to make savings of £50million from its budget. Controversial: Josie Cunningham told the ITV Loose Women panel that she wanted to be an inspiration to women who have 0 per cent breast tissue after she had a £4,800 breast operation on the NHS .

Pout: Miss Cunningham pictured leaving the ITV . studios after appearing on Loose Women this morning where she clashed . with Myleene Klass on whether her boob operation should have been funded . by the taxpayer . She said: 'I have been suffering with anxiety for about the last year now. Initially I was fine with the bus,' she said. Miss Cunningham has reportedly called police after a Coronation Street star claimed she wanted to ‘smack’ her over the taxpayer-funded taxis row. Catherine Tyldesley (right), who plays barmaid Eva Price in the ITV soap, had said on Twitter: ‘If she ever gets on my bus, I’ll smack her myself. #disgrace.’ The 30-year-old actress has since deleted the tweet, but Miss Cunningham told The Sun: ‘She glorified an attack on a pregnant woman to over 200,000 people’. Miss Tyldesley’s spokesman insisted that the comment was a ‘figure of speech’, adding that she ‘doesn't condone violence’. Her fellow star Simon Gregson, who plays Steve McDonald, said on Twitter: ‘I wonder if the Government will pay for my transport [because] I don't want my moobs on a bus.’ ‘It . is more of a confrontation in front of the kids really. It's not on. Any mother would agree. I have never said that I can't go on a bus . because I am famous.' She . said passengers tended to direct their frustration at her, angry about . her breast operation. Klass then asked her: 'But can you understand that . kind of anger? Miss Cunningham replied: 'I fully understand that. But the hatred shouldn't necessarily be aimed towards myself. 'There is more that the NHS should be doing to help these people. People who are not getting the funding.' When . asked about plans to abort her baby, she said producers from Channel 5 . had approached her about appearing in the Big Brother house and asked to . meet at a hotel in Manchester. 'It was all looking promising. But then I informed them that I was pregnant and it went downhill from there,' she said. Miss .

"For decades Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles has been home to the largest display of human misery in the United States - but now the area is facing its greatest challenge - gentrification. Since the Fall of 2006, the Los Angeles Police Department has been steadily clearing Skid Row of vagrants and homeless by stepping up the search and arrest of the down-and-outs who line its street corners. And for the past 20-years, photographer Camilo José Vergara has been documenting the slow metamorphosis of the iconic neighborhood of LA as it evolves from hosting the lowest dregs to even welcoming a brand new Whole Foods store. Cleaning the streets: An officer with the LAPD arrests a man who has been found on the corner of a Skid Row avenue - as they begin a process which started in 2006 . 'I started documenting the area in 1995. Derelict people-- mostly African Americans and Latinos--numbering in the thousands, —are concentrated in Skid Row,' said Vergara to MailOnline. 'The missions came to the area first. The Fred Jordan Mission is over forty years old, and the Union Rescue Mission, now in a new building on San Julian Street, has been in the community for ninety years. Rounded up: A police officer with the LAPD surveys a disabled homeless man on the streets of Skid Row who is showing no signs of waking from his sleep . Cuffed: Another homeless individual who is living in a neat tent on a Skid Row sidewalk is arrested by police and presumably taken away from the gentrifying area . What's this? An officer with the LAPD searches a man who he has arrested on Skid Row and is questioning him about what he has found on him . 'Many of the hotels built long ago to accommodate travelers arriving by train became single room occupancy hotels providing cheap places to live. After the missions came the soup kitchens, health facilities, and methadone clinics.' From short-term workers and migrants feeling the hardships of the Great Depression, to servicemen shipping out during the Second World War and Vietnam, Skid Row has always had a transient nature. Its most recent inhabitants have been those who find they have nowhere else to turn as drug addicts and alcoholics come to its streets to try to fight their demons. 'However, in recent years Skid Row has been transformed,' said Vergara. 'In addition to the museums, corporate offices and government buildings, many old industrial and commercial buildings in the area are being transformed into lofts, galleries, restaurants and luxury hotels. As Los Angeles’ old downtown is transformed into a new city center, officials have necessarily declared that the old Skid Row and the new downtown cannot coexist.' I'm only sleeping: This woman has taken a nap ontop of her worldly possessions as she rests on a stretch of Skid Row in Los Angeles . Work to be done: City sanitation workers move in to clear up Skid Row after decades of neglect during which the area became a mecca for vagrants and homeless people who needed somewhere to stay . Passed out: This man seems to have laid himself out on the sidewalk of Skid Row in a rather slap-hazard fashion - which is presumably one of the reasons why the LAPD are trying to clean up the streets of the notorious area . Witness to what amounts to a virtual clearing of the streets by the LAPD, Vergara recounts how he was watched the tactics of police first hand. 'Over the years, I have witnessed many such incidents along Skid Row, but none impressed me more than the one I saw in May of 2007 when a police car arrived, siren blaring and its loudspeaker screaming 'Wake up!, Wake up!' 'Startled—and thinking a violent crime must have occurred—I saw a policeman standing over a sleeping figure on the sidewalk at South 4th Street. It was nine o’clock in the morning and apparently the destitute person under the blanket had overslept.' Shoe and a home: This person has neatly laid out shoes to sell or that they own on the sidewalk of Skid Row - however, while this display is controlled - other's have not been so lucky and have been moved on by the LAPD . Community: Three men chat away the day in the afternoon Los Angeles sun on Skid Row as one of them animatedly makes his point . Sad and lonely: For decades Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles has been home to the largest display of human misery in the United States - but now the area is facing its greatest challenge - gentrification . Life goes on: Since the Fall of 2006, the Los Angeles Police Department has been steadily clearing Skid Row or vagrants and homeless by stepping up the search and arrest of the down-and-outs who line its street corners . 'Many of the hotels built long ago to accommodate travelers arriving by train became single room occupancy hotels providing cheap places to live. After the missions came the soup kitchens, health facilities, and methadone clinics.' Wit and art: From short-term workers and migrants feeling the hardships of the Great Depression, to servicemen shipping out during the Second World War and Vietnam, Skid Row has always had a transient nature . No hope: Its most recent inhabitants have been those who find they have nowhere else to turn as drug addicts and alcoholics come to its streets to try to fight their demons . Indeed, these people are homeless, and while a Whole Foods may be a symbol of downtown LA's gentrification, the former residents need somewhere to go. 'When I asked who was pushing the homeless out of Skid Row a woman explained 'the city, the police, the maintenance people,' said Vergara. 'I asked: Where are they going? She replied: 'They are going to jail. They are going under the bridges, by the LA River. They are going to the missions, but some don’t want to go there.' Feeling as if he is watching the end of Skid Row as we have known it, Vergara, who has published a new book entitled, Harlem, The Unmaking of a Ghetto, knows how impoverished neighborhoods can change. 'As the police gradually gain control over Skid Row, I feel I am witnessing its last days. In a decade or so Skid Row will perhaps become LA’s equivalent of New York’s Greenwich Village.'

"A 19-year-old student whose neck was impaled by a broken golf club is speaking out about the ordeal for the first time - and has revealed her plans to return to college. In a show of incredible resilience, Natalie Jo Eaton, from Harrisburg, Arkansas, is walking again five months after the freak accident on her second day of school at Arkansas State University. Speaking to Fox, she recalled how she was posing for a photo on August 19 when a  student behind her hit a football with his golf club, breaking the club and sending its shaft flying 30ft and into her neck. 'I thought someone had hit me in the head with a baseball bat,' Eaton told My Fox Atlanta. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Natalie Jo Eaton, 19, has given her first interview since she was impaled with a golf club in a freak accident at Arkansas State University in August. She remains at a rehab center in Atlanta, Georgia . Incredible: After five months of therapy, Eaton is now able to walk with the help of canes and staff members . She fell to the ground and tried to turn to see what had hit her - but as she looked, the metal in her back scraped across the concrete. 'That's when I knew there was something in my neck,' she recalled. The club had perforated her spinal cord and a major artery when it pierced her neck. As she lay on the ground, there was one thought in her mind. 'I just remember [thinking], ""If I'm going to die, please just let someone I know be here"",' she said. Fortunately her brother Brody, a recent medical school graduate, was nearby and kept her stable until emergency services arrived. She was airlifted to a Memphis hospital and three weeks later, she was transferred to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, one of the top rehabilitation hospitals for spinal cord injuries. Life-changing : Eaton was posing for the photograph when a male student behind her hit a football with a golf club, sending it hurtling towards her neck. Right, the student can be seen getting ready to swing the club . Battle: The club perforated her spinal cord and a major artery and she was airlifted to hospital for emergency sugery. Here she is pictured using a power wheelchair for the first time, three weeks after the accident . Doctors initially thought she would be paralyzed, but she started months of intense physical and occupational therapy, and soon learned how to sit and carry out everyday tasks, such as brushing and straightening her hair. At first, she said she was overwhelmed by the work but slowly, she began seeing improvements. She is now also able to walk with the help of a frame or canes while a staff member gives her support. 'When you start accomplishing little goals, you're like, ""Okay, there's a a light at the end of this tunnel. There's going to be a way that you can overcome this"",' she said. She continues to suffer from weakness on the right side of her body, but is hoping to leave the center by the end of January. After that, she hopes to start her freshman year again in August, and despite her struggles, she is remaining upbeat. 'You can look at it the bad way, as why did this happen to me?' she said. 'Or, you can look at it as I'm still alive. I'm still able to get better.' Back on her feet: Eaton, pictured walking left, reveals the large scar where she was struck in August .

E! Online then reported that the couple have gone their separate ways. According to a source they broke up about a week ago, and were last spotted together as long ago as October 20.

"Sid Caesar, the prodigiously talented pioneer of TV comedy who paired with Imogene Coca in sketches that became classics and who inspired a generation of famous writers, died early Wednesday. He was 91. Caesar died at his home in the Los Angeles area after a brief illness, family spokesman Eddy Friedfeld said. In his two most important shows, Your Show of Shows, 1950-54, and Caesar's Hour, 1954-57, Caesar displayed remarkable skill in pantomime, satire, mimicry, dialect and sketch comedy. And he gathered a stable of young writers who went on to worldwide fame in their own right - including Neil Simon and Woody Allen. Golden Age: Sid Caesar was one of the driving forces of what many television critis refer to as 'the Golden Age of comedy' 'The one great star that television created and who created television was Sid Caesar,' said critic Joel Siegel on the TV documentary Hail Sid Caesar! The Golden Age Of Comedy, which first aired in 2001. While best known for his TV shows, which have been revived on DVD in recent years, he also had success on Broadway and occasional film appearances, notably in It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. If the typical funnyman was tubby or short and scrawny, Caesar was tall and powerful, with a clown's loose limbs and rubbery face, and a trademark mole on his left cheek. But Caesar never went in for clowning or jokes. He wasn't interested. He insisted that the laughs come from the everyday. 'Real life is the true comedy,' he said in a 2001 interview with The Associated Press. 'Then everybody knows what you're talking about.' Caesar brought observational comedy to TV before the term, or such latter-day practitioners as Jerry Seinfeld, were even born. In one celebrated routine, Caesar impersonated a gumball machine; in another, a baby; in another, a ludicrously overemotional guest on a parody of This Is Your Life. He played an unsuspecting moviegoer getting caught between feuding lovers in a theater. He dined at a health food restaurant, where the first course was the bouquet in the vase on the table. He was interviewed as an avant-garde jazz musician who seemed happily high on something. The son of Jewish immigrants, Caesar was a wizard at spouting melting-pot gibberish that parodied German, Russian, French and other languages. His Professor was the epitome of goofy Germanic scholarship. Some compared him to Charlie Chaplin for his success at combining humor with touches of pathos. Legend: Two-time Emmy Award winner Sid Caesar died Wednesday at age 91 . 'As wild an idea as you get, it won't go over unless it has a believable basis to start off with,' he told The Associated Press in 1955. 'The viewers have to see you basically as a person first, and after that you can go on into left field.' Caesar performed with such talents as Howard Morris and Nanette Fabray, but his most celebrated collaborator was the brilliant Coca, his ""Your Show of Shows"" co-star. Coca and Caesar performed skits that satirized the everyday - marital spats, inane advertising, strangers meeting and speaking in clichés, a parody of the Western Shane in which the hero was Strange. They staged a water-logged spoof of the love scene in From Here to Eternity. The Hickenloopers husband-and-wife skits became a staple.'The chemistry was perfect, that's all,' Coca, who died in 2001, once said. 'We never went out together; we never see each other socially. But for years we worked together from 10 in the morning to 6 or 7 at night every day of the week. What made it work is that we found the same things funny.' Caesar worked closely with his writing staff as they found inspiration in silent movies, foreign films and the absurdities of `50s postwar prosperity. Your Show of Shows: Caesar's sketch comedy partner Coca (right) says the two worked well together because they 'found the same things funny' Among those who wrote for Caesar: Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart, Simon and his brother Danny Simon, and Allen, who was providing gags to Caesar and other entertainers while still in his teens. Carl Reiner, who wrote in addition to performing on the show, based his Dick Van Dyke Show - with its fictional TV writers and their temperamental star - on his experiences there. Simon's 1993 Laughter on the 23rd Floor' and the 1982 movie 'My Favorite Year' also were based on the Caesar show. A 1996 roundtable discussion among Caesar and his writers was turned into a public television special. Said Simon, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright: 'None of us who've gone on to do other things could have done them without going through this show.' 'This was playing for the Yankees; this was playing in Duke Ellington's band,' said Gelbart, the creator of TV's M-A-S-H and screenwriter of Tootsie, who died in 2009. Increasing ratings competition from Lawrence Welk's variety show put 'Caesar's Hour' off the air in 1957. In 1962, Caesar starred on Broadway in the musical Little Me, written by Simon, and was nominated for a Tony. He played seven different roles, from a comically perfect young man to a tyrannical movie director to a prince of an impoverished European kingdom. 'The fact that, night after night, they are also excruciatingly funny is a tribute to the astonishing talents of their portrayer,' Newsweek magazine wrote. 'In comedy, Caesar is still the best there is.' Pioneer: Caesar helped launch the careers of legendary comedians and TV writers like Mel Brooks and Larry Gelbart . His and Coca's classic TV work captured a new audience with the 1973 theatrical compilation film Ten From Your Show of Shows. He was one of the galaxy of stars who raced to find buried treasure in the 1963 comic epic 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, and in 1976 he put his pantomime skills to work in Brooks' Silent Movie.But he later looked back on those years as painful ones. He said he beat a severe, decades-long barbiturate and alcohol habit in 1978, when he was so low he considered suicide. 'I had to come to terms with myself. ""Yes or no? Do you want to live or die?'"" Deciding that he wanted to live, he recalled, was 'the first step on a long journey.' Caesar was born in 1922 in Yonkers, N.Y., the third son of an Austrian-born restaurant owner and his Russian-born wife. His first dream was to become a musician, and he played saxophone in bands in his teens. But as a youngster waiting tables at his father's luncheonette, he liked to observe as well as serve the diverse clientele, and recognize the humor happening before his eyes. Emmy: Caesar, seen here with Bob Hope (seated) and Milton Berle won two Emmy Awards over the course of his 60-year career . His talent for comedy was discovered when he was serving in the Coast Guard during World War II and got a part in a Coast Guard musical, Tars and Spars. He also appeared in the movie version. Wrote famed columnist Hedda Hopper: 'I hear the picture's good, with Sid Caesar a four-way threat. He writes, sings, dances and makes with the comedy.' That led to a few other film roles, nightclub engagements, and then his breakthrough hit, a 1948 Broadway revue called Make Mine Manhattan. His first TV comedy-variety show, 'The Admiral Broadway Revue,' premiered in February 1949. But it was off the air by June. Its fatal shortcoming: unimagined popularity. It was selling more Admiral television sets than the company could make, and Admiral, its exclusive sponsor, pulled out. But everyone was ready for Caesar's subsequent efforts. Your Show of Shows, which debuted in February 1950, and Caesar's Hour three years later reached as many as 60 million viewers weekly and earned its star $1 million annually at a time when $5, he later noted, bought a steak dinner for two. RIP: Caesar, whose wife of 67 years died in 2010, leaves behind three children . When Caesar's Hour left the air in 1957, Caesar was only 34. But the unforgiving cycle of weekly television had taken a toll: His reliance on booze and pills for sleep every night so he could wake up and create more comedy. It took decades for him to hit bottom. In 1977, he was onstage in Regina, Canada, doing Simon's 'The Last of the Red Hot Lovers when, suddenly, his mind went blank. He walked off stage, checked into a hospital and went cold turkey. Recovery had begun, with the help of wife Florence Caesar, who would be by his side for more than 60 years and helped him weather his demons. Those demons included remorse about the flared-out superstardom of his youth - and how the pressures nearly killed him. But over time he learned to view his life philosophically. 'You think just because something good happens, THEN something bad has got to happen? Not necessarily,' he said with a smile in 2003, pleased to share his hard-won wisdom: 'Two good things have happened in a row.'","Sid Caesar inspired dozens of legendary writers including Woody Allen and Neil Simon .

"A Texas appeals court on Thursday overturned a judge's ruling that had voided the marriage of a transgender widow whose firefighter husband died battling a blaze. The 13th Texas Court of Appeals sent the case of Nikki Araguz back to the lower court, saying 'there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding [Araguz's] sex and whether the marriage was a same sex marriage.' In 2011, state District Judge Randy Clapp in Wharton County ruled that the marriage between Nikki Araguz and her husband Thomas Araguz was 'void as a matter of law.' Victory: An appeals court has overturned a decision that voided Nikki Araguz's marriage to her first husband Thomas Delgado because she was born male . Thomas Araguz's mother and his first wife Heather Delgado had challenged the marriage's validity, arguing the fallen firefighter's estate should go to his two sons because Nikki Araguz was born a man and Texas does not recognize same-sex marriage. Attorneys for Delgado called the appeals court an 'activist court' relying on 'junk science' after the ruling. Nikki Araguz, 38, had argued in court she had done everything medically and legally possible to show she is female and was legally married under Texas law and that she's entitled to widow's benefits. 'It’s never been about the money for me.' Nicki said as she celebrated the court ruling with supporters Thursday night. 'If I would have stayed quiet, the only narrative anyone would have heard was that I was a trickin' tranny who lied to my husband.' Honest and loving: Nikki Araguz says her first husband was fully aware of transgender journey . Marriage: Nikki Araguz pictured with her first husband on their wedding day in 2008 . At a press conference Friday, attorney for Delgado Ted Burwell demurred. 'Whenever someone says it’s not about the money, you know what it’s about,' he said. The battle is over $635,000 in death benefits that the widow of a firefighter is entitled to. However, there is potentially millions more at stake. A lawsuit alleging a faulty light was responsible for the 2010 blaze which killed Thomas Araguz could result in millions in damages. Kent Rutter, Nikki Araguz's attorney, said his client was very pleased by Thursday's ruling. 'This decision recognizes that transgender Texans have the right to marry the person that they love,' he said. Araguz has remarried since her first husband's death. Second time around: Araguz has since remarried, to William Loyd . Attorneys for Simona Longoria, Thomas Araguz's mother, and Delgado, his ex-wife, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Longoria and her family have said Thomas Araguz learned of his wife's gender history just before his death and had planned to end the marriage. But Nikki Araguz, who remarried in 2013, has insisted Thomas Araguz fully supported her through the surgical process to become a woman. She underwent surgery two months after they were married in 2008. Thomas Araguz died July 2010 while fighting a fire at an egg farm near Wharton, located 60 miles southwest of Houston. He was 30. In its 26-page ruling, the three-judge panel of the Corpus Christi-based appeals court wrote that Clapp erred by essentially saying in his ruling that Nikki Araguz was a man at the time of her husband's death. Equal love: William Loyd (left) escorts fiancee Nikki Araguz and daughter Charlotte Loyd, nine, from Nueces County Courthouse Thursday, September 18, 2013 after Araguz's first hearing. The couple married outside the court minutes later . Marriage equality: Attorneys against Nikki Araguz described the appeals court as an 'activist court' relying on 'junk science' 'I fully expect the other side to fight back as hate mongers often do,' said Nikki Araguz said Thursday.Burwell said that hate was not an issue in the case. 'To construe that anyone is hate mongering is Nikki is just grandstanding,' said Burwell. Attorneys for Longoria and Delgado had argued Nikki Araguz was born with male sex organs and had such organs at the time of her marriage, making it invalid. Widow: Araguz stands to collect $635,000 in benefits and possibly millions more for the death of her firefighter husband . The appeals court said more expert testimony on this issue is needed as the only such testimony presented was an affidavit by one of Nikki Araguz's doctors, who wrote that she was medically and psychologically female as a result of her compliance with the standards of care adopted by the World Professional Association of Transgender Health. The three-judge panel also wrote that changes made in 2009 to the Texas Family Code that allowed transgendered people to use proof of their sex change to get a marriage license legislatively overruled a previous court decision that had been used as legal precedent in such cases. In that 1999 case, a San Antonio woman's wrongful-death claim brought on behalf of her husband was thrown out, with a court ruling that although the woman had undergone a sex-change operation, she was actually a man, based on her original birth certificate.","A Texas appeal court overturned a decision to void the marriage of Nikki Araguz and her late husband Thomas Araguz .

"To shoot oneself once is unfortunate, but to shoot oneself twice is simply careless: a sentiment that a police chief from Connersville, Indiana, would surely agree with. Police Chief David Counceller's 40-caliber Glock handgun accidentally discharged last Saturday while he was at Wulff's gun shop examining a handgun similar to the one he carries - he shot himself in the leg. Counceller, 60, who was off duty at the time, said: 'I need to pay more attention. I know what the dangers are. It was pure carelessness on my part.' Police Chief David Counceller, a 34-year veteran of law enforcement, has shot himself for a second time, calling it 'carelessness' Counceller shot himself when he was putting his gun into its holster, after he removed it to compare it side-to-side with a newer model. 'It got tangled in my clothing. I was wearing a sweatshirt and a fleece jacket,' he said. 'I felt the gun go in the holster and I pushed it, but it was tangled in the material which caused it to discharge. 'The bullet went into my leg and then into the floor.' Counceller drove himself to a Fayette Regional Health System for treatment of the wound, where nurses said they thought he was joking when he told them he'd shot himself. 'It is an entrance and exit wound. I'm really lucky. It doesn't even hurt. I'd have been at work on Monday if it wasn't Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but I'll be back at work on Tuesday.' Counceller's claims of luck might be up for debate, as it seems the self-inflicted gunshot wound is not his first. Fifteen years ago he accidentally shot himself in the hand. He said: 'I was working third shift as a captain. I was unloading the gun to take it to the gunsmith and I didn't drop the barrel to see if there was a bullet in the chamber. 'The shot hit my hand. That one really hurt.' Police Chief David Counceller has been called 'an excellent shot', despite having shot himself twice during his time as a policeman . Upon hearing Counceller had shot himself in the leg last Saturday, Mayor of Connersville Leonard Urban thought too he was joking when he got the call. He said: 'It was just a little accident. Dave is an excellent marksman. 'Apparently the Glocks don't have the trigger safety that they should have.' Counceller has been with the Connersville police department 33 years, starting his career in law enforcement as a military policeman in the 1970s. Compounding his embarrassment, the latest incident came in the middle of a run for the Republican nomination for Sheriff of Fayette County. But he said he sees the accident as an opportunity in his run ahead of May's primary. He said: 'If anyone says this could . never happen to them, they’re mistaken.' 'You have to . keep your guard up at all times. Some candidates are out there doing . things for kids to try to get elected. 'Me, I shoot myself. What a way to . get publicity.' A case of road rage on a highway in Orlando, Florida on Monday ended with a victim shooting himself in the leg. He had been traveling on the I-4 when another driver showed him a gun in what he described as a 'road rage incident'. Police officers in Orlando, Florida responded to a call of a shooting at the ramp at I-4 and Princeton Street at around 11:30am yesterday, and arrived to find the victim, Richard Coles, 36. Coles was taken to hospital and treated for non-life-threatening injuries.","Police chief is running for Fayette County Sheriff after 30 year career .

"The NSA has a children’s website filled with characters that give the agency a Saturday morning cartoon feel. Cryptokids comes replete with a buck-toothed rabbit, an Army fatigued-wearing bald eagle and a turtle wearing a backwards ball cap and sunglasses who thinks coding is ‘kewl.’ The site launched in 2005, but the New York Times brought into the broader consciousness Saturday after revelations made by former contractor Edward Snowden have cast an unfavorable light on the spy agency. Cryptokids: THe NSA's website targeted at the future spies of America . ‘In the world of diplomacy, knowing what your enemy is planning helps you to prepare,’ the turtle joyfully says. ‘But it is also important that your enemies do not know what you have planned.’ Children entering the site are treated to loading pages out of the late 1990s that say ‘decrypting information’ whenever clicking on different sections. Sections include ‘meet the gang,’ operation dit dah,’ ‘make your own secret codes,’ ‘battle of the badges’ and ‘how can I work for the NSA’ aimed at ‘future codemakers and codebreakers.’ ‘It is never too early to start thinking about what you want to do when you grow up,’ the site reminds youngsters. The cartoon characters all have biographies on the site possibly in an attempt to show all the different backgrounds today's spies have emerged from. Crypto Cat speaks Navajo after growing up next to a reservation, T. Top the turtle has an eight-year-old sister who annoys him ‘out of [his] shell’ and Sergeant Sam is an Eagle in the Central Security Service that ‘learned about duty, honor and integrity’ through serving in the military. Coding is 'kewl': The cartoon characters attempt to put a hip, young spin on spying . Diverse backgrounds: Each character has a unique upbringing that reflects the limitless boundaries of where the NSA has recruited agents in the past . The cadre of characters guides children through explanations of coding, ciphers, learning morse code and security officer bade identification, among others. It also tells children how to work for the spy agency. ‘As a signals analyst, you will work with cutting edge technology to recover, understand and derive intelligence from a variety of foreign signals found around the world,’ the site says. ‘You will also attempt to identify the purpose, content, and user of these signals to provide critical intelligence to our nation’s leaders.’ Targeting children is nothing new for the government, the Times notes, several other government agencies including the Department of the Treasury, the State Department and even the National Reconnaissance Office have similar sites. 'What are codes': The site teaches children about coding and breaking codes . Play time: Children are also invited to play games where the make and break codes, as well as use ciphers . America’s Army, released a decade ago, was a video game made by the Army as a recruitment tool at the beginning of the ‘war on terror.’ According to web ranking firm Alexa, the site’s main audience browses from school, is mostly male and predominantly from the U.S. ‘The internet is… great, but there are people out there who don’t have your best interests in mind,’ cybertwin Cy says. ‘Stop and think before sharing private information.’","The site launched in 2005, but has been refreshed multiple times since .

"Shirley Temple, America's little darling, has passed away peacefully at her home in California at the age of 85. The actress and singer died of natural causes at her home in Woodside, California, on Monday around 11pm, surrounded by her family and caregivers. 'We . salute her for a life of remarkable achievements as an actor, as a . diplomat, and most importantly as our beloved mother, grandmother, . great-grandmother, and adored wife for 55 years of the late and much . missed Charles Alden Black,' her family said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Farewell darling: Shirley Temple, pictured in movie Heidi in 1937, died on Monday night at the age of 85 at her home in California . Bright Eyes: The actress's face and voice are imprinted on generations as a result of her performance of the song On The Good Ship Lollipop . Shirley Temple, pictured in 1947 at the age of 19, became the youngest actor ever to win an Academy Juvenile Award in 1935 when she was six years old . The actress and singer, was born in the Californian beach town of Santa Monica on April 23, 1928, the third child of George Temple, afterwards a branch bank manager, and his wife Gertrude. Gertrude Temple had wanted to be a ballerina but had grown too tall - so channeled her thwarted ambitions into her daughter. Shirley Temple was just three years old when she was spotted by talent scouts at dance school and appeared on screen for the first time, in the one-reel short 'Poverty Row'. But it was the 1934 film Bright Eyes that made her famous. The actress's face and voice are . imprinted on generations around the world as a result of her performance . of the song On The Good Ship Lollipop. With her hair in ringlets, angelic face and wearing a checked . pinafore dress, the unforgettable rendition made her one of the . biggest box office draws of the era.

At the year's end she had entered the list of the world's top ten money-making stars at number eight. She became the youngest actor ever to win an Academy Juvenile Award in 1935, at the age of six. Her handprints were placed in cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood along with the biggest stars of the day. She was the world's number one box-office star from 1935 to 1938 - leaving Clark Gable trailing in second place. Her earnings were placed into a trust - during that time all she ever saw was $13 a month in allowance. Her mother, Gertrude, worked to keep her daughter from being . spoiled by fame and was a constant presence during filming. Her daughter . said years later that her mother had been furious when a director once . sent her off on an errand and then got the child to cry for a scene by . frightening her. 'She never again left me alone on a set,' she said. Temple went on to star in films such . as Curly Top and The Littlest Rebel, helping the U.S. cope with the . Great Depression of the 1930s. Temple became a nationwide sensation. Mothers dressed their little girls like her, and a line of dolls was launched that are now highly sought-after collectables. Her immense popularity prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to say that 'as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right'. 'When the spirit of the people is lower than at any other time during this Depression, it is a splendid thing that for just 15 cents, an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles,' Roosevelt said. She was credited with helping save the film . company 20th Century Fox, which owed $42million, from bankruptcy. In Britain, the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, were avid Temple fans. She even had a drink named after her, an appropriately sweet and innocent cocktail of ginger ale and grenadine, topped with a maraschino cherry. Her career faltered in 1939 . after Fox refused to loan her to MGM, she lost the lead in The Wizard of . Oz to Judy Garland. However she struggled to maintain her cinematic career in adulthood, though she continued to work in television.

John Agar, a sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Corps, in 1945 when she was just 17 years old. He is the father of her daughter Linda. The couple divorced four years later after the marriage disintegrated due to Agar's drinking and infidelity. On holiday in Honolulu in 1950 she met and fell in love with California businessman Charles Alden Black, nine years her senior, who confessed that he had never seen one of her films. They were married in December of that year and their son Charles Jr was born in 1952 and daughter Lori in 1954. They lived for many years in the San Francisco suburb of Woodside. The couple were married for 55 years until Charles passed away in August 2005 at the age of 86 from complications from a bone marrow disease. She described him as the 'love of her life' and kept his voice on the couple's answering machine. In 2006, when receiving a lifetime achievement award a few months after Charles had died, the veteran star said that her greatest roles were as wife, mother and grandmother. 'There's nothing like real love. Nothing,' she added. Star amongst stars: The actress appeared in the Bachelor Knight in 1947 with Grant again and Myrna Loy . Vibrant: Shirley pictured aged seven in Curly Top with actor John Boles . Winning formula: she was credited with helping save the film company 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy . Child stars Shirley Temple and Baby LeRoy pictured on a 'date' in 1934 . Although she had mostly retired from showbiz, by the early 1960s Temple's interest in politics soon brought her back into the spotlight. She made an unsuccessful bid as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967. After Richard Nixon became president in 1969, he appointed her as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. In the 1970s, she was U.S. ambassador to Ghana and later U.S. chief of protocol. She then served as ambassador to Czechoslovakia during the administration of the first President Bush. A few months after she arrived in Prague in mid-1989, communist rule was overthrown in Czechoslovakia as the Iron Curtain collapsed across Eastern Europe. A change of direction: Shirley Temple speaking on behalf of the Republican National Commitee in London in 1968 . 'My main job (initially) was human rights, trying to keep people like future President Vaclav Havel out of jail,' she said in a 1999 Associated Press interview. Within months, she was accompanying Havel, the former dissident playwright, when he came to Washington as his country's new president. She considered her background in entertainment an asset to her political career. 'Politicians are actors too, don't you think?' she once said. 'Usually if you like people and you're outgoing, not a shy little thing, you can do pretty well in politics.' Ms Temple Black was also a delegate to . several international commissions and was involved with the United . Nations. She was the first woman to serve as US chief of protocol in the . Department of State. Her public service saw her on the advisory . council and board of directors for numerous organisations involved with . anything from criminal justice to health charities or wildlife bodies. She also sat on the board of directors for the Bank Of California and . the Walt Disney Company. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranking of the top 50 screen legends placed Temple at No. 18 in a list of 25 actresses. Moving on: Following the end of her entertainment career, Shirley, pictured in 1979, served as a U.S. ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia . Second marriage: Shirley pictured with her husband Charles Black, who died August 2005, in April 1950, months before their wedding . In 2006, Temple received the Screen . Actors Guild's Lifetime Achievement Award for having 'lived the most . remarkable life, as the brilliant performer the world came to know when . she was just a child to the dedicated public servant who has served her . country both at home and abroad for 30 years'. At the awards, Temple quipped: 'I have one piece of advice for those of you who want to receive the lifetime achievement award. Start early.' The world's most famous child star had a surprisingly modest take on her achievements. 'I . class myself with Rin Tin Tin,' she said once, referring to the canine . star. 'At the end of the Depression, people were perhaps looking for . something to cheer themselves up. They fell in love with a dog and a . little girl. It won't happen again.' She is survived by her children Susan, Charles Jr, and Lori, granddaughter Teresa and great-granddaughters Lily and Emma.

"Benetton was forced to pull into a humiliating climbdown today as the clothing company was forced to pull one of its images from its new 'Unhate' campaign. The Italian firm withdrew the photograph featuring Pope Benedict XVI kissing a senior Egyptian imam on the lips after the Vatican denounced it as an unacceptable provocation. Benetton had claimed its 'Unhate' campaign, which was launched today, was aimed at fostering tolerance and 'global love' but would have known how much trouble they were likely to stir up. The campaign's adverts include digitally altered pictures half a dozen world leaders to show them kissing. Controversial: This mocked-up image of the Pope embracing Ahmed Mohamed el-Tayeb as part of Benetton's new advertising campaign has been called 'totally unacceptable' by the Vatican . Edgy: Benetton's Unhate Campaign includes this picture of U.S. President Barack Obama and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez kissing . President Barack Obama kisses . Venezuela's socialist leader Hugo Chavez, Israeli Prime Minister . Benjamin Netanyahu locks lips with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, . and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il also enjoys a smooch with South . Korean President Lee Myung-bak. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and . French president Nicolas Sarkozy also take time out from dealing with . the financial crisis engulfing Europe to give each other a smacker. But it is the shot of His Holiness . planting a kiss on Sheik Ahmed el-Tayeb of Cairo's al-Azhar institute, . the pre-eminent theological school of Sunni Islam, that has raised the . strongest objections. It been on Benetton's website all day but was pulled about an hour after the Vatican's protest. Al-Azhar suspended interfaith talks . with the Vatican earlier this year after Benedict called for greater . protections for Egypt's minority Christians. Mocked-up: Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel in a clinch with French president Nicolas Sarkozy . Friendly: This image of Palestian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu kissing will no doubt upset some people in the Middle East . A Benetton spokesman confirmed this afternoon that the Pope-imam ad was no longer part of the campaign. Images were unfurled in Milan, New York, Paris, Tel Aviv and Rome, but a large banner of the image has been removed from a spot near the Vatican. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico . Lombardi called the ad an 'unacceptable' manipulation of the pope's . likeness that offended the religious sentiments of the faithful. 'It shows a serious lack of respect for the Pope,' Lombardi said. Shock ads have long been a part of . Benetton's publicity strategy, with photographer Oliviero Toscani's . famous campaigns featuring death row inmates and people dying of AIDS. Combating hatred: Benetton hope the controversial images will help create tolerance around the world. This picture shows China's leader Hu Jintao and Barack Obama . Enemies: North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Lee Myung-bak, President of South Korea, are unlikely to be keen on this picture . Benetton said the photographs of . political and religious leaders kissing were 'symbolic images of . reconciliation - with a touch of ironic hope and constructive . provocation - to stimulate reflection on how politics, faith and ideas, . when they are divergent and mutually opposed, must still lead to . dialogue and mediation.' In a statement, the Treviso-based manufacturer said: 'We are sorry that the use of an image of . the pontiff and the imam should have offended the sensibilities of the . faithful in this way. We have decided with immediate effect to withdraw . this image from every publication.' Attention: People look at a Benetton clothing store window in Paris which is covered by posters as part of its new provocative campaign . According to the Wall Street Journal, Alessandro Benetton, deputy chairman of Benetton Group SpA and son of the founder of the family-controlled company, said: 'It means not hating.

Nizzear Rodriguez celebrated his thirteenth birthday with his grandmother at Applebee's on Saturday night, and hours later he was killed in his bedroom in Carrollton, Georgia. Witnesses heard gunfire between 1am and 3am on Sunday at the Bristol Lakes Apartments - but authorities believe the television in the home may have drowned out the sound, WSBTV reported.

"A British mother has been left to bring up her daughter alone after her American husband was kicked out of the country – because he  had cancer. Distraught Lorraine Marx, 56, nursed her husband Ralph Marx, also 56, when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. But the Home Office ruled he had become a burden on the taxpayer – despite having private health cover – after the NHS billed him £98,000 for the emergency cancer treatment he had received. Family: Lorraine Marx (left), 56, of Chidham, West Sussex, nursed her partner Ralph Marx (centre), also 56, when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. They have 10-year-old daughter Alexandra (right) Mrs Marx, a former Royal Navy chief petty officer, watched helplessly as against medical advice he was escorted on to a plane and deported. The couple, from Chidham in West Sussex, who have a ten-year-old daughter, Alexandra, married in 2001 but Mr Marx chose not to apply for residency status. It meant the chemical engineer was allowed to stay in Britain for only six months at a time, but his work for an international company meant he often travelled abroad on business so the limit was not an issue. But his cancer diagnosis and hospital treatment meant he was at risk of over-staying his visitor status. Mr Marx surrendered his passport in 2012 and applied for UK residency. However, the Home Office rejected it and ordered he leave Britain immediately. A later application from his new home in Tennessee was also rejected when the Home Office ruled he was at risk of drawing on public funds. Decision: The Home Office (whose offices in Central London are pictured) ruled he had become a burden on the taxpayer and the NHS billed him £98,000 for the cancer treatment he had received . Partners of British citizens who wish to apply to remain in the country on the basis of their relationship must meet an array of criteria set out by the UK Border Agency. They must prove that they and their other half are both over 18, that their relationship is 'genuine and subsisting', that any marriage or civil partnership is valid under UK law, and that they intend to live with their partner permanently in the UK. UKBA also requires proof that would-be British citizens have met their partner in person, that the couple in question are not related in any way that would prevent them marrying under UK law, and that any previous relationship has permanently broken down. Finally the applicant must show that they meet UKBA's list of 'suitability requirements', along with its English language requirement, and its financial requirement. This states that any non-national hoping to remain in the country on the grounds that their partner is a British citizen must have an income of at least £18,600. If the applicant has a child that is not a citizen or settled in the country that they wish to live with them in the country, the minimum income goes up to £22,400. Each additional child requires an additional income of £2,400. The . Home Office says the rules are intended to ensure people coming to . Britain to join their spouse or partner do not become a burden on the . taxpayer. In the case . of Ralph Marx, his application was rejected . after they ruled he would indeed be a burden. But Mrs Marx claims when her husband was . taken into hospital she revealed he had private health cover but was . told that because his life was at risk his treatment would be on the . NHS. She said: ‘I pointed out that Ralph wasn’t British but they were . wonderful, telling me not to worry – as my husband, he was entitled to . treatment.’ A judge upheld the family’s appeal in January, but the . Home Office is contesting the decision and Mr Marx continues to live in . America. The case is to be heard tomorrow. Schoolgirl Alexandra has seen her father only once in the past year. Mr Marx is currently in remission but has not had access to his medical team since he has been away. Mrs Marx said: ‘I was stunned when the Home Office rejected Ralph’s application. We’d tried so hard to be positive, and after Ralph had been so sick it was almost too much to bear. ‘To then receive the NHS bill made me feel like someone had thumped me in the stomach.’ The NHS has now dropped its demand for payment. Mrs Marx added: ‘I just don’t know where to go now or what more we can do. ‘We’ve provided every document they’ve ever asked for and abided by all the rules. ‘With all the major issues the Government has to tackle, I can’t believe they are working so hard to keep a decent, taxpaying family apart. It can’t benefit anyone. ‘The only person I’ve managed to speak to at the Home Office asked why we don’t just go and live in America. But this is our home. ‘I’ve paid hundreds of thousands of pounds in taxes over the years and never received a penny in  benefits. I understand that my husband is not entitled to any support – we’ve never asked for any.’ Across the pond: An application from Mr Marx's new home in Tennessee was rejected when the Home Office ruled he was at risk of drawing on public funds. A file image of Nashville is pictured . Mr Marx said: ‘The Home Office is well aware that we are financially stable for the long term. ‘I can only pray that I will get to see my family soon. I miss them desperately and hate the pain this is causing my wife and little girl. ‘We are not scroungers. We can support ourselves and have done so all of our lives. But we are being treated as criminals.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are appealing the decision because we believe it did not apply the immigration rules correctly. ‘Our family rules have been designed to make sure that those coming to the UK to join their spouse or partner will not become a burden on the taxpayer and will be well enough supported to integrate effectively.’ Barman Justin Tutt, 29, told last year how he was facing having his two children taken into care 8,500 miles away after being told he was not earning enough to keep them in the UK. Mr Tutt brought his son Seth, eight and five-year-old daughter Leigh to live in England with him following the sudden death of their mother in their native South Africa. But despite Mr Tutt holding a British passport and having another son born in the UK, under new immigration rules, Seth and Leigh cannot stay here as they must be living in a family earning at least £22,500 a year. Ethan James Feltham, 23, of South Wales, served in the armed forces in Afghanistan - but he earns just short of the £18,600 he needs to earn for his Fijian wife to live in Britain. This is despite him working 60 hours a week as a restaurant chef. UK officials do not believe his wife - whom he met through a military friend - will leave if she comes to stay.","Lorraine Marx, 56, nursed husband when he was diagnosed with leukaemia .

"The global war on heroin, cocaine and cannabis is failing to stem supply, as prices of these drugs have tumbled while seizures of them have risen, according to a study published this week. Researchers analysed data from seven government-funded programmes that tracked the illegal drug market over more than a decade. Three of the programmes monitored international drugs trafficking; three focused on the United States; and one tracked the drugs business in Australia. Battle: The global war on heroin, cocaine and cannabis is failing to stem supply, as prices of these drugs have tumbled while seizures of them have risen, according to a study published Monday . Seized: A soldier guards a shipment cocaine seized in a large clandestine laboratory for the production of the drug, during its presentation to the press in Colombia . United States: The prices of heroin, cocaine and . cannabis tumbled by 81 percent, 80 percent and 86 percent respectively . between 1990 and 2007 in the United States when adjusted for inflation, . the researchers found. Over the same period, the average purity of these drugs rose by 60 percent, 11 percent and 161 percent respectively. Europe: In 18 European countries, the street price of cocaine and heroin fell by 51 and 74 percent between 2000 and 2009. Neither the purity of drugs seized in Europe nor the price of cannabis on the continent was given in the study. Australia: The inflation-adjusted price of cocaine fell by . 14 percent between 2000 and 2010, and that of heroin and cannabis by 49 . percent. The prices of heroin, cocaine and cannabis tumbled by 81 percent, 80 percent and 86 percent respectively between 1990 and 2007 in the United States when adjusted for inflation, the researchers found.

In 18 European countries, the street price of cocaine and heroin fell by 51 and 74 percent between 2000 and 2009. Neither the purity of drugs seized in Europe nor the price of cannabis on the continent was given in the study. In Australia, meanwhile, the inflation-adjusted price of cocaine fell by 14 percent between 2000 and 2010, and that of heroin and cannabis by 49 percent. 'During this time, seizures of these drugs in major domestic markets generally increased,' said the study's authors, led by Evan Wood of the Urban Health Research Initiative in Vancouver, Canada. 'With few exceptions... illegal drug prices have generally decreased while drug purity has generally increased since 1990,' they added. The global supply of illicit drugs had likely not been reduced in the last two decades, the study said, and the availability of cannabis and opiates like heroin may even have increased. Part of the reason for the decrease could be because many users have turned to legal highs after being priced out the drug market during periods of increased cost. Global issue: Women step on dried coca leaves before leaves are sent to clandestine labs where they will be processed and turned into cocaine paste in the village of Lagunilla, Cuzco, Peru . Crackdown: Customs agents confiscate packets of drugs in front of Special Operations Spanish Tax Agency ship 'Petrel' at the Military Arsenal of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria last month . 'These findings suggest that expanding efforts at controlling the global illegal drug market though law enforcement are failing,' said the paper published in the open-access journal BMJ Open. The findings coincide with debate in several countries about whether to loosen laws on certain drugs. Uruguay in August took a step towards becoming the world's first nation to produce and distribute marijuana after its lower house of parliament approved a bill putting control of the drug in government hands. In a 2011 report, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated the global illegal drug trade to be worth at least $350 billion (259 billion euros) annually.","Researchers analysed data from seven government-funded programmes .

"An ex-husband who allegedly stabbed his former wife 84 times before putting a pig mask on her face told police he could not remember the savage attack. Anthony Novellino, 66, from Denville, New Jersey, was in court on Thursday for a hearing ahead of his murder trial. Two recorded interviews with Novellino were played to the Morristown court, the first time details of the grisly killing have been made public. Novellino is accused of stabbing to death his ex-wife Judith, 62, after she returned to their home to collect belongings, 11 days after their divorce in June 2010.

"Cristiano Ronaldo will battle Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer for the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday night. Here, PETE JENSON argues why the Real Madrid and Portugal superstar should be crowned the world's best player. The greatest individual feat in football in 2014 was Cristiano Ronaldo’s 17 Champions League goal-haul that smashed the scoring record for one season in the competition and helped Real Madrid finally land the their 10th European Cup. For so long Ruud van Nistelrooy’s 12 goal-campaign for Manchester United in 2003 had set the bar but then first Messi with 15 and Ronaldo with 17 took the standard to new levels. Ronaldo did so in a year when Real Madrid finally became the first side in football to win 10 European Cups. He did it when the pressure and expectation were on him and that’s why the Portuguese should win the Ballon d’Or. Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid celebrates after scoring their fourth goal against Atletico Madrid . Ronaldo's iconic celebration after scoring against their Madrid rivals in the Champions League final . Click here as Kieran Gill argues why Barcelona superstar Messi should win . FIFA seem to want the award to be a further glorification of their World Cup and would prefer a German won the prize because they won the World Cup in Brazil last summer. But the World Cup is a team event won by the best team, this is an individual honour and just as in 2010 when there was no one Spaniard who stood out above all others in their brilliant World Cup-winning side, the Germans also had no one outstanding individual. Manuel Neuer wasn’t even the best goalkeeper in the tournament so his place on the podium is contestable. If you want to pick a German player why not the irrepressible Thomas Muller or the impeccable Phillip Lahm in what was his final major tournament? Or even Toni Kroos, who has just been voted German player of the year in his homeland. Neuer was also in goal the night his club side Bayern Munich were beaten 4-0 on their own ground with Ronaldo scoring twice in the Champions League semi-final. That was arguably the club performance of the year and Ronaldo was at the heart of it with Neuer the victim. Ronaldo also shared the Golden Shoe with Luis Suarez for his 31 goals and if concerns over his fitness had not meant he had to sit out several key games towards the end of the season he would have scored more and even kept Real Madrid in the Spanish title race. Manuel Neuer wasn’t even the best goalkeeper in the tournament so his place on the podium is contestable . Ronaldo kisses his Golden Shoe award as best European goalscorer in November at the Bernabeu . Click here as Adam Shergold argues why Germany goalkeeper Neuer should win . It wasn’t just his goals in 2014. He showed leadership and sacrifice working for the side and fully taking on board coach Carlo Ancelotti’s demand for team-ethic to override all striving for personal spotlight. He let that super-sized ego get the better of him when he scored the last goal in the 4-1 Champions League final win over Atletico Madrid, ripping off his shirt and posing by the corner flag as if he had baked the cake and not just been the one who put the cherry on the top. But we should forgive him that – the emotion of winning the club’s most sought-after piece of silverware on home soil would have got to anyone. It’s true after the rigours of the season he ran out of gas before the World Cup and the fitness issues and general circus that surrounded him while he was at Portugal’s Caminos training base in Sao Paulo state stayed in the memory longer than his performances. A topless stalker, the Brazilian former ‘Miss bumbum’ beauty contest winner Andressa Urach had to be given a restraining order to stay away from him after trying to get to him while he was training and that all made for a very bizarre end to his season, especially when he was unable to let the football take centre-stage once he was back on the pitch. After the rigours of the season Ronaldo ran out of gas before the 2014 World Cup with Portugal . Ronaldo poses during the unveiling ceremony of a statue of himself in his home town . But once recovered from the World Cup he has hit the ground running this season, racing to the 20-goal mark before most players have worn their new boots in. No-one had the perfect year. Messi won no major honours with Barcelona and is perhaps fortunate to make the podium ahead of Diego Godin, who led Atletico Madrid to La Liga glory, scoring the winner in the match that made them champions, and scoring in the World Cup for Uruguay against Italy as his country qualified from Group D ahead of the Azzurri and England. Angel di Maria, who was man of the match in the Champions League final and a scorer in both the Spanish Cup final and the World Cup quarter-finals, could also argue he had a better year than Messi. This is not a ‘who is the greatest player in the world?’ competition. If it was, Ronaldo might also win it although it would be much harder to separate him and Messi. This is an achievement award for a calendar year in football and Ronaldo’s Champions League campaign is what should see him scoop his second FIFA Ballon d’Or.

"A trained terrorist from Norway is awaiting orders to carry out an attack on the West, officials from three European security agencies have revealed. The man is believed to have received terrorist training from Al Qaeda's offshoot in Yemen and is ready to strike. Western intelligence officials have long feared such a scenario - a convert to Islam who is trained in terrorist methods and can blend in easily in Europe and the U.S., traveling without visa restrictions. Anti-terrorism forces during a training session in a suburb of the Yemeni capital Sana'a. Yemen is thought to be a fertile breeding ground for al Qaeda . Officials from three European security agencies confirmed the man is 'operational,' meaning he has completed his training and is about to receive a target. All spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly. They declined to name the man, who has not been accused of a crime. 'We believe he is operational and he is probably about to get his target,' one security official said. 'And that target is probably in the West.' A security official in a second European country confirmed the information, adding: 'From what I understand, a specific target has not been established.' European security services, including in Norway, have warned in recent years of homegrown, radicalised Muslims traveling to terror training camps in conflict zones. Many of the known cases involve young men with family roots in Muslim countries. But the latest case involves a man in his 30s with no immigrant background, the officials said. Chilling echo: Anders Behring Breivik, pictured on trial in Oslo, killed 77 people in a bombing-and-shooting massacre on July 22 . After converting to Islam in 2008, he quickly became radicalized and traveled to Yemen to receive terror training, one of the officials said. The man spent 'some months' in Yemen and is still believed to be there, he said. The official said the man has no criminal record, which would also make him an ideal recruit for Al Qaeda. 'Not even a parking ticket,' he said. 'He's completely clean and he can travel anywhere.' The official would not specify what preventive measures were being taken but said 'there is a well-established relationship between Western security services, and they share the information needed to prevent terrorism.' Richard Reid, the British citizen accused of trying to blow up an aircraft with explosives in his shoes . The officials declined to specify what makes them think the man is operational. Signs that a would-be jihadist is ready for an attack could include the creation of so-called martyrdom videos for release online in conjunction with an attack, or an abrupt cutoff of communication and contacts with peers to avoid detection. The man has not been accused of a crime in Norway, where traveling abroad to attend terror training camps is not a crime per se. In many European countries, suspects are not named unless they have been formally charged with a crime. Yemeni military officials said they had information on Europeans training with Al Qaeda in the southern part of the country but that they weren't aware of a Norwegian being among them. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. CIA and FBI officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the AP report. Trond Hugubakken, a spokesman for Norway's PST security service, also declined to comment on the case. He referred to a PST security assessment in February, which highlighted that 'several' Islamic extremists have traveled from Norway to conflict zones to attend training camps. Hugubakken acknowledged that converts who turn to violent extremism pose a particular challenge. 'Converts will have a different level of cover, especially if they have no criminal record,' he said, adding that most Muslim converts do not turn to extremism. There are several examples in Europe and the U.S. of converts linked to terror plots, from failed shoe-bomber Richard Reid, a British convert, to a Pennsylvania woman dubbed 'Jihad Jane,' who pleaded guilty last year to charges that she plotted to kill a Swedish cartoonist who caricatured Islam's Prophet Muhammad. Norway saw the first convictions under its anti-terror laws this year when two men were given prison terms in January for plotting to attack a Danish newspaper that also had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad. In March, Mullah Krekar, a radical Iraqi-born cleric who came to Norway as a refugee, was sentenced to five years in prison for making death threats against Norwegian officials and three Kurdish men he claimed had insulted Islam. But Norway's most serious attacks happened last year at the hands of a right-wing, anti-Muslim extremist, Anders Behring Breivik, who admitted to killing 77 people in a bombing-and-shooting massacre on July 22. The self-styled militant's trial ended last week with conflicting claims about whether he is criminally insane. A verdict has been set for August 24.","Officials from three European agencies reveal fear .

"Charles and Lisa Black moved to Maine . after careers as teachers in Kansas, pursuing an idyllic retirement that . prosecutors say was destroyed by arguments over money and infidelity . before both plummeted off a cliff. That's the story presented by prosecutors Tuesday during opening arguments in the trial of Charles Black, 71, who appeared in Knox County Superior Court Tuesday. District Attorney Geoffrey Rushlau argued Charles wanted his wife dead so he could inherit her father's millions. Prosecutors argued Charles Black wanted his wife dead so he could inherit her father's millions . Yahoo reports that the couple were fighting over spending and that Lisa Black had discovered her husband was in the midst of an online affair. 'What you’ll hear is evidence of two motives: one, money, and the second, another woman,' Rushlau told the court. Prosecutors . say 71-year-old Charles Black hit his wife on the head with a rock . before pushing her off the 800-foot Maiden Cliff in April 2011 in in . Camden Hills State Park. 'She’ll . tell you that she was begging for her life, that she was speaking about . her two daughters and begging that he not do this,' Rushlau said. She survived by landing on a rock ledge just feet from the mountain top. Lisa Black, 55, says she believed Charles was . chasing her when he, too, tumbled down the mountain, according to a . police report. Law . enforcement officials have said Lisa Black received a $4 million . inheritance from her father, and she and Charles Black had a dispute . over how he spent some of the money without her permission. Lisa has . also accused Charles Black of having an online affair. But Charles Black's attorney argues he had no reason to kill his wife, and that there is no physical evidence to back their story up. 'What you’ll have to conclude is that it just didn’t happen the way that Lisa Black said it did at all,' said attorney Walter McKee. Charles . Black now lives in Salt Lake City and faces numerous charges, including . attempted murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in . prison. The prosecution has also asked the court for permission to . introduce evidence that he had earlier tried to poison Lisa Black. McKee attempted to have the charges dismissed over . the way prosecutors obtained hundreds of pages of Black's medical . records. Lisa Black says she believes Charles was chasing her when he, too, fell down the mountain . He has said prosecutors used 'secret search warrants' to get . Black's the records and should have subpoenaed them instead. McKee lost . the bid for dismissal in April. McKee . said he expects the trial to take two weeks. He said the recent . accusation of poisoning is 'bizarre' and the state can expect 'a . vigorous challenge.' Calls . to Lisa Black and Charles Black were not returned. Police said the . couple was hiking on Mount Megunticook when the fall occurred. Lisa . Black fell a short distance down the mountain, stood up and ran to seek . help. Charles Black also fell down the mountain - a police report said . Lisa believed he was chasing her - and both suffered serious injuries. He . told police he fainted, fell forward and hit the back of Lisa Black's . head with his own head, but he had no memory of pushing her off the . cliff. They divorced in 2013 after nine years of marriage. The . Blacks are former Johnson County, Kansas, teachers who had moved to . Maine about a year earlier. Lisa Black had taught fourth grade while . Charles Black was a social studies teacher. A . judge banned Charles Black from staying in Camden during the trial. Prosecutors have said Lisa Black is concerned about her safety if .

"Melvin Morris was commanding a strike force on a mission near Chi Lang, South Vietnam, when his special forces group came under attack and a fellow commander was killed near an enemy bunker. Despite massive enemy fire directed at him and his men, hitting him three times, 72-year-old Morris said he was able to get to his fallen comrade and recover the body. He also retrieved a map that included strategic information that would have been trouble if it fell into enemy hands. More than four decades later, as a way to try to correct potential acts of bias spanning three wars, President Barack Obama will bestow the Medal of Honor on the Florida man and 23 other veterans. Righting a wrong: More than 40 years since serving on a heroic mission in South Vietnam, Melvin Morris will receive a Medal of Honor initially denied to him because he was black . They come after a decade-long congressionally mandated review of minorities who may have been passed over for the U.S. military's highest honor because of long-held prejudices. Morris became one of the first soldiers to don a 'green beret' in 1961 and volunteered twice for deployments to Vietnam during the war. After his Sept 17, 1969, ordeal, the then-Staff Sgt. Morris received a Distinguished Service Cross in 1970. He said he never realized that being black might have kept the higher honor from him. 'I never really did worry about decorations,' Morris said. He got a huge surprise when the Army contacted him in May and arranged for Obama to call him at his Cocoa home. 'I fell to my knees, I was shocked,' Morris said. 'President Obama said he was sorry this didn't happen before. He said this should have been done 44 years ago.' Man of courage: Melvin Morris became one of the first soldiers to don a 'green beret' in 1961 and volunteered twice for deployments to Vietnam during the war . The unusual mass ceremony, scheduled for March 18, will honor veterans, most of Hispanic or Jewish heritage, who already had been recognized with the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest military award. Morris is one of only three of the recipients still living. The others are Spc. 4 Santiago J. Erevia of San Antonio, cited for courage during a search and clear mission near Tam Ky, South Vietnam, on May 21, 1969; and Sgt. 1st Class Jose Rodela of San Antonio, cited for courage during combat operations in Phuoc Long province, South Vietnam, on Sept. 1, 1969. The Army conducted the review under a directive from Congress in the 2002 National Defense Authorization Act. The law required that the record of each Jewish American and Hispanic American veteran who received a Service Cross during or after World War II be reviewed for possible upgrade to the Medal of Honor. Finally recognized: In addition to Morris, the two other living Medal of Honor recipients are Spec. 4 Santiago J. Erevia (left) and Sgt. 1st Class Jose Rodela (right) The Pentagon said the Army reviewed the cases of the 6,505 recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars and found an eligible pool of 600 soldiers who may have been Jewish or Hispanic. Of the 24, eight fought in the Vietnam War, nine in the Korean War and seven in World War II. 'From the beginning of the encounter, until he was medically evacuated, Morris reacted to each situation with a professionalism, and single-minded determination possessed by few men,' according to the information released by the Army about Morris. He had to keep the medal a secret since Obama's call and said he's happy to be honored, but that it's even more important to recognize his friends that never returned home. 'Those that aren't even here to receive their medals, those are my heroes,' said Morris, who retired from the Army in 1986 as a sergeant first class. 'They gave their whole life.

"Manuel Neuer will battle Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday night. Here, ADAM SHERGOLD argues why the Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper should be crowned the world's best player. I believe that Manuel Neuer should win the Ballon d'Or on Monday night. No wait, do bear with me. The nomination of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for this world player award was as inevitable as night following day, with the rest challenging for just one place. And, in my view, it was fitting that Neuer, goalkeeper for Bayern Munich and Germany, should take it following a quite exceptional year that saw him establish himself as the undisputed No 1 of No 1s and conquer the world. Manuel Neuer will go up against Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or on Monday night . The goalkeeper helped Germany to World Cup glory during the summer, lifting the trophy in the Maracana . Neuer's Germany defeated Lionel Messi's Argentina 1-0 in the final, claiming a fourth World Cup triumph . Games Played: 51 . Clean Sheets: 28 . Saves: 122 . Touches: 2,270 . Keeper sweepings: 95 . HONOURS . World Cup (Germany); Bundesliga; German Cup (Bayern Munich) German Footballer of the Year; IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper; UEFA Team of the Year; Champions League Team of the Season; World Cup Golden Glove; World Cup All-Star Team; World Cup Dream Team . The first thing to reflect on is just how Neuer has come to revolutionise and redefine what it takes to be a goalkeeper. He has invented the 'sweeper-keeper' role - the man actually redefined the one position in the game of football that is incredibly difficult to redefine. Neuer not only excels in all the traditional attributes of goalkeeping - he is tall, strong, imposing, brave, intelligent and an outstanding shot stopper with excellent distribution. But he is also unafraid to roam 30, 40, 50 yards from his line to indulge in that self-taught 'sweeper' role. He snuffs out opposition attacks before they can even be conceived and is just as much an orchestrator of an attack as the defence or midfield. On occasions when Bayern are in their glorious full flow, pinning opponents back into their defensive third, Neuer can usually be found on the halfway line. This is probably how all goalkeepers will play in a few years’ time and Neuer will rightly be viewed as a pioneer. Neuer also enjoyed an exceptional 2013-14 season with Bayern, winning the Bundesliga and the German Cup . Neuer makes his stunning one-handed save from Karim Benzema of France in the World Cup quarter-final . Neuer's stop from the French striker was a pivotal moment in Germany's World Cup campaign . Click here as Kieran Gill argues why Barcelona superstar Messi should win . The second, and most obvious, point to make is that Neuer won the World Cup in 2014. In the process, he conceded just four goals in seven matches, quite impressive considering how high-scoring the tournament was. Did Messi win the World Cup? Well, almost, but no cigar. Did Ronaldo win the World Cup? Not even close. Still stuck in the group stage I'm afraid. Might as well have not bothered turning up. The highlight from Neuer was that one-handed save from France's Karim Benzema in the quarter-final. It was one of the important little vignettes that made up Germany's golden summer. Fearless, defiant, 'you-shall-not-pass' keeping. Neuer, like the rest of that Germany team, kept his head together under the immense weight of expectation that comes with reaching the latter stages of the World Cup. No other team at the tournament had the unity, camaraderie and professionalism of the Germans - they were deserved champions and Neuer was worthy winner of the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper.

That World Cup triumph came off the back of another exceptional campaign with Bayern, who won the Bundesliga and the German Cup, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. It's the facts and figures that best illustrate Neuer's command for his club. In 2013-14, he kept a remarkable 25 clean sheets for Bayern. This season, he has shut out 13 of their 17 league opponents. Indeed, in the calendar year of 2014, Neuer conceded just 14 league goals - an astonishing statistic that underlines Bayern's dominance in the German league. They have set so many new records in the past few months, going so many games undefeated, that they had to pretty much perform an exorcism on the record books. Sure, Ronaldo won the Champions League in 2014. But I think you’ll find Neuer won it in 2013, thank you very much. Been there, done that and, unlike Ronaldo, kept on the shirt. Messi won nothing over the year, so that should rule him out straight away. What’s more, goalkeepers are always under-valued and under-appreciated. Goalkeepers never get the glory, they never hog the limelight like Messi or Ronaldo. They’re not prima donnas, they just get on with it. Neuer makes a 'Superman' style save during Bayern's match with Hertha Berlin at the end of November . Leaping to take a catch during Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier with Gibraltar in Nuremberg back in November . Making himself as imposing as possible during a Bayern Munich match with Hertha Berlin this season .

They have been so vitally important to all successful teams through football history, yet only one has ever won the Ballon d’Or – the great Lev Yashin back in 1963. And that brings me to my final point. Neuer should win in Zurich for the sake of the Ballon d’Or and for the sake of the game. Don’t get me wrong, I love both Messi and Ronaldo and love the way they continue to inspire one another to ever-greater heights. But since 2008, they have locked out first and second place every year except 2010. That year, Andres Iniesta came second and in order to do that he had to score the winning goal in the World Cup final. Frankly, it’s getting a bit boring. Let’s turn our besotted gaze away from their never-ending game of one-upmanship and celebrate somebody else. And if, in a year when he won the World Cup, the Double with Bayern and been so frugal in conceding goals to make Ebenezer Scrooge look generous, Neuer doesn't claim the prize there really is no justice.","Manuel Neuer up against Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in Zurich .

"Lionel Messi will battle Cristiano Ronaldo and Manuel Neuer for the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday night. Here, KIERAN GILL argues why the Barcelona and Argentina superstar should be crowned the world's best player. ‘Lionel Messi broke another record yesterday...’ How many times have those words been written, read, or dropped into conversation since the great Messi won his first Ballon d’Or six years ago? On Monday  he can win an unprecedented fifth. And to sum up why, just look at the 27-year-old's records between January 1 and December 31, 2014: . And we could name more. Barcelona's Lionel Messi holds up a trophy after being honoured for breaking La Liga's goalscoring record . Messi became the all-time top goalscorer in La Liga history in 2014 and received the trophy on Sunday . Messi, right was on target - with Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar (centre) - in Sunday's win over Atletico Madrid . 53 - games in 2014 . 4,748 - minutes played . 49 - goals . 15 - goals with right foot . 32 - goals with left foot . 2 - headers . 96.90 - minutes per goal . 17 - assists . This is why the Ballon d’Or was established by magazine, France Football, back in 1956 when Sir Stanley Matthews won it first: to recognise the history-makers. What we’re led to believe by FIFA is the criteria calls for national managers, captains and  journalists to vote for the most outstanding performer of the previous 12 months. Yet this was no ordinary year. Messi’s name  on the ballot had Cristiano Ronaldo and Manuel Neuer for competition. Excessive criticism reared its ugly head at times, but the architect of Barcelona and Argentina was unfazed. In La Liga, Messi scored 35 goals in 36 matches. Broken down to 11 with the right foot, 23 with the left, the other with the head, despite the odd injury. Ronaldo scored 38 but was less versatile, getting four with his unfavourable left foot and head. Yet he is the dribbler, the creator, the orchestrator, right? Not entirely. There’s a statistic for that, too. Messi created 97 chances in La Liga during 2014 - 24 more than any other player - and completed 164 dribbles - 63 more than his nearest rival. Not Ronaldo, but Athletic Bilbao’s Iker Muniain. Messi created 97 chances in La Liga during 2014 - 24 more than any other player - and completed 164 dribbles . Barcelona's Messi celebrates with team-mates after setting a La Liga goalscoring record of 253 . Click here as Adam Shergold argues why Germany goalkeeper Neuer should win . It carried to Europe. Messi, channelling his inner Alexander the Great, conquered Nicosia, Cyprus, on November 25 to become the all-time top goalscorer in the Champions League. It was his 23rd European city, his 16th European country, and a record 24th different stadium in which he had scored. The world's media ran out of ways to describe him. 'Senor Record! There are no limits to this extra-terrestrial,' ran one headline. 'A miracle,' ran another. All this, just about the time Ballon d'Or votes were being submitted. Timing can be everything. And so to Brazil between June 12 and July 13. Was he to be Argentina’s modern-day Diego Maradona circa 1986? The running joke was the Barca boy had such sway over Alejandro Sabella that he could make tactical calls. The hearsay being Messi told the Argentina manager to change to 4-3-3 against Bosnia-Herzegovina at half-time in their Group H opener on June 15, and he obliged. Was it true? Probably not. But it worked. Messi single-handedly broke the hearts of the Bosnians, then the Iranians, then the Nigerians. Three for three. Argentina's Messi celebrates scoring his side's goal against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Brazil . Messi and Argentina ultimately could not win the 2014 World Cup but the Barca boy carried them to the final .

Messi and Manuel Neuer (left) after the 2014 World Cup final, which the Barca star narrowly lost . Click here as Pete Jenson argues why Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo should win . Do the maths and his four goals directly contributed seven points. The difference between qualifying and going home, tails tucked between legs. Messi carried Argentina to the World Cup final. Yet that’s where it ended. Neuer won it, but was not necessarily better than the 10 Germans in front of him. Ronaldo, meanwhile, was cursing his luck in Group G. The Golden Ball, reserved for the tournament's best player, went to Messi, though not without scrutiny, even from 'a little surprised' FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Yet he got to Rio de Janeiro, and was crowned most outstanding player on the world stage after winning four man-of-the-match awards towards the final. It is perhaps a symptom of being the best. When so much is expected, failure is practically unacceptable. His four-year reign over the Ballon d’Or ended in Zurich last year, cutting some figure in a red suit and black bow tie. Ronaldo, rightly, had his turn, and Messi had 2014 to fix it. This is no slanging match. Far from it. All three candidates, in their own way, have a right to win the famous, old trophy. But, come Monday night, when he could win an unprecedented fifth Ballon d’Or, maybe that same, old phrase will resurface the next morning: ‘Lionel Messi broke another record yesterday...’ Messi  and partner Antonella Roccuzzo arrive during the Ballon d'Or awards last year in January . Messi will be looking to win an unprecedented fifth Ballon d'Or against Cristiano Ronaldo and Neuer .","Lionel Messi battles Cristiano Ronaldo and Manuel Neuer for Ballon d'Or .

"The family of a murdered 27-year-old Georgia student listened to her killer’s confession in which he revealed the moment she ripped off the mask he was wearing and recoiled in horror as she recognized her friend before he strangled her to death. Mercer University School of Law graduate Stephen McDaniel, 28, pleaded guilty to the June 2011 murder of fellow student Lauren Giddings, 27, in court on Monday and provided a full confession as part of his deal. McDaniel's coolly detailed confession of how he startled Lauren awake at 4.30am on Sunday June 26 after he broke into her apartment dressed all in black was paraphrased in part to the court according to the Macon Telegraph. Confession: Lauren Giddings (left) was strangled to death by her friend and next-door neighbor and classmate Stephen McDaniel (seen right in 2011) - who pleaded guilty to the crime in court on Monday in Georgia . Charged: Stephen McDaniel stands before the magistrate at the Bibb County Law Enforcement Center surrounded by Bibb County Bailiffs, his attorney, Macon Police Detective Carl Flecther and District Attorney Greg Winters in June 2011 . 'She saw me and said, very calmly, 'Get the f*** out,' said McDaniel in his confession which outlined how he killed and dismembered Lauren before disposing her remains in a trash dumpster outside the apartment complex they both lived in. 'I leaped across the bed onto her and grabbed her around the throat. We tumbled out of the bed to the floor and in her struggle to get away, she moved her legs and her lower body under her bed, preventing her from getting away or kicking me,' he wrote according to the Macon Telegraph. During their struggle, Lauren managed to rip the mask from McDaniel's face and pleaded,  'Stephen? Please stop'. McDaniel clenched his hands around her throat for 15 minutes until she stopped moving and then 'dragged her into the bathroom and placed her in the bathtub.' Next door neighbors: Stephen McDaniel and Lauren Giddings lived opposite each other on the 2nd floor of this apartment block near to Mercer University's law school . According to this confession he then returned to his apartment next door to Lauren's and spent the entire day on his computer according to the Macon Telegraph. Then, in the evening, he returned with a hacksaw and cut up her body. 'I removed her limbs and head, wrapped them in several black trash bags, separately, and discarded them in the Mercer law school dumpster,' he wrote. The cool killer then said that he put Lauren's torso into the apartment trash can on June 28 - two days before it was found. At the allocution on Monday at Bibb County Superior Court, the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed there was no sign of sexual assault on the corpse. Grizzly discovery: Members of the Bibb County Coroner's office remove a body discovered at Barristers Hall apartments at 1058 Georgia Ave. in downtown Macon in June 2011 . McDaniel has denied raping Lauren. 'She was wearing the pink running shorts when she died and I never removed them,' he wrote. 'They were found on her torso just as I had left them.' Before McDaniels changed his plea, the court had heard how he had spied on Lauren for months, using a camera attached to a 6-foot-long wooden stick - standing beneath her second-floor apartment and videoing her. Prosecutors said Stephen Mark McDaniel faces life in prison for killing 27-year-old Lauren Giddings in Macon in central Georgia in June 2011, the same year that both graduated from the Mercer University School of Law in the city . He had become obsessed with Lauren, his next-door neighbor at Barristers Hall apartments, across the street from Mercer University's law school - where they had been classmates. The court heard he had become devastated that because they were both graduating he would never see her again. In the days after the murder, McDaniel attended class and even joined a search party for Lauren with friends on the night of June 29. He claimed he was 'in a dream-like delusional state' and had convinced himself that Lauren was still alive. Lauren's father told the Macon Telegraph that he believes only one third of McDaniel's account. 'He’s . had a long time to put it together. That’s about as good as he could . get it, and that’s pretty horrible,' Billy Giddings, 58, said. After . the confession was read, Lauren's mother Karen, 53, said that her . family are 'scarred forever by the sheer, exquisite pain of missing . her.' 'We have lived going on three years now an unimaginable nightmare wondering what kind of horror our daughter endured,' she said. The Giddings family requested that McDaniel not face the death penalty. McDaniel was initially charged with breaking into two apartments in the building using a master key he somehow obtained, according to police. McDaniel and Giddings lived in neighboring apartments across the street from the law school . 'We . just don’t want him in our thoughts anymore. ... I hope he lives a long . life in the worst possible way,' said Billy Giddings. Karen Giddings said 'I really can't stand to look at him.' During the course of his confession, McDaniel attempted to justify his murder. He described himself as 'divided in mind, unable to account for how I could have committed these horrible acts and, at the same time, also be able to carry on daily routines.' He went on, 'It’s difficult for me to explain why I killed Lauren and attempted to conceal my deed the way I did. ... I know that it was very wrong; I am not delusional or without all morals or decency.” McDaniel said, 'Something in my makeup — my psychology, my neuropathy (sic), my own particular pathology, perhaps — must explain it.' He expressed remorse according to the Macon Telegraph, saying he grieves Giddings daily, but doesn’t expect forgiveness from her family. 'There is no way I can ever deserve it,” he said. 'If I could take back what happened, I would.' It was the discovery of the video evidence on McDaniel's computer that caused the defense to seek a deal with the prosecution. He will first be eligible to request parole in 2041, but District Attorney David Cooke said, 'I fully expect Stephen McDaniel will spend the rest of his life behind bars.'","Stephen McDaniel provided a confession to the court on Monday which revealed the moment Lauren Giddings realized her killer was her friend .

"Stacey Rambold, 54, was originally sentenced to just 30 days for allegedly grooming a troubled 14-year-old student for sex . A Montana teacher who admitted to raping a troubled 14-year-old student who later committed suicide has been given just 30 days in jail after a judge ruled that the girl was more mature than her age and 'just as in control' of the relationship as the teacher. Cherice Morales' furious mother stormed out of the courtroom Monday after Judge Todd Baugh handed down the sentence, which was less than 1percent of the 10 years prosecutors had demanded. Attorneys for Stacey Dean Rambold, 54, said the teacher has lost his job, his license, his house and his wife and suffered the 'scarlet letter of the Internet' as a result of the allegations. Defense lawyer Jay Lansing said his client had been punished enough for his crime. Judge Baugh, 66, - who said he disagreed with the decision to prosecute Rambold after he was kicked out of sex offender treatment program - announced last week that he is running for re-election and is thus far unopposed. The Billings Gazette reports that Rambold was arrested in 2008 after police and administrators at Billings Senior High School learned that he had targeted 14-year-old Cherice, a troubled freshman at the school, and groomed her for sex. The school district had warned Rambold four years earlier to avoid touching or being alone with female students, it was later revealed. The district paid Cherice's mother $96,000 as part of a wrongful death settlement. The teacher, who was then 49, was charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and prosecutors allege he had an ongoing sexual relationship with the girl. Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice Morales killed herself . Warning: It was later revealed that administrators at Billings Senior High School, pictured, had warned Rambold not to touch female students or be alone with them back in 2004 . Just before her 17th birthday and while the case on still pending, Cherice killed herself. The girl's mother, Auliea Hanlon, says that Rambold's sexual abuse was a 'major factor' in her daughter's suicide. The Gazette reports that with the girl's death, prosecutors were forced to defer prosecution. They agreed to dismiss the case if Rambold admitted to one count of rape and agreed to enter a three-stage sex offender treatment program. In December, prosecutors revived the case and re-filed charges after they learned that the teacher had been kicked out of the program for having unsupervised visits with minors. Rambold's defense lawyer said those minors were his family members.The attorney said Rambold was attending another treatment program and was considered a low risk to re-offend. Rambold, 54, faces another 10 years in prison after the Attorney General's Office filed an appeal on Friday . Her fault? Judge Todd Baugh ruled that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' and that in listening to the girl's police interviews, he came to believe that she was in control of the relationship with her teacher . Judge Baugh seemed to agree. He said that the former teacher's violations at the sex offender treatment program were not enough to warrant prosecution. He also said that when he reviewed taped police interviews with Cherice and concluded that even though she was 35 years younger than Rambold and clearly troubled, she was 'as much in control of the situation' as the teacher, the Gazette reported. Judge Baugh also said that Cherice was 'older than her chronological age' - which mitigated Rambold's crimes. Ms Hanlon, Cherice's mother, stormed out of the courtroom when the judge handed down the ruling and shouted 'You people suck!' at the judge. Montana District Court Judge G. Todd Baugh announced on Monday that Cherice Morales seemed just as responsible for a sexual relationship with her teacher Stacey Dean Rambold as the teacher was - even though Cherice was troubled and only 14 at the time. He also pronounced that the girl, who killed herself two years later, appeared to be 'older than her chronological age.' Baugh, 66, is running for a fifth term overseeing cases in Montana's 13th Judicial District. He has been on the bench since 1986. He announced on August 21 that he is running for re-election. So far, he is running unopposed. He recently told KULR-TV: 'When I was younger I thought, ""By golly, by the time I get to be 66, I'll be way old and ready to retire,"" but then I discovered when I got here that I’m not.' If re-elected in 2014, he would serve another six-year term. He ran unopposed in 2008 and 2002, state elections records show. He is the son of NFL Hall of Fame quarterback 'Slingin'' Sammy Baugh. Baugh did not return a call from MailOnline seeking comment on the case.","Cherice Morales was a troubled 14-year-old high school freshman when teacher Stacey Dean Rambold, then 49, groomed her for sex .

"A teenage victim of Dr Myles Bradbury has told of how the paedophile abused him up to 50 times while his parents sat just meters away . A teenage victim of Dr Myles Bradbury has spoken of the abuse he suffered at the hands of the paedophile NHS doctor and how it occurred as his parents sat just yards away. The victim said the abuse began when he was a 13-year-old patient of Bradbury, and he was abused up to 50 times while being treated for a rare blood disorder. The attacks began in 2008 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. While behind an examination curtain, and with his parents nearby in the same room, the teenager said the doctor sexually assaulted him. The boy's parents only learned of the abuse when police sent letters to up to 800 possible victims. Earlier this week, cancer specialist Bradbury admitted seven counts of sexual assault and 12 of engaging in sexual activity with a child. The victim, who is now a 19-year-old college student, said because Bradbury was a doctor he 'automatically' trusted him. But while carrying out a full body examination he said the doctor touched him. He told the Daily Mirror: 'Because he was a doctor I thought it was completely normal and he did it nearly every time I saw him.' The victim said he was 'shocked' by the abuse because Bradbury had come across as 'such a nice guy'. During every monthly appointment, the victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said Bradbury would examine him for between five to 10 minutes. At the time he thought nothing of it. The boy switched hospitals in January this year and it was at that stage that his family started to become aware of what had taken place. The boy reported that the examinations by his new doctor didn't involve his 'privates'. When the family then received a letter from the police, the abuse became clear. The boy's father said: 'I question myself, thinking 'why didn't I see what was going on?' 'But I also ask myself 'why didn't the NHS pick up on it?''' The victim said Bradbury began abusing him in 2008 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge . The victim said he believes the NHS should have monitored the frequency of his appointments with Bradbury. His family are now considering taking legal action against the NHS. The Trust which employed the 41-year-old told the Mirror that Bradbury's 'cold and calculating' nature meant catching him was difficult. Bradbury was suspended as soon as concerns were raised, a Cambridge University Hospitals Trust spokesman said. Bradbury, of Herringswell, Suffolk, admitted seven counts of sexual assault and 12 of engaging in sexual activity with a child on Monday. 'We were deeply shocked to learn of the charges brought against Dr Bradbury' - Brimingham Children's Hospital chief nurse Michelle McLouglin . He also admitted three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. The hearing was told Bradbury filmed at least one of his 18 known victims, who were aged between eight and 17. He is awaiting sentencing. Meanwhile, Birmingham Children's Hospital has set up a helpline for up to 250 youngpatients treated by Bradbury, who worked there as a registrar and consultant from 2004 to 2008. Chief nurse Michelle McLoughlin said staff were stunned and had moved swiftly to support youngsters treated by Bradbury during his time in the Midlands. She said: 'The safety of the children and young people we care for is our top priority and we were deeply shocked to learn of the charges brought against Dr Bradbury. 'As soon as we were alerted to these allegations in July we contacted the children he treated and their families to offer our support and advice through a helpline. We continue to encourage anyone with a concern to contact our Patient Advice and Liaison Service.' A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said the force was working with the hospital to respondto any concerns from members of the public.","A teenage victim of Myles Bradbury claims he was abused up to 50 times .

"Steven Bruno was found guilty of one felony count of second degree murder on Wednesday in connection with the 2012 crime . A 23-year-old California man has been convicted of murdering his adoptive father in order to steal his car and money so he could visit his internet girlfriend in Ohio. Steven Bruno was found guilty of one felony count of second degree murder on Wednesday in connection with the 2012 crime. Bruno fatally shot his father, 60-year-old Ernest Bruno, in the chest and head at the home they shared at 17 Dartmouth in Irvine on Aug. 30, 2012. After the shooting, Steven Bruno locked the body in a bedroom and left taking his father’s car, cash and credit cards. He was arrested the next day in Colorado after his brother David discovered the crime scene and called the cops. Steven Bruno had been headed for Toledo, Ohio, where he planned a rendezvous with a woman he had been communicating with online for months. Lawyers for the son had argued that the killing wasn't premeditated. They claim he was afraid of his father and had been contemplating suicide the night of the shooting. Defense attorney Leonard Matsuk told jurors that Steven Bruno only opened fire when his father came around a corner and charged at him. The relationship between the pair had soured after Steven had flunked out of a golf management program at Mississippi State University and couldn't get a job back home, his attorneys said. Steven Bruno's brother David stumbled across his father's dead body at the home at 17 Dartmouth in Irvine the day after his murder . Ernest Bruno would sometimes leave for days and lock his son out of the condo where they lived, forcing Steven to live in the garage, Matsuk said. But prosecutor Cynthia Herrera cast Steven Bruno as someone who was intent on meeting with his girlfriend - even if that meant killing his father. ‘He was spoiled and he wanted his way,’ Herrera said during opening statements. The victim and his wife had adopted both the defendant and his brother at birth. Steven Bruno now faces up to 40 years to life in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 18.

"A disabled grandfather on a mobility scooter ambushed his estranged wife then stabbed her six times when she told him their marriage was over, a court heard. Multiple Sclerosis sufferer William Berry, 61, armed himself with two knives and travelled almost three miles on the 5mph scooter from his home to the secondary school where his wife was employed as a kitchen assistant. He waited until Debra Berry, 52, had finished her shift and followed her to a nearby bus stop where the pair discussed a solicitor's letter he had received regarding the family home. William Berry, left, knifed his estranged wife Debra, right, six times before plunging the blade twice into his stomach, a court heard . As she turned away from him, the wheelchair-bound former electricity worker stabbed her six times in the back with a 20cm serrated kitchen knife before she fled to a nearby colleague's house  in Bolton, Greater Manchester. He then turned the knife on himself and plunged the blade twice into his stomach. Horrified witnesses phoned police as Berry holed himself up in a nearby garden during the afternoon of October 15 last year - only dropping the blade when officers threatened to taser him. Recalling the event in a statement, Mrs Berry said her husband came at her with 'gritted teeth' and she is now so scared of knives she has to buy pre-chopped fruit and vegetables from the supermarket. Today, Berry was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison despite pleas to suspend the sentence due to his needs. He was also issued with a restraining order banning him from contacting Mrs Berry for three years. He was further ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120. Bolton Crown Court sitting at Manchester Magistrates' Court heard Berry married his wife in 1999 but was diagnosed with the debilitating neurological condition MS just a year later and his health deteriorated rapidly. He was forced to medically retire from his job with NORWEB and his wife soon became his full-time carer. But the marriage was failing and Mrs Berry eventually left her husband in July last year. Failing to cope with the breakup, Berry persisted in contacting his wife and would phone their mutual friends and wait outside St James' secondary school in Farnworth, Bolton, where she worked. William Berry, pictured,ambushed his estranged wife then stabbed her six times . On the day of the tragedy he had received a letter which he believed meant she was forcing the sale of their home and taking half of the proceedings. It was in fact just to protect herself in case of a future sale as she was preparing to make financial arrangements in regards to his care. However this sparked Berry into deciding he wanted to take his own life in front of his wife - so he left a note for his children, the front door unlocked and set off on his mobility scooter to her place of work. Prosecuting, Nicola Carroll said: 'He accompanied her to the bus stop within yards of the school. They had a brief discussion about the letter from the solicitor and she states that the defendant had his hands on his lap. 'She assumed he needed the toilet and hoped that would mean he would leave her alone. 'She turned her back and he was still on the scooter and as she stood in front of him but with her back to him she felt what she described as a thump to the middle of her back which caused her to fall to the ground. 'She fell to the ground, positioned herself on all fours, turned her head to look at him and saw him still on the scooter holding the knife in his hand and she says he had gritted teeth. 'She then felt another blow to her shoulder and she got up screaming and crying and made her way across the road to the garden of a friend.' Mrs Berry was airlifted to hospital while police dealt with her husband who was telling police he wanted to end his own life. She escaped with just one 2cm wound to her back near her spine and five superficial injuries and she was released from hospital a day later. Berry, of Bolton, was not fit to be interviewed until almost two months later as he began to recover from his self-inflicted wounds, telling police in hospital that he did not intend to harm her - he just wanted to kill himself. He was initially charged with attempted murder but pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to the lesser charge of wounding with intent. A statement read to the court from Mrs Berry said: 'I have nerve damage to the stab wounds. My back is still the same and will never change. I can't bend, stretch, or pick up heavy things. 'I still get upset and cry and think what have I done to deserve this? I am scared to be on my own and have extra security. Bolton Crown Court sitting at Manchester Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard Berry married his wife in 1999 but was diagnosed with the debilitating neurological condition MS just a year later and his health deteriorated rapidly . 'I can no longer use knives and am told that I have suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I now have pre-cut groceries to help me. I can't watch the news or TV as this brings back memories.' On behalf of Berry, who was living in a nursing home before he was imprisoned, defence lawyer Tim Hopley said: 'The defendant talks of a mist or a lack of full comprehension over what he was doing. 'The defendant was capable of significantly more serious injuries than what was caused. 'In 2013 many factors came to a head which led to a mental disorder. MS is an invidious disease. It is always looming. 'That, combined with the breakdown of his marriage and the discovery of significant debts he was unaware of. 'It has become the view that his wife had reasons other than debts to get out of the marriage. There may have been another party involved. 'Depression is a common side effect of MS and bound to have a detrimental effect on his thinking process. He has little life left in terms of activity. 'His activities amount to watching TV and socialising with other residents in the home. He wishes to express his genuine and sincere remorse and regret for what he did. 'The divorce is towards its conclusion and that part of his life is over but he certainly had no desire to cause her the impact which it appears it has.' But Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'She is still suffering significant ongoing problems. She has psychological damage which manifests itself in a fear of seeing you or members of your family and she can't face using knives.' He added: 'You found the breakdown of the relationship impossible to deal with and made many efforts to contact her by phone and by attending her place of work. 'She began divorce proceedings and was seeking to organise the financial affairs and as a result, on October 15 you received a letter from the solicitor about financial matters and wrongly interpreted that - thinking she was trying to force the sale of the home but she was trying to register her interest in it. 'When you met her at the school there was no indication of any sort of what was to come. You said your intention was to kill yourself in front of her. It could easily have been so much worse.'","William Berry armed himself with knives before setting off on 5mph scooter .

"White supremacist Thomas Joseph Murphy and convicted killer Carmen Montelongo have both been sentenced to life, in more ways than one. Murphy, 46, from Crestline, California, was handed down a 248-year-to-life sentence last week in connection to a 2009 kidnapping, assault and battery case involving three women, dissuading a witness and animal cruelty. . Last Thursday, Murphy's attorney filed a motion asking a judge for a new trial because his client had been denied the right to represent himself. They found love in a hopeless place: Convicted kidnapper Thomas Murphy, 46 (left), proposed marriage to convicted murderer Carmen Montelongo (right), 54, whom he met aboard a jail bus . During the hearing, it was revealed that the 46-year-old self-proclaimed Neo-Nazi was engaged to Carmen Montelongo, 54, who was sentenced that same week to 26 years to life in the stabbing death and dismemberment of her boyfriend. Prosecutor Denise Yoakum suggested that the two jailbirds, who had never met before, likely fell in love on bus rides to and from court, The Alpenhorn News reported. . According to Murphy’s court records, in June 2009 he arrived at a home in Crestline looking for his estranged girlfriend. Believing that the people living in house were hiding the woman from him, Murphy forced his way inside and took the inhabitants hostage. The suspect then poured gasoline over his captives and threatened to set them alight. During the incident that lasted several hours, one of the female victims tried to escape ut was caught and beaten by Murphy with a hammer. Eventually one of the captives was able to get away and call for help, but by the time sheriff's deputies arrived Murphy had escaped. Hardened criminal: Murphy was sentenced to 248 years to life in a 2009 attack on three women, one of whom was beaten with a hammer . The kidnapper, who has Adolf Hitler's face and a swastika tattooed on his neck, was arrested the following day in Fullerton following a high-speed chase that involved several car collisions. During his trial, Murphy asked an attorney to take out an ad in a local newspaper that would name the victims in the 2009 attack in a bid to dissuade them from testifying against him, according to testimony. In court last week, Murphy apologized to his victims but also sounded a defiant note. ‘I’m heading to prison for the rest of my life and I’ll battle because I can’t be broken,’ he stated, according to Los Angeles Daily News . Murphy's violent behavior dates back to at least 1996, when he was charged with assault for hitting his then-girlfriend in the head with a telephone receiver until it split in half. While he was being held in jail in connection to the phone attack, Murphy allegedly hired a fellow inmate to kill his girlfriend and her young son, but the assassination plan never came to fruition. Murphy eventually pleaded guilty to charges of assault with a deadly weapon in exchange for having the murder solicitation charge dropped, and he was sentenced to eight years in prison. Thomas Murphy's bride-to-be has an equally dark past. Carmen Montelongo, of Riverside, was found guilty in late August of first-degree murder in connection to the grisly 2011 slaying of 62-year-old Samuel Wiggins. Blushing bride: Montelongo, 54, was sentenced in early October to 26 years to life in the 2011 murder and dismemberment of her boyfriend, Samuel Wiggins . Ms Montelongo, who also goes by the alias Montenegro, was arrested in late May 2011 after she was spotted wheeling a barrel in San Bernadino, California, reeking of decomposing flesh. Police officers who became suspicious of the malodorous container looked inside and found a man's torso and two legs mingled with soil. The rest of the victim’s remains, including the head, were discovered hidden inside two flower pots at a home in the Los Angeles suburb of Bell Gardens, NBC Los Angeles reported. Mr Wiggins was reported missing by his relatives in early May 2011 - about a month after he was last seen alive. According to the prosecutors, Montelongo killed him a short time later by stabbing her boyfriend twice in the chest and 22 times in the back. There is no word at this time when the two convicted felons will wed.","Thomas Murphy, 46, was sentenced to 248 years to life in 2009 attack on three women .

"Al Goldstein, the bird-flipping publisher of Screw magazine who helped break down legal barriers against pornography and raged against politicians, organized religion and anything that even suggested good taste, died today at a Brooklyn hospice. According to a friend, attorney Charles C. DeStefano, the controversial character passed away at the age of 77 after suffering from a long illness. Of all the would-be successors to Hugh Hefner's sexual throne, no one was as out there as Goldstein. Al Goldstein, Screw magazine publisher, attends the 25th anniversary party for New York's Le Cirque and Osteria del Circo restaurants in 1998. He died today after a long illness . Whether taking potshots at sacred cows in the magazine's pages, or placing an 11-foot-tall sculpture of an extended middle finger outside his Florida home, his angry humor, garish attire, numerous divorces and X-rated mind made him an infamous national figure. 'To be angry is to be alive. I'm an angry Jew. I love it. Anger is better than love. I think it is more pure,' he said in an interview in 2001. 'There's so much to be angry about, because people are ripped off, the election went to the wrong person, the good guys usually lose and society sucks.' To back that anger, Goldstein put his wallet where his mouth was, spending millions of dollars on First Amendment lawsuits, hundreds of thousands running unsuccessfully for sheriff in Florida, and millions more in numerous divorce settlements. DeStefano remembers Goldstein as an 'intellectual who cared about the world and geopolitics'. Al Goldstein, also known as the Prince of Porn, pictured in 1987 in his New York office. He was sent to prison several times for obscenity . But after a lavish lifestyle, Goldstein fell on difficult times, landing in a homeless shelter and a veterans hospital. 'Up until a month ago he still had that spark,' said DeStefano. 'In fact, he gave me the middle finger. As he did it, he smiled at me. I knew he was still Al Goldstein inside this shell of a body. I kissed him and held his hand. Many of his friends were like his sons. He had tremendous respect for friendships.' When he co-founded Screw in 1968, the American legal system was embroiled in a battle over what constitutes obscenity. Goldstein never envisioned himself as a champion of free speech, but fought for what he said were his own prurient interests. 'Screw grew from a combination of many factors, chief of which was my own dissatisfaction with the sex literature of 1968 and my yearning for a publication that reflected my sexual appetites,' he wrote in the 1971 Screw anthology. But Goldstein also felt that the cultural and religious establishment had convinced his generation that sex was dirty and turned them into 'a lot of embarrassed people who bought nudie magazines on the sly'. Publisher Al Goldstein and his longtime assistant Terre Galizio with a copy of Screw magazine in 2003 . The porn magazine's scathing, scatological editorials railed against religious leaders and the government for justifying war while imprisoning erotic magazine publishers. Screw sold 140,000 copies a week at its height. 'I may be making a lot of money, but I really believe I'm doing some good by demythologizing a lot about sexuality,' he told Playboy in 1974. Goldstein entertains a crowd of onlookers outside the 1980 Adult Entertainment Awards held at the Palladium in Hollywood . But the law was never far away. During the magazine's first three years, Goldstein was arrested 19 times on obscenity charges. Spending millions to defend himself, he ultimately scored a major victory in 1974 when a federal judge threw out an obscenity case brought against him. After that the willingness of the government to prosecute such cases waned, ending a period that saw books such as D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterly's Lover and Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer banned and kept erotic publications under the counter. But the victory left Goldstein feeling flat. 'I really need the attention of being arrested, because that means I'm still bugging the establishment, that I'm still gadfly to the state,' he told Playboy. 'Acceptance of me and Screw would be the kiss of death.' And it may have been the magazine's undoing, as it was soon eclipsed by more explicit publications, like Larry Flynt's Hustler magazine. Goldstein soon found other outlets, and in 1974 launched a sex-oriented cable porn show, ""Midnight Blue,"" which ran for nearly 30 years. As the poignancy of Screw faded, Goldstein became depressed and angrier. In 2002, he was sentenced after a wild trial to 60 days in jail for harassing a former secretary with threatening phone calls and editorials. The conviction was later overturned when an appeals court ruled prosecutors had used overly inflammatory language at trial. A year later Goldstein pleaded guilty to harassing one of his four ex-wives with obscene phone messages. In late 2003, the magazine folded and . Goldstein filed for bankruptcy protection. On the upside, he lost 150 . pounds following stomach stapling surgery the same year and married his . fifth wife, a woman 40 years his junior. Things . fell so far, though, that in 2004 he told The New York Times he was . forced, at times, to sleep in a car and live in a Florida homeless . shelter. 'Anyone who wishes ill on me should feel vindicated because my life has turned into a total horror,' he told the Times. He is survived by his wife, Christine, and a son, Jordan.

Suzy Kolbert, an ESPN sportscaster who worked with Scott for years, said: 'No matter how big he got, now matter how bad it got, he never changed. He loved his work, he loved his daughters, he loved being Stu.' In action: Scott, pictured in 2002, was one of the first African Americans to be a prominent sports presenter .

Ray and Jacqueline Scott; siblings Stephen Scott, Synthia Kearney and Susan Scott; his daughters Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15; and girlfriend Kristin Spodobalski. As he accepted the award named for former N.C. State coach Jim Valvano, who died of cancer in 1993, Scott noted: 'When you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer.

"A couple who failed to seek medical care for their cancer-stricken son because they said they couldn't afford medical care have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Willie Robinson, eight, died of Hodgkin's . Lymphoma in 2008 after begging his parents to get him medical . care, according to prosecutors. They say that had he received treatment, the youngster would . have had a 96 percent chance of making a full recovery. Monica Hussing and William Robinson Sr. claim they never took their cancer-stricken son Willie to the doctor because they didn't have the money. Scroll down for video . Neglect: Monica Hussing, 37, and William Robinson, 40, admitted that they did not take their cancer-stricken son to the doctor despite his begging . But somehow, the parents found the cash to have their family pit bull treated for fleas, prosecutors say. Hussing, 37, and Robinson, 40, have been free on $150,000 bail each in Cleveland, Ohio, since their son died. On Monday, the parents pleaded guilty to attempted involuntary manslaughter and face up to eight years in prison. Hussing's lawyer blamed Willie's death . on the fact that the parents, who still have five children, were poor and . did not have health insurance. 'Unfortunately, these people did not have that ability to get the proper health care and I think the entire system both in Warren, in Trumbull County and in Cuyahoga County it was just a little bit of... the ball was dropped,' John Luskin told WJW.

After ignoring . his pleas for medical help, Willie collapsed at their home March 22, . 2008. It was then Hussing and Robinson finally took him to the hospital, . where he was diagnosed with cancer and died later that day. The coroner ruled his death, caused by cancer and pneumonia, a homicide, meaning it was the result of his parents' actions. Authorities say none of the couple's five other children, now 17, 16, 10, 9 and 8, received medical care. All of them have been removed from their parents and are living with an aunt. The parents also kept their children out of school. Willie never saw a the inside of a classroom in his short life, authorities say.

"A teenager who was allegedly starved and mistreated by his parents for four years has put on 10 pounds in just a week following his rescue. Mitch Comer, from Georgia, was found wandering around a Los Angeles bus station looking emaciated and much younger than his 18 years. The pale and gaunt boy told police that his stepfather Paul had given him $200 and put him on a bus to California on September 8, a day after his 18th birthday, telling him he was now a man. Scroll down for video . In jail: Paul and Sheila Marie Comer are awaiting bond hearings after allegedly starving and maltreating 18-year-old Mitch, who was found wandering around a bus station more than 2,000 miles from home . Mr Comer and the boy's mother Sheila Marie were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment on September 12, at their home near Dallas. They are being held in Paulding . County jail and have bond hearings scheduled for 9am on Thursday at the . Paulding County courthouse, according to the Atlanta . Journal-Constitution. Mitch meanwhile, who weighed just 87 pounds and whose skin was practically translucent when he was found, is said to be 'doing well'. As an 18-year-old, he was not eligible for foster care, but has been taken in by a local family, detectives said. He did not know his own address, but his parents . were quickly tracked down. The couple’s two daughters have been in protective custody since their parents were arrested, investigators said. 'Abuse': Mitch told detectives he was forced to stand against the wall at the family home near Dallas, Georgia, for up to eight hours at a time . The Comers have no prior criminal . history, but were the subject of a 2009 investigation by local . authorities following an abuse allegation when the family lived in . Cherokee County. The case was referred to the Cherokee Sheriff’s Office, but was later closed, and no charges were filed. Retired Los Angeles police Sgt. Joe Gonzalez spotted Mitch at a downtown bus station on September 11, and could not believe the stunted and gaunt teenager was more than 12 or 13 years old. The teenager told detectives that his stepfather had driven him to a bus station in Jackson, Mississippi on his 18th birthday and given him the cash, along with a list of homeless shelters. Mitch told the police that he had suffered years of abuse after being taken out of school in the eighth grade. Detectives said the 18-year-old boy had practically translucent skin and looked no more than 12 or 13 years old. Pictured, police searching the family home . He said he was locked in a bedroom and fed tiny quantities of food. He was forced to stand on his toes against a wall with his fingers interlaced behind his head for eight hours every day. The boy was kept in such seclusion that his two younger sisters in the same house did not know what he looked like, the authorities revealed. 'The sisters haven't seen the brother in over two years,' said Paulding's Cpl. Ashley Henson. 'They didn't even know what colour his hair was.' Neighbours on the quiet cul-de-sac of two-storey brick and vinyl siding homes, about 30 miles outside Atlanta, said the couple kept to themselves and were shocked to discover that the family had a son. The FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation have joined the case, Cpl. Henson added. Horrifying: Comer, who was found in a Californian bus depot weighing just 97 pounds, told authorities he spent the last four years locked in a room at his parents' Georgia home, pictured. Neighbours were surprised to learn that the family had a son as they'd never seen him . Mrs Comer’s mother, Diana Powell, of Iowa, said she hadn’t spoken to her daughter in more than a decade and hadn’t seen her grandson since he was a toddler. Powell told the station that she had feared her daughter and husband abused their children but had no direct evidence. 'They mistreated him something terrible. I got on her case about it and she disappeared from my life,’ she said crying. Authorities say that they are just at . the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with the case and more charges could be . brought against the parents. Monica Moore, an investigator with the Paulding County District Attorney’s office, described the 18-year-old victim as small, very timid, and extremely polite. Moore confirmed that a local family had agreed to house the teenager, according to Channel 2. A spokesman from Paulding County Public Schools could also not confirm whether the children have ever been enrolled in the school system. State and local officials prepare to search Paul and Shelia Comer's Dallas home . Records show the Comers have lived in almost two dozen different homes during the past two decades. Neighbours said the family had lived at their large Dallas home for at least a few years. Neighbours Dion Walker and Mea Smith told AJC that their children had played with the Comers’ daughters over the years but that they had never even seen Mitch. They said they were surprised to learn the family had a son. 'Maybe, when the young girls would stare at us, were they trying to say something?' said Mr Walker. 'Should we have noticed?' Mitch was flown back to Dallas on Wednesday to participate in the investigation and legal proceedings. His stepfather had his own business repairing home appliances, said next-door neighbour John White. They rarely spoke. Mrs Comer never left the house unless she was with her husband, . not even to check the mail, said Mr White. Their two daughters would . sometimes come outside and play, but only in the back yard. Neighbours . assumed the girls didn't go to school either – they never caught the bus . that picked up other children in the cul-de-sac every morning. Neighbors said they had no clue the Comers had a son until a detective came knocking at their doors asking questions last week. 'I had no idea, no clue. There were no signs of a son at all,' said Mr Walker, who has lived next to the Comers for two years. 'The few . occasions we would see them go to the van, it was always the parents and . the two girls.' Walker said police swarmed the Comers' home last week, arresting the parents and taking both girls into protective custody. Walker said the Comer family did not take part in neighbourhood . association meetings and their girls never attended the neighbourhood . Halloween block parties.

"A four-month-old baby suffered horrific injuries including six broken bones at the hands of his mother and father who battered him with cutlery and a flex cord, a court heard today. Doctors found Ethan Sheldon had three broken ribs, a shattered collarbone, a fractured ankle, a broken toe and more than 20 bruises when he was examined in October 2010. His father Christopher Sheldon, 32, and mother Charlotte, 24, have denied causing the injuries at Plymouth Crown Court. Experts told the court that the baby must have been hit with blunt objects and had his legs twisted and squeezed during the first four months of his life. Accused: Christopher Sheldon, left, and Charlotte Sheldon beat their son Ethan with blunt objects which could have been cutlery or a flex cord, Plymouth Crown Court, right, has heard . Jo Martin, prosecuting, said doctors . concluded than Ethan suffered at least three or four 'incidences of . violence' at the hands of one or both of the defendants. She said: 'There is no suggestion that . the broken bones and the bruises which Ethan undoubtedly suffered were . caused by anything other than an assault or assaults upon him. 'There is no doubt Ethan was hit three or four times by one or both of the defendants with some sort of object.' Miss Martin said a doctor had . concluded the pattern of bruising showed he had been struck with a 'long . and straight object or with a flat object with raised edges.' One expert suggested he could have been hit by a blunt cutlery piece. Miss Martin said Ethan may also have been struck with an electric flex cord because the bruises 'followed the curvature of the limbs'. She added the ribs and collarbone were . mostly likely broken by squeezing with 'considerable force well in . excess of everyday handling'. The child's ankle or tibia could have been . fractured by holding and twisting of the foot while his toe may have . been broken by a heavy object being dropped on it. The court heard the injuries would . have left Ethan crying in pain for 'two to three days'. The abuse was discovered after a health worker visited the home on October 5, 2010, and was concerned that Ethan was not putting on weight, the court heard. His parents could offer no explanation for the injuries and the child was referred to a doctor who immediately referred him to hospital for X-rays. Miss Martin said both defendants accepted the injuries were non-accidental and nobody else could have caused them but both have denied causing the injuries or even knowing about them. Christopher Sheldon, of Totnes, Devon, and Charlotte Sheldon, of Plymouth, are both of accused of 'ill-treating or assaulting' Ethan between his birth in May 2010 and October 2010.

"A four-month-old baby was starved to death by his parents as his mother repeatedly lied about taking him to see doctors, a jury has found. Amy R. Hockett, 22, was found guilty of murder in the death of Khaiden Hockett, while Joseph L. Pierson, 25, was found guilty of reckless homicide, as he was ruled to be 'mildly mentally retarded'. Khaiden was found unresponsive inside the couple's filthy, feces-ridden home in Richmond, Indiana on February 5, 2012, weighing just six pounds. The case was ruled a homicide, with the cause of death cited as dehydration because of starvation. Guilty: Amy Hockett, left, and Joseph L. Pierson, right, starved their four-month-old son to death as Hockett claimed she was taking the tiny baby to doctors for tests for a range of diseases . His death came despite Hockett claiming doctors were testing her son for diseases including leukemia, blood disorders and kidney stones, and less serious . problems, such as acid reflux. Pierson's attorneys claimed through the trial that she had also lied to him about the baby's medical care, and that he believed the young boy was receiving attention, the Palladium-Item reported. His attorneys said expert testimony showed that Pierson was likely to take the facts at face value and did not have the cognitive abilities to investigate the matter for himself. Khaiden had been born a healthy 8 pounds, 7 ounces in October 2011, and had just one visit to the doctor a week after his birth. After the visit, he began slowly dying, prosecutors said. A video showed to the courtroom revealed piles of clothing, overflowing trash cans, dirty dishes, rotting food and feces littered throughout the couple's home. Khaiden was forced to sleep in a . swing that was soaked with his urine; jurors were shown pictures of the . swing pad covered in yellow and brown stains. Loss: Khaiden was found unresponsive at their home weighing just 6 lbs. He was born weighing 8lbs 7oz . Victim: The baby boy was forced to sleep in a urine-soaked swing at the couple's filthy home . Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Shipman . said the couple did not give the baby food, bathe him or change his . diapers, and he quickly lost weight. When other relatives inquired about his health, Hockett said she had taken him for tests. 'He died because the people who were . supposed to care the most for him didn't,' Shipman said. 'Nobody was there when this . little guy died alone in the back room of the house.' Pierson's attorney, Michael Dean, . argued that the boy died from a lack of medical attention, rather than . starvation, and that his client had been duped to believe he was . receiving such care. 'The entire web of lies started with . family members... all people with more intelligence than Joseph . Pierson,' he said. 'They were able to assess the situation better than . Joseph Pierson, and they all bought it.' Hockett was found guilty of murder, . neglect of a dependent resulting in death and neglect of a dependent. Pierson was found guilty but mentally ill of reckless homicide, neglect . of a dependent resulting in death and neglect of a dependent. Scene: The jury saw images from inside the home, pictured, showing trash, rotting food and feces . Expert witnesses said that while Pierson . was mildly mentally retarded, he did not meet the state's criteria for . being considered insane at the time of the death. Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Shipman told the Indy Star that he was not surprised by the decision. 'Based on the evidence, I can see . where the jury would see Amy Hockett being more responsible for . Khaiden's death,' he said. 'He is mildly mentally handicapped, and I . think that made a difference in what the jury felt.' Hockett faces 45 to 65 years in prison for murder and 20 to 50 years in prison for neglect of a dependent resulting in death, while Pierson faces 20 to 50 years for neglect of a dependent resulting in death and two to eight years in prison for reckless homicide. They could be served concurrently. They will be sentenced on March 7.","Khaiden Hockett was found unresponsive at his home in February 2012 .

"Tracked down: Robert Bill, 59, has been jailed for 20 years after attacking underage girls in Morocco . A British former teacher and playground designer was today sentenced to 20 years in prison for kidnapping and attempting to rape three young girls in Morocco. Robert Bill, 59, from St Asaph, in Wales, has been jailed in the northern city of Tetouan, after being arrested in June 2013. He was taken into custody after locals heard the cries of a six-year-old girl from his car in a parking garage. Bill, who has previous convictions in Britain, was accused of luring children into his Spain-registered vehicle in order to attack them. A six-year-old girl was found in the car by a group of adults who surrounded the car, and called the police. Bill was also found guilty of kidnapping and attempting to rape another two Moroccan girls prior to his arrest - one in Tetouan and one in the nearby town of Chefchaouen. Former victims looked on as he was led away from a criminal court in Tetouan late on Tuesday, when he was sentenced. Mohammed Benaissa, of the Northern Observatory for Human Rights, told France's news agency AFP: 'We welcome this ruling, because it protects the children and it sends a warning to paedophiles.' Bill, who was also fined the equivalent of some £6,000 pounds, denied all the charges, and has en days to appeal the verdict. He worked as a teacher in Wales, and later ran a playground design business before being arrested in the UK. In March 2009 he was imprisoned for six years following a trial at Caernarfon Crown Court for the attempted abduction of a five year-old girl in Holywell, Flintshire, in 2007. Bill later appealed and after . pleading guilty before a retrial, was then sentenced to a two year . prison term at Chester Crown Court in 2010. During his trials in Britain, Bill was described by a judge as a 'sexual predator'. Running away: Bill fled Britain for Costa del Sol, Malaga (pictured) after he served time in the UK, before he reappeared in Morocco last year . After leaving prison he travelled to southern Spain where he rented a two-bed cottage in a remote mountain hamlet an hour's drive from Malaga after jetting to Spain - and later got an office job at an estate agent's on the coast. Locals told how he drove a Peugeot 106 with a 'baby on board' sticker in the back window despite not having a young child. He disappeared after telling expats he befriended at a pub he had to return to Britain for emergency treatment for a throat problem. Days later Spanish police revealed they were hunting him after obtaining CCTV footage of him bundling a 12-year-old Romanian youngster into his car. The schoolgirl only escaped the sex pervert's clutches after escaping through an unlocked door before he sped off with her. Bill, a Jehovah's Witness, was convicted in March 2009 of trying to abduct a five-year-old girl as he cruised around a council estate in Holywell, Wrexham in June 2007. He was also found guilty of downloading child porn on his computer and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl. He appealed against his conviction - but changed his plea to guilty shortly before a retrial and admitted breaching a Sex Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) by viewing videos of children on YouTube while on bail.

"Furious: Mr Timothy Coupe (pictured) swore at traffic warden, Amy Harrison, and shot her with a water pistol after she issued him a parking ticket . A furious businessman unleashed a foul-mouthed tirade at the female traffic warden who gave him a parking ticket, before squirting her with a water pistol. Timothy Coupe 'humiliated' civil enforcement officer, Amy Harrison, by pulling out a toy gun and shooting water at her face and chest - causing the shirt she was wearing to go see-through. The furious 53-year-old reacted to a £25 fine he'd received from Miss Harrison for parking illegally by a Boots pharmacy on Compston Road in Ambleside, Cumbria. His Land Rover was parked in a loading bay near the store on June 18, when he was approached by the on-duty Harrison. When she told him that he couldn't park there, he rudely put his finger to his mouth and gestured at her to 'shush', Kendal Magistrates Court heard. Miss Harrison walked towards the front of his car to take down the registration number when Coupe shouted at her: 'What the fu** are you doing? I'm not f****** accepting that.' When Miss Harrison told him to expect his penalty in the post, he continued: 'Do you look in the mirror when you get ready? 'Get a proper f****** job... You're an ugly f****** c**t.' A tearful Amy Harrison then described to the court how he pulled out the water pistol and squirted it at her. She said: 'He pointed a water pistol at me and squirted it in my face and on my shirt. 'It was humiliating and embarrassing. I can't tell you how distressing it is to have a grown man shout those words at you. 'I was wearing a white shirt and it went see through in the middle of Ambleside.' Coupe, of Clappersgate, Cumbria, denied using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, harm or distress. He dismissed Miss Harrison's account as 'fiction'. When asked why she would make the story up, he replied: 'Maybe she felt undermined by me in my big posh Land Rover.' Embarrassing: Miss Harrison said she was left 'humiliated' when Mr Coupe shot water at her face and chest near a Boots pharmacy in Ambleside, Cumbria (pictured) Coupe claimed he had the water pistol to reprimand his Newfoundland puppy, who would bark loudly when people approached his car. He described himself as a 'gentleman who attended a public school' and insisted the only time he's picked up the toy pistol was to squirt his dog. But magistrates found the business director guilty and ordered him to pay a £1,000 fine and £400 in compensation, along with court costs and a victim surcharge. Suzie Kavanagh, for Coupe, said: 'He is a man of good character and has no previous convictions. 'He is recently divorced and is currently in a poor financial situation. He currently earns around £18,800 per annum.' An unsympathetic Magistrate, Ann Howson, told Mr Coupe: 'There was no reduction of the fine because of a not guilty plea, and you have the means to pay this within 28 days. 'Miss Harrison was a credible witness whose recollection of the incident, even today, caused distress.'","Timothy Coupe, 53, shot water at her face and chest after receiving ticket .

"Pensioner John Bidmead was jailed for 19 years for abusing young girls and having thousands of indecent images on his computer . A pensioner who was caught with more than a million pornographic images of children was jailed for 19 years today after admitting abusing young girls . John Bidmead, 65, a lorry driver, was watching a video of child abuse when police knocked on his front door with a warrant to arrest him. When police searched his property, huge amounts of indecent material was found on his computers. Officers, who said they stopped counting when they reached 640,000, believe he had more than a million indecent images in his possession. Exeter Crown Court heard the haul included films Bidmead had made of himself raping and abusing two young girls. He also groomed two other girls and would pay one of them - aged just eight - money to pose for him indecently. Bidmead of Cullompton, Devon admitted four rapes and four indecent or sexual assaults on one girl and two sexual assaults on a second. The offences took place between 2001 and 2007. He also pleaded guilty to 11 offences of taking indecent photographs and movies and eight of making indecent photographs or movies, including including roll up counts totalling 640,738 films or photographs. These included more than 24,000 at the two highest levels which show adults abusing children. Richard Crabb, prosecuting, told the court that Bidmead was arrested when police received a tip-off from the Russian authorities that he had been accessing a file-sharing website to download child pornography. 'Of the first things the police officers noticed was a 50 inch TV monitor which showed that images of child abuse were being downloaded when they arrived,' he said. 'A total of 40 items were found, including a number of computers and the defendant was arrested for possession of indecent images. On his arrest, he replied ‘bang to rights’. 'He admitted downloading child abuse material for the last 10 years and said he didn’t know why he did it.' Mr Crabb said Bidmead was released on bail pending the forensic examination of his computers, which revealed he had sexually abused two young girls, aged between eight and 10, and filmed it. 'There was too much material to examine all of it. There was simply not the resources available to go through all the material and the decision was made to prioritise,' Mr Crabb said. 'But estimates of a total exceed one million. It is the largest amount in this part of the country as far as we are aware of. 'The police officers involved in this inquiry have carried out a great deal of work in relation to the sheer scale of it.' Exeter Crown Court (pictured) heard how police found films Bidmead had made of himself raping two girls . Mr Crabb said that Bidmead had not shared any of the material he had filmed himself but when confronted with it by detectives told them: 'I don’t want to see or hear it. I am guilty of everything shown on those videos.' The court heard that Bidmead had written a letter to the judge which acknowledged the shame he had brought upon his family but did not ask for clemency. Sean Brunton, defending, said: 'He entirely accepts that he has betrayed all his family and his friends and in particular the victims of his own offending. 'He told the probation officer that what he had done was shameful and he expects to die in prison. He said he deserves whatever punishment he is given. 'He expresses to your honour, to the probation officer and to the psychiatrist deep regret and shame - powerless to do anything about what he has done by way of rectification. 'On behalf of the defendant I invite your honour to impose a sentence that both he and his victims would like and expect, which is a very long sentence in custody to represent that he has destroyed the lives of several people and in the process destroyed his own life.' Judge Phillip Wassall . Passing sentence, Judge Phillip Wassall said the details of the case were 'quite appalling' and described the police investigation as 'exhaustive and debilitating'. He told Bidmead: 'The magnitude is quite staggering. You had more than a million images of children being abused, including significantly high numbers of images of the worst type of abuse. 'That was only a fraction because an analysis of your computer showed images of you raping and abusing a child. 'The impact upon the victims is considerable. All though you cannot recall it, the images tell their own story and provide the most graphic and appalling evidence of what you had done.' Bidmead was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for life, made subject of a sexual offences prevention order and ordered that his computer equipment and indecent collection be destroyed. The judge praised the officers involved in bringing Bidmead to justice. 'This case involved the police looking at so much material and having to do so much work and I think it drives me to say that the officers involved should be commended,' the judge said. Detective Inspector Andrea Kingdon, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said after the hearing: 'This has been a very distressing and sensitive investigation, particularly for the victims of this abuse. 'There is no doubt that Bidmead is a predatory child sex offender who has committed a number of extremely serious sex offences against children.'","John Bidmead, 65, was watching a video of child abuse as he was arrested .

"Rapist: Michael Warrener was jailed for 19 years for repeatedly raping his daughter . A father who repeatedly raped his daughter has been jailed for 19 years and told he is to blame for her suicide. Tragic Claire Warrener killed herself last December when she was barely into her 20s - just months after breaking her silence about the horrific ordeal her dad had put her through when she was a young girl. Just before she killed herself, Claire sent a text to a loved one saying she could not cope because of what her dad Michael Warrener had done to her. Warrener, of Twickenham Road, Sunderland, denied one charge of indecent assault and three of rape but was found guilty by a jury after a trial at Newcastle Crown Court last week. The lengthy, harrowing statement Claire made when she reported her horrendous experience to the police was used as evidence against her father during the trial. Her grieving family were in court to see the 59-year-old finally face justice for his sickening crimes and said 'we hope he rots in hell.' Judge John Milford told Warrener: 'I am satisfied you are, at least in part, responsible for her death. 'She had made a victim impact statement speaking of the considerable impact the offences had made upon her. 'Though other factors may have played a part in the decision she took to end her life, she sent a text saying she could not cope any longer because of what you had done to her. 'This was a gross breach of trust causing great harm. You have demonstrated no remorse.' Warrener appeared defiant and shook his head during the proceedings yesterday. Speaking after the hearing, Claire’s devastated family said: 'The most important part of all this is we got justice for Claire. We hope he rots in hell. 'We have always said Claire did what she did because of the abuse he put her through, now the judge has publicly said that that was in fact one of the reasons for her taking her own life. 'Even though 19 years sounds like a long time, for us, no sentence could be long enough. 'As a family we have got a life sentence because of what he did, we will never get Claire back even after he has served the 19 years.' The court had heard how Warrener repeatedly abused Claire from the age of around 13. Repeated abuse: Newcastle Crown Court, where Warrener was told he was partly to blame for daughter Claire's suicide . Prosecutor Penny Moreland told the court how Claire, whose parents had split up, was living with her dad when the abuse started. Miss Moreland said: 'He came to her bedroom when she was asleep.' Claire told police in her statement: 'I didn’t know what had happened to me.' After the first incident of abuse, which happened when Warrener’s then girlfriend had walked out on him, Claire’s ordeal got worse. Miss Moreland said: 'The defendant again came into Claire’s bedroom at night. That night he raped her. 'After that he raped her more often, as the problems in his relationship became greater, until he was having sex with her about three or four times per week.' The court heard it wasn’t until 2010 Claire felt able to report her dad for what he had done. Miss Moreland said: 'She told the police and on March 13 she made her statement.' Warrener was arrested and denied wrongdoing. Miss Moreland said: 'He said she might be making the allegation up because he had accused her three weeks earlier of stealing money from him.' Warrener was found guilty of indecent assaults on two other child victims during the trial.","Michael Warrener is locked up on three rape charges and one of indecent assault .

"A man arrested by detectives trying to discover the fate of schoolgirl Alice Gross was released from custody last night. The 51-year-old man was told he will face no further action over the disappearance of the troubled 14-year-old. A second suspect, an unconnected 25-year-old man, who was held after a tip-off at the weekend, remained in custody. Scroll down for video . Alice Gross (above), 14, went missing almost two weeks ago and her backpack was found by the canal in Hanwell, West London, last Thursday . The disappearance of Alice almost two weeks ago continues to baffle a team of Scotland Yard’s top investigators. They insist they are conducting a missing person inquiry but have thrown the resources of a full murder investigation at the mystery. Their focus remains a half-mile stretch of canal a short distance from her home in Hanwell, West London, where she was last seen. A team of frogmen have sealed off a half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal which has murky, litter strewn waters around 2m deep. The centre of the search is close to where the canal joins the River Brent and where Alice’s rucksack was discovered last Thursday. Police declined to reveal whether they have traced her treasured iPhone yesterday, but it is understood the device has been switched off. A team of frogmen have sealed off a half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal which has murky, litter strewn waters around 2m deep . Specialist forensic officers have also conducted searches at two homes linked to the 51-year-old suspect.

"Andrew Cunningham, 50, died from multiple stab wounds to his head, neck and chest, and was found in a pool of blood in Wandsworth, south London, in December 2008 . A paedophile who was hacked to death in a frenzied assault by a suspected mob of vigilantes had been seen 'entertaining' young girls in his caravan the night before he was murdered, an inquest heard today. Andrew Cunningham, 52, was found naked and soaked in blood at his caravan home after suffering multiple stab wounds and mutilation to his genitals - but four years after the 2008 killing no-one has ever been charged. It was revealed at an inquest into his death today that a local pub he used to drink in had turned the CCTV off on the night of death - but claim it was an 'accident'. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe today ruled he was unlawfully killed. The police investigation is ongoing. Cunningham . served four months in jail in 2000 for having sex with a 15-year-old . girl and was on the Sex Offenders' Register until March 2008. He . had been attacked by vigilantes before who had set fire to a bag of . rubbish outside his former house in Wandsworth in 2003 after he was . arrested and released without charge over allegations he was grooming . children. In the run up to his death it was rumoured he had molested a two-year-old. The . allegation was never reported and sources say the claims were . 'unfounded'. He had a further conviction for common assault in 2006. One of the last times he was seen, Cunningham was with three youngsters. Detective Inspector . Alison Hepworth, who lead the investigation, said: 'We know he had . girls in his caravan. Three girls were present on the Monday of that . week, the 8th December, at about 4.30pm. 'He was seen with the girls in his . caravan, young girls about 13 or 14, this was the day before he died, he . had been entertaining the girls in his caravan.' She . added: 'They used to go round there after school and he would provide . them with alcohol. They made no allegations of a sexual nature against . him.' The next night he was . hacked to death in the same caravan. Because of mutilations to his . genitals police believed it was linked to his lust for youngsters. DI . Hepworth said: 'We know a bit about this man, we know that people . locally knew he had a previous for sexual offences, we had a lot of . enquiries to follow. ' Cunningham, a father-of-five separated . from his partner, worked as a truck driver for the Riverside Haulage . company and also lived in his caravan on the site in Wandsworth, south . London. The depot where murdered Andrew Cunningham lived and worked. He was allegedly killed by a gang, because he was a paedophile, but four years on no-one has been charged . The man's body was found by his boss after he failed to start work in the yard where he also lived . On December 10, 2008, his boss, Rodney Artiss, noticed that he had not opened up the yard as usual and went to his caravan to find him. DI Hepworth said: 'He found the caravan door open which was unusual, it normally would be locked and he wouldn’t let anyone he didn’t know in. 'He went in and saw Mr Cunningham lying on his bed on his right hand side and there was blood all around him.' Four of his daughters attended Westminster Coroner's Court today and one wept as the evidence was read out. The tiny caravan had been ransacked with the cupboards above the bed emptied out. DI Hepworth said: 'There was stuff everywhere, it was obvious it had been searched.' Paramedics then cops rushed to the scene and it was forensically searched. 'He had multiple stab wound which were obvious to anyone who came in.' 'He was seen with the girls in his . caravan, young girls about 13 or 14, this was the day before he died, he . had been entertaining the girls in his caravan.' DI Alison Hepworth . A post-mortem examination revealed he had a 'considerable number of stab wounds' which had killed him including multiple stabs to the back and side of the neck and the chest. He had a number of superficial injuries to his arms and body and mutilated genitals. The officer agreed when Dr Radcliffe asked: 'The mutilation would lead you to suspect it was related in some way to people who had previous knowledge of his offences.' DI Hepworth told the court that the police had interviewed more than 800 people and offered a £20,000 reward but no-one had been caught. She said: 'We have had people put forward as people who might be responsible and we have arrested three people and all of them have been eliminated either because you can’t forensically link then to the scene or they have provided alibis.' The area is 'massively covered' by CCTV but no trace of the killers has been found. DI Hepworth said: 'What is significant to me is the Corner Pin public house had turned their CCTV off on the night of the murder. 'They turned it off at 4pm and it started again the next day. They say that it is an accident, who’s to know.' Cunningham used to drink in the pub but had not been in there for some time before his death, the court heard. Four traces of unknown DNA and fingerprints which have never been identified were found at the scene. They are subject to continual forensic review and searches against new arrests. Because of the tiny space in the caravan forensic testing is difficult as Cunningham's DNA 'swamped' the area, the court heard. Cunningham’s sister, Sarah-Jane, who ran from the court in floods of tears as the verdict was announced. Dr Radcliffe recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. She said: 'It is quite clearly a frenzied attack with multiple stab wounds and mutilation of the body. 'The file will remain open with police and they will review the forensic evidence on a regular basis and we are all aware of advances in forensic technology that allow deaths to be solved some years after they have occurred and we can only hope for the family’s sake that something will come up in the future.' The family refused to comment as they left court.","Andrew Cunningham, 52, was found naked and soaked in blood at his caravan home in Wandsworth, south London .

"A Chicago man has been arrested for abusing his wife after she was found starved, blind and covered in four-inch wide bedsores. Mary Jane Duffy, 60, was discovered alone and suffering by police on August 23, 2011, at the Brookfield, Illinois, home she shared with her husband. Weighing just 56 pounds, the frail 4-foot-11 woman was in the foetal position, covered in ulcers and had severe bruising, fractured bones and missing teeth. Ailing: Mary Jane Duffy, pictured, died just a week after being found weighing just 56 pounds on August 23, 2011 . Her toenails were long and dirty, she was blind and in the last stages of dementia, according to Cook County sheriff's office. She was rushed to Holy Cross Hospital in Chicago where she died a week later on September 1. The woman's husband, Joseph Duffy, 70, was . arrested on Wednesday and charged with two counts of criminal abuse or neglect of a person . with a disability. He faces up to seven years in prison. When the woman was wheeled out of the . home, Mr Duffy told officers that he didn't want her to leave the house . because he would 'lose money', referring to his wife's social security . and pension payments. Healthy: Ms Duffy, pictured in 2000, died of 'spousal neglect' according to Cook County medical examiner's office . Fading away: Hospital and nursing home staff repeatedly warned that Ms Duffy, pictured in 2009, was suffering abuse at the hands of her husband . Mr Duffy was pocketing $3,000 in . benefits every month, which included a disability pension from his . wife's former employer Con Edison, according to the sheriff's office. 'We have not seen any indication of remorse,' Sheriff Thomas Dart said. According to the Cook County medical . examiner's office, Ms Duffy died of bronchopneumonia and 'spousal . neglect'. The office ruled the death a homicide. Abuse: Joseph Duffy, pictured, was charged with felony criminal abuse of a person with a disability, his 60-year-old wife, Mary Jane . The woman also had an underlying . condition called congenital hydrocephalus, or fluid on the brain at . birth, which contributed to her death, the office's report said. Mr Dart told MailOnline that his office had been pushing for murder charges and was disappointed Mr Duffy had only been charged with abuse. 'As far as elder abuse goes, this is the worst case our office has ever handled,' he said. Between 2006 and 2011, Ms Duffy was treated for dementia and other ailments. Staff at hospitals, . nursing homes and home-care agencies had repeatedly told authorities . they feared the woman was being abused by her husband. One healthcare company stopped . treating the woman after Mr Duffy refused to let a nurse into his home . because of her ethnicity, the Chicago Sun Times reported. A hospice company visiting the . couple's home to assess Ms Duffy for a home-care program first . discovered the woman covered in ulcers and unable to speak. Staff then . tipped off police. 'Numerous people came into contact . with the victim and one after another they tried to get the defendant to . do basic things to care for her but he refused and prevented her from . getting the help she needed,' Mr Dart said. Crime scene: Police were tipped off by healthcare workers that Ms Duffy was being abused at the Brookfield apartment, pictured . 'Workers regularly heard the man saying things like 'I wish you would die' and 'why don't you just drop . dead'. Who knows how he treated her when the workers weren't there. 'He . did nothing to help her and did all sorts of things that contributed to . her death.' Mr Dart said Mr Duffy lived a comfortable life on his wife's social security and pension payments. 'Workers pointed out that the woman was sleeping in a cot covered in her own waste,' he said. 'Meanwhile, he was sleeping in the master bedroom as comfortable as can be.'","Joseph Duffy, 70, told police he wouldn't let his wife, Mary Jane, 60, go into care because he'd lose her $3,000-a-month social security payments .

"A father has gone on trial for allegedly beating and starving his three-year-old daughter to death - three years after her bruised, malnourished body was found at his home. Donald Lee Cockrell, 30, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Alexis Marie Pounder with his fiancee, Michelle Nicole Smith, in Sandy, Oregon in January 2010. Smith pleaded guilty to the killing last year and faces a minimum of 30 years behind bars, and as part of the plea deal she will testify against Cockrell. Alexis, who was known as Lexi, weighed . just 21 pounds when paramedics found her beaten body at the . garbage-filled home she shared with Cockrell, Smith and four other . children under five. In court: Donald Cockrell is pictured at his trial for the murder of his three-year-old daughter in 2010 . Investigators said it was one of the worst cases they have ever seen. The young girl, who had lived at the home since October 2009, was incontinent and was repeatedly punished for soiling herself, The Oregonian reported. If . the family went out to a fast-food restaurant, she was the only one who . would go without a meal, and would be forced to sleep on the floor or . to run as punishment, the paper reported. An autopsy found that she suffered a blunt force head trauma and the report detailed scores of injuries to her little body, prosecutor Christine Landers told the jury in Cockrell's trial. When a detective asked Cockrell what had happened to his daughter, he simply said: 'I woke . up and found my daughter dead', Landers said. Tragic: Alexis Pounder, who was known as Lexi, was found malnourished and bruised in January 2010 . Innocent: She was allegedly punished as she suffered from incontinence and would soil herself . Lexi was not the only child who suffered abuse at the rural home. Her sister Kara was also forced to scavenge the dirty kitchen floor and garbage for food, and was forced to sleep in a tiny space between the wall and a couch from which she could not escape. The girls lived with Cockrell and his fiancee, who also had two children of . her own who lived at the home. The couple also had a child together. At the start of the trial on . Wednesday, the jurors were shown pictures of Lexi as a smiling child and . also photographs of her bruised, lifeless body. Cockrell is charged with aggravated murder, murder by abuse and criminal mistreatment related to the death. Loss: The family would allegedly make her sleep on the floor or make her run as a punishment . In danger: The young girl and her sister had gone to live with Cockrell and his fiancee in October 2009 . Life cut short: Lexi is pictured with her father. They lived at the dirty home with Smith and four other children . The trial is expected to last six weeks. Among the witnesses called to the stand will be the paramedics who answered the 911 call and Smith's parents, who lived in an apartment above the couple's. Defense attorney Jenny Cooke said Lexi was not killed by the abuse. Instead, she said the girl became ill and suffered from pneumonia. She claimed that the bruises were caused by typical childhood accidents or by one of the other children, and that Lexi's weight loss had not been obvious to Smith. Cooke added that the only evidence that Cockrell hit his daughter came from Smith's claims. The defense will portray Smith as an . unreliable witness addicted to painkillers who struck up a deal to . avoid a possible death sentence, The Oregonian noted. 'Killers': Michelle Nicole Smith, right, has already pleaded guilty to murdering her Cockrell's (left) daughter . After the death, the state Department of Human Services took temporary custody of the surviving children and they are reportedly now living with relatives. Heather Pounder, Lexi's biological mother, said her daughters had been staying with Cockrell and Smith since the October before her death, and said Cockrell rarely let her see the child. The last time she saw her was nearly four weeks before her death. 'There's really no words to explain what it's like for me,' she said after the arraignment. 'I try to find the words and I can't - my worst nightmare.'","Lexi Pounder was found beaten and malnourished in January 2010 .

"A mother was jailed for 45 years today for suffocating her six-year-old son in a motel room and dumping his body along a dirt road. Julianne McCrery, 42, of Texas admitted killing Camden Hughes by kneeling on his back and covering his mouth with her hand. The discovery of his body last May in Maine set off a nationwide effort to identify him. Meanwhile, his mother called his kindergarten daily to report him absent with appendicitis. Regrets: Julianne McCrery, 42, pictured left in court today, told the the judge she is 'very sorry' for the pain and suffering she caused her six-year-old son Camden Hughes, pictured right . McCrery later told prosecutors she had . planned to kill herself and that she killed Camden because no one else . was fit to raise him. But . prosecutors say they have evidence McCrery felt the boy was an . inconvenience and that she planned to go about her own life after . killing him. McCrery spent . the drive from Texas to New England contemplating how she would kill her . son, Senior Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell said. Jailed: McCrery pictured here as she looks back at her family after being sentenced to 45-years in prison in Rockingham County Superior Court on Friday for killing her son Camden . She said McCrery extinguished a bright star 'before he even had the chance to graduate from kindergarten'. Morrell . acknowledged that McCrery did not have an easy life but said . investigators could not determine what led her to consider suicide . and questioned McCrery's assertion that she planned to kill herself. Morrell pointed out that McCrery had attempted suicide several years earlier by similar means and had failed. 'This case raises more questions than there are answers for,' Morrell said. Happier times:  Camden Hughes, 6, pictured left with McCrery, was brutally killed at the hands of his mother and dumped on a dirt road in Maine . Tragic: The young boy, pictured here, was described as a 'bright star' and as an extraordinary' boy in court . McCrery spoke tearfully at her sentencing hearing, calling her son ""extraordinary."" ""I am very sorry to have caused the intense pain and suffering to my precious son Camden,"" she said. ""He did nothing whatsoever to deserve that by my hand, and he was not an inconvenience to me. My sorrow is intense and unbearable."" Defense attorney Julia Nye said an insanity defense was considered, but McCrery rejected that option. 'She chose to accept responsibility for her actions,' Nye said.

I want to kill myself’ - after Camden ( pictured right in computer-generated police appeal image) was found dead . She told investigators she covered his mouth with her hand as he struggled to survive. Morrell said the pressure McCrery applied to Camden was so great it bruised one lung and the base of his skull. McCrery's son and brother both told her during remarks to the court that they love and forgive her. Her . brother, Chris Hughes, asked Superior Court Judge Tina Nadeau to . shorten the sentence a bit so her other son 23-year-old Ian McCrery, ""might . possibly have some time with her.""

McCrery thanked a family from South Berwick, Maine, for discovering . Camden's body and later starting a children's charity in his memory. She called them ""angels on earth"" for trying to bring some comfort to her son. Deadly journey: This map highlights the journey McCrery took with her son Camden from Irving in Texas and South Berwick in Maine, where she dumped his dead body . Lisa . Gove was en route to her in-laws' house on a remote road on May 14 when . she noticed a pickup truck with its doors open, bearing a Navy . insignia. She and her in-laws later discovered his body, which was under a green blanket 30 feet from the road. Gove's . detailed description of the truck and the Navy insignia led a driver at . a Chelmsford truck stop to spot McCrery's truck on May 18 with . her inside. When she was . questioned, McCrery identified herself and told police she had killed . her son at a Hampton motel and left his body under a green blanket by . the side of the road.

"Tortured: Shaurya Bulhara, aged six, was subjected to various forms of abuse from the age of three, suffering fractures and scars . The parents of a boy who was subjected to various forms of torture are now facing jail after being found guilty of attempt to murder. The abuse started when Shaurya was three-years-old and getting justice for him, now aged 13, was a long hard-fought battle for his maternal grandparents. His mother died when he was young and he lived with his father Lalit Balhara, a former Army Major, and step-mother Preeti Balhara. During the trial, Shaurya said he was . repeatedly tortured by the pair and claimed he was often locked up in a . room without food and beaten with a stick when he would cry, reported The Times of India. He also said they would insert a stick in his mouth which broke some of his teeth. The couple denied the . allegations, saying the child was 'special' by birth. They claimed he had suffered . injuries after falling off chairs and tables, but the medical report coupled . with the child's statement proved their guilt. Shaurya endured a cycle of abuse -  when he was aged three he was rushed to hospital for consuming insecticides. After that incident, the abuse increased and he also suffered fractured ribs, a bleeding skull and smashed teeth, while his weight dropped significantly. Yesterday the pair were charged with attempt to murder and also convicted under the Juvenile Justice Act. The judgement was a victorious moment for Shaurya's grandparents who . sought custody of the child in 2005 alleging his father, Lalit Balhara, . and his wife, Preeti, were torturing the child after his mother died. Damning X-rays: Multiple injuries sustained by Shaurya, including bone fractures and brain swelling, were explained away by his father and step-mother as him falling from chairs or tables . Terrible damage: A close-up photo of Shaurya's mouth shows damaged teeth, scarred skin and cut lips. It is alleged his parents forced a stick into his mouth as part of his punishment . When Shaurya was presented before the . court on February 20, 2005, his physical and mental condition shocked . the officials, according to the newspaper. Doctors were then asked to file a medical report and the Major . Balhara and his wife underwent psychiatric consultation at the Base . Hospital, Delhi Cantontment. The report stated the 'parents were unable to explain why the child . sustained injuries and concluded Shaurya was suffering from a 'battered . baby syndrome' - a combination of physical injuries such as broken bones, . bruises, burns and malnutrition as a result of gross abuse by a parent . or caregiver. Convicted: Former army officer Lalit Bulhara and his second wife Preeti have been charged with attempted murder and have also been convicted under the Juvenile Justice Act . Birth mother: Malit in 1997 with his first wife, unnamed in court papers, the biological mother of Shuarya . In February 2005, custody of Shaurya was granted to his grandparents. Attempt to murder entails a maximum punishment of life imprisonment and the pair will find out their fate this week. Soon after the judgment was pronounced, the Balharas who have been out on bail throughout the trial, were taken into custody. Away from harm: Shaurya, pictured in 2009, is now attempting to live a normal childhood after being freed from his torment .","Shaurya was three when he was first hospitalised for consuming insecticides .

"A child at the centre of the alleged Westminster paedophile ring in the 1980s has been traced by police and may be 'ready to spill the beans' about the politician he says abused him, it emerged today. The unnamed man, who is now in his 40s, says he was attacked by a senior political figure when he was eight and knew then he worked in the 'big house' - a reference to the Houses of Parliament. Scotland Yard has traced the alleged victim, who is a successful entrepreneur based in the United States but he has yet to make a formal statement to police. Scroll down for video . Abuse: A child at the centre of the alleged Westminster paedophile ring has been traced by police (file photo) But detectives have traced a copy of a statement he made more than 30 years ago when he was rescued from the abuse. During his interview in 1982, the child said his abuser worked in ‘the big house’, which detectives believe refers to the Houses of Parliament. The man subjected him to a horrific sexual assault and police working on the case at the time, who interviewed him, are said to have corroborated some of his evidence. Police have visited the victim, as the Mail reported in April this year, but he refused to give a statement confirming he had been abused. Detectives from Scotland Yard’s Operation Fernbridge – the unit set up to investigate allegations of an ‘Establishment’ paedophile ring – have been examining the case of the alleged victim. Campaign: There are calls for a public inquiry over alleged abuse by figures including Cyril Smith (pictured) A detective from the US, who conducted a secondment with the team, interviewed the man on behalf of Scotland Yard earlier this year. The alleged victim initially indicated that he would give a statement to police, only to change his mind. Although police obtained independent evidence of the specific abuse, it was not enough to execute an arrest. Scotland Yard has also spoken to an officer who worked on the original Elm Guest House case, and who interviewed the boy who is now in the United States. According to the Daily Telegraph the politician's name was not included in witness statements and never put forward in case of prosecution. It is alleged the man feared that he would be disciplined or lose his pension, so was reluctant.

"A toddler shows off her belly button in an adorable and innocent photograph that her family loved so much they chose to share it with friends. But after Marlow’s mother uploaded it on photo-sharing website Instagram she was shocked when her account was deactivated because it was deemed inappropriate. Courtney Adamo, 33, was sent an email by Instagram saying the image ‘violated the community guidelines’. Banned: Mother-of-four Courtney Adamo had her Instagram account shut down after posting this picture of her 19-month-old daughter Marlow . Strict policy: The blogger (pictured with her daughter Marlow) from Hampstead, north London, was told that she was 'violating community guidelines' by uploading the picture . The social media company removed the photo and also deleted a picture of 19-month-old  Marlow at the beach with her father. Confused, Mrs Adamo re-read the Facebook-owned firm’s guidelines and was convinced she had not broken any rules. So she reposted the photo to the 40,000 people who ‘follow’ her on Instagram. The mother of four, who runs an online boutique, said: ‘They said I violated their guidelines, which are very vague. Frustrated: Mrs Adamo, pictured with her two sons, two daughters and husband Adam (right) said the measure was 'crazy. Yesterday the Instagram account was up and running again, but the photo of Marlow is still banned . ‘Their guidelines say things like “no pornographic material”. So I thought, “That photo hasn’t violated anything”. I put it back up and that’s when my account was shut down. ‘So it turns out that photo does violate their terms and conditions because any female child of walking age or older cannot appear shirtless, according to Instagram.’ American-born Mrs Adamo, who is married to an animation company boss and lives in Highgate, North London, said she posted the two photos for her family who live across the Atlantic. ‘It’s ridiculous,’ she added. ‘If you look at mainstream companies that put out advertisements on national television you’ll see toddlers her age wearing just a nappy. ‘I believe I’ve only put up wholesome photos and I think my children will look back on them with fond memories.’ Don’t share photos or videos that aren’t yours. Don’t share photos or videos that show nudity or mature content. Don’t share photos or videos of illegal content.Don’t spam. Don’t be rude. Don't promote or glorify self-harm.

Mrs Adamo, who is also a mother to Easton, nine, Quin, seven and five-year-old Ivy, said she will be more careful about what she posts in future as she is worried about her photos being deleted. She said: ‘It’s the people that are making a fuss and sexualising it whose mindset you have to question.’ Instagram said: ‘We try hard to find a good balance between allowing people to express themselves creatively and having policies in place to protect young children.’ Clear-cut: Her account has now been reinstated, but the photo is still banned. She believes the site should make its policies clearer .

'Lowry at his very best': The 1960 oil painting of Manchester Exchange railway station, which closed in 1969, now ranks in the LS Lowry's top ten most expensive works ever sold at auction . The painting depicts workers heading to the London and North Western Railway Station, which was built in 1884, and crowds swelling around a large sculpture of Oliver Cromwell. Lowry produced a smaller version on the painting in 1962 to present to the Royal Academy of Arts on being made a Royal Academician. Frances Christie, Sotheby’s head of modern and post-war British art, said the painting was one of the most exciting Lowry works to emerge on the market in recent years. She added: ‘Lowry was a master at portraying the energy and vitality of everyday life and in Station Approach, Manchester he captures the hustle and bustle of the crowds heading home after a hard day’s work – it is a superb example of Lowry at his very best.’ Lowry, who lived in Greater Manchester, was famous for his paintings of matchstick men and industrial landscapes.","Station Approach, Manchester, snapped up by telephone bidder at Sotheby's .

"David Cameron sent a personal apology to Alan Titchmarsh after one of his Cabinet ministers called the TV gardener a ‘complete muppet’. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson attacked the presenter for questioning the Government’s response to ash dieback at the height of the disease in 2012.

The 64-year-old described Mr Cameron’s gesture as ‘incredibly big-hearted and generous’, adding: ‘He apologised for things that were said out of turn.’ 'Muppet': Mr Titchmarsh, left, was at the receiving end of an unguarded comment by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, right . Mr Paterson made the comment after Mr Titchmarsh criticised the official response to ash dieback. He claimed advice to wash boots, dogs and children after visiting woodland would have ‘minimal effect’. The minister later told the gardener he had not known he was being recorded when he made the comments to an interviewer. The pair have since made up. Mr Titchmarsh subsequently wrote to Mr Paterson to explain his position on ash dieback and was invited to his home. The gardener told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We discovered – which I think shocked him – that in 95 per cent of matters we were in complete agreement.’ Mr Titchmarsh said he tried not to get into disputes as his philosophy ‘is to try and not upset people, to just bump my way through and try to not get in anybody’s way’. But he had more criticism for the Government, saying the Conservatives ‘were traditionally a party of the shires and they – how can one put it? – seem to have drifted away from that.’","Environment Secretary Owen Paterson made the jibe in 2012 .

"Tenants struggling with the rent were offered free Cadbury's creme eggs as a reward for keeping up payments . Tenants struggling with the rent were offered free Cadbury’s creme eggs as a reward for keeping up payments. The offer of the 60p chocolate treat was made by a housing association in Wales – although travelling to collect the gift would cost tenants as much as £6.40 in bus fares. Letters were sent out by Bridgend-based Valleys to Coast (V2C) to those affected by the Government’s so-called bedroom tax as recognition of their ‘payment efforts’. But critics branded the gesture ‘bizarre and obscene’. V2C tenant Kay Harris, from Bettws, near Bridgend, said: ‘The Government are walking all over vulnerable people and a 60p Cadbury’s creme egg ain’t going to help them out. 'Our landlord should be helping, not insulting us.’ Miss Harris, 47, added that tenants would have to pay around £6.40 in bus fares to collect the chocolate. Nigel Draper, V2C’s head of neighbourhoods, said in a letter dated April 22: ‘V2C understands that this has been a challenging time and wants to recognise your payment efforts. ‘We know that money is much tighter now with household bills such as food and fuel having increased year on year. ‘As well as thanking you by letter, we would also like to offer you as a small thank you a free creme egg should you call into the office during the month of April.’ Jamie Insole, from Cardiff and South Wales Against the Bedroom Tax, said: ‘It is rare that one encounters anything so simultaneously bizarre and obscene.’ Letters were sent out by Bridgend-based Valleys to Coast (V2C) to those affected by the Government's so-called bedroom tax as recognition of their 'payment efforts' But Mr Draper defended the letter, saying it was a reminder to tenants to seek financial advice. He said: ‘The letter of thanks and small gesture of the creme egg is an important recognition to those tenants who have struggled to find additional rent due to  the UK government imposed bedroom tax policy. ‘The invitation to attend one of our regular walk-in sessions in Bridgend and pick up a free creme egg over Easter was a way of reminding tenants that even during the school holidays staff are available to help with financial advice.’","Offer of 60p chocolate treat was made by housing association in Wales .

"Last month Jessica Livings, 19, revealed she had caught TB while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat, Onyx . A teenager told last night of her horrific ordeal of catching TB from her pet kitten. In what is believed to be the first case of its kind in the world, Jessica Livings was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency surgery. The 19-year-old was later rushed back to hospital in agony for further treatment for severe lung damage. Another victim suffered the same symptoms of bovine tuberculosis and Jessica’s mother Claire contracted the dormant form of the disease. It also emerged that a child from the south west caught TB from a pet dog. The youngster, who was under 10, eventually recovered, but the dog was put down. It is thought that the pair who caught the disease from a cat did so when cleaning a wound on the pet, which they had taken in only five weeks before. Jessica said: ‘I lost a stone and half in five weeks, I was very ill and had fevers, cold sweats and hallucinations. I didn’t realise what was real and what wasn’t.’ The kitten, which is thought to have picked up the disease from badgers, has died from the illness. Thirty-nine people who may have been in contact with infected cats have been offered screening for TB. Jessica was diagnosed with the disease in October after a vet raised concerns about an outbreak among cats in the Newbury area of Berkshire. Seven of the nine infected creatures had bite wounds thought to have come during fights with badgers. Six have been put down or have died and an 18-month-old tabby named Milhouse has vanished. Jessica is now categorised as being at no risk of passing on TB despite her emergency readmission to the Royal Berkshire Hospital last month. She is on a nine-month course of antibiotics. She said: ‘I feel much better now, last year was very tough especially because I didn’t know what it was.’ Onyx: Both Miss Livings and her mother Claire caught the disease from this kitten, though Claire only contracted a dormant form - meaning she is infected but has no symptoms . Her mother said: ‘For the first three weeks Onyx was fine then he became poorly and we discovered he had an open wound under his belly. We took him to the vet two times and the third we kept him in. ‘He died two days later. We had no idea it was TB. ‘But we were very careful and conscious to be clean around him but somewhere along the line we weren’t as careful as we should have been. ‘When Onyx died we were told they’d run some tests as he died so suddenly and then we found out he had TB. Carl Gorman, who is the vet who reported the outbreak as well as being the owner of missing Milhouse, believes it started with a local herd of cows contracting TB. He is treating the two surviving cats despite Nigel Gibbens, the chief veterinary officer, stating: ‘For public health reasons the most sensible course of action when a cat is diagnosed with culture-confirmed M bovis infection is euthanasia rather than treatment.’ Dr Gorman said: ‘The CVO’s advice is correct but we can’t force the pet-owners to put their animals to sleep at the moment. That’s the law. ‘We can give them advice and inform them of the risks. Every case has to be looked at individually. The two cats we are treating at the moment do not have any external sores so they are both low risk.’ Public Health England confirmed two patients infected by the TB bacteria mycobacterium bovis were undergoing treatment. Officials said two others have been diagnosed with latent TB. This means they have been exposed to the disease but are not showing symptoms. Dilys Morgan, of Public Health England, said: ‘These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human transmission.’ The British farming industry is forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with TB each year. In total nine cats are known to have been infected. Jasper (left) died after contracting the disease, while Mocha (right) was put down in keeping with guidance from the UK's chief vet . It is argued that the spread of the disease is accelerated by badgers and the Government is undertaking a cull to try to combat the problem. It is rare for cats to contract TB, with about 25 cases each year in Britain. The nine infected cats all lived within three miles of each other –  and six within a 250-yard radius. Another pet owner has told of her anguish after her cat contracted tuberculosis and had to be put down. Julie Foster, 38, said that when Mocha developed a painful lump on his paw she and husband Russell, 34, had no idea it could be the disease. ‘We’d never heard of cats with TB,’ the mother of one said. ‘The whole thing has been a complete mystery.’ Another cat called Jasper is known to have died after being infected.","Jessica Livings, 19, caught TB from her pet kitten Onyx .

"He was forced to issue a grovelling apology after claiming Wimbledon Ladies Champion Marion Bartoli was ‘never going to be a looker’. But John Inverdale and the tennis ace will now have to put their differences aside as they will be presenting ITV’s coverage of the French Open together. Miss Bartoli, who retired following her dramatic triumph last year, will join the 56-year-old presenter for the two-week tournament at Roland Garros, Paris, next Sunday. Colleagues: John Inverdale will be joined by Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli during ITV's coverage of the French Open tournament. Inverdale had previously made derogatory comments about the French star . Mr Inverdale will have to be on his best behaviour after his disparaging remarks last year provoked a furious backlash from listeners. The BBC was deluged by 674 complaints after the presenter, who anchored the channel’s coverage of the Wimbledon championships, made the comments during an interview with Radio 5 Live ahead of the women’s final. He said: ‘I just wonder if her dad, because he has obviously been the most influential person in her life, did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, “listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker. “You are never going to be somebody like a (Maria) Sharapova, you’re never going to be 5ft 11in, you’re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that.”’ Mr Inverdale was branded a ‘sexist moron’ by listeners, but Miss Bartoli seemed unfazed by his remarks. Victory: Marion Bartoli holds the Wimbledon trophy after her victory in 2013 . Joining the team: Andy Murray's former coach Mark Petchey, left and four-time Grand Slam winner Jim Courier will also appear on ITV's coverage . The 29-year-old said: ‘I invite this journalist to come and see me this evening in ball gown and heels, and in my opinion he could change his mind. I am not blonde, yes. Have I dreamt about having a model contract? No. But have I dreamed about winning Wimbledon? Absolutely.’ Mr Inverdale said last night [Wednesday]: ‘Both the men’s and women’s games are intriguing at the moment, with the old guard being challenged by so much exciting new talent. ‘I know that the team, with Marion as a fantastic addition providing real insight into both the tennis and Roland Garros as a venue, are all looking forward to it enormously.’ The pair will be joined by four-time Grand Slam winner Jim Courier, Andy Murray’s former coach Mark Petchey, Fabrice Santoro, who played in a record 70 Grand Slams, and former British ladies number one Sam Smith.

"Arthur Ransome: The author had extensive files kept on him by MI5 . He is fondly remembered as the author of Swallows And Amazons, a tale of lakes and boats that was one of the best-loved children’s books of the 20th century. But nearly 100 years ago Arthur Ransome was accused of less innocent writings - with MI5 suspecting he was a Russian spy. British secret agents considered him an ardent Bolshevik and believed he was ‘a man who paints Russia as a paradise on earth’. Details of Ransome’s ‘harmful’ political activities are among 150 top secret MI5 files opened during the First World War which are available online today for the first time. Hand-written and typed intelligence reports, postcards and photographs of people and organisations involved in espionage were digitised by the National Archives. Ransome enchanted generations of children with his stories happy families, holidays and not-very-dangerous adventures. But today’s files show the British government’s agents and spies had concerns about the Rugby-educated writer’s true motives. Despite being on the payroll of MI6 - code number S76 - to gather intelligence against Russia, the security services believed he could be an enemy of the state and a supporter of Bolshevist revolution. As foreign correspondent for the now-defunct Daily News, Ransome witnessed the October Revolution of 1917 and became friendly with Lenin, founder of the Bolsheviks, and Trotsky, leader of the Red Army. He also had an affair with Trotsky’s secretary, Eugenia Shelepina, and eventually married her in 1924 after helping her emigrate from Russia because she was ‘exposed to danger’ after helping MI5. One typed military intelligence report, published online today, from July 1918 concludes that ‘Ransome has applauded the Bolsheviks to such an extent in his newspaper writing  that one is almost forced to a conclusion that he is a Bolshevik himself.’ Then in October 1918 an MI5 file notes that Ransome, at the time living in Stockholm, had ‘considerable influence’ with the Soviets. During his time as a foreign correspondent, Ransome became friendly with Vladimir Lenin, left, and Leon Trotsky, right, two of the key architects of the 1917 Russian Revolution . A Dutch minister, WJ Oudendyk, warned that he was ‘continuing his propaganda work’ against Britain. He noted Ransome had told friends in Russia he could ‘persuade the Bolsheviks that they may count on a large measure of support from the working classes in England’ in the event of revolution. He arrived back in the UK in early-1919 but then applied to return to Russia as correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. A scrawled handwritten note from that April cautions that if Ransome is to be permitted to go back ‘can we take him out of all anti-Bolshevik theatres of operation. If the decision to attempt to do so is final [we] must take action without delay.’ But on August 16, Brigadier General William Thwaites said in a despatch to Sir Edward Troup at the Home Office that it would be ‘most undesirable for a British subject who holds such views as Ransome does to go to Russia. I should say he would do less harm in this country.’ Meanwhile, the National Archives files reveal concerns over the relationship between the British scout movement - more often associated with camping and knot-tying - and their counterparts in Germany.In the aftermath of the Great War relations between scouts in the two countries were hostile. Letters from 1919 show that there were objections to German scouts attending the international jamboree in London Olympia the following year. A letter from the Foreign Office states: ‘The attitude of the British Boy Scouts Association is that they will certainly not have any German Boy Scouts here next year at their international show at Olympia.’ The files also reveal fears that the Boy Scout Association was being infiltrated by Communists during the First World War. The files reveal fears that the Boy Scouts was being infiltrated by Communists during the First World War . In a case of ‘red under the camp beds’, correspondence from 1920 shows that enquiries were made about the ‘red boy scout movement’ and its influence in Britain. Investigations showed ‘no record of any such movement’ but fears resurfaced in 1954 when a 19-year-old Scout was thrown out of the organisation because he was a member of the Young Communist League’s National Committee. Paul Garland, a scout from the age of eight, was accused of conducting ‘anti-religious propaganda’ and was forced to leave the movement. The file says of Mr Garland: ‘Not only has he been found inspired by communist ideas, but to be a high-ranked communist leader as well, who as such made oath to conduct anti-religious propaganda. ‘The National Board declared, that GARLAND could not keep his scout’s pledge, as the first article of this reads: “I hearby solemnly promise earnestly to try to do my duty towards God and my country.” ‘In the opinion of the Board the question had nothing to do with politics’ the point, however, was whether a scout can keep a promise, when he is a Communist.’ The files are part of the National Archives’ First World War 100 programme of digitised releases and events to mark the centenary of the 1914-18 conflict. They contain details of spies around the world, including British nurse Edith Cavell who was executed by the Germans for saving captured soldiers and Mata Hari, the notorious female spy and entertainer. National Archives records specialist Dr Stephen Twigge said: ‘The files in the National Archives’ collection reveal the importance of the security service in safeguarding the nation during the First World War. Now people across the globe can discover the secret history behind the war for themselves.’","British secret agents considered Ransome an ardent Bolshevik .

"Shock: Mother Kelly Wissenden caught doctor Nurpal Mittal going through her purse while she was tending to her sick child in another room . A thieving GP stole £130 from a mother’s purse after she left the consulting room to attend to her sick baby son. Kelly Wissenden, 29, caught  family doctor Nurpal Mittal rifling through the handbag she had left with her son’s buggy in the office. The physician, 33, now faces being struck off the medical register after a jury found her guilty of theft. She is also likely to receive a large fine for ‘breaching the sacred trust between doctor and patient’, the court heard. Judge James O’Mahony told Mittal: ‘A patient has the right to expect that the last person in the world who would steal from them was a doctor. ‘I want to know why on earth you could have done this.’ Miss Wissenden took her nine-month-old son Zaio Headley, who had an upset stomach, to White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover on June 19 last year. During her appointment,  the mother of two was asked  to take Zaio to a baby changing room in the surgery to take  a specimen sample for tests. But when she returned to the GP’s office, she found Mittal going through her bag. Prosecutor Andrew Forsyth told the court: ‘Miss Wissenden described seeing Dr Mittal  fiddling round near the change bag and the buggy, looking very  flustered.’ He added: ‘She thought it strange at the time but didn’t say anything.’ Cross-channel ferry stewardess Miss Wissenden had £130 cash in her purse, which she had withdrawn earlier that day to pay for a car repair. But she said she realised the money was missing only after she had left the surgery. Miss Wissenden returned to the practice straight away and spoke to a receptionist, Canterbury Crown Court heard. They searched the doctor’s room and the changing area where she had taken Zaio, finding nothing. But when Mittal persuaded them to check the changing area again, the cash had mysteriously appeared on the floor. Miss Wissenden reported the incident to police later that day. In the evening, she received a phone call from Mittal asking her to withdraw the theft allegation, the jury was told. The GP, who was working at White Cliffs Medical Centre in Dover, pictured, was found guilty of theft and now faces being struck off the medical register . After being convicted of theft, Mittal, from Shepherdswell, near Dover, was bailed until June when she will be sentenced. The court heard she had previously received a caution for shoplifting in Scotland. The judge told Mittal: ‘This is a sad state of affairs. The jury have found you guilty on overwhelming evidence of being a thief, and not just a thief but one who stole from one of your own patients.’ He requested a mental health report before sentencing, saying: ‘Given the fact she probably receives a healthy salary, who knows why she would want to steal £130 or go shoplifting?’ Miss Wissenden said: ‘It’s really shocking, it’s horrible. ‘I put my faith in her, my son’s life was in her hands and she stole from me. It’s been such a stressful time. The reaction you get when you tell people is, “Really, but she’s a doctor?” ‘The barrister even told me to expect a not guilty verdict because the jury was more likely to believe a doctor over me.’","Kelly Wissenden, 29, left consultation room to tend to sick nine-month-old .

"Busy city workers are to be offered £200 fertility ‘MoTs’ during their lunch breaks. The one-hour test will assess women using a combination of advanced 3D ultrasound and blood tests, while men will be offered a detailed analysis of their semen for £90. Up to 4,000 IVF cycles will also be offered each year by the Create Fertility centre, which opens in London later this month. The Create Fertility centre will  aim to offer 4,000 IVF cycles each year but not conventional IVF treatment . Professor Geeta Nargund, who founded what is now Europe’s largest IVF clinic, said: ‘A woman’s fertility potential can be assessed in an hour.’ She said clients are offered advice depending on their fertility potential for their age.’ However, Professor Nargund’s clinic near St Paul’s will not offer conventional IVF where powerful drugs are used to stimulate the ovaries. Instead the centre will offer natural-cycle IVF, in which a woman’s egg is collected following her natural cycle and replaced in the uterus after fertilisation. The clinic will also offer mild-stimulation IVF, in which a lower dosage of drugs is used. Professor Nargund added: ‘Our primary ethos is to avoid invasive techniques and improve conditions for conception before using drugs.’ She said the treatment is safer, less expensive and is able to be repeated over subsequent cycles. Her business offers three cycles of natural-cycle IVF for £5,900, while three cycles of mild-stimulation IVF costs £6,950. At the centre, three cycles of natural-cycle IVF costs £5,900 and three cycles of mild-stimulation IVF will set you back £6,950 . However Gedis Grudzinskas, an independent consultant gynaecologist, warned potential patients about success rates. He said: ‘While offering alternatives to conventional IVF is very positive, patients need to be aware of the success rates. Satisfying results are much lower in natural cycles than when drugs are used.’ He added: ‘The live-birth rate for natural IVF is unlikely to be more than 10 per cent, especially in older women.’ But Professor Nargund said the latest results from Create Fertility show a 27 per cent live-birth rate for women under 37 who were using their own eggs within a Natural IVF cycles, and a 40 per cent live birth rate for those under 35 using Mild IVF. The arrival of the clinic comes after it emerged that Britain is to get its first NHS-funded national sperm bank in October to make it easier for lesbian couples and single women to have children. For as little as £300 – less than half the cost of a private clinic – they will be able to search an online database for an anonymous donor based on their physical characteristics, profession and even hobbies.","London clinic opening later this month will test men and women in an hour .

"Mother-of-two Naudel Turner, 42, was pronounced dead in hospital after she was stabbed at least four times in the neck in Tottenham, north London . A nurse stabbed to death in broad daylight is thought to have been killed by one of her mental health patients. Naudel Turner, 42, was attacked soon after she left work on Wednesday afternoon. The churchgoing mother of two had screamed at her assailant to ‘leave me alone’ seconds before he stabbed her in the neck multiple times with a kitchen knife. Yesterday it emerged that as Mrs Turner slumped to the ground, some bystanders filmed the scene on their mobile phones. Witnesses described how after the frenzied attack, her assailant calmly rolled a cigarette as he stood over Mrs Turner’s body, wiped his hands on her clothing and said: ‘I told you, I told you.’ He was then seen yanking the blade out of her neck and placing it on her chest as she lay dying on the busy street in Tottenham, North London. Police arrested the man at the scene. Mrs Turner was taken to hospital, but doctors were unable to save her. Her husband William, 61, is said to be ‘shell-shocked’. He appeared distraught at the couple’s terrace home in Fulham, West London, yesterday. When asked about his wife, he said only: ‘She used to live here. But not any longer.’ A close friend and neighbour, who asked not to be named, said Mrs Turner ‘doted’ on the couple’s sons, aged 22 and 19. ‘She just loved her family to pieces,’ they added. ‘They’re upstanding members of the community. It’s a massive shock. She was such a gentle woman. She’s an angel.’ A police forensic team at Bruce Grove in north London, where a 42-year-old mother-of-two Naudel Turner was stabbed to death. Dariusz Miakienko, 46, of Lordship Lane, Tottenham, has been charged with murder . The friend revealed Mrs Turner’s attacker was thought to be an ex-patient of hers. ‘I think this must have been a nutter who’s been let down by aftercare because of the cuts to the NHS,’ they said. ‘Someone . that can stab an innocent person who has been helping them is clearly . not all there. Who could stab a wife, a mother, a community nurse? How . can anybody do that and roll a cigarette over her dead body?’ She said of Mrs Turner’s husband: ‘He is shell-shocked. It is just so raw. He’s not sleeping.’ Witnesses . said Mrs Turner had just left Castle View Surgery in Tottenham when she . was accosted by a man who started a ‘blazing row’. One . woman said the nurse screamed ‘leave me alone’ and ‘froze in fear’ as . the knifeman struck. He then wiped his bloody hands on her clothes, . saying: ‘I told you, I told you.’ Another witness added: ‘I heard the screaming so I went over to see what was happening. ‘I . saw the woman lying on her back with neck wounds. There was blood . everywhere. There was a man stood a few feet away from her against the . railings. I asked him if he was okay, but he didn’t answer. Officers were said to be looking at traces of tobacco, following claims the alleged killer rolled a cigarette after stabbing Mrs Turner at least four times . ‘I . looked at her and she was still breathing. A kitchen knife was laying . on her chest. It wasn’t embedded, it had just been placed there. ‘I was leaning over her and she was looking down. Then she looked up at me, took a breath, and shut her eyes. ‘Two blokes came over and wrestled the guy to the ground and sat on him until the police came.’ Staff . at Mrs Turner’s workplace refused to discuss whether her attacker was a . former  mental health patient, but police said the possibility was . being explored. One colleague, Dr Fariba Azarian, said they were ‘shocked and distraught’. ‘She . was an absolutely lovely, lovely lady,’ she said. ‘One of the most . professional and caring people that I have seen. She was somebody who . would go out of her way to help people and patients.

"Rosie O'Donnell returned to The View today for what is being billed as a new version of the long-running show. But apparently the cantankerous comedienne is up to her old tricks behind the scenes. Sources at The View tell MailOnline that Rosie has already become a terror, only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts; Whoopi Goldberg and newcomers Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot, she's literally running the show. 'She was at The View for several days last week, meeting with producers and telling them ""how things are going to go"". She has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line,' a show insider told MailOnline . Scroll down for video . She's baacck: 'Almost show time #theVIEW,' wrote Rosie, getting her make up done for her first live show today. Love you, mean it?  Newbies Rosie O'Donnell, Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace put their hands together for returning Whoopi. But show insiders say Rosie wants to rule the roost as moderator . Toeing the line: Rosie was sure to get a pedicure,  fearing her unkempt feet might draw attention from the show as she recovers from some sciatica. The first day of The View's new host lineup saw the return of the cantankerous former emcee after an eight-year absence . Two Rosies! Rosie O'Donnell is back after a contentious exit and several years absence and she's brought another Rosie with her - actress and activist Rosie Perez . Last Wednesday, Rosie and new co-host Nicole Wallace did a test show with two fill-in hosts in an effort to build chemistry. Neither Rosie Perez or Whoopi Goldberg were present. Despite the fact that Whoopi is the regular moderator for the show, leading the discussion, Rosie took charge of the test show with Nicole. 'It was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator. It's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before,' offered our source. Rosie joined The View in 2006, replacing Meredith Vieira. But the following year Rosie and Elizabeth Hasselbeck had a heated exchange that got so intense producers cut to a split screen, something that Rosie despised. She walked off the set that day and never returned to the show. But Whoopi was clear after Rosie complained several times in recent days: 'I'm moderating and that's how it's going to be, so work with me babe!' 'Rosie actually said aloud, ""This is taking forever! I know we're on tape, but should it take 4 hours?"" Pulling her weight: All the ladies on the panel were fascinated as former George W Bush staffer turned Sarah Palin wrangler recalled her days in the controversial White House and ill-fated McCain campaign trail . 'No one responds when she makes snarky comments except Whoopi, because everyone else fears for their job,' detailed the source. The sentiment backstage after the test show was that the four co-hosts were 'boring together' and they were going to have to find some excitement before today's show. But other than barefoot Rosie rubbing her tired tootsies, the magic wasn't there. Gawker called The View's tribute to Joan Rivers 'the worst ever.' 'I can hear Joan Rivers going, ""Ugh!"" over and over in her grave in response to this treacly tribute from Kristin Chenoweth on today's episode of The View, wrote Rich Juzwiak. 'Based on what happened in the test show, the only company that'll be sponsoring this show after next week will be AARP and any other brand targeting senior citizens. There's nothing magical about the chemistry with these four and the show just feels older,' the source added. Rosie Perez apparently seemed overwhelmed by her experience at the tape shows and had this look of as though she was second-guessing her decision to sign on. Whoopi continues to make jokes about how she can't wait until her contract is up and 'I wish ABC would just pay me to go home!' In the end, it is clear that returning to The View was Rosie's redemption for how things ended first time after her unceremonious exit after an on-air spat with Elizabeth Hasselbeck. Appearing for the first time on the panel today was token blonde Nicolle Wallace, who conservative credentials beat even Bush-loving Elizabeth Hasselbeck since Wallace actually worked for George W. And in the third corner, the wildcard: known for her voice as much as for her no-holds-barred New York City attitude - actress Rosie Perez. Barbara gave her blessing: The queen herself made an appearance as the ladies of her show held court and each kissed her hand . But don't expect too many screaming matches or claims that the world is flat (here's looking at you Sherri Shepherd): O'Donnell says the new View will be smarter, calmer and an all-around better show. The live show began calmly, with introductions and a nod to creator and news media queen Barbara Walters, who held court from a throne and had her hand kissed by each of the hostesses, including the only one remaining from the previous season, Whoopi Goldberg. 'Welcome to the newer view,' joked Whoopi, before introducing Rosie O'Donnell. O'Donnell kicked things off by catching up with viewers, including a discussion of her heartache and the gastric bypass surgery that followed. Up next, an introduction of the other Rosie--actress Rosie Perez, who plugged her upcoming Broadway show and memoir. Then came Nicolle Wallace: former George W. Bush press secretary for six years. 'I am a Republican, I should get that out of the way,' she said through a smile to audience uproar on both sides of the aisle. Before things got too out of control, fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell piped in: 'And I like her, I swear!' True to form, though, the group jumped right into a contentious topic--the Ray Rice domestic abuse saga and further questions over child and sex abuse. 'All about money, all about the brand being jeopardized,' politico Wallace chimed in first on the Rice issue. Perez agreed there's no excuse for hitting women, used her sports hero, convicted abuser Floyd Mayweather, to make the point that one's environment could be at fault as much as the individual.'[You] Respond the way you were taught,' said the actress. But should one continue to support the likes of Mayweather and Rice by paying for event tickets? O'Donnell didn't think so. 'I haven't seen a Woody Allen movie since the allegations came out,' O'Donnell said, moving the conversation along to her own struggles with abuse. Though she did say she continues to appreciate Chris Brown as an artist, despite his violent past. 'O'Donnell!' replied the contestant. 'Wrong,' O'Donnell bellowed to the young lady's chagrin. Ask Me Anything: A new segment gave the ladies and their viewers some time to catch up and get to know the panel--for instance: Wallace hates Hillary, Rosie O'Donnell had a gastric bypass, Perez has a forthcoming memoir, and Whoopi, well, she's been enjoying her shoes . Another new segment came in the form of an audience participation game called Ro or Ro? where contestants must decide which Rosie is being described on a card . Loss but a win: While this episode's contestant lost Ro or Ro? with only one correct answer, the game did reveal a little known and astonishing fact about Perez--she practices tae kwon do! Perez and O'Donnell introduced a new audience participation game they will play each day together, a play on their identical names called Ro or Ro? In the game, the audience members try to win a prize by deciding which Rosie does the thing being described on a card. The show concluded with the tribute to Rivers that began with a song in the comedienne's honor by Broadway diva Kristin Chenoweth. Sour note: 'I can hear Joan Rivers going, ""Ugh!"" over and over in her grave in response to this treacly tribute from Kristin Chenoweth on today's episode of The View, wrote Rich Juzwiak .","Even before The View debuted today, Rosie O'Donnell was letting everyone know she's top dog .

"A father who killed his infant son more than a decade ago was found guilty on Tuesday of also murdering his 2-month-old daughter, whose decomposing remains were found in a trash bag at an Arkansas storage unit. Jason Hann, 38, was convicted of first-degree murder and one count of assault on a child resulting in death, according to the Riverside County district attorney's office. The Vermont man was living in Desert Hot Springs east of Los Angeles in 2001 when he became angry that his daughter, Montana, was crying. He struck her in the head and killed her, prosecutors said. Jason Hann, right, was convicted on Tuesday of murdering his 2-month-old daughter, Montana, while mom Krissy Lynn Werntz, left, is awaiting trial on one count of murder . Hann and the girl's mother stuffed the body into a ‘blue Tupperware-type plastic container’ and moved away, keeping it in trailers and motorhomes for nine months as they moved from state to state living a ‘transient, gypsy-style life’ doing odd jobs, authorities said. The couple eventually arrived in Arkansas and left the body in a trailer at a storage facility, authorities said. They intended to return, but they missed some rental payments and their property was sold, authorities said. In February 2002, a man who bought the trailer found the girl's decomposed body wrapped in plastic bags, authorities said. Hann and the girl's mother, Krissy Lynn Werntz of Indiana, were arrested two months later at a motel in Maine. With them was a one-month old son, named Jason, who was found to have numerous broken ribs, bleeding under his skull and other internal injuries, according to the prosecution. Krissy Werntz, left and Jason Hann, center, are escorted from a courthouse in Portland, Maine in 2002 after their daughter's decomposing remains were found in a trash bag at an Arkansas storage unit . The state placed this child with foster parents, who eventually adopted him. Witness Jennifer Bloom, an employee of Maine's Department of Human Services, testified she and a colleague were sent to check on the new baby's welfare, and Hann admitted to being involved with the deaths of his two previous children. ‘He said he was responsible for both deaths. He didn't provide a lot of detail. He said, “I fell and blacked out with the baby,”’ Bloom said. She added Hann said he felt guilty about the death of his two previous children, and felt he had to keep moving to evade police. The body of the couple's first child, who also was named Jason, was found similarly wrapped in trash bags inside a rubber container, in a storage locker in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. He was 6 weeks old when he died in 1999. Hann and the girl's mother stuffed the body into a ¿blue Tupperware-type plastic container¿ and moved away, keeping it in trailers and motorhomes for nine months as they moved from state to state (stock image) Authorities said Hann had trekked around with the boy's body for 18 months. Hann was serving a 27- to 30-year prison sentence for that death when he was extradited to California in 2009 to be tried for Montana's death, and it took four years for the death-penalty case to make its way through the system and into opening arguments. He pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in that case, and California jurors found the special allegation that he had previously committed murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The other option would be life without possibility of parole. Werntz, 34, is awaiting trial on one count of murder. She was originally scheduled to be tried at the same time as Hann, but family medical problems have postponed her trial.","Jason Hann, 38, was convicted on Tuesday of murdering his 2-month-old daughter .

"A callous dog owner battered his pet to death before hurling the animal from the balcony of his 15th-floor flat in an attempt to cover up the attack. Dean Edwards, 44, beat two-and-a-half-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier Diesel so badly at his home in Bloxwich, Walsall, that he suffered 'catastrophic injuries' to his internal organs. Edwards was yesterday jailed for six months after the RSPCA and police found Diesel lying in a pool of blood on the ground. Shocking attack: Dean Edwards, left, beat his Staffordshire Bull Terrier so badly that the animal suffered 'catastrophic' internal injuries, and then flung him from the balcony of his 15-floor flat, right . The vicious dog owner claimed at the time that the first he was knew of Diesel being on the ground was when he was alerted by a neighbour. He told the neighbour he had thought the dog had been sleeping on his balcony and must have rolled off the edge. Tragic: Edwards told neighbours that Diesel must have rolled off the balcony while having a nap - but vets believe he was dead before he hit the ground . Inspectors decided sick Edwards was . lying, however, after blood was found on the balcony and inside the flat . following the dog's death on November 15 last year. Specialist vets said heavy bruising discovered on the dog's body was not consistent with a fall and that it was likely that Diesel was dead before hitting the ground. Edwards has been banned from keeping dogs for life after he was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Sentencing him, District Judge Michael Morris said: 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt you struck a fatal blow to Diesel and attempted to throw Diesel to the ground to cover your actions.' During a two-day trial, Walsall Magistrates Court heard that baseball and rounders bats were seized at Edwards' flat after Diesel was killed. Prosecuting Nick Sutton, said: 'The prosecution's case is that this man killed the dog and threw it from the balcony. 'He attempted to cover up the act by fabricating a fall.' A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: 'We are pleased to hear Mr Edwards was convicted of the offences and the sentence reflects the seriousness of the offence.'","Dean Edwards, 44, caused 'catastrophic internal injuries' to two-year-old dog Diesel .

"Three women who were allegedly recorded without their knowledge during sex with a disgraced Morgan Stanley banker are speaking out against the former executive's defense team. The alleged victims told the New York Post that John C. Kelly's high-priced lawyers are attempting to drag them through the mud in an effort to get him off the hook. Kelly is accused of planting cameras in his apartment on East 69th Street in New York City and recording his sexual encounters without the knowledge of his partners from May 2011 until December 2012. Now, Kelly's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, is claiming one of the alleged victims is actually a jealous stalker who only called the cops because she was spurned by the former banker. Fall from grace: John C. Kelly, the son of a prominent attorney, is fighting the charges that he illegally recorded his partners during sex . The woman, an Ivy League graduate, says Mr Brafman's claim is outrageous. 'It’s beyond humiliating. It hurts, it’s a betrayal and it’s so shameful,' one of the women told the Post. The Post reports that Kelly also allegedly recorded the women at their own apartments, setting up his open laptop facing the bed and claiming he needed the computer toe respond to work emails. A lawyer for one of the victims says he uploaded at least some of the videos to video sharing sites YouTube and Vimeo. One of the clips, a tryst with an Indian woman, was called 'India Research,' the Post reports. 'The videos are very shocking and disturbing,' a 34-year-old alleged victim told the newspaper. She said she met Kelly eight years ago and thought they had been in an exclusive relationship. 'It’s so creepy, because you can see him [on the video] setting them up, clicking away while we’re out of the room. And they’re angled in such a way that he’s showing off every intimate part of our bodies.' Canine scapegoat: Kelly told investigators he . had set up cameras to monitor his pooch (right) while he was at work, but . the devices ended up recording his sexcapade, according to police . Another alleged victim said: 'People . were crying when they saw them because they’re so violating — he would . look at the camera and it was clear that we didn’t know what he was . doing.' Authorities say Kelly, the son . of noted defense lawyer John Q. Kelly, had previously blamed his dog for . the videos - claiming he had set up cameras in his Manhattan apartment . to keep an eye on his pooch, but the device accidentally caught his . sexual escapades. 'It’s on . and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex . because it’s always recording,' police say Kelly told them February 26, 2013. According . to attorney Daniel Parker, who represents one of the women at the . center of the case, the X-rated recordings were not made by accident . since Kelly used a sophisticated surveillance system featuring a hidden . camera, a webcam and a phone application to record his victims in his . apartment and in their own homes, New York Post reported. In the doghouse: While Kelly has insisted that the surveillance was accidental, an attorney representing one of the victims claimed that the financier had a complex video recording system in place suggesting that he intended to tape his sex romps . Prosecutors claim Kelly shot videos of . his amorous activities with three different partners between September . 2011 and December 2012. Revelations of the conduct drove one woman to . trash his apartment. The women were in his apartment at separate times, the New York Daily News reported. ‘In this case, the defendant videotaped three unrelated women while they were performing sexual acts on him in his home,’ said prosecutor Siobhan Carthy during the financier’s arraignment in November, the paper reported. Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ the criminal complaint stated. The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said. One of the women who found out about the secret recordings broke into Mr Kelly’s apartment, according to the Daily News. She trashed the place, poured soda onto his computer and was charged with burglary. She only went to police after he had her arrested and she spent a night in jail, his lawyers claim. The charges have since been dismissed. Kelly was arrested in connection to the sex tapes November 8, 2013 - on the same day that he was fired from his job for allegedly writing bad checks, according to the Post. His father, John Q. Kelly, once represented former New York Yankee player Joe Pepitone and the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson - the slain wife of O.J. Simpson.","John Kelly has been accused of secretly filming sexual encounters with three women .

"Lawyers are scheduled to make opening statements Thursday at the trial of an Arizona woman accused of fatally bludgeoning her husband over the head with a hammer as he slept. Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36, claims killing Dale Harrell was an act of self-defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past. But authorities contend the January 2009 attack on Harrell was premeditated and say Devault has given conflicting accounts of her husband's death. Authorities also say the people Devault alleged were witnesses to the past abuse did not back up her claims. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Scroll down for video . Marissa Suzanne Devault, 36: She claims killing Dale Harrell was an act of self-defense and told investigators that her husband had physically and sexually abused her in the past .

Harrell, 34, suffered multiple skull fractures at the couple's home in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert and died at a hospice nearly a month after the attack of complications from his head injuries. Devault initially told investigators that her husband had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious. She also told police that when she came to, she saw another man who lived at their home beating Harrell with a hammer. But authorities say bloodstain patterns showed Harrell was alone in the bed at the time of the attack and that bloodstains on Devault's clothes were consistent with a person swinging an object repeatedly over her head. Investigators say Devault later confessed, saying she attacked her sleeping husband in a rage after he had sexually assaulted her. Confession: Devault initially told investigators that her husband had attacked her while she was asleep and choked her until she was unconscious.

Police say they later discovered Devault had been dating another man, Allen Flores, for more than two years. In a search of Flores' computer, police say they found a journal that appeared to be written from Flores' perspective indicating that he had given Devault about $7,000 and that she used it to hire a hit man, according to court records. Authorities say child pornography also was found on Flores' computer. County prosecutors granted Flores immunity on that allegation in exchange for his testimony in the murder case. Without such an agreement, Flores was expected to invoke his right against self-incrimination.","Marissa Suzanne Devault says that years of physical and sexual abuse led her to kill him .

"A Michigan man will spend life in prison for beating and strangling to death his girlfriend before chopping up and skinning her body to hide the evidence. William Dhondt, 29, was found guilty of first degree murder Friday in the grisly 2013 killing of Kaitlin Hehir, 29, in the Farmington home they shared. It took the jury only three hours to reach a verdict. The convicted killer told investigators in a taped interrogation played for the jury during his trial that he ‘sliced and diced’ Hehir’s corpse ‘like she was pot roast or some s**t,’ according to The Oakland Press. Better times: Kaitlin Hehir and William Dhondt shown in a picture posted online only months before her horrifying murder . At least one member of the jury was crying as the Dhondt’s guilty verdict for the Feb 23, 2013 slaughter of Hehir was read aloud, according to the Detroit Free-Press.  He showed no emotion. The murder was so horrific, and the evidence so graphic, that jurors are going to be provided counseling by the court after the week-long trial, according to the paper. Guilty: Dhondt will spend the rest of his life behind bars . Hehir’s family was present for the verdict, and more than one friend found satisfaction in hearing the word guilty before seeing the killer led out of the courtroom. ‘Sweet angel… he won’t ever hurt anyone again,’ Hehir’s friend Maria Ellis wrote on Facebook in the hours after trial wrapped. ‘Justice was served,’ another friend commented. Investigators showed up at the couple’s Farmington home the day after the murder when Dhondt called to report her missing – they soon obtained a search warrant and found her remains scattered throughout the house, jurors were told. The killing happened only one week after a glowing Hehir wrote on Facebook of her love for her soon-to-be killer on Valentine's Day. 'Flowers and strawberries?!?' She posted. 'I'm a very lucky girl. Thank you to my amazing boyfriend!' The wicked depravity of the death only came to light when he admitted his guilt to police in the shockingly graphic confession played in court. Dhondt told detectives he and Hehir became embroiled in a fight when she became upset after having to leave a party to pick him up at work. She had been drinking and was throwing up when they returned, he tried to give her a glass of water – she responded to the gesture by kicking him in the groin, he recalled. Then he snapped, ‘I f*****g laid her out,’ he bragged. ‘The defendant described hitting Kaitlin in the face with a glass cup, causing her to hit her head on a dresser and fall to the ground,’ Farmington Police Detective Andrew Morche said during Dhondt's arraignment last year, according to Michigan Live. 'Sweet angel': Friend Mary Ellis (left) wrote online that Dhondt 'won't ever hurt anyone again' after he was found guilty of murdering Hehir (right) Evidence: Police were shown the day after slaying leaving the home with bags of evidence . ‘She cracked her head on the dresser, and she was out, and that’s where I freaked out,’ he continued. ‘The defendant got on top of Kaitlin and hit her multiple times in the face with his fist, causing her to bleed from the nose and mouth,’ Morche continued. ‘I didn’t know where this was going to end, and I was an idiot,’ he told investigators. ‘The defendant slammed Kaitlin's head into the floor repeatedly, causing her to bleed form her head,’ Morche testified. ‘The defendant then used his hands to strangle Kaitlin to death while she struggled and fought for her life.’ ‘I choked her, to make sure,’ he told cops. Dhondt described how Hehir’s lifeless body lay on the floor for nearly two hours while he tried to figure out how to proceed. ‘Then my mind went off — ‘Let’s get rid of it.’ He dragged Hehir’s corpse to the basement and chopped it into pieces that he then stuffed in garbage bags, police said. Butchered: Dhondt admitted to police that he used a saw similar tot he one at right to cut through Hehir's bones and an X-Acto knife similar to the one at left to strip them of skin and muscles . ‘I took care of that and went to bed. I woke up, said ‘That’s not going to work,’ so I skinned her,’ Dhondt admitted, ‘removed flesh.’ Prosecutor Tricia Dare told jurors in graphic detail how he skinned the already mutilated body with an X-Acto knife and then went about removing the muscles before using a power saw to get through bones. ‘He tried to use a sawsall,’ she said, according to Macomb Daily. ‘Can you imagine what that must have been like, to use an X-Acto knife to cut the flesh of another human being? ‘And when he got to the bone, he got out a saw.’ Dare said Dhondt removing skin and muscles from Hehir’s arms was ‘like she’s an animal that he just hunted out in the woods.’ Where it happened: The Farmington home shared by Dhondt and Hehir . ‘He talks about it like it’s nothing — ‘Well, that way I can put it in the garbage and people will just think it’s salmon. … It’s not salmon. That’s a person,’ Dare continued. Displaying a total lack of awareness to the sorrow felt by his victim’s loved ones, Dhondt actually told police the aftermath ‘sucks’ because ‘it was probably four minutes of the worst thing that ever happened to me.’ Dhondt and his lawyer tried to paint Hehir as a cruel, belittling woman who often abused him, leading to the brutal slaying. The attorney pleaded in her closing statement for him to be convicted of voluntary manslaughter. He was found guilty of first-degree murder only hours later. The conviction carries a mandatory life sentence in Michigan which will be formally announced during an April 18 hearing. It is not clear if Dhondt will appeal the verdict, but his attorney told reporters gathered outside the courtroom the decision 'shocked' her.","William Dhondt, 29, was found guilty of first degree murder for the February 2013 killing of Kaitlin Hehir .
The grisly murder happened after the pair got into a drunken argument .

"American Football may soon have its first openly gay player and he  intends to keep playing after coming out. Football has never had a gay active player in its nearly 100-year history, but some have argued that it's time for a change. That change is likely to come sooner rather than later, as a player is reportedly preparing to make a public announcement about his sexual orientation before the 2013 season. Divisive issue: There has never been an openly gay active player in football's nearly 100-year history . Activists: Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, left, and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, right, have emerged as outspoken LGBT advocates in the NFL . CBS sportswriter Mike Freeman writes: 'I'm told that a current gay NFL player is strongly considering coming out publicly within the next few months - and after doing so, the player would attempt to continue his career.' Freeman did not say who the player is or any specifics about when his announcement would be made. But whoever the player is, he can count on the support of former players like Scott Fujita and active stars like Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, who are all outspoken LGBT advocates. Fujita told Freeman: 'I honestly think the players of the NFL have been ready for an openly gay player for quite some time now. Controversy: Chris Culliver sparked uproar when he suggested that gay men were not welcome in the 49ers locker room . He added: 'Trust me, the coming out of a player would create much bigger waves outside the locker room than inside.' But on the opposite end of the spectrum are opponents and a culture of homophobia. Days before the Super Bowl, San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver was asked about the prospect of gay players in the locker room during a radio interview. Culliver shot back: 'I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that.' When asked if he believed there were any gay players on the 49ers roster, Culliver responded: 'No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do.' Culliver later issued a bizarre apology for his remarks, saying that the comments were a 'reflection of thoughts in my head' but not representative of how he feels. A debate about gay players in the NFL was sparked anew in the Manti Te'o 'fake girlfriend' hoax, where the former Notre Dame football star claimed that he was the victim of a prankster who was posing as a woman and later faked her death. It was alleged that Te'o was gay and had invented the online persona in an attempt to cover it up. He denied he was behind the scam - as well as being gay - in an interview with talk show host Katie Couric. Hoax: A debate about gay players in the NFL was sparked anew in the Manti Te'o 'fake girlfriend' scandal, where the star claimed that he was the victim of an online prankster . At the NFL scouting combine earlier this month, Te'o - as well as several other players - were reportedly asked about their sexual orientations. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called such a line of questioning 'unacceptable,' and the New York attorney general has urged the league to investigate. Michigan quarterback-turned-receiver Denard Robinson, Colorado tight end Nick Kasa and Michigan State running back Le'Veon Bell indicated they were asked about their sexual orientation at the combine earlier this month in Indianapolis.

"2012 White House runner-up Mitt Romney is tanned, rested and ready and will win the presidency in 2016,a Utah congressman claimed on Monday. Rep. Jason Chaffetz and former Massachusetts Gov. Romney are both Utah Republicans and Mormons – Chaffetz is a Jew who converted in college – but he insisted on MSNBC's 'Hardball' program that his pick is guided by substance, not home-team rooting. 'I think he actually is gonna run for president,' he said during a segment he shared with Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, a fellow House Oversight Committee member. 'He probably doesn’t want me to say that.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz insisted that fellow Mormon Mitt Romney will be elected president in 2016 . Tanned, rested and ready? Romney says he's not running for president but the Utah Republican Party wants the RNC to let it draft him at the 2016 national convention in Cleveland, Ohio . 'A hundred times he says he's not [running],' Chaffetz conceded, 'but Mitt Romney has always accomplished what he's set out to do.' 'I think he’s proven right on a lot of stuff. I happen to be in the camp that thinks he’s actually going to run, and I think he will be the next President of the United States.' Chaffetz told the Salt Lake Tribune on Tuesday that 'there are more reasons [for Romney] to do it than not.' 'I haven’t yet consulted my Magic 8 Ball, but I bet it would come to the same conclusion.' A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that 45 per cent of Americans believe the country would be better off if Romney had won the presidency in 2012. Thirty-eight per cent say a President Romney would have made the country worse off. That same poll placed President Barack Obama at the top of a list of the 'worst presidents' since World War II. Utah Republican Party Chairman James Evans told the Deseret News on Tuesday that he wants the Republican National Committee to change its rules to leave the door open to drafting Romney into the presidential race even if he's not a declared candidate. 'It's never been done before,' Evans said. 'We're not going to stop until we have Gov. Romney as the Republican nominee.' Romney has been openly critical of the president in recent months, especially concerning the growing crisis in Iraq. 'His foreign policy is what has led to these crises all over the world and trying to recapture the lead, and keeping these kinds of things from happening is going to be a real challenge,' he told Fox News on June 12. 'I don’t know how we can go on with a country not having the kind of leadership that it needs. … This is the result of the president’s missteps over the past several years.' Stumping for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown in New Hampshire last week, Romney insisted that he won't run for president a third time. He was also a candidate in 2008, losing the GOP nomination to Arizona Sen. John McCain. The Associated Press reported that the Brown campaign held its rally at the same New Hampshire location where Romney launched his 2012 White House bid. Chaffetz was on the MSNBC program 'Hardball' along with Democrat Elijah Cummings, who serves with him on the House Oversight Committee . Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee (2nd R), accompanied New Hampshire senate candidate Scott Brown (R) during a campaign stop at a farm in Stratham, N.H. on July 2 . Former New . Hampshire Republican Gov. John Sununu boomed to a cheering crowd at the . event that 'we had an election in 2012 in which clearly the wrong . person won.' Brown . said later that 'New Hampshire knows Mitt Romney very, very well, and . not just because he won the presidential primary here.' After Romney spoke, he was 'mobbed,' the AP reported, by fans including some wearing t-shirts from his 2012 campaign. But he again rejected the idea of a Romney 2016 run. 'I'm going to get behind the one who I think has the best chance of winning,' he said, adding later that 'we'll get someone who can win.' 'The field of the republican candidates that I’m seeing are much better equipped' to run, Romney told NBC News last month at a GOP fundraising retreat in Colorado. 'I brought a number of the 2016 contenders here,' he said. 'If I had been running, I wouldn't be doing that.'","Rep. Jason Chaffetz said on MSNBC that Romney is 'actually going to run, and I think he will be the next president of the United States'
'He’s been proven right on a lot of stuff, said Chaffetz .
Romney has brushed aside questions about his political future but has gone on record to castigate the Obama White House for its handling of Iraq .
Chaffetz and Romney are both from Utah and the congressman converted from Judaism to Mormonism – Romney's faith – in college ."
"If they could do it all over again, Americans say they'd pick businessman Mitt Romney to run the country over President Barack Obama, a new survey finds. Romney would take 53 percent of the popular vote to Obama's 44 percent and beat Obama in almost every demographic group if the 2012 election were held today, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released yesterday. Men, women, white voters and voters aged 35 and older would all vote to replace Obama with Romney, the poll discovered, while only young and non-white voters would stick by the besieged president. The former Massachusetts Governor would lose handily to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, in a similar match-up. Redder on the other side: If the 2012 election were held today, Americans would elect businessman Mitt Romney instead of President Barack Obama . In a 2012 rematch, Romney would win with 53 percent of the vote to Obama's 44 percent. He would also best Obama in nearly every demographic group . In an election against Clinton, a presumed 2016 presidential candidate, Romney would lose by 13 points, the poll found. Clinton's numbers were buoyed up in the poll by women voters, who said they prefer the former first lady to Romney by a margin of two to one, and non-white voters. Nearly eight in 10 non-white voters said they'd vote for Clinton over Romney, highlighting the GOP's ongoing struggle to attract minorities to the party. Poll-takers also found that Hillary Clinton would blow potential Democratic competitors out of the water in 2016 if she decides to run, beating the next closest hypothetical candidate, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, by 57 points. A resounding 67 percent of Democrats selected Clinton as their first choice in 2016, while a mere 10 percent went with Warren. The two women were the only Democratic candidates polled who received double-digit support from members of their political party. Vice President Joe Biden, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley were favored by less than 10 percent of self-identified Democrats who took the poll, receiving support from eight percent, four percent and two percent of respondents. Another six percent of Democrats said they'd prefer someone else entirely. Hillary Clinton's overall popularity has slid since beginning her worldwide Hard Choices book tour, however. Roughly the same percentage of respondents to the poll said they consider Clinton a 'strong and decisive leader' - 63 percent now compared to 64 percent in early-March - but noticeably fewer gave her positive marks in other areas. Asked in March whether Clinton shares their values, 56 percent of survey-takers said yes. Only 51 percent say the same thing now. Clinton is also perceived by less Americans as caring about the needs of people like them now - 53 percent - than she was before - 56 percent. The shift in public opinion of Clinton's sympathies could be attributed to a slew of new stories on her wealth in the wake of a comment last month that she and her husband Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House. A majority of Americans making less than $50,000 a year, 57 percent, continue to say Clinton cares about them, however. President Barack Obama is also viewed more negatively across the board than he was in March. Then, 50 percent of poll-takers described the second-term president as 'strong and decisive.' Now, just 48 percent attribute those qualities to him. They are also less likely to think he can manage the government effectively, shares their values and cares about people like them. Romney wouldn't fare so well against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however. Clinton would take 55 percent of the vote in a hypothetical match-up against Romney and win win every demographic group but white voters . When it comes to Republicans' presidential prospects, CNN/ORC found it's still anyone's game in 2016. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie jumped to the top of Republican voters' 2016 wish lists, garnering 13 percent of survey-takers' support. Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Fox News host Mike Huckabee were close behind at 12 percent each. Texas Governor Rick Perry and 2012 Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan tied for third place with 11 percent of Republicans' support. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum were in the back of the pack. The five men were chosen in that order by: eight percent, Bush and Cruz; six percent; five percent and three percent of perspective Republican voters. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann are also considered potential 2016 candidates, but they were not included in the CNN/ORC poll. Bachmann, a 2012 candidate, did not indicate her interest in running again until after the poll was taken.","If the last presidential election were held now, Romney would beat President Obama by nine points .
Hillary Clinton would prevail over Romney with a double digit win, however .
Clinton would also trounce her competitors in the 2016 Democratic primary .

"Bravo is trying out two new women for their Real Housewives of Atlanta franchise. The TV network has cast actress/singer Demetria McKinney and model/host Claudia Jordan as what they call 'B characters,' MailOnline has learned. Both women will shoot scenes with the principal cast members -- NeNe Leakes, Phaedra Parks, Kandi Burruss, Cynthia Bailey, Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams -- and the network will wait to see how the audience responds to them before determining if they'll make them full-time cast members. They don't hail from Georgia and Claudia just moved to Atlanta from Los Angeles. Both are unmarried. B list: It will be up to RHOA audiences to determine  if Demetria McKinney and Claudia Jordan make the A team and join the show permanently . Georgia peaches: Will the regular cast of RHOA welcome the new members...or will the sparks fly? McKinney, 32, is a single mom of a 12-year-old son and former star of Tyler Perry's sitcom House of Payne. Born in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, McKinney has been in a long-term relationship with former Tyler Perry Studios executive Roger Bobb. She has also appeared on shows like Necessary Roughness, The Rickey Smiley Show and Boulevard West, and is working on her first CD. She released a single and music video for a song called  100. 'Bravo is really high on her. She's likeable, works well with the other ladies and is intriguing without contrived drama,' a source close to the network tells MailOnline.  'She has wealth, loves fashion and fine things, and is in a real relationship with a high-powered entertainment executive. Class act: Demetria (left) starred in Tyler Perry's sitcom House of Payne as Janine for six years . Main Squeeze: Demetria McKinney may not be married but she and formerTyler Perry studio executive Roger Bobb are definitely a couple . 'Bravo thinks if NeNe leaves the show after this season she could be the perfect replacement.' NeNe's contract - worth a coll $1m -is up after this season and she's not expected to renew. She has a development deal for a talk show with Debmar-Mercury and wants to focus on acting. 'NeNe's contract is up after this season and she's made it clear she's ready to move on. Her focus is really more centered on her acting work and developing the talk show,' the source told MailOnline.Jordan, 41, is a former The Price is Right and Deal or No Deal model who recently moved to Atlanta to co-host the Rickey Smiley Morning Show syndicated radio program. She doesn't have children and is not in a serious relationship. Most recently, the Providence, Rhode Island-bred host appeared on Donald Trump's ""Celebrity Apprentice All Stars"" where she had a very ugly spat with reality TV vixen Omarosa Manigault. 'Claudia desperately wants to be on this show despite that fact that she doesn't remotely fit the Housewives' format, the source explained. 'She came on the show as a friend of Kenya's but hasn't meshed that well with the others. Show stopper: Claudia was a former Deal or No Deal game show model . Your're fired! The Price is Right host also appeared on Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice All-Stars where she and Omarosa almost came to blows . 'She dresses like a teenage party girl and isn't into fine, southern living, so producers aren't sure that viewers will really connect with her or find her likable.' Critics of the franchise have complained the lack of Southern roots for some of the Housewives and Demetria and Claudia would not be the first.Cynthia Bailey, though married, moved from New York City to join the show. Kenya . Moore flies in from LA to tape & has no man; Kandi Burruss wasn't . married her first 5 seasons; Kim Zolciak was an unmarried mistress for . her first few seasons.

Both Porsha Williams and Kenya Moore began as B Characters who were made permanent. Last season, Natalie Macklin, wife of R&B singer Christopher Williams, and Mynique Smith, wife former NFL player Chuck Smith, are examples of two who didn't make it through they appeared in a few episodes.

"Lightning does strike twice: Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) has been the victim of the same fraud scheme twice in the past decade . It has been revealed that U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) is the victim of an investing scam - and this isn't the first time he's been swindled. Mr Grayson was cheated out of $18million by William Dean Chapman, who cheated a total of 120 people out of $35million in the fraud. The revelations came as Mr Chapman was jailed Monday for 12 years. This is not the first time fraudsters have taken advantage of the Florida Democrat. In 2009,  he won a $34million judgement against a separate firm running a nearly identical fraud. The scheme worked like this: clients . would turn over their stocks to Mr Chapman as collateral for a loan, he would then let customers borrow about 90 per cent of the stocks' value. If the stocks did . badly, borrowers could walk away and keep the money they were loaned. But if the borrowers' stocks did well, they would repay the loan with . interest, and Mr Chapman was supposed to return the stocks to the investor . at their increased value. Mr Grayson's stocks performed . astronomically well while they were entrusted to Mr Chapman and his . company, Alexander Capital Markets. This is where the scheme began to unravel - Mr Chapman sold the stocks and had no way to fulfill his obligations - the self-styled investment guru had no way to make successful investors whole, prosecutors said. 'That's why [Mr Chapman] is going to prison . for a long, long time,' said Mr Grayson. 'At least in the end, some kind . of justice was served.' In most of the court papers, Mr Grayson's identity is protected — prosecutors say only that an elected official with the initials A.G. was the primary victim — but documents twice mention Grayson by name. The Democratic congressman on Monday confirmed he is the A.G. mentioned in the documents. Taken down: William Dean Chapman was charged with fraud after an SEC investigation . Nothing in the court papers suggests Mr Grayson was anything but a victim of the scheme. Lawyers for the congressman said it was the strength of his stocks that caused the scheme to crumble. The two men negotiated a payment plan, according to court records, but it was not enough to keep Mr Chapman's positions from collapsing. In 2007, Grayson had $9.35 million in a . stock portfolio that Chapman was supposed to be holding as collateral. In that year alone, the portfolio's value increased by 147 per cent, to . $23 million, according to a chart in the court documents. 'Because the return on A.G.'s commodities investments were so astronomical, ACM could not meet its obligations under the loan agreements' defense lawyer Whitney Minter wrote. Mr Grayson has a long record of successfully picking stocks, many of which have contributed to his fortune. The con artist instead used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle including a Lamborghini, a Ferrari and a $3 million home, prosecutors said. Mr Chapman, of Sterling, Va., pleaded . guilty in May but tried at Friday's sentencing hearing to withdraw the . plea, saying he felt pressured to plead and that he never intended to . defraud. He is not the first stock scammer to take advantage of Mr Grayson. Double trouble: Mr Grayson also fell for a similar scheme only a few years ago, that once cost him almost twice as much as the latest fraud . In 2009, Mr Grayson won a $34 million judgment after filing a lawsuit in South Carolina under federal racketeering laws against a company called Derivium Capital. Derivium's business plan for hedging an investor's stock profile was nearly identical to the plan outline by Mr Chapman. Mr Grayson said he first entered into deals with Mr Chapman in 2003, well before the deal with Derivium went south, so he had no reason to be suspicious of the arrangement. The loans themselves were a perfectly reasonable way to manage his portfolio, but relied on Mr Chapman and Derivium to hold up their end of the bargain, he said, disputing that the astronomical returns to which he was entitled caused Mr Chapman's downfall. 'If they had not sold the collateral, it all would have worked,' he explained, who is generally listed as one of the 20 wealthiest members of Congress with assets of more than $20 million. His financial disclosure forms list holdings in dozens of stocks. His dealings with Mr Chapman preceded his time in Congress, which began in 2009. Court records indicate Mr Chapman's firm was drawing regulatory scrutiny as early as 2007. Before he was elected to Congress, Mr Grayson practiced law and was best known for winning a major whistleblower lawsuit exposing fraud on a government contract in Iraq.","U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) was one of 120 people who lost a total of $35million in the scheme .

"Sen. Rand Paul and Gov. Chris Christie placed first and second in a straw poll held during this weekend's Northeast Republican Leadership Conference, but Dr. Ben Carson may have stolen the show without being a candidate for anything. He emerged in third place with 11 per cent support, tied with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Paul led them by less than four points, with 14.7 per cent support. Christie polled 13 per cent. A 'draft committee' intent on sparking Carson to run for the White House in 2016 raised more than $2.8 million in its first six months of existence. That's more than double what the 'Ready For Hillary' group raised in its initial half-year, even though Hillary Clinton's candidacy seems far more assured than Carson's. Dr. Ben Carson, professor emeritus at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, has become a quiet force in the 2016 Republican presidential race without announcing a thing . The group angling to persuade Carson to make a White House run brought activists to support him at CPAC, near D.C., in large numbers, but fared even better in a smaller New Hampshire setting without the extra muscle . Why they fight: New England Republicans mocked their favorite Democratic villains during the two-day conference in Nashua, N.H. The top two poll slots at the smallish event that concluded Saturday in Nashua, N.H. mirrored those of a statewide Suffolk University/Boston Herald poll released on March 6. Christie and Paul were tied with 12 per cent support each in that earlier poll, a tiny level of backing that shows how wide open the 2016 GOP presidential nomination race is. The top vote-getter, in reality, was 'undecided.' Clinton, by contrast, typically dominates the Democrats' prospective 2016 field, leading all comers by 40 points or more. Carson was not included on the Suffolk pollsters' list. He polled 9 per cent – good enough for another third-place finish – in a straw poll at this month's Conservative Political Action Conference. But Paul dominated and won for the second straight year, with a 31 per cent showing. CPAC is a a much larger gathering dominated by insurgent tea party-aligned activists, which included remarks from Carson. But unlike the hyper-conservative event, which banned Chris Christie last year over his embrace of Barack Obama following super storm Sandy, just 29 per cent of the Nashua event's attendees said they identified with the 5-year-old right-wing tea party movement. Polling few enough votes to be lumped into the catch-all 'other' category was MSNBC morning show host and former congressman Joe Scarborough, whose presidential trial balloons have largely popped amid Republicans' concerns about his 2012 change of heart on gun control. Scarborough spoke Saturday morning and had little to show for it but a few book sales. Carson made big waves despite being nearly a continent away in Montana, speaking to a crowd of 1,300 at the Flathead County Fairgrounds in an event hosted by a Christian school. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (L) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) placed #1 and #2 in the Northeast Republican Leadershpi Council straw poll, with a trip including Ben Carson nipping at their heels . The results: Rand Paul and Christie on top, Ben Carson in a surprising tie for third, and Joe Scarborough nowhere to be found . Red meat: Confernce attendees in New Hampshire were treated to a seemingly endless supply of political fire-stoking materials and anti-Obama one-liners . 'I think the biggest issue facing us today is we've abandoned God,' he said there Friday night. 'I think the second biggest problem is we've become selfish. Nobody got that upset about [Operation] Fast and Furious. Nobody got that upset about Benghazi, NSA, IRS,' he went on, rattling off a series of President Barack Obama's most confidence-rattling scandals. 'But they got upset about Obamacare because that affected them personally.' Unconventional warfare: 2,000 hotel guests attending the CPAC convention this month received key cards featuring Carson's face and the draft-friendly 'Run Ben Run!' sogan . In what sounded like the beginnings of a campaign speech, Carson directly attacked Democratic Party messaging. 'They say there's a war on women - give me a break! - racial wars, age wars, income wars, wherever they can drive a wedge into any crack,' Carson said. 'It's much easier to manipulate small groups than it is a whole population.' 'What is going to be necessary is we the people of the United States have to wake up and realize we are being manipulated and we are not each other's enemies. Those enemies are the people who are trying to manipulate us. We need to learn how to identify them. In cases where they are public officials we need to vote them out of office.' Vernon Robinson, campaign director with the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, told MailOnline that his pick 'is the only guy who can broaden the base of the GOP by getting a bunch more minority votes. ... he's the only guy who can heal the country.' Carson has become a lightning rod in the past year, beginning in early 2013 when he delivered health care-related remarks at a National Prayer Breakfast – with President Obama just feet away on the dais – that were openly hostile to the Obamacare program. At the prayer breakfast, Carson warned about the historical lessons of civilizations that 'destroyed themselves from within.' 'Moral decay. Fiscal irresponsibility. They destroyed themselves,' he said. 'And if you don't think that can happen to America, you get out your books and you start reading.' Partly because of that speech, Johns Hopkins University withdrew his invitation to speak at its 2013 commencement exercises. Carson is professor emeritus at the university's famed medical school. No mistaking it: The Republican Party has to respond to the Obama phenomenon by drafting a candidate who can boost GOP minority voting, says Carson 'draft' leader Vernon Robinson . Robinson said Carson doesn't . coordinate messaging or scheduling with his organization. But as the . renowned surgeon's name gains national traction, he hasn't discouraged . the 'draft' movement either. The result, he said, is a maybe-candidacy with serious heft. 'He came out very close to where Chris Christie was, and the event was in his back yard, run by his guys,' Robinson explained. Matt Mowers, a former Christie campaign aide, is now executive director of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee, which put on the Nashua event. The poll of 223 attendees, which does not necessarily scientifically represent Republican voters, was conducted by WPA Opinion Research. Participants included 65-percent men. A separate 68 per cent were residents of New Hampshire, which will hold the nation's first presidential primary elections. 'What this survey tells is that is that no one candidate has really separated themselves from the potential field in 2016,' said WPA vice president Ryan Steusloff. 'At this point, the nomination is completely up-for-grabs and of the would-be contenders, no one can be ruled out just yet.' Enthusiasm: 'Run, Ben, Run!' mini-banners were available at CPAC and the New Hampshire event .","Carson, a conservative African-American neurosurgeon, isn't a candidate for any office .

"The wealthiest Members of Congress got even wealthier last year, a comprehensive analysis of their finances released on Monday night revealed. The 50 richest Congressmen and women reported a minimum net worth of at least $7.4 million in 2013, Roll Call discovered in it's review.

Source: Roll Call . Another Republican, Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, ranked ranked no. 2 on the list in 2013 with a minimum net worth of $117.54 million. McCaul is not independently wealthy, Roll Call points out. Nearly all of the assets listed on the Texas Representatives' financial disclosure form are in his wife Linda's name. McCaul's wife is the daughter of the founder of Clear Channel Communications. Issa and McCaul were the only Republicans to make the top 10 richest lawmakers list. Rounding at the top-tier of the list were: Maryland Rep. John Delaney, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, Colorado Rep. Jared Polis, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, California Rep. Scott Peters, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Washington Rep. Susan DelBene. Republicans were more financially successful than Democrats overall, however, with 30 Republican lawmakers rising to the cream of the crop compared to only 20 Democrats. White, male members of Congress were also more likely to be wealthy than their colleagues. Just nine women made this year's 50 richest list. And every one of the most well-off members of Congress was white. While the Senate is considered the more prestigious of the legislative chambers two chamber, the members of Congress who have the most were more likely to serve in the House of Representatives. A mere 15 Senators made this year's list. CQ Roll Call has analyzing lawmakers' financial disclosure forms and rank ordering them since 1990. The news organization determines how much each member is approximately worth by subtracting the total minimum amount of their reported liabilities from the total minimum amount of their reported assets. Roll Call is unable to break down each members exact net worth because federal financial disclosure forms allow them to ascribe a value range to assets. Furthermore, members don't have to list the value of their homes, only the price of their mortgages. They also don't have to say how much money they've invested in their federal retirement funds. Roll Call tries to keep the playing field as fair as possible by assuming the lowest amount of liabilities for a member within the reported range, as well as the lowest amount of assets. In addition to calculating which members of Congress have the most wealth, Roll Call determined which Members of Congress had the lowest net worth. Because mortgages are listed as liabilities on federal forms and home values are not listed as assets, many of the poorest Members of Congress have negative net worth despite owning more than one home. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for example, has a net worth of -$972,000 even though she has two homes. Contributing to the Florida Representative's negative ranking is a $250,000 home equity line of credit and a personal bank loan of more than $100,000. The Democratic Party official and her husband are also carrying $15,000 in credit card debt, Roll Call discovered. The Congressmen and women that made Roll Call's list of poorest lawmakers -  in order of how much they had in liabilities in 2013 - were: California Rep. David Valadao, Florida Reps. Alcee Hastings and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, California Reps. Buck McKeon and Dana Rohrabacher, Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley, New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, Pennsylvania Rep. Chaka Fattah and Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise.","The richest 50 had a minimum net worth of $7.4 million or above .

"He is ‘excited and charged’ by his new multi-million dollar job with the Weather Channel. But Sam Champion feels betrayed by people inside ABC whom he considered ‘friends’ after a string of ‘mean-spirited digs’ following his exit from Good Morning America, MailOnline can reveal today. A source close to the star said:  ‘Sam was with ABC for 25 years, when he did the goodbye show at GMA he felt good about walking out the door. ‘But . then came these digs by people that throughout his career he would have . called friends and he doesn’t understand why – or what’s in it for . anybody. Scroll down for video . 'This is a lot harder than I thought it would be': Champion bid a tearful farewell to his Good Morning America team on December 4 . Champion and Elliott hugged it out at the end of the show as they said a tearful goodbye on December 4 . The former weatherman on the hit ABC . breakfast show made his last on-air appearance just six days ago and . hugged co-star Robin Roberts while Josh Elliot wept during his emotional . exit. However, since his . departure, Sam, 52, has been subjected to reports he is power crazed – . and that he left ABC purely as a money-making venture. And . a source close to Sam revealed the attacks are upsetting during a . particularly ‘joyous’ time in his career – adding he is particularly . upset that his husband Rubem Robierb has been dragged into it. Sam’s new job makes him the on-air . face of the Weather Channel, based in Atlanta, appearing as host and . serving as Managing Editor. ‘He had his first . day at the Weather Channel yesterday and he’s excited and charged and . had the best day ever and these ridiculous stories don’t make any sense . at all,' said the source. While Robin Roberts, 53, . has recently signed a massive new deal with ABC, TV chiefs are . currently negotiating new contracts with GMA stars Josh Elliot, Lara Spencer and . George Stephanopoulos – all of whom have deals up within the year, . leaving the network in somewhat of a perilous situation at the top-rated morning show in the U.S. Sam has kept in touch . with ‘one or two’ of his GMA pals since leaving, but the friend said: . ‘There’s a lot going on with them and they are in negotiations, he wants . to step away while there is this negative gossip. ‘His . tactic is that he needs to focus on his new job. And he wants them to . make the best decisions for their lives and careers. ‘ . Sam Champion has been with the ABC network since 1988 as weather host . For . Sam, according to his friend, what is upsetting are reports that ABC . were lining up his replacement Ginger Zee months ago as they believed he . was unhappy at the network. However, . the source said: ‘Here’s the thing, Sam’s contract with ABC was up at . the very end of November. He went to ABC in late summer and said ‘let’s . start talking’ as he wanted to know he had a future at the network . ‘They didn’t start talking until the first few weeks of November, which is when the Weather Channel deal came up. ‘It wasn’t a long-range plan, it wasn’t anything that had been going on for a year, that’s just not true. ‘He . never saw the opportunity coming, but this is what he loves, he tried . for years to convince the network that weather is news and it’s . important. ‘The Weather Channel already knows this and they want to more. Sam thought ABC understood this.‘He told them he would try to make everyone happy and make everyone look good.’ The . source added: ‘It was joyous for Sam, he didn’t see why anyone should . feel bad – he went and told everyone he loved them and walked out the . door and the next morning comes this mean-spirited attack, like being . punched.’ Attacking claims . that he merely wanted to leave in an exercise to be able to licence his . image on products like coffee mugs, the source insisted: ‘Sam’s deal . with ABC wasn’t exclusive. ‘If he had wanted to licence merchandise he would have - all he needed was ABC’s approval. ‘He didn’t bolt to make all kinds of crazy money.’ Sad goodbyes: Champion (far right) bid farewell to the rest of the GMA team on December 4 (L-R) Josh Elliott, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Lara Spencer . Upset: Sam Champion is said to be most upset his husband Rubem Robierb had been used in digs against him since leaving ABC. The couple are seen on their honeymoon . And . discussing rumours that Sam’s husband Rubem, 36, had persuaded him to . leave GMA as he refused to leave his hometown of Miami – so they could . start a family , the source said: ‘It’s not fair to bring Rubem into it. ‘He would never have demanded that Sam leave ABC, if they were going to have babies Sam would be on the same schedule. ‘Rubem had never even been to Atlanta before yesterday.' Ironically, in his new role, Sam . now joins forces with his former rival, Today weather co-host Al Roker, . whose one-hour Wake Up With Al airs on The Weather Channel weekdays at . 6am (EST), then repeats at 10am. Champion's new morning show will be tucked in between, airing from 7 to 10am. And Sam will also be in the partial employ (in a sense) of his old . network rival: The Weather Channel is owned by a consortium made up in . part of NBC Universal. But interestingly, . the first person to send Sam a text of support when he announced his . departure from GMA was Mr Roker. Champion was in fits of laughter as tapes from the ABC archives were brought back to haunt him on his last day on GMA . Sam Champion and Josh Elliott became very emotional as they said goodbye on their last breakfast show together . Ginger Zee, who was on the ground in Denver, Colorado, on December 4 to cover the severe winter storm, has taken over from Champion as weather presenter at GMA . Al, . 59,  who hosts Wake Up With Al on the Weather Channel and sent a text . saying ‘Congratulations, you’re going to love this place!’ The . pair already plan lunch when Sam’s back in New York City and the source . said: ‘They’ve known each other for 25 years, Sam knows Al’s wife and . family and they socialise together. ‘Sam is not going to Today, he’s doing a 2/3 hour breakfast show on the Weather Channel. ‘‘Sam . doesn’t understand why ABC can’t be happy for him – they have a great . show, great talent and they don’t need to dig at him.

"Rep. Kevin McCarthy was voted the next House Majority Leader on Thursday as fellow Republicans shuffled their leadership in the wake of Rep. Eric Cantor's primary defeat in Virginia. McCarthy, 49, triumphed over Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho to continue his rapid rise through the leadership ranks. The totals of the secret ballot election were not immediately disclosed. The California representative had been serving as his party's whip, or chief vote counter, since Republicans took control of Congress in 2011. His ascension set up a three-way election to fill his current spot in the leadership, involving Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Peter Roskam of Illinois and Marlin Stutzman of Indiana. Scalise, 28, came out the victor for that position in a quick, single ballot vote, making him the House's third-highest ranking Republican. Scroll down for video . Meet the new House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy: McCarthy defeated fellow Republican Rep. Raul Labrador for the position in today's leadership race . Rep. Steve Scalise, who leads a conservative of group of lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee, arrives with his GOP House allies to cast ballots for new party leaders this afternoon. Scalise was elected to fill the whip position being vacated by McCarthy . At a press conference after the vote, McCarthy said, 'I will work every single day to . make sure this conference has the courage to lead with the wisdom to . listen. And we'll turn this country around.' Likewise, Scalise told reporters, 'We've got solid conservative solutions that are gonna solve the problems facing our country.' The elections followed a brief campaign set in motion little more than a week ago, when Cantor, the current majority leader, lost his primary election to little-known, underfunded tea party-backed challenger David Brat. The day after the primary, Cantor resigned from his position in Republican leadership, effective July 31, and endorsed his close friend McCarthy to lead in his stead. McCarthy, moved quickly to line up the votes for majority leader in the wake of Cantor's defeat at the polls in Virginia, deploying an organization developed since he became whip more than three years ago when Republicans took control of the House. One potential rival, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, decided against joining the race, while another, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, deferred to a second Texan, Rep. Pete Sessions. Sessions quickly dropped out, though, saying it was obvious that a successful campaign would have created painful divisions within the party. Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho jumped in, but by then, the California front-runner had amassed support from across the rank and file. Labrador's inability to corral members of his state's Republican Party at a convention last weekend, of which he was the chair, also undercut his argument that he he could effectively lead House Republicans. Rep. Raul Labrador, right, pictured walking through a basement corridor on Capitol Hill yesterday before a meeting of the House Republican Conference, also threw his name in the ring for Majority Leader, but ultimately McCarthy came out on top . McCarthy was aided not only by personal ties, but by the fundraising prowess he has displayed since joining the leadership. His Majority Committee PAC gave nearly $1.2 million to Republican House candidates and organizations during the two-year election cycle of 2011-2012, and an additional $480,000 to candidates so far in advance of this fall's balloting. 'Given the one week duration of this race, there’s really not a credible way of mounting a really serious challenger campaign because you have to engage the outside forces and do all the other nuts and bolts of politics which is really difficult to do in a week,' Republican Rep. Mark Sanford told Buzzfeed on Wednesday. 'I’d say if conservatives are frustrated in November, I would argue there’s a much greater shot of making a change at that point because you’d have time in which to do so.' Conservatives at the non-profit political outfit FreedomWorks weren't deterred by their candidate's loss in today's election for that exact reason. 'Rep. Labrador’s impressive performance is indicative of a growing liberty caucus that is ready to make a policy agenda of individual liberty and fiscal responsibility a priority in the House,' FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe said in a statement. 'We are looking forward to an even bigger group of liberty leadership candidates after the elections in November.” Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor will stay Majority Leader until July 31 . If . McCarthy's ascension seemed a foregone conclusion, the battle to take . his whip's spot was anything but — so much so that there was speculation . that a second ballot might be required to settle the contest. Congressional . leadership races are traditionally contests that turn on personal . relationships, geographical considerations, ideology and more. Inside . the current GOP rank-and-file, moderates needed not apply. Instead, the . various candidates stressed their conservative credentials. In the end, Scalise, a Louisiana Congressman who won his seat in a special election in 2008, knocked out his opponents in one round. Roskam, . 52, will stay in the position directly below Scalise as chief deputy whip. The fourth-term congressman had sought to move . up the leadership ladder among a group of politicians that often prefers . breaking precedent rather than following it. But Scalise's argument that the House needed a red-state, conservative Republican in the top -tier of leadership proved effective. In setting quick elections, Speaker . John Boehner and other leaders hoped to avoid a drawn-out, divisive . struggle that might complicate the party's drive to retain its majority . in midterm balloting on Nov. 4. Boehner may have a whole other set of problems on his hands now, though, as Scalise, who heads the conservative Republican Study Committee, is slated to become his chief vote wrangler. The RSC has sometimes served as a conservative thorn in the side of leadership in the past, straying from party-line votes when it felt leadership was compromising too much with the other side. With Scalise helping to run the show, conservatives and Tea Partiers will be more empowered than they were before to stop legislation they disagree with from getting to the floor. Scalise received a 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union in 2013, meaning he voted along conservative lines on every single piece of legislation that was important to the right-wing of the party. By comparison, the average House Republican ACU rating in 2013 was 76.48 percent. Labrador also received a 100 percent rating in 2013, while Boehner scored an 86.99 rating and McCarthy a 90.42. Despite Scalise's conservative credentials, right-leaning groups stayed out of today's whip race, with Freedomworks' Kibbe saying either 'Stutzman or Scalise would be an upgrade' from past leadership.","Eric Cantor, the number two Republican in the House of Representatives, lost his primary last week in an upset election .

"House Republicans have . passed legislation to shut down a program by President Barack Obama . granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as . kids, with many calling the bill a dead-end as the Senate leaves for summer break. The legislation that passed 216-192 late . Friday could put more than 700,000 immigrants who've received temporary . work permits in line for deportation. It also would block Obama from awarding work permits to other immigrants here illegally. House Republicans have passed legislation to shut down a program by President Barack Obama granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as kids . The . bill was supported by conservatives who demanded it as their price for . backing a separate measure dealing with the crisis of unaccompanied . minors flooding the border. The Senate has already adjourned for Congress' summer recess so neither bill stands a chance of becoming law. As CBS notes, President Barack Obama and Senate Democracts have said they won't even consider said legislation. Obama called the move political theater 'just so they can check a box before they're leaving town for a month. A day after . GOP leaders pulled the border bill from the floor in a chaotic retreat, . tea party lawmakers were enthusiastically on board with the new $694 . million version and a companion measure that would shut off a program . created by Obama granting work permits to immigrants brought here . illegally as kids. The second bill also seemed designed to prevent the . more than 700,000 people who've already gotten work permits under the . program from renewing them, ultimately making them subject to . deportation. The spending bill passed 223-189 . late Friday, with only four Republicans voting ""no"" and one Democrat . voting 'yes.' A vote on the second measure was expected later in the . night. 'It's dealing with the issue that the . American people care about more than any other, and that is stopping the . invasion of illegal foreign nationals into our country,' said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. 'And we got to yes.' But . Obama said no. 'They're not even trying to solve the problem,' the . president said. 'I'm going to have to act alone, because we do not have . enough resources.' Obama said he would . reallocate resources where he could, while making clear his options were . limited without congressional action. The . moves in the House came on what was to have been the first day of . lawmakers' five-week summer recess, delayed by GOP leaders after their . vote plans unexpectedly collapsed on Thursday. Senators had already left . Washington after killing their own legislation on the border crisis, so . there was no prospect of reaching a final deal. Rep. Steven King of Iowa, a leading immigration hardliner, said he was 'very satisfied' with the results . But three months before . midterm elections, House Republicans were determined to show that they, . at least, could take action to address the crisis involving tens of . thousands of unaccompanied minors fleeing violence and poverty in . Central America to cross illegally into South Texas. 'It . would be irresponsible and unstatesmanlike to head home for the month . without passing a bill to address this serious, present crisis on the . border,' said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the Appropriations . Committee. To reach a deal, GOP leaders had to . satisfy the demands of a group of a dozen or more conservative . lawmakers who were meeting behind the scenes with Sens. Ted Cruz, . R-Texas, and Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and taking their cues from outside . groups such as the Heritage Foundation that opposed earlier versions of . the legislation. These lawmakers objected to . sending any more money to Obama without a strong stance against his . two-year-old deportation relief program, which Republicans blame for . causing the current border crisis by creating the perception that once . here, young migrants would be allowed to stay - a point the . administration disputes. House GOP leaders . agreed earlier in the week to hold a separate vote to prevent Obama from . expanding the deportation relief program, but that didn't satisfy . conservatives who held out for stronger steps. Thursday . night, those lawmakers huddled in the basement of the Capitol with new . House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., until coming up with a deal . ending funding for the deportation relief program as well as making . changes to the border bill aimed at ensuring the faster removal of the . Central American migrant youths. Friday morning, as the full Republican caucus met in the Capitol, conservative lawmakers were declaring victory. 'I'm very satisfied,' said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, the leading immigration hardliner in the House. In . the end Republicans only lost four of the most conservative members on . the vote: Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Paul Broun of Georgia, . Stephen Fincher of Tennessee and Walter Jones of North Carolina. Rep. Michele Bachmann called 'stopping the invasion of illegal foreign nationals' the issue Americans care about most . The . only Democrat to support the bill was moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar of . Texas. The GOP plans met with howls of protest . from immigration advocates and Democrats, who warned Republicans that . they'd be alienating Latino voters for years to come. 'If . you tell people that you think they're criminals, that you think . they're simply bringing diseases, that they're bringing drugs, then you . treat them as invaders, they kind of think you don't like them,' said . Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. 'They're going to believe you don't like . them, and they're not going to vote for you.' The . new GOP border bill adds $35 million more for the National Guard, which . would go to reimburse states for guard deployments. Like earlier . versions, it would increase spending for overwhelmed border agencies, . add more immigration judges and detention spaces, and alter a 2008 . anti-trafficking law to permit Central American kids to be sent back . home without deportation hearings. That process is currently permitted . only for unaccompanied minors arriving from Mexico and Canada. The . bill would pay for strapped border agencies only for the final two . months of this budget year, falling far short of the $3.7 billion Obama . initially requested to deal with the crisis into next year. More than . 57,000 unaccompanied youths have arrived since October, mostly from El .

"A twisted sadist has been jailed after he bred dogs to hunt down and kill foxes and badgers so he could film it for a sick thrill. Richard Atkins from Newhall in Derbyshire has been sentenced to 24 weeks behind bars after a photo showed him smiling with glee as he held a still live fox by the throat. The 45-year-old, who captured the stomach-churning acts carried out by his dogs for posterity on video, admitted nine charges when he appeared at Burton upon Trent Magistrates Court on Friday. Shocking: Smiling at the camera sick Richard Atkins caught himself . red-handed in this snap that has seen him jailed for using his dogs to . hunt and kill foxes and badgers . The court was told by the RSPCA’s prosecution team that Atkins was responsible for 'incredibly malicious and sadistic cruelty to animals.' In addition to his prison sentence of nearly six months Atkins also received a lifetime ban on keeping all animals and the forfeiture of all his dogs and equipment used for baiting and hunting. The nine charges he admitted included causing animals to fight, keeping dogs for the purpose of animal fighting, causing unnecessary suffering and animal welfare offences. Inspectors from the RSPCA’s special operations unit spent two years investigating him. Appalling: Atkins, 45, trained his hounds to hunt down and attack wild animals. He then filmed the sickening attacks on a digital video camera which he showed to his pals . They were able to successfully bring the prosecution to court when forensic examination of badger baiting footage seized from a digital video camera proved a voice heard in the background was that of Atkins. The court saw graphic footage of Atkins’s black Patterdale terrier and bull lurcher type dog carrying out attacks on two badgers and a fox in separate incidents in 2010. In another clip a badger is seen having its leg torn off, while men - including Atkins - can be heard laughing in the background. As well as the harrowing clips which showed the wild animals being attacked, the dogs used by Atkins also suffered sickening injuries during the attacks. The defendant admitted that he would attempt to treat his dogs’ injuries at home, rather than take them to a vet and raise suspicion. Both the Patterdale terrier and bull lurcher seen in the footage were found at Atkins’ home when a warrant was carried out by police and the RSPCA in March last year. Brutal: A badger is caught in the teeth of two of Atkins' dogs as he carries out one of his nighttime baiting sessions . Defenceless: The animal tries to escape but has no chance against the powerful jaws of the two hounds . Barbarous: As one of the dogs continues to hold the badger's neck, the second attacks the bottom half of his body and one of the animal's legs is torn off . The Patterdale terrier had suffered huge injuries to its jaw and it was partially blind in one eye. Four other dogs - also believed to have been bred for fighting and hunting - were seized during the warrant, along with paraphernalia, digging equipment and search lights. Chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA’s special operations unit said: 'An enormous amount of time and effort was put into this investigation by our officers and prosecutions team. 'However, it makes it all worthwhile when you see someone like Atkins- who was responsible for such abhorrent levels of animal cruelty - admit the charges. 'After all of my years working in animal welfare, I still find it shocking that someone would deliberately go into the countryside with their dogs, with the sole intention of inflicting unimaginable suffering on a wild animal for their own twisted pleasure. 'It is even sadder knowing that, there are many others who are still doing this sort of thing in England and Wales to this very day. 'Make no mistake though, we will continue to track them down and the next knock on their door could be from us.'","Richard Atkins jailed after admitting nine charges of animal cruelty .

"Michael Schumacher is 'waking up very slowly' following the skiing accident which left him with horrific brain injuries, it emerged today. The news of his slow recovery was passed on by the Schumacher's 15-year-old son Mick, a kart-racing driver. The 45-year-old is being treated at home after spending six months in a medically-induced coma following the accident in Meribel, France, in December last year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Schumacher in action during his Ferrari days . Formula One legend Michael Schumacher (left) is 'waking up very slowly', his son Mick, 15, (right) has revealed . Kart-racing driver Mick (pictured) told French F1 commentator Jean-Louis Moncet that things are going 'at a slow pace' French F1 commentator Jean-Louis Moncet told Europe 1 radio station: 'I saw his son and he told me that Schumi is waking up very slowly; very slowly. 'Although things are going at a slow pace, he has a lot of time, I would say he has his whole life in front of him to get back on track.' Moncet, 69, also cast new light on the manner in which Schumacher was injured when he  struck a rock during the fall. 'The problem for Michael was not the hit, but the mounting of the Go-Pro camera that he had on his helmet that injured his brain,' said Moncet. Moncet confirmed that Schumacher was still 'fighting' at his Swiss mansion, where he is being cared for in a purpose-built medical suite. The seven times world champion returned to his home with his wife and children two months ago after being discharged from a rehabilitation clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Schumacher spent time in the rehab clinic after coming out of his medically-induced coma following the accident, which left him with catastrophic brain injuries. Updates on his condition have been few and far between. After he was moved home, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said there was a 'long and difficult' road ahead. Former Ferrari boss Jean Todt visited Schumacher last month, saying: 'What's important is that he lives and that his family is with him. We really believe that things will get better. He needs time and to be left alone. Accident: Schumacher, pictured with wife Corinna, suffered severe brain injuries after a ski accident in December last year and was put in a medically induced coma . 'In the past weeks and months, he has made progress in relation to the severity of his injury,' said Todt, now president of the International Automobile Federation. 'But a long and hard road is in front of him. Hopefully things will improve. His family is close to him. He needs time and peace.' Schumacher is being cared for by a team of 15 experts at his home. It is understood he remains immobile and unable to speak. His care is estimated to be costing his family 100,000 pounds per month. At the end of the year his father Rolf is moving from his home in Germany into a specially constructed residence built for him in the grounds of the 35 million pound Schumacher mansion at Gland, on the shores of Lake Geneva. Mick has been tipped to follow in his father's footsteps in his own motorsport career. The 15-year-old finished runner-up at the world championships in France last month, before coming second again in the German junior kart championships last week. Having raced under the surname of Betsch, his mother Corinna's maiden name, Mick Schumacher adopted the name Mick Jnr this season.

"French president Francois Hollande is back enjoying secret trysts with an actress almost 20 years his junior, it emerged today. News of the Socialist head of state’s renewed love affair with Julie Gayet, 41, emerged as he tried to save his floundering career with a make-or-break television appearance. As he appeared on a 90 minute broadcast on TF1, a French magazine was releasing pictures of Ms Gayet being driven in and out of the back entrance of the Elysee Palace. French president Francois Hollande (pictured) is back enjoying secret trysts with an actress almost 20 years his junior, it emerged today . News of the Socialist head of state’s renewed love affair with Julie Gayet (pictured) emerged as he tried to save his floundering career with a make-or-break TV appearance . It follows the pair being sensational caught out in January, spending the night in a government flat round the corner from the presidential palace in Paris. Mr Hollande, 60, was infamously pictured on the back of a moped, as he used a crash helmet to try and disguise his identify. But he was caught out, and then effectively fired his live-in first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, who promptly checked herself into hospital suffering from a nervous breakdown. Last night, Mr Hollande was asked about his secret affair with Ms Gayet, and claims by Ms Trierweiler that he is a compulsive liar and a love cheat. Mr Hollande calmly replied: ‘If I made mistakes, I recognise them. There are pains, and I forgive them.’ But his ambiguous – not to say confusing – reply did not mention the VSD magazine revelations, which are today on news-stands all over France, and on the web. ‘It’s started again,’ is the VSD headline, and its report says the pair now regularly meet at the Elysee itself. Last night, Mr Hollande (left) was asked about his secret affair with Ms Gayet, and claims by Valerie Trierweiler (right) that he is a compulsive liar and a love cheat . The photos are the first evidence that Ms Gayet is actually staying at the presidential palace, and there are even claims that she has her own bodyguard. The photographs were taken on October 30th, when the TV actress returned to Paris after taking part in Tokyo Film Festival. VSD says that Gayet tries to throw photographers off the scent by having a driver approach from different routes, and always enters via a stately back gate. Asked whether his secret trysts with Ms Gayet had debased the institution of the presidency, Mr Hollande said in the TV interview: ‘I think the responsibility is collective. I don’t want to shirk my responsibilities but there comes a time when one must respect private life.’ Ms Trierweiler, a Paris Match magazine journalist, has written a kiss-and-tell bestseller about Mr Hollande’s deceit, portraying him as a heartless hypocrite. The President, who has four grown up children with his ecology minister, Segolene Royal, is officially single, and his press office would not comment on the VSD photos. The latest opinion polls show Mr Hollande’s popularity at a record low of 12 per cent, and his hopes of re-election in 2017 have all but ended.","Francois Hollande back enjoying secret trysts with actress, it has emerged .

"Wearing colourful baggy trousers, and smiling widely behind his face paint, Bozo the clown appears in front of a group of school children and cries: 'Do you want to play?' He looks just like an innocent entertainer but second later 'Bozo' screeches like a maniac and - as the pupils flee in horror - chases them into a nearby park brandishing a gun and a sharpened stick. This is no Halloween prank, but the face of a disturbing new trend sweeping America and Europe: clown terror attacks inspired by US serial killer Twisty the Clown. For the first time MailOnline can reveal who is behind the macabre craze - a 19-year-old butcher's apprentice who developed a sinister obsession with the circus act. Teenager Thomas Van Becelaert, who now has a criminal conviction for premeditated violence with a weapon, marauded through the town of Douvrin, northern France. He is one of dozens of students, teenagers and schoolchildren as young as 14 who have become consumed by the 'evil clown' phenomenon. Freaky: A sinister clown craze sweeping France has seen dozens of teenagers don costumes and terrorise children. Prank group Clowns of the North boast of stunts like this in Douai, northern France . Twisted: The macabre craze is said to be inspired by serial killer Twisty the Clown from the TV series American Horror Story . Ashamed: Apprentice butcher Thomas Van Becelaert can now be revealed as one of the clowns terrorising children in Douvrin, northern France . The mania has escalated to such a degree that vigilante mobs have formed in France to chase away the clowns and the village of Vendargues, in the south of the country, has just placed an official ban on ‘evil clowns’. Mayor Bruno Giraudo said: ‘It's about protecting children by preventing ill-intentioned clowns threatening residents.’ The sinister movement started in the US, mainly thanks to TV series called ‘American Horror Story: Freak Show’, which centres on the serial killer Twisty the Clown. The fictional character stalks couples with scissors and imprisons children in an old school bus. Now however it has spread to Europe, where police in France have been forced to issue a warning against vigilante mobs, stating: 'Any person, aggressive clowns or hunters of clowns, discovered in possession of a weapon on the highway will be arrested.' Police arrested 14 teenagers dressed as clowns and carrying weapons in the Mediterranean port town of Agde on October 25. But because they are underage they cannot be identified - and Van Beclaert is the only attacker who can be named and shamed so far. He had a record for ‘minor offences’ around his home town, and had developed a ‘fascination’ with clowns, said a legal source close to the case. The source added: ‘He became obsessed with this craze. It started off as a means of bullying younger kids, which is bad enough, but it has turned into something even more sinister.’ Van Becelaert himself, who got away with a six month suspended sentence, 105 hours community service, and a ban on carrying any kind of weapon for five years, said: ‘I know it wasn’t funny, I’m just really sorry.’ Sinister: The craze started in California, while in Britain a clown was spotted in Northampton (above) but did not terrorise children. Police in France have now issued an appeal against vigilante mobs . Armed: At a court appearance Thomas Van Becelaert confessed to carrying an air pistol that looked like a live ammunition gun to target children . During his appearance at a court in Béthune last week, Van Becelaert admitted heading out at twilight on a Friday night in early October. He was wearing a wig, burnt cork smeared across his face, and multi-coloured clothing picked up in a novelty shop. An air pistol looking just like a live ammunition gun and the heavy stick were his chosen arms. Despite Van Becelaert’s apology, and his considerable efforts to avoid identification in court, the so-called 'Clowns of the North' gang to which he belonged continue to cause terror across the region. They carry anything they can lay their hands on – from chainsaws and axes to knives and baseball bats. Fake blood and dummies are often used to make the attacks even more chilling. Van Becelaert would not expand on what motivated his crimes, but his tearful mother, Christelle Van Becelaert, was prepared to offer her version of events. ‘My son disguised himself as a clown as joke for his mates,’ she told MailOnline. ‘He went out, unarmed, without anything. ‘He picked up a stick in the park, where there were a lot of young people. He made them scared, that’s certain, but he had no weapon with him, never.’ Referring to the owner of a fast food van who confronted her son, Mrs Van Becelaert said: ‘The chip fryer came round to our house with a weapon. It was then that my son panicked and returned home. Macabre: Mystery clowns that are terrorizing California towns at night have started carrying guns in a movement that has spread to Europe . Copycat: Clowns allegedly carrying guns have been seen in California in a frightening attempt to copy the activities of Twisty the Clown, from the US series American Horror Story . ‘I’ve got an airgun that fires tear gas pellets. My son was scared so he went out with it, but there was no premeditation.’ Mrs Van Becelaert claimed Thomas was being punished unfairly. ‘My fear is that he is suffering because of what all the other clowns have been doing,’ she said. However, Mrs Van Becelaert conceded: ‘I want to shake him, to make him understand that he shouldn’t have done that to kids.’ She admits that the first person her son came across was a six-year-old living next door, and he is still traumatised by what he saw. The chilling events in Douvrin, not far from France’s border with Belgium, have been replicated dozens of times in recent weeks. Police have stepped up patrols in a bid to clamp down on the craze, one which has led to a series of disturbing attacks. The Clowns of the North have their own Facebook page, with a main page reading: ‘Just for Fun’. A member who lives in the town of Amiens, and who asked solely to be referred to as Gilles, said: ‘It’s a cool craze which comes from America – it’s the mixture of fun and mischief which really appeals to us. ‘We stand there with balloons and a happy look on our face and then – bang – we’re scaring people out of their skins! ‘It does no real harm – the fake weapons used aren’t meant to hurt anyone. We’d much rather just make a funny video and stick it online’. Creepy: The trend spread to Northampton where budding film-maker Alex Powell posted images of himself on Facebook - but insisted he was not harming anyone . But Thierry Alonso, the director of public safety in the Pas-de-Calais region, said Van Becelaert’s arrest and conviction should send out the right message. ‘This kind of behaviour just isn’t acceptable,’ said Mr Alonso. ‘There’s been a domino effect, with lots of people getting involved all over France. When there is aggression, real or simulated, this behaviour just isn’t allowed.’ Mr Alonso said a lot of the worst violence happened when people fought back. There have already been a number of vigilante attacks. In Montpellier, a fake clown beat someone up with an iron bar, while drivers in the city have complained of ‘very scary clowns’ threatening them. A French video of a man dressed as a clown pretending to club people to death in front of terrified passers-by has had almost 30 million hits. Twisty the Clown, from the US series American Horror Story, is known to have influenced France's fake clowns. So too has the case of American serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy, who was executed in 1994 for murdering 33 people. Gacy regularly dressed up as a funny man for children’s parties, and became known as the ‘Killer Clown’. ‘There nothing fun about any of this,’ said one of the police officers who dealt with Van Becelaert’s case. 'It’s a sinister craze, and it’s getting out of hand.' Last year Northampton became the focus of a clown craze when budding filmmaker Alex Powell dressed as a clown and posted pictures of himself on Facebook. However, he said the pranks were intended to amuse people and did not terrorise children.","Creepy trend for dressing as  'evil clown' has swept from America to Europe .

"Fashion designer John Galliano has lost his £10 million case for unfair dismissal by Dior after he was sacked for making anti-Semitic slurs. The 54-year-old was suspended and later fired as creative director at the prestigious design house after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was Jewish that he 'loves Hitler' and that her parents should have been 'gassed'. He admitted two counts of making anti-Semitic insults in public at a court in the French capital in June 2011, following two separate incidents in the restaurant in the Marais, the historic Jewish district of Paris. Sacked: Fashion designer John Galliano, pictured arriving at a Paris court last year (left) and during his tenure at Dior (right), has lost his £10 million case for unfair dismissal by the fashion house after he was sacked for making anti-Semitic slurs . Video nasty: Filmed in December 2010 at restaurant La Perle, the video shows Galliano nursing a drink while sitting alone at a table, and then referring to the Nazi Holocaust . Filmed in December 2010 at restaurant La Perle and uploaded the next February, the video shows Galliano nursing a drink while sitting alone at a table, and then referring to the Nazi Holocaust. Galliano says to two unnamed Italian women : ‘People like you ought to be dead, your mothers, your forefathers would all be ****ing gassed. I love Hitler.’ When one of the women asks ‘Do you have a problem?’, Galliano replies: ‘With you, you’re ugly.’ The same woman says : ‘Where are you from?’, and Galliano replies: ‘Your ****hole’. Investigation: . Galliano is pictured in February 2011 arriving at a Paris police station after the tape emerged . Head down: John Galliano (front) arrives to deliver his statement at the 3rd Arrondissement police station . One of their male companions started videoing the incident because he was so shocked. At his one day trial in June, 2011, he admitted two instances of making anti-Semitic and racist comments and that September was given two suspended fines totalling 6,000 euros. The court was told he had abused museum curator Geraldine Bloch about being Jewish dduring a trip to the cafe in February 2011, as well another incident the previous October. Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud said the low damages and fine reflected his lack of previous convictions, and attempts he had made to overcome his drug and alcohol addiction. He told the court: 'They are not views that I hold or believe in. I apologise for the sadness this whole affair has caused.' Despite his 15 years at Dior, he lost his job after the video emerged, costing him up to £10million in lost earnings, according to his lawyers. Dior owners had LVMH cited a zero-tolerance policy on racism and anti-Semitism, while actress Natalie Portman, one of the faces of the brand, was among those outraged by his remarks. Actress: Natalie Portman, one of the faces of the brand, was among those outraged by his remarks . At the time the Oscar-winner said: 'In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr Galliano in any way. 'I hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful.' Following a drawn-out claim for unfair dismissal from the designer, a Paris employment court has now rejected it. In a judgement handed down late on Tuesday, judges ordered him to pay a symbolic one euro to both Dior and the John Galliano label,which is still owned and run by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group. Chantal Giraud-van Gaver, Galliano's lawyer, said her client was 'very disappointed' by the ruling, and might appeal. A graduate of London's prestigious Central Saint Martin's College, Galliano was famous for his theatrical, romantic shows at Dior as well as for his creative designs for his own-name brand. In 2001 he was made a Commander of the British Empire, and received his award from the Queen at Buckingham Palace that November. Since losing his job at Dior,  Galliano has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for New York fashion brand Oscar de la Renta in 2013. Last month he was hired as creative director of Belgian brand Maison Martin Margiel, which described him as one of the 'greatest undisputed talents of all time'. Galliano's latest collection for his new label is due on the Paris runway in January. John Galliano receives his Commander of the British Empire award from the Queen in November 2001 . John Galliano transcended his humble roots to become one of the most powerful men in fashion. The Gibraltar-born designer, pictured, who once defined style as wearing 'an evening dress to McDonalds', grew up in south London the son of a plumber who had come to England looking for work. He has often mentioned the influence of his Spanish mother who dressed him and his sisters in immaculately pressed and starched clothes whenever they left the family home. He worked as a dresser at the National Theatre and threw himself into the London club scene - experiences that left their mark on his sense of style. But it was as a student at the capital's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design that he was first noticed with a degree collection influenced by revolutionary France. He was a runaway success but became disillusioned with the British fashion scene after a financial backer withdrew support, and moved to Paris in 1990. Five years later he was appointed head of Dior - the first Englishman to head one of France's fashion flagships. The news sent shockwaves through the fashion world but did not seem to affect the supremely confident Galliano. His long-time creative collaborator Amanda Harlech once described disagreeing with him, saying: 'I did only once and I can only compare it to being hit by a massive surfing wave. His indifference was absolute.' His confidence brought him celebrity supporters with actresses including Charlize Theron and Marion Cotillard wearing his designs. He also designed Kate Moss's dress for her wedding to Jamie Hince in July 2011 after asking him while he was still at Dior.","54-year-old was fired from design house after abusive video surfaced .

"A multi-millionaire businessman was today ‘designated’ the father of the love child of France’s first ever female justice minister. A court in Versailles, west of Paris, handed down the ruling after considering evidence that Dominique Desseigne, 70, fathered a four-year-old child, with Rachida Dati, 48. The glamorous politician remains a Paris mayor and MEP after serving as justice minister for two years up until 2009. Dominique Desseigne, left, claims that he is not the father of Rachida Dati's four-year-old child . She was linked with up to eight boyfriends at around the time she was seeing Mr Desseigne – a revelation which emerged during their bitter paternity row. Mr Desseigne, head of casino group Groupe Lucien Barriere, refused to take a DNA test after being accused of being Zohra’s father. Mr Desseigne last year told M, Le Monde’s magazine, that he was one of many who had an 'adventure' with Ms Dati, and that he 'does not know' if he is Zohra's father. Moreover, his lawyers suggested in written evidence that she was involved in 'up to eight relationships' at the time. These included 'a TV host, a minister, a chief executive office, a Spanish prime minister, a brother of Nicolas Sarkozy, a Qatari Attorney General and the heir to a luxury goods empire,' said the M article, published in 2012. Mr Desseigne refused an application made by Ms Dati at a court in Versailles, near Paris, to submit to a DNA test. According to French law, anybody approached for a test can say no, although Ms Dati was said to have other proof, including sworn statements from her staff that Mr Desseigne constantly visited 'their' child soon after she was born. According to Le Parisien newspaper and Itele news channel, Mr Dessiegne has now been ‘designated’ the father. Rachida Dati will now receive more than £2,000 a month in child maintenance from Mr Desseigne . He is set to appeal the decision, the news outlets claims.It means he will have to pay up to £2,000 a month in child maintenance, although the figure is likely to end up being a let more, given his massive wealth. Those suspected of being the child's father in the past have included a range of public figures, ranging from former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Anzar to former French president Mr Sarkozy. Ms Dati, a notorious self-publicist, encouraged the speculation in a range of interviews in magazines like Paris Match, in which she also appeared in glamorous photo shoots.Ms Dati, who comes from a North African immigrant background and who has one failed marriage behind her, has been single since her early 20s. Mr Desseigne is believed to be worth more than £500 million due to his hotel and casino holdings . She became the star of President Nicolas Sarkozy's ethnically diverse 'rainbow cabinet' in 2007 in an attempt to get minorities into government, but was unceremoniously sacked in 2009 when it was claimed she was not up to the job. Mr Desseigne, who is worth more than £500 million, was a close business ally of the Mr Sarkozy. The former president famously celebrated his election win in Le Fouquet's, a chic restaurant on the Champs Elysee which Mr Desseigne owns. Mr Desseigne has two grown up children from his marriage to his late wife Diane Barriere-Desseigne, who died in 2001. Neither Ms Dati nor Mr Desseigne were immediately available for comment.","Rachida Dati took Dominique Desseigne to court over paternity of her child .

"Immigrants in Calais who are desperate to reach Britain have complained to charities that the free food being handed out to them is not spicy enough. Many were accused of being ‘pampered’ after they rejected the meals offered in northern France by the aid association Salam. The group’s spokesman, Jean-Claude Lenoir, said it was ‘very disappointing’ that some went without a meal because of the row. A migrant sits outside his makeshift shelter in Calais. French aid association Salam has said some migrants have turned their noses up at the food being offered, claiming it is not spicy enough . ‘The leaders staged a small protest and prevented the others from coming to eat,’ he said. ‘This was unacceptable.’ Mr Lenoir said the meal was ‘a lot less salty and not very spicy’ compared with what was usually served. He said spices are ‘very expensive’, and went on to criticise the refugees. ‘I find that they’re a bit too pampered by now,’ he said. ‘As soon as 15 or 20 refused the meal, I stepped in to tell them if they didn’t want the food we could put it away and that it was scandalous,’ he said. Around 2000 migrants sleep rough in Calais as they try to board ferries to the UK . Migrants wait on the roadside as they attempt to board ferries towards the UK. Some have bee described as 'too pampered' after rejecting the meals handed out to them . Referring to the tough economic circumstances in his home country, Mr Lenoir said: ‘Many in France don’t even have an evening meal.’ While aid workers were happy to help the migrants, ‘there are limits with regards to what we can propose’. There was no violence during the protest against the food being served, and some of the migrants apologised afterwards. A dozen illegal immigrants travelling in the back of a refrigerated lorry on the M6 were discovered yesterday after one dialled 999 because he was so cold. Police had to close the motorway during morning rush hour after the ‘distressed’ illegal immigrant asked for an ambulance, begging for ‘urgent assistance’ in broken English. He dialled 999 because it was said to be the only phone number he knew in the UK. The call was traced and police pulled the lorry on to the hard shoulder near Hilton Park Services near Cannock, Staffordshire. Officers were stunned to see a dozen poorly-dressed men emerge shivering from the back of the lorry. The M6 was shut for two hours as the men – believed to be from North Africa and the Middle East – were examined. The driver of the lorry was being questioned by police last night. There are currently 2,000 migrants sleeping rough in the Calais area as they try to get aboard ferries to Britain. There, many will claim asylum, so gaining access to free housing and social security benefits. Over the summer, Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry. Ms Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally. The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out near other Channel ports, including Dunkirk and Cherbourg. All play a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with the police as they attempt to break into lorries that are heading for the UK. The migrants are mainly from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, and have crossed to Italy before travelling through mainland Europe. Violent clashes between rival migrant groups and people smugglers have also broken out in Calais. According to the Calais Prefecture, 7,414 undocumented migrants were arrested in Calais in the first six months of this year, compared with 3,129 detained in the same period of 2013. Most of those detained are soon released.","Migrants in Calais rejected meals handed out to them by a French aid charity .

"Introduced to the world in 2009, Predator X was hailed as the most fearsome of all prehistoric creatures. An immense, big-headed marine reptile - said to have been 50ft long with a bite four times more powerful as Tyrannosaurus rex - spawned a host of excited commentary, documentaries and even a B-movie. Now, four years after the initial discovery of the beast's fossilised remains, Predator X has finally been given a technical description and a name - and it seems the hype overreached the facts. Fearsome: An artist's impression of Predator X, who has now been fully studied and named Pliosaurus funkei by the team who discovered its remains in the Arctic island of Svalbard . A team from the University of Oslo uncovered two big pliosaurs - short-necked, large jawed marine reptiles - between 2004 and and 2012 on the Arctic island of Svalbard. Previously the only pliosaur remains found on the island was a section of tail vertebra, so the find was hailed as a major discovery. The specimen dubbed Predator X got greater fame, while the other enjoyed five minutes in the spotlight as The Monster. Writing in the Norwegian Journal of Geology, palaeontologists Espen Knutsen, Patrick Druckenmiller, and Jørn Hurum have now named the creatures Pliosaurus funkei, and they admit the remains of both only offer partial views of what this marine apex predator was like alive. Svalbard's regular freeze-thaw cycles have severely fragmented the fossilised skeletons, the trio reports, and some parts further degraded as they dried them out in the lab. In the case of the specimen used as the basis of the new species, known as PMO 214.135, the surviving material consist of only a few fragments of jaw, some vertebrae from the neck and the back, and parts of the right front flipper. The second, larger specimen - PMO 214.136 - includes parts of the back of the skull, a few vertebrae and 'several fragmentary and unidentified bones'. Fossilised: This image shows a section of snout belonging to specimen PMO 214.135 from two angles. Yellow . shading indicates dentary teeth, red shading indicates premaxillary . teeth and numbers indicate tooth number . Fragment: This shows a part of the same specimen's lower jaw with the same key . Study: Cervical centrum from PMO 214.135 shown . in articular (A1) and lateral (A2) view, and a second cervical centrum . from the same specimen in lateral view (B) Flaky: Pectoral vertebrae from PMO 214.135. Svalbard's regular freeze-thaw cycles have severely fragmented the fossilised skeletons and some parts further degraded as researchers dried them out in the lab . Ancient: A piece of dorsal centrum from PMO 214.135 seen from two angles . Bone structure: Four dorsal vertebral centra and three associated neural arches (shaded yellow, orange, and red) from PMO 214.135 . Marine reptile: Right coracoid from the specimen in ventral . view. A fault (red dashed line) runs obliquely across the coracoid. Several dorsal ribs (shaded orange) lie dorsally to the coracoid. The . posterior part was reconstructed based on a preserved element, which was . displaced along a fault . The same fragment seen in dorsal view: Several gastralia (shaded yellow) lie on the dorsal side of the coracoid . Aquatic: The specimen's right front paddle, . showing Humerus and epipodials in dorsal view (A), and the humerus in . proximal view (B) Fingers: The phalanges of the right front paddle of PMO 214.135 shown in ventral view . Efforts to figure out the size of . Pliosaurus funkei were complicated by this incomplete nature of the . remains, with the palaeontologists only able to estimate the size of . their specimens based on measurements of other pliosaurs. Both . creatures had originally been estimated at a monstrous 50ft long - . making them the biggest pliosaurs ever found, according to Professor . Hurum when he announced the discovery. The new paper shrinks the beast . somewhat. Now the . palaeontologists estimate the complete skull of PMO 214.136 to have been . between about six and eight feet long - big, yes, but comparable to the . size of at least one other known pliosaur. The . skull of the other specimen was smaller at between five and . six-and-a-half feet long, which is still impressive but within the range . of what researchers have previously found. The beast: Partial basioccipital including the occipital . condyle of specimen PMO 214.136 - aka Predator X - shown in right . lateral (A), posterior (B) and dorsal (C) views . Massive: Left posterior jaw fragment of Predator X seen in in lateral (A) and oblique posterior (B) view . Conjecture: What researchers believe to be the left surangular of Predator X in what they think are the dorsal (A) and lateral (B) views . Inconclusive: Anterior cervical vertebral centrum of Predator X in what is thought to be anterior articular (A), left lateral (B) and ventral (C) views . Making good estimates of body length is more complicated still. Guessing the size of pliosaurs is notoriously difficult since many species are known only from fragmentary remains, with palaeontologists forced to estimate size based on bones thought to act as a proxy for overall length. On the basis of measurements of the creatures' vertebrae, the Norwegian team's educated guess is that Pliosaurus funkei was between about 33 to 42ft long, putting them squarely in the same size range as the largest specimens previously known to science. Back-pedalling from the hype surrounding to discovery of Predator X, they now describe their specimen as merely 'one of the largest pliosaurs described so far'. With so many gaps in the evidence, the view of Pliosaurus funkei remains incomplete. Nevertheless it seems Svalbard's pliosaur fossils are not nearly so big or spectacular as had been hoped. Indeed, the palaeontologists now 'urge caution in drawing far-reaching conclusions of pliosaur ecology and behaviour' based on their findings.","Prehistoric marine reptile first announced in 2009 when it was claimed to be biggest and most fearsome of all pliosaurs .

"The wife of a British tourist found dead in a hotel car park in France says she is living a 'nightmare' as police revealed her husband was drinking heavily before his death. John Napoletani, 50, was found dead at the weekend lying in a pool of blood with a large head wound. Investigators immediately launched a murder investigation but have not yet ruled out the death being caused by a tragic accident related to heavy drinking. Mr Napoletani was found near to a £25-a-night budget ‘Formule 1’ hotel in the Epenottes industrial estate in Dole, a town near Dijon, in the Jura department of the Franche-Comte region. John Napoletani and his wife were visiting Dole (pictured) on their way back from a holiday in Italy . John Napoletani, aged 50, was found lying in a pool of blood and had a large head wound (file picture) Scene: The man's wife called police on Sunday morning when she realised he was missing . They were driving back from a holiday in Italy when they stopped at the hotel for the night, his wife Evenlyn told the Daily Telegraph. She said: 'I am devastated. It's like a nightmare. I keep thinking I am going to wake up and it's all been a bad dream.' Detectives said he had been due to spend Saturday night at the hotel with his wife and a friend, but had gone out by himself without explanation. While prosecutors initially launched a murder investigation, police have not ruled out a tragic accident, with Mr Napoletani falling over and injuring himself. The Napoletanis, who had been married for 28 years, came from Colchester, Essex, and were on holiday with a male friend. They were all sharing a room at the hotel, and left their Renault Espace parked outside, with a ‘large quantity of wine from Italy’ inside. A local police spokesman said: ‘They had all been drinking heavily, with the third man in a state of intoxication when we spoke to him on Sunday. He was taken to hospital.’ Referring to Saturday night, the spokesman said: ‘Following the walk apparently to get some air, the victim did not return to his wife.’ The spokesman said that all three members of the party had been seen drinking on a table outside the hotel earlier on Saturday evening. The man’s wife called police on Sunday morning, which is when the body was found, between the hotel and a nearby discount warehouse. The police spokesman said: ‘The call to police was logged at around 9am. The victim’s wife was concerned about his whereabouts, as he had not been seen since Saturday night.’ Mr Napoletani was found dead in a hotel car park in eastern France and had been drinking heavily, police said . Some 25 people have so far been interviewed in connection with the suspected crime, including hotel staff. One of the reception workers at the hotel said: ‘They arrived at around 6pm and took a room for three. It’s such a terrible tragedy – nobody knows what happened.’ No weapons has been found, and police do not know how the head wound was caused. CCTV has also been examined, but it is not thought to contain any important clues. The couple were on their way back to the UK from Italy with the friend and had stopped off for the night in Dole, which is a short distance from the Swiss and Italian borders. It is used as a stopover for numerous drivers using the major motorways which link southern and northern France. The hotel was closed on Monday, along with the car park, as forensics experts searched for clues. An autopsy was meant to be held in the nearby town of Besancon yesterday, but it was postponed. The British Embassy in Paris has been informed about the incident, and is liaising with the dead man’s family. It is common practice for the French authorities to retain the names of accident or murder victims for operational reasons, but this practice has been criticised in the past by British police working on joint enquiries. There is often a fear that vital information can be lost in the early days of an investigation if people do not know the name of the deceased, or what he looked like.","Wife of Briton found dead in France says she is living a 'nightmare'

"Thousands of Britons were among those caught up in travel chaos on Monday as Air France cancelled half of its flights due to strike action. Pilots working for the troubled airline were taking action against its plan to pour more money into its low-cost subsidiary. The strike, which is expected to cost around £15m a day, saw huge queues building up at major airports as thousands were stranded. Passengers wait to check in at the Air France desk at Marseilles-Marignane airport in France on Monday . Strike: The industrial action is expected to cost the airline around £15m a day . Stranded passenger, businessman David Newman, from Birmingham, said: 'It's an absolutely chaotic situation - I'm desperate to get to Nice from Paris but nothing seems to be moving. 'Lots of services have been cancelled completely, but information is very hard to come by. It's a ridiculous situation. 'Air travel in France is always being hit by strikes - the country needs to sort this matter out.' Britons are the biggest visitor group in the world to Paris, while thousands of others use France as a hub to get to other parts of the world. Cancellations: Travellers look at departure boards at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on Monday . Delays: Passengers are urged to postpone or cancel their travel planes as Air France pilots strike . Air France sent 65,000 text messages to passengers warning them about cancellations and delays, but thousands just turned up anyway. A company spokesman urged those 'who have booked a flight between September 15 and 22 to delay their trip, change their ticket free of charge or claim a refund'. 'What are we meant to do, just sit at home when we're meant to be somewhere else?' said Jean-Philippe Beauchene, another stranded passenger. 'At least while you're at the airport you have a slim chance of travelling. Just giving up is not an option for most people.' Air France has been forced to cancel half its flights as pilots strike this week . 'Lack of information': Passengers wait near a flight information board at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris . SNPL, the main pilots' union at Air France, warned that up to 80 per cent of flights could be cancelled as the strike continues into this week. Air France employees fear that the development of their low-cost operator, Transavia, will lead to jobs being outsourced to other companies, and permanent jobs being reduced to part-time contracts. Jean-Louis Barber, the head of the SNPL union, told France's AFP news agency: 'This is about a point of principle. We're not even talking about a rise in wages. Mr Barber added: 'If the strike continues beyond September 15, the flight schedule will be modified as a result. The knock-on effects will be communicated to passengers the day before they are due to leave.' In response to the strike, British company easyJet on Saturday laid on 1,000 extra seats on flights from Paris to Toulouse and Nice.","Air France staff walk out over plans to prioritise its low-cost carrier .

"The teenage nephew of serial killer Ivan Milat was sentenced to at least 30 years jail today for a chilling axe murder in the same grim forest where his uncle slaughtered seven backpackers. Matthew Milat brought down a mediaeval-style double-edged axe onto the head of his childhood friend David Auchterlonie in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, where 20 years earlier Ivan Milat had murdered two British women and five other travellers. Matthew Milat's accomplice in the cold-blooded murder, Cohen Klein, was sentenced to at least 22 years behind bars. The pair, who were aged 17 and 18 at the time of the axe murder in November 2010, pleaded guilty to murder last year but despite letters of remorse by Milat, Acting Justice Jane Mathews said today that he remained a 'serious potential danger' to the community. Killer: Matthew Milat, a relative of notorious Australian serial killer Ivan Milat, was jailed for at least 30 years for axing a teenage friend to death . Referring to the teenage victim, Justice Mathews said it was impossible to describe the horror of the killing. 'It clearly falls in the worst category for the case of murder.' Milat, she said, 'took the life of an innocent young man who was unfortunate enough to be his friend in a completely brutal manner simply for his own enjoyment.' The NSW Supreme Court had heard that the before the killing, Milat had rubbed his hands together and said: 'We're going to Belanglo - someone's going to die.' Then, the day after the murder, Milat gloated about the killing and said 'You know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I'm doing what my family does.' Australia's notorious serial killer Ivan Milat is led from court during his trial in Sydney July 8, 1996. He killed seven backbackers . Victims: Ivan Milat murdered Deborah Everest, Anja Habschied, Simone Schmidl, (top/left to right), Joanne Walters, Gabor Neugebauer, Caroline Clarke and James Gibson (bottom/left to right) The location of the murder, the court was told, was 'significant' as it was where Ivan Milat had 'lured a number of people and murdered them.' Among Ivan Milat's victims in the late 1980s and early 1990s were English backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters who were given a lift by him - and driven into the forest where Miss Clarke was repeatedly stabbed and Miss Walters shot. A mobile phone that was running at the time of the murder of 17-year-old David Auchterlonie picked up Matthew Milat telling his intended victim: 'Tell people my f-----g business and you wind up hurt.' The audio also recorded the sound of the axe striking David Auchterlonie in the head. The judge said that to describe the recording as chilling was an understatement. 'It is extremely distressing material. 'You know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I'm doing what my family does.' Killer Matthew Milat . 'The sound of (David) crying out in agony is chilling in the extreme. '(David) was being entirely submissive during the whole of the episode and desperately tried to placate Milat.' The court heard details of a number of poems that Milat wrote during his time in custody including one that had the lines 'I am not fazed by blood or screams, nothing I do will haunt my . dreams.' Another 'very chilling' poem appeared to recount the murder, said the judge. 'It is quite the opposite (of remorse). He appears to be revelling in the memory of this terrible event.' She read one poem that Milat wrote more than nine months after the murder, entitled 'Your Last Day'. The first few lines ran: 'Click-clack Hear that, Stopping in the middle of the track, Are you getting Nervous in the back, Should be C---, your getting waked.' Psycho: Australian murderer Ivan Milat was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of seven backpackers in Sydney . The poem ended with the lines: 'Hear the crunch of leaves and feet, Feel your heart skip a beat Are ya gunna get away, No hope kid, this is your day, The day that you won't be found, Six feet under Neath the ground.' Milat was sentenced to 43 years in jail with a 30-year non-parole period, while his accomplice Klein was sentenced to 32 years imprisonment with a 22-year non-parole period. David Auchterlonie's mother, Donna Locke, wanted Milat to be sent away for life. 'He can still come out and live some of his life, which is something David can never do,' she said outside the court. 'He shouldn't have been allowed to leave until he was cold and grey in a body bag like my son when he left the forest.' Ivan Milat is serving seven life sentences for the Belanglo murders.","Matthew Milat, nephew of backpacker killer Ivan Milat, murdered childhood friend David Auchterlonie .

"Cruel: Craig Curtis, 27, has been jailed for 18 weeks after he battered his dog with a baseball bat because it urinated on the floor . A cruel dog owner hanged his six-month-old puppy by its collar and then beat it to death with a baseball bat because it had wet the carpet, a court heard. In what the RSPCA say is one of the most shocking cases they've seen, Craig Curtis, 27, strung Staffordshire bull terrier Bruno from his weightlifting bench after the pup urinated on the floor. Curtis has been jailed after he 'went ballistic' and battered the tiny dog, then put its lifeless body in his freezer before dumping him later in nearby woodland. Cambridge Magistrates’ Court heard Bruno’s body was found wrapped in blood-stained sheets by a dog walker who immediately called the RSPCA. Officers traced the tragic pet back to Curtis, who lives in Exning, Suffolk, who was then arrested and charged. He has pleaded guilty to cruelty charges under the Animal Welfare Act. Sentencing him to 18 weeks in jail, magistrate Phil King said: 'Mr Starr [prosecuting] has described this as one of the worst cases he has ever seen and the bench must agree with him having seen the photographs. 'This is absolutely appalling. You are shaking your head and I think you agree with me.' Curtis’ crime was uncovered when Bruno, a male brindle and white Staffordshire bull terrier was found in the woods on March 25 this year. The RSPCA initally believed Bruno had been poisoned due to the large amount of blood around his nose and mouth. But a post mortem revealed he had suffered fractures to his skull and died after being struck around the head with a blunt instrument. Attack: The young Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy (file pic) was killed just for wetting the floor . Shockingly tests also revealed that Bruno was alive for a long period while the attack on him took place, and also a child could have been in the house at the time. Robert Starr, prosecuting, said: 'This is easily the nastiest case I have come across, certainly the most violent and the most deliberate. 'This was a malicious, deliberate act. This man should not be left in charge of animals.' RSPCA inspector Richard Lithgoe, who investigated the case, said: 'This was easily the most shocking case of cruelty I have ever seen. 'This is a horrendously violent man - I was so shocked at how ferocious and brutal this attack was. 'This poor young dog was victim to a senseless brutality and would have been in an extreme amount of pain. Shame: Cambridge Magistrates Court heard the harrowing case that cost the life of an innocent puppy . The worst part is he was alive when this attack took place and so would have suffered a long, lingering, gruesome death.' Jacqui Baldwin, mitigating, said there was a child living in the home and the dog’s behaviour had worsened and there were concerns it might go further. 'As far as he was concerned, the dog was ordinarily a well-behaved dog but it started to turn,' she said. Ms Baldwin said Curtis had 'taken on board quite a bit of alcohol' since starting to suffer from depression and alcoholism, which had clouded his judgment on that occasion. She said he had since taken part in alcohol and drug awareness courses and 'shows a substantial amount of remorse.'","Craig Curtis battered his puppy Bruno because he urinated on the floor and then dumped him in some woodland .

"The Florida fertility doctor's son who caused his girlfriend to miscarry their baby by tricking her into taking a pill which is contraindicated for pregnant women was sentenced to over 13 years in prison on Monday. John Andrew Welden, 28 of Tampa was handed nearly the maximum sentence he could receive as part of a plea deal in which he admitted to signing his father's name to a prescription. Welden then swapped out the label for drug Cytotec with one for an everyday antibiotic and fooled his girlfriend Remee Jo Lee, 27, into taking the pill. Scroll down for video... Sentenced: John Welden, seen here just after he was sentenced for slipping his girlfriend a drug and causing her to miscarry their baby, will spend nearly 14 years in prison for his crime . Victim: Remee Jo Lee (center) is seen here as she arrived to the U.S. District Court House in Tampa for Welden's sentencing. She lost her nearly 7-week pregnancy after Welden tricked her into taking Cytotec . She was six or seven weeks pregnant when she miscarried. Welden pleaded guilty in September to tampering with a consumer product and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He had faced a possible life sentence if convicted of his original charge, killing an unborn child. Welden admitted in a plea agreement that he forged the signature of his father, who is esteemed Tampa-area fertility expert Dr. Stephen Weldon. Welden’s father had no role in the heinous crime, but was in the courtroom in the weeks preceding sentencing as prosecutors sought to prove that the single dose of Cytotec had caused Lee’s miscarriage. Prosecutors succeeded after expert witnesses for the state testified that any amount of the drug also known as misoprostol could cause miscarriage. Plea: Here, Welden is escorted from the federal courthouse in Tampa after being released on bail. The 29-year-old confessed as part of a plea deal that spared him murder charges to swapping a drug for a common antibiotic and tricking his pregnant girlfriend into taking it . 'The only thing I want now,' Lee (left) said in court of Welden (right), 'is for the court to show Andrew the same amount of mercy he showed me in my pregnancy' As part of Judge Richard Lazzara’s decision, he said Welden is ‘not evil, he committed an evil act,’ reports WTSP, on that deprived Lee of her pregnancy in ‘the most cowardly way.’ Lee took the stand during the trial and glared at Welden, calling him a ‘dunce.’ 'The only thing I want now,' she said, 'is for the court to show Andrew the same amount of mercy he showed me in my pregnancy,' He’ll begin serving his 13.8 month sentence on Wednesday. He apologized profusely during the hearing and as he left. Lee . has spoken out about her heartache over the termination saying: 'I . wanted this baby more than anything. Not because it was Andrew's, but it . was my baby as well.' He was originally charged with murder but under a plea deal the charges were reduced to tampering with a consumer product and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He is currently awaiting sentencing. Lee told 20/20 how the tragic . event took place seven months into her relationship with Welden, who . was in a five-year relationship with another woman at the time. Prominent family: Welden is the son of prominent Tampa fertility expert Dr. Stephen Welden (right), who was not connected to the crime but was in court to support his son during the trial . Lies: John Welden took Lee to his father's office for an exam after learning of her pregnancy and the next day as a way of tricking her to take the pill told her she had a mild infection and needed to take an antibiotic . Tragic: The fetus, pictured here in an ultrasound, was at over six weeks old when Lee miscarried. She had decided to name the baby Memphis . Other woman: He was reportedly worried his other girlfriend, Tara Fillinger, would learn of the pregnancy . The couple hit it off after meeting at the gentleman's club she worked in and soon started seeing each other. 'He went through a long-term relationship with a young woman named Tara. He said that that relationship had ended,' she recalled. 'He never even used condoms with me,' Lee said, adding that he would tell her he loved her. 'I was well aware . of what could happen.' Welden was a doctor's son working . toward a degree in biomedical sciences and religion. When she told him . she was pregnant, he did not take the news very well. 'Oh God, I want to die. Are you serious?' Is what Lee said Welden texted her . when she sent him a picture of the pregnancy test results. Remee, . please don't do this, I beg you. I am destroyed.' Welden took her to his father's . office soon after for a prenatal exam and the next day he called her to . tell her she had a mild infection and needed to take medication to clear it up. 'He worked for his father, at his . father's clinics. So it wouldn't be strange or uncustomary, you know, to . call me personally,' said Lee. 'He said I had a mild infection. I just . needed to clear it up, that it would not hurt the baby.' Welden then gave Lee what he told her were amoxicillin pills, as well as prenatal vitamins. After taking one of the pills on her . way to work, Lee told 20/20 she went from 'being pregnant and sick with morning sickness, to a horrible pain, like someone had shoved a . bayonet into my stomach.' Happier time: Andrew Welden, pictured with his ex-girlfriend Remee Lee, allegedly gave her pills and claimed they were antibiotics. But hours later, she was rushed to hospital and lost the baby . 'Weapon of choice': This is the bottle of  pills that Welden gave to Lee after changing the label . She was rushed to hospital where she was told  she lost the baby. It was there, that a doctor saw the . pills Lee took and told her they were meant for inducing pregnancy. Federal . prosecutors said Welden never wanted Lee to have his baby - even . though she was determined to keep the pregnancy and raise the child on her own. After she lost the fetus in the hospital, she went to police and . agreed to have her conversations with Welden recorded. 'I was hoping that this was some sort of horrible mistake,' Lee said. 'He told me what the medication was, and it was Cytotec.' Authorities released a transcript of a conversation Lee had with . Welden. Welden told Lee that Tara Fillinger, his other girlfriend, had found out about their relationship and was 'furious'. Lee says: 'If you wanted to go be with Tara, that's fine. Go be with Tara. 'I . woulda had my kid and I woulda been fine with that... woulda told my . parents it was someone else's. I wouldn't have bothered you for money. I . wouldn't have bothered you at all.' 'I didn't want to be that guy,' Welden replies. 'So you're going to be the guy that goes and just kills the baby without even letting me know?' Miss Lee says. 'To save your own precious hide? Right?' Welden responds: 'I guess. If I saved anything, I didn't really save anything.' Welden also takes time during his conversation with Miss Hill to pity himself. 'My life is over,' he whines. 'I just wanna kill myself.' After . he admits to giving Lee the drug he says: 'I'm just a . horrible person, Remee. I'm sorry I ruined everything.' His father Dr Stephen Welden has not been accused of wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime. He told 20/20: 'Throughout his life, he has been singularly the most kind, thoughtful, compassionate of all my children,' Welden was also recorded on jailhouse . phone calls threatening to smear Lee's reputation and told Miss . Fillinger that she didn't have to testify in the case, according to . court documents.","John Welden of Tampa, Florida gave his ex-girlfriend Remee Jo Lee pills and told her they were antibiotics - but they induced an abortion .

"The father accused of killing his six children in a house fire, ‘punched the air’ in anger when he was told his ex-mistress would not be arrested over an alleged threatening phone call, a court heard today. Michael Philpott, 56, said he would take matters into his own hands, according to a police officer who called to his house in Derby following the accusation against his former partner Lisa Willis. Mr Philpott is on trial alongside his wife Mairead, 31, accused of attempting to frame 28-year-old Miss Willis for the fire which killed six of his children. On trial: Michael Philpott (left), his wife Mairead (centre) and defendant Paul Mosley (right) have been accused of starting the fire which killed the children . Accused: Mairead Philpott and her husband Michael, pictured with the six children who died in the house fire, are both accused of manslaughter . It is alleged that the Philpotts, . along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, started the blaze in their . home in Allenton, Derby which killed their children: Jade, 10, John, . nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13. The petrol-fuelled blaze broke out in . the hallway of the home where Philpott lived with wife Mairead, 31, and . their own six children – all of whom perished as they slept. The court heard that until three . months before the blaze last May, ‘highly controlling’ Philpott shared . his cramped three-bedroom semi-detached home with his wife, mistress and . all 11 children he had with both women. Less than two weeks before the fatal . fire, Mr Philpott reported Miss Willis to the police, accusing her of . making a threatening phone call. PC Sharon Atwal told Nottingham Crown Court she was . one of the officers who went to see Mr Philpott in May after he alleged . his former mistress had threatened him over the phone. He told police Miss Willis had called him and said: ‘Leave me, my sister, and . my family alone or I’ll kill you,’ the court heard. ‘Mick told me that Lisa’s family had . never really liked him, they had never got on and they had never really . seen eye to eye,’ PC Atwal told the court. Prosecutor Richard Latham QC asked how . she thought he considered the alleged call, PC Atwal said: ‘Mick said . he did perceive it as serious and, in his words, he feared for his . safety and his children’s safety.' The children, five boys and a girl, aged between five and 13, died in the fire at their house in Derby, pictured. Flowers were left at the scene .

The family shared an unconventional lifestyle - Philpott (right), 56, his 31-year-old wife Mairead (left), and his mistress Lisa Willis, 28, all lived in the same house together . PC Atwal also said that it was clear that Philpott wanted Miss Willis taken into custody over the alleged threats. 'I took it that Mick had already made up in his mind the outcome he wanted.’ ‘And that outcome was?’ Mr Latham asked. ‘Lisa being arrested.’ Jurors heard police decided no action . would be taken against Miss Willis. When they returned to tell Philpott . this, he reacted angrily. ‘Mick became angry, started to punch out into thin air. Created a fist and punched out into thin air,’ the officer said. ‘He said he’d take matters into his own hands.’ PC Atwal said she explained Miss . Willis would be spoken to by officers just not under caution but . Philpott did not accept the decision. He left the room, after which thumping . was heard, which PC Atwal said she believed to be a wall or a door. Jurors were told Philpott brought some of his children into the room to talk to officers. ‘He lined them all up . military-fashion, he directed them to sit down, and they did, then Mick . directed them to tell the officers what they had heard,’ PC Atwal said. She went on: ‘One of the children spoke out. ‘One of the children said ‘They said they were going to kill Daddy’.’ PC Atwal said she was not comfortable . talking to the children because proper procedures had to be followed and . told Philpott that officers from the child protection unit had to deal . with them.

Shortly after, Philpott became unwell, . the officer said, and suffered an angina attack for which his wife had . to bring a medicated spray. Jurors also heard from Ian Cousins, husband of Lisa Willis’s sister Amanda, who was questioned about . his knowledge regarding the fire. It is alleged that Mick Philpott and . his wife Mairead, along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, started the . fatal blaze in order to frame Miss Willis as the culprit after she left . her relationship with Philpott. During Mr Cousins’ evidence to the . court, Anthony Orchard QC, defending Mick Philpott, asked him: ‘Are you . or were you connected to the setting of this fire?’ Mr Cousins answered: ‘Not at all.’ Mr Orchard asked: ‘Did you have any direct knowledge of who set the fire?’ ‘No,’ he replied. Arrival: A prison van believed to be containing the defendants arrives at Nottingham Crown Court today . The court heard Philpott (second from left) planned to frame his ex-girlfriend and eventually win his children back . Opening the case for the prosecution . last week Richard Latham QC told jurors the Philpotts lived an unusual . life at Victory Road. Miss Willis lived there with the . couple as Philpott’s mistress, along with her four children that were . fathered by him, and another child she had from a previous relationship. Another six youngsters, those who died in the fire, were the children of Mick and Mairead Philpott and also lived in the house. Jurors heard today from Mr Cousins . about events before the fire in February last year when Miss Willis went . to stay with him and his wife, from whom he is now separated, after she . had left Philpott. There was no love lost between Mr . Cousins and Philpott, he said, and both he and his wife were relieved . Miss Willis had finally decided to leave the relationship after 10 . years. ‘We knew that she had not been living in a very good situation and were just happy she had got out,’ Mr Cousins said. Fatal: Prosecutor Mr Latham told the jury the fire was started in the early hours of the morning on the day Miss Willis and Philpott were due in court to discuss the residency of the children . Floral tributes adorn the pavement outside the house following the fire . Mr Cousins, who was arrested by police . and questioned in relation to the fire before being released with no . further action, said Philpott had turned up at his home wanting to see . his children just weeks after Miss Willis had left. There was a tense confrontation, jurors heard, in which Mr Cousins and Philpott exchanged insults before police were called. The court also heard details of how . Philpott posted an entry on Facebook in which he accused Mr Cousins of . having an affair with Miss Willis and fathering the child she had when . she was 16. Mr Cousins said he and his wife both . knew the claims were not true, but conceded that the online post had . caused some upset between them. The court heard that on April 6, Philpott received a call from his wife while taking friends to a darts game in his minibus. Philpott . told his friends: 'Sorry guys, someone is threatening to torch the . house with the kids in it,' Mr Latham told the court.

"A besotted knifeman who plunged a blade into his ex-girlfriend’s chest while trying to 'get her attention' is back on the streets. David Martin, from . Sunderland, was originally accused of attempted murder after he thrust the weapon deep into the left side of Kate Taylor's chest after she told him he had to learn to live without her. Prosecutors at Newcastle Crown Court . today accepted the 31-year-old's plea of unlawful wounding, . which carries a maximum sentence of five years. He will be released from . custody due to the 17 months he has spent on remand since the attack, which . happened in his car. Attack: David Martin, who stabbed his girlfriend in the chest, is back on the streets after prosecutors accepted his plea of unlawful wounding . After two trials Martin was found not guilty of attempted murder but two juries . failed to agree whether he should be convicted of wounding with intent, . which carries a life sentence. Judge Paul Sloan QC sentenced Martin, who had also admitted having an offensive weapon, to 20 months behind bars. The attack took place in the car park at EDL at Doxford Park in Sunderland, where the former couple both worked, last May. The judge said: 'In a moment of desperation you took the knife out of your bag and held it against Miss Taylor’s chest, wanting to get her attention, wanting her to understand the state you were in. 'You clearly remained dependent upon her. There was a struggle and she tried to push the knife away. 'During the course of the struggle the knife, which was being held at an acute angle to her body, went into Miss Taylor’s chest.' Prosecutors at Newcastle Crown Court today accepted the 31-year-old's plea of unlawful wounding, which carries a maximum sentence of five years . The court heard the blade entered four inches into Miss Taylor’s chest and she told jurors she had feared she was going to die. Judge Sloan told Martin: 'You had not intended to stab her, let alone injure her, but you accept your actions were unlawful and reckless. 'Miss Taylor has been left permanently scarred to her chest. 'She has made a good physical recovery from the wound but the attack has had a marked psychological effect upon her.' Martin must abide by a restraining order which prevents him from contacting Miss Taylor in future . Martin must abide by a restraining order which prevents him from contacting Miss Taylor in future. The judge said: 'You introduced a large, potentially lethal knife into an argument and held it against Miss Taylor’s chest. 'There was a high risk of serious injury given the confined space you were in. It was a particularly dangerous act. 'This was an abuse of trust and power.' Martin’s criminal past was revealed in court yesterday for the first time. Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC said Martin first got in trouble with the police when he was just 13 and he was cautioned for using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour intending to stir up racial hatred. Martin was cautioned for burglary when he was aged 14 and convicted of assaulting a boy of the same age that same year. In February 2003 he was cautioned for affray which involved him fighting in the street. In 2008 he was cautioned for using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. In September 2009 he was cautioned for battery which involved him punching a 17-year-old male in the street. In April 2012, after his relationship with Miss Taylor ended, but before the attack on her, he was given a penalty notice for being drunk and disorderly. During the trials relating to the attack on her, Miss Taylor, who is in her 20s, told jurors she had not realised the knife was in her chest and initially thought her former lover had been trying to kiss her after she told him they were over. She said she only realised she had been stabbed when she saw the handle sticking out of her skin. Miss Taylor said: 'I thought he was trying to grab me or get hold of me and kiss me or trying to pull me into the car, then obviously I realised what was happening. 'There was just blood everywhere and obviously I saw the knife, or part of the knife, coming out of my chest and in his hand. 'I thought I was going to die because of where the wound was.' The court heard Miss Taylor had reluctantly agreed to meet up with Martin on her lunch break that day on May 11 last year after he had 'bombarded' her with messages and calls since their break up in November 2011. The court heard the couple had both been at work that morning and Martin had inundated her with messages while she repeatedly told him their relationship was over and they were now just friends. Martin told jurors at his last trial: 'I thought that the knife would get her attention.' He said he did not mean for the blade to penetrate her skin and had held the weapon against her while trying to 'pin her up' and make her listen to him. Martin told the court: 'I mean obviously I did stab her, I’m responsible for that. As soon as I realised the knife had went in and I saw the blood I took my hand off, I didn’t want the knife to go in, I only wanted to pin her up.' He told the court he and Miss Taylor had split six months before the stabbing but had stayed in touch while he was trying to 'wean away' from her. He said while explaining his thoughts to Miss Taylor he felt he was not getting her full attention. He said: 'She pulled the sun visor down and started topping herself up, she put eyeliner on and lipstick on. 'I just thought that she wasn’t listening, I thought, because I was in such a state, a desperate state, I didn’t feel like I had her attention. 'I saw the knife in the bag and decided to pull the knife out and try and pin her up to get her attention. 'I thought that the knife would get her attention.' Martin said Miss Taylor struggled when she saw the knife the blade went into her accidentally. Judge Sloan accepted Martin had been carrying the knife around in a rucksack while thinking about harming himself, not anybody else. Glen Gatland, defending, said Martin has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder and adjustment disorder. Mr Gatland said: 'What he was wanting was her attention. He told her she wasn’t listening to him. He said he needed help from her. 'He saw the knife in the bag, produced it and held it to her to get her attention.'","David Martin, 31, thrust knife into ex-girlfriend's chest during argument .

"A French mother who held her four-year-old son by the arms while he was raped by his stepfather in a prison visiting room has been sentenced to a maximum 20 years in jail. Sabrina Bonner, 25, blindfolded her child and made him kneel on a chair throughout the ordeal. Her partner, 31-year-old Lionel Barthelemy, who has been jailed since August 2009 for violence, also received the same sentence from the court in Strasbourg, eastern France. A French mother who held down her four-year-old son by the arms while he was raped by his stepfather in a prison visiting room has been sentenced to a maximum 20 years in jail (stock picture) Both Bonner and Barthelemy have admitted to multiple counts of rape and sexual assault of the boy, now eight. Some of the assaults, including the rape in the visiting room at the Toul detention centre in eastern France, had been filmed on a mobile phone. 'The behaviour of Sabrina B. is not even that of an animal towards its child,' said prosecutor Gilles Delorme, who also described Barthelemy as 'a sadist in the purest form'. At the detention centre, Bonner had blindfolded her son and made him kneel on a chair in front of Barthelemy, then held him by the arms as he was raped. The case had raised questions over why prison staff failed to stop, or even notice, an act of such brutality taking place during what was supposed to be a supervised visit to a prisoner serving a sentence for domestic violence, who had been diagnosed as having schizophrenic tendencies. Investigators had found that black bin bags were used to cover the glass window of the door of the visiting room. Yannick Pheulpin, the lawyer representing the victim, said he intended, at the end of the trial, to initiate legal proceedings aimed at holding the prison to account for the suffering of the child. Sabrina Bonner, 25, blindfolded her child and made him kneel on a chair throughout the ordeal. Her partner, 31-year-old Lionel Barthelemy, who has been jailed since August 2009 for violence, also received the same sentence . Psychiatrist Jean-Pierre May told the court that the couple had a 'sado-masochist relationship' in which each took turns to be 'master' and 'slave'. 'It is hard to determine who used the other more' during the savage acts carried out on the boy, said another expert, Jean-Georges Rohmer. Bonner has admitted carrying out multiple sexual assaults on her child during 2009 and 2010, filming them on her mobile phone and giving the phone’s memory card to her imprisoned partner. She gave herself up to police in May 2011, shortly before Barthelemy was due to be released from prison. Bonner has claimed that she carried out the assaults under the orders and threat of violence from Barthelemy.","Sabrina Bonner, 25, blindfolded child and made him kneel on chair .

"Sentenced: Craig Thomas, 33, has been jailed for 10 years after he repeatedly hit his pregnant girlfriend on the stomach saying he would 'beat the baby out of her' A man who repeatedly hit his pregnant girlfriend on the stomach saying he would 'beat the baby out of her' has been jailed for 10 years. Craig Thomas beat his partner, who was 11 weeks pregnant, with the pipe from a vacuum cleaner three times in what a judge said was one of the worst cases of domestic violence he had ever seen. Cardiff Crown Court heard how 33-year-old Thomas also threatened to pull the terrified woman's teeth out, hit her with a hammer before ordering her to make him a cup of tea, and frightened her so much that she wet herself. The court was told that Thomas had met the victim several years ago when she was working as a nightclub dancer in Cardiff. They became friendly and Thomas had comforted her when she told him about a former partner who had been violent towards her. The pair started a relationship earlier this year and the defendant moved into her home in Llanishen. However, just a week and a half after she moved in Thomas began acting violently towards the woman - initially on a weekly basis before it soon became a daily occurrence. The relationship lasted a couple of months until Thomas was arrested. The court heard how, on one occasion, he . hit his victim round the head with a hammer it before taking her to the . kitchen to clean the blood up and telling her to make him a cup of tea. 'I was expecting to die in this relationship and I thought this might be the time,' she said in a statement read out in court. On June 6 this year, she told Thomas she was 11 weeks pregnant - only for his reign of terror to heighten. On three occasions he took a pipe off a vacuum cleaner and hit her repeatedly on the stomach, saying he would 'beat the baby out of her'. Her statement continued: 'I was scared that you would kill me and the baby.' As well as threatening to pull her teeth out with pliers, the court heard how he had threatened to cut her son’s face if she didn’t do what he wanted. In another incident he assaulted her because she didn’t have any sugar for his cereal. Over the course of the relationship, the court heard how he had also burnt the victim with cigarettes, head-butted, kicked and punched her. Violence: Judge Neil Bidder, sitting at Cardiff Crown Court, described Thomas¿ crimes as 'an appalling catalogue of very serious violence', and said it was one of the worst cases of domestic violence he had ever encountered . One on occasion, she was so terrified of Thomas that she wet herself. At . one point, a friend took the victim to a local A&E department with . her injuries where she told staff that her partner had beaten her. However, she did not report it to the police at that time, claiming she was scared of what he might do. The . violence finally came to police attention after she ran out of the . house in her pyjamas one night to a nearby garage, the court heard, . where one of the garage workers had described her as looking 'very . battered'. 'This is one of the worst cases of domestic abuse I have encountered.' Judge Neil Bidder . She was taken to hospital and Thomas was arrested. When he was first interviewed by police Thomas denied ever assaulting his victim. He had also lied to officers, saying her injuries were the result of self-harm. However, he later pleaded admitted his crimes in court. The victim said that as a result of the attacks she has permanent cosmetic damage to her ear, multiple scars and suffers facial spasms. She is also worried she will not be able to carry on her dancing career due to the cosmetic damage. The court heard how Thomas, who also has a previous conviction for assaulting a former partner, had partly blamed his violent behaviour on his cocaine use. Judge Neil Bidder described Thomas’ crimes as 'an appalling catalogue of very serious violence', and added: 'This is one of the worst cases of domestic abuse I have encountered.' Thomas had pleaded guilty to three charges of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm, one of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and one of wounding inflicting grievous bodily harm. The judge gave Thomas a concurrent prison sentence of 10 years in total for his five charges, as well as ordering him to pay £120 in costs. A restraining order has also been placed on the defendant, forbidding him from contacting the victim or her son. The judge said that fortunately there were 'no injuries caused immediately' to the victim’s baby.","Craig Thomas beat his partner three times with a vacuum cleaner pipe .

"When Colorado teacher Jen Sculley heard one of her students desperately needed a kidney transplant she didn't think twice about offering to help. The physical education teacher at Denver's East High School and her student, who has not been named, are both making good progress after their operations on Friday. Miss Sculley offered to help the girl as a way to honor an aunt who died recently from cancer and who shared the same name as the student. Generous: Jen Sculley recovers in hospital after donating a kidney to one of her students . She first learned of her student's health problems when the girl, who was having dialysis every day, told her she wouldn't be able to join in all the activities in the sports class. The student has FSGS, a rare disease that attacks the kidney's filtering process. As she explained her problems, Miss Sculley said she heard a clear voice saying: 'You are going to give her a kidney.' The girl's family and friends had already put themselves forward as possible donors but no match had been found - until Miss Sculley was tested. The teacher said she was moved to help as a way to honor her aunt who had died from lung cancer over the summer.

"'A significant risk to the public': Andrew Cumming, 30, from Hull, has been jailed for 13 years after attacking pensioners . A man who launched violent and unprovoked attacks on defenceless pensioners has been imprisoned for 13 years. Andrew Cumming, 30, from Hull, beat one woman in her 80s unconscious and broke another elderly man's jaw, cheekbone and eye socket, Hull Crown Court heard. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told Cumming he posed a 'significant and enduring risk to the public' and said he had considered jailing him for life, but was not allowed to by current law. He said: 'Your conduct almost defies belief. You deserve severe punishment and that is what you will get. 'You told a man you wanted to rip off ""coffin-dodgers"". That vile remark reveals your cruel, callous and predatory character. 'You have preyed upon the elderly and vulnerable with a vicious determination.' The court heard that Cumming, who has 78 previous convictions, many of them against the elderly, robbed an 82-year-old woman in her home in Nidderdale, east Hull, after knocking on her door complaining he had glass in his eye one day last September. When she opened her door to help him, he burst in and grabbed her, dragging her from room to room and destroying her treasured photographs. He left her unconscious on her bedroom floor before stealing £853 and her handbag. She told police how she tried to fight him off but he was too strong. Judge Richardson said: 'Out of compassion, she opened the door. You then saw your chance and seized it. 'You . left her injured and terrified. Having regard to your appalling history . of targeting the elderly, this is a particularly serious crime and you . deserve a long jail sentence.' Sentencing Cumming at Hull Crown Court, the judge said he had 'an appalling history of targeting the elderly' Cumming also set upon a couple and their friend out walking their dogs in the Yorkshire countryside. He punched a 74-year-old man four times in the face as he lay on the ground, leaving his cheekbone, jaw and eye socket broken. The man needed surgery to insert metal plates into his face following the assault in August last year. Police described the attack on the man as 'vicious and sustained', lasting up to quarter of an hour. Cumming also punched the man's wife in the face when she tried to help her husband, and snatched a mobile telephone from her friend’s hand when she tried to call police. Judge Richardson said: 'This was serious violent conduct towards senior citizens.' Cumming attacked them after accusing the woman of failing to clear up after her dog. He was also sentenced for trying to defraud two elderly sisters in the Yorkshire village of Cottingham out of more than £3,000 for garden work he had not carried out. Cumming admitted robbery, wounding and two charges of fraud. Jailing him for 13 years, Judge Richardson said: 'You are an habitual criminal of a predatory kind. 'You target elderly victims who are particularly vulnerable, which is part of your malevolent character. 'I have seriously considered imposing a life sentence, but I would not be justified in so doing under the current law. However, you will be severely punished. 'You pose a significant and enduring risk to the public, particularly elderly citizens.' Cumming was also given an extended licence period of a further five years.","Andrew Cumming, 30, from Hull, beat one 82-year-old woman unconscious .

"An Idaho woman has pleaded guilty to allegations that she had two of her children help her burn her 2-year-old daughter's body in a barrel after the toddler died of a head injury. Court records say Veronica Herrera of Homedale told investigators she 'freaked out' after her daughter Nakita jumped off a potty chair, hit her head on a heater and died hours later last August. The 29-year-old told police she put the toddler in a playpen after her injury and asked her 9-year-old son to watch her while she took some of her other children to her sister's home in Caldwell, according to documents. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mother: Veronica Herrera of Homedale, Idaho told police she was helped by two of her children in burning her 2-year-old daughter's body after she hit her head on a heater and died . Fatal accident: Herrera said that Nakita, pictured,  jumped off a potty chair and hit her head before putting her down to rest and finding her unresponsive several hours later . Burned: Herrera told police she was worried she'd lose custody of her other children so put the toddler's body in a barrel and lit it on fire with the help of two of her other children . Herrera told police she later called her son and asked how Nakita was doing and he said she was sleeping. When she came home later that night, she told investigators she noticed a large bump on Nakita's head and realized the child wasn't breathing. Herrera says she burned the body out of fear of losing custody of her children. Prosecutors said Herrera told police that she put the toddler's body in the back of her van that night, and that the next morning she walked to the store to buy lighter fluid, put the body in the barrel and set it on fire. She told police that she had her other . children put garbage in the barrel to keep the fire burning, but the . remains were still recognizable by the next morning so she bought more . lighter fluid, according to the court records. She told police she didn't think any of . her children realized their sister was in the barrel but added that her . 9-year-old 'is a smart kid and might have known,' according to the Idaho Statesman reports. Hysterical: Officers say Herrera, seen earlier in court, was hysterical as she admitted to her crime to police after confessing to her parents who urged her to report what she had done . Herrera made the statements to police after she told her parents about the death and they drove her to the police station. The officer who met her described her as hysterical and crying that 'God will never forgive her.' She admitted something bad had happened to her daughter and that she had made it worse. Herrera initially was charged with first-degree murder, but pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter on April 11. She pleaded guilty to failure to report a death, destroying evidence and three counts of injury to a child. Owyhee County Prosecutor Doug Emery says two injury charges relate to Herrera having two of her children help burn the body. Herrera is scheduled to be sentenced on July 25. Emery is seeking 15 to 40 years in prison for her.

"Fears: Head of MI5 Jonathan Evans admitted one British company lost £800 million because of hackers and Britain faces a huge threat from them . Criminals and rival states are using cyber terrorism on an 'industrial scale' to attack Britain's Government and its biggest businesses, the head of MI5 has said. State-sponsored espionage has already cost one UK listed company a fortune after hackers stole details of a contract and scuppered a £800 million deal. MI5 Director General Jonathan Evans said 'they will not be the only victims' as weaknesses in both state and commercial networks are being 'exploited aggressively' by cyber-criminals hell-bent on stealing secrets. He added that Britain had also faced a 'credible terrorist attack plot about once a year since 9/11' and will see more of the same as a result of the Arab Spring. And that cyber crime will become an increasing threat exploited by terrorists, . warning of global cyber warfare between countries and terror cells, as . well as between rival nations. Russia and China are believed to be the nations carrying out the majority of attacks on Britain's businesses, focusing particularly on those in the oil and weapons industries. 'The extent of what is going on is astonishing. There are industrial-scale processes involving many thousands of people . lying behind both state-sponsored cyber espionage and organised cyber . crime,' he said in his first public speech for two years. 'Vulnerabilities in the internet are being exploited aggressively not just by criminals but also by states. 'So far, established terrorist groups have not posed a significant . threat in this medium, but they are aware of the potential to use cyber . vulnerabilities to attack critical infrastructure and I would expect . them to gain more capability to do so in future. 'This is a threat to the integrity, confidentiality and availability of government information but also to business and to academic institutions. 'What is at stake is not just our Government secrets but also the safety and security of our infrastructure, the intellectual property that underpins our future prosperity and the commercially sensitive information that is the lifeblood of our companies and corporations.' Warning: Thousands of hackers are threatening state and commercial systems at all times . Mr Evans also warned that parts of the Arab world were becoming a more permissive environment for al Qaida and Britons were travelling there to 'seek training and opportunities for militant activity'. Some will return to the UK and pose a threat and the situation 'could get worse as events unfold,' he said. It is believed that up to 200 British residents and nationals are currently in the Arab world and either involved in training camps, being radicalised or operationally active with terror groups. In a rare public speech just a month before the Olympic Games begin in London, Mr Evans said the Arab world was in 'radical transition'. 'Today parts of the Arab world have once more become a permissive environment for al Qaida,' he said. 'A small number of British would be jihadis are also making their way to Arab countries to seek training and opportunities for militant activity, as they do in Somalia and Yemen. 'Some will return to the UK and pose a threat here. 'This is a new and worrying development and could get worse as events unfold. 'So we will have to manage the short-term risks if there is to be a longer-term reward from the Arab Spring.' Yemen, Libya, Nigeria and Egypt are all understood to pose a risk.","MI5 boss Jonathan Evans says that terrorists and rival countries are attacking UK computer systems all the time .

"A paedophile whose partner smothered their two children to death in a Spanish hotel has been found hanged in his jail cell. Martin Smith, 46, was discovered by prison officers shortly after eating his evening meal. They battled to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead half an hour later. His partner Lianne Smith, 44 - the mother of his sex abuse victim - has been placed on suicide watch in a Spanish prison where she is being held. Smith, who claimed to be a psychic and hypnotist, was jailed for 16 years last March. Horror: Smith, with son Daniel, was placed on suicide watch after learning of her partner's hanging in prison . He had initially been arrested in 2007 and questioned by police over allegations he had sexually abused his step-daughter. But Smith and his partner, former children's services manager Lianne Smith, fled to Spain with their daughter, Rebecca, three, and began building a new life. A son, Daniel, was born in Barcelona and they set up a business among the thriving expat community. Meanwhile police had launched an international manhunt for Smith and he was eventually tracked down and arrested. Martin Smith, 46, (left) was discovered in his cell by wardens at Strangeways prison. His step-daughter, now Sarah Richardson (right) suffered a decade of abuse at his hands . He was held in a Spanish prison in March 2010 before being extradited back to the UK to face child sex abuse charges. Fearing their children, Rebecca, then five, and son, Daniel, 11 months, would be seized by social services Lianne Smith fled. She checked into a hotel in the seaside resort of Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava in May and just days later killed their two children. Spanish police say the youngsters were suffocated in Room 101 of the Hotel Miramar. A source at the prison where Miss Smith is being held said the couple wrote to each other every day from their prison cells. He said: ‘Lianne was absolutely devoted to Martin and had always wrongly believed he was innocent. 'The letters were a big part of her day, both writing and receiving them. ‘The highlight of her jail life would be when Martin telephoned her each month. She told friends that she lived for those eight minute phone calls.’ Miss Smith had previously told friends that if her partner was not alive she would kill herself to ‘be with her children’. Beccy and Daniel Smith play on a Spanish beach, days before they were suffocated in a hotel room . Shortly before the youngsters’ deaths she had compiled an album of their last ‘wonderful holiday’ together on the Costa Brava, then sent it off with a chilling farewell letter to a publicist in the UK. Smith has been found hanged in his cell at Strangeways prison in Manchester . In it she said: ‘Please find enclosed a batch of pictures that I took this weekend of my children. Since last speaking with you an attempt was made to take my children. ‘Fortunately I got out of the city with them and gave them a short and wonderful holiday before events you will start to hear about in the Press.’ She has admitted smothering them but denies murder, claiming she was not criminally responsible for the youngsters’ deaths, due to mental illness. At his trial Martin Smith, originally from North Shields, denied 11 counts of rape, attempted rape and indecent assault. The court heard he had abused his step-daughter, Sarah – Miss Smith’s daughter from a previous marriage – for more than a decade, starting when she was just seven. The jury heard that while her mother was out Smith would attempt to hypnotise her and put her in a trance before carrying out his sex attacks. Yesterday his victim, now Sarah Richardson, 23, declined to comment over his death in prison. After the case last year she waived her anonymity and spoke to the Daily Mail saying: ‘He abused me for more than a decade. Even after his arrest he prolonged my agony by fleeing abroad.’ She said by the time she was ten, Smith – who appeared on Living TV’s ‘Most Haunted’ – had started to use hypnotism to try to put her in a trance before raping her. The nurse, who is now married to electrician Mark Richardson, said her mother was ‘cold’ towards her children and ‘deeply flawed and deluded’. She said when she tried to tell her about the abuse her mother said: ‘If you are going to spread lies, you are no daughter of mine. I’m not going to listen to poison like that.’ Lianne Smith, 44, suffocated their children . Daniel, 11 months, and Rebecca, five, with a plastic bag at the resort . of Lloret de Mar . Beccy Smith enjoying an ice cream in Lloret Del Mar. Her mother has admitted killing Beccy and her brother, but claims diminished responsibility . Smith was discovered hanged on Monday when the cells were opened for prisoners to take part in their period of ‘evening association’. He had earlier taken his dinner on a tray to his cell at HMP Manchester where he was locked in while staff had their own meals. Deemed a ‘vulnerable’ prisoner, he was regularly risk assessed and was accommodated in a cell on his own. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Prisoner Martin Smith, 46, was found hanging by staff at HMP Manchester. Staff intervened but he was pronounced dead at the prison at approximately 7pm.’ British Embassy staff are believed to have broken the news to Lianne Smith along with a prison psychiatrist and social worker. She was immediately moved from a hospital ward at the prison where she was under ‘low level observation’ to a secure psychiatric hospital on the jail complex where she was placed on a 24 hour watch by a specialist team.

"She was brought into hospital after attempting to commit suicide with rat poison. But when nurses examined Sitabai Chouhan, they make a horrific discovery that was medieval in its barbarity. Four years ago, the housewife had been drugged by her husband Chouhan who then punctured holes with a needle on either side of her genitals. He had carried out the agonising assault so he could seal her private parts with a padlock when he went to work to stop her having sex with anyone else. Assault: Sitabai Chouhan lies on a makeshift bed in hospital where nurses discovered the makeshift chastity belt . When she was admitted to the Maharaja Yashwant Raoin Hospital in Indore, India, the crudely-fashioned chastity belt was still in place. It was only removed when police tracked down her husband and retrieved the key. He had kept the keys in his socks. Head constable Chhaganlal said: ‘The nurses confirmed the existence of a small lock. It was only after the husband’s arrest that the lock could be opened.’ Chouhan said he had done this because several women in his family had 'strayed' in the past. Barbaric: Chouhan said he had assaulted his wife because women in his family had strayed in the past . Mrs Chouhan is being treated in hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. Her husband, meanwhile, has been charged with cruelty and voluntarily causing grievous hurt. Police described him as an alcoholic who was mentally disturbed. Mrs Chouhan married her husband when she was 16. They have had five . She is said to have attempted suicide after her husband allegedly tried to rape their eldest daughter. A chastity belt is usually a piece of clothing that can be locked to stop the wearer having sex. The first recorded examples of their use is in the 15th century. But it is not a item completely alien to modern India. Human rights groups have reported their use in the conservative state of Rajasthan as recently as 2007. Gender rights activists say Indian women face a barrage of threats in India. Many of the crimes against women are a . result of a deep-rooted mindset that women are inferior and must be . restricted to being homemakers and childbearers. In addition, age-old customs such as . payment of hefty dowries at the time of marriage and widely held beliefs . linking a female's sexual behaviour to family honour have allowed . gender crimes to persist.

"Guilty: Andrew Summerfield (pictured at an earlier hearing) mutilated his own dog with a meat cleaver and repeatedly shot it with an air rifle . This is the thug who shot his own dog 10 times, stabbed it eight times with a meat cleaver, then left it for dead with a noose around his neck. Vets had to put the bull terrier down, but traced owner Andrew Summerfield, 43, from its microchip. He faces a possible jail term after he was convicted in his absence at Colchester Magistrates Court, Essex, of two offences of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. The court heard Summerfield shot the dog, called Barney, 10 times with an air rifle and stabbed it eight times with a meat cleaver before attaching a noose and leaving it for dead along the A12. Summerfield, of Colchester, did not attend court but the trial at Colchester Magistrates Court went ahead yesterday in his absence. Brenda Pearce, chairman of the bench, said she was satisfied Summerfield was guilty of two offences of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. She agreed Summerfield’s actions were so serious he is likely to go to prison. A warrant was yesterday issued for his arrest. She said: 'We are satisfied that Mr Summerfield was in possession of the dog at the time the injuries were caused. 'More importantly, the micro-chip links the dog to him, which is damning.' On July 10 last year police were called to reports of a stray dog walking along the southbound A12 at junction 28. Sgt Arin Andrews, of the Stanway Policing unit, was the first on the scene. He described how he found Barney with massive head wounds, with a blanket of blue bottle flies around it and maggots eating its flesh. He said: 'The dog had a cord around its neck and massive head injuries. Weapon: Police found this air rifle, used to shoot the dog 10 times, and a meat cleaver at Summerfield's house . 'It was actually cutting into its neck, causing it to be distressed and we were certainly concerned about the animal’s suffering' Police traced the dog to Summerfield’s address using a microchip found by the vet after he put Barney to sleep. Officers arrived at the home of the father-of-two, alongside RSPCA inspector Steven Craddock. Mr Craddock said when they arrived they found an air rifle, which was confiscated. But when they took the rifle out, they also found a meat cleaver. Cruel: Summerfield stabbed the dog eight times with this meat cleaver and then left him for dead along a road . Summerfield then told officers he had sold the dog the day before for £10, because it had bitten his finger and killed a duck. He did not attend the trial but had denied the charges, saying he acted in self-defence when the dog became very aggressive and started foaming at the mouth. But Lynne Shirley, acting for the RSPCA, said weapons experts’ tests showed it would take 150 seconds for a shooter to fire ten reloaded rounds at a sitting target. She added: 'If it was an act of self-defence, his actions were certainly disproportionate.'","Police found the dog with massive head wounds, flies around it and maggots eating its flesh .

"A Washington man who pleaded guilty last year . to butchering his three-year-old son to death because his wife was threatening to leave him will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, was sentenced Friday in district court in Dillon, Montana, to life for the grisly killing and dismembering of his young son Broderick Cramer last summer only two days before the boy's fourth birthday. On July 8, Cramer took Broderick to a remote field outside Anconda, Montana, and killed him following an argument with his wife, Nataliya. On Friday, District Judge Loren Tucker removed any option of parole, saying the brutality of the crime deserved the harshest punishment possible. 'He is an animal': Devastated Nataliya Cramer, pictured here with her ex-husband and their son he killed, was too upset to be in court for her ex-husband's sentencing . Jeremy Cramer, 38, sat slumped in a Montana courtroom on Friday after a judge sentenced him to life in prison without parole for the heinous murder of his three-year-old son . 'We're dealing with ... the gruesome, horrible, dismembered butchery of a child. Your child. It's almost impossible to fathom the gravity of that crime,' said the judge. Officials said Cramer's son died after being struck in the head with a rock, but that was only the beginning of the man's rampage. He then took a large knife and cut the boy's throat so badly he nearly severed his head clean off his shoulders, a parole officer described to the horrified court room. Investigators found the boy's heart nearby, his organs had been removed, lead investigator John Sullivan told jurors. The child's body was cut in two, with both halves found near to each other, he added. Cramer then made is way to a gas station to wash his own son's blood off his clothes, witnesses told police. The boy's remains were found the next day. He was also found with an empty bottle of Adderall, police said, likely a result of his on/off struggles with stimulants since he was a teenager. Butchered: Broderick Cramer was gutted and cut in half by his own father . Cramer had argued with his wife that morning, and she had told him that he would lose his family if he didn’t get his act together, Assistant Attorney General Brant Light said. 'I love my son and my wife with all my heart, and this is something I have to live with,' Cramer told the court said. Cramer was $30,000 in debt, couldn’t hold steady work and was using — and likely abusing — prescription drugs, Light said. He and his his wife had a similar argument a week prior, and Cramer told her then that she may leave, but she wouldn’t take their son, Light said. That morning, after the confrontation, Cramer snatched the boy, took his wife’s cellphone and drove away from their Lacey home. Nataliya Cramer dug up an old cellphone and called police that afternoon after her husband would not respond to calls or text messages. His former wife was not present in court, but a statement from her read aloud called him an 'animal' and questioned how she lived with him for five years. 'Why did he do this? Why did he hurt a boy who loved him with all his heart? her statement asked. 'I know for sure this was planned ahead of time,' she wrote, adding that he had threatened to take the boy when they divorced. Addict: Cramer, pictured in court last year, was deeply in debt, a former meth addict and had threatened his wife that he would take away her son in a divorce . He admitted killing his son late last year. Cramer . told Judge Loren Tucker back in December that he decided to change his plea from not guilty . because a prison sentence doesn't much matter with his son dead. 'I purposely killed my son,' he told the court. 'After a few months of thinking about it, I'm taking accountability for it,' Cramer told District Judge Loren Tucker of Dillon. 'Whether it's eight years or 80 years, my son's not here. I just want to get this over.' Cramer . was arrested July 8 after an Anaconda convenience store employee found . him washing blood from his clothes in the business's restroom. Cramer's . wife, Nataliya, told Lacey police then that her husband had taken their son . and had not answered phone calls or text messages. He was arrested when he refused to put his clothes back on. Police found bloody keys and a knife on Cramer when he was arrested. Cramer's wife confirmed her husband's identity and asked police to 'find my son.' Cramer refused to provide information . about his son or the location of his truck. Cramer, a Mormon, asked to . speak to somebody high in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day . Saints, saying 'the adversary,' or devil, 'is out.' The church president for southwestern Montana spoke with Cramer for an hour, but Cramer did not reveal the boy's location. At 5:27 a.m. the morning after the . arrest, Cramer called his father from the jailhouse near a sign that . says all calls are recorded. He also asked an officer whether phone . calls are recorded, the documents said. Cramer told his father that he started walking down the road, with Brody on his shoulders, after running out of gas. Where it happened: Police found the boy's butchered body in this field . The . boy became 'like some other kid when he was on my neck,' then he . remembered looking at his son's face and 'I just died right there,' Cramer said, according to the transcript. 'The . thing was, it wasn't like I had a few beers or it was like something . was up inside. Why did I take all my pills? Did I take all my pills?' His father suggested over and over that Brody may still be alive. 'Dad, Brody's dead,' Cramer said.'Are you sure?' his father responded. 'My son is dead, 100 percent, my son is dead, yes I did it, something did it of me but I didn't do it,' Cramer answered. 'He could be laying in a field still alive,' his father said a moment later. 'Dad, . he's dead, dead, dead, dead because I know he is. I just know it. I see . a vivid picture of him looking at him before ahhh. He's dead, OK,' Cramer said. Cramer told . investigators that morning as they were trying to read him his rights, . 'You gotta understand something. I killed my best friend.' The killer's brother, . Jon Cramer, told police his brother was a former methamphetamine addict . who had been 'doctor shopping' for a physician who would provide him . with Adderall.","Jeremy Brent Cramer will spend life in prison after admitting to killing his son Broderick on July 8 in a field in Montana .

"Sadistic: Nicola Tedder has been jailed for seven years for inflicting hideous injuries on the child . A sadistic woman who jumped on a little boy's stomach after losing her patience with him has been jailed for seven years. The savage assault led to the child being rushed to hospital with a perforated bowel, Guildford Crown Court heard. Nicola Tedder, 32, inflicted a catalogue of cruelties on the child, including plunging her fingers into his eyes, holding his feet against a piping hot radiator until they burnt and clasping her hands around his throat and pushing him under water. She hit him on the head with kitchen utensils and even rubbed his face in his own excrement if he soiled himself. Tedder, from Haslemere, Surrey, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. She was also convicted of four offences of assault causing actual bodily harm and one of child cruelty after a five-week trial at Guildford Crown Court. Alexia Durran, prosecuting, said: 'On one occasion she held his feet against a radiator which was hot enough to cause burning to his feet. 'On another occasion, she poked her fingers into his eyes, causing him ulcers and abrasions to his eyes. It looked like something out of a horror film.' The court was told that the defendant would put her hands around the boy’s throat and shove his head under bath water as well as hitting him over the head with kitchen utensils and rubbing his nose in his own excrement if he soiled himself. But the most serious assault was when Tedder jumped up and down on the youngster last year. Ms Durran said the injured boy was rushed to the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, suffering from excruciating abdominal pain. 'It was as a result of his stomach . being stamped upon. A doctor said he had only seen an injury like this . from a karate kick - which will give some idea of the force used,' she . said. Ms Durran said: 'The . victim said that the defendant had jumped on his stomach with both feet. She was wearing flip-flops at the time.' Tedder claimed that the boy was clumsy and injured himself . She said that a tear was discovered in the boy’s colon and he had to be transferred to St. George’s Hospital, Tooting, for specialist treatment. The incident led to Tedder being arrested and prosecuted. The defendant denied all the charges against her. Tedder claimed that the boy was clumsy and injured himself. Jailing the defendant, Judge Michael Addison said: 'You deliberately jumped on his stomach. This caused very serious injuries.' He said it would probably never be clear why Tedder had inflicted such violence on the child. Jailed: The cruel 32-year-old appeared at Guildford Crown Court . 'You may have a short temper or a cruel disposition,' added Judge Addison. He said the innocent child might well suffer from long-term psychological damage as a result of his suffering at her hands . The court was told that staff at the victim’s school had already noticed that the boy seemed to suffer cuts and bruising with a greater regularity than was considered normal for a child of his age. 'One of the staff remarked last year that the boy was walking like an old man,' said Ms Durran. Andrew Turton, defending, said his client had never been in trouble with the law before. 'She continues to deny committing these offences which makes mitigation very difficult,' he said. 'These incidents took place against a background of stress,' he added. The child cannot be named for legal reasons.","Rubbed his excrement in his face if he soiled himself .

"A cruel mother is facing up to three years in jail for treating two of her children ‘like dogs’ and locking them in bedrooms so cold they got frostbite. Linda Clappison, 46, routinely locked her son and daughter in a dark room with no bedding and pushed them close to starvation on a diet of chocolate-spread sandwiches while cooking hot food for herself, a court heard. She sent them to work with gypsies on market stalls where they were exploited working up to 12 hours a day. At court: Andrew Clappison, 18, pictured left, said his 'evil' mother Linda Clappison, 46, pictured right, routinely locked him in a room with no heating or lighting and would punch, kick and slap him . The mum-of-four terrorised her youngest children for five years using strangulation and cold baths for punishment. She removed her son’s mattress after . finding him cowering for warmth and humiliated her daughter at school by . forcefully shaving her head five times then made her say she did it . herself to look like Britney Spears. Judge Michael Mettyear said she had . shown no remorse for her actions and told her: 'There is something . wrong. Why you cannot see you have lovely children that most people . would be proud of I do not know. You have put yourself and others in . front of their needs I do not think you will co-operate with the . probation service. You will tell the same lies that you have told the . jury. ‘You seem devoid of any compassion for these children or remorse for what you have done.' He adjourned for a probation report before sentence and added 'a custodial sentence is inevitable. So it is best to start it.' A jury found Clappison of Keyingham, . East Yorkshire, guilty of two charges of cruelty to her daughter, now . 13, from ages six to ten and her son over five years until 2010. The case came to light after the girl went to school one day and told teachers she did not want to go home to her mum. Market place: Andrew Clappison, 18, told a jury his mother would force him to miss school to instead work for free on a gypsy stall in Whitby Market Place. Stock image . Clappison had already fooled a social . services inspection after the girl turned up at school with a black eye. She undid the locks, put the children’s toys downstairs and made it . look like happy families when a social worker called. Andrew Clappison, 18, said his mother . Linda kept him off school more than he went, sending him to working for . gypsies on market stalls after she became infatuated with a gypsy . fortune teller. He told a jury at Hull Crown Court she . changed from being a loving and caring mother-of-four after his father . left home at the age of ten when his mother had an affair. She began spending most of her time . with palm reader Liz Smith and went 'mental' leaving her children with . her family. She would remain at the Smiths home while the children . worked for the gypsies. Clappison never went to the children’s . parents’ evenings at school and would leave her daughter up to two . hours after school finished waiting in the playground. She refused to . meet with Education Welfare Officers and claimed her children - who fell . behind at school - were doing well. Relatives were shocked at how thin . they were. Andrew Clappison said he began to be . locked in his room routinely at night straight after school, eating with . no light bulb and no heating. He said he would have to work for . travellers during the day often falsely getting the blame for things . which went wrong with their families. He said his mother punched, slapped . and kicked him once taking a leather belt to his bottom and once banging . his head against the wall. His worst punishment was being given a cold . bath with his mother holding him under. He said he struggled to hold on to the taps but his mother dug her nails into his veins to force him to let go. Andrew Clappison, 18, told a jury at Hull Crown Court that he was 'scared' of his 'evil' mother who he alleges stopped him going from school and forced him to work on a gypsy market stall . He told a jury: 'I was locked up in my bedroom every time I was a home. I was not able to walk the house.' 'I was scared of her. I had to have my . tea in my room. She would not let me come downstairs. When I wanted to . go to the toilet, I had to ask by knocking on the door and asking to . leave. It was the same if I wanted a drink of water. I was treated like a . dog basically.' He denied claims being locked up was . rare, but said it was routine and said he once smashed his way out, only . for his mother to fit a new lock. He said in January 2010 his mother . removed his bed and blankets from his bedroom making him sleep dressed . only in underpants and he got frost bite. He said his mother removed the . mattress when she caught him trying to keep warm underneath it. He said: 'I was sleeping in the cold . all the time. The boiler was working because it was in my room but I had . no radiator. I used to wake up with blue feet I was that sick. My feet . got frost bite.' He was treated for frost bite in all . of his toes on his left foot and his big toe on his right foot at . hospital. He said his mother told him to say he had been playing outside . in the cold. Crown barrister Mark McKone said . Andrew Clappison’s attendance at school fell to 43 per cent. He said . despite requests for her to attend school Mrs Clappison never answered . the phone and Andrew Clappison never went on school trips. Andrew Clappison said at Christmas his only presents were chocolate and his clothes were gypsy hand-me downs. Clappison faces between three and four years in prison. The judge will sentence in May.","Previously a caring mother-of-four, Linda Clappison, 46, turned into an 'evil' woman when her husband left her .

"Sarah Cullen, 25, was found guilty of shaking Cash Bell to death in Omaha in February 2013 . A former nanny convicted of killing a baby that was in her care has been sentenced to 70 years to life in prison. Sarah Cullen, 25, was found guilty of shaking Cash Bell to death in Omaha in February 2013. Investigators say Cullen gave different accounts of how the baby was injured. She will be eligible for parole after she serves 35 years and sobbed in court as she addressed Cash’s parents. 'If there's anything I could do to take the pain away and bring it on myself I would,' Cullen said. 'I'm so sorry I'll never forgive myself and never expect anyone else to either.' The jury was not able to hear about Cullen's previous abuse of children while at previous day care jobs, but the judge was allowed to use the information for sentencing purposes. Cash's mother, Ashley Bell, asked the judge to send Cullen to prison for life. 'A person capable of committing cold blooded murder and isn't phased doesn't deserve to get out of prison,' Bell explained in court, reported KMTV. 'We held our baby as he died in our arms.  She’s completely heartless.' It took an Omaha jury four hours . to convict Cullen of child abuse resulting in death in the . February 2013 killing of Ashley and Christopher Bell's infant son, Cash. On February 28, 2013, reported the Omaha World Herald, . Christopher Bell and his wife, Ashley, left for work leaving their . perfectly healthy, cooing and giggling son in their baby sitter's care . as usual. Cash Bell (left), died in Omaha in February 2013. Sarah Cullen, 25, (right) was found guilty of shaking him to death. Investigators say Cullen gave different accounts of how the baby was injured . The . Bells told investigators at Douglas County Sheriff's Office that at . about 9.15am, Mr Bell had returned to the Southwest Omaha home to pick up . a check book he had left behind. In . the report he recalled how he had noticed his son lying face down in a . Pack-N-Play with labored breathing and so had rolled the baby onto his . back. Not wanting to disturb him, he had not picked him up. Ms Cullen did scoop up the sleeping . baby, however, and stepped out the front door holding him as Mr Bell pulled out of the driveway to leave. Soon after her employer's departure, . Ms Cullen claims she became worried about the baby's breathing and . called her boyfriend in a panic. By the time he arrived at the house, . she had already administered CPR unsuccessfully and the pair rushed to the . emergency room. Despite a helicopter transfer to Children's Hospital & Medical Center, Cash was unable to recover. Five days later, the infant died from what the autopsy report later described as head fractures resulting in brain hemorrhage. Ashley Bell walks into an Omaha courtroom with her husband, Christopher, by her side in March . Cash's mother, Ashley Bell, asked the judge to send Cullen to prison for life . The . Bells told investigators at Douglas County Sheriff's Office that at . about 9.15am, Mr Bell had returned to the Southwest Omaha home to pick up . a check book he had left behind. The infant's blood vessels burst and blood pooled in his eyes. He was blind and likely deaf. When the Bells were notified . by the doctors that their son had suffered irreparable brain damage, . they made the heart-rending decision to take him off the ventilator. 'A . person capable of committing cold blooded murder and isn't phased . doesn't deserve to get out of prison' Cash Bell's mother Ashley . Over the course of several . interviews, . Ms Cullen gave Chief Deputy Marty Bilek and his team, three divergent . accounts of how Cash might have been injured to such an extent. Initially, . she claimed ignorance and suggested that he may have hit his head when . she took him to say goodbye to Mr Bell. Later she blamed the fracture on . a fall from his baby swing. Finally, she admitted that at around 8am she had tripped on the stairs and Cash had dropped onto the tile floor. In . the course of the trial, it has emerged that the Bells hired Cullen not . knowing that she had been fired from a day care center for being too . rough with the children. Cullen’s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Matt Miller, insisted that his client's actions were accidental. At . one point, Miller drew shocked gasps from the audience when he . suggested that Christopher Bell harmed his son when he turned him over . on his stomach. Omaha World Herald reported that before . the hearing was adjourned, one of the jurors approached Judge Mark . Ashford with an unusual request: could they talk to Mr and Mrs Bell? After . getting the go-ahead from the presiding judge, the four female members . of the panel came up to the Bells and embraced them one by one. ‘We’re so grateful,’ Ashley Bell said as she gave each juror a hug.","Sarah Cullen, 25, was found guilty of shaking Cash Bell to death .

"Predatory: Paedophile Robin Malka, pictured, faces jail after plotting to father a daughter so he could sexually abuse her . A predatory paedophile plotted to 'breed' a daughter he could sexually abuse, a court heard today. Robin Malka, 38, hatched a 'twisted and depraved' plan to father his own victims and feed his sexual obsession with children. French-born Malka said he believed having sex with babies was 'natural and beautiful' and sent sickening images of infants being molested and raped. Malka used the online username 'dom4padeomom' while he chatted with undercover officers 'Stevie' and 'Craig' about abusing two girls aged three and five. He was also a member of sickening internet groups including 'family fun incest' and 'all about incest'. In addition to arranging a child sex offence in November last year, Malka also admitted possessing 721 indecent images, including pictures and movies at level five - the most serious category which includes images of sadism and bestiality. The pervert further admitted distributing more than 30 films and photos. He is now facing a lengthy jail term. Malka was snared by undercover cops at Mile End Tube station in east London on November 13 last year, after revealing his vile intentions in an online chatroom, Southwark Crown Court heard. He was previously jailed for a year in April 2006 with 10 years probation at Miami Circuit Court in the US for possessing indecent images. Prosecutor Peter Zinner told the court: 'His profile disclosed a depraved and twisted plan to meet with a female and breed his own victims for sexual abuse. 'It is clear from what police established through e-chat conversations that he is a real threat to children. 'The content was sexually explicit and leaves one in no doubt that Mr Malka was not only sexually interested in children but that he had abused a child before. In the dock: Malka is facing a lengthy jail term when he is sentenced at Southwark Crown Court . 'Stevie, having realised this was a predatory, determined and possibly active paedophile, suggested she could speak with a friend, Craig, who purported to have two children aged three and five.' Malka talked to 'Craig' about raping the two girls in a conversation on November 6 last year, Mr Zinner said. The following day, he sent Stevie 28 sickening images of babies and very young children being raped. 'He said how he would love to try just about anything with Craig's children and spoke with Stevie about having a baby girl and specific sexual positions while have sex that will give you more chance of having a baby girl. 'He went on to say having sexual relationships with babies and children was a natural and beautiful thing.' Charles Shelton, defending Malka, said he was 'troubled' individual who had a thorny relationship with his mother. 'This was the very unpleasant blurring of fantasy and reality and some doubt must be attached to whether further steps would have been taken.' Malka of Clapham, southwest London, admitted arranging a child sex offence, possessing indecent images of children and ten counts of distributing indecent images of children.","Robin Malka, 38, hatched a plan to father his own victims .

"A woman who allegedly gave birth in a sports pub bathroom and hid her baby in a toilet tank before returning to the bar watch a pay-per-view wrestling match could face the death penalty. Prosecutors will seek the sentence for Amanda Hein, 27, who is accused of suffocating the boy by wrapping him in a plastic bag before hiding him in the toilet at Starters Pub in Lower Saucon Township, Pennsylvania last August. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said that Hein deserves to be executed because she killed a child, according to NBC Philadelphia. CHarges: Amanda Hein, 27, could face the death penalty after she allegedly suffocated her son with a plastic bag in a sports bar toilet and hid his body in a toilet tank . Hein was at the bar with three male friends when she excused herself to go to the bathroom. One of her companions said that she didn't return for an 'extended period of time' and that he and other members of the group text her to see if she was okay. According to Mr Morganelli, Luis Riviera told police that when Hein eventually returned from the toilet she was stained with blood but wouldn't explain what had happened and refused any help. Prosecutors claim that Hein remained at the pub to watch a pay-pre-view wrestling match with the group for another hour before leaving. Facing trial: Hein is charged with criminal homicide and could face the death penalty if convicted because of the age of the baby . Grim: The grisly find at a popular pub shocked residents of the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania . Cleaners found the baby's body the following day when the toilet would not flush. Authorities believe that Hein was in the bathroom for around 40 minutes and cleaned up the stall after giving birth to the baby, who was four to seven weeks premature. Detectives traced Hein after finding traces of her blood in a bar booth. Hein of Allentown will stand trial for criminal homicide. Speaking out after charges were brought against Hein, her biological mother Giesen told The Morning Call she was devastated that her daughter had suffered in silence. 'I just wish she would have even texted me and said, ""Please help me"",' Giesen, of Coopersburg, said. Secret: Hein said she realized she was pregnant in May or June but never told anyone about it . Busy: Starters Pub sports bar was crowded with wrestling fans watching a major pay-per-view match when Hein gave birth in the bathroom . 'I'm her mother and the thing that breaks my heart is she didn't come to me. She didn't ask for help.' Giesen . said her daughter, who had no significant criminal history, documented . domestic abuse or civil judgments due to financial hardship, was 'very . fragile'. 'She told me she thought I hated her and I don't hate her. I love her,' Giesen said. She said she'd tried to get psychiatric help for Hein, but there was little she could do because her daughter was an adult. Giesen, . a born-again Christian, said she and her daughter 'don't see eye to eye . on moral issues' and she didn't approve of Hein's lifestyle or . ex-boyfriend. 'I don't judge her,' Giesen said. 'Anything I didn't agree with I kept to myself, because what was I going to do?' Charged: Detectives traced Hein, 27, after finding traces of her blood in a booth at the sports bar . Horror: This is the toilet where the baby was found wrapped in a trash bag and hidden in the tank . Giesen . said her daughter kept her troubles to herself, including her . pregnancy: 'I don't know what she was going through because she never . told me. She kept that completely to herself.' At the time of the incident, Hein's stepmother, Louiseann . Hein, told The Morning Call that her troubled stepdaughter lived with her and her husband in Allentown, . Pennsylvania for the last six months. She never suspected that Hein, then 26, was pregnant. Mrs Hein said she recalled having a conversation about pregnancy with Hein when the young woman received a piece of mail from Planned Parenthood. 'I told her she always had a home here,' Louiseann Hein told the newspaper, as she struggled to maintain her composure. 'We would make room. Would find a way.'

"A heavily pregnant woman and two accomplices murdered a pensioner with a hammer to get to a safe where they thought he had stashed £30,000. But when Daniel Davies, his stepbrother Troy Schuldt and Davies’ former girlfriend Samantha Smith opened the safe, there was only one dollar inside. Victim Daniel Spires, 69, was lured to a Hertfordshire wood by the two men and throttled with a rope before his head was smashed in with a hammer. Cold-blooded killers: Samantha Smith, left, plotted the brutal murder with her ex-boyfriend Daniel Davies and his stepbrother Troy Schuldt . The trio responsible for the brutal murder were jailed today at St Albans Crown Court for a minimum total of 77 years. Mr Spires, who was nicknamed the 'scrap metal man', had few friends and his killers thought he would not be missed, the court heard. But they confessed to others and were arrested, . more than three months later, after Mr Spires’ remains were found in undergrowth in a wood at Welham Green, where he had been left . by Schuldt and Davies. Smith, 21, of St Albans, was convicted of . murder despite not being at the scene of the killing, and . of obstructing the coroner by not revealing where the body was. The mother of two . was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 21 years. Davies, 24, of St Albans, and . Schuldt, 20, of no fixed address, denied murder . between 12 and 15 June last year, but were convicted and sentenced to . life with a minimum term of 28 years. Smith pleaded guilty to two charges of assisting an offender in relation to Schuldt and was convicted unanimously by the jury of two charges of assisting an offender in relation to Davies. 'Scrap metal man': The defendants did not think Daniel Spires, 69, would be missed, because he had few friends . Schuldt pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and obstructing the coroner. Davies was found guilty of obstructing the coroner. Stuart Trimmer QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said that the partially decomposed body of Mr Spires, who had looked like an 'aged rocker', was found on 24 September last year. The defendants, who at the time were on benefits and all lived in St Albans, had been regular visitors to his address in London Colney near St Albans in the period before his murder. He was last seen with his large and distinctive Mercedes Sprinter van on June 13 last year. Mr Trimmer said: 'He bought and sold items and had a metal safe. It is this safe that appears to be a central feature in the murder. These defendants believed it contained £30,000 in cash. That safe was removed after the murder and has not yet been recovered by the police. 'The murder of Daniel Spires was not a spur of the moment event, but a planned crime specifically to take the money they believed to be in the safe and any other items of value which they could sell.' Emma Blee, who knew the stepbrothers, heard them say they had taken the safe from the wardrobe at Mr Spires’ home in London Colney to discover it contained just a dollar. The safe was never recovered. Schudlt later confessed that Mr Spires was tricked into going with him and Davies to the woods when they said they had some catalytic converters to sell him . 'He was attacked there in the van, but not killed. After being throttled with a rope he was dragged out of the van. The rope was tightened using a hammer handle as a tourniquet.' He was beaten and kicked by Davies and Schuldt hit his head with the hammer until he died. 'They did this some way into the undergrowth and then used some nearby foliage to conceal the body,' said the prosecutor. After finding there was only $1 in the safe, the callous killers sold off Mr Spires’ property for sale. His jewellery was taken from his body along with his keys, wallet and phone. The van was placed for sale on the Gumtree website and was eventually swapped for a red VW Polo by Davies, who then put that for sale on Gumtree. Other items belonging to the dead man that were put up for sale included a pressure washer, a suitcase, generator, a PC, a flat-screen TV, a mini safe and external hard drives. Schuldt told his stepsister Hayley Davies: 'Me and Daniel killed our mate Danny. He was mugging us off so we took him to the woods and did him over.' Schuldt confessed he had hit him with a hammer and they had both kicked and punched him. He  was later seen wearing a chain belonging to the dead man. They were arrested after Keely Charlton, Schuldt’s ex-girlfriend, told a friend what she had learned. She passed the information to a college tutor, who called the police. The prosecutor said Mr Spires was a safe target. If he were to go missing his disappearance would neither be quickly noticed nor reported. 'It was also known that he was going to take a lengthy trip abroad. Daniel Spires was a man who was estranged from his family. He had few friends and counted Daniel Davies as one of them,' he said. Mr Trimmer said Smith’s flat was the base from where the plan was executed. He added: 'Samantha Smith was part of the group trusted with the knowledge of the plan and the execution of it. It started from her flat, it returned to her flat. 'Her flat was the place where all were free to change out of bloody clothes and to dispose of them. Although not at the scene of the murder she was part of its planning and assisted in its execution.' Judge Andrew Bright QC told them: 'You were all three involved in the planning and killing of Daniel Spires in order to break into his property and steal the safe which I am sure you believed contained £30,000. 'I am in no doubt the plan involved throttling him with a rope and, if necessary, finishing him off with a hammer. 'I am quite certain that you, Samantha Smith, knew the co-defendants were off to commit a murder and that you were happy to allow them to use your flat as a base and a safe house.' The judge praised the investigation carried out by the Beds and Herts Major Crime Unit saying: 'This was a complicated and challenging investigation which was put together in an efficient way to be easily understood by the jury.' The judge mentioned in particular DC Katie Jackson, DS Mark Devine and Senior Investigating Officer DI Jerome Kent.","Killers were reduced to selling his belongings for cash .

"The father of Irish journalist Jill Meagher directly addressed his daughter's killer in an Australian courtroom yesterday, telling him: 'It's not okay to rape and murder my child'. Speaking in a strong and steady voice, George McKeon read a heartbreaking victim impact statement to Adrian Bayley at this pre-sentence hearing in Victoria. In stark contrast, the 41-year-old sexual predator cut a cowardly figure in the dock with his head bowed and refused to look Mrs Meagher's family in the eye. The hearing was told how Bayley had been convicted of 22 rapes against six women and was on parole when he attacked the County Louth woman in September last year. Now the premier of the Australian state . of Victoria has ordered a full inquiry into how the serial rapist, who . should have been in jail, was free to kill the 29-year-old. Spoke in a strong and steady voice: George McKeon (left), the father of murdered Irish journalist Jill Meagher (right) directly addressed his daughter's killer in an Australian courtroom at his pre-sentence hearing . Sexual predator: Mrs Meagher's killer Adrian Bayley had been convicted of 21 rapes against six women and was on parole when he attacked the 29-year-old in September last year, Victoria Supreme Court heard . The hearing also heard an account from her husband, Tom Meagher, who was too devastated to read his victim impact statement himself. It told how his life was destroyed on the night Bayley attacked his beautiful young wife as she walked alone to her Melbourne home. Bayley, now 41, was 18 years old when he raped his first victim – a 16-year-old friend of his own sister. And he has committed more sex crimes over the past two decades. Mr Meagher told the hearing yesterday how he is still haunted by the fact he was not able to tell his 29-year-old wife that he loved her in her last moments. 'My love, my best friend, my entire world': Husband Tom Meagher (pictured with his wife on their wedding day, left, and on a trip, right) told in a victim impact statement how his life had been destroyed by his wife's death . Targeted: Mrs Meagher (pictured with her brother Michael on her wedding day) was attacked by Bayley as she walked home alone to her Melbourne home . The statement, read to the court by a . spokesman, said: ‘The knowledge that those last moments were terrifying . and painful and the knowledge that with her final walk she had crossed . paths with evil haunts me every day.’ He . said, ‘my love, my best friend and my entire world’ had been stolen, as . well as ‘the possibility of a family and our lives together’. He added: . ‘I am half a person because of this crime. I think of the waste of a . brilliant mind... at the hands of a grotesque and soulless human being.’ Bayley . has already pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Mrs Meagher, after . he attacked her in a lane in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick on . September 22 last year, as she walked home after socialising with . colleagues from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The hearing at Victoria’s Supreme Court . that Bayley had previously been found guilty of 21 rape offences and . was on parole for attacking five prostitutes when he assaulted the . County Louth woma in September last year. In . 2002, Bayley was sentenced to 11 years for raping five prostitutes, but . was freed on parole in 2011, which would have lasted until March this . year. Grief-stricken: Mr McKeon (centre) reacts after he releases doves with his wife Edith (left), Mrs Meagher's husband Tom (second right) and her brother Michael (second left) at her funeral in Melbourne in October . Predator: Bayley is led into a prison van at the Supreme Court in Melbourne in April after pleading guilty to the rape and murder Mrs Meagher . Cowardly: Bayley, 41, cowers in the back of a polcie car just after Australian homicide detectives charged him with the rape and murder of Mrs Meagher in September . In February last year, . he was sentenced to three months for assaulting a man and should have . been sent back to jail, but he appealed it and was released – enabling . him to rape and strangle Jill. Now the parole board has been criticised for not taking action just months before Bayley turned killer. Denis . Napthine – premier of the state of Victoria, where Melbourne is the . capital – is ‘astounded’ that Bayley was free to roam the streets and . has ordered an inquiry. He admitted: ‘There is no doubt the system . failed Jill Meagher.’ In Mr McKeon's victim impact statement, he told hown which the 55-year-old told how his daughter travelled home to see him after he had a stroke last September. He said she made him promise to get better as she wanted her children to have ‘a young granddad to run around with’. He said: ‘Every young child, small baby less than three months old, they just remind me of Jillian and they remind me of what would have been, that by now, Jillian would be three to four months’ pregnant.’ Tragic: Flowers were placed outside of Duchess Boutique in Sydney Road, Melbourne, the last place Jill Meagher was seen alive via CCTV footage . Crime scene: Forensic police inspect the body of Australian Broadcasting Corporation employee Jill Meagher in Gisborne South, north of Melbourne, Australia in September last year . Her mother Edith was unable to attend the hearing due to illness, but her statement was read out to the court. She said: ‘My life stopped on September 22, 2012. I have been shocked to the core of my being. I can no longer live an ordinary life and my heart suffers from the deepest wound from which it will never recover.’ In court yesterday chief prosecutor Gavin Silbert told the judge that Bayley killed Mrs Meagher because he knew he would face a term of up to 20 years for raping her. ‘Accordingly, he [felt] he had no option but to kill her,’ Mr Silbert said. But the court heard Bayley told a psychologist that after raping Ms Meagher, he held her down ‘for long enough to kill her’ because she retaliated and threatened to tell police. ‘It is much more likely that this was a rage-based response to what was occurring, as opposed to being a rational assessment of the need to dispose of a witness, if I can put it in that blunt and rather inappropriate way,’ defence counsel Saul Holt, SC, said. In a letter read out in court, Bayley offered an apology. The claimed he was not seeking forgiveness and realised he deserved a sentence of life imprisonment. However, his defence lawyer asked for a lenient sentence so that he could rehabilitate. But Mr Silbert said Bayley only confessed after he was ‘backed into a corner’. Justice Geoff Nettle will sentence Bayley next Wednesday.","George McKeon spoke in a strong and steady voice to Adrian Bayley .

"The opening statements have begun in the case against a newlywed who allegedly pushed her husband to his death off a cliff just eight days after their wedding, with the prosecutor painting the wife as having major doubts about her relationship. Cody Johnson was found dead at the bottom of a steep cliff in Glacier National Park after falling ‘face first’ to his death on July 7. His wife Jordan Graham, 22, is now on trial for his murder and will be called to explain why she lied to family, friends and the police for days by saying Johnson disappeared after driving off with friends. Running out of allies: The teenage brother of Jordan Graham, seen leaving court on Monday, broke down on the stand today as he told how he grew frustrated with her changing stories during her husband's disappearance . Assistant U.S. Attorney Kris McLean showed jurors a smiling Johnson posing for a picture, then minutes later put up a photograph of his body lying face-down in a pool of water at the bottom of a steep cliff below a popular spot in the park called The Loop. 'There were only two people on this cliff when the defendant pushed Cody Johnson off,' McLean said. Graham has pled not guilty to first-degree murder, second-degree murder and making a false statement to authorities. McLean told the jury that because there were no witnesses, prosecutors would rely on the testimony of friends and relatives of the couple to show Graham's state of mind before and after Johnson's death to prove that she is guilty of his murder. Andy Nelson, Graham's public defender, said Graham had finally worked up the nerve to talk to Johnson about her grave doubts about their wedding, but their argument ended in a tragic accident when he grabbed her during their fight and she pushed him to remove his hand. 'Arguing on this small ledge was like arguing in a phone booth,' Nelson said. Excited: Cody Johnson's mother testified in court about how her son was excited to marry Jordan . 'Jordan lied because she was afraid no one would ever let her explain what happened on that ledge.' Prosecutors presented jurors with dozens of text messages between Graham and her friend from church, Kimberly Martinez, that documented how Graham's nervous excitement at the prospect of the wedding turned into despair over the week that followed. Graham wrote in one text the day after the wedding that she was 'completely second guessing everything right now.' The day after that, she wrote that she couldn't pull herself together. A third message said she wished somebody would have asked her if the marriage was what she wanted, and that all she wanted was to be herself again. 'Something was wrong,' Martinez told the jury. 'I couldn't tell if she was unhappy or something happened.' Graham was a naive, immature and shy woman who deals better with the children she watched over as a nanny than with most adults, Nelson said. Explain herself: Jordan, seen here at an October court appearance, will be faced with the task of explaining her bizarre behavior in the days after her husband's death when she lied to family, friends and the police . Downward spiral: Her defense attorneys are now arguing that Graham, seen here dancing with her husband at their wedding just eight days before his death, was having post-wedding 'blues' She was awkward around Johnson's friends, and she sensed they didn't like her, so she avoided them, the lawyer said. In pretrial statements, her defense attorneys wrote that on the day of Johnson’s death, Graham ‘felt compelled to tell Cody about her wedding blues’. They were married June 29, about two years after they started dating. Johnson's friend, Jennifer Toren, said he was crazy about Graham. 'He was willing to do anything for her,' Toren said. But almost immediately, Graham started having 'the wedding blues,' McLean said. That is when the text messages with Martinez intensified, and they showed she planned to confront him July 7 after church and dinner. McLean said the couple took their argument to the park and descended below a retaining wall along the roadway to the ledge. There, Graham pushed Johnson in the back with both hands and he fell face-first over the cliff, McLean said. Friends say that Graham cried uncontrollably on the day of the wedding . Family friend Tracey Maness said Johnson (pictured) was excited about his wedding and in love with Graham . She then drove home without seeking help and sent text messages to friends that planted stories about Johnson's disappearance and talked about her dance moves for an upcoming party, the prosecutor said. She lied to his friends and her own family about his disappearance. She showed authorities a fabricated email from a person named 'Tony' that said Johnson was dead and they should call off the search. The next day, she led authorities to his body, saying that she knew he liked to hike in that spot with his buddies, McLean said. Graham's attorney said she was running from the reality of the situation that she had found herself in. Graham left Glacier Park alone and her husband wasn't reported missing until he didn't show up for work . In her naivete, she came up with a ridiculous, implausible story to deflect attention from herself. 'Jordan did not want to report this accident because she was afraid,' Nelson said. She finally admitted that she was with Johnson when an FBI investigator confronted her with a picture of Johnson's car with a man and a woman inside at the gates of Glacier National Park. In that interview, she acknowledged her role in his death, though she said it was an accident, Nelson said. U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy said he hoped to get the trial to the jury this week because he has a trial scheduled to start next Monday in Billings.","Jordan Linn Graham and Cody Lee Johnson were married only eight days before the couple had a fight resulting in Johnson's death .

"Locked up for life: Goidsargi Estibaliz Carranza Zabala murdered both her husband and lover and then burying their dismembered bodies in the cellar . A woman dubbed 'The Ice Cold Killer' is accused of murdering both her husband and lover and then burying their dismembered bodies in the cellar. Austria has been gripped by the trial of ice-cream seller Goidsargi Estibaliz 'Esti' Carranza which began yesterday in Vienna amid a sea of publicity. It is the third criminal investigation . featuring basements in Austria in recent years, following on from the . Natascha Kampusch and Josef Fritzl cases. Prosecutors in Vienna yesterday dubbed her 'singularly cold-blooded' as they described how the men in her life were killed, their bodies hacked up with a chain saw, bagged into plastic rubbish sacks and then cemented in concrete next to the ice cream tubs in her cellar. Carranza, who has joint Spanish-Mexican citizenship, is charged with shooting dead her husband, Holger Holz, in 2008 and in 2010 her new partner, Manfred Hinterberger, with a .22 Beretta pistol. She switched on ice cream-making equipment in her Schlekeria cafe to drown out the noise of the chain saw as she cut them into pieces. She prepared herself well for the killings and later disposal of the corpses - first she took lessons in marksmanship followed by a night school course in 'the mixing and application of concrete'. The gruesome remains were discovered by chance during maintenance work in June 2011. After going on the run to Italy, Carranza was captured several days afterwards and extradited. When arrested, Carranza was two-months pregnant by another man, whom she married in prison in March this year. The baby was born in January but the boy was immediately taken away from her and is now reportedly being looked after by Carranza's parents in Barcelona. A psychiatric report commissioned by the court said that Carranza, now in a unit for the 'mentally abnormal', was dangerous and was like a 'princess ... who just wants to be 'rescued' by a man'. 'She intends to confess. She has already told the court-appointed expert everything that she did, as she also did when she was arrested by the Italian police,' said Werner Tomanek, one of her defence lawyers. Victims: Carranza, who has joint Spanish-Mexican citizenship, is charged with shooting dead her husband, Holger Holz, left, and her new partner, Manfred Hinterberger, right, . Grim: Zabala switched on ice cream-making equipment in her Schlekeria cafe to drown out the noise of the chain saw as she cut her victims into pieces . Immediately after disposing of Hinterberger, she booked an 'urgent manicure appointment' in order to repair her damaged nails, the court heard. 'This woman has two faces,' prosecutor Petra Freh told the packed courtroom. 'She will try to play here the part of someone well-behaved, who would never do something like this. 'My task is to show you her other side ... That she is a singularly cold-blooded and unscrupulous killer,' Freh said. 'Do not be fooled.' Wearing a grey dress and glasses, Carranza showed no emotion as the accusations against her were read out. The trial was scheduled to last several days, with around 50 witnesses and seven experts due to testify.  She reportedly will claim both men had abused her physically and psychologically. A verdict is expected next week. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Austria has been gripped by the trial of .

"It's shaping up to be one of the tightest U.S. presidential elections in history. But it seem there would be one clear winner if the rest of the world were to get to vote. A poll of more than 570,000 people across the globe has revealed non-Americans want Barack Obama to remain President of the United States. Head to head: President Barack Obama, left, is more popular around the globe than US Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, right, according to a new survey . Research, conducted across 36 countries outside the US, revealed 81 per cent were in favour of Obama spending another four years in office. And only 19 per cent preferred his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, according to the findings from MSN. Interestingly, the only country that would prefer Romney as the next President was China - with 52 per cent voting in his favour. In the UK, Obama came out with a huge 85 per cent of the vote. Down to the wire: President Barack Obama rallies support during a campaign stop, today, ahead of Tuesday's election . Final push: Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney arrives at a campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, today, in the last push for votes before the 57th U.S. election . Romney's failure to win fans here has been put down to his comments over Britain being unready for the Olympics this summer. Duncan Hooper, managing editor of MSN News & Sport, said: 'Mitt Romney lost all hope of winning Britons' hearts after suggesting the country wasn't ready to host the Olympics. 'He made so many gaffes during a visit to London that it became known as the ""Romneyshambles"".

"The mother of a toddler who suffered a . brain injury and burns cried in court on Thursday as a Massachusetts court was shown . videos of her son cowering and being yelled at. The footage was taken in November 2012 just before Jessica Linscott and her boyfriend Roland Dow left her son at a hospital and fled to Florida. The 25-year-old, who is already in prison for child endangerment charges and witness tampering, testified against Dow who is on trial for allegedly beating and burning her son. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Jessica Linscott cried in court on Thursday as she testified that Roland Dow struck her son in the head when he had a seizure . Trial: Roland Dow, pictured in court Thursday, is accused of severely beating and burning his girlfriend's son . She told the court she witnessed Dow strike her son in the head when he had seizures, and admitted that she didn't comfort her son. Linscott claimed in court that Dow physically and mentally abused her, and treated her son 'worse than a dog you don't want'. 'I allowed . a lot of things to happen that I shouldn't have let happen. I was being . a horrific parent,' she said. 'I was neglecting my son's needs. I was . putting Roland first and letting him take control of every situation.' The mother claimed her boyfriend hated her child, and punished him at the slightest provocation. If her son soiled his clothes, Dow would make him go in the shower to rinse off, . holding him down and spraying him with water. Sometimes, the frantic . toddler fell in the tub and got hurt as he struggled, she said. 'No . matter what my son was doing, he was doing it wrong [in Dow's eyes],' she said. 'My son . couldn't color the right way, he couldn't eat the right way, he . couldn't talk the right way.' Threat: Linscott, who is serving a sentence for child endangerment, says her boyfriend had physically abused her and her child . Abuse: The three-year-old boy was treated in hospital for burns and a brain injury . On the run: Dow and Linscott were arrested at a Florida theme park two weeks after leaving Linscott's son at a hospital and fleeing . Linscott said she let Dow abuse and terrify James in part because she feared he would do something even worse if she left him. Linscott, who is serving a two and a half to seven-year prison sentence, told the court she had filmed her son so she could show doctors his behavior. She claimed she believed he was having 'autistic fits' on purpose, and worried there was something seriously wrong with him. In one video, which was filmed just a few days before her son was taken to hospital, he is seen stumbling and complaining that he had a 'tummy ache'. Later, he was seen in the video cowering in a bathtub while being yelled at to stop having seizures. In other videos, the three-year-old appeared stiff and unresponsive as he was sat on the toilet, or put in the bathtub. Coached: In one video, not pictured, the child was filmed as Dow taught him what to say to social workers . Witness: Linscott testified against her boyfriend Dow, who is facing charges of assaulting her son . Arrest: The couple were arrested and charged over the alleged abuse suffered by Linscott's young son . The jury was also shown a video of the couple preparing James for a social worker's . visit in 2012. The video, which Linscott said Dow shot from . under a couch, doesn't clearly show the couple or the boy, but their . voices could be heard. Dow . is heard asking James, 'Do you like being here?', 'Anybody ever spank . you?', and 'Ever go in the shower when you're really bad?'. The little boy can be heard answering softly, 'yeah,' 'no' and 'no.' When he was asked: 'If someone said I hit you, are they lying?' Dow answered himself with a stern 'Yes'. Dow then could be heard saying to the boy: 'Hey, give me a hug. We're best friends, right?' The . couple fled to Florida after leaving the toddler at a hospital in . November 2012. They were arrested at a theme park two weeks later. During their absence, Linscott's son had been treated for a brain injury and burns on his wrist and fingers. The boy was 'beaten to the point where . he almost lost his life,' according to Massachusetts Live, which saw a court motion filed by . Rockingham County Assistant District Attorney Patricia Conway. The . child, who is now five years old, is now being cared for by Linscott's . mother. His father had died of a drug overdose before the alleged abuse . began. Denial: Dow, pictured at his arraignment in 2012, has pleaded not guilty to the abuse charges . Tears: Linscott wiped her eyes after breaking down during her arraignment in 2012 . Dow's . defense attorneys claimed in court that Linscott has a history of falsely accusing others . when she felt threatened. She testified that she lied to doctors and . police before fleeing to Florida, but told the truth when a detective . questioned her about the black eye Dow gave her while they were on the . run. Linscott . said she was afraid to take her son and leave Dow because he had hit . her, ripped out her hair, repeatedly choked her and once threw her down . the stairs. Although she did leave for three days when he threatened to . slit her throat, she said she returned after he said he would kill . himself.

"Most wanted: Warwick Spinks, a violent paedophile who was on the run for 15 years, has been arrested at Heathrow Airport after he was found in the Czech Republic . A violent paedophile who was on the run for 15 years has been found in the Czech Republic and arrested after a major international manhunt, a child protection unit has today confirmed. Warwick Andrew Spinks, 48, was arrested at Heathrow Airport after he was tracked down by officers from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop). The 48 year old had used various aliases while on the run, including Willem Van Wijk and William Spinks. His horrifying back catalogue of abuse led to his nickname 'the Pied Piper of Paedophiles' after he bragged he could arrange sex with young boys for as little as 10p. He was convicted in 1995 of a series of sexual offences against boys, including serious sexual assault at knifepoint, taking a child without lawful authority and taking indecent images of children. He was jailed for seven years but this was reduced to a five-year term on appeal. In 1997, while on release on licence, Spinks went missing and fled the UK. He now faces serving the remaining 18 months of his sentence. Ceop chief executive Peter Davies said: 'Ceop officers, in conjunction with officers at the Metropolitan Police Service and Soca (Serious Organised Crime Agency), have worked tirelessly over a number of years to locate and trace a high-risk child sexual offender, who believed he could avoid being managed in the UK by travelling overseas. Then and now: Abuser was first investigated in . 1992  (left) after police suspected he had links with paedophile rings . in the UK and Europe. Spinks (pictured right) after his arrest on Friday . Finally caught: Spinks, 48, was arrested at Heathrow Airport after he was tracked down by officers from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) 'I hope this arrest sends a clear message to other missing child sexual offenders that however far you travel to avoid facing the consequences of your actions, we will track you down and bring you to justice.' The abuser was first investigated in 1992, after police suspected he had links with paedophile rings in the UK and Europe. He acted as a 'fixer' in Amsterdam, the Sunday People reports, where he introduced sex tourists looking for underage boys. He told undercover officers from the Metropolitan and Dutch police he could pick up young boys from German, Prague and Poland for as little as 10p. He was also caught on secret camera offering to supply a video in which a 10 year old boy was killed and one featuring the horrific abuse of a young boy. When Spinks was sentenced in 1995 at Lewes Crown Court for a string of offences against under-age boys, the court heard how he drugged a 14 year old boy and 'sold him' to a gay brothel in Amsterdam.

"A couple who were spared jail after they broke a toddler’s leg, foot and arms will have their sentence reviewed by the Government after a petition to put them behind bars was started - by a disgusted friend. Emma Cartwright and partner Neil Gleaves, both 27, left the injured youngster for two days before taking the child to hospital. Cartwright was also convicted of slapping a baby in the face before Gleaves violently shook it. A judge sparked national outrage after he handed the couple, from Wolstanton, Staffordshire, suspended sentences of two years because it was their first offence and Gleaves was 'hardworking'. Spared . jail: Emma Cartwright, 27, and her partner Neil Gleaves, also 27, were . given a 36-week prison sentence suspended for two years after being . convicted of child cruelty and neglect. But a petition, signed by 1,000, could see them put behind bars . Recorder Simon Ward also ordered Gleaves to complete 100 hours of unpaid work when they were convicted on May 24. Now their sentence could be reviewed after 1,000 people signed a petition calling on the pair to be jailed. The online petition was started by Cartwright’s former friend Nicola Linyard. Ms Linyard, 29, also from Wolstanton, was so appalled at the lenient sentence she also wrote to the Government demanding the couple were jailed. The Attorney General today asked the Crown Prosecution Service to pass on details about the case. A decision will then be made on whether to send the case to the Court of Appeal for a sentence review. A spokesman for the Attorney . General’s Office said: 'We have asked the CPS for more information to . decide whether the sentence should be referred to the Court of Appeal . for review. 'The power to refer sentences is subject to a strict 28-day time limit from the day of sentencing. 'This case is within that time limit and either the attorney or the solicitor general will make their decision in due course.' The couple could be jailed for a maximum of ten years. At the lower end of the scale, the . guidelines state a sentence of anything between 12 weeks in custody to a . community order can be imposed for offences involving short-term . neglect or ill-treatment, a single incident of short-term abandonment or . a failure to protect a child. Staff found the toddler's leg had been broken for at least two days before it was brought in to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire . Ms Linyard, who started the petition . after she acted as a prosecution witness during the trial, said: 'People . here are absolutely disgusted with the sentence and they both deserve . to be jailed. 'The sentence is unbelievable. It’s like the judge is sending out a message to say that it’s OK to be cruel to children. 'Drink-drivers get sent straight down, but these two have been allowed to walk free. 'I’m glad the Attorney General has listened to the protests and I hope it leads to them being given a proper sentence - in prison.' Alan Knipe-Smith, landlord of the Eagle and Child pub in nearby Chesterton, said: 'Gleaves used to come here but he’s certainly not welcome anymore. 'To say it’s their first offence can hardly be a reason to treat them leniently. What they did is disgusting and they should have been jailed.' Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard X-rays revealed the child had suffered a catalogue of fractures to both arms, both legs, the left foot and left shoulder. At the trial, Recorder Ward told them: 'You’ve both been convicted of very serious offences and you’re going to have to live with the consequences. 'Offences of cruelty and ill-treatment of children are so serious that the courts have to send out a message to people that, if convicted, serious sentences will follow.' The couple were spared jail after the judge heard how the defendants had no previous convictions. Nick . Tatlow, defending, also said Cartwright had experienced a 'troubled' past and had been cared for by 14 different foster families as a child. He said: 'Her actions amounted to a temporary loss of temper.' Anis . Ali, defending Gleaves added: 'He is, and was, a hard-working . individual. He understands the consequences of this conviction will last . forever.' The court heard the couple attacked . the toddler, who was taken to University Hospital of North Staffordshire . with serious injuries. On arriving at hospital, shocked doctors found the child’s right leg had been broken at least two days earlier. David . Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'Neither defendant could account for how . that injury was caused. The medical staff were concerned and a full . radiological survey was carried out. 'The whole body was X-rayed and it was discovered the child had a number of significant injuries to its bones. 'The . child had fractures to both arms, both legs, left foot and left . shoulder, all of which, it was deemed by the medical staff, were . non-accidental injuries and were caused deliberately to the child.' Cartwright and Gleaves have now fled the area.","Child had broken leg for at least two days before it was taken to hospital .

"Two days after Tanilla Warrick-Deaves should have turned five, her mother’s ex-boyfriend was found guilty of murdering her. The two-year-old was being beaten to death by Warren James Ross, 30, in her mother’s home on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia, after he became frustrated that the little girl was not toilet-trained. Ross abused Tanilla in the weeks leading up to her death in August 2011 as he used brutal methods to try to toilet-train her, forcing her to run laps, whipping her with various implements and hitting her. Tanilla Warrick-Deaves, 2, was murdered in 2011 by her mother's boyfriend, Warren James Ross, because she was not toilet-trained . The violence escalated with Ross striking the toddler repeatedly, banging her head on a glass shower screen and a cupboard door. The beatings were so severe that she lay unconscious in a pram for two days until she eventually stopped breathing. The girl’s mother, Donna Deaves, witnessed the abuse but did not intervene or call for medical assistance as her daughter lay unconscious. She was found guilty of manslaughter last year and was sentenced to 12 years prison, which was reduced to nine years after she agreed to give testimony against Ross, her former partner. Ross was convicted in December last year after a harrowing six-week trial. During the trial Ross remained defiant, using offensive language toward members of the media and making threats to a man sitting next to his mother. When the jury delivered the guilty verdict he yelled: ‘It’s not over,’ before breaking down in tears, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Ross was in court again this week as those close to Tanilla read victim impact statements to the judge before sentencing. The girl’s father, Adrian Warrick, who has Tanilla’s name tattooed on his arm told the NSW Supreme Court he had gone through ‘every parent’s worst nightmare’ and he could not understand why Ross abused his daughter because she was not toilet trained as quickly as he wanted. ‘Why was it so important to punish her so harsh that it took her life? ‘I can only imagine what Tanilla went through and the fear she faced through her ... ordeal.’ ‘What did she do so bad that gave you the right to hurt Tanilla? None whatsoever. She was a defenceless child,’ the Sydney Morning Herald reported him saying. Warren James Ross (left) has been convicted of Tanilla's murder. Tanilla's mother, Donna Deaves, (right) was convicted of manslaughter after she did not intervene to stop her boyfriend killing the two-year-old . 'No words for the heartache': Adrian Warrick (right), father of Tanilla Warrick-Deaves, and partner Brooke Bowen leaving the murder trial of Warren Ross in December 2013 . While Mr Warrick was delivering his victim impact statement, the toddler’s killer was defiant. He stood up and shouted abuse at the girl’s father. ‘F*** you Adrian, you dog,’ Ross yelled from the dock. ‘Where were you for two years?’ Court officers surrounded the dock until Ross sat down. Tanilla’s two sisters, who cannot be identified, also wrote victim impact statements that were read on their behalf. ‘You have killed my baby sister,’ one said. ‘You have scarred me for life.’ The other one said she was ‘angry because you have made the baddest thing to have happened,’ reported The Australian. Tanilla’s father asked Justice Stephen Rothman to give Ross ‘a lengthy sentence or possibly life if that allows.’ Outside the court on Friday after delivering his statement, Mr Warrick said he hoped that Ross would never be released. ‘That's what my daughter deserves. Any child does. For what she had to go through ... such a person doesn't deserve to see the light of day in my eyes.’ His partner Brooke Bowen said Tanilla was a ‘beautiful little girl’. ‘People talk about closure but there's no such thing as closure. Today was a bit of acceptance of that she's never coming back,’ she told reporters. Sentencing will continue in May. Adrian Warrick is interviewed outside court this week. He is wearing a shirt with a picture of his daughter on it, with a caption reading 'Stand up don't give up'","Tanilla Warrick-Deaves murdered in her mother's home in NSW, Australia .

"The new Pope's diplomatic skills were put to the test yesterday as he met his old foe, Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner and she asked him to intervene over the Falkland Islands. The Argentinian leader seized her chance during a lunchtime meeting with Pope Francis I, who is South America's first Pope, at his temporary home on the edge of the Vatican gardens. Ms Kirchner, who has a long history of disputes with the Pope over her her socially liberal policies, met the Pope at the Vatican hotel a day before his formal installation Mass as Pope. Scroll down for video . The Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner and Pope Francis I have been at odds before, most notably over the issue of gay marriage . After the three-hour meeting - the new Pope's first with a . head of state - Ms Kircnher told reporters: 'I asked for his intervention on the question of the Malvinas. 'I asked for his intervention to avoid problems that could emerge from the militarisation of Great Britain in the south Atlantic. 'We want a dialogue and that's why we asked the Pope to intervene so that the dialogue is successful.' Earlier this month, the islanders . voted overwhelmingly to remain a British Overseas Territory.  It is now . known how the Pope responded to Ms Kirchner, but before he was Pope he . has been quoted as saying that Britain had 'usurped' the islands from . Argentina. Ms Kirchner also presented the Pope with a mate gourd - a sort of traditional tea urn - and a straw, from . which he could drink his favourite Argentinian tea. Afterwards the Argentinian leader said the Pope had kissed her to thank her for the gift form his native country, saying: 'Never in my life has a Pope kissed me'. After the Pope thanked Ms Kirchner for her presents, she exclaimed 'Never in my life has a Pope kissed me' A gift from home: Ms Kirchner presented the Pope with a traditional mate gourd and straw to drink tea from . Today world leaders will gather in . Rome to attend his installation Mass in St Peter's Square, among them . Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, a practising Catholic. Banned from travelling in Europe in protests at the human rights record in his southern African nation, the 89-year-old is exempted for trips to the Vatican. In 2005, Mugabe joined world leaders at the funeral of Pope John II. US vice president Joe Biden has also flown to Rome for the Mass, where he will represent the American delegation.  Yesterday he was photographed reviewing the guard of honour at the Palazzo Chigi with the outgoing Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti. After yesterday's meeting between Francis I and Ms Kirchner, the two Argentinians had lunch together - a meal that might have been awkward, given their long history of disagreements. The feisty Argentinian premier arrived bearing gifts for the Pope, before asking for his help over the Falklands . The 76-year-old Pontiff, who was born in Buenos Aires, has previously clashed with the Argentinian premier over her socially liberal policies and with what he has called her government's 'totalitarianism'. Ms Kirchner and her predecessor and late husband, Nestor Kirchner, defied church teaching to push through sex education in schools, free contraception, and the right for transsexuals to change their official identities. In 2010 Argentina became the first Latin American country to legalise gay marriage, when the now-Pope was then Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio.  According to his biographer, he knew the church wouldn't win a fight against it, so he urged his bishops to lobby for gay civil unions instead. Seized her chance: The Argentinian President asked the Pope for help on the eve of his inauguration Mass in Rome . Cristina Kirchner, left, with the Pope, and US vice president Joe Biden, on the left with Italian PM Mario Monti . But when the bishops shot down his proposal, the Cardinal declared what gay activists called a 'war of God' on the measure, and the church lost the issue altogether. The chilly relations between the pair became apparent a few years ago when Ms Kirchner and her late husband stopped attending the church's annual Te Deum address challenging society to do better. In last year's address, Bergoglio said . Argentina was being harmed by demagoguery, totalitarianism, corruption . and efforts to secure unlimited power: a strong message to a country . whose president has ruled by decree and left scandals unpunished. Souvenir makers have been busy as more than a million visitors are expected to see the new Pope in Rome . More recently, a degree of silence was noted on Ms Kirchner's normally-chatty Twitter account when the Argentinian was elected Pope last week. She posted just one Tweet all day, saying 'To your Holiness Francis I' and linking to her letter of congratulations, which wasn't even signed. Vatican-watchers said the choice of venue for yesterday's meeting was unusual, given Francis has technically taken possession of the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace, where such formal audiences are usually held. However he has conducted all of his audiences in the hotel to date, including with one with the Vatican secretary of state. Rows of chairs have been laid out ahead of tomorrow's Mass where Pope Francis I will be formally installed as leader of the Roman Catholic church . The Vatican said it planned no statement, describing the meeting as private and informal. The meeting with Ms Kirchner is just a warm-up for the new Pope, given the number of world heads descending on Rome for his installation Mass today. More than 120 official delegations will witness Francis I's formal installation as the 266th leader of the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church. Italian media say Rome civil protection authorities are expecting more than a million people to attend the Mass, numbers not seen since the beatification of Pope John Paul II in 2011 which drew 1.5 million to St. Peter's and the surrounding streets. One significant VIP is the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I. The new Pope's low-key style has been evident from the start: Here he waded into the crowd to meet people . His presence at the installation is the first from the Istanbud-based Patriarchate since the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches split in the Great Schism nearly 1,000 years ago. Also arriving in Rome yesterday was Taiwanese President President Ma Ying-jeou, in what is a rare European foray for the head of the diplomatically isolated island that underscores the tricky nature of its relations with China and the Vatican. As he arrived in Italy he said: 'We want to have much better relations with the Vatican and I think we will.' The Taiwanese President said the new Pope was a 'wonderful person', adding: 'I think he'll do a very good job.' Taiwan has full diplomatic relations with only 23 countries, most of them in Latin America, Africa, and the south Pacific. Its only diplomatic ally in Europe is the Vatican, though even that tie remains tenuous. The Vatican has long expressed a willingness to transfer its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, though it has made that conditional on China allowing its Catholics to worship freely, without Communist Party restrictions. China has congratulated the new pope on his election, but said that establishing formal relations would depend on the Vatican cutting ties with Taipei and ceasing activities Beijing considers interference in its internal affairs. Pope Francis' informal style got the better of him when he telephoned a Vatican receptionist directly and was told: 'And I'm Napoleon.' The new pope, according to Croatian religious website Bitno.net, had announced himself when he called a Jesuit residence in Rome on Friday and got through to the switchboard. He had been trying to contact Adolfo Nicolas, the superior general of the Pope's old Jesuit order. But the baffled receptionist - identified only as Andreas - thought someone was playing a trick on him and quipped back: 'Oh yes? And I'm Napoleon.' His holiness eventually got through, after managing to convince the receptionist he was genuine saying: 'I really am Pope Francis.' One Vatican expert explained: 'You can't really blame the poor man.  No other pope would have picked up a telephone to make their own calls.  An official usually calls a secretary who places the call. 'The receptionist is extremely distraught but I think the new pope has a good sense of humour and will laugh it off,' they added.","Request came at Pope Francis' first meeting with head of state yesterday .

"Mother of two Irina Gaidamachuk dubbed 'Satan in a Skirt', posed as a social worker to gain entry to the flats of her victims. After securing their trust, the 41-year-old killed them by smashing their skulls with a hammer or an axe. Then she robbed her victims, who were between 61- and 89-years-old, for the small amounts of cash in their purses. 'Satan in a skirt': Convicted killer Irina Gaidamachuk told police she battered 17 pensioners to death so she could steal their cash and feed her vodka addiction . In all her murders, police say she only gathered a total of around £1,000 from her victims. Sometimes she killed for as little as £20. She confessed to police: 'I did it for money. I just wanted to be a normal mum, but I had a craving for drink. 'My husband Yury wouldn't give me money for vodka.' A court in Yekaterinburg, which is Russia's fourth biggest city, heard evidence from psychiatrists that she was sane when she committed her murders. Reign of terror: Russian police eventually managed to produced an artist impression of the serial killer after initially believing a man was responsible, left, and Irina Gaidamachuk, right, before her arrest . Only one pensioner managed to escape, giving police the vital clue that the granny killer was a woman. A police source said: 'We believed at first that only a man could be so cruel as to slaughter in this way.' In fact, during a bungled investigation, in which the town of Krasnoufimsk was living in fear, officers also believed the killer could be a man dressed as a woman. They also arrested the wrong woman, Irina Valeyeva, then 29, extracting a confession from an entirely innocent person. After questioning more than 3,000 people they finally arrested the real killer in 2010. Sentence: Irina Gaidamachuk, right, outside the court where she was sentenced to 20 years - a sentence which some of her victim's relatives have described as insufficient for her crimes . In custody: Irina Gaidamachuk, left, being questioned by police - the killer confessed to her crimes to officers, claiming she was motivated by her need to get money to buy vodka . For her final victim instead of posing as a social worker, she offered to redecorate 81-year-old Alexandra Povaritsyna's flat. After she bludgeoned the pensioner to death, neighbours gave a description of the painter and police arrested her. Gaidmachuk was known as an ordinary mother, who helped out at her younger daughter Anastasia's school. Violent: Mother of two and violent murderer Irina Gaidamachuk, right, in court behind a perspex screen and under guard as the details of her horrendous crimes are outlined . One friend said: 'I simply cannot believe Irina is a mass murderer. She was a kind and gentle mother, always eager to help.' Her husband Yury, who has since moved in with a new partner, said: 'I lived with her for 14 years but never suspected anything.' But there was outrage among her relatives of her elderly victims that the killer was only sentenced to 20-years in prison. One said: 'It's little more than one year for each murder. She never deserves to be freed.' The judge said he exempted her for five years of the maximum 25 years 'because she is a mother'. But her lawyer Suren Sarkisyan demanded greater leniency, and has vowed to appeal the sentence.","Alcoholic killer Irina Gaidamachuk claimed she carried out her horrific crimes to steal money for vodka .

"A mother of two sons jailed for sex attacks has been sentenced to prison herself for five years for threatening to kill a woman her husband had raped. Deborah Babic, 51, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, called the victim late at night and said she would slit her throat if the woman testified against her 53-year-old husband Milan Babic. Two months later she continued her attempts to stop her rapist husband going to jail by offering gifts to another of his eight victims, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court was told. Milan Babic was jailed last September for . life after he was convicted of 22 rapes, four attempted rapes, 13 . indecent assaults and one sexual assault, carried out over 30 years. Behind bars: Deborah Babic (left), 51, threatened to kill a woman her husband Milan Babic (right), 53, had raped . He blindfolded some of his victims and filmed the attacks and even persuaded his sons to take part in the savage rapes, the court heard. His sons Mathue, 23, and Mikorlee, 17, were also jailed, for eight and three years respectively. Mathue was found guilty of two counts of rape and one of attempted rape while his brother Mikorlee was sent to a young offenders institution after he was convicted of one count of rape. On Monday their mother Deborah Babic was also sent to jail after she was found guilty of witness intimidation and perverting the course of justice. Rapists: Their sons Mathue (left), 23, and Mikorlee (right), 17, were jailed, for eight and three years respectively .

"Cruelty: John Ward, 19, has been jailed for eight and a half years after admitting scalding a five-month-old baby's face in a boiling hot bath . A drug addict who left a five-month-old baby girl with horrendous facial injuries after dipping her face in boiling hot bath water following a weekend binge was jailed today for eight-and-a-half years. Jobless John Ward, 19, was supposed to be looking after the girl but had instead spent two days downing 30 ecstasy pills, 20 valium, amphetamines, cannabis and booze. He had also bitten the girl and she suffered two unexplained broken legs. Jailing Ward, judge Jeremy . Richardson, QC, said: 'The cruelty inflicted here almost defies belief. It was not an accident it was deliberate cruelty in the midst of an . alcohol and drug induced state. 'You . have low intelligence, but you knew what you were doing. What you did . was truly wicked. You should never have responsibility for a child . again.' Hull Crown Court heard how the baby screamed uncontrollably so Ward . rubbed the child’s face with a flannel and skin began to fall off during the incident in April last year. He woke his girlfriend Kelly Horner, 23, . who had also been drinking and smoking cannabis, to tell her the . baby was injured. Despite the seriousness of the situation they did not seek any medical attention for five hours. When the pair finally arrived at Hull Royal Infirmary they lied to doctors saying it was the result of spilt tea. Ward later told police: 'I chucked . her in the bath with the hot and cold taps running and when I came back . she was under the hot water tap. 'I forgot about the bath as I was making a cup of tea. I was about ten minutes.' The girl suffered five per cent burns and only her lips were spared injury because she had a dummy in her mouth. Neglect: John Ward, 19, and Kelly Horner, 23, admitted child neglect at Hull Crown Court after the five-month-old baby was left with burns injuries, a bite mark and two broken legs . Guilty: Kelly Horner, 23, has also admitted child neglect after failing to get medical help for the baby for five hours . Ward later admitted in interview he previously put the child in a bath when he was 'stoned' and forgotten about it. He returned to find the baby had gone blue. He admitted then he had not sought medical attention at the time. Defending, Nigel Clive, . said Ward was a foster child who had mental health problems which meant . he could become a paranoid schizophrenic. 'He . is a young man who does not bear the maturity and understanding of . someone his age. He has difficulty working out what is safe or not safe, . real or not real, what is good or what is bad.' Mr Clive said he was gullible to be taken in as a babysitter and events were clouded by the amounts of drugs he had taken. Defending John Thackray said Horner's role was merely not taking the . child to hospital for the five hours after the burns. Warning: Ward and Horner have been told to expect lengthy prison sentences after pleading guilty to child neglect . He said she . denied taking the drugs, but refused when challenged by the judge to . give evidence from the witness box. Mr . Thackray said the probation service had wrongly assumed she was guilty . of more than cruelty and made assumptions that she lacked remorse. Horner, of Cherry Tree Lane, Beverley, . pleaded guilty to child cruelty and is due to be sentenced on December 14. John Ward, of . Octagon, Willerby, pleaded guilty to charges of causing actual bodily . harmed, grievous bodily harm and child cruelty. Judge Richardson added: 'The drug and alcohol fuel background to this case is truly appalling. It appears having taken a cocktail of cannabis, ecstasy, valium, amphetamines and alcohol you were in a position of responsibility for a child that was vulnerable and helpless. 'You placed the baby's face into scolding hot water. I have no doubt she was in agony. She must have struggled and yet you did nothing. 'You took no action for five hours until the skin started peeling off her face. You then began a cover- up telling doctors tea had been spilt on her. 'I have seen the pictures of the girl taken an hour and a half after she was admitted to hospital. The suffering from the burns leaps from the page. 'She is so young she is not capable of explaining her suffering which is inculpable. In many respects the sentence should be longer.'","John Ward, 19, from Willerby, Yorkshire, left the girl with five per cent burns .

"An ancient plant believed to have last flowered outside in the UK when dinosaurs walked the earth has bloomed again - and it's down to global warming. The Cycad first appeared on Earth in the pre-Jurassic period more than 190 million years ago. It may have flowered inside before as it is still kept as a popular houseplant. But botanists studying the evergreen could find no record of it blooming outside - but in half a century it could be a common occurrence. They say they have achieved the impossible thanks to climate change. Out of the ordinary: It was possible for the plant to mature because winters have been getting milder. 'It's not like the Victorian times when the Thames would freeze over,' said curator Chris Kidd . Remarkable: A visitor at Ventnor Botanic Gardens eyes the ancient Cycad plant. It is not thought to have flowered outdoors in the UK since pre-Jurassic times . Climate change: Botanists think the plant's blooming could be down to global warming. In 50 years the event could be commonplace . Experts at Ventnor Botanic Garden, on the Isle of Wight, have been growing nine Cycad plants, also known as Cycas Revoluta, for a decade. They were stunned when a 20cm flower, which looks like a pine cone, appeared among the foliage at the beginning of this month. It comes ten years after a fossilized version of the plant was found in rocks close by in Ventnor. Curator Chris Kidd dubbed the development a 'landmark'. He said: 'We put these plants outside to see how they they would grow as part of an experiment. 'In the last ten years they've gone through one of the coldest winters for 30 years and survived. 'They've continued to produce a new flourish of leaves once a year. 'But this year one has produced a flower, which is incredibly rare. It's hard enough to grow them inside, let alone outside. 'This is probably the first time it has happened outdoors since the pre-Jurassic period. 'We weren’t expecting it at all, when they produced leaves we didn't expect any to go on to the next stage and flower. 'It means the conditions are perfect for them and it's due to climate change. 'It's a real milestone for us.' Amazed: The botanists could not believe their eyes when the plant produced the flower. It looks like a 20cm cone. They admitted it was hard enough to grow one indoors . Chris believes if the climate continues warming, the plant could become a common feature in gardens. He added: 'This isn't the type of plant that would have grown outdoors 25 years ago. 'But it's possible now because we are getting milder winters - it's not like the Victorian times when the Thames would freeze over. 'The Cycad likes heat and the micro-climate here on the Isle of Wight is quite different to the rest of the UK - we're several degrees warmer. 'We planted it on a south-facing plot where it was sheltered and got the most heat and sunlight. He added: 'It's a real landmark. In 50 years time we could see this plant flowering in gardens all over the UK.'","Ancient Cycad not bloomed outdoors for millions of years, botanists say .

"It was an unexpectedly human gesture, more often used by racetrack touts and X Factor contestants than newly appointed pontiffs. Yesterday, at a conference for the world’s media, Pope Francis gave  a double thumbs-up to the audience confirming, in no uncertain terms, that this is going to be a very different style of papacy. We already know Francis has a refreshing disdain for the trappings of office – preferring the bus to the papal limousine and rejecting the red kangaroo-leather shoes which were specially handmade for his predecessor Benedict XVI (also a fan of Gucci glasses) in favour of a pair of scuffed black lace-ups. Man of the people: The then Cardinal visits a village in Argentina in 2000 . Yesterday, in a 15-minute speech, the . former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires underlined this . unassuming approach, setting out his plans for a ‘church for the poor’. At the same time, he proved he could . work even the toughest of crowds by instantly charming 4,000 journalists . who had gathered at the Aula Paolo VI centre in the Vatican. The hall was filled with reporters . from around the globe – as well as children and babies in buggies after . he told them to bring their families. Francis was gracious, addressing the . hacks as ‘dear friends’ and thanking them for their work covering the . conclave that led to his election as the first non-European, first Latin . American pontiff. ‘You worked hard, eh,’ he joked. ‘You worked hard.’ Pope Francis gave a thumbs-up to the audience confirming that this is going to be a different style of papacy . Pope Francis revealed to journalists his hopes for the church, and how he came to select his name . Despite losing the larger part of one . lung due to a teenage infection, his voice was strong while he seemed . younger than his 76 years. Often departing from his script, . typed on a couple of A4 sheets, Francis folded it up at one point so he . could talk more freely. He showed a surprising sense of humour and has . an almost mischievous giggle. Recalling the moment when the . cardinals were counting the votes of the secret ballot, Francis said he . was sitting next to Cardinal Claudio Hummes, Archbishop Emeritus of Sao . Paulo, Brazil, ‘when the matter became dangerous’ – in that it was . becoming clear he could win. When he won the two-thirds majority . needed, Francis – the first Pope to be elected from the Jesuits – said . Hummes ‘embraced me and kissed me and said, “Don’t forget the poor.” Pope Francis I sits in the Paul VI general audience hall during an audience for members of the media . The pope thanked the media and told them how he had come to choose his name, saying he wanted Francis of Assisi who represented 'poverty and peace' Pope Francis I greeted a blind journalist and his guide dog, and warmly greeted those who had come to hear him speak . ‘And that word went in here,’ Francis . said, pointing to his head and confirming that Francis of Assisi had . been the inspiration for his papal name. A humble sole... ‘That’s how in my heart came the name . Francis of Assisi... for me he is a man of poverty, a man of peace, . a man who loved and protected Creation. Right now our relations with . Creation are not going well. ‘Francis of Assisi gives us this . spirit of peace, the poor man who wanted a poor church,’ he explained. ‘How I would love a church this poor and for the poor.’ Two cardinals in red, seated either . side of him, didn’t know what to make of it all. But there were no . questions allowed, meaning we couldn’t ask him about the Falklands, . which he has declared Argentina’s. Yet there is a genuine air of . hopefulness around St Peter’s Square. One Vaticanista, as the Vatican . watchers and correspondents are called, said: ‘Francis is a breath of . fresh air. He’s said more in 15 minutes than Benedict did in eight . years. Everything about this guy is different – it’s like a whole new . world. He’s the real deal.’ The new Pope concluded by offering his apostolic blessing... in silence. He then received a select group of . correspondents. In true Pope Francis-style, the line-up included the . receptionist from the Vatican press office. The final correspondent was a blind . man with a guide dog. The Pope bent down and patted his head before . exiting to a standing ovation. There was no encore. Although such was . the jokey nature, I half-expected Michael Palin to leap out shouting: . ‘No one expects the Spanish inquisition.’ That must be left for another . time.

"It’s a question Jose Mourinho is asked after every match: ‘Can your side match Arsenal’s invincibles?’ He doesn’t want to. That would mean drawing a further 10 Premier League matches and getting knocked out of the Champions League quarter-finals. Arsenal’s 2003-04 side is legendary. Undoubtedly Arsene Wenger’s greatest achievement, one of the most fondly-remembered teams in history won the title in emphatic fashion without losing a game. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Chelsea have made a stellar start this season, sitting top of the league and are unbeaten in all competitions . Blues boss Jose Mourinho has guided Chelsea to an an average of 2.64 points per game this term . It had only ever been achieved before once – by Preston North End in 1888-89. Quite rightly, Wenger’s team were hailed from all corners, christened ‘the Invincibles’ and became the benchmark against which all great sides in the future were judged. Now, 11 years on, Wenger and Arsenal are one of a host of big sides with a season on the verge of crumbling, huge questions being asked of the manager, the players and the club’s hierarchy. The only question being asked of runaway league leaders Chelsea, it seems, is whether they can match Thierry Henry and Co’s incredible feat. Arsenal are the only team in Premier League history to go unbeaten to date on their way to the 2003-04 title . But will it matter to Mourinho? While he’s always been a fan of getting one over Wenger – either on the pitch or in the press room – matching that Arsenal side’s points total would mean a huge downturn in form at this point. The unspoken fact on the Gunners’ incredible season is they drew 12 games, winning 26. Only one title winner has won fewer games since then – Manchester United with 23 in 2011. Arsenal could have lost seven and won just four of those 12 matches and finished on a higher points total. Their eventual tally of 90 would not have been enough to win the title in the next two seasons. Chelsea currently have 29 points from 11 games – an average of 2.64 points per game. Keeping this up for an entire season would see them finish on 100. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (left) and Mourinho (right) have a fractious relationship . VIDEO Chelsea ""untouchable"" - Wenger . Didier Drogba (back) scored Chelsea's goal in their 1-1 draw against Manchester United in October . (4-4-2) Thibaut Courtois; Branislav Ivanovic, Sol Campbell, John Terry, Ashley Cole; Robert Pires, Cesc Fabregas, Patrick Vieira, Eden Hazard; Diego Costa, Thierry Henry. Mourinho’s side have drawn two matches so far – at the homes of both Manchester clubs. With 27 games to play, having already been to Old Trafford, the Etihad, Anfield and Goodison Park, sharing points a further 10 times would hardly put a smile on Mourinho’s face. The business Chelsea did in the summer set them up for this blistering start. Mourinho identified key weaknesses in last season’s side and sealed moves for Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa early. Those two in particular, along with the league’s best defence and others such as Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic have formed the core of a side among the best and seemingly most consistent in Europe. Cesc Fabregas (left) and Diego Costa have proven a hit at Chelsea since joining this summer . Mourinho is also used to fighting on different fronts. While the mental strength involved in going a domestic campaign hasn’t been matched, Arsenal had already lost two Champions League matches – to Inter and Dynamo Kiev – by this point. Chelsea remain unbeaten in all competitions. The feat of being unbeaten consumed Wenger and his side – they drew five of their last 10 games against the likes of Portsmouth, Birmingham and a Spurs side that finished in 14th. That run-in was mostly without the distraction of Champions League football. Having been drawn in the quarter-finals against a newly-rich Chelsea side under Claudio Ranieri, Arsenal faltered and were beaten at home in the second leg thanks to a Wayne Bridge goal. Wayne Bridge's (right) goal dumped Arsenal out of the Champions League quarter-finals in the 2003-04 season . The Blues’ side, lopsided as it may have been and under an inferior manager, showed greater steel to clinch the tie over two legs. The competition that year was there for the taking. The semi-finalists were the inconsistent Chelsea, Monaco, Deportivo La Coruna and a Porto side managed by a certain Jose Mourinho. While it seemed Mourinho was destined for that particular honour and Ranieri’s tinkering put paid to Chelsea’s hopes, Arsenal’s team was far more talented than any of those semi-finalists. Mourinho has been in the Champions League semi-final for the last five years. A quarter-final exit with the talent he has at his disposal this time around would represent failure. Arsenal’s legendary team reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cup competitions is to be commended, although they fell in the League Cup against Middlesbrough. Chelsea were knocked out at the semi-finals stage of the Champions League last term to Atletico Madrid . When Mourinho insists his side won’t go unbeaten in the league, he could well be right. He will be demanding to be challenging in all competitions until the send of the season, and difficult matches in quick succession against teams fighting for their lives breeds occasional slip-ups. He will be livid, though, to draw another 10 Premier League matches and exit the Champions League at the quarter-finals. That Arsenal side deserve their gold Premier League trophy, and their place in the pantheon of great teams. But it will be no black mark over this Chelsea team if they don’t go unbeaten. They could very easily have an even better season. Blues captain John Terry will be hoping to lead Chelsea to silverware this season .","Chelsea sit top of the Premier League and are unbeaten in all competitions .

"For centuries it's been thought that the ancient Egyptians built their huge pyramids by hauling heavy granite blocks up specially crafted ramps. Yet Newport engineer Peter James has branded this ‘impossible’, claiming the ramps would need to have been a quarter of a mile long or else they would have been too steep to carry the large blocks up. He believes, instead, that the Egyptians built an inner core of zigzagging ramps, using smaller, lighter blocks while the larger outer casing stones were placed on the outside using scaffolding. A Newport engineer claims the long-held theory that the Egyptians used outer ramps to construct the pyramids is 'impossible'. He believes that the Egyptians built an inner core of zigzagging stairs, using smaller, lighter blocks while the larger outer casing stones were placed on the outside using scaffolding . This means the pyramid was built up in layers and the top would have been built using scaffolding on the outside. Peter James and his company Cintec are experts in construction and have been restoring the Egyptian pyramids for the past 18 years. Mr James told the MailOnline: ‘Looking at the pyramids from a builder’s point of view, and not an archaeologist’s, it’s clear that the current theories are nonsense. ‘Just look at the numbers. Under the current theories, to lay 2 million blocks, the Egyptians would had to have laid a large block once every three minutes. For centuries archaeologies believed that the ancient Egyptians built the huge pyramids by hauling heavy granite blocks up specially crafted ramps. Under this theory, to lay 2 million blocks, the Egyptians would had to have laid a large block once every three minutes and it would have taken 100,000 people. Newport engineer Peter James has branded this ‘impossible’ claiming the ramps would need to have been a quarter of a mile long or else they would have been too steep to carry the large blocks up. He believes, instead, that the Egyptians built an inner core of zigzagging ramps, using smaller, lighter blocks while the larger outer casing stones were placed on the outside using scaffolding. They would have set out the four corners a pyramid, like the four corners of a house. They then would have built four access points in the centre of the pyramid. Next they would have established where the burial chamber would need to be built, and that would have been built using granite. Starting from the walls of the burial chamber, the Egyptians could then build ramps using the lighter, smaller rocks in zigzags (pictured above left) around the structure, placing these rocks on top of each other as they went in order to build the pyramid up in layers. The heavy blocks could then be either pulled up these ramps on sledges, or placed on the outside using scaffolding made from timber and lashings. This theory builds on the work of French architect Jean-Pierre Houdin who, in 2007, similarly claimed that the pyramids were built from the inside out. He suggested the ramps would have been built in the centre of the pyramid, or in a spiral 30 to 50ft beneath the outer skin (pictured centre and right). The scaffolding used by the Egyptians would have been made from timber and lashings and James knows this would have been successful because he used these materials when repairing the pyramids. ‘It would have been impossible to build the pyramids using ramps around the outside, too, because they would have ended up being larger, in some cases, than the pyramids themselves. ‘Plus, what happened to the ramps once the pyramids were finished? I believe the Egyptians built the pyramids like a modern-day builder builds a house. ‘They would have set out the four corners a pyramid, like the four corners of a house. They then would have built four access points in the centre of the pyramid. ‘Next they would have established where the burial chamber would need to be built, and that would have been built using granite. ‘Starting from the walls of the burial chamber, the Egyptians could build ramps using the lighter, smaller rocks in zig-zags around the structure, placing these rocks on top of each other as they go in order to build the pyramid up in layers. As different pyramids were built, the Egyptians learnt from the construction mistakes made on previous versions to build stronger versions later on. The true pyramids, so called because they were exact pyramid shapes, would have been the culmination of trial and error, according to engineer Peter James . The theory is also supported by the maze-like inner structures of the pyramids. This is the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid of Giza . ‘Heavy blocks could then be either pulled up these ramps on sledges, or placed on the outside using scaffolding made from timber and lashings.’ James continued that once the rest of the pyramid was built, the top blocks would had to have been placed from the outside, but would fit together like ‘Lego.’ He also said that he was sure of this theory because when studying the structures he noticed that none of the blocks on the later pyramids were bigger than 30 or 40cm thick. According to Mr James, as the different pyramids were built from the Step pyramid to the Bent and Red pyramid and finally to the True pyramids, it was clear that the Egyptians were innovators. ‘Really these pyramids show a lot of innovation of how [the Egyptians] overcame problems, and how they resolved them in the next pyramid.' He was inspired by this alternative theory when he was asked to look again at the Step pyramid after the burial chamber had collapsed. ‘People believe the Egyptians built this as a stairway to the heavens and to the gods, but it’s more simple than that. On timber and lashing scaffolding, the Egyptians would not have wanted to go higher than 10 metres at a time, so they built 10 metres, took a step inwards and built another 10 metres. It’s not symbolic, it’s practical.' Whichever method was used, on these different pyramids, it would still have been a substantial job. The Great Pyramid of Giza, for example, is believed to have been 481ft tall when it was built but has sunk slightly and is now around 455ft tall. The base is said to cover 756ft. Originally, Giza, pictured, and other pyramids would have been covered by casing stones. This would have given them a smooth outer surface, yet this is missing from the current structure and all that remains is the underlying core. James believes the larger stones would have crumbled because of 4,000 years of heat exposure . Originally, Giza and other pyramids would have been covered by casing stones. This would have given it a smooth outer surface, yet this is missing from the current structure and all that remains is the underlying core. ‘Some locals claim that these stones were stolen, but I can’t see anyone wanting to climb that high to do that,’ said Peter James. ‘Archaeologists claim that the pyramid casing fell off, especially on the bent pyramid, because of the foundations. But it’s not that either. Not at all. ‘It’s a simple temperature problem. The outer blocks heat up to 40 and 50 degrees during the day and at night it cools to 4 or 5 degrees. ‘When limestone heats up, it expands and it never goes back to where it starts. This would have caused the casing and the structure to warp and bend meaning the problem was all over the pyramid, so it couldn’t be foundations. Originally, Giza and other pyramids would have been covered by casing stones. This would have given it a smooth outer surface, yet these are missing from the current structure and all that remains is the underlying core. ‘Some locals claim that these stones were stolen, but I can’t see anyone wanting to climb that high to do that,’ continued James. ‘Archaeologists claim that the pyramid casing fell off, especially on the bent pyramid, because of the foundations.

This would have caused the casing and the structure to warp and bend meaning the problem was all over the pyramid, so it couldn’t be foundations. 'And after 4,000 years, that’s a lot of expanding and movement. There’s a builder’s story to be told here. Not an academic one.’ The reason Egyptian chose the pyramid shape is believed to stem back to the Egyptian sun god Ra. Ra was said to have created himself from a pyramid-shaped mound of earth before he created all other gods. The shape is also thought to be symbolic of the sun’s rays and they were usually placed on the western side of the Nile so the pharaoh’s soul could join the sun as set. James’ theory supports that suggested by French architect Jean-Pierre Houdin in 2007. Like James, Houdin began working on the riddle and quickly found flaws in the two existing theories. He claimed the ramp must have been a spiral 30-50ft beneath the outer skin. He added that his theory could be proved by radars and heat detecting cameras as the ramp had to remain inside the finished structure. The two theories mean that that 4,000 people could have built the pyramid using the techniques outlined - rather than previous estimates of around 100,000.","For centuries it was thought the Egyptians built the pyramids using ramps .

"David Cameron and the Queen will not attend the inauguration of Pope Francis. There were suggestions that the move might be seen as a snub after Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner revealed that she had asked the pontiff to intervene in her country’s dispute with Britain over the Falkland Islands. But a Downing Street spokesman said last night that the Prime Minister’s decision to send Cabinet ministers Baroness Warsi and Kenneth Clarke to the inauguration ‘is absolutely nothing to do with the Falklands’. Scroll down for video . Neither David Cameron (left) nor the Queen (centre) will make it to the inauguration of Pope Francis I (right . The Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner and Pope Francis I have been at odds before, most notably over the issue of gay marriage . The most senior British royal to attend will be the Duke of Gloucester. Miss Kirchner became the first . foreign head of state to meet the new Pope, formerly Archbishop of . Buenos Aires, at the Vatican City yesterday. Afterwards, she said: ‘I asked for . his intervention to avoid problems that could emerge from the . militarisation of Great Britain in the south Atlantic.’ The Vatican refused to comment, saying the meeting was ‘private and informal’. Miss Kirchner’s relationship with . Jorge Mario Bergoglio before he was elected Pope was toxic, as the pair . clashed over her government’s socially liberal policies. But after they exchanged . gifts, she said: ‘I was so happy he invited me to meet him and that I . got to eat his last lunch with him before he becomes Pope. And never . before has a Pope kissed me.’ After the Pope thanked Ms Kirchner for her presents, she exclaimed 'Never in my life has a Pope kissed me' A gift from home: Ms Kirchner presented the Pope with a traditional mate gourd and straw to drink tea from . Ms Kircnher also told reporters: 'I asked for his intervention on the question of the Malvinas. 'We want a dialogue and that's why we asked the Pope to intervene so that the dialogue is successful.' Earlier this month, the islanders . voted overwhelmingly to remain a British Overseas Territory.  It is now . known how the Pope responded to Ms Kirchner, but before he was Pope he . has been quoted as saying that Britain had 'usurped' the islands from . Argentina. Ms Kirchner also presented the Pope with a mate gourd - a sort of traditional tea urn - and a straw, from . which he could drink his favourite Argentinian tea. Afterwards the Argentinian leader said the Pope had kissed her to thank her for the gift form his native country. Tomorrow world leaders will gather in . Rome to attend his installation Mass in St Peter's Square. A total of 130 delegations are due to . attend the Pope’s inaugural mass today, including one led by the . Zimbabwean despot Robert Mugabe. The feisty Argentinian premier arrived bearing gifts for the Pope, before asking for his help over the Falklands . The 76-year-old Pontiff, who was born in Buenos Aires, has previously clashed with the Argentinian premier over her socially liberal policies and with what he has called her government's 'totalitarianism'. Ms Kirchner and her predecessor and late husband, Nestor Kirchner, defied church teaching to push through sex education in schools, free contraception, and the right for transsexuals to change their official identities. In 2010 Argentina became the first Latin American country to legalise gay marriage, when the now-Pope was then Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio.  According to his biographer, he knew the church wouldn't win a fight against it, so he urged his bishops to lobby for gay civil unions instead.

US . vice president Joe Biden has also flown to Rome for tomorrow's Mass, . where he will represent the American delegation.  Today he was . photographed reviewing the guard of honour at the Palazzo Chigi with the . outgoing Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti. After today's meeting between Francis I and Ms Kirchner, the two . Argentinians had lunch together - a meal that might have been awkward, . given their long history of disagreements. But when the bishops shot down his proposal, the Cardinal declared what gay activists called a 'war of God' on the measure, and the church lost the issue altogether. The chilly relations between the pair . became apparent a few years ago when Ms Kirchner and her late husband . stopped attending the church's annual Te Deum address challenging . society to do better. Souvenir makers have been busy as more than a million visitors are expected to see the new Pope in Rome . In last year's address, Bergoglio said . Argentina was being harmed by demagoguery, totalitarianism, corruption . and efforts to secure unlimited power: a strong message to a country . whose president has ruled by decree and left scandals unpunished. More recently, a degree of silence was noted on Ms Kirchner's normally-chatty Twitter account when the Argentinian was elected Pope last week. She posted just one Tweet all day, saying 'To your Holiness Francis I' and linking to her letter of congratulations, which wasn't even signed. Vatican-watchers said the choice of venue for today's meeting was unusual, given Francis has technically taken possession of the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace, where such formal audiences are usually held. However he has conducted all of his audiences in the hotel to date, including with one with the Vatican secretary of state earlier today. Rows of chairs have been laid out ahead of tomorrow's Mass where Pope Francis I will be formally installed as leader of the Roman Catholic church . The Vatican said it planned no statement, describing the meeting as private and informal. The meeting with Ms Kirchner is just a warm-up for the new Pope, given the number of world heads descending on Rome for his installation Mass tomorrow. More than 120 official delegations will witness Francis I's formal installation as the 266th leader of the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church. Italian media say Rome civil protection authorities are expecting more than a million people to attend the Mass, numbers not seen since the beatification of Pope John Paul II in 2011 which drew 1.5 million to St. Peter's and the surrounding streets. One significant VIP is the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I. The new Pope's low-key style has been evident from the start: Here he waded into the crowd to meet people . His presence at the installation is the first from the Istanbud-based Patriarchate since the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches split in the Great Schism nearly 1,000 years ago. Also arriving in Rome today was Taiwanese President President Ma Ying-jeou, in what is a rare European foray for the head of the diplomatically isolated island that underscores the tricky nature of its relations with China and the Vatican. As he arrived in Italy he said: 'We want to have much better relations with the Vatican and I think we will.' The Taiwanese President said the new Pope was a 'wonderful person', adding: 'I think he'll do a very good job.' Taiwan has full diplomatic relations with only 23 countries, most of them in Latin America, Africa, and the south Pacific. Its only diplomatic ally in Europe is the Vatican, though even that tie remains tenuous. The Vatican has long expressed a willingness to transfer its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, though it has made that conditional on China allowing its Catholics to worship freely, without Communist Party restrictions. China has congratulated the new pope on his election, but said that establishing formal relations would depend on the Vatican cutting ties with Taipei and ceasing activities Beijing considers interference in its internal affairs. Pope Francis' informal style got the better of him when he telephoned a Vatican receptionist directly and was told: 'And I'm Napoleon.' The new pope, according to Croatian religious website Bitno.net, had announced himself when he called a Jesuit residence in Rome on Friday and got through to the switchboard. He had been trying to contact Adolfo Nicolas, the superior general of the Pope's old Jesuit order. But the baffled receptionist - identified only as Andreas - thought someone was playing a trick on him and quipped back: 'Oh yes? And I'm Napoleon.' His holiness eventually got through, after managing to convince the receptionist he was genuine saying: 'I really am Pope Francis.' One Vatican expert explained: 'You can't really blame the poor man.  No other pope would have picked up a telephone to make their own calls.  An official usually calls a secretary who places the call. 'The receptionist is extremely distraught but I think the new pope has a good sense of humour and will laugh it off,' they added.","David Cameron and the Queen won't attend the installation Mass .

"The US government has stepped up its screening process of those travelling into the country from Europe. Passengers travelling from countries in the US Visa Waiver Program will have to declare if they hold a second passport. The new rules will affect travellers from 38 so-called 'friendly' nations who have a visa waiver agreement with the US. The threat of terrorists with Western passports have made the US tighten airport security . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said: 'We are taking this step to enhance the security of the Visa Waiver Program, to learn more about travelers from countries from whom we do not require a visa,' Johnson said in a statement. The move was in response to the security threat posed by the possible radicalisation of foreign fighters in Syria who hold Western passports and thus would not arouse suspicion at airports or other entry points. Thirty-eight countries participate in the Visa Waiver Program, or VWP, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries as well as Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, according to the State Department. 'DHS is concerned about the risks posed by the situation in Syria and Iraq, where increasing instability has attracted thousands of foreign fighters, including many from VWP countries,' the DHS official said on condition of anonymity. The move was in response to the security threat posed by the possible radicalisation of foreign fighters in Syria who hold Western passports . The official cited cases in which people traveled from Syria to Europe and carried out attacks, including a museum shooting in Belgium in May, as well as public threats against the United States in response to its involvement in Iraq. Islamic State militants have released videos of the beheading of American civilians that blamed U.S. air strikes for their actions. The new screening measures have been brought in by Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson . Visitors from countries in the Visa Waiver Program must get approved through an online system called Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, and pay a fee. Under the rules that took effect Monday, people from those countries will have to provide additional information in the ESTA travel application. That includes other names used, parents' names, national identification number, contact information, employment information and city of birth, according to a US Customs and Border Protection announcement. The DHS official said the additional data will help identify threats or detect suspected terrorists. Citizens of Canada and Mexico, which share borders with the United States, do not need visas to enter the country as part of a separate program. Some members of Congress have sought to scale back or cancel the Visa Waiver Program in light of the foreign fighters threat. Democratic U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii in September called for a suspension of the program in countries that have large numbers of Islamic extremists fighting abroad. Monday's CBP announcement on the changes said the Visa Waiver Program does not make Americans more vulnerable, as participating countries must have a high degree of security cooperation with the United States. Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, said the additional requirements were 'a step in the right direction to counter this growing threat.'","Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson introduces new proposals .

"Key witness: Tango the Labrador sat in the box as his owner's murder suspect threatened him with a bat . A dog has given evidence in a French murder trial. Tango, a nine-year-old Labrador, was called to the witness stand to help determine who killed his owner. In . a preliminary hearing, the suspect was ordered by the judge to . threaten Tango with a bat, as jurors noted how the canine reacted. For comparison, a second dog of the same age and breed, Norman, was also called to the witness box in the French city of Tours to face the experiment. Gregoire Lafarge, defending, blasted the 'unreasonable' and 'dangerous' proceedings. He told RTL radio: 'So if Tango lifted his right paw, moved his mouth or his tail, is he recognising my client or not? 'I find it very troubling for the French legal system. 'If . a judge ignores the demands of reason and surrounds himself with . experts who are unreasonable, the system becomes very dangerous.' But it is hardly the first time a dog has been called to the stand. In 2008, a dog named Scooby created legal history as the first canine to appear as a witness in a murder case. The . animal's 59-year-old owner had been found hanging from the ceiling of . her Paris flat. Police believe it was suicide but her family say that it . was murder. The dog was in the flat at the time of the death. During a preliminary hearing in the city, the pet was led into the witness box by a vet. A suspect in the case was presented to the dog, to see how it reacted. It is said to have 'barked furiously'. In 2012, a court in Charlotte County, Florida, took a similar approach by sending a subpoena to a German Shepherd in a drugs case. Not the first: In 2012, a German Shepherd was served a subpoena in Charlotte County, Florida . The canine witnes was presented with suspects and drugs as vets responded to hit reaction . And last month a vet was asked to analyse a Dalmatian's physical reactions as it sat in the witness box faced with two murder suspects. Dog behaviourist Jacques Cordel has blasted the activity as 'illegitimate'. He wrote in French magazine Nouvel Observateur: 'This . expertise plays on popular beliefs, but has no scientific foundation.

"When the ballots closed he was in for a nervous wait. But when state media called the result, incredibly, the votes had gone Kim Jong Un's way. In the true style of a despot, North Korea's supreme leader won his first election - with an almost impossible to believe 100 per cent approval. After all, in a secretive one-party state like North Korea, there was only ever going to be Un winner. Scroll down for video .

North Koreans went to the polls on . Sunday to approve the new roster of deputies for the Supreme People's . Assembly, the country's legislature. The vote, more a political ritual than an election by Western standards, is generally held once every five years to rubber-stamp the assembly. Though results for the other seats in the assembly had not yet been announced, North Korea's media quickly reported Kim had won in his district - located on the symbolic Mount Paekdu - without a single dissenting ballot. In the previous elections, 687 deputies were chosen. This is first time the election had been held since Kim inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. 'This is an expression of all the service personnel and people's absolute support and profound trust in supreme leader Kim Jong Un as they single-mindedly remain loyal to him,' the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

Voters in the election have no choice who to vote for - there is only one candidate's name on the ballot for each of the 687 districts. Instead, they have the choice of voting yes or no, and according to official accounts virtually all choose yes. North Korea also typically puts turnout nationwide at over 99 per cent. Mobile ballot boxes were created to . cater to those who were ill and could not travel to balloting stations, state media reported. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un speaks to Choe Ryong-hae (left), director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army . A number of poems were also produced to . celebrate voting under titles including 'The Billows of Emotion and . Happiness' and 'We Go To Polling Station'. Analysts will be closely watching to see if the deputies this time around reflect a generational change as Kim looks to solidify his power and replace older cadres with younger, more loyal ones. The Supreme People's Assembly usually meets only rarely, often only once a year. In practice it has little power and when it is not in session, its work is done by a smaller and more powerful body called the Presidium. The new parliament was expected to meet next month. No date has been officially announced. The election comes after North Korea's second-most powerful man reappeared on TV, contradicting reports that he may have been purged from the isolated nation's leadership. Choe Ryong Hae was seen close to the country's leader Kim Jong-un in pictures taken in the past couple of months, smiling but sporting a limp. His reappearance in public refutes recent speculation that he had been purged by Kim, whose shake up of North Korea's elite included the execution of his uncle last year.","Kim Jong Un won every ballot cast by voters in his district .

"Talent: Vanessa Mae has sold more than 10million records and was the youngest soloist ever to record the demanding Beethoven and Tchaikovsky violin concertos when she was 13 . As if being an internationally renowned violinist wasn’t enough, Vanessa Mae has added another string to her bow. The 35-year-old British star has been selected to ski in the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia next month. Miss Mae is putting her musical career on ice for a year to compete for Thailand, where her father was born.

"Ukraine's secret unit of spy dolphins and seals have defected to Russia and are now swimming under Kremlin orders, officials revealed today. The Army has been using the underwater mammals since the 70s, and they remained under Ukrainian command after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The bottlenose dolphins are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. Scroll down for video . Defecting: The Ukrainian army's dolphins, trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs and attack enemy divers, will be transferred to the Russian Navy . Loyal: The army has been using the underwater mammals since the 70s, and they remained under Ukrainian command after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The use of bottlenose dolphins as naval assets was begun during the Cold War in Sevastopol by the Soviet Union in 1973. With the collapse of the USSR, they were enlisted in the Ukrainian navy. Now after the Russian repossession of the Crimean peninsula this month, it was revealed today that the combat dolphins are now back under Kremlin control along with all 193 military units in the region. ‘The military dolphins serving in Crimea will be transferred to the Russian Navy,’ reported state-owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti. In fact, Ukraine announced last month it was preparing to cease naval training with the mammals, so the Russian annexation of the Black Sea region has probably saved the unique underwater force. ‘Engineers are developing new equipment for new programmes so that the dolphins can be used more effectively in underwater operations,’ a source said today. In action: One of the 'spy dolphins' is being moved from a pool into the sea, pictured in 1990, before the fall of the USSR . How to: A dolphin model is wearing some of the specially designed kit in a military museum . Search and rescue: Dolphins were sent out on bomb missions where the army did not want to risk the life of a diver . Part of the team: A military dolphin with two divers in this undated Russian military photo . ‘Our specialists have been working on new equipment that transform the dolphin's sonar signal at the point of detecting a submarine into a signal on the operator's screen. ‘But the Ukrainian Fleet didn't have enough money to develop such know how and some projects had to be closed.’ The dolphin specialists believe the Russian military will fund the new developments. While the dolphins show extraordinary intelligence, sometimes they disobeyed their Ukrainian commanders. Last year three of  five spy dolphins went absent without leave in the Black Sea - apparently in search of love, but returned to their duties shortly afterwards. Yury Plyachenko, a former Soviet naval anti-sabotage officer, explained that this was something that had to be taken into account in working with the 007 mammals. ‘If a male dolphin saw a female dolphin during the mating season, then he would immediately set off after her. But they come back in a week or so.’","The Ukraine Army has been using dolphins and seals since the 70s .

"A World War II fighter pilot who gained fame for dramatically flying beneath the Eiffel Tower's arches to take down a German aircraft has died aged 92. William Overstreet Jr. died on Sunday at a hospital in Roanoke, Virginia, according to his obituary, but there was no indication of the cause of his death. Overstreet's famously flew his P-51C 'Berlin Express' beneath the Eiffel Tower in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1944, which has been credited with lifting the spirits of French Resistance troops on the ground. For his valiant service, the French ambassador to the United States presented Overstreet with France's Legion of Honor at the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford in 2009. Hero: World War II Aviator Bill Overstreet Jr., best known for flying beneath the Eiffel Tower in pursuit of a German plane, is pictured in his military days. He passed away in Virginia on Sunday, aged 92 . Before the ceremony, Overstreet had previously said that, if he lived long enough to receive the Legion of Honor, he would be accepting it in memory of his fallen brothers. In particular, he wanted to pay tribute to a friend, Eddy Simpson, who died fighting the Nazis on the ground so his comrades, including Overstreet, could escape. After the award was pinned to his lapel, Overstreet said: 'If I said, ""Thank you,"" it wouldn’t be enough,' before adding: 'What more than ""thank you"" do you need?' Overstreet was also awarded hundreds of other medals for his service in the 357th squadron of the U.S. Army Air Forces, his obituary said. He was born in Clifton Forge, Virginia in 1921 and after Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the Air Corps as a fighter pilot. By February 1942, he was a private and sent to California for flight training; here, his instructors prepared him for the unexpected mid-flight by cutting the engine as he landed. Remembered: Overstreet was presented with France's Legion of Honour in 2009 . Action: An artist's depiction of the dramatic moment shows Overstreet in his P51 Mustang chasing an ME 109 under the Eiffel Tower in Spring 1944. He was able to shoot the plane down . Overstreet credited this extreme training method with preparing him for the unexpected in war, Warbirds News reported. During training in 1943, he suffered a near-death crash when his plane, a Bell P-39 Airacobra, began spinning as he practiced maneuvers, and he was unable to control it. He eventually forced his way out through the doors and found himself standing amid the wreckage. When he flew in World War II, he suffered another freak accident when his oxygen line cut out as he flew 25,000 feet over France. He passed out but snapped awake and controlled the plane and dodged trees in front of him to figure out where he was and land safely. Newspapers at the time reported that he could not remember a whole 90 minutes of the flight. In the spring of 1944, he was following a German aircraft over Paris, with the two planes firing at each other. Overstreet eventually hit the other pilot's engine. Aircraft: Overstreet is pictured by his P-51 'Berlin Express', the plane he flew beneath the Eiffel Tower . Proud: Overstreet is pictured in 1943 with his cherished 1938 Buick in California, where he trained . Close call: The wreckage of his Bell P-39 Airacobra which spun out of control mid-air as he completed combat training in 1943. He managed to force his way out of the craft and walked away unhurt . As the German pilot desperately sought to out-maneuver Overstreet, he flew beneath the Eiffel Tower - but the brave American flew directly beneath it and continued to fire. The German plane crashed and Overstreet was able to escape the city. The astounding show of skill and bravery lifted the spirits of the French, french dignitary, Bernard Marie, told the Roanoke Times. He said he only fully understood the importance of Overstreet's feat when he spoke with his father about it. 'My father began shouting out me - ""I have to meet this man"",' Marie said. 'This guy has done even more than what people are thinking. He lifted the spirit of the French.' After flying further missions, including a top secret escort mission, his tour of duty ended in October 1944 and he returned to the U.S. Loss: Bill Overstreet is pictured at an event, Warbirds Over the Beach, in 2013. After finishing his service, he returned to the U.S. and became an accountant - but he continued to attend veterans events . He went on to teach at a gunnery school in Pinellas, Florida and when he was released from active duty, he remained on the Reserves. He went on to work as General Manager of Charleston Aviation in West Virginia before moving to Roanoke in 1950, where he worked as an accountant until he was 65. Before his death, he also worked with numerous charities and veterans groups, appearing at air shows and gatherings with fellow veterans. He was preceded in death by his wife, Nita. Anne Mason Keller, Overstreet's niece, said of her uncle: 'He was a fighter, he was always a perfect gentleman. He was concise, focused with a delightful sense of humor and a twinkle in his eyes. 'He was always humble. Whenever the press interviewed him, he said, ""I didn't do anything, we were a team"".' His family has asked that those attending his memorial service on Saturday those wear something either or both red and yellow, his squadron's colors.","William Overstreet Jr., a former captain in the U.S. Air Corps, passed away on Sunday at a hospital in Roanoke .

"Cuba has announced that it will ease restrictions on car imports for the first time in half a century, marking the end of an era that made icons of the island's vintage automobiles. The official newspaper Granma said the decision to allow cars to be imported for sale at market prices on the island was taken Wednesday by Cuba's council of ministers. It said the decision will gradually free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles- automobiles, vans, trucks and motorcycles- and end the practice of granting some Cubans special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege. More cars on the road: Cuban streets have seen very few new cars over the past 50 years because of the embargo against foreign importers . New era: The decision will gradually free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles and end the practice of granting some Cubans special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege . Hanging out: A group of Cubans remain atop a classic US car in Havana, watching one of the first automobile competitions with the support of Cuban sports organizations . New leaf: The government of Cuba agreed to make more flexible the retail sales of new and used vehicles in the island allowing Cubans to buy cars from government retailers without permissions . Granma acknowledged the so-called . ‘letters of authorization’ issued by the transport ministry had . generated ‘resentment, dissatisfaction and, in not a few cases ... (were) a source of speculation and enrichment.’ Holders of the letters, however, will still be first in line to buy cars while the new system is phased in, Granma said. Opening . Cuba's domestic car market to imports is likely to have fateful . consequences for the lovingly maintained 1950s Chevys, Fords and . Pontiacs that have survived a 50-year-old US embargo. No . official figures are available on Cuba's automobile fleet, but experts . believe there are around 60,000 American cars still circulating on the . island.

Cuba was the leading importer of North American manufactured cars by the early 1950s. By 1955, the island nation was home to 125,000 Detroit-made cars. Cubans were enamored with the so-called Chariots of Chrome, so much so that the '57 Chevy's debut in Havana--which, astonishingly, came before the car's U.S. premier--attracted a crowd of 40,000. But in 1959, Castro and his revolutionaries seized power in Cuba and immediately set about changing the nation's relationship with America. Castro's regime sought greater communalism and nationalism. His country's love affair with the American car, a symbol of both capitalist success and excess, had to go. ‘The Cadillac does not provide jobs for anyone,’ Castro said shortly after seizing power. ‘The Cadillac does not increase the wealth of the country. It diminishes it.’ The dictator halted all imports of American-made cars. Only those who owned cars in or before 1959 were granted ful private ownership of the automobile. For everyone else, that right was revoked from then on. From that day on, for the next half century, Cubans would be forced out of both a necessity and a deep sense of nostalgia to meticulously maintain their vehicles. Over 50 years later, in November 2011, the restrictions on the sale of one's personal car would finally be lifted in Cuba. The antique Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and Buicks could suddenly change hands. And on December 13, 2013, Cuban officials voted to allow the sale of imported cars on the island for the first time since the revolution. One more step: This is the latest sign of liberalization on the part of the Communist regime led by Raul Castro (seen shaking President Obama's had during Nelson Mandela's memorial service) The changes are a long-awaited element of President Raul Castro's attempts to gradually liberalize Cuba's Soviet-style economy. The government in September 2011 allowed Cubans and foreigners living on the island to sell their used cars to one another. ‘We've been waiting for this for 20 years,’ said a 54-year-old professional in Old Havana, who would not give his name. Freddy Mugercia, a 41-year-old taxi driver, also welcomed the news. ‘Now anyone who has money will be able to buy a car. There were a lot of people who had received money from their families (outside Cuba) and weren't able to,’ he said. Granma provided few specifics on how the broader car market will work, saying the new rules would be made public in the coming days. Market flood to come: Because of the restricted supply, car prices in Cuba are already astronomical and the cars that were imported from before the embargo are kept in mint condition . Rainy days: A man rides his tricycle taxi beside a car held up on concrete blocks, one of many vintage American automobiles that lasted well past their glory days ni the Caribbean nation . A man cycles beside a U.S.-made car used as a private collective taxi, parked beside a mural of the Cuban national flag, in Havana. Collective taxis, also known as almendron, have established routes around or near Havana, picking up and dropping off passengers along the way . Cheap ride: The price of a journey in these taxis ranges from $0.50 for a ride within the city to $1 for a 30km lift . But it said pricing of new vehicles should be similar to that for used vehicles sold privately. That suggests the government will impose hefty taxes on sales of imported vehicles. Because of the restricted supply, car prices in Cuba are already astronomical. A basic Lada in good condition, for example, sells for around $12,000, about as much as a '57 Ford that has gotten decades of use as a taxi. A Cadillac convertible, like those that cruise the Havana waterfront with tourists aboard, can cost up to $80,000. For most Cubans, with salaries that average just $20 a month, owning a car is still just a dream. In the meantime, Granma said, proceeds from car sales are to go to finance upgrades to Cuba's public transportation system. An old Pontiac sits regally in a Havana parking lot. Some estimate as many as 60,000 vintage cars populate Cuba. Others place the number as high as 200,000, the bulk of which are American made .

"The final of the Invitational Darts Tournament in Melbourne was halted for after a riot broke out among members of the crowd. The match which saw Michael van Gerwen comeback from 5-1 and 8-4 deficits before eventually triumphing over Australian Simon Whitlock 9-8, was stopped for a period of time as officials attempted to restore some order about the Etihad Stadium. Chairs were thrown and tables were overturned as spectators ran amok at the tournament which is in its third year. People were understood to be jumping on the tables until they broke in half and some were body slamming other crowd members.

"The main attractions at most zoos are lions, tigers and other endangered animals. Not so in North Korea. State media revealed today the Central Zoo in Pyongyang has unveiled its latest draw - a pack of Yorkshire Terriers. Korea Central News Agency said the miniature dogs have been introduced and are learning 'several feats' to perform for visitors. Scroll down for video . (File picture) Three Yorkshire terriers have been unveiled at Pyongyang Central Zoo, according to North Korea's state media . In a statement on agency's website, it said: 'Recently, Yorkshire terriers were sent to the Central Zoo in the DPRK. 'Each one has long hair tan on its head and legs and blue grey on its body. It is 22-24cm tall and weighs 2.5-3.5kg. 'It lives about 14 years on an average. Now they are learning several feats in the zoo.' Most North Koreans will be unfamiliar with 'Yorkies'. The dogs were originally bred in Yorkshire to catch rats and mice by scuttling around clothing mills. A picture released by KCNA appeared to show three Yorkshire Terriers in seemingly good condition. North Korea's Pyongyang Central Zoo is located in suburban . Pyongyang and has a large collection of more than 5,000 animals. It was . built in 1959 under the orders of dictator Kim Il-Sung. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un inspecting the aquatic products refrigerating facilities newly built by the Korean People's Army . However, like the rest of country ruled by Kim Jong-Un it is believed to be a grim place to live. In a 2006 report by the Asia Times described a movie shot in the country called 'Fighting Animals', which purported to be a wildlife documentary but actually showed caged animals - even some endangered species - fighting to the death. Since many of the animals in the video can only be found in the Pyongyang Zoo, it seems likely zookeepers were involved in the film's production. Central Zoo has also been condemned by travel publication Lonely Planet, whose website claims most of the animals kept there 'look pretty forlorn'. It said: 'Worst off are the big cats, nearly all gifts of long-dead communist big wigs around the world - the wonderful lions, tigers and leopards are kept in woefully inadequate compounds, and many have lost the plot as a result.' 'The zoo's two elephants and its hippo all look exceptionally lacklustre as well.' In December 2012 footage was uploaded to YouTube by documentary maker Alun Hill appeared to show bears and elephants trudging around largely concrete enclosures, and tigers staring at visitors from behind bars. According to the video, the zoo houses 650 different species in 60 animal shed and aquariums.","State media said Central Zoo in Pyongyang has a new draw .

"Ever wondered who would rush to Santa’s aid if he had to crash-land his sleigh? Or perhaps you’ve pondered your local council’s state of readiness for a zombie invasion? If not, don’t worry. Someone, somewhere is asking these crucial questions. Ridiculous request: Cheltenham Council was asked to reveal who would be responsible for rescuing Santa if he crash-landed during his rounds . They were two of the more bizarre queries put to local authorities under Freedom of Information laws this year. Others centred on what measures might be being put in place to defend against Napoleon’s army, how many drawing pins a town hall uses and how much taxpayers’ money was paid to exorcists. The Local Government  Association unveiled its top ten list of bizarre FOI questions of 2011 to highlight the huge cost to taxpayers of frivolous requests. At the top was this request to West Devon Council: How does the council plan to help the brave soldiers of our infantry if and when Napoleon and his marauding hordes invade the district? The French emperor died in 1821, six years after his defeat at Waterloo. Zombie nation: Both Bristol and Leicester councils were asked what they would do in the event of an invasion by the undead . Cheltenham Council was asked to provide details of its contingency plans for a crash landing by Santa. The applicant called for details about who at the council would rescue Santa, who would be responsible for rounding up the reindeer and which staff would get the job of clearing the crash site. Both Bristol Council and Leicester Council were quizzed about their readiness for a zombie invasion, while Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service was asked about plans for an alien attack. The Freedom of Information Act gives people the right to ask any public body for information they have on any subject they choose. Unless there’s a good reason, the organisation must provide the information within 20 working days. Nonsense: Another wasteful question probed one council on how they would counter an attack by the long-deceased Napoleon and his 19th century army . Peter Fleming, chairman of the LGA’s improvement board, said: ‘Across the country, hundreds of Freedom of Information requests are sent to local authorities every day. ‘However, as this list shows, some of the requests do not appear to relate very closely to the services councils are focused on delivering.’ More than 197,000 requests for information were made to councils this year. The local authorities spent £31.6million responding. Hampshire Council was asked how many drawing pins there were in its town hall, and what percentage were stuck in a pin board. Overly superstitious: One local authority was quizzed on how much it paid to exorcists (posed by actors) Scarborough Council was asked how many cheques were issued by the council and how many it received. The number of privacy walls between toilets was the hot topic for a Cornwall Council taxpayer. A request to Wealden Council asked: How does the council manage to cope with the vagaries of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle? For the uninitiated, the quantum mechanics principle deals with the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the momentum and position of a sub-atomic particle.",Released to expose cost of dealing with frivolous requests under Freedom of Information Act .

"It was a moment on Instagram on Monday that really set tongues wagging about the prospect of Lionel Messi moving to Chelsea. As the Barcelona superstar clicked follow on Chelsea and Cesc Fabregas, the chatter about a possible move from the Nou Camp to Stamford Bridge on social media understandably grew louder. And amidst the turmoil at Barcelona with the dismissal of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and the reported fall-out between Messi and head coach Luis Enrique, all of a sudden the prospect of the Argentinian wearing a Chelsea shirt did not seem so unrealistic. The fact that Messi had just started following former Barcelona team-mate Fabregas on Instagram was a slight surprise as the two have been good friends for a while, with their respective partners Antonella Roccuzzo and Daniella Semaan also enjoying a close friendship. Lionel Messi (third left) and Cesc Fabregas (third right) hang out at the Blue Marlin Beach Club in Ibiza in 2013 .

Messi (left) celebrates with Fabregas after scoring for Barcelona against Almerica in September 2013 . Messi fuelled speculation he could be keen on a move to Chelsea by following the club's Instagram account . Ahead of Fabregas's switch from Barcelona to Chelsea last summer, Semaan sent an Instagram message to her friend, saying 'I miss this girl so so so so much' before using the hashtag #tevoyaextranar, translated as 'I'll miss you'. And the relationship between Semaan and Roccuzzo may well be a crucial factor if Messi was to consider joining Chelsea. Semaan and Roccuzzo have been spotted together in London in recent months, enjoying shopping trips in Knightsbridge and in November they were joined by Fabregas for a lunch at a London restaurant. A quick look through their Instagram pages shows just how close they are and Roccuzzo would surely find the prospect of living in London along with her best friend appealing.

Messi scores from the penalty spot during the Copa del Rey last 16 match against Elche . If Messi was to make a move to London, the fact he has close friends here would help him settle after living in Barcelona since 2000. Fabregas publicly, though, has been careful to play down suggestions that he could be involved in a potential Messi move but did acknowledge that he would love to play alongside his mate again. The Chelsea midfielder told Spanish radio program Al Primer Toque on Onda Cero: 'I'm upset that they say that I could be mediating for Messi to come to Chelsea. How can I be talking about contracts... I'm only a footballer. 'He (Messi) will do what makes him happiest. Personally, as his friend, colleague and footballer, if you gave me the chance to play with him again, I would welcome it.' Manchester United and Real Madrid are the only two clubs that could sign Lionel Messi for an outright fee within Financial Fair Play rules, according to a football finance expert. And considering that the prospect of Messi moving from Barcelona to their arch rivals is unlikely, then the Old Trafford club may be the only realistic destination for the Argentinian if he was to leave the Nou Camp. Even then, meeting the 27-year-old's wages without breaking UEFA's FFP rules could prove a struggle. An offer of £196million would meet Messi's buy-out clause and oblige Barcelona to sell if it was the player's will to leave. Rob Wilson, a football finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, told the BBC: 'With the revenue they generate and cash reserves, only United and Real Madrid could pay the fee. 'With salary costs probably even they couldn't stay within FFP.' If a club exceeds losses of more than £23.5m over a three-year period that includes the current campaign, they open themselves to the prospect of sanctions by UEFA. A staggered transfer payment could avoid any breach of rules but it is believed that Barcelona would be unlikely to accept this. Wilson said: 'Unless Messi absolutely wanted to get out of the club, why would Barcelona agree to that? 'Staggering the payments would certainly make it easier for Chelsea, Manchester City, PSG and Bayern Munich but Manchester United demanded the fee up front when they sold Cristiano Ronaldo and I strongly suspect it would be the same for Messi.'","There has been mounting speculation that Lionel Messi could join Chelsea .

"Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the assault rifle that has killed more people than any other firearm in the world, has died in hospital at the age of 94. The creator of the AK-47 more than 60 years ago died in hospital his home city of Izhevsk, near the Ural Mountains - where his gun is still made. He had been ill for some time and had been in intensive care since November 17. Scroll down for video .

Right, at his home near the town where it is still made . Honoured: He met President Vladimir Putin just three months ago. Mr Putin expressed his 'deep condolences' Kalashnikov, a Russian peasant with little formal education, designed the eponymous rifle in 1947  - with the letters AK-47 referring to 'Kalashnikov's Automatic' (Avtomat Kalashnikova) and the year of its release. But the rifle and its variants soon became the weapons of choice for . dozens of armies and guerrilla groups around the world. Specifically engineered to work in the harsh conditions in which Soviet troops operated, it became one of the most successful weapons ever produced and turned its inventor into one of the most lauded men in the Soviet Union. Cheap, efficient and easily mass-produced, the gun soon became synonymous with killing on a sometimes indiscriminate scale. It was taken up by militants as far afield as Iraq, Afghanistan, Colombia, Liberia, Sudan, Zaire and Gaza, to name a few. Osama Bin Laden was infamously pictured clutching the deadly weapon.

Mass-produced: A Nato soldier surrounded by weapons collected from Albanian guerillas in 2001 . Iraqi policemen hold AK-47s during a police parade in the capital Baghdad 2003. The weapon, named for its inventor and the year when it was created, was never patented in Russia so was widely copied . The AK-47's story truly began in 1942, when Soviet soldiers siezed new-style automatic rifles from German troops. Unlike traditional or semi-automatic rifles, they could fire a whole magazine of bullets simply by holding down the trigger, because the recoil from each shot ejected the previous cartridge. Entrenched in the conflict of the Second World War, the Soviets set to work straight away on copying the Nazis' designs. But their first versions were clunky, weighing more than 5kg without bullets, and the task of creating a new design fell to Mikhail Kalashnikov, who had created an unsuccessful gun prototype earlier in the war. His design mashed together the best elements of previous weapons and won a competition in 1946, going into full production the next year. Accuracy was not its strongest point but it endured for its simplicity and reliability in even the harshest of conditions - built, as it was, in the wilds of Siberia. It was not patented - opening the door for millions of 'pirate' versions - because of the culture which existed in the Communist state. All ideas were property of the government, not one individual person, and pride came from helping the great Soviet army. Source: World Guns . There are an estimated 100 million . Kalashnikovs, one for every 70 people in the world. The gun is in . official service in 55 countries and adorns the flag of Mozambique. Its vast popularity was partly down to the fact its design was never patented, so it was widely ripped off. This was accelerated by the Soviet Union's policy of allowing friendly countries to imitate its designs of weaponry to strengthen its position during the Cold War. The Kalashnikov was prized for its sturdy reliability in difficult conditions. During the Vietnam war American soldiers reportedly threw away their M-16s in the harsh jungle and took every AK-47 they could find. The 205-year-old Izmash factory, which makes the weapon and is seen by Russians as a national icon, always complained that its . potential income was hit badly by the 'pirated' versions . of the designs made abroad. But . Izmash has also suffered from dwindling demand and a failure to make up . for this with foreign orders - a problem plaguing many specialised . post-Soviet industries. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met Mr Kalashnikov just three months ago, expressed his 'deep condolences' over his death. Born in a Siberian village as the 17th . child of his family on November 10, 1919, Mr Kalashnikov had a tragic childhood . during which his father was deported under Soviet dictator Joseph . Stalin in 1930. In October . 1941 he was heavily wounded and . shell-shocked in a Soviet defeat by the Germans. He reportedly first conceived of the weapon while recovering in hospital. Despite the lethal legacy of his weapon, Russia lavished Mr Kalashnikov with honours including the prestigious Hero of Russia prize, the nation's highest honour, for designing the iconic rifle. In 2007, president Vladimir Putin praised him, saying 'The Kalashnikov rifle is a symbol of the creative genius of our people.' The inventor had said he had never intended for it to become the world's most popular weapon, and he fell into making it by accident. Instead he had wanted to design farm equipment 'such as a lawnmower', he claimed. Yet he carried on working as the chief designer at Izmash well into his 80s. He profited little from his gun, and almost not at all before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Because of the lack of patent laws he was, like the inventors of more harmless global successes like Tetris, merely a state employee. 'I created a weapon to defend the fatherland's borders,' he said during an award ceremony at the Kremlin to mark his 90th birthday. Fame: Despite the advent of hundreds of other guns, the AK-47 by Mikhail Kalashnikov (pictured with his designs) led the pack for its hard-wearing simplicity and the ease with which it could be copied . The former Siberian peasant, pictured in 2002, continued working as a leading gun designer well into his 80s . Celebration: The ageing inventor had a complex legacy but was honoured as a Russian hero . Indirectly, Mikhail Kalashnikov leaves a bloody legacy. He claimed he would rather have invented a lawnmower . 'It's not my fault that it was sometimes used where it shouldn't have been. This is the fault of politicians.' On another occasion he said: 'After the collapse of the great and mighty Soviet Union so much c**p has been imposed on us, especially on the younger generation. I wrote six books to help them find their way in life.' There is a bronze bust of him in his . native village of Kurya in the Siberian region of Altai - and it is a . local tradition for newlyweds to lay flowers there. 'They whisper ""Uncle Misha, wish us happiness and healthy kids,"" he once said. ""What other gun designer can boast of that?""'

"Norwegian side Sandefjord have opened the door for controversial striker Ched Evans to join them. However, the Ministry of Justice have said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for him to play abroad, unless he is successful in the appeal against his rape conviction. This is due to the terms of his licence, which state Evans needs to meet regularly with their offender manager which would be difficult to do abroad. Ched Evans has failed to find a football club since his release from prison in October . Evans last played football in a Sheffield United shirt prior to his conviction in April 2012 . The 26-year-old is struggling to get a club in England as the adverse publicity and public reaction puts off clubs and sponsors alike. However, former Nottingham Forest and Derby County midfielder Lars Bohinen is manager of Sandefjord and has confirmed he would give Evans a chance. Bohinen said: 'I believe that when you have served your sentence, then a person should not be punished anymore. You should not be charged for it later. 'Yes, I would not have any problems [signing Evans if he performed during a trial]. It would be terrible if we would not let convicted people get back into the workforce.' Bohinen, pictured in his Derby pomp, is willing to hand Evans an olive branch in Norway . Talking to Dagbladet, he added: 'In theory, there should not be any issue with the club's sponsors. But the mechanism of football is such that you can quickly become influenced by sponsors today. 'It will cost society more should convicts not go back to a job. If you have you made a mistake there should not be any obstacle [to returning to work].'","The 26-year-old is struggling to get a club in England as the adverse publicity and public reaction puts off clubs and sponsors alike .

"Lutz Pfannenstiel is the ultimate journeyman. And so much more. The globetrotting goalkeeper played more than 400 games for 25 clubs across six continents, turned down Bayern Munich and signed for the Crazy Gang. He also spent 101 days in a brutal jail after being wrongly charged with match-fixing and was declared dead three times while playing in the non-League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lutz Pfannenstiel flaunting his skills with a SQUARE ball . Lutz Pfannenstiel played for 25 clubs and enjoyed a stint as Cuba's goalkeeping coach in 2008 . Pfannenstiel has enjoyed a truly unique career and hopes to stage a star-studded charity friendly in Antartica . Pfannenstiel attends the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2013 and participates in a discussion forum . It all began in conventional enough fashion, with Pfannenstiel tipped for big things after representing Germany at Under 17 level. But after declining the offer to sit behind Oliver Kahn in the Bayern pecking order, the youngster was grabbed by the wanderlust and left Bad Kotzing to head to Malaysia in 1993. The next year the Premier League came calling. But the seasoned pros at Joe Kinnear's Wimbledon were never going to go easy on the teutonic new boy. 'Two or three days after I arrived we went for a run in a park and suddenly someone gave some command, they grabbed me and got me undressed so I was completely naked in November in the freezing cold,' he said. 'They took all my clothes and my shoes and just left. I was lying in a ditch and wasn't sure what to do, then I had to run for three miles back with nothing on in front of loads of ladies walking their dogs. It's funny now but it wasn't funny at the time,' he told the BBC. Pfannenstiel failed to make the first team and moved to Nottingham Forest a year later, where he once again did not make an appearance. Pfannenstiel, who wrote a book called The Unstoppable Keeper, has enjoyed a remarkable career . Pfannenstiel poses with the German and English versions of his most entertaining tome . It is his second stint on these shores for which he is best remembered. On Boxing Day in 2003 (while playing for his twelfth club, Bradford Park Avenue) Pfannenstiel was accidentally struck in the chest by the knee of Harrogate United striker Clayton Donaldson. His lungs collapsed, and after performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the club's physio Ray Killick declared Pfannenstiel dead before managing to revive him. 'It wasn't like a kaleidoscope - there was no colour, it was all black and white. There were black and white diamonds and it was very quiet,' said Pfannenstiel. 'In the background there were figures but I couldn't make out who they were. I didn't feel cold, I felt all warm. I felt I was floating and it wasn't a scary feeling at all,' he told CNN. When he woke in hospital he complained of being substituted, and was back playing within a week. Now 41, Pfannenstiel reflects upon another dark period in his life; this time during his time in Singapore. 1991-93 Bad Kötzting . 1993-94 Penang FA . 1994-95 Wimbledon . 1995-96 Nottingham Forest . 1996-97 Orlando Pirates (loan) 1997 Sembawang Rangers . 1997 Tampereen Pallo-Veikot . 1998 FC Haka . 1998-99 SV Wacker Burghausen . 1999-2000 Geylang United . 2001 Dunedin Technical . 2001-02 Bradford Park Avenue (loan) 2001-02 Huddersfield . 2002 ASV Cham (loan) 2002-03 Bradford Park Avenue . 2002 Dunedin Technical . 2003 Bærum SK (loan) 2003 Dunedin Technical . 2004 Calgary Mustangs . 2004-06 Otago United . 2006-07 KS Vllaznia Shkodër . 2007 Bentonit Ijevan . 2007 Bærum SK . 2007 Vancouver Whitecaps . 2008 America FC . 2008 Hermann Aichinger . 2008-09 Flekkerøy Idrettslag . 2009 Manglerud Star . 2009-10 Ramblers . One minute he was a television personality and an Armani model, the next he was sentenced to 101 days in jail after being found guilty of match-fixing. 'In my case it was strange because I was actually accused of playing too well. Two games we won and one game was a draw where I was man of the match. If a judge in court tells you you've played better than you normally do it's not really logical. 'In the end I got out of it, the evidence was basically cleared as no money changed hands. 'I came out of that after 101 days and became a better person. It was the toughest time in my life but also the time when I learnt the most,' he explained to the BBC. He told CNN: 'The prison had no bed, no toilet, no toilet paper, no toothbrush. I slept on the floor,' he said. 'People were on death row. People got hung. 'For breakfast, they don't say good morning, they punch you in the face. I had to survive in that circus. If it was for 101 days, it felt like 25 years.' After becoming the only footballer to play professionally on all six continents, Pfannenstiel finally brought the curtain down on his career in 2011. He wrote a book, The Unstoppable Keeper, which was longlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award, and continued in the game, scouting for Hoffenheim and commentated on the World Cup for German television. And when he isn't doing that, he is consumed by his charity, Global United FC. He hopes to take some of his footballing friends,  including the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Jari Litmanen, John Barnes, Cafu and Lothar Matthaus to Antarctica to play a charity match to raise awareness of global warming. 'I want to leave the scene as if nothing had ever happened. We will clear the airfield using the snowmobiles, use yellow tape for the lines and we will build the nets. Within 10 minutes, the nets and lines are gone and nothing will be left. 'We will have scientists advising us and if they say we can play elsewhere, fair enough but at the moment, the airfield is the most convenient,' he explained to CNN. And rather like his playing career, you get the impression that Pfannenstiel is already planning his next move.","The retired German keeper can name 25 former clubs following an incredible career .

"When Mido started to build his reputation in European football with Ajax in 2001, much was expected from a powerful but nimble Egyptian striker. But 14 years on as the 31-year-old visited the Dutch giants' training camp in Qatar, that lean physique has obviously given way to a more significant presence. The former Tottenham and Middlesbrough striker, most recently with Barnsley in England, was sacked as manager of Zamalek in the summer and seems to have given up on keeping himself in shape. Mido, still just 31, posted a picture on Twitter on Friday as he visited his former club Ajax's training camp . Mido chats with Ajax manager Frank de Boer as he watches training in Qatar .

He impressed as a teenager in Egypt before progressing further with Gent and Ajax in Europe. The target man scored 23 goals in 40 games in the Eredivisie. He was then snapped up by Marseille in an £8million deal, only to be outshone by Didier Drogba in France. But that didn't stop Premier League sides declaring their interest. Mido struggled in Roma for two years before Tottenham finally brought him to England. Still a youngster, there was hope the forward could excel in a physical league. His scoring record at White Hart Lane suggested he could perform at the highest level, so when Spurs revealed they were willing to sell Middlesbrough were happy to take Mido off their hands. But eight goals in two seasons in the North East along with problems off the pitch did nothing for his reputation, nor did just two more goals during a short spell at Wigan. Both were penalties. Mido impressed at Tottenham on loan, with Martin Jol deciding to sign the Egyptian permanently .

But Mido's career deteriorated after a spell in the North East, he failed to get on target at West Ham (right) The striker celebrates scoring one of his two goals for Wigan, the opener against Arsenal in 2009 . An exile of sorts then followed for the Egyptian back in his home country, but it wasn't long until West Ham welcomed him back to the Premier League. Karen Brady once quipped that Hammers' striker Benni McCarthy was overweight and so wouldn't have been overjoyed with a now weary Mido, who didn't score in his nine league appearances. Barnsley were the latest team to welcome him but he played just one Championship game in 2012, while his international career also ended in tatters. Mido often fell out with coaches and was even banned for six months after arguing on the pitch with fellow former Wigan striker Amr Zaki. Egypt went on to win the African Cup of Nations without him in 2006. At the age of just 31, Mido should still be excelling in one of Europe's top leagues. He also struggled to fulfill his potential internationally, falling out with many Egypt head coaches .","Mido, still just 31, has seen his fitness levels deteriorate in recent years .

"Those anticipating a halt to the Alexis Sanchez One-Man Show during these winter months were again confounded by his all-action performance against Stoke. Two goals and one assist to add to his collection this season put Mark Hughes’s side to the sword and enhanced Sanchez’s position as the most potent forward in the Premier League. His £32million fee from Barcelona grows in value by the day. No player has been involved in more Premier League goals than Sanchez: 19. He has struck the back of the net 12 times himself, and made seven assists. Alexis Sanchez has hit the ground running since joining the Premier League with Arsenal from Barcelona . Sanchez celebrates scoring for Arsenal against Stoke City at the Emirates in the Premier League . Sanchez has been a huge hit at the Emirates since arriving from Barcelona for £32m during the summer . His cross for Laurent Koscielny to open the scoring at the Emirates on Sunday was inch-perfect, requiring the application of a most straight-forward of headers. Sanchez has played up front, in the hole and out wide – drifting in to cause mayhem. His first goal against Stoke came that path; from the left wing he had the strength to ride Steven N’Zonzi’s challenge, the silk to dribble into the box and dispatch a precise shot inside Asmir Begovic’s near post. The Chilean’s talent has never been in doubt. He starred for his country at two World Cups, and for Barcelona over three seasons. But the sheer bloody-mindedness he has approached English football has been remarkable. Many believed he would suffer a dip without the luxury of winter break; his body, that 5ft 7in muscular frame which allows his breathless style, would require a few weeks to rest and recuperate. That is not the indication so far. He has played 30 games in all competitions this season, many times man-of-the-match. At 26 he has plenty more years to make good on his early promise to become a club figurehead. Sanchez's attitude has been remarkable since his summer move to Arsenal after starring at the World Cup . Sanchez celebrates after he scored Arsenal's second goal in the 2-2 draw with Manchester City in September . Although Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is acutely aware of the dangers of overloading the team’s talisman, Oxlade-Chamberlain believes Sanchez’s natural energy can carry him through. ‘Alexis absolutely loves it. He is like a Duracell battery - he just does not give in,” the England midfielder said. ‘Whether it is a cup competition or times when you think maybe it could be a chance for him to come out and rest, he is the first one to say he wants to play and he always wants to be a part of it. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) has hailed Sanchez as Arsenal's 'Duracell battery' this season . ‘I am sure if the boss wants to rest him, he would respect that as well, but his attitude and the way he approaches training, you wouldn’t think he was tired and the way he is playing, you wouldn’t take him out of the side either. ‘Hopefully, he can keep his fitness and keep going, but the athlete that I see every day, I can’t see him falling short anytime soon.’ Thierry Henry watched on from the stands on Sunday, and the signs are Sanchez could become Arsenal’s first talisman since the Frenchman departed. It is not lip service to say legendary status awaits. Former Gunners legend Thierry Henry (centre) was in the stands on Sunday to witness Sanchez's display . Take Sanchez’s impact out of Arsene Wenger’s team and they would be 19th in the division. Clearly those statistics do not allow for another player to come in and potentially bridge the gap. But the extent of his importance is clear. Without those 19 contributions to goals, Arsenal would be 14 points worse off. Arsenal are out of the top four because their defence is susceptible to moments of comical collapse and their midfielder lacks a general to impose order. But, were Wenger to address these issues in the summer market, Sanchez is the player to spur a title charge. He is a player to build a team around, a dynamo whose energy and potential appears limitless.","Alexis Sanchez has scored 12 goals and made seven assists this season .

"Tuesday night’s FA Cup third-round replay between West Ham and Everton had everything the competition could possibly want. There were goals, controversy and end-to-end drama before the unlikely hero — West Ham goalkeeper Adrian — discarded his gloves and calmly side-footed home the decisive penalty in the shootout. It was a riveting, old-fashioned cup tie. Unfortunately it came too late for the FA’s beleaguered commercial department. The FA concede they face a losing battle in their botched search this season for someone to sponsor their flagship tournament. Adrian is mobbed after scoring West Ham’s winner in one of the most memorable games of the season . Adrian fired home the winning spot kick after hurling his gloves to floor during his run-up . Premier League . Barclays: £40m per year . Football League Championship, League 1, League 2 . Sky Bet: £6m . League Cup . Capital One: £5.5m . Football League Trophy . Johnstone’s Paint: Unavailable . Conference Premier, North, South . Vanarama: £700,000 . Northern and Southern Premier Leagues and Division 1 . Evo-Stik: Unavailable . Isthmian Premier, North, South . Ryman: Unavailable . When the top nine tiers of English football — and indeed any sports competition worth its salt — draw in millions of pounds in sponsorship, it seems ludicrous that the FA Cup lacks a backer. It is even more extraordinary that the FA have failed to find a partner when the new TV rights contract this season has seen the return of the BBC, who have given the tournament huge exposure over many platforms, with viewing figures up. It is not as if the FA did not have time to find a sponsor. It was known well over a year ago that Budweiser were ending their £9million-a-year deal. The FA were so confident of attracting a new backer at the same price — or higher — that they were briefing before the World Cup about a set of global partners to go with the main sponsor. Even last October, general secretary Alex Horne was adamant that a sponsor would ‘definitely’ be in position before the third round. But this has not happened and the fact that Horne is leaving at the end of the month does not help the sponsorship search. The FA say their hunt has been made more difficult by the price being beyond many UK-only budgets — they were looking for £10m-a-year-plus at the start — and attracting global corporations is tough. One company, understood to be another beer brand, was close to signing but the deal fell away. The FA have only themselves to blame for asking too high a price for a tournament that is in danger of losing its way in this Premier League-dominated era. Even Newcastle, a team with no relegation worries and for whom the Cup offers a rare chance of silverware, still fielded a weakened team. Holders Arsenal continue the defence of their crown with a trip to Brighton at the end of the month . Newcastle were one of several teams to field an under-strength side as the Magpies crashed out to Leicester . The FA also chose to revamp their commercial department ahead of the FA Cup hunt, parting company with experienced executives in Peter Daire and Sean McAuliffe and bringing in Phil Barker, Manchester United’s global sales manager, to add some of Old Trafford’s successful strategies. But United’s ‘scalpel’ tactics of splitting up sponsorships around the globe, as well as dressing up personalised branding for any potential backer, is plainly yet to work at Wembley. The FA board have been remarkably relaxed about the failure of commercial director Stuart Turner and his team to secure a Cup sponsorship but now they may have to contemplate the unthinkable and consider offering full FA Cup naming rights rather than the ‘in association with’ partnership to kick-start the search. If so, it would herald an ignominious chapter for football’s oldest competition.","The FA concede they face a losing battle in their botched search this season for someone to sponsor their flagship tournament .

"David Cameron is planning to retaliate against the EU’s shock bill for £1.7billion – as even a French politician admitted the demand was ‘madness’. The Prime Minister is said to be looking at ways to force Brussels to backtrack on the huge payment, which it wants by December. Insiders say the ‘nuclear option’ would be to block key measures the eurozone countries need to strengthen their ailing economies. Pierre Lellouche, a former trade minister under Nicolas Sarkozy, condemned the decision to levy the bill against the UK's growing economy, while France has seen unemployment soar . New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels . It came amid claims by a French former minister that the UK was being chastised for taking difficult measures to strengthen its economy – while other countries were being effectively rewarded for poor financial decisions. Pierre Lellouche, who was trade minister under President Sarkozy, said: ‘I think it’s ludicrous to actually go punish the one country that has suffered the reform.’ Even though Britain is not part of the eurozone, our agreement is required for any rule change by members of the single currency bloc. Experts said Mr Cameron could refuse to accede to calls by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for eurozone regulations to be enshrined in EU treaties. Or he could decline to agree to tougher powers over member countries’ debt, tax and spending. Last night a Number 10 spokesman said it was ‘premature’ to speculate on specific measures. The Prime Minister said on Friday he would not pay the huge surcharge, saying it had not made it any easier to persuade the British people to stay in Europe. It emerged over the weekend, however, that he may agree to pay a lesser figure – as much as the low hundreds of millions. The UK is being asked to pay around £1.7billion in part because its economy has performed better than expected over the past few years. At a summit in Brussels on Friday, David Cameron made clear his anger to other EU leaders about the charge . Germany and France, whose economies have fared worse, will get rebates – with the French receiving £790million. The EU Commission President will this week walk away from his job with a pension worth more than £100,000 a year just days after he presented the UK with a shock £1.7billion bill. Jose Manuel Barroso, 58, who retires on Friday after ten years in the role, will also receive a £20,000 lump sum, one month of his £240,000-a-year salary, plus a transitional allowance of between £290,000 and £473,000 over three years. Tory MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘The British people are fed up with the greed and arrogance of unelected EU fat cats like Barroso.’ A spokesman for Mr Barroso, who is being succeeded by Jean-Claude Juncker, said: ‘The Commission does not set the terms of commissioners’ salaries and entitlements, the member states do.’ The European Commission is likely to throw out the French budget later this week over its failure to implement austerity regimes. Its economy is now one of the worst on the continent, sparking fears it could become the ‘new Greece’. Mr Lellouche, who was part of the former centre-right government, said it was wrong for the UK to be targeted for its austerity programme. He said: ‘The results are showing up now – the unemployment rate has gone down to half what it is in France; the growth rate is four times what it is in France – and we go and punish the British? It’s madness. Calling the French economy ‘dead in the water’, he added: ‘And then we are going to reward the French socialists for having failed to fulfil their obligations – it’s crazy. I find it ironical that the French actually make money out of their failure.’ A spokesman for the French Institute of Enterprise told the BBC: ‘We are the sick man of Europe now. The future is Greece. Eurosceptic Tory MP Peter Bone warned Mr Cameron that he must not backtrack on his pledge not to pay the full £1.7billion bill. ‘The Prime Minister is right not to pay a penny to the European elite, which is completely out of touch,’ he said. ‘This is one of those times when he can’t back down.’ n One in five banks in the eurozone have still not learned the lessons of the financial crisis, it emerged yesterday. Some 24 out of 123 lenders failed ‘stress tests’ to see if they have raised enough capital to cushion against another meltdown. Four UK banks including RBS and Lloyds were also tested by the European Banking Authority – and all passed. Tory MP Mark Garnier said it was further evidence that Britain led the way in tough banking reforms. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon used a series of media interviews to condemn the charge from Brussels, but admitted that a sum of 'tens of millions; could be paid .","Pierre Lellouche says charging Britain for extra growth is 'ludicrous'

"A international women's footballer has told how she was forced to strip naked in front of officials to prove she was not a man. Genoveva Anonma, 27, had just led Equatorial Guinea to their first-ever African Women's Championship when sinister questions arose about her gender. Instead of celebrating her triumph, she was faced with having to take a crude and 'humiliating' gender test for members of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). She said: 'They asked me to take all my clothes off in front of officials from CAF and the Equatorial Guinea team. 'I was really upset, my morale was low and I was crying. It was totally humiliating, but over time I have got over it.' Scroll down for video... Genoveva Anonma says she was once forced to strip naked to prove she was a woman by football officials . In an interview with BBC Sport, the 2012 African Footballer of the Year said she was forced to take the test in 2008 after scoring the winning goal in a 2-1 triumph over South Africa. But she said it  isn't the only time the she has  face scepticism from her peers. At the 2011 Women's World Cup, Anonma was embroiled in a scandal about her gender alongside her international team-mates, sisters Salimata and Bilguisa Simpore. Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana accused the Guinea trio of being men due to their physical attributes. Anonma (left) says the incident came in the 2008 African Women's Championship for Equatorial Guinea . Anonma (left) currently plays in Europe for German giants Turbine Potsdam . 'You only need to have physical contact with them on the pitch to know this [that they are men],' said Ghana defender Diana Amkomah at the time. Once more, the 27-year-old slammed those allegations even offering to undergo medical gender testing in the expectation of silencing her doubters once and for all. Anonma, who plays for German giants Turbine Potsdam, says she has never had the chance to prove she has always been a female. 'I was hoping they would call me to tell me they were taking me to hospital to do tests, but they never did,' she added. 'They did nothing to me. It was just down to me alone to defend myself, to state that I am not a man, I am a woman.' Female South African athlete Caster Semenya was banned by the sport's governing body in 2009 over suggestions she was actually a man. She was eventually cleared after a series of gender tests . The most high-profile gender controversy in sport was that of female South African athlete Caster Semenya who faced worldwide scrutiny over suggestions she was a man. After claiming the world 800m title in 2009, she was subjected to invasive and embarrassing gender tests because of her muscular build and rapid improvement in times. She had also exhibited high levels of testosterone. She was sidelined from competition while the IAAF examined results of her tests and was even prevented from competing by officials after turning to a meet in South Africa. An official investigation eventually cleared her to return in July 2010. The IAAF said Semenya's case was and would remain confidential. But the sport's governing body did confirm that a panel of medical experts had determined she could compete as a woman.","Genoveva Anonma had just led Equatorial Guinea to African Women's title .

"Nicolas Anelka has denied the Football Association charge over his quenelle gesture and requested a personal hearing in a move which could bring a premature end to his career. The West Bromwich Albion striker has previously insisted that his goal celebration was not anti-Semitic and has requested a hearing into the charge of making a racially aggravated gesture, which carries a minimum five-match ban. But if Anelka is still found guilty after the appeal, the ban could be doubled. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Anelka's allegedly anti-Semitic gesture .

Click here to read our chief sports writer's debate column on Anelka's nasty strain of anti-Semitic Nazi posturing . A club statement issued after . Thursday's 6pm deadline read: 'West Bromwich Albion can confirm that . Nicolas Anelka has denied an FA charge regarding the gesture he made . after scoring his first goal against West Ham United on December 28. 'The striker has requested a personal hearing. The club will make no further comment until The FA’s disciplinary process has reached a conclusion.' As the player has just 16 games in which he can feature for West Brom between now and the end of the season, a 10-match ban could lead to West Brom seeking to cancel his contract for gross misconduct — or pay it up early — as he would be little use to head coach Pepe Mel in the fight to avoid relegation. At the age of 34 and with just two goals to his name this season, it is highly unlikely he will be offered another deal elsewhere in the Premier League. Anelka earlier pointed to comments made by a Jewish group in France that the quenelle could not be regarded as anti-Semitic in the context in which it was made. But later the same group clarified its stance, leaving Anelka looking increasingly isolated. Playing with fire: If Anelka ends up with a 10 game ban then West Brom could choose to terminate his deal . Roger Cukierman, president of the Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said: ‘It (the charge) seems severe to me because this gesture only has an anti-Semitic connotation if the gesture is made in front of a synagogue or memorial to the Holocaust. ‘When it is made in a place that is not specifically Jewish it seems to me that it is a slightly anarchic gesture of revolt against the establishment.’ Anelka has highlighted Cukierman’s words on Facebook, saying: ‘I therefore ask the English FA to kindly remove the charge made against me. And I repeat: I am not anti-Semitic or racist.’ Cukierman was then asked to confirm his stance in a later interview but said the gesture was initially conceived as anti-Semitic and that the player’s sympathy for it was ‘clearly suspect’. French comedian Dieudonne M’Bala M’Bala, who originated the quenelle gesture, has been questioned by police after bailiffs alleged they were fired on with rubber bullets at his house west of Paris. Salute: The 'quenelle' gesture originated from Anelka's friend, the French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala . Distanced: West Brom sponsors Zoopla have decided not to extend their deal at the end of the season . Meanwhile, two more of West Brom’s commercial partners may follow the example of sponsors Zoopla - a property website and part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline - who officially ended their two-year deal. German clothing company Jack Wolfskin and Holler Watches are both monitoring the situation. A statement issued by Jack Wolfskin read: ‘We consider the charges as serious and strongly disapprove of any gestures or statements which are meant to discriminate a single person or certain group of people. ‘We are now awaiting the judgement of the Football Association before taking further steps. Depending on what West Brom say... we would consider ending our sponsorship as one option.’ December 28, 2013 .

Defiant: A group performs the 'quenelle' salutes in front of a theatre where Dieudonne is performing . When West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football. But the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland. Here, we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala: . 'Quenelle' means 'scoop' or 'dumpling' and is performed by holding one arm straight by one's side while touching that arm's shoulder with the opposite hand. It has been described by its critics as a 'Nazi salute in reverse' and, thusly, as an expression of anti-Semitism. Forty-seven-year-old M'Bala M'Bala, who goes by the stage name of Dieudonne, has turned the 'quenelle' into something of a viral trend since first performing it four years ago. Once a committed anti-racism campaigner, Dieudonne has since been linked to the political far right in France. French interior minister Manuel Valls is considering banning all public performances by the comedian. In the wake of Anelka's public use of the gesture, which the player stated was simply a 'special dedication' to his good friend Dieudonne, French minister for sport Valerie Fourneyron described his actions as 'shocking' and 'disgusting'. Anelka has previously been photographed performing the gesture alongside Dieudonne but Saturday's events brought the debate to England while provoking further outrage and debate in France, where the match was televised. Dieudonne, who has past convictions for making anti-Semitic remarks, insists the 'quenelle' is merely 'an anti-establishment gesture' but his critics are concerned about its motivation. When Dieudonne insulted Jewish radio presenter Patrick Cohen this week, French interior minister Manuel Valls vowed to use any legal means necessary to ban any future public appearances by the comedian. Valls told newspaper Le Parisien: 'Dieudonne has been repeatedly condemned for defamation, insult and incitement to racial hatred. He is a repeat offender and I intend to act with the greatest firmness, under the law.' The English Football Association is considering opening an investigation into the possible connotations of the salute. FIFA rules state: '1. a) Anyone who offends the dignity of a person or group of persons through contemptuous, discriminatory or denigratory words or actions concerning race, colour, language, religion or origin shall be suspended for at least five matches. Furthermore, a stadium ban and a fine of at least CHF 20,000 shall be imposed. If the perpetrator is an official, the fine shall be at least CHF 30,000.'","Nicolas Anelka insists the gesture was not meant to be anti-Semitic .

"Brenda Leyland, 63, was identified as one of the people posting online hate messages aimed at the McCanns. Above, Mrs Leyland pictured this week . A church-going mother who was accused of trolling Madeleine McCann’s parents has been found dead in a hotel room. Brenda Leyland, 63, was found dead at a Marriott hotel on Saturday around 15 miles from her immaculately kept village home. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. Divorcee Mrs Leyland had been identified as one of a number of online ‘trolls’ posting a series of abusive comments about Kate and Gerry McCann, by Sky News last Thursday. She told a reporter who confronted her that she had been ‘entitled’ to make the comments using her Twitter identity @Sweepyface. Yesterday, her son, Ben, 20, who is said to be studying law in Los Angeles, posted the following brief tribute: ‘I love you mum and I will miss you forever’. His friends then began passing on their condolences on the site. Last night, neighbours of Mrs Leyland, who had continued using her married name, told of their shock at her death. One said: ‘Brenda kept herself very much to herself, but people were surprised when she was accused of trolling the McCanns. You don’t expect something that like around here. It’s a very quiet place. ‘But the village will be shocked by this news. I’m sure no-one would have expected her to do something like this. People didn’t condone what she is said to have done, but it is obviously very sad when anybody is found dead.’ Burton Overy was mentioned in the Domesday Book and is just 15 miles from the McCanns’ home in Rothley, Leicestershire. Mrs Leyland, who was educated at a convent school and studied at Goldsmiths, University of London, is among a group of hate-filled critics of Kate and Gerry McCann who have posted hundreds of vile messages about the couple online. The trollers wrongly believe the McCanns were involved in their daughter’s disappearance. Among the many comments attributed to Mrs Leyland on Twitter was one that said: ‘Q ‘how long must the Mccanns suffer’ answer ‘for the rest of their miserable lives’.’ On Friday, the day after her interview was broadcast, she disappeared from her home Leicestershire, neighbours said. Sky News said today in a statement: 'We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time.' Last week the father of Madeleine McCann called for an example to be made of ‘vile’ internet trolls who have been targeting the family. Gerry McCann said he had ‘grave concerns’ about letting his nine-year-old twins use the internet after threats of violence and kidnapping. The comments, in an interview with the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, came after it emerged that police are looking at a dossier of abuse posted on Twitter, Facebook and chat forums. Mr McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Praia da Luz in 2007, said he and wife Kate did not read such material because it was too 'upsetting'. Mr McCann said. ‘Clearly something needs to be done about the abuse on the internet. I’m glad to say that there have been a number of people where police have taken action. ‘I think we probably need more people charged.’ Asked about ‘@sweepyface’, Mr McCann said: 'I haven’t read her tweets ... I think that is an issue, that our behaviour is modified by this. Mrs Leyland was found dead at the Leicester Marriott Hotel, pictured, around 15 miles from her home . ‘We do not have any significant presence on social media or online. And I’ve got grave concerns about our children as they grow up and start to access the internet in an unsupervised capacity. ‘There have been other instances where people are threatening to kidnap our children. People are threatening violence against Kate and myself. ‘Of course it’s not just us - it is many other people who happen to find themselves in rather tragic circumstances. ‘I’m glad to see the law around this area is being reviewed. But I do think we need to make examples of people who are causing damage.’ The troll investigation featured in numerous newspapers including The Guardian, The Independent, The Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Daily Star, The Daily Express as well as the Daily Mail after Sky News exposed her identity as one of the trolls who targeted the McCanns. Residents of Burton Overy, pictured, where Mrs Leyland lived, were shocked to hear of her death. Her home is not pictured here . Scotland Yard is currently investigating the posting online of hundreds of hate messages aimed at the McCanns, both aged 46, whose daughter disappeared during a family holiday to Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007 . A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said: ‘Police were called at 1.42pm on Saturday 4 October to reports of a body of a woman in a hotel room in Smith Way, Grove Park, Leicester. ‘Officers have attended the scene and a file is being prepared for the coroner. Identification of the deceased is a matter of the coroner. The death is not being treated as suspicious.’ McCann spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: ‘Kate and Gerry will not be saying anything. It is entirely a matter for the police.’ A spokesman for the Marriott hotel said he had nothing to add beyond the police statement. Scotland Yard is currently investigating the posting online of hundreds of hate messages aimed at the McCanns, both aged 46, whose daughter disappeared during a family holiday to Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007, when she was aged three.The couple also have twins, aged nine. Brenda Leyland's body was found in the Marriott Hotel in Leicestershire - around 15 miles from her home and from the McCanns' home . Using the Twitter handle @sweepyface, Mrs Leyland posted dozens of messages attacking the McCann family . Detectives have decided to act after being given a dossier from McCann family supporters which catalogues the abusive remarks - including death threats - aimed at the couple on Twitter, Facebook and online forums. A Metropolitan Police spokesman last week confirmed officers were assessing the contents of ‘documentation’ which has been passed to officers and were consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service and the McCanns. Last night, a spokesman for Marriott Hotels International Ltd said: ‘We are very sad to confirm the death of a guest at the Leicester Marriott Hotel and our thoughts go out to the family and friends of the deceased. As this is a police matter and an investigation is underway, we are unable to comment further and enquiries should be directed to the police.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details .","Brenda Leyland, 63, was found dead at a Marriott hotel in Leicester .

"Leaning casually on the table with a cigarette in one hand as he watches his country’s satellite soar into space, Kim Jong Un’s pose is oddly familiar. Worryingly familiar, in fact – for it lends him a distinct resemblance to  Dr No, the original Bond villain.North Korea’s rocket launch on Wednesday earned Kim virtual global condemnation, alienating even long-standing allies such as China and Russia, while reports in the US suggested that the spacecraft might be ‘tumbling out of control’. One official described an earlier Korean rocket design as ‘a dishwasher wrapped in tin foil’. But at home, the 28-year-old dictator’s gamble was being hailed as a major triumph, with tens of thousands staging a mass rally in the capital, Pyongyang, as a tribute. Scroll down for video . Relieved: Kim Jong Un smokes a cigarette at the General Satellite Control and Command Centre after the launch of the Unha-3 (Milky Way 3) rocket carrying the second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite . Power . play: Taken by North Korea's official news agency shows leader Kim . Jong-Un giving the final order for the launch of the Unha-3 rocket on a . 1980s style phone sat in an office that looks equally dated . Hi-tech: The sombre scene of Kim Jong Un triggering the satellite rocket launch from a simple office is a world away from the scenes of jubilation at Nasa's Mission Control which greeted the Curiosity landing . North Korean authorities insist they  simply put a weather satellite into space. But much of the rest of the world sees it as a thinly disguised test of banned long-range missile technology. In 1962’s Dr No, the first Bond film, . Sean Connery’s 007 takes on Dr Julius No, who is plotting to disrupt a . US space launch with an atomic beam. Naturally, Bond foils the plan – pushing the evil scientist to his death in the reactor’s cooling vat. The photo was released as thousands . of people took to the streets of the country's capital of Pyongyang to . participate in a mass rally today. Meanwhile in South Korea, the rocket debris was recovered by the navy with inspectors analysing it to ascertain the rocket's techological capabilities. The launch came only eight months after a very public . rocket launch failure and less than a year on the job, the decision to go ahead was a big gamble for0 North Korea's . young leader. It paid off, at least in the short term, projecting Kim Jong Un to his people as powerful, capable and determined. On . the other hand it will increase his country's international isolation . and could strengthen the hands of the only entity that poses a threat to . his rule: the military. North Koreans gathered en masse in a staged demonstration, partly to glorify Kim and partly to celebrate the launch of the rocket, which Pyongyang says put a crop and weather monitoring satellite into orbit. The rest of the world saw it as a thinly-disguised test of banned long-range missile technology. The launch's success, 14 years after North Korea's first attempt, shows more than a little of the gambling spirit in the third Kim to rule North Korea since it became a country in 1948. 'North Korean officials will long be touting Kim Jong Un as a gutsy leader who commanded the rocket launch despite being new to the job and young', said Kim Byung-ro, a North Korea specialist at Seoul National University in South Korea. Sea of support: Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans rallied today in the freezing cold to revel in the country's successful rocket launch as South Korea voiced concern that its rival could follow up with a third nuclear test . Fired up: Left, North Korea's Unha-3 rocket lifts off from the Sohae launch pad in Tongchang-ri, North Korea; right, he retrieved debris from the first stage of the rocket on the deck of a South Korean milliary vessel at a naval base in Pyeongtaek, about 70 kilometers south of Seoul . North Korean state media said Kim himself issued the order to fire the rocket on Wednesday despite the prospect of another failure and condemnation from abroad. Kim was praised for boldly carrying out his father and former leader Kim Jong Il's last wish before his  death in December last year. Kim Jong Il had made development of missiles and nuclear weapons a priority despite international opposition and his nation's crushing poverty. His son's success is likely to help him consolidate his power over a government crammed with elderly, old-school lieutenants of his father and grandfather, foreign analysts said. But what is unclear is whether Kim will continue to smoothly solidify power, steering clear of friction with the powerful military while dealing with the strong possibility of more crushing sanctions against a country with what the United Nations calls a serious hunger problem. 'Certainly in the short run, this is an enormous boost to his prestige,' said Marcus Noland, a North Korea analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Inspection: The wreckage of North Korea's rocket is seen at the Second Fleet Command's naval base today in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. The debris is from the first stage of the long range rocket . Show . of support: A banner reading 'Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite 2nd version' is held aloft at a mass rally in Kim Il Sung Square in North Korea's . captial of Pyongyang to celebrate the success of a rocket launch . Military . might: Slogans honouring the leadership are displayed during the mass . rally organized to celebrate the success of a rocket launch that sent a . satellite into space on Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang . People power: North Koreans applaud near a slogan which reads 'ì(we) fervently celebrate the successful launch of the second version of the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite 2nd version' Regimented: Stern-faced soldiers celebrate the successful launch of the Unha-3 rocket, carrying the satellite Kwangmyongsong-3, at Kim Il-Sung Square in Pyongyang . Rank and file: North Korean soldiers attend a . mass rally organised to celebrate the success of a rocket launch that . sent a satellite into space at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang . Noland, however, also mentioned the . 'Machievellian argument' that this could cause future problems for Kim . by significantly boosting the power of the military - 'the only real . threat to his rule.' There . is also the question whether Kim, after thumbing his nose at the world . by firing the rocket, will continue to ignore the universal wisdom that . 'North Korea's only hope for escaping economic implosion is for the . country to open up economically,' said Robert Hathaway, Asia director at . the Wilson Center think tank in Washington. As . a cold wave lifted, tens of thousands of people gathered at the snowy . Kim Il Sung Square on Friday, some dancing in the plaza before the rally . began, continuing beer-filled street celebrations that had started on . Wednesday. Top officials told the people the critics abroad were characterizing the launch as a missile test. Denying the claims, they urged North Koreans to stand defiant in the face of outside condemnation. Inspection: . South Korean sailors stand guard today near a part of debris from the . North Korean rocket on a Navy ship at the 2nd Fleet headquarters in . Pyeongtaek, South Korea . Interesting cargo: The debris is believed to be a fuel container from the first stage of the rocket. Defence officials said South Korea has no plans to return the shell to North Korea because the launch violated U.N. council resolutions . Vital statistics: This photo has been annotated and released by the South Korean Defence Ministry via Yonhap. It shows the dimensions of the debris for the rocket, perched on a ship off the port of Gunsan . Missile madness: As the U.S. led international condemnation of what it calls a covert test of missile technology, top North Korean officials denied the allegations and maintained the country's right to develop its space program . Despite the success, experts say North . Korea is years from even having a shot at developing reliable missiles . that could bombard the American mainland and other distant targets. A . missile program is built on decades of systematic, intricate testing, . something extremely difficult for economically struggling Pyongyang, . which faces guaranteed sanctions and world disapproval each time it . stages an expensive launch. North . Korea will need larger and more dependable missiles, and more advanced . nuclear weapons, to threaten U.S. shores, though it already poses a . shorter-range missile threat to its neighbors. Successfully firing a rocket, however, was so politically crucial for Kim at the onset of his rule that he allowed the April launch to go through even though it resulted in the collapse of a nascent food-aid-for-nuclear-freeze deal with the United States, North Korea analyst Kim Yeon-su of Korea National Defence University in Seoul said. The launch success 'consolidates his image as true successor of his father's songun (military-first) leadership, but it will also deepen his country's economic isolation because sanctions will get tougher. 'That will hurt his image as an economically savvy leader and undermine his legitimacy for the next two to three years,' Kim said. Conference: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (C) talks with officials at the General Satellite Control and Command Center before the launch of the Unha-3 rocket . Decision-maker: In a sparsely-decorated office North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gives the order to launch the country's first three-stage rocket . All smiles: Kim Jong Un grins as he celebrates news of the rocket's successful launch at the  general satellite control and command centre in Pyongyang . The next big question is how the . outside world will react. U.N. Security Council condemnation has already . come; more sanctions may follow, both from the U.N. and individual . countries. Scott Snyder, a . Koreas specialist for the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote recently . that the launch and North Korea's nuclear ambitions should inspire . cooperation between the often wary U.S. and China, and South Korea and . Japan. If there is a . common threat that should galvanize regional cooperation 'it most . certainly should be the prospect of a 30-year-old leader of a terrorized . population with his finger on a nuclear trigger,' Snyder said. How advanced? The Korean letters inscribed on the debris read 'Un Ha'.  The debris, believed to be a fuel tank, will be analysed to determine its level of ballistic expertise, the defence ministry said . Tense: U.N.

"President Barack Obama has been on a third as many vacations as George W. Bush had at this point in his presidency, according a statistical analysis of the two presidencies that was published today. By CBS News Correspondent and White House historian Mark Knoller's count, President Obama has taken 20 vacations, including the one he is currently on in Martha's Vineyard, since he took office in January of 2009. Bush had taken a whopping 58 vacations midway through his second term, Knoller told Yahoo News. The current occupant of the White House still has his predecessor beat by a long shot in terms of the . number of fundraisers he's attended and golf games he's played, . however. President Barack Obama waves as he leaves the Sweet Life Cafe after having dinner at the restaurant last night with National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Attorney General Eric Holder and former Trade Representative Ron Kirk on Martha's Vineyard. Obama is still on the island but he has not left his vacation home yet today . President George W. Bush, left, reports on the fish count to the media during a fishing trip with his father, former President George H.W. Bush, right, and his daughter Barbara, center, during a family vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 2007. Obama is frequently criticized for the number of vacations he's taken, but Bush went on more . Obama has hit the links 186 times since taking office, according to Knoller's records. Bush only played 24 rounds of golf throughout his entire presidency. Then-president Bush put a halt to the hobby after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, explaining years later that he felt 'playing golf during a war just . sends the wrong signal.' 'I don't want . some mum whose son may have recently died to see the commander-in-chief . playing golf. I feel I owe it to the families to be in solidarity as . best as I can with them,' Bush said in 2008. Meanwhile, President Obama has went golfing three times this week already while on holiday in Massachusetts even as the U.S. launched airstrikes on Islamic extremists in Iraq and contemplated a humanitarian rescue of Iraqis stranded on a mountain. Bush attended far fewer political fundraisers that Obama while living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as well. In announcing Obama's 400th fundraiser as president on twitter Monday, Knoller said Bush had headlined 224 cash-gathering events at the same point in time. Bush has Obama beat in terms of the number of days he'd spent on vacation and the number of times he'd been on vacation at same point in his presidency . The frequency of Obama's golf outings and . appearances at events to raise money for the Democratic Party has . contributed to the perception that he has spent less time working . than his Republican counterpart. But Bush also spent substantially more days on vacation than Obama, Knoller notes. As of yesterday, Obama had taken a total of 129 full or partial vacation days compared to Bush's 381. And those are just the days and times Bush visited his Prairie Chapel ranch in Texas.  He also vacationed at his family's property in Kennebunkport, Maine, seven times for a total of 26 days. Knoller said he did not count trips to presidential retreat Camp David as . vacations. But even if he had, Bush would have Obama beat in that . category, too. Obama has . only taken 33 trips to Camp David throughout his two terms and has spent . a total of 84 days there. Bush frequented the getaway stop 108 times . over the same length of time and stayed there for a total of 341 days. Yahoo points out that not all of days Bush spent at his Texas ranch were true 'vacation days' as he sometimes played host to world leaders there. His getaways to Maine and numerous visits to Camp David more than offset the difference, however. To take the title of vacationer-in-chief from Bush, Obama would need to take 879 days off before the end of his second term, the Washington Post states.","Obama has taken 20 vacations compared to George W.

"Speculation is growing that the wife of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-Un has given birth in recent weeks, continuing the family dynasty into a fourth generation. Photographs seen on North Korean TV show Ri Sol-Ju wearing a neatly-fitting two-piece skirt suit in contrast to the loose-fitting clothing she was seen wearing in mid December and which suggested she was heavily pregnant. Adding to the speculation that Ri has given birth was her recent slimmed-down appearance at an official event, which included an all-woman band singing the Johnny Mathis Christmas favourite When a Child is Born. United: This screen grab taken from North Korean TV today shows North Korea's young leader Kim Jong-Un, right, and his wife Ri Sol-Ju, left. The images suggest that the leader's wife has recently given birth . Birth: The seemingly pregnant belly sported by Ri Sol-Ju in mid-December appeared to be gone in these recent pictures . Before-and-after photos were run on . South Korean TV and in Seoul newspapers today resulting in widespread . agreement that Kim Jong-Un’s wife has had a child. ‘The bulging stomach has gone down – has Ri Sol-Ju given birth?’ asked one newspaper, the Dong-A Ilbo. The . caption in another South Korean paper, the Chosun Ilbo, read: ‘Ri . Sol-Ju with her tummy reduced in 11 days. Has she come out right after . childbirth?’ The photographs have undergone the most intense scrutiny and the verdict is that Ri Sol-Ju is a mother. A South Korean government official, . quoted by the national Yonhap news agency concluded that Ri ‘appeared to . have already given birth based on analysis of the TV images.’ Whether North Korea will officially announce what would be the equivalent of a royal birth is open to speculation. Pregnant? Ri Sol-ju, centre, Kim Jong Un's wife, is pictured in December looking as though she may be expecting a child . Child: This picture in December of Ri Sol-Ju, second left, which was taken from the side, shows her apparently bloated frame . No official announcement was made that Kim Jong-Un even had a wife until state media eventually revealed it. But . the announcement came long after pictures had emerged of a . stylishly-dressed young woman accompanying the new leader at official . events. Kim Jong-Un was . elevated to leader of the secretive Stalinist state following the death . of his father, Kim Jong-Il, who had succeeded his own father, ‘Great . Leader’ Kim Il-Sung. According . to South Korean media, citing intelligence reports, the couple were . married in 2009 and already have one child. But that has never been . confirmed.

"Iran said it arrested a reporter for The Washington Post, his Iranian wife and two other Americans on unspecified charges. Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, told reporters that the 'Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue', the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. 'Iranian security forces are vigilant towards all kind of enemies’ activities, the official added,' the agency reported, without elaborating or naming the journalist. Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post's Tehran correspondent, and his Iranian wife Yeganeh Salehi in this undated photo. The couple and two other U.S. citizens were detained this week in Iran . Esmaili was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual 'Quds Day' rallies, held to express solidarity with Palestinians and oppose Israeli control of Jerusalem, The Washington Post reported. He went on to denounce the 'Zionist regime's recent crimes in Gaza' and called for the trial of Israeli leaders in international courts. It was unclear whether the grievances had anything to do with the arrests. The Post earlier said that its Iranian correspondent Jason Rezaian, his wife Yeganeh Salehi and two American freelance photojournalists had been detained, which U.S. officials confirmed. 'We have received credible reports that Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post and his wife Yeganeh Salehi were detained on Tuesday evening in Tehran,' the paper's foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, said in a statement. Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gives a speech in Tehran in July. Al Khamenei has the final say on all matters in Iran and has eventually released detained Americans in the past, though not always . 'We are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them. As the Post's correspondent in Tehran, Jason is an experienced, knowledgeable reporter who deserves protection and whose work merits respect.' The newspaper said Rezaian, 38, holds both American and Iranian citizenship. His wife is an Iranian citizen who has applied for U.S. permanent residency and works as a correspondent for a newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates. Joshua Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd were detained in 2009 while hiking along the Iran-Iraq border. Shourd was released in 2010, while the two others were let go in 2011 following sentences of eight years for spying . State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the department was aware of the report, but could not comment further due to privacy considerations. The incident comes at a tricky time for the U.S. and Iran. The countries are in negotiations over its nuclear program. The detentions come as the Iranian authorities step up pressure on independent journalists and bloggers, according to BBC News. At least 64 journalists and social media users are currently imprisoned in Iran, according to media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders. President Hassan Rouhani's election in August 2013 raised hopes of a change in attitude in how the government handles dissent, on which it cracked down following the 2009 democracy protests. Some reporters were released from prison and Ministry of Intelligence representatives in his cabinet began to take a more relaxed approach toward media. At the same time, journalists have come under renewed pressure from the judiciary and Revolutionary Guards, which operate outside the government's control. Rezaian, who has been the Post's correspondent in Iran since 2012, and the others are just the latest U.S. citizens to be detained in Iran, where they are typically held in solitary confinement for months or years and accused of being spies. Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd were picked up in 2009 while hiking near the border between Iran and Iraq's Kurdish region. The men were sentenced to eight years in prison, while Shourd was released on 'humanitarian grounds'. The other two were eventually released in 2011. Robert Levinson, Amir Hekmati, and Saeed Abedini have languished in Iranian jails for anywhere from one to seven years on charges ranging from espionage to ones related to religion.","Jason Rezaian, the U.S. newspaper's Tehran correspondent, and his Iranian wife were arrested on Tuesday evening .

"Google famously offers its employees everything from laundry facilities to volleyball courts  - and even naps pods and a slide. Researchers today said the firm may actually have the right idea - and that happy employees really do work harder. In a series of lab tests, they found happiness made people around 12% more productive. Scroll down for video . Google even provides a slide for staff to make them happier at work - and a new study claims it could help boost productivity . Employees are given: . Free food - both in restaurants and at 'microkitchens' dotted around the office . Free shuttles with fast wifi to work . Slides instead of lifts to get between floors . Meeting rooms themed to their country - for instance in London, a real London bus is used, while in Geneva, there are ski lift meeting rooms . Sports facilites - including gyms and sports courts . The researchers claim the study is the first causal evidence using randomized trials and piece-rate working that shows happiness does matter. The study, to be published in the Journal of Labor Economics, included four different experiments with more than 700 participants. During the experiments a number of the participants were either shown a comedy movie clip or treated to free chocolate, drinks and fruit. Others were questioned about recent family tragedies, such as bereavements, to assess whether lower levels of happiness were later associated with lower levels of productivity. 'The driving force seems to be that happier workers use the time they have more effectively, increasing the pace at which they can work without sacrificing quality,' said Dr Daniel Sgroi from the Department of Economics at the University of Warwick, one of the leaders of the research.

Dr Eugenio Proto said: 'We have shown that happier subjects are more productive, the same pattern appears in four different experiments. 'This research will provide some guidance for management in all kinds of organizations, they should strive to make their workplaces emotionally healthy for their workforce.'

"Nice have been prevented by FIFA from registering new signing Hatem Ben Arfa. The playmaker, a free agent after his release from Newcastle, joined Le Gym last Monday but was not available for Saturday's win over Lorient as he awaited international clearance. The problem was due to the clause in FIFA's transfer regulations which states a player cannot play for more than two clubs in the same season. Article 5.3 of FIFA's regulations on the status and transfer of players states: 'Players may be registered with a maximum of three clubs during one season. During this period, the player is only eligible to play official matches for two clubs.' Hatem Ben Arfa will now have to wait until next season to make his Nice debut . Ben Arfa played for Newcastle Under 21s and Hull this season but cannot play for a third team . Ben Arfa made eight appearances on loan at Hull - and an appearance for Newcastle's under-21 side earlier in the season has been ruled by FIFA to be an 'official' match. A statement on Nice's official website read: 'OGC Nice have received a copy of a correspondence sent by FIFA to the FFF (French Football Federation). The international federation responded to the question posed by the French federation regarding a match played by Hatem Ben Arfa with Newcastle Under-21s. 'Contrary to the position of the English (Football Association), it appears that for FIFA the match in the U21 Professional Development League 'must be considered as official in the sense of the regulation' and 'must therefore be taken into consideration in determining the application of article 5.3 of the regulation' on the status and transfer of players.' Nice's statement came after a FIFA spokesperson told Press Association Sport: 'Our services received an information request from the French Football Federation concerning the player Ben Arfa relating to art. 5 par. 3 of the regulations on the status and transfer of players. 'We can confirm that today we have responded to the FFF regarding their information request.' The development leaves Ben Arfa, who has 13 France caps to his name, in limbo. Hull manager Steve Bruce quickly fell out with the former French international as he failed to impress on loan . Hull pulled the plug on his loan deal after he fell out of favour with manager Steve Bruce, and a Newcastle statement on January 4 read: 'Hatem Ben Arfa and the club have reached an agreement to terminate the contract between both parties with immediate effect by mutual consent.' The match at the centre of the impasse was between Newcastle's Under-21 side and their counterparts from Reading on August 25. Ben Arfa scored his side's fourth goal in a 5-2 win. A previous statement from Nice on Monday expressed hope that 'sporting logic' would prevail and allow him to return to action in Ligue 1. The statement read: 'The return of the France international is not yet official from an administrative point of view due to a point raised by our federation (the FFF) with FIFA, despite a positive and unequivocal response from the English federation. 'The question raised by the FFF did not concern the first team but the match played in August by Hatem Ben Arfa, 27, with the Newcastle Under-21s. '(The FA) confirmed in writing to the French federation, when asked, that it is not in any case an official match - information which legitimises the position of the club and which has been sent to FIFA as we await their decision.' The former Lyon and Marseille ace endured a torrid time in England with Newcastle and has returned to France . Ben Arfa made eight appearances for Hull before falling out of favour with manager Bruce . Coach Claude Puel was asked about the issue at his press conference earlier on Wednesday, at which stage he was confident the move would be ratified. In comments published on the club's official website, Puel said: 'For us, his eligibility is not in doubt. 'The English federation wrote to the French federation and to FIFA explaining that the match played by Hatem (for Newcastle) did not count towards an official competition. 'We are optimistic and positive that he can return to France, return to Ligue 1 and, I hope, explode with OGC Nice.' Puel had hoped to be able to include Ben Arfa in his squad for this Friday's Ligue 1 clash with Bordeaux, but added: 'As a coach, you have to adapt to any situation. The team showed against Lorient that they are capable, even without Hatem.' Nice came from behind to beat Lorient 3-1 with goals from Eric Bautheac, Alexy Bosetti and Carlos Eduardo.","The midfielder joined Ligue One side Nice following release from Newcastle .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans should not play football again until at least 2017, according to West Ham's Chief Executive Karren Brady. Evans was jailed in April 2012 after being found guilty of raping a woman, but was released in October last year after serving half of a five-year sentence. He will 'have to wait a long time before he returns to football, if at all,' Brady wrote in her Sun diary, 'That's as it should be. At least to 2017 when he has served his full parole.' Ched Evans, 26, has struggled to find a new club following his release from prison in October last year . The former Sheffield United and Wales striker has been trying to resume his playing career since his release from prison, but has faced a backlash from wider society, with several campaigns launched against him returning to the pitch. Evans' supporters, however, feel that the striker has served his time and should be given the chance to complete his rehabilitation and continue his career. League One side Oldham Athletic had looked set to offer Evans a route back into football and held talks with the player, but the move collapsed amid external pressure from fans and sponsors, who threatened to pull their funding if Evans was signed. Evans had looked set to sign for League One side Oldham Athletic before the deal was canceled on Thursday . Before the deal fell through, Oldham's motives were unclear and Brady has mused, 'The employment of another striker, Lee Hughes, soon after release for causing death by dangerous driving suggests they see the club as a rehabilitation unit - or is Evans just a cheap item unexpectedly on the market?' Evans has maintained his innocence throughout the protests against him and is currently appealing against his conviction.

"Hatem Ben Arfa will have to wait until next season before making his Nice debut, Sportsmail understands. FIFA have responded to the French Football Federation’s request for a ruling on whether Ben Arfa can play for Nice this season, having already turned out for Newcastle United and Hull City. Rules state that a player can be registered with three clubs in one season but can only play for two of those. Hatem Ben Arfa might have to wait until next season to make his Nice debut . Ben Arfa played for Newcastle Under 21s and Hull this season but cannot play for a third team . However, the confusion arose because Ben Arfa’s appearance for Newcastle came in an Under-21 fixture. But it now appears FIFA have decided that was an official match and refused the former France forward permission to play. Ben Arfa signed for Nice earlier this month having been released from his contract by Newcastle. He spent the first half of the campaign on loan at Hull. Hull manager Steve Bruce quickly fell out with the former French international as he failed to impress on loan .

"A 19-year-old man had to be rescued this afternoon after he plunged through thin ice while playing hockey on a frozen pond in Massachusetts. First responders from the Hanover Fire Department got a call at around noon about a young man submerged in frigid water in the middle of Forge Pond. Minutes later, firefighters in orange cold-water suits arrived on the scene armed with an ice sled and quickly pulled the teenager to safety. Race against time:  It took Hanover firefighters nine minutes to rescue a 19-year-old boy whole fell through the ice on Forge Pond during a hockey game . Dangerous move: The teen said he ventured out to the center of the pond to retrieve his glove, and suddenly the ice beneath his feet cracked . The 19-year-old was conscious and responsive during the rescue, but hypothermic and weak after spending nine minutes in the water. According to officials, the boy used his hockey stick to keep himself from going under, reported the station WBZ. After being pulled ashore by firefighters, the teen explained that he ventured out to the center of the pond, some 150 feet from shore, to retrieve his glove while playing hockey with a friend. When the thin ice cracked under the boy's feet and he fell into the water, his companion called 911 and Hanover's fire chief was the first to arrive on the scene. A day before the rescue, the Hanover FD tweeted a photo of firefighters in cold-water suits getting training in ice rescue techniques.

"Lord Hope resigned amid allegations he helped cover up the behaviour of paedophile Robert Waddington . A leading Church of England prelate quit his post as a bishop yesterday, a week after being accused of covering up for a paedophile priest. Former Archbishop of York Lord Hope surrendered his position as a bishop in the Diocese of Bradford after a judge found he had protected the Very Reverend Robert Waddington from exposure, investigation and prosecution. But while stepping down, Lord Hope – who covered up for the sex abuser cleric while serving as number two in the hierarchy of the church – stopped short of apologising for the priests’s actions. He said in a statement: ‘After much prayerful and considered thought I wrote at the beginning of the week to the Bishop of Leeds and in the light of the Cahill Inquiry report I have submitted my resignation as Honorary Assistant Bishop of Bradford, now West Yorkshire and the Dales, with immediate effect. ‘This ends my nearly 50 years of formal ministry in the Church of England, which I have always sought to serve with dedication. 'I will certainly continue to pray for the important ongoing work with survivors.’ Lord Hope’s position as a bishop in Bradford came into question following publication of an inquiry report last week in which Judge Sally Cahill found that ‘because of the actions he took, and his inaction on other occasions, opportunities were missed for an investigation which may have led to a prosecution during Robert Waddington’s lifetime’, . The judge’s report added: ‘His concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount in his response to these allegations.’ Last week Lord Hope, who served as Archbishop of York from 1995 to 2005, greeted the publication of Judge Cahill’s report by calling it ‘flawed’ and a ‘disappointment’ and offering only qualified regret for the Waddington cover-up. The report found that Waddington, who rose to become Dean of Manchester, in charge of the city’s cathedral, was a lifelong paedophile who had attracted complaints in every decade from the 1950s. It suggested the suicide in 1989 of a former Carlisle choirboy may have been connected to abuse by Waddington in the 1970s, and it said a complaint laid against Waddington by Manchester Cathedral’s organist in 1989 was ignored. In 1999 an Australian bishop reported to Lord Hope complaints of abuse by Waddington in Australia during the 1960s. Lord Hope reported back that Waddington, by then retired in York, was desperately ill with cancer, lived a ‘hermit-like’ existence, and it was impossible that he could pose a threat to any child. Robert Waddington allegedly abused children for decades . He also told Waddington about the allegations in a face-to-face meeting and declined to involve police. But at the time, the judge found, Waddington was regularly taking services in York Minster and had access to rooms used by choirboys. Witnesses to the inquiry said he had been seen putting a chocolate bar into one choirboy’s pocket and had invited another boy to his home. The report listed seven breaches of church safeguarding rules by Lord Hope in 1999, five in 2003 and six in 2004. In 2013 the Waddington affair was thrown into the open when former Manchester choirboy Eli Ward gave detailed evidence of the abuse he had suffered. However Waddington died in 2007, his reputation intact. The present Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu, said yesterday: ‘I respect the prayerful decision made by my predecessor Lord David Hope. I am deeply saddened by his decision. ‘It did not come as a surprise to me when on the day the inquiry report was published Lord Hope said that “it is matter of great regret to me that 12 years ago when the non-specific anonymous allegations were first made in Manchester, the church and I myself were not more proactive in seeking out and/or assisting a reluctant complainant. Nor is it any comfort that other organisations were no more diligent at that time when dealing with similar situations”.’ Archbishop Sentamu added: ‘As the old saying goes “to err is human, to forgive is divine”. ‘The Inquiry into the alleged abuses by Robert Waddington led by Judge Sally Cahill has made its recommendations and these now need to be considered and action taken in a thoughtful and measured manner to ensure the church can be a safer place for all,’ Dr Sentamu said.","Lord Hope resigned from the Diocese of Bradford over allegations .

"A leading Iranian scientist being held in the U.S. over claims that he tried to buy equipment for Iran's rogue nuclear program, was released as part of deal to ease tensions. Mojtaba Atarodi was arrested in 2011 but in April the microchip expert at a Tehran university was allowed to return to his home country. The release was engineered as a way to bridge the distance between the U.S. and Iran, according to The Times of Israel. Exchange: Iranian scientist Mojtaba Atarodi is released in April after being arrested in the U.S. The newspaper claimed that Atarodi's return to Iran was part of secret negotiations between the two countries which led to the interim deal this month over Iran's nuclear ambitions. A series of prisoner releases by both sides is believed to have played a central role in the negotiations in Geneva. Still trapped: Robin Levinson disappeared in 2007 . Hikers Sarah Shourd and Shane Bauer were among the American prisoners released by Iran in 2010 and 2012. The U.S. has been holding secret . meetings with the Iranians in Oman for a few years, intelligence analyst . Ronen Solomon told The Times of Israel. He claimed that as a result of those meetings, the two countries had swapped prisoners, with all of them traveling through Oman. The prisoners swaps were linked to the accord agreed in Geneva last week calls for Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment for weapons and take several other steps to prove it is working towards a more permanent solution. In exchange, relief from some economic sanctions will be provided. The deal was struck after months of secret negotiations between officials from both Iran and the US, and finalized during talks involving five other world powers last Sunday in Geneva. Atarodi, who had a Green Card, was arrested for allegedly trying to buy equipment that could be used in the Iranian nuclear weapons program. As well as Atarodi, last year the U.S. freed Shahrzad Mir Gholikhan, who was convicted of three counts of weapons trafficking; Nosratollah Tajik, and Amir Hossein Seirafi. Tajik, a former ambassador to Jordan, was initially caught attempting to buy night-vision goggles from U.S. agents. He was later released after the U.S. decided not to follow up an extradition request it submitted to the British. Seirafi was released in January after being arrested in Germany and convicted in the U.S. of attempting to buy specialized vacuum pumps that could be used in the Iranian nuclear program. Three Americans - Robert Levinson, Amir Hekmati, and Saeed Abedini - are currently imprisoned in Iran. This month Mr Levinson, who disappeared in 2007, will become one of the longest-held Americans in history passing the 2,454 days Terry Anderson spent in captivity before being freed by Islamic militants in Lebanon in 1991, CNN reported.

"Sport in schools has slumped despite Coalition promises to create an Olympic legacy through education, new figures have suggested. Pupils spend less time in sport and PE lessons now than four years ago despite a drive to ‘inspire a generation’ to become more active following the London 2012 games. The average number of minutes of PE offered to pupils in England has dropped to well below two hours per week, according to a survey by the Youth Sport Trust. Scroll down for video . The drive to ‘inspire a generation’ to become more active following the London 2012 Olympic Games is failing . Students spend less time in PE lessons like gymnastics now than they did four years ago (posed for picture) Pupils aged five to seven spend just an hour and 42 minutes per week in PE lessons – nearly 25 minutes less than in 2010. The findings, coupled with soaring obesity rates among youngsters, paint a ‘bleak and worrying’ picture, according to Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the YST. The figures prompted head teachers to warn of an ‘inactivity crisis’ and call on ministers to make school sport a ‘real priority’. The Coalition came under intense pressure over its strategy for delivering an Olympic legacy after it scrapped £162million of ring-fenced cash for school sport. It also allowed schools to drop a target to offer at least two hours of PE a week and agreed to the sale of some school playing fields against the advice of its own panel of experts. In a partial U-turn, the Government unveiled a £150million-a-year PE and sports premium for primary schools, which David Cameron last year committed to continue funding until 2020. The apparent decline in school sport emerged in the biggest survey of its kind since the Coalition controversially scrapped an annual national study on sport provision, last undertaken in 2009/10. Responses from 1,392 primary schools and 554 secondaries showed that five to seven-year-olds spend an average of 102 minutes in PE lessons – compared to 126 minutes in the 2009/10 survey. Among seven to 11-year-olds, 114 minutes are spent in PE – down from 127 minutes recorded four years ago. A similar drop was seen among pupils aged 11 to 14, although levels of sport appeared to rise among 14 to 18-year-olds. The survey also showed a decline in the number of links between schools and community sports clubs since 2010. Sebastian Coe was rewarded for his success in organising the 2012 Games by being appointed the Prime Minister’s Olympics legacy ambassador in August 2012. The average number of minutes of PE offered to pupils in England has dropped to well below two hours per week since that time . Great Britain's Tom Daley training at the Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park in London in July 2012. A study shows  pupils aged five to seven now spend nearly 25 minutes less per week in PE lesson than in 2010 . The YST admitted it was difficult to make direct comparisons with the 2009/10 Government study, which had covered virtually all schools in the country, but insisted its data was ‘statistically reliable’. The charity launched a manifesto yesterday calling for more lesson time to be devoted to PE and ‘sustained competitive sport in schools’. Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust, said the level of physical activity in primary schools paints a 'bleak and worrying picture' Baroness Campbell said: ‘Reversing the growing levels of physical inactivity amongst young people is a seismic challenge. ‘With one in three children leaving primary school obese or overweight, and less than one in five meeting the minimum recommended guidelines for physical activity, it is a bleak and worrying picture.’ The charity also pointed to research suggesting that plenty of physical activity can lead to improvements in academic achievement. Baroness Campbell went on: ‘We have set out where we believe any future government should focus its efforts if we are to stand any real chance of reversing the worrying trends that are leading to increasing sedentary lifestyles amongst young people.’ The Department for Education said that last year it commissioned its own survey of 586 primary schools which showed their pupils spent an average of 122 minutes each week doing PE, up 13 minutes on 2013. A DfE spokesman said: ‘As part of our plan for education, we want children to get into the habit of playing and enjoying sport – both in lessons and after school. 'That’s why we are giving primary school headteachers over £450 million of funding to spend on improving PE – and our own research shows they are using it to deliver more and better sport. ‘Our findings show that primary schools are delivering more than two hours of PE each week, and it has increased by an average of 13 minutes in the last year; 83 per cent of schools also reported an increase in participation in after-hours sports since the introduction of the funding. ‘We are pleased that the Youth Sport Trust’s own figures show that PE lesson time has actually increased for pupils in years 10 to 13.’","Pupils spend less time in sport and PE classes now than four years ago .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has revealed how he broke down in tears after hearing one victims experience of child abuse . The Archbishop of Canterbury has told how he broke down in tears after hearing first hand the 'horror' of child abuse in the Church of England. The Most Rev Justin Welby said the sexual abuse in the Church was 'beyond description – terrible' and that he had been profoundly moved by his meetings with survivors. He revealed that all Church of England clergy will be audited for signs they are abusers. The Archbishop conceded that investigations into clergy going back more than 60 years would show that 'there is more that has not been revealed'. He said the harrowing accounts he heard at one face-to-face meeting with a victim still haunted him later in the day when he was asked about the issue at a talk at a theological college. Speaking at a Westminster lunch this afternoon he said: 'To my intense surprise, because I don't normally do this kind of thing, I broke down completely. 'It was the shredding effect of hearing what we did, what we did, to those people and the sense of total failure and betrayal. 'So we are taking it, and I am passionate about this, as seriously as we are able to do.' He added: 'It is beyond description terrible. When you abuse a child or a vulnerable adult, you mark them for the rest of their lives,' he said. Churches fall within the scope of the major review into child sex abuse within state and non-state institutions ordered by Home Secretary Theresa May. He said: 'Many institutions failed catastrophically, including in the media, children's homes, foster parents, all kinds of areas. But the church is meant to hold itself to a far, far, far higher standard and we failed terribly.' Every 'blue file' personnel record since 1950 - including those of dead clergy - was being closely examined for 'anything in the file that would suggest at all that there is anything that needs following up'. In nine out of 10 cases such concerns proved unfounded or involved cases where all involved were now dead, he said, but the inquiry team, headed by the Bishop of Durham, would bring the rest forward 'transparently and openly'. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (right) and the Lord Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu (left)  have hit out at historic abuse in the Church . The process was being overseen by an external body to avoid any claims of a cover-up, he stressed. 'The rule is survivors come first, not our own interests,' he added. 'However important the person was, however distinguished, however well known, survivors come first.' The Archbishop also spoke about highly-controversial moves to examine whether the confidentiality rules should be relaxed to allow clergy who heard confessions about sex abuse could alert the authorities. A General Synod measure to initiate a study on the issue was an 'incredibly radical move which challenges more than 1,800 years of church tradition', he said. 'We haven't decided what we are going to do with it yet but we are starting to look at how we could deal with that.'","Most Rev Justin Welby said sex abuse  was 'beyond description – terrible'

"Gareth Southgate has reaffirmed his commitment to the FA by signing a 12-month contract extension. The England Under 21 head coach, who has guided his squad to this summer European Championships, had 18 months remaining on his current deal. Those terms would have expired in the middle of qualification for Euro 2017 and the FA were keen to extend his deal beyond that date to incorporate the tournament in its entirety. England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate, pictured at Goodison Park last weekend, has signed a new deal . Southgate instructs his Under 21 players during a training session at St George's Park in October . Southgate took over from Stuart Pearce in August 2013 and has overseen a dramatic improvement, with the Under 21s winning 12 of the 14 matches he has been in charge for, suffering only one defeat in a friendly to France. They will warm-up for Euro 2015 with friendlies in March against Czech Republic and Germany at the Riverside in Middleborough. Southgate said: 'I am enjoying my work at The FA and with St. George’s Park coming to life with innovation and development across our football disciplines I believe we now have some solid foundations in place. 'England DNA is evolving but anyone who has seen our development teams play – including the Under 21s – will know that many of the principles can already been seen in the way we go about our work.

It is a big challenge, but an exciting one.' FA Technical Director Dan Ashworth added: 'Gareth is an outstanding individual to work alongside and I am happy to see him commit further to his work with the Under 21s and to football development at The FA. 'We are looking forward to the European Championship this summer and testing our young players against Europe's elite. With Gareth in place we will hope to qualify for the 2017 European Championship to continue our players' education and development. 'Gareth’s close working relationship with Roy Hodgson is certainly helping the transition of our players through to the senior team.'","Gareth Southgate had 18 months remaining on his England Under 21 deal .

"Premier League footballer Ravel Morrison, 21, walked free from court today after prosecutors withdrew charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor and her mother Parveen . Premier League footballer Ravel Morrison walked free from court today after prosecutors withdrew charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother. The 21-year-old West Ham player had been accused of hitting his ex Reah Mansoor, 19, and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, after a night out at a nightclub in his home city of Manchester last July 24. He was due to go on trial at Manchester Crown Court later this month but today the charges were dropped by the prosecution and Morrison, who was not in court, was found not guilty. Guy Mathieson, prosecuting, told the court the charges had been withdrawn after Morrison's defence team recovered CCTV footage of the first alleged assault outside the One Central nightclub, in Manchester city centre. It showed that Morrison had not hit his ex, as was alleged, and she had 'slumped' to the floor on her own. The ex-girlfriend also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off and the court heard there was 'reluctance' from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her. All three charges of assault were withdrawn. Morrison had also been initially accused of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex and have her shot during a four-year period of harassment. But at a hearing last November the harassment charge was also withdrawn by the prosecution and he was found not guilty on those charges. Morrison is currently back with West Ham after a loan spell with Cardiff City. He was first arrested last August after it was alleged that, during a night out, he assaulted his ex and, after 'bundling' her into his Porsche Panamera car, took her home to her mother's house in Salford. When they got back to the house, he is alleged to have assaulted Miss Mansoor again, as well as her mother. But Mr Mathieson said Morrison's lawyers had got the CCTV footage from an office building which captured the alleged first assault. He said that, in her statement, Miss Mansoor said she remembered her boyfriend standing in front of her and then waking up on the floor with him standing over her. The 21-year-old West Ham player had been accused of hitting his ex Reah Mansoor, 19, (left) and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, (right) after a night out at a nightclub in his home city of Manchester last July 24 . Mr Mathieson continued: 'When reviewing the CCTV footage, it's clear there's a gap she doesn't remember between those two statements. 'She's seen falling, or slumping to the ground, remaining there for a minute or two before, quite clearly, the defendant and her friend come to her assistance, trying to get her to stand up. 'And it is right, thereafter, the Porsche Panamera, the defendant's car, is seen to come, she's put, bundled or half-carried into the car and she's then taken home. 'It's quite clear from that CCTV footage there's no assault at that stage. 'The Crown have to accept there's a gap in the evidence and the Crown is in the position where they have to reconsider the prospect of a conviction and offer no evidence in respect of count one.' Morrison in action for West Ham against his former club Manchester United. He is thought to be considering a move to Serie A side Lazio, who want to sign him on a pre-contract . The prosecutor told the court that in light of the CCTV footage clearing Morrison of the first alleged assault, the Crown were also offering no evidence and not proceeding with remaining alleged offences. He added: 'Clearly Reah Mansoor's credibility, accuracy perhaps more appropriately, is somewhat called into question by the contents of the CCTV. 'The Crown is also aware that she has provided a retraction statement, or withdrawal of support and there's an element of reluctance in respect of the mum. 'The Crown offer no evidence on counts two and three.' Judge David Stockdale QC replied: 'Mr Mathieson, I'm sure the Crown has been very well advised. I endorse. 'I direct that not guilty verdicts be entered in relation to counts one, two and three.' The footballer was due to go on trial at Manchester Crown Court later this month but today the charges were dropped by the prosecution and Morrison, who was not in court, was found not guilty . Morrison had briefly been held in custody after he was first arrested. He was then bailed but only on condition he stays out of Greater Manchester except to either see his solicitor, come to court or play in a football match with his team. Morrison started his football career with his home town club of Manchester United where he was touted as one of their brightest future prospects. But he only played in the League Cup before the club's then boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. He was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham, QPR and most recently Cardiff City before returning to West Ham United where, despite his undoubted footballing talents, he appears to have no future. He is thought to be considering a move to Serie A side Lazio, who want to sign him on a pre-contract .","West Ham player, 21, was due to go on trial later this month .

"Prosecutors have dropped the case against 13 footballers investigated over alleged match-fixing after considering the reliability of evidence from 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was 'insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction' in the case in light of the collapse of Tulisa Contostavlos' trial. The former X Factor judge was cleared of brokering a cocaine deal in July last year following a newspaper sting led by Mr Mahmood, after Judge Alistair McCreath said there were 'strong grounds' to believe The Sun On Sunday reporter lied in the witness box. Collapse of Tulisa Contostavlos' trial raised concerns over match-fixing investigation . Contostavlos' rapper friend Mike GLC - real name Michael Coombs - was also cleared after he pleaded guilty to supplying cocaine. A CPS spokeswoman said: 'A file was passed to the CPS in July 2014 from the National Crime Agency (NCA) in relation to alleged football match-fixing in 2013. This case involved evidence in relation to 13 suspects. 'The reliability of the evidence of one alleged witness in particular had to be very carefully considered in light of recent events in the trial of R - v - Contostavlos and Coombs. 'This was not the only evidence that was considered and when all the evidence submitted by investigators was carefully reviewed in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. DJ Campbell was one seven players from Football League clubs arrested in connection with alleged spot-fixing . 'We have informed the NCA of this decision and they have written to the suspects announcing that no further action will be taken.' The 13 footballers were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged bribery and money laundering, the NCA said. In April, seven players from Football League clubs based in the north-west of England were arrested in connection with alleged spot-fixing and another six were rearrested over the claims. The original six suspects were arrested as part of the inquiry in December 2013, prompted by information passed on by the Sun on Sunday. The tabloid reported that an undercover investigator met former Portsmouth player Sam Sodje, who allegedly said he could arrange for footballers in the Championship to get themselves a yellow card in return for tens of thousands of pounds. The 35-year-old also claimed he could rig Premier League games and even said he was preparing to fix matches at next year's World Cup in Brazil, the newspaper reported. Former Portsmouth player Sam Sodje will face no further action after the case was dropped . At the time Portsmouth said Sodje no longer played for the club, but they would co-operate fully with any investigation if approached by the authorities. It was also claimed that Oldham player Cristian Montano failed to get a yellow card in return for money in a match against Wolves on October 22 and offered to take part in another rigging incident. Blackburn striker DJ Campbell was confirmed to be one of the six players who were arrested in December 2013. Last month, the CPS said it was re-examining criminal convictions in 25 cases where evidence was given by Mahmood and it had offered no evidence in three live cases where the undercover reporter was a prosecution witness. Mahmood, a former reporter for the News of the World, was suspended after the collapse of Contostavlos' trial. In September, several trials at Southwark Crown Court in London were halted because they relied on evidence from the undercover reporter. The CPS offered no evidence against Dr Majeed Ridha and pharmacist Murtaza Gulamhusein, who were accused of illegally supplying an abortion drug. And fixer to the stars Leon 'Starino' Anderson and co-defendant Ashley Gordon, 21, had drugs charges dismissed after prosecutors said Mahmood was not reliable.","The 13 footballers were arrested as part of an investigation into alleged bribery and money laundering .

"Police have released CCTV images of two people they wish to speak to after Jordan Brennan (pictured) was found dead . Police have launched a murder inquiry following the death of a teenager who was attacked outside a grocer's store. Jordan Brennan, 17, was assaulted by a man as he left the shop in Gorton, Manchester, on Friday at about 7.30pm. Emergency services were called to his home address the following day at about 9am after he was found unresponsive in bed. He was pronounced dead at the scene and a post-mortem examination later found the cause of death was a head injury. Police have launched a murder inquiry and want to speak to a man and woman about the incident at the shop on Hyde Road. Detective Inspector Theresa Carter said: 'Jordan was very well known and liked and both his family and the wider community are deeply shocked and saddened by what happened. 'At this stage we know that Jordan was assaulted outside the grocer's store, but we don't know exactly what led up to the assault. 'I would also ask that the man involved contacts the police so that we can fully understand what happened inside and outside the shop. We would also like to speak to the woman who he was with.' Police have issued CCTV images of the man and woman they wish to speak to. Both are of Chinese appearance and aged about 25 to 30. The man had a stocky or chubby build and black hair and was wearing a white shirt and a black suit jacket and trousers. The woman was slim and had long black straight hair. In a statement, Jordan's mother, Kim, said: 'Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man. Police want to speak to this couple about the assault outside the grocer's store on Friday night . 'He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend.

"Austria's Rubin Okotie may think twice about marking Sweden star Zlatan Ibrahimovic during the pair's next meeting given the frightening glare he received for simply touching the striker on Monday night. Sweden were about to take a corner during the Euro 2016 qualifier as Okotie lined up in front of Ibrahimovic before giving him a slight nudge in the chest.

"Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson insists his runaway league leaders are ready to answer Fraser Aird’s taunts in convincing style at Ibrox on Friday night. Responding to new Gorgie striker Genero Zeefuik’s claim that a win for the Tynecastle side would end the Championship race, Aird brushed off the Dutchman’s comments as ‘disrespectful’ and insisted Rangers were still the better team. Ibrox caretaker boss Kenny McDowall intervened yesterday by ordering his 19-year-old midfielder to do his talking on the park instead. New Hearts striker Genero Zeefuik fueled the fire ahead of his side's top of the table clash with Rangers . Rangers youngster Fraser Aird claimed that Zeefuik's comments were 'disrespectful' to their title hopes . And that was a sentiment shared by Neilson last night when he declared: ‘We’ve done all our talking on the pitch so far - and we’ll do it again at Ibrox tomorrow night. ‘There is no need for us to say we’re going to do this or that, or to start talking about what other teams will do. The game isn’t won in the papers. It’s won on the training ground and on the pitch. ‘We could quite easily come out and say something back. But we don’t need to. You are better concentrating on your own team, your own performance as a player or a coach. Go and do it on the pitch, that’s where it counts.’ McDowall also insisted that Aird would would be better off proving his side are a match for the Jambos as opposed to saying it. Jambos manager Robbie Neilson (left) insisted his team were ready to show Rangers they mean business . Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowall said Hearts deserved to be 13 points clear at the top of the league . ‘I believe he (Aird) said it was disrespectful - what their player said. That is fine, I don’t have an issue with that,’ said McDowall. ‘It is okay saying it but the Hearts boys are 13 points clear so they have a right to say what they want to say. ‘Absolutely you should be confident but keep a lid on it, do your talking on the park.’ Asked if he felt the league table was presently an accurate assessment of where the respective clubs were, he replied: ‘No I can’t argue with it. Hearts have gone unbeaten. I can’t say Hearts don’t deserve to be where they are. ‘They’re a tough team, like Hibs are as well. But I could also say that about Alloa. They gave us a tough match as well in the games we’ve played them. ‘Every game we play is tough and it’s been tough against Hearts. But they’ve been close games so I wouldn’t say they’re miles better than us, no,’ added McDowall, who insisted he wants to keep Kris Boyd at Ibrox despite the striker being out of the picture. McDowall expressed his desire to keep Rangers regular bench-starting striker Kris Boyd at Ibrox . Jon Daly warned the rest of his Rangers team-mates not to make the same mistakes as in the reverse fixture . Rangers striker Jon Daly turned up the heat a little more yesterday by insisting Hearts’ players tried to con the referee when the sides last met in a 2-0 victory for the Jambos at Tynecastle in November. ‘I felt they went down fairly easily and rolled about a bit and I still think they did and my opinion hasn’t changed,’ he said. ‘That’s something we are going to have to be wary of this time round and make sure we don’t give the ref any decisions to make.’ Daly also believes a win for Rangers tonight will crank up the pressure on their rivals, especially with one game against the sides yet to come in the capital. ‘If we win we’ll have clawed at a gap that was 15 to 10 - that’s 33 per cent off,’ he said. ‘It’s a big chunk of points. We’d still need them to drop points elsewhere and make sure we keep winning games.’","Hearts' Genero Zeefuik said win on Friday would end Championship race .

"Andros Townsend has revealed how he offered Roberto Soldado words of consolation at half-time after the out-of-form striker missed from three yards out against Burnley. Soldado has not scored for almost a month but Townsend gave him the easiest of finishes when he picked him out at the back post with a low cross in their FA Cup third-round victory on Wednesday night. But the forward’s confidence plumbed further depths when he somehow managed to hit the crossbar. Townsend ran over to his team-mate when the half-time whistle went just moments later in an attempt to help. Spurs striker Roberto Soldado (right) contrived to miss a chance to score with the goal gaping . The Spain international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as White Hart Lane . Andros Townsend (left) has revealed that he offered some words of encouragement to Soldado at half-time . ‘I felt for him,’ Townsend said. ‘I have been in that position before where just nothing will go in for you. He played well but as a striker I think he just wanted that goal. ‘I just ran over to him as we walked off at half-time and tried to keep his spirits up. I just told him to forget about the miss and keep going. ‘I said I would try to put another cross in for him and that if he kept getting into the positions then he would get a goal. That didn’t happen sadly but five minutes into the second half he put in an assist for Danny Rose.’ Soldado has only managed to score four goals in all competitions this season . Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino reacts after Soldado's miss during their FA Cup match against Burnley . Setting up Tottenham’s fourth of the night was at least some consolation for Soldado, who was also unfortunate when Ross Wallace’s free kick took a vicious deflection off him to wrong-foot Michel Vorm and bounce in for Burnley’s second. Manager Mauricio Pochettino defended the player afterwards, but patience is wearing thin for a player who cost £26million 18 months ago. Townsend, however, has backed Soldado to eventually find form. ‘Look Robbie is a fantastic character he will pick himself up and dust himself down,’ he added. ‘He continued to look dangerous in the second half and I was delighted he played well. ‘We have seen in Spain he is a fantastic striker. He just needs the service and the game time. Then once he gets one or two goals I am sure the goals will start flowing.’","Roberto Soldado missed from close range against Burnley on Wednesday .

"Moeen Ali is determined to carry on with the aggressive approach that has seen him become a key figure at the top of England’s order and has vowed to go ‘hard’ at Australia when cricket’s old enemies resume hostilities on Friday. If anyone epitomises the brand of cricket England will need to produce if they are to catch up with the pioneers of the one-day world then it is Moeen, who is determined to take his fearless approach all the way to the World Cup. Moeen has been the best of the six openers England have used in 50-over cricket in the year leading up to the premier one-day tournament and has made it clear that if he is to go down at this World Cup then it will be fighting. Moeen Ali appeared in good spirits  as he was put through his paces during a net session in Canberra . The 27-year-old has a strike rate of 109 in the 12 50-over matches he has played so far for England . ‘It’s the only way I can play in one-day cricket,’ said Moeen, who made a 38-ball 50 in England’s opening tour match here in Canberra. ‘Sometimes I face 30 balls and I feel as though I’ve had 50 or 60 already. ‘It’s natural for me to be aggressive and is the sort of thing I’ve done for a few years now. I feel it’s the best way for me to play and if I’ve got any doubts in the middle I just tell myself to keep on going hard and not go into a little shell.’ That means he will not be put off by the odd ugly dismissal, such as the first ball duck with which he ended the one-day tour of Sri Lanka. ‘It’s not nice getting out first ball but I’d prefer to go having a slog than just blocking it,’ he said. The promotion of Moeen, 27, as an opener has been one of the few recent successes for England as they continue playing catch-up in one-day cricket. Moeen in action at the crease during England's match against an ACT Invitation team at the Mankuva Oval . Moeen touches gloves with Ian Bell who he is likely to open with for England rather than Alex Hales . He has a strike-rate of 109 in the 12 50-over matches he has played so far and made a brilliant 119 off 87 balls in Colombo to prove that he just as important to England in white-ball cricket as in the Test game. But he insists there is more to come, ideally starting in Wednesday’s match against a Prime Minister’s XI and then the tri-series against Australia and India here that precedes the World Cup. ‘I definitely feel I can get better,’ he said. ‘It’s been one year of international cricket for me now and I feel like I’ve got better already so hopefully I can improve more. I do feel like I’ve got a lot more to show. It’s early days and there will be some tougher tests, like Australia, and that will be a real challenge.’ England meet the team that humiliated them this time last year in Sydney in Friday and in Hobart next week before the much-anticipated World Cup opener between the sides in Melbourne on February 14. Moeen, in action on Monday, hopes he and Bell will forge a strong opening partnership for England . James Anderson holds nothing back as he bowls to Matthew Condon during England's warm-up match . ‘Each match now is a chance to show we’ve taken a step forward as a team and that we have intent and will come harder at Australia than perhaps we have done previously,’ said Moeen. ‘We just need to focus on what we need to do. ‘The standard of the opposition in our first game wasn’t as good as it will be but we showed we can be ruthless. That can only be a good thing.’ The sacking of Alastair Cook provided England with a chance to show that they will throw off their shackles here but they have only gone so far and it now seems certain Ian Bell rather than Alex Hales will open with Moeen. ‘When I started at Warwickshire Belly was there and I enjoy batting with him,’ said Moeen. ‘He’s quite busy, he’s good at getting singles as well as boundary shots and is a classy player. Hopefully we will be a good combination. Mitchell Johnson, celebrating a wicket against India, will miss the opener against England through injury . ‘I think out styles complement each other. We’ve both got to bat our way. If he gets a hundred ball hundred that for him is the way to go. He should just bat the way he does and not worry about being too aggressive and hopefully I can take a bit of pressure off him at the other end and make it easier for him.’ The pair’s task will be made easier, at least on Friday, by the absence of Mitchell Johnson, who misses the first match of the tri-series with a sore hamstring. But Moeen insisted he is ready for the man who destroyed England in the Ashes. ‘I’m not too fussed who bowls to be honest,’ he said. ‘I’ll face him at some stage probably. He’s a world-class bowler who’s got so much respect and I’ve never faced anyone like that so we will see what happens but I feel like I’m ready to face anybody.’ If he can succeed against Johnson on Valentine’s Day then Moeen really will have arrived as a formidable international performer.","England will face Australia on Friday ahead of next month's World Cup .

Despite Qatar unveiling images of a proposed new street circuit in Lusail, the city that has been named as the venue for the final of the 2022 football World Cup, Ecclestone said: ‘There is a problem. ‘When I did the deal to have a race in Bahrain I shook hands with them – promising not to have another race in the area unless they agreed to it. Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that Qatar's plans to host a Formula One race may never get off the ground . ‘Then Abu Dhabi came along and said they wanted a race. I said I couldn’t help them unless Bahrain agree to let them join the calendar. If they agreed, fine. They did agree. ‘Now Bahrain needs to agree to a race in Qatar. If that can be sorted, fine. If not, we can’t do anything about it.’ Qatar’s plans has the support of the Emir, Sheikh Tamim Ben Hamad Al Thani, and their ambitions are underlined by plans for an all-new circuit in preference to using the Losail circuit that has staged Moto GP for the past decade.

"French former Formula One driver Jean-Pierre Beltoise, who won the Monaco Grand Prix in torrential rain in 1972, died in Senegal on Monday at the age of 77. The French motor sport federation (FFSA) and Le Mans organisers paid tribute to Beltoise, whose Monaco victory was the 17th and last by the now-defunct BRM team, and hailed his prowess on two wheels and four. 'One of the great names in French motor sport has left us,' said Pierre Fillon, president of Le Mans 24 Hours organisers the Automobile Club de l'Ouest. Jean-Pierre Beltoise (right) sits in his Formula One car alongside pop singer Petula Clark in 1968 . Jackie Stewart (pictured centre after the 1969 French Grand Prix) raced with Beltoise . 'Jean-Pierre will forever be remembered as a flamboyant driver who was so proud to fly his country's colours and take part in the revival of French teams in the 60s and 70s.' The Paris-born driver died in Dakar, where he had a holiday home, after suffering a stroke and haemorrhage. He had been in a coma since Friday. Beltoise started out as a motorcycle racer, winning 11 French championships, before switching to sportscar racing and Formula One despite a bad crash in 1964 that seriously injured his left arm. He made his F1 debut with Matra in 1967, although he had finished eighth in the 1966 German Grand Prix at the wheel of a Formula Two car, and stayed with the team until the end of 1971, when he switched to BRM. The Frenchman, who married the sister of fellow F1 driver and compatriot Francois Cevert, left Formula One in 1974 after chalking up eight podium finishes from 84 starts.","Jean-Pierre Beltoise won the Monaco Grand Prix in torrential rain in 1972 .

"Jules Bianchi remains unconscious but breathing unaided following his horror crash at the Japanese Grand Prix in October, his parents have announced in a statement. The Frenchman was left in a coma, suffering a severe head injury after his Marussia left the track and crashed head-on with a recovery tractor which was on hand to clear away the wreckage of Adrian Sutil's Sauber - which had left the track in the same position moments earlier. The incident took place on lap 43 of an action-packed race, against the backdrop of the approaching Typhoon Phanfone and with a red-flag falling earlier in proceedings. Jules Bianchi is breathing unaided, despite still being unconscious, his parents confirmed on Tuesday . Bianchi's car was left crumpled after he smashed into the tractor at Suzuka in October . Bianchi struck the 6,500kg crane at a speed of 126kph in wet conditions at Suzuka . Conditions worsened as the race neared its conclusion and, behind the safety car, Bianchi lost control - with the FIA panel which investigated the incident finding that the 25-year-old 'did not slow sufficiently' when approaching the dangerous area of the circuit. Marussia has since folded amid financial difficulties and Bianchi continues his rehabilitation in his native France, with his parents releasing an update on his condition. 'As we reach the conclusion of a difficult year for our family, we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a further update regarding Jules' medical situation, per our pledge to communicate continued information, when appropriate, to his many fans,' their statement read. 'It was a significant and very comforting step for us to be able to bring Jules home to France last month, to continue his rehabilitation surrounded by his family and friends. This is very important for Jules and also for us. Bianchi's car pictured during a rain-soaked Japanese Grand Prix, before his horror crash . The Marussia team, including Briton Max Chilton (centre), showed their support for Bianchi in Russia . 'Since that time, Jules has received the very best treatment in the Intensive Care Unit of Le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU) and now at the CHU's rehabilitation centre for this kind of trauma. 'Jules' neurological status remains unchanged; he is unconscious but able to breathe unaided. Whilst there is no significant information to report, we take a great deal of comfort from the fact that Jules continues to fight, as we knew he would, and this has enabled the medical professionals caring for him to commence the planned, but very painstaking, programme of rehabilitation therapy. 'As we reflect on the events of the past few months, we would like to acknowledge once again the overwhelming warmth and affection shown towards our son. These continue to be challenging times for our family, but the knowledge that he has touched the lives of so many people all around the world has helped us through. The Marussia team still displayed Bianchi's named above their garage at the Russian Grand Prix in October . 'We would also like to acknowledge the respect and support shown by the media towards our family during this time, for which we are extremely grateful. 'We will continue to provide information when it is possible to do so and our sincere appreciation to everyone who continues to pray for Jules.' The rest of the Formula One field gathered at the start line of the Russian Grand Prix, just a week after Bianchi's crash, to pay tribute to their fellow driver's fight and many continue to post regular support on their personal social media accounts.","Bianchi was left in a coma after horror crash in October .

"The administrator behind Caterham believes they have until the end of January to find a buyer if the team is to have any hope of competing in Formula One this year. Negotiations remain ongoing with three credible candidates, although they have been described as 'annoyingly slow' by Finbarr O'Connell, administrator at London-based company Smith & Williamson. With just four weeks to the first of the three pre-season tests, with Jerez the venue for four days from February 1, and 10 weeks to go ahead of the season-opening grand prix in Australia, time is fast running out. Caterham will be allowed to compete in the 2015 Formula One season should they find a new buyer . O'Connell said: 'We are in talks with a few people who have the wherewithal if they decided to go ahead. 'But it's a tough investment decision. Formula One is so expensive and there is not a line of people queueing to get in. 'There are only a very limited number of parties who can afford to get into it. 'One of those interested is a billionaire who would come into F1 for himself and to promote his products, whilst the other two are in the automotive industry.' Asked whether he remained hopeful a deal could be struck, O'Connell added: 'These people can all do it, and I would like them to move quicker because there is a limited period of time. 'But if you are spending £100million you are not going to buy it and rush in at the end and do a half-baked season for 2015. Caterham are interesting three different parties, but none have so far moved to takeover the team . 'People who are spending that amount of money per season want to do it completely properly. 'However, there is only now a small window of time to do 2015 as well as it can be done. 'My view is we have this month and that's it. It might slip into next month, but only if final details are being resolved.' Caterham went into administration in October and sat out the races in the United States and Brazil before making all 230 staff redundant. A crowdfunding project that raised £2.35m allowed the team to make the grid at the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi towards the end of November and put themselves back in the shop window. With talks still going on between the administrator and potential buyers, creditors for now are playing a patient game whilst they await an outcome.","Caterham went into administration in October and are looking for a buyer .

"Fernando Alonso would be top of the list for Mercedes if Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton fails to agree a new deal with the team beyond this year, according to motorsport director Toto Wolff. Hamilton, who took his second championship in 2014 after winning 11 races, has yet to put pen to paper on a new contract despite both sides talking about their eagerness to stay together. 'There's no hurry, we'll discuss it during the year,' Wolff told Italy's Gazetta dello Sport newspaper in an interview from his vacation in the Austrian ski resort of Kitzbuehel when asked about the talks. Toto Wolff (left) hopes that a new contract can be agreed with Lewis Hamilton (second right) at Mercedes . Wolff believes if a deal is not made, Fernando Alonso (right) would be the best replacement for Hamilton (left) 'I'm an optimist. The priority is to continue with these drivers (Hamilton and Nico Rosberg). Should it not be possible, then Alonso represents the first alternative, then there's (Finland's Valtteri) Bottas.' McLaren said last month that Spaniard Alonso, a double world champion, had signed a multi-year deal in joining them from Ferrari. However, Alonso made little secret of the fact that he was interested in the Mercedes seat and is likely to have exit clauses if McLaren, who are starting a new partnership with Honda after years with Mercedes, under-perform. Wolff has emphasised repeatedly that Mercedes want Hamilton to stay long-term and his words could be seen also as a means of putting pressure on the Briton by suggesting the team have alternatives. The Austrian paid tribute also to Alonso's abilities, saying he was 'dangerous (as a rival) in any car. 'If he has a car that can finish sixth, he will take it to third place,' said Wolff. Alonso has left Ferrari to sign a deal with McLaren, but has previously eyed a seat with Mercedes . He dismissed Honda's poor showing in their first post-season test with the new engine and said it was an electronics issue, rather than anything more serious linked to the power unit, of a kind that all teams had experienced. The Austrian also tipped Mercedes-powered Williams, the team he was with before Mercedes and which employs his wife Susie as a test driver as well as Bottas, as being a main rival in 2015 after they finished third overall last year. 'I put Williams at the top of the list,' he said. 'But I also fear a lot Red Bull. They have won four titles in a row and will use every resource in order to fight again for the title.'","Lewis Hamilton is yet to sign a new contract with Mercedes .

"They got engaged in February after five years of dating and it appears as if Jenson Button has married Jessica Micibata just before  2014 comes to an end. The Formula One ace and the beautiful model have been enjoying a luxurious holiday in Maui, Hawaii over the festive period and Jessica, 30, hinted they had tied the knot when she posted a picture to Instagram of herself in a beautiful white dress on Christmas Eve.

Twitter user @AlohaMinamii wrote :'@jessybondgirl hope you guys going to have a fabulous wedding on Maui!' The couple confirmed their engagement in February after Jessica was pictured in the paddock during day three of Formula One Winter Testing at the Bahrain International Circuit weariing a huge diamond ring. A spokesperson for Jenson, 34, formally confirmed the news and declared that the couple were 'delighted'. Jessica and Jenson have been soaking up the sunshine on the beautiful island of Maui . Congratulations: Many fans took to Twitter to congratulate the couple on their reported wedding . The Japanese model first met Jenson in 2008 in a hotel bar in Tokyo and originally perceived him to be something of a womaniser, turning him down when he first asked her out. Eight months later she finally gave in to his pursuits and the pair started dating. Jenson was at the lowest point in his career after finishing 18th in the championship and being dropped by sponsor Honda, but that didn't stop their relationship going from strength to strength. But it wasn't until Jenson became Formula One World Champion in Brazil in 2009 that Jessica realised just how strong his love for her was, when he dedicated his win to her, live on television. The pair split in 2011, but spoke constantly during their time apart and decided to give their relationship another go six months later. Of Jessica's stunning engagement ring, Vashi Dominguez, CEO and founder of diamond jewellery specialist Vashi.com told MailOnline: 'This is a stunning engagement ring but a brave choice if Jenson selected it himself. 'It looks to be a pear shaped five carat diamond three stone engagement ring set in platinum and we would estimate the cost would be in excess of £250,000.' Rocky start: The Japanese model first met Jenson in 2008 in a hotel bar in Tokyo and originally perceived him to be something of a womaniser, turning him down when he first asked her out . He added: 'As the ring is so unusual, we suspect it might be an occasional piece for show rather than being worn every day, as for someone as sporty and active as Jessica the shape and weight is not very practical. 'It is not unusual for couples to invest in a second, more practical ring when a large stone such as this is purchased, so we may well see Jessica occasionally wearing a more traditional round cut solitaire when in need of something for everyday wear.' News of Jenson's engagement was some welcome happy tidings shortly after the sudden death of Jenson's father, John Button, who died in January aged 70. John passed away from a heart attack at his home on the French Riviera. He was an extremely popular and ever-present figure in the grand prix paddock, and missed only one of his son's 247 Grands Prix starts. The ultimate reward for the father-son duo came in 2009 when Jenson, who started the campaign as an underdog, was crowned world champion. When Mr Button split from his wife Simone (Jenson's mother), Jenson moved in with his father but remained close to his mother and older sisters, Natasha, Samantha and Tanya.

"Nathan Cleverly will put his body through hell as he plans one final assault on a world title after deciding to move back down to light heavyweight. The Welshman will return to the division that saw him reign as world champion for three years after his defeat to bitter rival Tony Bellew last November. Cleverly will be back in the ring on April 11 in Leeds before targeting a shot at WBA regular champion Jurgen Braehmer. Nathan Cleverly will return to light heavyweight following his defeat to Tony Bellew last November . 'It was very soon after the fight that I made the decision to move back down,' he told Sportsmail. 'It was obvious to me from the fight; in the last six rounds I felt sluggish and just sapped of energy. 'It was definitely the weight that was slowing me down. 'It was a calculated gamble moving up to cruiserweight and I'm not quite big enough for the division so the only option is to move back down to light heavyweight and hopefully get back to my best.' Cleverly said he felt sluggish in the second half of the fight as Bellew won by split decision . Cleverly, who lost his WBO crown to Sergey Kovalev in 2013 before winning his first two fights at cruiserweight, insisted he gave only the briefest of thoughts to retiring. 'In the aftermath of fights, you sometimes have a few moments when you reflect on whether you've got it anymore,' he said. 'But then you go away and have some time out of boxing and find your true self. I'm a fighter and I love the buzz of boxing. 'It gives me ambition and passion and I just can't let it go; I need to get that world title back in my life.' Cleverly (left) said he only considered retiring for the briefest of moments after the fight . But Cleverly admitted the process of stripping away the 25lb he had added to his frame will be far from simple. 'In an ideal world there would be a weight between light heavyweight and cruiserweight but there's not,' he added. 'It's going to be very difficult. I'm a little bit bigger now and I've got to strip away a bit of muscle. 'My body fat has got to be exceptionally low and my diet has got to change. It's got to be specific to losing weight while maintaining high energy levels. Cleverly is ready for tough challenge of losing the extra weight gained when he moved up a division . 'It's going to be very, very tough and I'm under no illusions but it's something all top fighters have to deal with.' Cleverly will bring in a nutritionist but plans to remain under the tutelage of trainer Darren Wilson. And after his tune-up in Leeds, he wants a shot at Braehmer, who he was scheduled to fight in 2010 before the German pulled out. Cleverly has his sights set on a fight against WBA regular champion Jurgen Braehmer after the April 11 bout . 'Braehmer is the target,' Cleverly said. 'The promoters have talked and it looks like we can make it happen. 'We've got a lot of history and hopefully we can get the fight on. 'You could say it's my last chance because if I can't grab a world title now, then where do I go?
