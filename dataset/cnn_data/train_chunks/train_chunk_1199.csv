"A disgruntled paramedic trainee, who didn't pass a psychometric test, set alight an ambulance station and two vans causing $6 million in damage as a blatant act of revenge, a court has heard. Jodie La Spina pleaded guilty to two counts of arson and unlawful use of a motor vehicle after being found by emergency services workers at the scene on October 26, 2010 in Cleveland - about 25km southeast of Brisbane. Despite receiving a three-year sentence at the Brisbane District Court on Tuesday, the 27-year-old will be released on three years' probation on Friday after already spending more than four years behind bars - including 20 months in a mental health facility, The Courier Mail reported. Jodie La Spina pleaded guilty to two counts of arson and unlawful use of a motor vehicle . La Spina received a three-year sentence at the Brisbane District Court on Tuesday . But she will be released on three years' probation on Friday after spending more than four years behind bars - including 20 months in a mental health facility . La Spina purchased a lighter from a service station and jemmied open a door at the Cleveland Ambulance Station before taking the keys to one of the two vans inside the building which she set alight with accelerant ethanol, the court heard. She then drove the ambulance to her bike and set fire to the van. Crown prosecutor Maita Aylward said La Spina made threats to burn down another ambulance while being transported as a patient three months earlier. Ms Aylward told the court that she said to the officers: 'Ambulance van 292 was ""a shitbox"" and she was going to burn it down'. Ms Aylward said La Spina 'staged the scene' by laying her motorcycle down to concoct a story that the ambulance driver knocked over her bike. La Spina threatened to burn down another ambulance while being transported as a patient three months earlier . She told the officers that ambulance van 292 was ""a shitbox"" and she was going to 'burn it down' She also changed her stories twice and then said she could not recall anything from that night. Ms Aylward said La Spina's motive was revenge because her Queensland Ambulance Service was rejected due failing a psychometric test. Marty Barrett, who lives across the road from the station, told Daily Mail Australia, that he still recalls the 2010 blast like it was yesterday. 'I was laying in bed when I heard weird noises so I went outside and thought I would try to rescue the ambulances but gas started exploding and I knew it wasn't worth risking my life for,' he said. Mr Barrett couldn't comprehend the deliberate arson attack. 'The service only does good so why would someone want to do damage to it? It's unnatural.' The Cleveland Ambulance Station reopened just a few months ago after the 2014 arson attack . The rebuild of the new ambulance station cost more than $2million .","Jodie La Spina set alight Cleveland Ambulance Station and two vans in Cleveland, Queensland in 2010 .

"The phones were ringing off the hook at Gordy's Pizza & Pasta in Port Angeles last Wednesday, but the callers weren't looking for the eatery's signature fettuccine. They were trying to vote for their favorite singing contestants on the hit Fox TV show American Idol. The Peninsula Daily News reports that it's not clear why the calls were routed to Gordy's for two hours Wednesday night. The number the show advertised for voters - 855-443-6411 - is not similar to the number the pizzeria has had for the past 50 years. Popular pizza: Randy Sexton, owner of Gordy's Pizza & Pasta in Port Angeles, Washington says his eatery was inundated with calls last Wednesday night from people trying to vote for their favorite contestants on American Idol . According to the show, viewers nationwide cast more than 71 million votes Wednesday night. The restaurant's owner, Randy Sexton, said his staff was inundated with calls - 'a frenzy of ring, ring, ring, ring, ring' - and answered every one as if it were a customer. He hopes the snafu gets fixed before next Wednesday's episode. A spokeswoman for 'American Idol,' now in its 13th season said efforts were being made to fix the problem. Remains a mystery: The little pizza shop has had the same phone number for 50 years. Now Sexton is forced to wonder if he has three more months of American Idol nights to deal with. Wednesday's debacle had him and his employees scrambling to properly serve the calls that were actually customers . Sexton said a mistake may have been made - possibly a keyboard typo - when voters' calls were routed through AT&T. Most of the calls seemed to be from the East Coast, he said. Sandy Bennett, who set up and manages the show's voting system, did not have an explanation, according to an email she sent to Wave Broadband in an effort to address the problem. Bennett is the general manager of Los Angeles-based Telescope, 'a provider of audience participation, consumer engagement and social television solutions,' according to its website. She suggested blocking out-of-state calls to Gordy's during show nights, subject to Sexton's approval. 'The purpose of this is to prevent the misdials/routed calls from flooding Mr. Sexton's lines and interrupting his business while we continue to work on investigating the cause,' Bennett said. Bennett also suggested placing a trap on the line to detect the number that 'American Idol' voters are actually dialing. 'While they say they are calling 855-443-6411, it's quite possible it's something similar and is somehow tied to the pizza company,' Bennett wrote. Sexton was not happy about the prospect of another night of frenzied phone calls from 'American Idol' fans. The show has 12 episodes remaining this season. 'I have three months of potential challenge if they don't figure out how to reroute or unroute calls in a different way,' he said.","The owner of Gordy's Pizza in Port Angeles, WA Randy Sexton, says the phones rang off the hook during last Wednesday's American Idol voting .

"In the home of the future, the front door will ‘talk’ to your smoke alarm, lights will flash when the fridge door is left open and a teddy will put your child to bed. That’s the vision presented by Qualcomm at this year’s Mobile World Congress in its Connected Home, which shows how almost anything in your house can either be controlled by a mobile, or be linked together electronically. Other features include the August smart lock that unlocks the front door when the home owner is near, smart TVs that show notifications and can warn when a child is using the web when they should be asleep and a system that lets you change all the clocks in your home at the touch of a button. Scroll down for video . Californian company Qualcomm demonstrated that technology to create smart houses of the future already exists and can be linked up for intelligent living . LiFx lights (x10) = £530 ($890) August smart lock = £119 ($199) – available from Spring . Elertus sensor = £119 ($199) Canary smart alarm = £119 ($199) – available from July . Nest smoke alarm = £77 ($129) Smart TV = from around £329 ($548) Teddy The Guardian = £139 ($232) Jalousier smart blinds = £77 ($129) Total = £1,509 ($2,519) All the products in Qualcomm’s concept three-roomed house are sold by individual companies, or have been developed by the California-based firm, but they all run the AllJoyn software. AllJoyn is an open source project set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011. It is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn. The company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further. The . August smart lock (pictured) secures Qualcomm's smart house. Fitted to the existing door lock, the battery-powered . device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the August . app. It can be connected to smart lights that flash when the door is opened . To open the lock (pictured left), anyone with a code can . approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant . address from the app (pictured right) It works by letting users set triggers for events. For example, if someone opens the fridge door this triggers an event, such as making smart lights flash, or an alarm to sound. At the front of Qualcomm’s house was the August smart lock. Fitted to the existing door lock, the battery-powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the August app. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app. The lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired Bluetooth device. It then confirms the visitor's identity. Qualcomm's Connected Home shows how almost anything in your house can either be controlled by a mobile, or be linked together. A TV that shows notifications,, smart lighting and a wine cooler with sensors is pictured in the futuristic kitchen . This interactive image shows what sort of hi-tech devices could be used in your living room - and other rooms in a house of the future . A circle of red dots on the front of the device will turn green and the August lock will twist to release the lock and open the door. To grant key-less access to friends the homeowner must send them an invite using Facebook contacts or their phone's address book. A smart security alarm, such as Canary (pictured) can be connected to smart lights from LiFx . Here, LiFx lights flash to silently alert homeowners to the fact there is . an intruder in their home . When someone enters or leaves the house a notification is sent to the owner and the lock automatically closes after 10 seconds to secure the door. The August device will be available from Spring for £119 ($199). Using AllJoyn, this lock can then be connected to a smart smoke or security alarm, such as Nest. When the alarm detects smoke, it triggers an event that is picked up by the lock. The lock then automatically opens to let people leave the house in a fire quickly. Elsewhere, a smart security alarm, such as Canary, can be connected to smart lights from LiFx. The lights could then flash in the bedroom, for example, to silently alert homeowners to the fact there is an intruder downstairs. Canary will be available from July and costs £119 ($199). The system can also be used for people with poor hearing. The smart LiFx lights in Qualcomm’s . demonstration (pictured left) were funded by a Kickstarter campaign. They start at $89 . (£53) each and an individual light can be customised to be any colour on . the spectrum using an app (right) Canary has a built-in HD video camera with night vision, microphone speakers to track changes in sound, temperature, air and humidity sensors, passive infrared motion detectors and a siren. The privacy settings can also be customised. For example, Canary can be 'armed' at certain times of the day or week. The smart LiFx lights in Qualcomm’s demonstration were funded by a Kickstarter campaign. They start at $89 (£53) each and an individual light can be customised to be any colour on the spectrum. This colour, and the light’s brightness can then be controlled remotely using an app. For example, the lights could be turned pink for a girl’s bedroom or blue for a boy. Qualcomm used the LiFx lights because they can be connected to any smart device running AllJoyn. For example, in the kitchen of Qualcomm’s Connected Home the LiFx lights were linked to a smart wine cooler fitted with an Elertus sensor, starting at £119 ($199). Elertus sensors can be fitted to almost . any item in the house to detect changes in movement or temperature, for . example. A home owner can keep tabs on alerts using an app (left). In the Wine Protection System (right) the sensor recognises when the . wine cooler has been opened . Here, sensors alert the home owner that someone has opened the wine cooler in the kitchen . Elertus sensors can be fitted to almost any item in the house to detect changes in movement or temperature, for example. In the Wine Protection System the sensor recognises when the wine cooler has been opened. In the Connected Home demonstration, when the door was left open for more than five seconds, the LiFx lights changed colour, and flashed – and these different triggers and events can be customised to make the wait shorter, or change the sequence of flashes. This Elertus sensor can also be fitted to a fridge or freezer door, or a cookie jar for dieters. Another use for the sensor is to send warnings and notifications to smart TVs. In Qualcomm’s home a message was displayed in the corner of all TVs in the house when the wine cooler was opened. Notifications were also sent when someone was at the door, via the August lock, or when someone in another room accessed the internet. Child's bedroom of the future. A network of devices, lights, clocks and even a smart teddy bear are connected to help a child wake up, or go to sleep . An example of this was demonstrated in the child’s bedroom of the mock-up house. If a parent puts a child to bed, but the child starts watching YouTube on a phone, or starts playing a games console, a smart router alerts the parents, via a TV notification in another room that their child is still awake. The parents can then remotely shut off internet access to that room only. Elsewhere in the child’s bedroom, a network of devices, lights, clocks and even a smart teddy bear were connected to help a child wake up, or go to sleep. Qualcomm demonstrated that at the touch of a button, an alarm clock can start ringing, the smart lights can slowly brighten and a teddy can say ‘good morning’ to the child. The teddy used in the home was a concept device (pictured) that can speak to children to wake them up, yet similar smart teddies are already on sale, such as Teddy the Guardian from London-based IDX Labs . This can be reversed when it’s time to put the child to bed, and the teddy will instead say ‘goodnight. 'The teddy used in the home was a concept device, yet similar smart teddies are already on sale, such as Teddy the Guardian from London-based IDX Labs. By connecting smart clocks to the connected home, users could also reset the time in the spring and autumn, for daylight savings time in the UK, all at once. Alternatively, if there’s a power cut, users can set all their smart clocks simultaneously. Other examples seen in Qualcomm’s Connected Home tour included music systems in which different speakers were set at different volume levels and remotely-controlled air conditioning units that can also automatically adjust to temperature changes. This could all be used with Jalouiser’s smart blinds.","Qualcomm showed off its vision of the Connected Home at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

"Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart has slammed her estranged children after she lost a bid to keep secret details of a family stoush over a $5billion trust fund. In the latest development embroiling the Rinehart family, John Hancock and his sister, Bianca, have launched Federal Court proceedings against their mother's company, Hancock Prospecting. Ms Rinehart and her company had sought to extend an interim suppression order on the full details of their claim, saying if aired there was a 'real risk of commercial harm' to mining projects such as the multibillion-dollar Roy Hill. Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart has slammed her estranged children after she lost a bid to keep secret details of a family stoush over a $5 billion trust fund . The project in Western Australia's Pilbara region is to start exporting next year. But Justice Peter Jacobson rejected her application on Wednesday, saying the substance of the allegations were already in the public domain and there was a public interest in open justice. After the decision was handed down, Ms Rinehart's spokesman released a statement on her behalf calling her children spoiled rich kids. 'I feel parents everywhere cringe at this scene, watching extremely privileged children suing to get even more money unearned by them, after their mother's lifetime of hard work,' the spokesman said. Her son and daughter Bianca (pictured) have launched Federal Court proceedings against their mother's company, Hancock Prospecting . When handing down his ruling, Justice Jacobson described the battle as the 'latest iteration of a bitter and long-running dispute' between Ms Rinehart and her two children into her administration of the $5 billion family trust, of which they are beneficiaries. Like the ongoing Supreme Court proceedings between the children and their mother, Justice Jacobson said the dispute includes allegations of serious breaches of fiduciary duty by the mining magnate in her capacity as trustee. But now, the children are also seeking profits and are hoping to set aside the so-called Hope Downs Deed due to allegations of misleading conduct by Ms Rinehart and her company. John Hancock (pictured left) has sided with his sister as well in the family fight . The Hope Down Deed contains, among other things, an agreement to refer disputes under this deed to confidential arbitration. In his decision, Justice Jacobson dismissed Ms Rinehart's claim that her two children were using the proceedings for a purpose 'tantamount to blackmail', by using publicity to put pressure on her. He said much of the 'long and sorry history of this litigation' was already in the public domain and that the public interest in open justice must be taken into account.","Bid involves Gina Rinehart's children, John Hancock and Bianca Rinehart .

"June Steenkamp (pictured) says an apology from Pistorius is 'not enough' but she hopes to one day ask him to his face why he killed her daughter Reeva . June Steenkamp has revealed she and her husband are willing to one day meet Oscar Pistorius and ask him face to face why he shot dead their daughter. The couple have never actually met Pistorius, who was last month jailed for five years for killing their daughter Reeva, but Mrs Steenkamp is steeling herself for the inevitable day they finally meet and have the opportunity to ask him why he pulled the trigger. During his trial, Pistorius stood before the court and issued a tearful public apology to the Steenkamps - an act she said she was completely unmoved by - and he has also made a request to meet them in person. But this request came too soon after the harrowing ordeal of losing their daughter and at that time they were not yet ready to speak to him. 'What can he say? Sorry is not enough,' she told the Guardian. 'What can he say and what would we want to talk to him about? I don't know. 'But one day that confrontation will come. Altercation? Maybe. Violence? No, I don't think so. But that day has to come.' Following a seven month trial, on October 21 Pistorius was acquitted of murder and found guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide in a ruling and interpretation of the law which was heavily criticised for being too lenient. Under the current terms, the Paralympian is eligible for release after 10 months and would then complete his sentence under house arrest. Mrs Steenkamp's belief that she and her husband will one day meet with Pistorius follows her claims her daughter never had sex with him during their three-month relationship and was about to leave the disgraced athlete on the night he shot her dead. Pistorius previously told his murder trial that the couple were planning a life together, but she said she has 'no doubt in her mind' that her daughter wanted to end their romance and believed it was only a matter of time before he killed somebody. She also said the model refused to sleep with the Paralympian because she had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility', the Times Magazine reported. In Judge Masipa's judgment explaining why she could only convict Pistorius on culpable homicide, or manslaughter, the 67 year-old judge acknowledged that a 'reasonable' person with Pistorius's disabilities would have foreseen that shooting into the door may have killed the person inside. June  and Barry Steenkamp (pictured) are steeling themselves for the day they meet Pistorius face to face . Left, Mrs Steenkamp pictured listening to evidence in court during the Pistorius trial, and right, her daughter Reeva Steenkamp, who Pistorius said he mistook for a burglar when he shot her through a bathroom door . However, she said South African legal precedents warned against automatically assuming that because a perpetrator 'should have' foreseen the consequences of his actions that he actually did. She said that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the double amputee foresaw the fatal consequences of his actions when he shot at the door, meaning she could not convict him on a murder charge. But South African prosecutors have confirmed they will appeal the manslaughter verdict and five-year prison sentence after failing to secure the murder conviction. Prosecution spokesman Nathi Mncube said the next step would be to file papers in court. June and Barry Steenkamp (pictured) sat through often graphic and bloody forensic evidence detailing the killing of their daughter . Reeva Steenkamp pictured with Pistorius in early 2013. The two had been seeing each other for three months before the shooting . It came amid reports the runner had spent £1million in legal fees during the trial - with nearly half that amount still unpaid - raising questions how the athlete would fund a second defence. Last week, prosecutors admitted they had 'an appetite' for an appeal, with chief lawyer Gerrie Nel holding urgent meetings with the country's most senior legal experts to build a case. Professor James Grant, who was one of the first to be consulted, said it would not be straightforward process. The high-profile nature of the Blade Runner’s trial had raised questionable legal precedents that academics argued against for years, he added. A ruling on a case heard before South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal more than 30 years ago set a precedent that now limits the state’s right of appeal. In order for the verdict in Pistorius's case to be challenged, the earlier case would also have to be appealed.","June Steenkamp says she is prepared to meet Oscar Pistorius face to face .

"Bristol's Peter Nunn denies sending abusive messages to a Labour MP after she supported a campaign to have Jane Austen on banknotes . A twitter troll bombarded a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to feature Jane Austen on £10 notes, a court heard yesterday. Peter Nunn, 33, is said to have passed on the ‘menacing’ messages threatening to rape Stella Creasy and calling her an ‘evil witch’. Miss Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, was deluged with offensive messages after she backed a high-profile social media  campaign to ensure a female face would remain on banknotes. The court heard Nunn both retweeted and composed messages in which  campaigners were threatened. Feminist Caroline Criado-Perez launched the Austen campaign in July after the Bank of England replaced social activist Elizabeth Fry with Sir Winston Churchill on £5 notes. The Bank then announced the Pride And Prejudice author would replace Charles Darwin on the £10 note. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court Nunn ‘embarked on a campaign of hatred in various different forms towards both women’. He is said to have posted messages from two separate Twitter accounts and retweeted a message sent to Miss Creasy which read: ‘You better watch your back, I’m going to rape your **** at 8pm and put the video all over.’ Miss Morgan said: ‘It is not alleged that he created the text and the threat, but for whatever reason he chose to retweet it and it is a message that is menacing in character.’ Nunn, it is said, then sent other offensive messages to the MP. He allegedly wrote: ‘If you can’t threaten to rape a celebrity, what is the point in having them?’ The court heard Nunn targeted Labour MP Stella Creasy (left) after she backed a campaign to have a woman on the £10 note launched by Caroline Criado-Perez (right) After he was banned from Twitter, he . is accused of creating another account and writing: ‘I’m here again to . tell you that I’ll rape you tomorrow at 6pm.’ The . court heard that Nunn, a self-styled blogger from Bristol, also left . offensive posts in which he called the campaigners witches. Miss . Morgan told the court that while the entries do not form part of the . criminal charge, they show the ‘hatred’ he had for the women. She said: ‘They demonstrate the state of mind of the defendant at the time at which he was sending the reported tweets.’ Nunn . defended his action in a series of video diaries, saying: ‘It’s . entirely ridiculous – an MP and someone else got a few messages saying . “I’m going to rape you”. I’ve had it before, you can’t go to the police . they’ve enough to do. They’re looking for murderers and proper rapists.’ When Nunn was arrested he admitted he had retweeted  messages that were violent, but said he did so ‘to further debate’. He . denies sending a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, . obscene or menacing character by a public electronic network. The charge . carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison. The case was adjourned for reports until September. The campaign to get writer Jane Austen on banknotes was a success, but both women suffered a barrage of hate as a response to their support for it .

"Nicolas Sarkozy received up to £42million from Colonel Gaddafi to fund his election as president, it was claimed yesterday. Evidence made public in Paris is said to prove that the two men had an   illegal financial arrangement that  helped Mr Sarkozy to power in 2007. A governmental briefing note published by Mediapart, an investigative website, points to numerous visits to Libya by Mr Sarkozy and his colleagues that were aimed at securing funding. Anger: Nicolas Sarkozy (left) lashed out at a journalist on live television after she raised allegations about him receiving £42million from Colonel Gaddafi (right) One, which is referred to in the note . as having taken place on October 6, 2005, led to ‘campaign finance to . NS (Nicolas Sarkozy)’ being ‘totally solved’. At . the time Mr Sarkozy was an ambitious interior minister raising money . for his presidential election campaign. Taking cash would have broken . political financing laws. Mediapart claims that 50million euros referred to in the note was laundered through bank accounts in Panama and Switzerland. Close: Extraordinary evidence made public in Paris is said to prove that the two former close allies had an illegal financial arrangement which propelled Mr Sarkozy to power in 2007 . The Swiss account was opened in the name of the sister of Jean-Francois Cope, the leader of Mr Sarkozy’s ruling UMP party, and the president’s right-hand-man. The money was then allegedly distributed through an arms dealer called Ziad Takieddine, who acted as a middle man between Arab despots and French politicians. Gaddafi’s son and former heir, Saif, last year stated unambiguously that Libya had financed Mr Sarkozy. Saif, who was arrested after the fall of his father’s regime, said: ‘Sarkozy must first give back the money he took from Libya to finance his electoral campaign. We funded it. ‘We have all the details and are ready to reveal everything. Betrayal: But ultimately Nicolas Sarkozy (left) turned on Colonel Gaddafi (right) as French jets were the first to attack Libya . ‘The first thing we want this clown to do is to give the money back to the Libyan people. He was given the assistance so he could help them, but he has disappointed us. Give us back our money.’ In December 2007, eyebrows were raised when Colonel Gaddafi was honoured with a state visit to Paris. Revelations: Gaddafi's son Saif-Al Islam said last year that Libya had financed Mr Sarkozy's election but did not say what the figure was . He was referred to as the ‘Brother Leader’ by the French, and allowed to pitch his Bedouin tent next to the Elysee Palace. The incriminating evidence came in a thorough investigation of Takieddine’s activities. His doctor, Didier Grosskopf, told judges in Paris that he went on many of the trips to Libya and witnessed negotiations about political funding. The discussions involved Brice Hortefeux, one of Mr Sarkozy’s closest allies, who has confirmed to Mediapart the meetings took place, but would not comment further, beyond denying any wrongdoing. The incriminating note, which is in the hands of the French police, was leaked to Mediapart along with other documents. These include at least three letters sent from Mr Sarkozy and his colleagues to the Libyan leader in 2005 and details of ‘one-on-one negotiations’ between Mr Sarkozy and Gaddafi. ‘If these allegations are proved then those involved face prison sentences,’ said political analyst Yves Thibier. ‘There are frequent funding scandals involving domestic donors, but a Gaddafi funding scandal is something else.’ The Elysee Palace made no comment.",Not that it stopped him being at forefront of military campaign to hound Libyan dictator to his death .
"The mayor of Washington D.C. is demanding that the city’s major football team, the Washington Redskins, change its name as it is offensive to Native Americans. Mayor Vincent Gray said if the team wants to move from its current playing field outside the capital inside the borders of the District of Columbia they need to consider a new moniker. The word ‘redskin’ is considered a racial slur against Native Americans and the name has seen the football team face decades of legal battles. Calling for change: Mayor Vincent Gray said if the team wishes to move within the borders of Washington DC they need to 'do the right thing' and remove Redskins from their name . ‘I think that if they get serious with . the team coming back to Washington, there's no doubt there's going to . have to be a discussion about that,'' he told a news conference on Wednesday. ‘I think it has become a lightning rod, and I would love to be able to sit down with the team and see if a change should be made.' Mr Gray added: There's a precedent for this, and I think there needs to be a dispassionate discussion about this, and do the right thing.’ Mr Gray referred to the case of the city’s Washington Bullets basketball team which changed it's name to Washington Wizards in 1995 due to the high homicide and crime rate in the city at the time.

A legal case against the club’s name was filed in 1992 by a group of Native Americans headed by Dr Susan Shown Harjo, founder of the National Museum of the American Indian. Although lower courts held up that the word ‘redskin’ was an offensive term towards Native Americans the case was thrown out by the Supreme court in 2009. ‘The term ‘redskins’ is the most vile and offensive term used to describe Native Americans,’ Dr Harjo told the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011. ‘It is most disturbing to the overwhelming majority of Native Americans throughout the country that the professional football team in the nation’s capital uses a team name that demeans us.’ The Washington Redskins currently play at the FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, a contract which runs out in 2026. The Washington Redskins is an National Football League team based in Washington D.C. The Redskins have won five NFL Championships, three Super Bowls and two pre-merger. Washington Redskins was founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves in Boston, Massachusetts. The team’s name changed the following year when it moved to share the home field with the Boston Red Sox and became Boston Redskins, and has been the Washington Redskins since its move to D.C. in 1937. The team played at the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in DC until 1997 when the move to the current FedEx Fields in Landover, Maryland. The team is ranked as the second most valuable in the NFL by Forbes Magazine, and was the highest grossing team during the 2009 season with $345 million in revenue.","Washington DC mayor Vincent Gray urge Redskins to 'do the right thing'

"A gay couple who have tied the knot in France's first same-sex marriage said they were 'honoured to be a symbol for the country' as they wed under strict security and tight police surveillance. Vincent Autin, 40, and Bruno Boileau, 30, became the nation's first gay couple to get married this afternoon, just days after their country legalised same-sex marriage. They married in the southern French city of Montpellier, in a ceremony held under tight police surveillance - a stark reminder of the months of bruising opposition to the French gay marriage law that was passed earlier this month. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The couple said they were 'honoured to become a symbol for the nation'. France is the 14th country to legalise same-sex marriage, an issue that has also divided opinion in many other nations .

They became the nation's first gay couple to get married this afternoon, just days after their country legalised same-sex marriage . They married in the southern French city of Montpellier, in a ceremony held under tight police surveillance . Ahead of the ceremony,  groom Mr Boileau said he would not let the protests spoil his and his partner's day . Last Sunday, thousands of people protested fiercely in Paris against the new gay marriage law. The demonstrations ended with riot police shooting tear gas. Ahead of the ceremony,  groom Mr Boileau said he would not let the protests spoil his and his partner's day. He said: 'It's still our wedding, whatever happens. 'There always are security rules that we have to follow, but we want to walk across the city hall square. We want to dedicate this moment to all those who fought against hatred over the past months.' The couple yesterday addressed a press conference surrounded by family and friends. Vincent Autin and his partner Bruno Boileau, speaking to a press conference, say they are proud to 'send a positive message to the whole world' An anti-gay marriage demonstrator lifts a flair as he faces riot police smoke during clashes in Paris, on Sunday. Hundreds of protesters clashed with police . The French gay marriage law was passed earlier this month . Mr Boileau said: 'Obviously we are honoured because as we said it is a symbol for the country, it is a big step that France is taking, so we are honoured by this', The Telegraph reports. Helene Mandroux, the mayor of Montpellier, a city with a large and vibrant gay community, will lead the wedding ceremony in the city council. She said the marriage was about one simple message: the 'same rights for everybody.' 'Today, men and women in France will no longer be discriminated against when it comes to their sexual orientation,' she added. Plan to legalize same-sex marriage and allow gay couples to adopt was a liberal cornerstone of Socialist President Francois Hollande's election manifesto last year. It initially looked like a shoo-in for Hollande, since the measures were supported by a majority of the country, and an easy way to break with his conservative predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. But the issue became a touchstone as Hollande's popularity has sunk to unprecedented lows, largely over France's ailing economy. A political hot potato, it exposed bitter divisions between urban France, where homosexuality is widely accepted, and the Catholic heartland, where conservative attitudes hold sway.

"She's won a Grammy, has been handpicked by Pharrell to join him on tour and is set to feature in an upcoming episode of the eighth series of Doctor Who - is 2014 the year of Foxes? And the singer, who won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, is celebrating yet another coup - landing a major campaign with adidas. With her musical success and cool urban style, adidas was keen to snap her up to launch its latest running footwear, the Energy BOOST. Scroll down for video . Singer turned model: Pop starlet Foxes, real name Louisa Allen, is helping to launch adidas' latest running footwear, the adidas Energy BOOST . The sportswear giant wanted the campaign to unite her unique style and passion for fitness - and as the new imagery proves, she's the perfect postergirl for the sporty brand. Speaking about her latest feat, the singer, real name Louisa Allen, said: 'I've always loved adidas and I started wearing their stuff last year all the time and it got to the stage where I thought: ""it's ridiculous that I'm not doing a campaign with them"". I love their jackets they're just so easy to wear.' The 25-year-old from Southampton is definitely on trend. Sportsluxe, which was seen on pretty much every AW14 catwalk, shows no sign of abating and luckily for Foxes, she's always championed the style. 'I love the whole sexy sportswear vibe,' she said. 'I always loved what Sporty Spice wore and the way she dressed. I am particularly keen on the boost range, it feels like running on clouds, which is great for on tour when I'm trying to keep fit.' Fighting fit: While she often struggles to find the time to work out due to a hectic schedule, she loves running around London Fields with her friends . Health kick: Foxes has a friend who is amazing at juice making, which is great, she says, because it is really important to be super healthy on tour . While she showcases an impressively honed physique in the new campaign imagery, Foxes says she struggles to maintain an active lifestyle. 'It is quite hard to keep my fitness up because I am so busy,' she said. 'The best time for me to work on my fitness is when I am on tour because that way I am able to explore different cities by running around them. 'I'm quite lucky that I have a friend who is quite into fitness so she is always putting the whip on me. She is also amazing at juice making, which is great because it is really important to be super healthy on tour. 'I'm not ridiculously into the whole clean and lean eating. I had a shot of ginger this morning and that was just weird.' Foxes says she isn't that keen on hitting the gym and prefers running around London Fields with her friends. In fashion: Foxes says she has always loved the whole sexy sportswear vibe, which is very on trend this season . Following the release of the single Beauty Queen in May 2013, Debenhams used in its advertising campaign and her next single, Youth, reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

Speaking about her promising career, she said: 'This year has been a whirlwind, it's so crazy. I couldn't believe it when I won the Grammy. I still can't believe it, I mean there's a golden megaphone in my room for God's sake. It has been so hectic it hasn't stopped.' While she can't believe her luck, an industry heavyweight is championing her talent. 'Pharrell heard my cover of Happy in the Radio One Live Lounge and invited me to perform on his European tour, which I'm really excited about. I've always followed his career and I really like the message he's putting out at the moment.' And her luck doesn't stop there. 'I wrote a song for Doctor Who,' she revealed. 'I've always been a fan and so has my Grandma. We were stood outside a Doctor Who conference and we got talking and they called me up and asked me if I wanted to be on the show and I said I'd love to. 'I've never done any acting before but I've always been interested in it.

"Britain was left out in the cold . yesterday as EU leaders signed  a controversial treaty which  critics . say could herald the dawn of a two-tier Europe. Furious Tory MPs last night argued . Britain would be pushed to the margins of European decision-making and . renewed their calls for a referendum on whether we should now leave the . EU. German Chancellor Angela Merkel . described the new Fiscal Compact – a desperate attempt to save the . single currency – as a ‘great leap’ and a ‘milestone’ towards stability . and political union. Closer than ever: French President Nicolas Sarkozy, right, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday . Under the treaty,  eurozone countries . will scrutinise each other’s budgets and the European Court of Justice . will be able to fine them if they fail to stick to the rules. But the new treaty’s credibility was . already under threat last night after both Spain and the Netherlands . admitted they will miss targets for reducing their deficits. Britain and the Czech republic were . the only two EU countries who refused to sign the agreement during a 15 . minute ceremony in Brussels yesterday. Bitter pill to swallow: But Prime Minister David Cameron insisted Britain's voice had been heard at the EU . The event was presided over by  Herman Van Rompuy, who had earlier been re-appointed unopposed as European President. David Cameron vetoed plans to change the EU treaties to enforce greater budgetary discipline during a summit in December. European President Herman Van Rompuy has been handed another two years in power without an election. Mr Van Rompuy, 64, who had no rivals for the post, received the backing of all EU leaders including David Cameron. The Belgian politician will remain as European Council supremo until 2014. Mr Van Rompuy was virtually unknown on the world stage when he was appointed as the council’s first president in 2009. Since then, he has presided over the Eurozone crisis. The Belgian enjoys a £250,000 salary which is almost double that of Mr Cameron. He triggered outrage on the eve of his second term this week by claiming national parliaments are now EU institutions. He said: ‘Decisions by one national parliament – be it in Germany or Ireland, in Slovakia or Portugal – are watched all over Europe. ‘Maybe not formally speaking, but at least politically speaking, all national parliaments have become, in a way, European institutions.’ The Treaty for Stability, . Co-ordination and Governance was drawn up to prevent the 17 eurozone . states running up  huge debts like those which sparked the Greek, Irish . and Portuguese bailouts. But Tory MP Bill Cash said: ‘We now . have two Europes, both built on sand. It is essential that we have a . referendum in this country so that the people can have their say. ‘The whole treaty is a vain attempt to sacrifice practicality and democracy on the altar of ideology. ‘The new treaty is the triumph of expediency over the law.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell added: . ‘These European leaders have gone ahead with this arrangement despite . Britain’s veto and we are powerless to stop it. ‘First of all we were promised a . referendum, then we were told there was a veto. The lesson we have . learned from all of this is we cannot trust the EU mandarin elite. Sixty . million people in this country have been had.’ Earlier, Mrs Merkel hailed the Fiscal Compact as ‘a milestone in the history of the European Union’. She said: ‘I think it’s a strong . signal that we have learned from the crisis and understood the signals . and that we are banking on the future of a politically united Europe.’ In a speech at the signing ceremony, . Herman Van Rompuy said: ‘This stronger self-constraint by each and every . one of you as regards debts and deficits is important in itself. ‘It helps prevent a repetition of the . sovereign debt crisis. It will thus also reinforce trust among member . states, which is politically important as well.’ Speaking the same language: French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, chats with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, center, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel . President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said it was a strong political statement for the EU. ‘In the eyes of the world what is at stake is the very credibility of the euro area and of Europe as a whole,’ he said. But the plight of debt-riddled Spain and the Netherlands cast a shadow over proceedings. Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy said his country’s budget deficit would be 5.8 per cent of GDP  this year – about £12.5billion more than the 4.4 per cent agreed with Brussels. A minority of two: David Cameron and his Czech counterpart Petr Necas, pictured outside Downing Street, were the only two EU leaders not to sign up to the new fiscal pact designed to impose stronger financial discipline on the eurozone . With the Netherlands – one of the few AAA-rated countries left in the eurozone – also struggling to hit budget targets, the credibility of the new deal was already under threat. The fiscal compact will now go before national parliaments and, in the case of the Irish Republic, a referendum. To take effect, the pact must be ratified by 12 eurozone states. Demands: Prime Minister David did eventually get his voice heard . David Cameron yesterday claimed a minor victory after he forced EU leaders to accept British plans to cut red tape and boost growth. The Prime Minister admitted he had been left ‘frustrated’ when his calls for deregulating some professional services and helping small businesseses were initially ignored. Mr Cameron, whose proposals were set out in a letter backed by 11 other countries, revealed he had been forced to ‘bang the table’ to get his ‘voice heard’. However Nicholas Sarkozy claimed the PM only drafted the letter to prevent Britain being ‘left behind’. He said: ‘What a tribute this is to Europe, to send Europe such a lovely letter. ‘Usually if you write a letter signed by other friends, you are either announcing that you are leaving or saying you love someone. ‘I take Mr Cameron’s letter, after his decision not to join this latest treaty, as a sign that he doesn’t want to get left behind.’","Fiscal deal is designed to impose stronger financial discipline on the eurozone .

"One of Britain’s biggest bakery chains saw £30million wiped off its value yesterday following George Osborne’s decision to put VAT on hot take-out food. Greggs, which has branches across the country, saw its share price plunge by 5 per cent over the plan to add the 20 per cent sales tax to sausage rolls, pasties and pies. The take-away tax will add 18p to the price of a 90p hot sausage roll, 50p to a medium Cornish pasty and £1 to a supermarket rotisserie chicken. Greggs, which has branches across the country, saw its share price plunge by 5 per cent over the plan to add the 20 per cent sales tax to sausage rolls, pasties and pies . The move is a hammer blow to Greggs and has also horrified the people of Cornwall, who fear the impact on a pasty industry worth more than £150million a year to the county. Greggs, which is worth £555million and employs 20,000, and the leading supermarkets have made clear it will fight the proposals. Its shares fell 5.37 per cent yesterday, down 29.50p to 519.75p. Tax accountants say the Chancellor’s new VAT rules, which apply from October 1, are bound to trigger a series of expensive court cases. George Osborne said the rules would simplify the tax system and put everyone selling hot food on the same footing as fast food chains . George Osborne said the rules would simplify the tax system and put everyone selling hot food on the same footing as fast food chains. In reality, layers of complexity have been added which could even require a system of inspections to establish whether sausage rolls are hot when handed over at the till. Guidance notes issued by Whitehall to cover the proposals introduce a series of anomalies that will trigger a fierce row between retailers and the Government. The new regime means that, in theory, every food item that is hotter than the surrounding ambient air temperature will be liable for 20 per cent VAT. In the high street, this means a hot sausage roll or Cornish pasty carries VAT but a cold one does not. Councillors in Cornwall said the tax attack would hit jobs and the pockets of residents and workers. Liberal . Democrat Alex Folkes said: ‘Pasties aren’t just a symbol of Cornwall, . they are a key part of our manufacturing economy and thousands of people . in Cornwall are employed either directly or indirectly by the pasty . industry. ‘Raising the price . of pasties, especially when the extra money goes to the Government, not . the firms, will cut sales and lead to job losses.’ Mebyon Kernow councillor Rob Simmons wrote on his blog: ‘If and when this legislation is introduced, your £2.50 medium steak pasty will now be £3, and your £3 large steak pasty will be £3.60. So that’s money out of ordinary decent Cornish folks’ pockets, a blow to our bakers and hardly great news for tourism.’ One insider at a ‘big four’ supermarket described the proposals as ‘comical’. ‘If you take the proposals at face value, you could have a queue of people wanting a freshly baked sausage roll with someone at the front paying VAT because it is hot and someone at the back paying less because it is cold,’ he said. Horrified: The people of Cornwall fear impact on a pasty industry worth more than £150million a year to the county . The proposals also include a VAT exemption for freshly baked bread, which is still warm when it is purchased. The insider said: ‘This leaves the door open for enormous confusion over what is classified as freshly baked bread. Does a hot croissant carry VAT or not?’ He added: ‘Many people come to our stores for a good value hot pastry to take away for lunch. The very last thing people need in the current climate is a new tax on food.’ Most of the main coffee shop chains already add VAT to their hot food, however even they could have to put up the price of a 99p croissant to £1.20 if it does not qualify as freshly baked bread. Stephen Coleclough, tax partner at PwC, said: ‘The Government is trying to remove anomalies but has only introduced new ones which will no doubt lead to yet more litigation which is the one thing the Government is trying to avoid. ‘Bizarrely, products with freshly baked bread aren’t caught in the net. Batten down the hatches for the first court case on the legal definition of “freshly-baked”.’ Many small corner shops, which have diversified into offering hot savoury pastries to boost takings, will be caught by the new rules. James Lowman, of the Association of Convenience Stores, said: ‘We urge the Chancellor to think about bringing more products out of VAT to make them cheaper for consumers, rather than taxing more goods on retailers’ shelves.’ Richard Dodd, of the British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said: ‘This proposal will push up prices for hard-pressed customers.’","Bakery chain's share price plunged by 5 per cent yesterday .

"Half the size of a football pitch, with towering iron columns and soaring arches - it's hard to believe all this was hidden behind derelict Victorian chimneys, empty and unused for over a decade. But now Toxteth Reservoir will open its cavernous vaults for visitors to step inside one of the first examples of public health engineering in the world. Perched at the top of High Park Street in Liverpool, the magnificent structure once provided fresh water for the people of Liverpool. Hidden depths: The Toxteth Reservoir is concealed behind a sandstone facade and a tower on top of a hill on High Park Street in Liverpool . The vast underground reservoir held around 2million gallons when it was in operation, pumping water into thousands of homes. Thomas Duncan, the city's water engineer in the 1850s, designed the reservoir amid increasing concerns about public health. Building was completed in 1853 and it continued to pump water for over a century. But cracks began to appear in the piping and the reservoir was decommissioned in 1997. Water in the area is now pumped in from Lake Vyrnwy in North Wales and the River Dee. Cavernous: The covered reservoir houses stunning internal brickwork and a roof supported by cast iron columns of curved bricked arches . Feat: The building was designed by the city's water engineer in 1853 to supply fresh water to the people of Toxteth is one of the earliest examples of public health engineering in the world . Since its closure, the Grade-II listed . building has stood empty, until recent years, when developers began to . show interest in the abandoned structure as a potential area for . regeneration. It was taken on in the early 2000s by developers Dingle 2000 development trust, which floated plans for the reservoir including turning into an arts venue, an education centre, and a space for cafes and restaurants. A new tower on top of the existing sandstone building was also suggested as a viewing platform from which visitors could look out over Liverpool and Mersey. But conversion work had to stop around ten years ago because of a leaking roof. Developers in 2011 estimated that it would cost around £2million to restore the building. Fortress: The Grade II listed building has not been used since it was closed down in 1997 . Reborn: Cass Associates, which has bought the structure, has plans to make it a community resource with markets, events and restaurants . Now the building has been obtained by Cass Associates, which hopes to restart plans to turn it into a community centre and boost regeneration in Toxteth. More recent short-term plans include installing beehives and polytunnels to grow food for the local area, and a solar panel farm. The creation of a rooftop retreat for the Refugee Support Project located just across from the reservoir has also been discussed. The building will open for visitors on Friday from 10am-4pm as part of Liverpool Heritage Open Month. The event sees 70 venues open in the city between September 7-15, including better-known buildings such as St George's Hall and the Town Hall.

"An independent Scotland will be saddled with a crippling national debt of at least £140billion, Scots are to be warned as the battle to keep the United Kingdom together gathers pace. As David Cameron taunted Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond for seeking to delay an independence referendum for two-and-a-half years, Government sources said the economic implications of a break-up would feature heavily in a future No campaign. The latest spat comes as a poll revealed a third of Scots back the dissolution of the union, a figure that is mirrored across England and Wales. The Scottish National party and its leader Alex Salmond, pictured right . accused Mr Cameron, pictured left, of dictating the terms of a . referendum to Scotland . The YouGov poll for The Sun showed that 33% of Scots questioned backed independence while 53% were against and 14% stated that they were undecided. In England and Wales 33% of those polled said that they backed the split though only 37% claimed they were against independence for Scotland. A total of 30% remained undecided. This latest poll indicated that support . for independence across Scotland has grown since Salmond's Scottish . National Party swept to a landslide victory last May when just 28% were in favour. In an indication of the prominence the . economy will play, former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling is being . lined up to head a cross-party effort to preserve the 300-year-old union . between England and Scotland. More than half of Scottish voters want to remain in the United Kingdom, according to a poll released today. Some 54 per cent of people in Scotland questioned by Ipsos Mori for the thinktank British Future said they wanted to stay in the Union - compared to just 29 per cent who backed independence. The poll, released as the Government, set out its position on the terms of any referendum on independence and also showed similar majorities in both England and Wales in favour of Scotland staying in the UK. According to the survey, voters north of the border are slightly more enthusiastic about preserving the Union than people in England or Wales. Some 48 per cent of those questioned in England backed the Union, against 27 per cent who supported independence for Scotland.In Wales, 41 per cent wanted Scotland to stay in the UK, while 29 per cent said it should become independent. Support for the Union was stronger among older people, with six out of 10 over-55s wanting Scotland to stay in the UK, compared to four out of 10 of those aged 16-44. Independence for Scotland was more popular among men (32 per cent) than women (23 per cent). And middle-class professionals were more likely to want to keep the Union (53 per cent) than those in lower skilled posts (46 per cent) or unskilled jobs (44 per cent). Ipsos Mori interviewed 2,320 people acrossGreat Britain between November 30 and December 6, including 497 in Scotland. Ministers are also considering asking a . Royal Commission to investigate the implications of independence – . including for the national debt, North Sea oil, the British Armed . Forces, Scotland’s currency, the future of the Scotland-based nuclear . deterrent, and whether a diminished UK could keep its seat on the UN . Security Council. Economists say an independent Scotland . would have to take drastic steps to further curb public spending or . risk a debt crisis like those in Greece and Portugal, which have . towering sovereign debts. UK national debt is forecast to hit . around £1.4trillion by 2014, when Mr Salmond says he wants to hold an . independence referendum. At around 10 per cent of the UK total, Scotland’s allocation of public spending is higher than its share of population. If its share of the national debt is allocated on this basis, it will be saddled with debts of around £140billion. English Tory MPs say an independent . Scotland should also be made to take back the £187billion in toxic . assets of the Royal Bank of Scotland, currently held by the Treasury. Mr Cameron said yesterday he . ‘passionately’ believed in preserving the Union and mocked Mr Salmond’s . suggestion that the poll should take place in autumn 2014, shortly after . the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, Scotland’s most . famous military victory over England. The Prime Minister told MPs: ‘Frankly, . I am sad we are even having this debate, because I support the United . Kingdom so strongly, but we have to respect the fact that Scotland voted . for a separatist party at the Scottish parliamentary elections.’ He said he was ‘looking forward’ to . the debate, and mocked the SNP for seeking to delay the poll, telling . MPs: ‘I sometimes think when I listen to them that it is not a . referendum they want, it’s a neverendum.’ Scotland's nationalist government reacted with fury yesterday to the Prime Minister's attempts to wrestle control back from First Minister Alex Salmond (pictured right) Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘We . believe the United Kingdom benefits the people of Scotland and the . people of the rest of the United Kingdom in equal measure. We are . stronger together and weaker apart.’ Mr Salmond said the Prime Minister . should ‘butt out’ of an issue for Scottish people and claimed his . intervention had provoked a ‘huge adverse reaction... to the . Thatcheresque idea that Downing Street knows best’. The First Minister risked being branded anti-English after telling Westminster politicians to ‘stay home and think again’. Scotland’s unofficial national anthem, . Flower Of Scotland, includes the lyrics ‘sent him homeward to think . again’ in a reference to Robert the Bruce’s victory over England’s . Edward II at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Mr Salmond suggested he wanted to open talks with Westminster on holding a legally binding referendum. Initial contacts between officials are . thought to have started already, and Mr Cameron is expected to visit . Scotland in the next few weeks.","Government sources say economic implications of breakup will feature heavily in a No campaign to Scottish independence referendum .

"Hundreds of children are being subjected to physical abuse in madrassas, an investigation claims. At least 250,000 Muslim youngsters attend the religious instruction centres, which are not formally regulated. And more than 400 allegations of physical abuse have been made over the past three years, with the total reaching 146 last year and 89 in 2009. Violence: A Muslim teacher pulls a pupil towards him and strikes him on the back at the Markazi Jamia mosque in February's Dispatches documentary . Prosecutors fear the real numbers may be higher because many parents are reluctant to make formal complaints – or are pressured to withdraw them. In a large number of cases children claim to have been hit with sticks or other implements. At a Lancashire mosque, children as young as six were punched in the back, slapped, kicked and had their hair pulled. In Lambeth, South London, staff attacked youngsters with pencils and even a phone cable. The stark findings coincide with a dramatic increase in the number of madrassas as a result of a growing Muslim population, which has now hit 2.5million, with half 25 or younger. Children in madrassas spend about ten hours a week on Islamic law and learning to recite the Koran in Arabic. Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, founder of the Muslim Institute think-tank, said large numbers of unregulated groups were opening madrassas – most often in mosques but also in garages, abandoned pubs or private homes. Widespread abuse: The Channel 4 programme showed a child being slapped, which figures now reveal is common practice . Lesson in hate: A teenage pupil left in charge during a teacher's absence threatens a younger child with a bench . He said: ‘We are basically destroying the lives of young people. ‘Some kind of system must be put in place to ensure that only teaching takes place there, not sexual or physical abuse.’ The figures were obtained through a freedom of information request to more than 200 local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales. Officials were asked to disclose information on allegations of physical and sexual abuse over the past three years. They disclosed 421 allegations of physical abuse, only ten of which went to court, leading to two convictions. The councils also disclosed 30 allegations of sexual abuse over the same period, which led to four prosecutions and one conviction. Hitting out: A teacher raising his arm to strike a child - an act that is still legal in part-time education in the UK . Unregulated: The lessons that featured in February's documentary took place at Markazi Jamia mosque in Keighley, West Yorkshire . Mohammed Hanif Khan, an imam from Stoke, was imprisoned for 16 years in March for raping a 12-year-old boy and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old. Some local authorities told the BBC, which conducted the investigation, that community pressure had led families to withdraw complaints. Mohammad Shahid Raza, chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, which was set up to improve standards in mosques, said he would investigate. ‘These figures are very, very alarming and shocking. There is no justification for such punishments within our mosque schools,’ he said. ‘I’m not sure how wide this unacceptable practice is, but our responsibility is to make those who run the mosques realise we live in a civilised society and this is not acceptable at any cost.’ Mr Raza said he wanted the issue dealt with through self-regulation. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the North West of England, said he believed the local authority figures represented ‘a significant underestimate’. ‘We have a duty to ensure that people feel confident about coming forward,’ he said.",Revelations follow undercover investigation into  beatings and hate lessons at madrassas in Britain .
"A disabled couple, both 85, were fined after they spent too long doing their food shopping and overstayed in a car park by just 19 minutes. Joyce Woraker walks with two sticks after having a hip replacement while her husband Ivor has become slow on his feet as he recovers from a heart attack. The couple went to Aldi in Colchester in Essex to do their weekly food shop but ended up overstaying the store's 90 minute limit in the car park and received a fine. They were ordered to pay £40 after they overstayed by 19 minutes and were warned this would increase to £70 if they did not pay within two weeks. Ivor and Joyce Woraker, both 85 and disabled, were given a £40 fine for overstaying in Aldi car park in Essex . Their daughter Carolyn McKeever, 60, of Essex, challenged the fine saying that her parents' disabilities made it difficult for them to walk round the store at speed. 'It is fair to say they are not the fastest up and down the shopping aisles and both of them have to stop for breath every so often,' she said. 'For people like my parents, doing their shopping is like a day out. 'They stop and look at the offers and talk with other customers.' Mr and Mrs Woraker had parked in a disabled bay of the car park for Aldi in Colchester for 109 minutes . The elderly couple, from Layer Marney, Essex, had parked in a disabled bay at 10.51am outside the store. But after doing their weekly food shop they returned to their car at 12.40pm. They had been parked for a total of 109 minutes - just 19 minutes over the limit imposed at the site. The couple were told the £40 fine could rise to £70 . Days later they received a letter from Parking Eye, which runs the car park at the supermarket, informing them they had incurred a fine. Mrs McKeever tried to challenge the fine with Aldi but was told she would need to provide a copy of her parents' receipt. The couple had not kept this and Aldi said they were unable to identify their visit because they paid with cash. Staff at the store said it was also impossible to identify the couple's trip despite Mrs McKeever listing 15 items they had bought. Mrs McKeever said her parents were upset as they had never been fined in their lives. She agreed to pay the charge but lodged an appeal on their behalf. Parking Eye has since agreed to rescind the fine after it was contacted by a local newspaper about the story. Mrs McKeever said: 'Allowing 90 minutes for people with disabilities to get around the shop isn't enough. 'Of course it is a enough for able people, but for disabled people like my parents, it just isn't.'","Joyce and Ivor Woraker,  85, went to Aldi in Colchester to do food shop .

"Conrad Hilton Jr appeared in a Los Angeles court on Tuesday, nearly seven months after 'going insane' on an international flight back in July. The 20-year-old little brother of Paris Hilton created a raucous scene aboard an airplane while flying from London to LA, as he allegedly 'screamed and threatened flight attendants' yelling profane statements such as 'I will f**king own anyone on this flight; they are f**king peasants.' Hilton and his team are blaming his behavior on a sleeping pill and hoping that his recent stint in rehab will prove him to be a changed man. This as Hilton left the courthouse with a smug smile on his face before looking at one photographer and telling him; 'You're a scumbag.' The judge released Hilton on $100,000 bail, but forced him to surrender his passport and remain in the state of Californian until his next court appearance in March. Scroll down for video . Conrad Hilton (above) appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom on Tuesday . Arrested:  Hilton, pictured arriving at Los Angeles International Airport in May 2014, was arrested on Monday seven months after causing a loud disturbance abroad an international flight from London to LA . Conrad - who is the grandson of famed hotel billionaire Conrad Hilton Sr - was 'ferociously punching the bulkhead of the plane, ten centimeters from a flight attendant's face' and 'went berserk causing children on the plane to cry.' Witnesses revealed to the gossip site that he was yelling offensive blurbs such as 'If you wanna square up to me bro, then bring it and I will f**king fight you' and 'I will f**king rip through you and kill you.' Also many on the same flight believed Conrad was smoking marijuana as they noticed a 'smell of weed seeping out of the bathroom.' Hilton heir: Conrad's famous siblings include Barron, Nicky and Paris Hilton (pictured at a family dinner in December) Famous parents: He is the youngest child of Kathy and Rick Hilton, chairman and co-founder of Hilton & Hyland real estate brokerage firm (pictured on December 24) Illegal act: The 20-year-old was allegedly smoking marijuana in the bathroom of the plane (pictured on June 7) When Conrad fell asleep, 'the captain authorized crew members to restrain him to his seat for the descent and he was ultimately handcuffed to his seat.' This was not the first time, the young hotel heir had caused a disturbance on a plane. Another source told the site: 'Conrad grabbed a flight attendant's shirt and said ""I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss! My father will pay this out. He has done it before. Dad paid $300k last time.' His father, Rick Hilton, has built a commercial real estate empire with his real estate brokerage company Hilton & Hyland and has an estimated net worth of $300m. Daddy pays for his mistakes: Hilton's net worth is approximately $300m with most of his profits coming from high end commercial real estate . Days before his arrest: Rick snapped this photo of Conrad and a female pal in Las Vegas on his Instagram account on Sunday . The Hilton family's attorney, Robert Shapiro confirmed to the gossip site that 'Conrad took a sleeping pill before the flight and wasn't himself.' In documents obtained by TMZ, Conrad 'admitted to taking a sleeping pill before the flight and then bragged that he ""buried"" flight attendants' by telling the crew that he 'could get all of their jobs taken away in less than 30 seconds.' In his client's defense, Shapiro said there are 'numerous news reports and cases of people experiencing adverse effects including aggressive outbursts.'

"Toy makers have ceased production of controversial dolls of slave characters from Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster Django Unchained after outraged civil rights activists demanded they be withdrawn from sale. The figurines represent characters from the ultra-violent film Django Unchained, which tells the story of a former slave who travels across America to find his wife and free her from slavery at the hands of a cruel plantation owner. Amazon.com was selling three, eight-inch tall plastic dolls representing the black slaves Django, Broomhilda and Stephen as part of a series of figures from the film. No longer for sale: The series of six action figures from the film are now unavailable from Amazon.com . But black community leaders called for them to be withdrawn from sale saying they 'trivialise the horrors of slavery'. TMZ reported that shortly after advocacy groups including Al Sharpton's National Action Network and Project Islamic Hope spoke out, the Weinstein Company asked that the toy line be discontinued as soon as possible. They were produced by National . Entertainment Collectibles Assocation (NECA) in collaboration with the . Weinstein Company, the studio that produced Django Unchained. The toy company, which said they had no intention of causing controversy, ceased production immediately. Only 1,000 dolls were reportedly produced before production stopped. The Weinstein Company has yet to comment on the halt. Najee Ali, director of the Los Angeles civil rights group Project Islamic Hope, said he and other figures in the black community were 'outraged' to hear of the action figures and said they were 'a slap in the face of our ancestors'. Calling for a boycott of the products, which were by then no longer available on Amazon.com, he added: 'We feel that it trivializes the horrors of slavery and what African Americans experienced. 'Tarantino and Weinstein didn't have action figures for their movie Inglorious Basterds because they know the Jewish community would never allow it, and the African-American community shouldn't allow anyone to disrespect our ancestors.' Mr Ali organized a major protest and rally outside the Golden Globes Award ceremony to draw attention to 'the injustice and disrespect to our African ancestors.' He was supported in this by the National Action Network, the New York-based civil rights organisation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several churches and other community groups. National Action Network's president in Los Angeles, the Reverend KW Tulloss said: 'Selling this doll is highly offensive to our ancestors and the African American community.' The three slave dolls were part of a series of several featuring characters from the film.  The slave dolls show Django, the freed slave played by Jamie Foxx, Broomhilda, his wife, played by Kerry Washington, and Stephen, another slave, played by Samuel L Jackson. The remaining, white, dolls include plantation owner Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo di Caprio, a bounty hunter called Schultz (Christoph Waltz), and Butch (James Remar). Controversial subject matter: Freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx, left) comes up against plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio, right) in the film . When the figures were announced, NECA . Joel Weinshanker said the company was 'very excited to bring the . stellar cast of Django to life and honoured to be working with another . Tarantino masterpiece', according to the Daily Beast. In the company's defence, the figurines are said to be intended not as toys but as collectibles for adults rather than children. But reviewers on Amazon.com, where the dolls are no longer available to buy, have other ideas. One . wrote: 'Why? Really this is some racist s***! The movie was good, but . this is inexcusable.  Do the accessories include whips, chains and klan . members?' Another said: 'I . am in complete shock that someone would exploit the struggle of my . ancestors and the entire freedom movement with such tasteless, . classless, and disgusting ""action figures"". 'Shame on Amazon for even selling these.' The . film has already attracted criticism for its subject matter and its . liberal use of the word n*****, which is said more than 100 times. Director . Spike Lee took to Twitter to express his outrage at what he perceived . as offensive sujbject matter, saying: 'American Slavery Was Not A Sergio . Leone Spaghetti Western. 'It Was A Holocaust. My Ancestors Are Slaves. Stolen From Africa. I Will Honor Them.' [sic] . Jamie Foxx stars as a freed slave who turns bounty hunter as he travels around America to find his wife and free her from slavery . In Django Unchained, Christoph Waltz plays Dr King Schultz, left, a bounty hunter who asks Django (played by Jamie Foxx, right) for help . Django Unchained opened in the US on Christmas Day after its LA premiere was cancelled due to the Sandy Hook school massacre.  It is due to open in the UK on January 18. In the U.S. the film has become Tarantino's biggest box office hit, grossing $129.1 million in theaters since its release. Tarantino, who has been under fire for his inclusion of racially charged language in the Django script, defended his inclusion of the N-word in the script - and repeated it in front of gathered reporters. 'They think I should soften it, that I should lie, that I should massage,' he told the Hollywood Reporter. 'I would never do that when it comes to my characters.' The director also said that slavery continues in the U.S. - it has just taken on a different form. 'If . you go to Malaysia, there's sexual slavery going on in places like . that, but I'm more concerned about the slavery that is going on in . America,' he said. 'The . drug laws that have put so many black males in jail that wouldn't have . existed in the `70s, that is slavery. It is just straight up slavery as . far as I'm concerned.'","Eight-inch plastic figurines were selling on Amazon to publicize new movie .

Claims: Angela Johnson (right) claims Kyle Chrisley, 23, choked her, and threatened her with a knife during their relationship . Battle: Angela Johnson with her daughter, Chloe. Johnson, who shares custody of the toddler with Todd Chrisley, 45, says he is determined not to let Chloe return to her father, claiming Kyle is unfit . Johnson, who shares custody of the toddler with Todd Chrisley, 45, says he is determined not to let Chloe return to her father, claiming Kyle, Todd's eldest son, is an unfit father. In an exclusive interview with Life & Style Johnson revealed shocking allegations of Kyle's violent behavior and drug use. 'He grabbed me and choked me when I was pregnant,' Angela tells the magazine of Kyle, who was charged with assaulting her in 2013. Father and daughter: Kyle with Chloe in a photo Johnson posted on her Facebook page . Family: Grayson, Julie, Kyle's daughter Chloe and Todd leave after an appearance on The Today Show . Now you see him: Kyle was on the first season of Chrisley Knows best, but he's been kicked off the show . 'There was a time when he got mad at me and came at me with a knife while I was holding Chloe. 'He was talking about stabbing me, then threw a bottle of pills and hit me and Chloe right in the face with them.' Angela also insists Kyle hid his drug use when they were together. 'He lies about everything,' she says, 'but I could tell he was jacked up because he was always just moving around.' Johnson tells Life & Style: 'Kyle is saying he wants Chloe, but he's really after money.' But Kyle, who admits he was once diagnosed as bipolar, insists he's now 'stable' and ready to parent Chloe with the help of his wife of six months, Lexi. 'She's a mental case,' said Kyle. 'I don't want any money. I want my daughter.' The show depicts Todd as the man with everything money can buy and a picture perfect family to boot: his ex-pageant queen wife, Julie, his beautiful blonde-haired children Lindsie, 25, Chase, 18, Savannah, 16 and Grayson, 8, his adorable grandchild two-year-old Chloe and lovable matriarch Nanny Faye, 70. A changed man: Klye with his new wife Lexi and their dog Milo. He is adamant that his problems are in the past and angry at his father's continued depiction of him . Kyle blasted Chrisley's 'fairy-tale' existence as a sham, dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt, toxic and a snake who has shut him out of his own child's life . But in an exclusive interview with MailOnline last month, Kyle blasted Chrisley's 'fairy-tale' existence as a sham, dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt, toxic and a snake who has shut him out of his own child's life. He also claimed he had turned his life around, saying: 'My dad showed no interest in Chloe at all until the show and until it was pointed out that having a mixed race child and getting her and all that would be good for his demographic. 'He didn't want to see her before then. He said he wanted nothing to do with her. 'This show has been nothing but bad for me. At this point he's ruined me and he's ruined the other three kids he's had who are spoiled. Tension: Kyle blasted Chrisley's 'fairy-tale' existence as a sham, dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt, toxic and a snake who has shut him out of his own child's life . 'But I'm not taking a chance on him ruining my daughter. I'm not taking a chance on him being part of my daughter's life and with Todd Chrisley everything is extreme - it's all or nothing. So it has to be nothing. 'We're fighting this through court and I think that in two to three months we should have Chloe with us.' Chloe, he said, was the product of a one-night stand with her mother, and the two did not  have any sort of longer term relationship. House of horrors: Teresa Terry, who was married to Chrisley and is Kyle's mother says she was a battered wife . At the beginning of last year it was reported that he had attacked Angela, threatened her with a knife and attempted to kidnap the child. He vehemently denies the allegations which did not result in any charges being brought. Angela is not a presence in her daughter's life anymore he claims. Kyle does not know for sure what arrangement she and Chrisley came to when he and Kyle fought for custody. According to Kyle she got a second hand Toyota Prius, with 200,000 miles on the clock but he is not clear what she gave up in exchange. He said, 'I was on drugs at the time [she was conceived]. I was on meth. At my worst I would do it all day every day. It was my life.' In an episode showing the family's Father's Day preparations, Chrisley's children posed for a photograph - all but Kyle who was not there and was barely mentioned. When he was mentioned, it was by Chrisely who explained, 'My eldest son Kyle has had some difficulty in his life which is unfortunately as a result of Kyle doing drugs. We still struggle with this. We've been dealing with this since 2009. 'Does it bother me now as much as it did then? Yes it does bother me. How do you deal with that?' He added, 'Kyle is not interacting with his family on a daily basis so right now Chloe has to be with us. 'It's heart-breaking and it's compounded now that we have a granddaughter.' Speaking from the neat apartment in Chamblee, Atlanta, that he shares with Lexi, Kyle admitted that his past was checkered with drug and drink problems. He has, he said, 'been in and out of rehab probably 20 times in my life.' But was adamant that his problems were in the past and angry at his father's continued depiction of him as a user, unfit to be a parent. He said, 'I have been clean now for more than a year. I've taken tests. Every one is clean - urine which is instant and hair follicle which goes back six months.' But for Kyle, his father's refusal to acknowledge just how far his eldest son has come, is all about control and the complex emotional and legal ties that binds them together and stand between him and custody of Chloe. Bride: Todd's first wife Teresa Terry says she knows how dark the reality behind Chrisley Knows Best really is. Teresa was 19 and Todd was 21 when she became pregnant with daughter Lindsie and the couple married . Behind the smiles: Teresa Terry and Todd hold daughter Lindsie and son Kyle . He explained, 'Five years ago he took out a legal guardianship on me. And five years ago I do believe that if he wouldn't have got it I would probably be in the ground by now because I was that bad on drugs. 'I was 130lbs - I'm 180lbs today - I looked like I was starving. I could have died plenty times.' But, he continued, 'At that same time I don't see how any sort of judge could have signed off on the guardianship that he got. 'At 18 it should have been a medical guardianship so if they see me on drugs or relapsing or having mental health issues you can intervene and send me to a treatment facility. 'But no, he got a guardianship and every box you can mark he marked it. Can't sign a legal document, can't contract to get married, can't do this, can't do that. And so I have monitored custody of Chloe but he can do what he likes really. I see her for 30 or 40 minutes with everyone there. Interviewed: The full talk with Angela Johnson can be read in this issue of Life&Style . 'He puts a curfew on that she has to be back by 6 o'clock. Or he just ups and goes to California with her. The picture Kyle paints of his father is a very different one from the ultimately caring, if overbearing, patriarch on screen. But it is not a world away from the one shared by his mother, Teresa Terry, 43, when she broke her silence of 20 years and spoke to MailOnline. She is another figure from Chrisley's life who didn't really fit with in the court of Chrisley and was airbrushed out of history when the family was introduced to the public in season one. She is mother to both Lindsie and Kyle. Teresa's seven-year marriage to Chrisley ended in an acrimonious divorce which saw her bring a domestic violence case against Chrisley. In court documents his ex-wife accused him of 'waging a campaign of mental and physical abuse' against her. He was accused of stripping her naked and 'battering her' with a closed fist. And when she left him she claimed he hired a detective to track her down with her new lover, now husband of many years, and left her 'fearing for her life.'","Angela Johnson claims the 23-year-old attacked her while she was pregnant .

"Skin cancer prevention messages have started to become scare campaigns as people are hiding from the sun, increasing the risk of heart-related conditions, a British scientist claims. Professor Martin Feelisch says recent research shows that there are more positive benefits to moderate exposure to the sun than there are detrimental effects - despite skin cancer claiming the lives of 2,000 Australians every year. The Clinical and Experimental Sciences Professor, from the University of Southampton, made the controversial statements at The Australian Health and Medical Research Congress in Melbourne this week. Scroll down for video . Professor Martin Feelisch says recent research shows that there are more positive benefits to moderate exposure to the sun than there are detrimental effects . Professor Feelisch said the health benefits of sunlight should be highlighted to help reduce high blood pressure which often leads to heart disease and stroke. He added that there needs to be a greater balance of the negative and positive effects of the sun exposure referring to research published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 'That may be very important for a high risk group but that high risk group are the minority of the population,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'Many others would probably very likely tolerate higher than currently recommended exposure levels, provided their skin gets gradually used to this, and their health would benefit from that.' However, Cancer Council Australia CEO Professor Ian Olver told Daily Mail Australia he disagreed that only a minority of people were at a high risk of danger from the sun. 'Certainly fairer skinned people have more of a chance of burning than darker skinned people,' he said. 'But there's a whole range of occupations where people get a lot of sun exposure.' 'And also going to the beach is a leisure activity which is very popular across the whole spectrum of society, so I don't think we are talking about a small sub-group.' Professor Feelisch claims people are too scared to expose themselves to natural sunlight . Professor Feelisch says skin cancer prevention campaigns were sending the wrong message to the public. 'Everybody is so scared to expose themselves to natural sunlight or slap on sunblock lavishly even if they go outside for 15 minutes,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'That is cutting precisely the bit that is required to keep us healthy.' Professor Olver said the last thing the national foundation sought to do was encourage people to shun sunlight. 'We don't want to scare them from going out in the sun at all - we want to protect them when the sun is likely to burn them,' he said. 'We are using the UV index - so three and above is where you need protection when you are out in the sun - less than three you don't.' Cancer Council Australia Professor Ian Olver says people need to cover up when the UV index is over three . There are 2,000 people who die every year of skin cancer in Australia . He said the aim is to prevent the current figure of  2,000 people dying of skin cancer each year in Australia. 'We are a unique country because you've got a Caucasian population in a climate where they are not as protected naturally because they don't have as much pigment in their skin so they are more likely to get burnt in intense sunlight,' he said. 'You do need some sunlight for things like vitamin D production - so we want them to get a balance.' Professor Olver recommends people download the The Sunsmart phone app provides a UV scale to show when the safest hours of each day to be outdoors. 'It shows when it's three and above in different geographic locations as it's impossible to get the same message out to everyone because the sun is more intense in the north than in the south,' he said. 'We want people to enjoy the Australian sun - we don't want them to be scared to go out in the sun -but the times they are likely to burn we want them to put on clothing, sunscreen and sunglasses.'

"The image of a smiling and waving John F Kennedy in his presidential limousine moments before he was assassinated is burned into the national consciousness. We all know the outcome of that tragedy, but one of the key pieces of evidence from the day - the Lincoln limousine - went on to serve four more presidents before it was finally retired in 1977. The car draws crowds at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, where it ended its long journey. Historic artifact: The Kennedy Presidential limo is now drawing crowds at the Henry Ford Museum . When President John F Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, he was riding in a motorcade through Dallas in the 1961 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible. Completely open at the top, the car, code-named X-100, had no armor or bullet-proof elements whatsoever, a fact incomprehensible today.'The tires were not bulletproof. There was no bulletproof glass. It did have a removable plastic top, but, again, it was just Plexiglas,' Matt Anderson, curator at the Henry Ford Museum, told CBS.'It was no, no bullet resistance in that material. It's amazing to think of it, but they just didn't anticipate that kind of problem.' Uncomfortable: President Lyndon, Johnson seen here in the Presidential limo with wife Ladybird, never liked traveling in the car in which President Kennedy had been killed . The custom-built car cost $200,000 and had features including retractable steps for Secret Service agents and two radio telephones.Following Kennedy's assassination, the car was driven directly back to the White House so it could be examined as part of the investigation.'They determined that the most practical thing to do was just to rebuild this existing car rather than to start from scratch, so, yes, they took the car down to the frame and rebuilt it as a true armored vehicle,' Anderson told CBS. 'The biggest change they made in modifying the car was putting in a permanent roof that could not be removed, and they surrounded the whole vehicle with bullet-resistant glass.' Third president: Nixon had a hole cut in the top of the car so he could stand to wave to crowds . The White House approved a plan for a re-vamp of the car in December 1963. It was completely armored, a top was added and it was given a paint-job in 'regal Presidential Blue Metallic with silver metallic flakes that glitter under bright lights and sunshine.' Lyndon Johnson was two cars behind Kennedy the day of the assassination. After he was sworn in as president, he occasionally had to ride in the car. According to Anderson, he disliked the blue paint job the car had been given because it was too similar to the original color. Long service: Actor John Wayne campaigns with President Gerald Ford in the Presidential limo in 1976, the year before the car was retired from the Presidential fleet . Unforgettable: Despite 50 years passing since Kennedy's death, the tragic day remains fresh in the collective consciousness of Americans . It was promptly painted black, but Johnson was never comfortable riding in the car and avoided it whenever possible. When President Nixon had use of the car, he had a hole cut in the roof as a hatch, so that he could stand up and wave at crowds. Presidents Ford and Carter also used the car, until it finally reached the end of the road and came to a stop at the Henry Ford Museum.","Following the Kennedy assassination, the Presidential limousine was put back into service .

"Sydney Swans veteran Adam Goodes has revealed his friendship with Eddie McGuire is over following the racial comments he made about the player last year. The dual Brownlow Medalist today broke his silence over McGuire's on-air gaffe when he suggested Goodes, 34, be part of the promotion of King Kong the musical. It happened just days after one of the games most loyal servants was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old girl during a match against Collingwood - the club McGuire is president of. Disgrace: Australian Of The Year Adam Goodes was subject to vile racist abuse on Facebook this week . Today Adam Goodes revealed he no longer considers McGuire a friend while speaking at a corporate business breakfast in Sydney. 'I would have liked to have called Eddie a friend before that incident,’ he said at a Corporate Club Australia breakfast in Sydney this morning. At the time of the incident McGuire, 49, went public with an apology and said he would remain as Collingwood' President despite pressure for him to resign. He said: 'It burns me to the core that I would be associated with vilifying.' 'Every part of my being is about equality.' AFL boss Andrew Demetriou said McGuire's comments would be investigated, but his position at Collingwood remained in tact. At the time Goodes singled the young fan out in the crowd, McGuire stood united with him in their bid to stamp out racial vilification in the game. He reacted by stepping in to support Goodes and even shook his hand in the dressing room after the final siren went. 'Very proud' Australian Of The Year Adam Goodes said his indigenous heritage is a very important part of his life. 'Burns me to the core' Eddie McGuire said he felt deeply upset about the comments he made about dual Brownlow Medalist Adam Goodes last year . But all his good work was undone when the Triple M radio presenter made a terrible error in judgement by suggesting Adam Goodes be flown down from Sydney to Melbourne to help promote King Kong the musical. According to Fairfax Media reports today, Goodes said he would still be prepared to shake McGuire's hand, but would not regard the gesture as an act of friendship. 'To have a friend and someone there that night who shook my hand in the dressing room afterwards, to have him say what he did was disappointing and uncomfortable but that’s how friendships end.' Goodes also said he did not regret singling out the young girl who had vilified him. 'It was just a natural part of what I would do on a footy field,' he said. 'It was part of me acting instinctively.' At 34, Goodes has played more than 300 AFL matches for Sydney and was twice named the best player of the year. He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year. On receiving his award he said he was a 'very proud indigenous man' who was keen to fight racism in Australia. He said it was a different accolade altogether to the one's he was used to receiving in AFL. 'I’m a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s not like winning a premiership or winning a Brownlow medal for the skills that you show on the football field, it’s quite amazing.'","Adam Goodes today said he longer regards Eddie McGuire as a friend over 'King Kong' comments .

"Two of England’s most famous prisons are facing the axe. Reading – made famous by Oscar Wilde’s 1897 poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, after he was held there – and Dartmoor, opened in 1809, are among five named by the Ministry of Justice. Blundeston in Suffolk, Dorchester in West Dorset, Northallerton in North Yorkshire and Reading are all to close by next March. Reading Prison, made famous by Oscar Wilde's 1897 poem The Ballad Of Reading Gaol, has been earmarked for closure . Dartmoor Prison, which belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, required ten years' notice before it can be handed back . They have room for a total of 1,400 inmates but are either too expensive to run or need ‘substantial’ investment, officials said. Dartmoor, which belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, requires ten years’ notice before it can be handed back. The Verne jail in South Dorset is to be converted into an immigration removal centre. A new 2,000-place prison is to be built at Wrexham . HMP The Verne in South Dorset, will be converted into an immigration removal centre with 600 spaces . Four of the prisons - Reading, Blundeston in Suffolk, Dorchester in West Dorset, Northallerton in North Yorkshire - will be shut next March, saving the taxpayer £30million. Union leaders said the announcement was a huge blow to the 700 prison guards working there and could lead to ‘severe overcrowding’ elsewhere. The historic Reading Prison has a memorial to Oscar Wilde (pictured) Between them, the four jails have room for 1,400 inmates. Dartmoor - which is more than 200 years old and belongs to the Prince Charles’ Duchy of Cornwall - requires ten-years’ notice before it can be handed back. But the Ministry of Justice wants to find a new use for the jail, which holds around 600 inmates and has its own museum, as quickly as possible. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has given a commitment there will be no reduction in the overall size of the prison estate. Yesterday he said work would start next summer on a new 2,000-place 'super' prison in Wrexham, north Wales. The £250million jail is expected to become fully operational by late 2017, creating 1,000 'much-needed' jobs, Mr Grayling said. Feasibility work has also started on a second large prison to be built in the south east of England, most likely in west London. Move comes after the Ministry of Justice announced plans for 2,000-place 'super-prison' in Wales (pictured is artist's impression) But Prison Officers Association general secretary Steve Gillan said that - with 1,800 staff having already lost their jobs in the last 18 months - the new closures could cause major problems. He warned: ‘With the assaults going on . and the violence going on, we are extremely concerned by the powder keg . situation now in prisons and the severe overcrowding.' Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the closures were part of ministry's cost-saving measures . In other moves, HMP Downview in Surrey will change function to hold male rather than female offenders and HMYOI Warren Hill in Suffolk, will stop holding young offenders and will change to hold adult male prisoners. Mr Grayling said: ‘This is the latest part of our plan to modernise our prisons, bring down costs, but to make sure that by the next election we still have access to more prison places than we inherited in 2010.’ The fresh closures come after it was announced in January that six prisons would shut and three jails would be partially closed as part of a far-reaching overhaul. The MoJ also announced at the time that it would build four new ‘mini-prisons’, known as house blocks, at HMPs Parc, Peterborough, the Mount and Thameside. The mini-prisons will hold up to 1,260 prisoners and will replace older, more expensive prison capacity. Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘The Government is right to be closing down old, Victorian prisons that are grossly inefficient, poorly-located and ill-equipped to reduce reoffending. ‘The replacement of our worn-out estate with large, new hub prisons will deliver massive savings to the taxpayer and provide better opportunities for rehabilitation.’ Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “Closing small local prisons and replacing them with super-sized jails will not reduce crime or make communities safer. ‘You can and should modernise the prison system without throwing taxpayers’ money down the prison-building drain.’","Reading, Blundeston, Dorchester and Northallerton all earmarked for closure by next March .

"Guilty: Roy Hattersley's pet Buster (right) once killed a Royal goose - but he says the new law has flaws . There are no bad dogs —only bad owners. That was what I was brought up to believe. And I believe it still. And that is why I welcomed, with great enthusiasm, the Government’s decision to introduce a new Dangerous Dogs Act and replace the foolish attempt to identify bad dogs with a sensible policy of rooting out bad owners. The purpose of the new Act — which we should all applaud — is to protect the public against dogs which are taught to fight and kill, dogs which are driven wild by neglect, dogs which are taught to intimidate and dogs which so lack training and discipline that they are completely out of control. But the bureaucrats of Whitehall possess a remarkable ability to make even the most sensible policy seem ridiculous. Under the law, which came into force this week, dog owners who simply let their animals growl at strangers or bark in gardens could be ordered to control their pets or face fines of up to £2,500. What’s more, Whitehall has issued a 31-page ‘manual’ entitled Anti-Social Behaviour: Control And Welfare Of Dogs, which describes how the new Act works and includes an incomprehensible ‘flow chart’. The truth is that the document shows every sign of having been written by a civil servant who has never owned a dog and, in consequence, has not the slightest idea about how dogs think and behave. Of course, it was right to change the law in a way that made it possible to prosecute the owner of a dangerous dog, whether the animal attacks its victim on private property or the open road. And the manual, naturally, makes much of the need to protect postal workers. But neither the Post Office itself nor the postal workers’ union has improved its popularity and reputation by behaving as if every dog is a threat and the delivery of every letter is an act of conspicuous gallantry. Indeed, the postman I know best is embarrassed by what he calls ‘all this dog fuss’ and stopped me in the road to say so — stroking my dog at the same time. But the real complaint against the manual is its promotion of so-called Community Protection Orders — a name which might have been taken straight out of George Orwell’s 1984. Police, council officers and social housing landlords can now issue these notices that force an owner to take action, such as attending dog behavioural classes, keeping an animal on a lead, muzzling it or having it neutered. Scroll down for video . Roy (left) says some parts of the manual might have been taken straight out of George Orwell’s 1984 . Examples of the sort of canine behaviour from which the public must be protected, and for which the dog-owner must be punished, lead only to one conclusion: the vast majority of the country’s eight million dog owners are at risk daily of being slapped with a Community Protection Order. For it seems that these orders were invented as part of a doomed attempt to stop dog behaving . . . like dogs. I would certainly qualify for one. As readers with long memories will recall, 18 years ago, my then dog, Buster, when he was young and reckless, killed one of the Queen’s geese in London’s St James’s Park. Natural born killer? Buster would have been slapped with a penalty for killing a Royal goose (pictured) As for my current dog, he spends many a sunny afternoon in what he thinks of as his garden, barking at the dog on the other side of the hedge. That normal behaviour — believe it or not — is now classified as anti-social conduct! I never thought I would complain of becoming a victim of the ‘nanny state’. Not only are my neighbours sensible and civilised people. Their dog barks back at mine. If ever we were both to be prosecuted, one of us would give the other a lift to the courthouse door and the case would undoubtedly collapse. Under the new law, Community Protection Orders are also to be issued when a dog’s behaviour is ‘having a detrimental effect on the quality of life of those in the community’. Yet I fear that this law — which has so little relationship with the real word — is open to abuse by local busybodies. For, we are told, an order could simply be issued if a dog is ‘showing signs of problematic behaviour, such as non-responsive to calls’. We should disregard this nonsense about ‘problematic behaviour’ as nothing more than Civil Service gobbledegook. But the idea that a dog which is ‘non-responsive to calls’ imperils the stability of the community is simply crazy. Most dogs come when they are called — but not always the first or second time. Whenever I walk in the hills behind my house, the shouts and whistles of impatient owners will echo off the bracken. Yet my village remains peaceful and secure. The next time I take a walk, I shall examine the condition of the village green. For the new dangerous dogs manual is particularly severe on anyone who allows their dog to ‘damage flower-beds and benches’ and I assume that publicly-owned grass, mowed at local residents’ expense, qualifies for similar protection. If I see any signs of canine carnage, I shall not take the manual’s advice and provide local officials with details of the destruction ‘through photographic evidence and witness statements’. You may think me lacking in public spirit. But I want to avoid the rest of the village seeing me collect the damning data and making the reasonable assumption that I have lost my senses. There are more examples of normal canine conduct which apparently must be stamped out. Danger dogs: The law was meant to punish owners who force dogs such as Staffies (pictured) to fight . Readers of the manual are invited to imagine that neighbours of a dog-owning family ‘are concerned at the distress and safety of their cats’. They may have noticed that they are chased by the dogs and ‘fear that their chasing is not playful’. No doubt, they are right. For it is in a dog’s nature to chase cats, just as it is a cat’s nature to chase birds and, in turn, a bird’s nature to chase insects. In my experience, the cat almost always escapes. Nor does it show any signs of distress. It sits in a tree or on a nearby wall — a car bonnet will do — and hisses defiance at its pursuer. And all the characters in the little dog-cat drama — up to now without the assistance of the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and the Home Office — live happily ever after. But the example of the definition of ‘bad behaviour’ which riles me most — provoking anger rather than derision — is ‘a dog running loose in the park’ which approaches ‘a group of young children’ or ‘other dogs being walked on leads’ before it returns to its owner. To regard that as an offence is worse than ridiculous. Dogs are pack animals and enjoy — indeed need — company. The other dogs almost certainly welcome their attention. And it is positively wicked — wicked — to encourage children to believe that a dog is something to fear. One of the blessings of my childhood was the lesson, gladly learned, that dogs are man’s natural friend. The child who has not learned that lesson is missing one of the joys of life. Dogs should be, and often are, a delight to young and old. For thousands of sick, elderly and lonely people they provide comfort, consolation and companionship. The last thing they need is the nagging fear that if their dog chases a cat or barks too loudly, some officious individual from the local council will knock on their door and warn them to change its ways or face prosecution. Of course, the bureaucrats will tell us: ‘It won’t work like that.’ But if that is so, why have the powers ‘to work like that’ been created? And why not abandon them here and now? In the meantime, I am worried that thousands — perhaps millions — of dog-owners will feel, at best, uneasy about this foolish new Dangerous Dogs Act. What’s more, the nation needs their support for the part of the legislation which really matters. It is imperative that we track down — and rescue — all those dogs which have been bred to fight. We must prosecute the men who strut around the streets with dogs which they treat as offensive weapons. Bad owners — not bad dogs — are the proper target. But they have to be identified with common sense. Otherwise the whole operation will be dismissed as nonsense.","Aim of Dangerous Dogs Act is to protect public from pets taught to fight .

"Tory said he did not realise what he had written was racist . Offensive remarks: Bob Frost, a Tory councillor with Dover District . Council, has been suspended after calling rioters 'jungle bunnies' and has been axed from his position as a teacher . A grammar school teacher and Tory councillor has lost his job after calling rioters who brought havoc to the country last month ‘jungle bunnies’. Bob Frost, a maths teacher at the prestigious Sir Roger Manwood’s grammar and boarding school, made the comment on the social networking site Facebook on August 7. Soon afterwards the 49-year-old was suspended from his position as a Tory councillor on Dover District Council in Kent after fellow councillors spotted his offensive comments on the social networking site. Then on Monday this week Mr Frost lost his job at the highly-regarded 912-pupil grammar school, the 96th oldest school in the UK, which was founded in 1563 by barrister Sir Roger Manwood. Mr Frost wrote on August 10 - three days after writing ‘jungle bunnies’ in reference to the rioters on his Facebook wall - that he had been phoned up by a fellow councillor and accused of racism. He posted: ‘I have just had a phone call that accused me of racism for my above posting. ‘Looking at the dictionary it would appear that the term jungle bunnies is pejorative and is a racist slur relating to African-Americans. ‘Needless to say I did not mean to use any offensive racist term and was referring to the urban jungle.’ He added: ‘As for the bunny bit it was originally ‘animals’, but I thought people might object to me calling fellow humans this so I chose something I thought was innocent and also cuddly.’ The councillor, who describes himself as a ‘right-wing libertarian’ then removed the post after another call from a fellow Tory and was suspended from the Conservative Party last month while an investigation into his conduct takes place. A panel of district council members will meet to discuss Mr Frost’s comments before deciding on further action later this month. Head teacher Chris Morgan confirmed . that Mr Frost had left the school, in Sandwich, Kent, on Monday this . week, adding: ‘I can confirm that Mr Frost is no longer employed at Sir . Roger Manwood’s School. ‘Mr Frost and the school have concluded by mutual agreement that this was in the best interests of both parties’. At the time Mr Frost apologised ‘unreservedly’ for his comments. He said: ‘What I said was wrong and I apologise unreservedly. ‘I am mortified by the offence that I have caused and have deleted these comments - I am very sorry.’ Deputy leader of the Tory-run council Sue Chandler said: ‘There is no place in our society for this kind of language. ‘We have therefore suspended Mr Frost from the Conservative Group pending an investigation.’ Local Tony Abbotts, 43, said: ‘This guy should be ashamed of himself. ‘Everyone knows that jungle bunny is . an offensive and racist remark and he has landed himself in very hot . water by saying what he did.’ Mr Frost’s Facebook postings have . attracted controversy in the past in particular comments he made about . single mothers in Dover town centre. He wrote: ‘Well, being in the Market . Square you might ask how all the single mothers congregating with their . push-chaired spawn are able to afford both their beer and their tattoos. I have a horrible idea I am paying for both.’ When it was put to Mr Frost that some . of those mothers might be from his own constituency in north Deal, he . responded: ‘While there is a certain demographic which may well fit the . description in North Deal it is most unusual for them to waddle so far . from their territory.’ Prestigious: Sir Roger Manwood's Grammar School in Sandwich where Mr Frost was a teacher .

"A Scotland Yard detective investigating phone hacking has been arrested on suspicion of leaking stories to The Guardian. The move came as News of the World reporter Dan Evans, 35, was also arrested over alleged phone hacking. And in a development that could expose top executives at the defunct tabloid, Glenn Mulcaire, the private eye at the centre of the scandal, has been ordered to reveal who commissioned him to tap into voicemails. Arrested: The 51-year-old officer was reportedly a member of the Scotland Yard team investigating phone hacking at the News of the World . Anti-corruption officers arrested a . 51-year-old detective constable at his desk where he was working on the . hacking investigation, Operation Weeting, on Thursday. It is the first time that a police . officer has been held in connection with the inquiry on suspicion of . misconduct in a public office. Scotland Yard was forced to act over a series of highly embarrassing . leaks to the newspaper which has infuriated the officer in charge of the . highly sensitive probe. Leaks to the paper have infuriated the officer running the investigation, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers. Yesterday, she said: ‘I made very . clear when I took on this investigation the need for operational and . information security. It is hugely disappointing this may not have been . adhered to. ‘The Metropolitan Police Service take the unauthorised disclosure of . information extremely seriously and has acted swiftly in making these . arrests.’ Last night the officer was suspended . from duty and bailed until next month. On the same day police also . quizzed a News of the World feature writer over separate hacking . allegations. The Guardian refused to confirm whether it was the subject of the allegations. Evans, a News of the World features writer, was questioned and released on bail last night. He had been suspended in April 2010 . after interior designer Kelly Hoppen – stepmother of actress Sienna . Miller – brought a damages claim alleging he tried to hack into her . voicemails. Lawyers for the journalist said an extensive investigation found no evidence to support Ms Hoppen’s claims. A senior executive at News International had claimed that Evans’s defence was that he phoned Miss Hoppen’s number for legitimate reasons and accidentally accessed her voicemail when the keys on his phone got stuck.Yesterday the reporter quizzed by detectives for a number of hours before being released on bail. Meanwhile, details about who ordered the hacking are set to emerge after Glenn Mulcaire was ordered to reveal who commissioned him to tap into the voicemails of model Elle MacPherson and five other public figures including Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes by the end of next week.Mulcaire has lost an appeal against a court order obliging him to name those who instructed him, something he has resisted since February. Frustration: Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers (left) was disappointed her instructions were not adhered to, (right) Dan Evans was suspended over claims made by Kelly Hoppen . The ‘significant development’ could reveal who was pulling the strings at the News of the World and whether those in charge of the newspaper, former editor and News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and former editor Andy Coulson sanctioned or had any knowledge of the illegal practice- a claim they have denied.Mulcaire, who was jailed in 2007 after pleading guilty to hacking the phones of members of the royal household for the now defunct tabloid, was forced into the disclosure following legal action by the comedian and actor Steve Coogan.The star’s lawyers argued that if it were proved that the News of the World had instructed Mulcaire to hack into their phones, it would show that phone hacking was taking place at an industrial scale.Mulcaire must now name the executives who ordered him to access the voicemails of Elle MacPherson, MP Simon Hughes, the celebrity PR Max Clifford, the football agent Sky Andrew, Jo Armstrong, a legal adviser to the Professional Footballers Association and Gordon Taylor, the former head of the PFA. High Court: Glen Mulcaire will be forced to give up the names of those at the News of the World who asked him to hack phones as a result of legal action by lawyers representing Steve Coogan, right . Yesterday Mr Coogan said: ‘After six . months of refusing to answer these questions I am pleased that Glenn . Mulcaire has now finally been ordered to say who at the News of the . World asked him to hack the mobile phones of Max Clifford, Sky Andrew, . Gordon Taylor, Simon Hughes MP, Elle MacPherson and Jo Armstrong. ‘Whilst . I am pleased with this latest development I remain frustrated by Mr . Mulcaire’s refusal to answer questions about who authorised him to . unlawfully access my voicemail messages and will continue to press for . these answers.’ At his trial in 2006 Mulcaire admitted hacking the phones of five of the six names in Coogan’s court order. In February, the High Court ordered Mulcaire to reveal who instructed him in relation to the six people. Mulcaire sought leave to appeal but on 1 August Lord Justice Toulson rejected his application. His solicitor, John Kelly of Schillings, described the Court of Appeal ruling as ‘a very significant development’. He . said: ‘He will now have to identify exactly who at the News of the . World asked him to access the mobile phones of the named individuals and . who he provided the information to at the News of the World. ‘Mr Mulcaire is due to provide these answers by the end of the month and we await his answers with interest.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Former News of the World features writer Dan Evans also arrested over alleged phone hacking .

"A teenage cat owner has been devastated to find her beloved pet brutally murdered, hanging from a tree with one eye missing. To make matters worse, it’s believed 19-year old Amelia (who wishes not to share her surname), from Morayfield in Queensland’s Moreton Bay region, was taunted by the cat killer, who placed tufts off the cat’s fur around Amelia’s house every day as Amelia searched for her pet. The RSPCA believe the adored cat, Zeus, was bludgeoned to death with a hammer. It all began when the Morayfield resident made a creepy discovery when her pet was peculiarly found with a shaved back. Amelia was distraught when her cat, Zeus, was found hanging from a tree with his eye missing . Amelia and her partner Mark had owned Zeus since he was six-week-old and adored the feline, who she describes as 'happy and playful' It was just a day after Amelia’s sister-in-law’s cat Theo also turned up mysteriously shaved in their home. ‘We laughed it off when Theo turned up shaved and joked that our cat, Zeus would be next,’ Amelia told Daily Mail Australia. Amelia told Daily Mail that a man across the street’s cat has also been found with its fur shaved. The next day, Amelia, her partner Mark and her partner’s sister Lisa came home to find Zeus was gone. Tufts of fur were found in the house in mysterious locations everyday for the five days Zeus was missing . The day before Zeus went missing, he mysteriously turned up in the family home with his back shaved . ‘It was out of character for Zeus to be missing,’ Amelia said. ‘We saw him before we went out one night but came back and he was gone.’ A day after Zeus went missing, Lisa found a clump of her cat’s fur, which appeared to be carefully placed in their house. ‘While my partner’s sister was cooking dinner, she found a clump of Zeus’ fur in the window.’ ‘It definitely hadn’t been there before. It just appeared.’ Everyday another large clump of ginger fur was found in a different ominous place, and the family immediately knew something was wrong. The family found tufts of Zeus' fur around the home, which they believe were placed by the person who took Zeus before he was killed . On the second day, Lisa came out to the sinister sight of cat fur placed in her car’s windscreen wipers. Three days after Zeus disappeared, fur was found on a toilet paper roll, which was directly under an open window – but there was still no sight of Zeus. The next day, fur is believed to have been placed whilst Amelia was in the house. Fur was found on the home phone, which had not been there when the phone was used moments before. ‘We think someone jumped the fence and came through the backyard,’ Amelia told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Myself and Lisa were both in tears when it happened. We didn’t understand how someone could be so disgusting to bring in our cat’s fur while he was missing.’ The RSPCA conducted an autopsy on the cat, in the hope of finding out more about the killer . They put up posters of Zeus, desperate to bring their ‘friendly, playful’ cat back home. ‘One day, we didn’t find any fur at all and I was kind of glad. But then I got a call,’ explains Amelia. ‘I received a call from someone saying they’d found a cat matching Zeus’ description. ‘I was excited and asked where he was located.’ Amelia’s worst fears were realised. ‘The person told me that Zeus was up a tree, but he is deceased.’ The RSPCA believe Amelia's beloved cat Zeus was bludgeoned to death with a hammer . Amelia’s boyfriend Mark immediately knew something was drastically wrong when he saw her face. Mark ran out of the house first, with Lisa and Amelia behind me, to find out if the awful news was true. ‘I was last to get there but the first thing I saw my partner’s sister crying and I knew it was true. ‘I saw my cat, basically hanging in the tree and he was missing an eye. ‘It was a massive shock, I couldn’t stop crying. My partner told me to go home.’ The cat was high up in the tree and had to be cut out. Zeus was buried by the family, and to their horror they found another tuft of ginger hair placed in their house the next day. The family is devastated and have locked up their home, terrified more harm will come to their other pets . ‘We were kind of worried that if the person watched us bury him, that they might dig him back up.’ The RSPCA conducted an autopsy on the cat and are waiting on more results, having sent more samples to America, according to Amelia. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the incident is disturbing, particularly the ‘game’ that tauned the cat owners, and confirmed the cat was killed from a strike to the head. The RSPCA is looking for more information about who conducted the heinous killing. ""They could face charges of animal cruelty, whether or not they would be in the extreme end, probably not, depending on the circumstances,’ Mr Beatty told Courier Mail. Two other cats in the street have also been found shaved, which happened to Zeus before he disappeared . Cat owners in the street have been advised to keep their animals in doors. ‘We shouldn’t have to keep our cats inside but you kind of have to,’ Amelia said. ‘We also have two dogs and they are stuck inside now. We’ve locked the back door.’ Amelia says she also feels like her own safety and wellbeing in compromised. ‘Everytime we hear something in the middle of the night, we get scared.’ 'It was heartbreaking to see him hanging from that tree.' Amelia and her family are having trouble sleeping and feel their own safety is compromised .","Adored cat Zeus was found dead in a tree, hanging with an eye missing .

"Worry: Of concern is the HFEA's claim that the donations of eggs and sperm must be increased in order to meet the growing demand for IVF treatment (posed by model) Women who give their eggs to help childless couples will get a £750 payment in an attempt to boost the number of donors. Hundreds of 'fertility tourists' are driven abroad each year to seek eggs or sperm in countries which make more generous payments than allowed in Britain. Childless couples, lesbians and single women are also using unregulated websites in desperate efforts to start a family. Until now there has been a cap on expenses of £250 for egg and sperm donors per cycle of treatment. But many experts claimed the payment failed to properly reward women for taking extra risks from the drugs involved. The fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, agreed yesterday to approve a fixed sum payment for the first time to stop donors being out of pocket and deter the use of ‘rogue’ sites. But critics said the decision was ‘disgraceful’, saying poor, vulnerable women would be tempted to risk their health for cash. A change in UK law five years ago which requires sperm or egg donors to reveal their identities to any children born as a result is also blamed by some experts for long waiting lists. Juliet Tizzard, HFEA head of policy, said: ‘Shortage is undeniably an issue. Patients are still waiting for donor conception treatment and are increasingly going overseas.’ Payment: The £750 figure for egg donors is the same as that used in Spain, for instance, while the £35 for sperm donations matches that of Denmark . She warned about the increase of unregulated websites that claim to introduce donors to recipients. ‘Some are making private arrangements where they are organising sperm donation among themselves. We have already written to these websites to highlight our concerns about the risks that sperm donors and recipients can put themselves at.’ CURRENT SYSTEM . Women and men can claim expenses such as travel costs and loss of earnings of up to £61.28 per day. There is a cap of £250. NEW SYSTEM . Women . would receive a fixed sum of £750 and also be able to claim for . excessive expenses. The figure would put the UK on a par with the . Spanish system. Sperm donors would receive a fixed sum of £35. Sperm donors will in future get a fixed sum of £35 per clinic visit, which could see them netting around £525 based on a typical series of 15 visits. The fixed sums include expenses, receipts will not have to be produced, and donors will still only be allowed to help create a maximum of ten families – a rule that is likely to limit women to a single donation of eggs in return for £750. But some experts believe higher payments, which already exist in other European countries, may attract the wrong type of donor and breach EU guidelines that donation should be voluntary. HFEA chairman Professor Lisa Jardine denied the payments would be an incentive to people who were ‘merely financially motivated’. But Dr David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, said surveys showed the British public opposed cash payments and the HFEA was using a loophole by insisting they were called compensation. He said: ‘This is a disgraceful decision which puts young women’s health at risk. By creating a financial incentive the HFEA is ensuring that the risks of egg donation are dumped on young women in financial difficulties. ‘Anyone who think £750 is not a financial incentive knows nothing about life on income support or with your students fees tripled. ‘We already know that a £750 payment, as they have in Spain, creates a financial incentive which explains the surplus of egg donors there. Why was there a massive spike in egg donor applications in Spain when the financial crisis hit in 2008?’ Cash in hand: Under the HFEA's planned scheme, egg donors would be paid up to a limit of £750 for each cycle of donation, compared with the current maximum of £250 (picture posed by models)","Experts hope move will tackle acute shortage of donor eggs in UK, with waiting lists of five years .
Payment will bring us into line with Spain, where there are more volunteers .

"A guitarist from a Britpop band who once appeared alongside Noel Gallagher has been decapitated in a horrific road accident. Jeffrey Fletcher, 36, was killed instantly in a collision in Stockport on Monday afternoon after he leaned out of the window to check the road. He was lead guitarist for Northern Uproar, who had their greatest successes touring with the likes of the Charlatans and the Prodigy in the mid-1990s. Scroll down for video . Mr Fletcher - (pictured, centre left) with Oasis star Noel Gallagher and his Northern Uproar bandmates Leon Meya (left) and Paul Kelly (right) - was described as a 'loving, caring, gentle giant' by his family . Jeffrey Fletcher - who rose to fame in the 1990s as the lead guitarist of Northern Uproar - died in a horrific road accident in Stockport on Monday . His family said in a statement: 'We wish to remember our loving, caring, gentle giant Jeffrey Fletcher for his love of music, his talent on lead guitar and most of all, his infectious laugh. 'The outpouring of love and wishes from friends old and new shows us how loved he has been and this is a comfort to his family. 'We cannot comprehend the fairness of a loss of someone who had such success as a young man to have had his life cut so short in such a tragic and sudden way. 'He will be dearly missed by his family and all that knew him. Goodnight Jeff.' The band (pictured with Mr Fletcher second left) were signed while still teenagers and regularly featured in music magazines NME and Melody Maker . Former bandmate Leon Meya added: 'Jeff was a gentleman and my friend since the age of five, we grew up together and went through school. 'He was a genius and learned the guitar in six months. He was the principle song writer, he could make melodies, sing and was a good performer. He made the sound of Northern Uproar, we were a great team. 'Jeff was recognised as a great guitarist, his guitar work was amazing. He was such a lovely caring bloke, I will miss a proper friend.' The driver of the heavy goods vehicle involved in the crash remained at the scene and is assisting police with their inquiries. No arrests have been made. Sergeant Lee Westhead said: 'Our thoughts are with Jeffrey's family at this difficult time. 'Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit are currently investigating the incident and I would urge anyone who witnessed the actual collision or has information about Jeffrey's whereabouts immediately before the collision, to contact us.'","Jeffrey Fletcher's band Northern Uproar rose to fame in the 1990s .

"A drugs baron jailed for trying to smuggle £35million worth of cocaine into Britain is suing his prison for not giving him kosher food. Orthodox Jew Simon Price, 68, is accusing the prison service of 'institutionalised anti-Semitism' and alleges that both Muslim and vegetarian criminals get more favourable treatment behind bars. The career criminal is serving 28 years after being found guilty of smuggling 700kg of cocaine hidden inside drums of syrup. Claim: Simon Price, 68, is suing HMP Frankland, near Durham for failing to provide him with kosher food . Price alleges he was not given any choice about the food he was served in HMP Frankland, near Durham, in his claim brought under the Human Rights Act and equality legislation. He claims that although prisoners are allowed to cook for themselves in the jail he had to share saucepans and other utensils that are used to prepare non-Kosher food. The cocaine smuggler, who is demanding £2,500 in 'exemplary damages', also claims that the prison have failed to provide Jewish books in their library. He accuses them in the claim of an 'indifferent and discriminatory attitude adopted towards Jews at HMP Frankland which consciously or subconsciously reflects institutionalised anti-semitism', The Sun reported. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'We are robustly defending all elements of the claim.' Haul: Price was trying to smuggle nearly 700kg of cocaine into Britain when he was caught . HMP Frankland is a Category A prison which holds around 750 offenders. Previous inmates have included Charles Bronson and Dr Harold Shipman. Price was jailed in 2005 after a jury heard how he smuggled a cocaine haul from Guyana, South America,to Rotterdam. It was there that the drugs were seized by Revenue and Customs officers before he could get them into Britain. The drugs baron was living in a chateau in south-west France at the time and renting out flats in north London. The court heard that he had previously served 12 years for his role in a £1.5million armed robbery at Heathrow in the 1970s. He had apparently turned his back on crime by 2000 and had set up a cordon bleu cookery college and tried his hand at cognac production before he was persuaded to try and smuggle cocaine. Price has launched his claim after justice secretary Chris Grayling announced plans to stop prisoners using legal aid to sue. The minister said he had been 'appalled' that taxpayers money was being used to allow prisoners to bring 'unnecessary legal cases' which could be dealt with by the prison service's internal complaints system. Announcing a consultation on the plans the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said they would annually save £4 million and cut the number of cases brought by prisoners by 11,000. The proposal comes days after reforms to legal aid came into effect as the Government moves to reduce its £2.2 billion legal aid bill by £350 million.","Simon Price, 68, accuses prison service of 'institutionalised anti-Semitism'

"Offensive rant: David lee, 48, told people to target businesses run by Muslims in a series of offensive messages posted on Facebook . A Facebook troll posted a series of vile messages telling people to attack businesses run by Muslims following the murder of soldier Lee Rigby. David Lee, 48, who lives just a few streets away from Drummer Rigby's family, put the offensive rants on his social media page just 24 hours after the serviceman was brutally hacked to death. In one offensive message, he wrote: 'If just one person petrol bombed any local Muslim business in their area that would be the end of them in one day. 'F*** off you cheeky ungrateful s**m. Allah is a coward just like you. Two can play your game you Allah a*** kissing s**m. 'Take a petrol bomb to the whole shop, light a fire and watch it burn.' Most of the hate-filled message posted by the joiner from Middleton, Greater Manchester, are too offensive to reproduce. The joiner was warned he could face jail after admitting posting the messages on Facebook at Bury Magistrates' Court today. Police arrested Lee after they received an anonymous tip-off urging them to have a look at the Facebook page. He claims to have known drummer Rigby who was murdered just 200 yards from his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, last Wednesday. When he was arrested he told police he was just joking in the posts. 'It was just a joke mate - I didn't mean it,' he told officers. Stephanie Varle, prosecuting, said: 'He accepted that he had made the comments. It is clear that he didn't appreciate the serious nature of the things that he had said. 'Some of the comments clearly come across as offensive but it is not clear if anyone responded. 'Police were able to access this, it may have been an open profile so people who were not just the friends would have been able to access them.'

"An Ebola victim who recovered from the deadly disease in Liberia has been quarantined at New Delhi airport - after traces of the virus were found in his semen. The 26-year-old Indian man had arrived at the terminal carrying documents from Liberia confirming he had successfully undergone treatment for Ebola. But although he had been declared free of any symptoms and his blood tests were clear, Indian authorities placed him in isolation after they tested his semen. An Ebola victim who recovered from the deadly disease in Liberia has been quarantined at New Delhi airport - after traces of the virus were found in his semen . India's Health Ministry said three blood samples from the man tested negative for the disease, which means he is considered recovered according to standards set by the World Health Organisation and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC advises Ebola survivors to avoid sex for three months or use condoms because the virus can continue to be found in semen for seven weeks after recovery from the disease. Sexual transmission of Ebola has not been definitively established, though some studies have shown that the virus can persist in semen for longer than in blood or other body fluids. The ministry said the move to isolate the man was taken 'as a matter of abundant caution' and he would continue to be held under isolation at a special health facility at the airport until his body fluids test negative. 'The person concerned is a treated and cured case of Ebola virus disease,' it said in a statement. 'All necessary precautions are being taken at the isolation facility. This would rule out even the remote possibility of spread of this disease by the sexual route.' Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in the west African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea (file picture) When the man arrived at the New Delhi airport on November 10, he carried documents from Liberia confirming he had successfully undergone Ebola treatment and had been declared free of any symptoms, the Health Ministry said. He was placed in quarantine as a precautionary measure as authorities tested his blood over the next several days. There have been no Ebola cases reported in India or throughout Asia, but there are fears that an outbreak could spread quickly in a region where billions live in poverty and public health systems are often very weak. Early symptoms of Ebola include fever, headache, body aches, cough, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea, and patients aren't contagious until those begin. The virus requires close contact with body fluids to spread so health care workers and family members caring for loved ones are most at risk. Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in the west African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.","Man arrived at terminal with documents confirming successful treatment .

"A pensioner was ran over and killed by her own car as she stepped out to greet a friend, an inquest heard. Rita Wilson had accidentally left her automatic blue Rover 75 in reverse gear when she climbed out of the vehicle in Weymouth, Dorset. As the car started rolling backwards the 67-year-old mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brake sending it shooting backwards. The retired social worker's leg was severed after she was dragged across the car park, before the car finally pinned her against a wooden post. Retired social worker Rita Wilson, 67, was ran over and killed by her own car as she stepped out to greet a friend in Commercial Road, Weymouth, Dorset . Polly Clompus told an inquest into Mrs Wilson's death how they had arranged to meet at a seafront car park on July 16 this year, when the accident occurred. 'She got out of the car and waved and the car started to move slowly backwards,' she said. 'She tried to get back in but I was shocked when Rita and the car careered backwards at high speed out of the car park on to Commercial Road. 'I was in a state of shock.' The car reportedly shot backwards smashing through wooden posts bordering the car park, dragging Mrs Wilson with it. It then spun round and hit the posts again before finally coming to a stop when it hit another parked car. Mrs Wilson, a retired social worker from Weymouth, suffered multiple injuries. She was airlifted to hospital in Southampton, Hampshire, but died 11 days later in hospital from brain injuries. Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest in Bournemouth.

"At dawn Syrian civil servants Abu Asaad and Abu Abdo each begin their commutes across the war-torn city of Aleppo, a once-short journey that now takes 10 hours. A frontline slices through the former economic hub from north to south, with rebels in control of more than half of the devastated city. People like 45-year-old Abu Asaad, who works as a driver for the state, must travel for more than 400 kilometres (250 miles) by bus just to get from one side to the other. A damaged sign in the industrial area of Aleppo, pictured on November 18, which has been devastated by the Syrian civil war . Commuters in Aleppo taking the bus must now pass through checkpoints run by murderous Isis militants . They face grave danger as they detour through an area under the control of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group, which has seized large areas in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. Until a year ago, residents could cross from one side of Aleppo to the other through a checkpoint at Bustan al-Qasr. But because of snipers, it was closed. After working for 10 days straight in a regime-held neighbourhood, Abu Asaad waits for the bus at a station in the New Aleppo district to go home to Shaar, a rebel area just five kilometres (three miles) away. To get there the bus must first cross an area that is under army control, before reaching a desert zone that has become a no-man's land over the course of the more than three-year-old war. He and other passengers then risk their lives as their bus drives through Al-Bab, an area of Aleppo province that is controlled by IS. From there, the bus travels back into Aleppo city. 'Before we reach the IS checkpoint, women climb into the back of the bus and veil their faces completely,' said bus driver Mohammad, who makes the risky journey three times a month. 'They are not allowed to travel alone, according to the laws imposed by the jihadists. So we must make sure they are accompanied by their husband or brother. I check carefully, because I will pay the price if anything goes wrong,' he told AFP. For Abu Asaad, each journey is now a dive into the unknown.

'A jihadist from Daesh gets on the bus, armed with a sword rather than a Kalashnikov,' he said, using an Arabic acronym for IS. 'He checks everyone's documents, and forces suspects to get off the bus, threatening them with his weapon. I always say I am a tailor, because if I admit I am a civil servant, they will throw me in jail,' Abu Asaad said. But all of the forces on the ground - loyalists, the IS and the rebels - have their databases. 'One mistake, and you disappear,' he said. Abu Abdo lives in the rebel district of Sakhur. He too crosses the frontline to get to the ministry where he works. 'Our journey from one side of Aleppo to the other is filled with danger. It used to take 10 minutes, but now it takes 10 hours because of a big detour,' he told AFP. 'There are many checkpoints and dangers along the way, but I must make the journey because I am a civil servant and I have no other source of income. Sometimes, I make the journey twice or three times a week. God have mercy on us,' he said. The bus ticket price has shot up because of the war. The bus journey for some workers across Aleppo now involves travelling across no-man's land, as well as through government-controlled areas and militant check-points . War-torn: A ruined mosque in Aleppo . It used to cost just 20 Syrian pounds to get from one neighbourhood to the other. Now it costs 2,500 pounds ($12.5) from the government to the rebel sides. About 800 people make the journey each day from the regime side, while roughly the same number leave from the rebel area, said Munir, who runs the bus station. People living on both sides say loyalists and rebels demand bribes to let them through their checkpoints, but IS poses the biggest danger for drivers. One told AFP he received 30 lashes because the jihadists thought his beard was too short. Another said he was lashed because he forgot to switch off the radio before he reached the IS checkpoint. A third driver said he spent 48 hours in an IS jail, and that he was only set free when he could recite a prayer correctly. Many passengers make sure to have one last cigarette before climbing on board, because IS forbids smoking. 'This is the road of fear. It is absurd to have to drive for hours through the desert to get from one side of the city to the other,' said Abu Ahmad, who travelled to the regime-held side of Aleppo to see his doctor. 'This division of Aleppo is absurd.' One commuter described the division of Aleppo as 'absurd' Syrian men sit next to a wrecked factory in Aleppo's industrial area, a potent symbol of an economy lying in ruins .","Three-mile, 10-minute commutes in Aleppo now take around 10 hours .

"What christening gift do you choose for the boy who is going to have everything? A £7,000 silver sculpture of his hands and feet, of course. At least, that’s what Pippa Middleton has bought for her baby nephew, Prince George. And while the unusual gift may strike some as a little creepy, Miss Middleton evidently thinks it’s cute. Scroll down for video . Keepsake: Examples of the rather unusual silver sculptures - the actual replicas of Prince George's hands and feet would look different, and be perfect replicas of his features . Royal nephew: Prince George pictured on the day of his christening . Doting aunt: Pippa Middleton splashed out on the pricey gift for George . The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister had the bespoke keepsakes made by a small London company. To create the moulds, the three-month-old future king would have had his limbs placed in a jelly-like organic mixture made of water and a seaweed-based powder. The process takes only 30 seconds – but as any mother would testify, that’s a long time for a wriggling newborn to sit still. Whether Kate and William knew about the extravagant gift in advance is unknown. According to Wrightson and Platt, the company which makes the sculptures, baby hands and feet ‘life cast in silver’, are ‘a perfect keepsake to preserve precious memories in the finest materials’. Each set comes with personalised engravings. Prices start at £1,900 for a pair of bronze hands and feet. For solid silver – the traditional christening metal – buyers can pay anything upwards of £6,200, depending on the size of the child and the engravings. It costs at least £3,000 for a pair . of feet and £3,200 for the hands. It is believed Miss Middleton may have . spent as much as £7,000. The company, which began in a south London studio in 2000, has no fixed price for a gold set. Buyers can also choose cufflinks or a necklace featuring miniature versions of the sculptures. Happy occasion: The proud parents are walked from the chapel by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury who had just baptised George . Senior royals: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are followed from the chapel by the Prince of Wales and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. They and Prince Harry were the only close members of William's family who attended . Smiling and happy: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge grinned at their family as they held their young prince at the big event on Wednesday . Colourful: The St James's Palace detachment of The Queen's Guard turns out in Colour Court, St James Palace, for the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II, ahead of the christening . Miss Middleton, party-planner and socialite, may have taken her inspiration from one of little George’s ancestors. In the mid-1880s, Queen Victoria commissioned sculptor Mary Thorneycroft to carve her nine children’s hands, feet and limbs in alabaster. The figures certainly influenced Denise Wrightson, one of the founders of Wrightson and Platt, to begin sculpting limbs in bronze, silver and gold. A spokesman for Clarence House would not confirm or deny that the sculptures had been given as a present. He said: ‘If such a gift exists it would be a private gift and not be something we would be aware of.’ Meanwhile members of the Cabinet chose a more traditional gift for the baby prince – a hand-crafted pine toy box, which cost £400. Although for a slightly more modest option, they needed to go no further than George’s own grandfather, Prince Charles. He lies on Queen Victoria’s lap . — a baby who will live to see the Moon landings, held in the arms of a . woman born in the reign of George III.

"These jaw-dropping images show the moment a humpback whale leapt majestically from the ocean, 'waving' to a tourist boat before crashing back down with an almighty splash. The photos, taken off the coast of South Africa by marine tour guide Steven Benjamin, captured a sight rarely seen at such close proximity. The 40 ton humpback put on an incredible aerial display, soaring through the air just yards from a boat as shocked onlookers screamed. Scroll down for video . Hello there: A humpback whale threw itself out of the water off the eastern coast of South Africa, waving to amazed onlookers in a tour guide's boat . Having a whale of a time: The humpback had been swimming along the surface of the water, but disappeared for 20 minutes before suddenly leaping from the ocean . Flying fish: The jaw-dropping images were captured by Steven Benjamin, a marine tour guide who just happened to have his camera with him at the crucial moment . The 31-year-old, who was documenting the migration of more than 1,000 whales from the coast of South Africa to the warmer waters of Mozambique and Madagascar, watched as the whale flopped around in the ocean. Mr Benjamin thought the humpback's show was over after 20 minutes hiding deep under water, but it suddenly lifted ts entire body out of the water, extending a fin to onlookers before slamming back down, creating a huge splash. The giant creature was clearly having a whale of a time as the marine tour guide watched from the safety of a boat off Port St John, in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The spectacular display of strength and agility 'blew away' Mr Benjamin, who had never before managed to get so close to a humpback. Mr Benjamin said: 'Huge whale breaches like this are common to see quickly from a distance, but it is exceptionally rare to have it occur close to the boat and have the camera ready. 'I got this shot out of sheer luck. We were focused on this whale whilst it was doing normal tail slapping and half head flops. 'It took a rest for 20 mins and then without notice or warning, it did a single massive breach.' The 31-year-old amateur photographer was documenting the migration of more than 1,000 whales from the coast of South Africa to the warmer waters of Mozambique and Madagascar when the humpback appeared . Splashdown: The whole boat 'erupted in screams' as the whale came crashing down, creating a huge splash, a stunned Mr Benjamin said . Close encounter: Humpback whales are known for their acrobatics, but do not usually put on such displays when they are so near to boats . He added: 'I was stunned. I've never seen such a huge, front on and high breach like that. The whole boat erupted in screams as it landed.' Mr Benjamin, from Cape Town, only started taking pictures of marine life six years ago. The amateur snapper won his camera in a local photography competition, allowing him to capture bigger and better shots. He added: 'People can't believe its a real image, everyone always looks twice and are blown away by it.' The acrobatic animals can grow up to 50ft long, and have a reputation for throwing themselves out of the water despite weighing up to 40 tons. Humpback whales were almost hunted to extinction during the 1960s, but a ban has allowed their global population to reach approximately 80,000.","Marine tour guide Steven Benjamin captured the spectacular sight while whale-spotting off the coast of South Africa .

"All but one of the footballs caught up in the Deflategate controversy were hardly under the regulation limit at all, according to an NFL report. Eleven of the twelve footballs were 'just a few ticks' away from the minimum pressure of 12.5PSI, according to an internal investigation into how footballs used in the AFC title match ended up too flat.

A report on the NFL Network, drawing sources from the official investigation, made the revelation. They found that one ball was significantly under-inflated - by two PSI. It had been speculated that somebody in the Patriots camp could have wanted the balls to be under-inflated to aid the team's playing style. Less pumped-up balls are easier to catch, but harder to throw long distances. The Patriots have declared total innocence of any foul play, with senior figures saying they had never even given a thought to the notion that the balls' internal pressure could be significant.

"Research by a team of European physicists could explain why the universe did not collapse immediately after the Big Bang. Studies of the Higgs particle suggested that the very early accelerating universe should have been unstable - and scientists have been trying to work out why this was not the case. But this latest study suggests that the Higgs boson may have actually interacted in gravity in such a way that enabled the universe to survive. Physicists from Imperial College London say gravity saved the early universe (evolution of the cosmos shown). They say it interacted with the Higgs boson to provide stability 13.8 billion years ago. It was thought the Higgs particle should have made the cosmos unstable, but gravity helped to provide stability . Physicists from Imperial College London, and the Universities of Copenhagen and Helsinki believe this simple explanation could explain the beginning of the universe. In the new study in Physical Review Letters, the team describe how the spacetime curvature - in effect, gravity - provided the stability needed for the universe to survive expansion in that early period 13.8 billion years ago. The team investigated the interaction between the Higgs particles and gravity, taking into account how it would vary with energy. And they showed that even a small interaction would have been enough to stabilise the universe against decay. The Higgs boson's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. It has been described as the ‘missing piece’ of the Standard Model, which explains how the parts of the universe that we understand interact with one another . Without this mass, particles would zip around the cosmos, unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people. The particle was confirmed using the Large Hadron Collider - the highest-energy particle collider ever made, built by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 2012. However, our knowledge of particle physics is still far from complete, with mysteries such as the nature of dark matter to still be solved. It was thought that, under current models of physics, Higgs particles would have been created in abundance in the early universe and caused instability, ultimately leading to its demise. But the researchers found that, at high levels of gravity not possible to recreate in the present day on Earth, gravitational fields actually prevented the production of these Higgs particles. Professor Arttu Rajantie, from the Department of Physics at Imperial College London who was part of the study, told MailOnline this means that our current models of physics are capable of explaining this instability in the early universe - whereas previously they had been thought to be inadequate. This is because they predict that the production of Higgs particles should cause the universe to collapse. But Professor Rajantie's study suggests that under our current Standard Model of physics, gravity would actually have come to the rescue and prevented them from forming. ‘We considered the interaction of the Higgs field with the gravitational field, and this is something that is not known because we can’t measure it in particle accelerators,’ he said. ‘We looked at this interaction and basically you need to have a strong gravitational field to act as a barrier against producing Higgs particles in the very early universe.’ He explains that the production of Higgs particles would have caused instability but ‘gravity prevented it’, allowing the universe to survive. However proving this is true would be difficult, as it would require similar gravitational strength to a black hole, but Professor Rajantie says it is a promising solution as to how the universe remained stable in the fraction of a  second after it formed. The Higgs boson's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. The particle was confirmed in 2012 using the Large Hadron Collider - pictured - the highest-energy particle collider ever made, built by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern) 'The Standard Model of particle physics, which scientists use to explain elementary particles and their interactions, has so far not provided an answer to why the universe did not collapse following the Big Bang,' Professor Rajantie said in a press release. 'Our research investigates the last unknown parameter in the Standard Model - the interaction between the Higgs particle and gravity. 'This parameter cannot be measured in particle accelerator experiments, but it has a big effect on the Higgs instability during inflation. 'Even a relatively small value is enough to explain the survival of the universe without any new physics!' The team plan to continue their research using cosmological observations to look at this interaction in more detail and explain what effect it would have had on the development of the early universe. In particular, they will use data from current and future Esa missions measuring cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational waves. 'Our aim is to measure the interaction between gravity and the Higgs field using cosmological data,' said Professor Rajantie. 'If we are able to do that, we will have supplied the last unknown number in the Standard Model of particle physics and be closer to answering fundamental questions about how we are all here.'","Physicists from Imperial College London say gravity saved early universe .

"Detectives have 'grave concerns' for missing Samantha Henderson who disappeared from her home three days ago . Detectives hunting for a missing mother-of-four have arrested a man on suspicion of her murder. Dorset police said it has 'grave concerns' for Samantha Henderson, 25, who vanished three days ago. A 27-year-old man, known to the young woman, has been arrested by officers and is being questioned on suspicion of her murder. Ms Henderson's family have made an emotional plea for her to return to her home in Corfe Castle, Dorset. 'Sam is a homely, private, loving mother of four children aged six, four, two and one,' they said. 'She is hard-working, always presentable and this is completely out of character for her. 'She would never walk out and leave her children. If anyone knows where she is or what has happened, please contact the police.' Ms Henderson's family have also made a direct appeal to the missing woman, adding: 'No one is upset or thinks anything badly of you Sam. We just want you to come home as everyone wants to help and support you.' She was reported missing shortly before 9am on Thursday but was last seen leaving her home at 4.30pm on Wednesday. She is described as white, five feet three inches tall, of very slim build and with blonde hair in a ponytail. She was last seen wearing a grey jumper, blue jeans and slippers. Extensive investigations are continuing, including a forensic examination of Ms Henderson's home and the surrounding area. Police also urged nearby residents to check garages, garden sheds and outbuildings for any sign of the missing mother. Detective Inspector Neil Devoto, from Dorset Police, said: 'We are extremely concerned for Samantha and while we are hoping for the best, sadly we believe she may have come to some harm. 'We have arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of her murder and he is currently being questioned. We do not know at this time Samantha's whereabouts. The young woman's family described her as 'a loving mother' and said her disappearance was 'out of character' 'Samantha's disappearance is completely out of character. She has never gone missing before and, from what we understand, it is almost unfathomable that she would have left her four young children. 'We also know that Samantha made heavy use of her mobile phone and social media and I would urge anyone who has had any correspondence with her since 3pm on Wednesday to call Dorset Police.' He added: 'I am calling on the public to check their garages, garden sheds and outbuildings in the area in the event Samantha may have taken refuge and fallen unwell.'

"More than 55 million birds are killed by cats every year in the UK alone. But researchers have discovered that dressing felines in multi-coloured collars could drop this kill rate by 54 per cent. During tests, an anti-predation collar known as Birdsbesafe (BBS) was found to give birds more warning about an impending attack due to their advanced colour vision. Scroll down for video . The anti-predation collar cover is called Birdsbesage (BBS) and is designed to be easily spotted by birds, reptiles and amphibians - known as herpetofauna. These animals have advanced colour vision compared to mammals. During tests the collar (pictured) reduced captures by 54% in one year . The $9 collar is sold by a Vermont-based firm of the same name. It is available in yellow, red and rainbow designs and claims to ‘save birds from cats.’ Researchers from the School of Veterinary and Life Sciences at Murdoch University, Australia – led by Catherine Hall - wanted to put this collar to the test. During a two-year period, Ms Hall and her team asked cat owners to report on the number and type of prey caught by their pets. Birds can see certain light frequencies - such as ultraviolet - that humans cannot see. Many songbirds have feathers that reflect ultraviolet light to communicate and attract a mate. Both birds and humans have photoreceptive 'cones' in the retina located at the back of the eye that help the eyes see colour light. In humans, there are three types of photoreceptive cones which are sensitive to red, green, or blue, and this is called trichromatic colour vision. Birds have an additional cone for tetrachromatic colour vision. This expands the visible light spectrum. Birds also have up to 12 times the number of cones - around 120,000 cones per square millimetre - compared to humans. In the first year they studied the effectiveness of each individual colour and in the second year they concentrated on the rainbow collar. They discovered that the number of birds, reptiles and amphibians were reduced by 54 per cent across the board, but the rainbow and red BBS were more effective than the yellow. During the second year, captures were reduced by 47 per cent. However, captures of mammals such as mice and rats were not reduced significantly. The researchers said this is because birds, reptiles and amphibians have a more advanced colour vision meaning they could spot the collar more easily than animals with limited colour vision. Birds, for example, can see certain light frequencies - such as ultraviolet - that humans cannot see. Many songbirds have feathers that reflect ultraviolet light to communicate and attract a mate.

The $9 collar  is available in yellow, red and rainbow designs and claims to ‘save birds from cats.’ Researchers discovered that the number of birds, reptiles and amphibians killed were reduced when cats wore any collar colour, but the rainbow and red BBS were more effective than the yellow . In humans, there are three types of photoreceptive cones which are sensitive to red, green, or blue, and this is called trichromatic colour vision. Birds have an additional cone for tetrachromatic colour vision. This expands the visible light spectrum. Birds also have up to 12 times the number of cones - around 120,000 cones per square millimetre - compared to humans. The researchers also said they found no evidence that cats maintained a lower predation rate once the BBS was removed. The researchers said this is because birds, reptiles and amphibians have a more advanced colour vision meaning they could spot the collar (range pictured) more easily than animals with limited colour vision . ‘The BBS is an option for owners wishing to reduce captures of birds and herpetofauna by free-ranging cats, especially where mammalian prey are introduced pests’ explained the study. ‘To date, the BBS is the only predation deterrent that reduces significantly the number of herpetofauna brought home.’ Almost 80 per cent of the pet owners said their cat showed no signs of distress when wearing the collar, and another 17 per cent said their cat got used to the collar within two days. The research was published in January in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science.","The anti-predation collar cover is called Birdsbesafe (BBS)

"Laura Bates, founder of The Everyday Sexism Project and one of the women behind the #FBRape Twitter campaign . Facebook is changing its policy on content endorsing rape and violence against women after a social media campaign . Campaign #FBRape, set up by activists, highlighted the flaw in the social network’s guidelines which banned hate speech but not offensive remarks regarding sexual assault. Following the hugely successful campaign, which saw several companies pull their advertisements from Facebook, the website agreed to change their policies. In a public statement, Facebook acknowledge its failure to block the offensive content and promised  to train staff to be able to spot such posts in order to make Facebook a' safe and respectful place for sharing and connection'. ‘The guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards. ‘We need to do better — and we will,’ Facebook said in their statement. Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, writer and activist Soraya Chemaly and Jaclyn Friedman from Women, Action & the Media joined forces to launch the hashtag Twitter campaign #FBRape last Tuesday. #FBRape saw companies such as Finnair, Dove and Nissan UK contact Facebook to block their advertisements on the site. ‘I'm so thrilled honestly that they've recognized that they have work to do,’ Friedman told NBC News.’I feel like we're moving to a better place.’ The campaign highlighted that Facebook previously refused to censor content appearing to endorse vilence against women and rape, including insulting pictures and slogans, as well as entire pages and Facebook groups created to promote violence against women. #FBRape posted this image on their website, drawing attention to advertisements next to the image . Examples of anti-women content on the . site include 'Violently Raping Your Friend Just for Laughs' and 'Fly . Kicking Sluts in the Uterus' groups as well as images of sleeping young . women with their trousers pulled down alongside text suggesting they . have ingested and enjoyed 'roofie' date rape drugs. 'Specifically, we call on you, Facebook, to take three actions,' the campaigners wrote in an open letter. 'Recognize speech that trivializes or . glorifies violence against girls and women as hate speech and make a . commitment that you will not tolerate this content. 'Effectively train moderators to recognize and remove gender-based hate speech. 'Effectively train moderators to . understand how online harassment differently affects women and men, in . part due to the real-world pandemic of violence against women.' The group said more than 50,000 tweets . and more than 4,500 emails had been sent through its site since the . hashtag was launched last Tuesday.

'So these pictures and pages hit very . close to home for me.

"Drones aren't the obvious way to give diners a romantic treat but one restaurant is hoping a flying machine laden with mistletoe will do the trick - and bring festive bookings flooding in. TGI Fridays launched the drone after research revealed that 47 per cent of Britons have never enjoyed a kiss under the mistletoe. The study also found that just 27 percent of people were planning to lock lips with someone under the festive plant this year - something the restaurant hopes to change. Scroll down for video . This couple looked apprehensive as the mistletoe drone flew over their heads in the TGI Friday's restaurant . The drone, which can fly at speeds of up to 35mph, has been trialled at chain's Manchester Royal Exchange outlet, where it hovered 8ft above couples. Despite Britons' reluctance to lock lips beneath the mistletoe, 42 per cent of people said that Christmas is one of the most romantic times of year. Four in 10 say that the office Christmas party is the best place to find festive romance, with one in 10 admitting to kissing their boss. Not every Christmas fling ended in embarrassment however, with four per cent saying they went on to marry their colleague. Looks like it's working! Two couples indulge in a quick PDA as the mistletoe flies overhead . 'Everyone loves a good Christmas party, but we all know things can be a bit awkward until someone breaks the ice,' said TGI Fridays marketing manager Rachel Waller of the drone's uses. 'We wanted to see how we could make Christmas get-together in our restaurants even more entertaining. 'We offered guests the encouragement they need to make their move - particularly the one half of UK adults who have never had a kiss under the mistletoe. 'Our mistletoe drones are the perfect way to do this. Not only are they great fun for the entire restaurant, but they help people get a little closer at this romantic time of the year. 'Maybe we'll have had our first mistletoe drone wedding by this time next year.' The drone weighed only 1kg and flew over dinners heads with a piece of mistletoe attached to the bottom of it . The survey, which was conducted by TGI Fridays and spoke to more than 2000 people, also looked which professions are most likely to get involved in a romantic incident at a Christmas party. 63 per cent of those working in hospitality said they would kiss a colleague, with the property industry coming a close second at 62 percent and those in the media not far behind at 56 per cent. But if you don't fancy kissing Pete from accounts this year you're not alone. The research also unearthed the male celebrities we'd most like to kiss this Christmas. Hollywood superstar George Clooney, 53, former footballer David Beckham, 39, and actor Brad Pitt, 50, all came up trumps. Meanwhile, model Kelly Brook, 34, actress Scarlett Johansson, 29, and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 31, are the celebrities men want to kiss the most. The flying drone has a HD camera which can film for up to 20 minutes: Plenty of time to catch the dinners kissing!","TGI Friday have launched a mistletoe drone for the Christmas season .

"The new religion? More than half of Britons give credence to the supernatural or superstition - compared with just 49 per cent who believe in God . If you believe in ghosts, panic when you break a mirror and would rather walk on to the road than under a ladder, you are not alone. In fact, Britons are more likely to have faith in the supernatural than in God, a survey has found. It showed more than half give credence to the supernatural and superstition – compared with just 49 per cent who believe in God. Similarly, more people believe they have extraordinary powers such as a sixth sense than regularly go to church. Market researchers One Poll asked 2,000 adults a series of questions about their beliefs and weighted the results to make them reflect the population as a whole. This revealed that 55 per cent of us put our faith in the supernatural and superstition, and 10 per cent even claim to have at least one supernatural power. Some 29 per cent of these gifted souls believe they can see into the future, while 25 per cent say they can regress to past lives and 23 per cent claim to be telepathic. In contrast, just 8 per cent attend a church or other place of worship at least once a week. The survey also provided a fascinating insight into the grip that superstition has on our lives. A third of Britons consider themselves superstitious, with walking under a ladder most likely to be linked with bad luck. Breaking a mirror bringing seven years of misfortune is the second most commonly held superstition, with the ritual of touching wood for luck taking third place. Fourth is the worry that opening an umbrella indoors is unlucky and fifth place goes to the fear that putting new shoes on the table brings bad luck. Many also believe that Friday the 13th is unlucky, that burning ears mean you’re being talked about and that if you spill salt, you must throw a pinch over your shoulder to counteract bad luck. The idea that a groom shouldn’t see his bride in her dress before their wedding is also pervasive. There is, however, room for one positive ritual. Some 17 per cent of us put stock in the saying ‘find a penny, pick it up and all day long you’ll have good luck’. The survey – carried out to mark the Watch premiere of Believe, a TV series about a young girl with mysterious powers – also showed that more people believe in ghosts than any other supernatural or unexplained phenomenon, with a third of us convinced that spooks and spectres exist. This is closely followed by belief in the existence of a sixth sense and of UFOs. Some have had a close encounter themselves, while others have been influenced by friends, films or celebrities. And one in 25 spends more than £100 a year on tarot card readers and other psychics. Dr Giles Fraser, former canon  of St Paul’s Cathedral, said  he finds it amusing that those who fervently reject religion  are often the most avid followers of superstition. He said: ‘It is certainly the case that all sorts of people who are uber-rational when it comes to God believe in the most amazing hocus-pocus.’","More than half give credence to the supernatural, a survey shows .

"Australians will each spend about $37 less this festive season than they did last year as they worry about job security. A CommBank survey of 1,000 Australians found people will on average fork out $1339 this Christmas, mainly on gifts, vacations and on Boxing Day sales. Compared to last year's survey, consumers will spend about $37 less per person, Commonwealth Bank economist Diana Mousina says. 'It is an indication consumers will spend less which means it could be a worse Christmas than what we saw last year,' she told AAP. Sales are expected to be down this festive season as Australians are increasingly concerned about the cost of living, job security and the economy . Australians will each spend about $37 less this festive season than they did last year as they worry about job security, the economy and their persopnal finances . 'The consumer sentiment numbers continue to be pretty poor. The majority of consumers are pessimistic about their personal finances and the outlook of the economy, predominantly the major concern being unemployment. 'People are worried about losing their jobs.' A total of almost $18 billion is expected to be spent on gifts, food and vacations this Christmas. The majority of the festive budget will go on gifts (totalling $7.6 billion) followed by vacations ($4.6 billion), the survey shows. Spending will differ among the states with the biggest spenders expected to be New South Wales where the average person is estimated to splash out $1339, mainly on gifts, vacations and Boxing Day sales. Queenslanders on the other hand, are the thriftiest. They are expected to fork out an average of $779, largely because they spend much less on vacations, eating and drinking out and on entertaining family and friends than those in the other states. The vast majority of Aussies (72 per cent) will purchase gifts from stores, while 28 per cent will shop online.

"Whenever you find yourself complaining of a cricked neck, aching back or noisy knees, don’t immediately blame your office chair or an over-enthusiastic Zumba class — it could be down to your clothes. Tight trousers and pencil skirts can damage muscles and joints as much as high heels and heavy bags, leaving you in pain. Here, chiropractor Tim Hutchful, from the British Chiropractic Association, highlights the worst wardrobe offenders. PENCIL SKIRT . The problem with straight sided, slim-fitted skirts is that they clamp your knees together, making it difficult to balance and bend. Squatting to pick something up from a low drawer or shelf becomes difficult, too. ‘The best way to crouch safely is to bend the knees,’ Mr Hutchful says. ‘But, in a pencil skirt your movement is limited. Over time the damage and strain can become cumulative — you might not feel anything straight away, but if you wear tight skirts regularly, you could be setting yourself up for a pulled muscle or even disc problems.’ HEAVY NECKLACE . The muscles, tendons and joints of the neck struggle to cope with the strain of balancing the 10 lb to 12 lb weight of the average head (equivalent to five bags of sugar) all day, so adding a heavy necklace can tip the balance. ‘Anything that pulls the neck forwards or backwards tips the head away from its point of neutral balance,’ says Mr Hutchful. ‘This can create neck tension, pain and damage, and long-term could encourage a slouched posture with damaging consequences for the back.’ SPANX . If it’s not too tight, and contains plenty of Lycra, support underwear can have a surprisingly beneficial effect because it can act like the compression clothing that top athletes wear to improve performance by increasing blood and lymphatic flow. However, wedge yourself into something too constricting and you could be in trouble. Not only will shapewear restrict breathing but, if it is tight enough to limit movement in the middle of your body, it will put abnormal loads on parts of your spine. ‘If you restrict movement in one part of the spine, something has to compensate,’ he says. ‘This can trigger pain and ultimately damage in the upper or lower back.’ HIGH HEELS . Wearing high heels too often can be bad for your feet and bad for your back. As well as triggering hammer toes and bunions, heels can cause the calf muscles to shorten, which can lead to circulation problems, knee damage and back pain. To minimise damage, keep high-heel time short — wear trainers when walking to and from work and stick to a small heel when possible. Also, alternate your shoe wardrobe, wearing different shoes (and heel heights) every day. HALTER NECK TOP . A halter-neck bra, bikini, or tightly fitted top can pull the neck forwards particularly if the strap around your neck has to support a large or heavy bust. ‘The strain on your neck will create muscle tension and can pull you in to a highly damaging form of posture called “anterior carriage” where the neck sticks forwards on the body, with the shoulders rounded and slumped,’ says Mr Hutchful. This is a common cause of neck, upper back and shoulder pain. ILL-FITTING BRA . A large bust needs more support than can usually be offered by a pretty, lacy bra. ‘The thin straps of a fashion bra can put too much pressure on the shoulders,’ says Mr Hutchful. Try to find bras with thick straps for everyday use and wear racer-back sports bras whenever possible to spread the strain across your shoulders. OVERSIZED BAG . We’ve long known the danger of lugging a huge bag on one shoulder, but the Victoria Beckham-inspired trend for ‘displaying’ your designer purchase in the crook of your forearm could not be worse. This one-sided weight-lifting can increase the risk of muscle strain and pain in the neck, shoulders and upper back — and can even trigger tension headaches. Carrying a large bag over your shoulder is no better, particularly if you always use the same shoulder. Don’t overfill your bag (‘do you need a litre of water?’ asks Mr Hutchful), hold it by the handle, or over one shoulder, switching sides regularly. SKINNY JEANS . Jeans that grip tightly around the waist, hips, thighs and calves can make a normal walking action impossible. ‘If you aren’t able to take a bouncing stride, you lose the shock-absorbing qualities of a natural walk,’ says Mr Hutchful. ‘This can create undue pressure in the joints.’ Wearing a tight belt could exacerbate the problem, triggering leg pain. And don’t sit for long periods with your phone in your back pocket, the imbalance caused by having one buttock higher than the other could cause back and hip pain.

"An actress whose abusive fiancé lashed out at her when he discovered she was due to appear nude in a play was forced to use her stage costumes to hide bruises. Beverley Stuart-Cole, 48, starred in a series of theatre productions while secretly hiding marks caused by a string of beatings by her husband-to-be Paul Conway. In one violent rage, the 46-year old builder from Sale, Greater Manchester, attacked Ms Stuart-Cole after learning she had been asked to go nude in a play based on the Alfred Hitchcock classic Psycho. Beverley Stuart-Cole (left) used her stage costumes to cover up bruises which were caused by a string of beatings by her husband-to-be Paul Conway (right) On another occasion, Ms Stuart-Cole - who regularly appears at the Garrick Theatre in Altrincham, Greater Manchester - had to use the long gloves in her stage costume to hide deep bruises on her arms caused by Conway. Today, Ms Stuart-Cole - who won a best actress prize for her role in An Inspector Calls and also starred in the stage productions of The Graduate and Calendar Girls - said she was 'ecstatic' after Conway was jailed found guilty of three counts of assault. Conway was jailed for 20 weeks after the judge said he showed 'consistent violence' towards Ms Stuart-Cole and did not have a shred of remorse. Speaking after the conviction, Ms Stuart-Cole said: 'We were planning our wedding and I thought I was in love with him but he turned into a nutter and just changed. It was like a coin flipped over and he became a different person. 'He was jealous and possessive and he even didn't want me to do the scenes in the Hitchcock Blonde play as they are of a quite explicit nature. 'During another show he was vile to me and I had bruises on my arms. Luckily I was wearing long gloves in the show so nobody could see the bruises.' The builder, from Sale, Manchester (pictured  outside Trafford Magistrates' Court) has been jailed for 20 weeks for three counts of assault against the actress . During his trial at Trafford Magistrates' Court, the court heard how Conway punched, throttled and kicked his bride-to-be during a series of attacks. In the first incident, he lifted up Ms Stuart-Cole as she sat at her desk when he believed she was browsing dating websites. He then dragged her to the kitchen where he grabbed her throat with such force that she was left with finger marks across her neck. He also kicked her while she lay helpless on the floor, the court was told. Prosecutor Annabelle Hartley said that, on another occasion, Conway lunged at Ms Stuart-Cole while she was running upstairs and followed her into the bedroom. The judge said the attacks on Ms Stuart-Cole amounted to 'consistent violence' The court heard he then pushed her onto the bed and grabbed her by the jaw, causing red marks. He also punched her in the arm. During the third attack, Conway kicked Ms Stuart-Cole while they were having an argument on the sofa, leaving bruises on her thigh. The court heard Ms Stuart-Cole had called the police twice previously to report the attacks but  withdrew her statement on each occasion. But, after the third attack, Ms Stuart-Cole broke off the relationship and went on to give evidence against Conway. A day after the last attack, she also posted on Facebook saying: 'I'm still standing folks. And always will.' Later, in a statement given to police, she said the attacks have left her a frightened woman with a deep distrust of men who is now 'ridiculously sensitive' to any sudden noise. She said: 'I was constantly looking behind me and if I was on my own and there was a loud noise I would jump. 'If I heard footsteps I was panicking and I wasn't sleeping. It was horrible and the stress has a horrible effect on you... It makes you paranoid and all this has left me with a distrust of men. 'I also have very graphic nightmares and have become ridiculously sensitive to any noise I hear.' The court heard how Conway and Ms Stuart-Cole had been in a relationship for one year after meeting in a pub in July 2012. He proposed in February last year. Ms Stuart-Cole said: 'He was charming and generous but almost too charming - always buying rounds for everybody and showering me with gifts. 'The first time he went mad was when I was sending an innocent message to an ex-boyfriend. He chased me up the stairs and threw me on the bed and pinned me down. He had one hand round my throat and was yelling over nothing. 'I used to find myself apologising and would smooth it over and sometimes he would apologise and say he was stressed and say he was sorry. 'But other times he wouldn't accept he was in the wrong. It's really hard when someone you love slaps you and is horrible.' She added: 'We broke up in November last year. We had been to a funeral and he was staying here and he kicked me really hard. 'I started crying and said ""stop doing that""and he stormed off. For days after we finished I could barely go down to the bins and would have to lock the door behind me. Conway who plans to appeal against his conviction, denied wrongdoing. His lawyer Miss Rachel Good said: 'It's sad when a relationship comes to an end but is clear there has been no contact since last year. 'He is under no illusions as to how matters of domestic violence are looked upon in these courts.' Sentencing, JP David Collins said: 'This was consistent violence on three separate occasions. The violence occurred in the victim's home and we have heard about the impact it has had on her. You have showed no remorse.' The actress said: 'People say I'm a strong person but I don't think I am. I'm just ecstatic he's gone to prison because it's definitely what he deserves and hopefully it will stop him doing it to anybody else. He is a nasty man. 'To anyone suffering domestic violence I would say absolutely get the hell out and don't listen to a word of their excuses.' As well as his jail sentence, Conway was ordered to pay her £400 compensation and banned from contacting her for two years.","Beverley Stuart-Cole, 48, was repeatedly beaten by builder Paul Conway, 46 .

"This poignant footage from space shows smoke rising from New York's Twin Towers, moments after two planes smashed into them in the terror attack which killed thousands of people. The haunting photos and video, shown in full for the first time today on MailOnline, were shot by American astronaut Frank Culbertson as he looked down helplessly on New York on September 11, 2001. He said his first instinct was to grab a camera - and hours later he would discover a close friend, a pilot at the controls of one of the hijacked planes, was one of the dead. Emotional: The footage, to be aired on Channel 4, was taken from space by U.S. astronaut Frank Culbertson as he orbited helplessly above New York. He later learned a good friend was one of the pilots killed in the attack . Far-reaching: A plume of smoke can be seen streaming from the World Trade Center on 9/11 in this image taken by astronaut Frank Culbertson, who was in space . Ground level: This was the scene on the ground as New York's emergency services battled fearlessly to save the thousands of people still trapped inside . The images emerged as part of research for a television series about astronauts and will be shown for the first time in the UK as part of Channel 4's Live From Space season. Culbertson made the recording as the huge plume of smoke from the towers drifted across the city, only learning a few hours afterwards that his friend, Chic Burlingame, had been one of the pilots killed that day when his plane was flown into the Pentagon. He responded by playing the Taps bugle call - which signals the end of the day for US military personnel - on a trumpet in a poignant tribute to his friend. In a public message to his countrymen, he wrote the following day: ‘It's horrible to see smoke pouring from wounds in your own country from such a fantastic vantage point. ‘The dichotomy of being on a spacecraft dedicated to improving life on the Earth and watching life being destroyed by such wilful, terrible acts is jolting to the psyche, no matter who you are.’ Tribute: Frank Culberton plays Taps on his bugle on September 16, 2001, to honor his friend Chic Burlingame who was killed in the attacks . Historic: Astronaut Frank Culbertson filmed the aftermath of the terror attack in New York while in space . Culbertson explained that upon learning of the attacks he rushed around the station until he found a window that would give him a view of New York and grabbed the nearest camera. He said: ‘It's difficult to describe how it feels to be the only American completely off the planet at a time such as this. The feeling that I should be there with all of you, dealing with this, helping in some way, is overwhelming.’ The channel’s Live From Space season . next week will feature documentaries about astronauts, building up to a . two-and-a-half-hour live broadcast from the ISS and Mission Control in . Houston, Texas, which will feature a full 90-minute orbit of Earth. Victim: Pilot Charles 'Chic' Burlingame was killed in the 9/11 attack at the Pentagon . Short clips from the film of the . attacks on New York were released by Nasa to mark the tenth anniversary . in 2011, but the film has not been seen in full with Culbertson’s . commentary and bugle call. Creative . director of the Channel 4 project, Tom Brisley, said: 'Not every frame . has been seen before, so every frame that was shot on that day is in the . show.' Executive producer Sally Dixon said: 'It’s the first time we have had it in that form with Frank talking us through it. 'If that had been in a movie you’d have gone, ""oh come on, that guy’s got a trumpet?"". But reality is stranger than fiction sometimes.' It will feature in the documentary Astronauts: Houston We Have A Problem for which program-makers have been given access to Nasa footage of some of the difficulties in space over the years. They include film of Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, who was close to drowning when his helmet filled with water during a space walk, causing colleagues to fear for his life. During other filming for the documentary - to be screened on March 13 - there was a real-life emergency on the station when a cooling system failed, forcing the crew to make two space walks to fix it. During the show, American astronaut Frank Culbertson, recalled how he saw smoke rising from New York's Twin Towers while onboard the ISS in 2001. This image from the Landsat satellite shows smoke still rising at 11.30am on September 12 . Space view: An image from a Nasa satellite also captured the plume of smoke coming from the World Trade Center . Dixon said: 'Suddenly a valve went on a coolant pump outside and they had to shut down power to half the station to power down a lot of equipment, so we were there filming our general stuff and they let us in on meetings of all these various teams. 'They work out how will they do the space walk, people are practicing in the big pool with a model of the space station underwater because it’s very like microgravity. 'It was just an amazing coincidence that we happened to be filming - no space walks were filmed for Rick [Mastracchio], Koichi [Wakata] and Mike’s [Hopkins] mission. It was incredible to see the teamwork that went on to work out what needed to be done and how they would do it. The live program, Live From Space: Lap Of the Planet, will be screened on March 16, and presented by Dermot O’Leary and veteran astronaut Mike Massimino, who helped fix the Hubble telescope.

"Britain's most senior police officer yesterday warned that Right-wing extremists could 'hijack' vigilante patrols protecting against looters. Acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner Tim Godwin singled out the English Defence League and the British National Party as two organisations who might exploit the situation. His warning comes amid intelligence that the EDL has successfully infiltrated vigilante groups in Enfield, North London – scene of some of the worst mindless violence and criminality on Sunday night – and Eltham in South East London. Extremists: A police officer directs men off the street as vigilantes were joined by members of the EDL on a march through Enfield, north London . Protest: Vigilantes run through the streets of Enfield on Tuesday night. Police accused them of diverting resources away from other communities . Police warn the potential for this to 'fuel the flames' of an already fraught situation by adding a 'violent racial element' is 'enormous and worrying.' Residents claimed some English Defence League supporters were involved in organising vigilante patrols of young white men under the name Enfield Defence League on Tuesday night. They split into three 30-strong groups in contact by mobile telephone and BlackBerry to patrol the streets. Underlining police concerns, the EDL said yesterday: 'Supporters have taken to the streets to help defend their communities and prepare for the clean-up operations that must follow the last few days of rioting and looting. 'We already have members organising themselves in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Norwich and Birmingham, and are also looking to organise efforts in Bristol, Leeds, Wolverhampton, Salford, Nottingham, Leicester and Hull.' Drain on resources: Police officers detain a man in Eltham, south London, on Tuesday night, where members of the EDL had gathered to act as anti-riot 'vigilantes' Mobs: A police van is patrols the streets in Eltham, south-east London, as vigilantes mill around waiting for looters to appear . Hundreds of police officers descended on a London suburb last night to disperse about 60 men who claimed to be protecting shops and businesses there for a second night. The men, apparently supporters of the extreme-right English Defence League, gathered in a pedestrianised square in Eltham drinking cans of beer and chanting 'We love you England'. With shops and pubs in the high street shut, the group – white men aged in their 20s to 50s – brought carrier bags with beer in them and drank and sat on benches. But around 300 police officers flooded the high street, surrounding the group. Around 8.30pm, the order was given to disperse the group of EDL supporters – and youths who had arrived to see what was going on. Officers moved in to shepherd the group away from the square, known as Passey Place, and out of the town down Eltham Hill. It was reported that some bottles were thrown at the police. The presence of the EDL in Eltham has been condemned by local politicians. Eltham MP Clive Efford, a shadow home office spokesman said: 'The English Defence League just want to put a sinister racial twist on this. 'All these police resources for what? To deal with the English Defence League? That's appalling. These police officers could be used elsewhere, protecting communities across London, but they have got to be in here to deal with these drunken yobs who have decided to come to Eltham and cause racial tension.' On Tuesday night around 50 members of the group joined with 150 to 200 locals to protect Eltham from looters they claimed were expected to try to attack the area. They tried to march towards Lewisham – hit by rioting on Monday night – but were pushed back towards Eltham by police and dispersed around 11.30pm. There were no arrests and no reports of damage. Speaking as he toured Enfield . yesterday, Mr Godwin said: 'I am worried that there are groups out there . like the EDL and BNP who are trying to hijack this and cause more . tensions in the community. They are politically motivated groups who . have another agenda.' He . added: 'I have not got a problem with community groups protecting their . property or places of worship, which wasn't needed in the end.' But . he warned: 'The police will arrest anyone committing a criminal act, . whether they are looting or vigilantes breaking the law.' The Met's Deputy Assistant  Commissioner Steve Kavanagh echoed those warnings yesterday, saying: 'What I don't need is these so-called vigilantes, who appeared to have been drinking too much, taking policing resources away from what they should have been doing – which is preventing the looting.' He spoke out after hundreds of residents in several London areas joined together to drive off would-be looters. Some groups had armed themselves with lengths of pipe and baseball bats, while some shopkeepers had knives in their stores, claiming that police were 'nowhere to be seen' and had 'failed' them during the first three days of violence. Sikh men armed with hockey sticks and metal bars were on guard yesterday in both West London and West Bromwich and stressed they were there with the 'full knowledge' of police. Yesterday, the EDL said: 'We are hoping to safeguard local businesses through a strong physical presence, and discourage trouble-makers from gathering in our town and city centres. 'The EDL, and all decent people, be they black, white, Christian, Sikh, Jewish or Muslim, are sickened by this mindless, selfish and ultimately self-defeating behaviour.' But Searchlight, the anti-fascist organisation, expressed deep concern last night at the EDL involvement, saying: 'The news that the EDL is promising to come out on the streets to defend our communities from rioters should be met with the derision and contempt it deserves. 'The EDL is the last thing our communities need.'","EDL and BNP singled out as extremist groups who may try to inflame racial tension .

"An Australian naval officer appears to have taken on board the old adage of having a girl at every port. A young man who was in Auckland for a few days recently, wrote postcards to women all around the world, according to The New Zealand Herald. Known only as Gav, staff at a cafe he regularly visited during his stay in the city assumed the sailor to be in his twenties. Eight lucky ladies around the world have postcards on the way to them from an Australian sailor with a lot of love to give . He travelled on an Australian Navy ship the HMAS Choules, a vessel formerly known as the Largs Bay when it served as part of the Royal Fleet Auxillary. On the day of his ships' departure, it is reported the casanova handed a stack of postcards to the owner of Barabra Cafe, Steaffan Ljunggren. 'His ship was leaving ... He nicely asked us 'oh, could you please do [me] a favour, would you mail this for me', owner Mr Ljunggren told the publication. The postcards were handed to the owner of a cafe, Steaffan Ljunggren (believed to be pictured) who sent them on their way . After taking a peek at the postcards, staff found that amongst the letters to family and friends, there were eight which appeared to be love letters. Women from Germany, Russia, Latvia and the Ukraine were all being written to with similar sign-offs, ending with the sailor professing his longing and love for each lucky lady. Many of the short letters finish with 'I miss you', 'I love you' and describe Auckland as a 'small and peaceful city' which reminds him of Sydney. The casanova's ship was docked at the Princes Wharf in Auckland when he penned his postcards . In one postcard addressed to Yana, Gav wrote 'I wish we could do some exploring together here', while another to Tatiana echoes a similar sentiment with 'I wish you were here with me to explore'. The postcards were sent on their way, and the naval officer's eight love letters are now sailing the seven seas to each of their special recipients. Gav's ship was at port at Princes Wharf, a former commercial wharf which has been developed and now houses cruise ships and the likes when they're passing through. The cafe - Barabra - which means 'all good' in Swedish, is situated right on the water, very close to where the HMAS Choules was docked.","Man known as Gav handed postcards to cafe staff to send for him .

"Wind farms have been paid a record £30million this year to stand idle in bad weather. The cash, which comes from household bills, is paid when the National Grid is unable to cope with the extra power produced during high winds, or during periods of low demand. The ‘constraint payments’ have reached £30,424,169 this year, compared with last year’s £5million. Wind farms have been paid £30million this year to shut down in bad weather . In just one weekend at the start of September, around 40 wind farm firms were paid £2.4million to switch off. The energy they would have produced in that time could have powered up to 10,000 homes. Another windy weekend in August saw £3.1million handed to energy firms for doing absolutely nothing. Up to 30 wind farms were paid. John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation charity, which compiled the figures from official data, said: ‘The scale and pricing of wind power constraints in 2013 clearly shows that the full system cost of wind power is much higher than government is willing to admit. ‘Unfortunately, there are no cheap solutions, and, ironically, paying wind farms not to produce energy may actually be cheaper than building more grid. ‘At some point government will have to face the fact that wind power is simply too expensive to provide more than a minor share of UK electricity.’ Under EU law, Britain’s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020 – meaning thousands more wind turbines may be built. There are already 4,000 on land and a further 1,000 at sea. Onshore wind farm turbines next to the coal fired Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire . Wind farms – especially those offshore – are heavily subsidised, with ministers saying turbines need public support to help them ‘scale up’. But Peter Lilley, a Tory MP on the Commons energy and climate change committee, said: ‘Paying wind farm operators not to produce electricity adds insult to injury. It’s an added problem that enthusiasts for wind farms tend to ignore and will increase proportionally the greater the number of wind turbines we subsidise by taking money from the pockets of poor people to subsidise rich landowners.’ National Grid said the payments had been higher than in previous years, partly due to weather conditions, but those paid to wind farms only made up a small proportion of all constraint payments. A spokesman said: ‘National Grid balances the country’s demand and supply minute by minute, and it transports electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed. It can ask generators to come on or off the grid to manage constraints and keep the system balanced. ‘National Grid has a number of tools at its disposal to do that and is incentivised to keep balancing costs down. ‘The number and relative value of constraint payments made to wind farms is small compared to overall constraint payments made to generators of all types.’","National Grid is unable to cope with extra power produced .

"The lazy, laid back stereotype of Australian workers has been officially debunked. A new study looking into work life balance of the average Australian employee has found that Aussies regularly work overtime without being paid, with the 'donated' hours adding up to $110 billion every year. 'On average full-time workers reported working six hours unpaid overtime each week and part-timers, three hours,' The Australian Institute's study, Walking The Tightrope, states. The Australian Institute's study, Walking The Tightrope, found that the average Australain worker donates $9,471 in unpaid overtime to their employers each year . 'This donated contribution adds up to 1.13 million hours or $2.1 billion – a week. 'The average worker donates $9,471 in unpaid overtime to their employers each year, which adds up to $109.8 billion across the workforce.' The research, which was conducted to help promote Go Home On Time Day on November 19, resolved that the nation has a 'culture of overtime' that far exceeds that of other countries, with 14.7 per cent of all hours worked being unpaid. 'If these donated hours were allocated to and paid to Australians looking for work the unemployment rate could be zero rather than 6.2 per cent,' the study states. The average working week of Australia's full-time employees is 42.8 hours, ranking it at ninth place amongst OECD countries . A portion of the results are based on a survey of almost 2000 Australians, 42 per cent of which admitted their work/life balance had worsened over the last five years. When asked why they thought that was, the most common response was 'longer working hours', which was given by 46 per cent of people while 'job insecurity' was chosen by 27 per cent of respondents. Participants named 'more flexible hours', 'fixed finishing times' and 'renegotiating hours' as the changes they were willing to make to improve the balance between work and life, while three quarters of respondents admitted they would not give up their pay.

'Those [long] hours may constitute a health problem with regard to stress and [participation] in physical activity.

"Little Levi Blu Cassin (pictured), 22 months, had suffered 'major internal injuries' as a result of 'significant' blows to his tiny body, the court heard . A mother and father murdered their 22-month-old son by stamping and beating him with such ferocity the child's small intestine split in two, a court heard. Toddler Levi Blu Cassin  suffered 'catastrophic' internal injuries similar to someone who had been hit by a CAR or fallen from a three-storey building. He died after being discovered by paramedics at his mum's address in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, on the morning of February 20 last year. His parents Danielle Cassin, 27, and Mark Piper, 31, are on trial at Birmingham Crown Court charged with murder and child cruelty. The court heard Cassin phoned for an ambulance after her son stopped breathing at around 4.30am on the morning of his death. Paramedics arrived at the couple's flat to find Levi lying on the floor between the cot and his mother's bed. Prosecutor Timothy Raggatt QC said the child's eyes were open but his lips had turned blue and he had no pulse. He was rushed to hospital on blue lights but was pronounced dead at around 5.30am. A post-mortem examination revealed Levi died from 'major internal injuries' - with his small intestine split in two - as a result of 'significant' blows to the body. Mr Raggatt told the court the  toddler could have been punched in an upright position several times. But he said the more likely scenario was that Levi was lying on the floor and had been stamped on either once or repeatedly. Mr Raggatt said the only two people who could have inflicted the fatal injuries were the boy's parents. Danielle Cassin, 27, pictured with her son Levi is on trial at Birmingham Crown Court accused of the murder of the 22 month old . The child's father, Mark Piper, 31, pictured with the toddler, is also in the dock at Birmingham Crown Court . He added: 'This case is about the death of a 22-month-old boy. It is the death of a child through quite extreme violence and is going to be quite emotive. 'Danielle took a sheet to her mother's the night before Levi died, and asked her mother if she thought the stains on the blanket could be Levi's stomach lining. 'Her mother said she thought the marks were just phlegm, and Danielle went home between 9-10pm, having only told her mother that Levi was 'unwell'. 'There is then a period of time in which only the two people sitting in the dock know what happened. 'We do not know what happened in the latter part of that evening until the 999 call the next morning. 'Both parents have persistently declined to tell the truth about what happened during that time. 'But Levi died as a result of abdominal injuries. They were very significant, major internal injuries. 'The totality of the injuries was so severe that they could not have happened by accident, they are the result of at least one very substantial blow to the abdomen and maybe more. 'The injury was sustained at least six hours, and maybe up to 12 hours, before the 999 call was put in asking for assistance. 'The defendants are charged jointly with murder because this has to have occurred as a result of cooperation between the two of them. 'It was a joint enterprise. One person can do the damage, but if the other supports or connives then they are guilty too. 'Levi died as the result of the intentional joint actions of both defendants. 'Both parents are yet to tell the truth so we simply do not know why this happened, and we may never know.' A post mortem revealed the tot had suffered an earlier abdominal injury that had started to heal around two weeks before his death. Cassin dramatically left the dock in tears as the graphic details of Levi's injuries were pointed out on a diagram to jurors. Piper, of Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, and Cassin, of Chelmsley Wood, Birmingham, are also accused of neglect and causing or allowing the death of a child. Cassin's mother Angela broke down in tears as she told the jury how her daughter had visited her the day before 'smiley happy' Levi died. She said: 'She (Cassin) came round at about 9pm. I was in the living room, the telly was on and the children were in bed. 'Danielle said that he had a stomach ache because he was vomiting. 'She was rushed. She did not stay for a long time. 'She had a screwed-up mattress cover with her. She asked me if it was stomach lining on it. 'I know it was from a cot. 'I said 'don't be so stupid' because I have never heard of anyone bringing up stomach lining before. 'Levi had been sick. 'There was a patch of what looked like sick and a little blob of clear phlegm on the mattress. 'I just said 'make sure he drinks lots of liquid. There is a bug going around.' 'The next I heard from her was about 5.30am on the phone, saying he was dead.' 'I saw him dead in the hospital. 'Levi was very much loved. He was a smiley, happy boy.'

"As she lay drenched in blood and . dying on the sidewalk after being stabbed 32 times by her boyfriend, . little did she know it was to be the beginning of her fairytale. Melissa Dohme, from Clearwater, Florida, was just 20-years-old when Robert Lee Burton Jr slashed her hands, arms, face and head outside her home, the attack only stopped by a passing couple. Clearwater firefighter-paramedic . Cameron Hill, 38, responded to the 911 call, which he said was the . goriest of his 17-year career. Scroll down for video . Fate: Melissa Dohme and Cameron Hill were brought together after he was the paramedic on the scene when she was stabbed 32 times by her ex-boyfriend . Melissa was in the hospital for three weeks: She flat lined four times, received 12 units of blood, suffered a stroke that affected her balance and the left side of her face was paralysed . Head over heels: Cameron did not know what to do but . could not get the young woman he rescued out of his head. He . eventually asked her out and ever since their first date the pair have . been inseparable . Love: Melissa Dohme was saved by Cameron Hill, second left, who said he instantly connected with her, even though he couldn't see her face, couldn't tell if she was blond because of the blood and didn't know her name . Though he couldn't see her face, . couldn't tell if she was blond because of the blood and didn't know her . name, a strange feeling came over him and he said he knew in his heart . he was going to see her again. Melissa ended up being in the hospital for three weeks. She flat lined four times, received 12 units of blood and suffered a stroke that affected her balance, according to The Tampa Bay Times. A severed nerve partly paralyzed the left side of her face. Guilty plea: Robert Burton was in court on Tuesday . Though doctors did not know if she . would speak smile or walk again, she made a remarkable recovery and left . rehab without a cane. She became determined to reach out to all those who helped save her and to tell her story to others. After a trip to Europe with her girlfriends, she returned determined to become a nurse. For a time, she spoke to everyone - except the firefighter-paramedics from Clearwater Station 47. In October last year when Melissa was speaking at a Clearwater church, two of her first responders surprised her - one of whom was Cameron. After hugging and crying and exchanging numbers, Melissa said: 'I was weirdly giddy. I had this feeling about him.' When they met up again, she said she . felt she was in the grasp of a full-blown crush, according to Tampa Bay . Times as they talked easily and naturally. Cameron did not know what to do but . could not get the young woman he rescued out of his head. But he . eventually asked her out and ever since their first date the pair have . been inseparable. Last week, the couple attended the pretrial hearing in the first-degree attempted murder case against her ex-boyfriend Robert Burton. She testified that he would hit and shove her before allegedly stabbing her in January last year. Though she almost lost her life and it was a traumatic and life-changing experience, Melissa would not change it. Survivor: Melissa Dohme was stabbed in the face and neck more than 32 times, but her scars are quickly fading; the picture on the right shows how her scars have healed in a two-month span . Emotional: Cameron Hill breaks down in tears as he recalls the sight of his girlfriend lying on the sidewalk drenched in blood . Support: Melissa pictured with her mother Joann at church in Clearwater . 'When . I look back on that night, I can't think of it as all bad anymore . because I met Cameron,' she said. 'He's the one I've been waiting for. My fairy tale.' On the night of the attack, Burton . had been calling and texting Melissa requesting a hug - however, when . she met him to talk, she said she heard a click, and then sharp pain in . her neck, where he allegedly embedded his knife. Ms Dohme met Burton at Clearwater High School, and the couple dated for nearly two years. However, things took a violent turn when Burton allegedly attacked her outside Ms Dohme’s house last October. Court documents allege that he pulled her hair and punched her repeatedly. The couple broke up soon after. But Burton called and texted the petite blonde over and over on January 24, saying he needed to see her, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Ms Dohme told the Times that she initially ignored him and told Burton that she had class early the next day – it was, after all, around 2:30am. She agreed to see him when he said he was near her house, around 3am. He said he only needed a hug. Even so, Ms Dohme took pepper spray with her. According to court documents, Burton asked for a hug, and then began stabbing her in the face and neck. During the attack, she was screaming as loud as she could, hoping someone would hear. A young couple who did not want to be publicly identified happened to be in Crest Lake Park. Recovery: She suffered a slash to the right side . of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid . artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out . Roving: Ms Dohme, pictured before the attack, still has a long road ahead of her . Law and order: Ms Dohme wrote: 'Ran into these two great men tonight, detectives Ruhlin and Sena! These are the ones working on my case and were able to get the jerk (putting it nicely) to confess his guilt' According to a police report, the couple – who are both in their late teens – yelled at Burton to stop and said he was going to kill her. The man attempted to push the 245-pound Burton off of Ms Dohme, but was unable to. Meanwhile, the young woman tried to help Ms Dohme escape to safety and called 911. Ms Dohme told the Tampa Bay Times that the couple’s intervention likely saved her live. '(Burton) would have stabbed me 'til I was dead', she told the Times. 'I know it's a miracle that I am still here. Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.' The couple left, and Burton had allegedly gone back to his truck to retrieve a bigger knife. Ms Dohme had lost pints of blood already, and was fading. Burton was later found after he crashed his car some distance away. He was believed to have overdosed on sleeping pills. Doctors rushed her to Bayfront, where she underwent several surgeries, and was given 12 units of blood. She suffered a slash to the right side of her face that severed a nerve. The knife also grazed her carotid artery, which meant she was in serious danger of bleeding out. Ms Dohme later counted 32 stab wounds, 18 of which were deep. ‘I know it’s a miracle that I am still here,’ she told Bay News 9 in an interview earlier this month. ‘Even the trauma doctor in his notes wrote, nothing short of miraculous.’ But her fighting spirit, as well as her faith helped her persevere. ‘He didn’t win and I won,’ she told the Times. Within days of the near-lethal attack, . Ms Dohme was able to breathe on her own, could grasp a pencil, and could . walk down the hallways of the ICU . She had to regularly attend speech therapy and get check-ups with other specialists. Remarkably, she went home three weeks later, and finished out her classes at St Petersburg College, earning A’s in her Humanities and Sociology classes. Burton faces assault charges in addition to first-degree attempted murder charges. Ms Dohme hasn’t let the injury slow her down. Though she completes seven hours of rehab weekly, she continues to be the bright, smiling young woman she was before the attack. She is currently backpacking through Europe with a few girlfriends, and has received an outpouring of support from friends and family. Her brush with death hasn’t stopped her from pursuing her dream – becoming a neo-natal nurse. And more than anything, nearly losing everything has shown her a new appreciation for the small tings. ‘I’ve never loved life so much, I’ve never been so appreciative, I really appreciate every day,’ she told Bay News 9.","Melissa Dohme was allegedly stabbed more than 30 times in her face and neck in January by her ex-boyfriend .

"A 73-year-old man has miraculously escaped with cuts and bruises after his light aircraft crashed through the roof of a bungalow in Leicestershire. The pilot of the small aeroplane had to be freed from the wreckage by emergency crews after his aircraft came down on the farm building outside Castle Bytham, south of Grantham, just after 2pm. The 61-year-old occupant of the property also escaped unscathed as he was outside the property signing for a delivery from a tanker driver, 52, at the time of the crash. Witnesses said the homeowner and the driver 'dived out of the way' as the plane made its crash landing. Scroll down for video . The light aircraft crashed through the roof of a bungalow at a farm on the outskirts of Castle Bytham in Leicestershire just after 2pm. The pilot, 73, had to be freed from the wreckage but escaped with bruises . The 61-year-old occupant of the rural farm property also escaped unscathed as he was outside the bungalow signing for a delivery from a tanker driver, 52, at the time of the crash. The delivery driver suffered from shock . Police said the homeowner was uninjured while the delivery driver was taken to hospital with minor cuts and bruises and to be treated for shock. It is not known at this stage what caused the light aircraft to crash, but an investigation is set to be launched by the Civil Aviation Authority. A private landing strip situated behind the farm property is often used by civilian light aircraft and it is believed the man may have been doing circuit practice in the area at the time of the crash. Police said the pilot, from Thurnby, Leicestershire, had been taken to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham by air ambulance but confirmed his injuries were non life-threatening. He was freed from the wreckage by fire crews. Pete Wiles, from Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said the homeowner pushed the delivery driver out of the way and to safety after realising the aircraft was making a crash landing. He said: 'The occupant of the bungalow and a fuel delivery driver were in the garden. They were just finishing off the delivery and noticed the aircraft coming over the hill. 'I understand the occupant pushed the tanker driver out of the way and in doing that he moved out of the way as well. 'In the process of being pushed, the tanker driver sustained a cut to the chin. 'If they hadn't moved... they would have been hit. 'It could have been far more serious than it actually was and there could have been three people killed or seriously injured.' He added that the trio had a 'fairly miraculous escape', and said the plane narrowly missed an overhead power line nearby. The plane crashed in rural Leicestershire, near to a private landing strip often used by civilian light aircrafts . Chris Wright, a neighbour who lives about one mile away, said he drove past the incident just after it happened. The self-employed 63-year-old said: 'It landed on the roof and it's just stuck there. Apparently the front wheel went through into the front bedroom. 'I believe he was doing circuit practice at the time, he wasn't able to control it for whatever reason and landed on the roof. 'It's not something you see every day. 'There was obviously a problem but fortunately everyone was OK.' He said the the homeowner and the delivery driver were chatting outside the property when the plane crashed through the building. He said: 'They were talking outside and saw it coming and dived for cover. 'The funny thing was that the oil delivery man was just asking if there were ever any problems with the nearby airfield, and then this happened. 'I saw the plane on the roof of the bungalow and one of the wheels was through the roof and landed on the man's bed. 'I saw both men afterwards and the guy who lives in the bungalow was a bit shaken up, obviously. The pilot, from Thurnby, Leicestershire, was taken to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham by air ambulance . 'The delivery driver was in the ambulance and had blood on his face. I think he was hurt when the other man pushed him down. 'The pilot was being treated by ambulance men.' He said the private grass landing strip, about 15-yards from the bungalow, was known locally as Castle Bytham airfield. Officers confirmed the bungalow, which is situated on a farm, did not suffer major structural damage but the area has been cordoned off for public safety. East Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed an air ambulance, three ambulance and four response paramedics were deployed to the scene. Emergency services remain at the scene to ensure the crashed plane and its fuel tank are contained and pose no danger. The road remains closed at Counthorpe Lane at this time and a full investigation is expected to be carried out to determine the circumstances surrounding the crash. Anyone with information should contact Lincolnshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 244 of November 19.","Pilot, 73, survived light aircraft crashing through bungalow just after 2pm .

But Mr Mawe, who was discovered in the road by his own mother, walked away from the crash with a severely broken right arm and just a scratch on his head. The rider has now had the final operation to repair his damaged arm - and is preparing to get back on his bike for the first time since the horror smash. He said: ‘I don’t remember the accident itself, but it went over my arm first, hit my elbow, and then crushed my helmet when it went over my head. There was nothing left of my helmet. ‘It was a fully-laden lorry at the time and the driver said it would have weighed about 30 tonnes. 'He got out and was like, “Oh my God, I’ve run over this guy, there’s going to be nothing left”. But I was conscious. Apparently I was screaming and shouting and swearing. I do feel really lucky.’ Mr Mawe was riding his 125cc Suzuki Epicuro when he rounded a blind bed and crashed into a static car in March 2009. Badly injured: Photos taken by Mr Mawe as he recovered from surgery after he was run over by the lorry . Stitches: Mr Mawe's arm is pictured as he was treated by surgeons in hospital following the lorry accident . A shocked passer-by called an ambulance which took him to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, just after his mother Jenny, 45, arrived with his older brother Lee, 26. Medics initially feared they would have to amputate his arm - but, after finding a pulse, patched it back together with three titanium pins and skin grafts from his leg during a series of operations. He spent three weeks in hospital and returned to college two months later. But his arm snapped again when one of the pins failed, and he had to have some bone from his hip inserted into his upper arm a year after the accident. He had a final operation to remove a pin from his elbow just last year. ‘There was this really sharp corner on a really narrow road and some guy ahead of me stopped to let the lorry go past,’ said Mr Mawe, who is now studying at the University of East Anglia. This scrap metal lorry crushed Mr Mawe's arm into a dozen pieces before ripping his helmet from his head . X-rays: The rider has now had the final operation to repair his damaged arm - and is preparing to get back on his bike for the first time since the horror smash . ‘I put my brakes on at the last minute and went into the back of the car, and fell sideways into the path of this huge lorry. ‘There was a huge gouge in the side of my arm that was so hard to pull together - it was so stretched out. They had to take a skin graft from my inside leg. ‘The bottom part of the arm was broken and the top part was really badly broken too, and my elbow was in eight pieces, but despite being run over by a lorry there was nothing wrong with my head. I do feel lucky, really lucky not to have lost my arm. 'There was a point where they couldn’t find a pulse for quite a while and they were in two minds about whether they should take it off or continue.’ ‘I haven’t been back on a bike since, but I do miss it. My brother has bought himself a proper 1000cc motorbike and him and my dad are planning a trip across Europe next summer. ‘I would feel pretty rubbish being at home while they are doing that. I do fancy getting back on it now. I just have to get my confidence back up.’","Jason Mawe, 25, was riding from home in Reepham, Norfolk, to college .

"British companies sold chemicals to Syria that could have been used to produce the deadly nerve agent that killed 1,400 people, The Mail on Sunday can reveal today. Between July 2004 and May 2010 the Government issued five export licences to two companies, allowing them to sell Syria sodium fluoride, which is used to make sarin. The Government last night admitted for the first time that the chemical was delivered to Syria – a clear breach of international protocol on the trade of dangerous substances that has been condemned as ‘grossly irresponsible’. Scroll down for video . A Syrian man mourns over a dead body after an alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces. It has emerged that British companies sold the Syrian regime a key ingredient in the manufacture of sarin gas . The sales were made at a time when President Bashar Assad was strongly suspected to be stockpiling the chemical weapons that have caused an international crisis. The UK firms delivered sodium fluoride to a  Syrian cosmetics company for what they claim were legitimate purposes. But intelligence experts believe President Assad’s regime uses such companies to divert chemicals into its weapons programme. Thomas Docherty MP, a member of the Commons Arms Export Controls Committee, said: ‘These are very disturbing revelations uncovered by The Mail on Sunday regarding the provision of sodium fluoride to Syria. At no time should we have allowed President Assad’s regime to get its hands on this substance. How the British chemicals aid Assad . ‘Previously we thought that while export licences had been granted, no chemicals were actually delivered. Now we know that in the build-up to the Syrian civil war, UK companies – with the backing of our Government – were supplying this potentially lethal substance. ‘While the last export licence was issued in May 2010, these licences are obtained prior to manufacture and the industry standard is for four to five months to pass before  the chemicals are delivered. 'So we are looking at late 2010 for the  British supplies of sodium fluoride reaching Syria. The Government has some very serious questions  to answer.’ Last week it was revealed that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) had granted export licences in 2012 – but they were not used to send sodium fluoride to Syria. The European Union subsequently banned exports outright. Prime Minister David Cameron (left) failed to secure support for military action against Syria. An intelligence expert says President Assad will have diverted sodium flouride to chemical weapons programmes . Last night the BIS refused to answer questions regarding how much sodium fluoride was bought and sold – or which companies were involved. Intelligence expert Richard Kemp, a former member of the Government’s COBRA emergency committee, said last night: ‘President Assad would undoubtedly have diverted legitimately exported supplies of sodium fluoride in order to make chemical weapons. ‘He would have absolutely no qualms about doing this, and his practice was well known to British diplomats and our intelligence agencies. In this light, it is grossly irresponsible of BIS to have approved these licences from 2004 to 2010.’ Scientists at the UK’s military research laboratory at Porton Down proved that sarin was used in the chemical attack on August 21 after testing items of clothing recovered from the scene. A Syrian army soldier walks on a street in the Jobar neighborhood of Damascus, Syria . The US says the attack, near Damascus, killed 1,429 people, including 426 children. And yesterday, EU officials meeting in Lithuania announced that they are convinced that the chemical attack was the work of President Assad’s forces rather than any opposition fighters. Last night a senior scientist condemned the sale, as Syria is one of just five countries to have refused to sign protocols against the use  of chemical weapons. The other nations not to have signed up to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) accords are North Korea, South Sudan, Egypt and Angola. Professor Alastair Hay, a toxicology expert at Leeds University, said: ‘The Government’s approval of sodium fluoride sales to Syria  during a period when it was widely suspected the regime was stockpiling dangerous substances is deeply disturbing. 'This was a serious mistake on BIS’s part as while sodium fluoride has a multitude of benign uses, such as toothpaste, it remains a key ingredient in the manufacture of sarin. Quite simply, you need fluoride to make sarin. A Free Syrian Army fighter carries the body of a fellow fighter during clashes in Aleppo last month . ‘Given Syria’s refusal to sign up to the OPCW’s regulations I cannot see any justification for these sales. Have we learned nothing since the 1990s? Back then sodium fluoride was sold by the UK to intermediaries buying the chemical for Iraq where Saddam Hussein gassed his own people.’ Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind also condemned the sale. He said: ‘When you have a dual-use chemical and one of the uses is for the construction of chemical weapons, as a general policy that should not be permitted for sale to any regime that is either known to have or might be interested in constructing chemical weapons or to a country that has failed to sign up to the international accords on the trade in restricted substances. ‘So in the case of these licences being awarded to sell sodium fluoride to Syria it sounds as if some serious errors were made.’ The BIS approved the sales of sodium fluoride to Syria on the basis that it was strictly for use in the cosmetics industry. But last night, a department spokesman said naming the firms involved in the trade would breach their client confidentiality. Sarin, which is made by combining the fluorine in sodium fluoride with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and phosphorous, is considered one of the world’s most dangerous chemical warfare agents. It disrupts the nervous system, over-stimulating muscles and vital organs. It is more than 500 times as toxic as cyanide. It can be inhaled as a gas or absorbed through the skin. In high doses, sarin suffocates its victims by paralysing the muscles around their lungs, and one drop can kill in minutes. Last night a BIS spokesman said: ‘The five licences were granted to two UK exporters. We cannot publish their names for reasons of commercial confidentiality. The end users were two Syrian commercial companies. 'The quantities of sodium fluoride involved were commensurate with the stated end use in the production of cosmetics and there was no reason to link them with Syria’s chemical weapons programme. This remains the case.’","British companies delivered sodium flouride to Syrian firm from 2004-2010 .

"iPhone users have been blissfully unaware that for the past year-and-a half they could have been the victim of 'hi-tech eavesdropping' iPhone users have been blissfully unaware that for approximately a year-and-a half a software bug could have made them the victims of ‘hi-tech eavesdropping’. Security experts have warned that past iterations of iOS software - dating from as long ago as September 2012 - had a vulnerability that hackers could have exploited to see financial transactions, emails and Facebook activity. They have advised iPhone users to download iOS 7.0.6 as quickly as possible, which was rolled out by Apple on Friday with a note about the patch. A release note explained that the company has fixed the bug in which ‘an attacker with a privileged network position may capture or modify data in sessions protected by SSL/TLS’. 'Secure Transport failed to validate the authenticity of the connection. This issue was addressed by restoring missing validation steps,' Apple said. Experts are trying to work out the exact iOS update the bug first appeared in, but it is thought that it cropped up around a year and a half ago. There have been no reports of hacks. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) ensures that communication between a browser and website servers are secure and Transport layer Security (TLS) is a newer way of doing the same thing, Gizmodo explained. While users might not be aware of them, SSL and TLS mean that a browser and server can recognise each other to keep financial transactions and log-in information safe. But iPhone and iPad users have not had the full benefit of this as the bug meant that Safari couldn’t recognise if the servers it was talking to were the valid account, leaving users open to what are known as ‘man in the middle’ attacks, or hi-tech eavesdropping. Security experts have warned that past iterations of iOS dating from as long ago as September 2012, had a vulnerability that hackers (illustrated) could exploit to see financial transactions, emails and Facebook activity . Experts suggest that anyone using an iOS device downloads 7.0.6 immediately. Gizmodo advised that anyone with an iPod touch downloads iOS 6.1.6 instead. There is currently no official fix for the vulnerability for OS X but Apple said one is coming 'very soon'. In the meantime experts suggest that MacBook users should use Google Chrome or Firefox to browse the web, which are not affected on OS X. They also say that secure networks should thwart any attempts by hackers to perform ‘man in the middle’ attacks. A man in the middle hacker can intercept the communication between a browser and website to see and record messages and financial transactions. Experts claim the Apple bug made it potentially easy for hackers to do just this – although it is not known whether the bug was exploited by anyone. One New-York based security expert, Jeffrey Grossman, wrote on Twitter that iPhone users have been susceptible to attacks since September 2012. Security experts have been cagey about revealing the ins and outs of the bug, but Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins cryptography professor in Baltimore, Maryland told Reuters: 'The bug is as bad as you can imagine’. Apple said: 'For the protection of our . customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues . until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or . releases are available.' Experts said Apple has now fixed the problem for iPhone and iPad users in its latest iOS 7.0.6 release, but some users have reported teething problems in downloading it. While it is not thought the problem is widespread, a handful of iPhone 5S and iPad Air owners took to Twitter to vent their anger about how their devices were unable to function during and after they installed the update on the move, Techienews reported. The bug also affects MacBooks' OS X and currently there is not yet a fix for the vulnerability. However, the California company told Reuters that a fix for Mac computers (pictured) will be available 'very soon' The SSL TSLS bug also affects MacBooks’ OS X and currently there is not yet an official fix for the vulnerability. However, the California company told Reuters that a patch for Mac computers will be available 'very soon'. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'We are aware of this issue and already have a software fix that will be released very soon.' It is not known how Apple found out about the vulnerability, which has presumably gone unnoticed for some time. Google engineer Adam Langley wrote on his personal blog that the flaw might not have shown up without complex and thorough testing. 'I believe that it's just a mistake and I feel very bad for whomever might have slipped,' he said.","Experts have advised iPhone users to download iOS 7.0.6 as quickly as possible, which was rolled out by Apple on Friday .

"Families worried that their elderly relatives are being abuse by care home staff are to be given official advice on how to secretly install CCTV cameras. Care home watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, will issue guidance in the New Year explaining how to best monitor staff. A spokeswoman told MailOnline the CQC 'understood that there are circumstances where some people will feel that is the right thing for them'. Crucial: Gladys Wright's son captured her abuse on CCTV. Daniel Baynes was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing the 79-year-old dementia sufferer . The decision to publish official guidance helping concerned families install cameras was signed off by the CQC's board today. It is hoped that the vigilance of family members will help to maintain high standards of care for elderly and vulnerable people. The advice will also be aimed at managers who suspect malpractice among their staff. The CQC's Chief Inspector Andrea Sutcliffe, said: 'We know that exploring the potential use of hidden and public cameras in care homes and other care settings is a really sensitive issue – and one that provokes a huge range of debate and opinion. 'The information we will publish for providers makes clear the issues we expect them to take into account – for example, consulting with people using the services and staff – if they are considering installing hidden or public cameras. 'I hope the information we will publish for the public will help them make the right decisions in difficult circumstances and I look forward to making sure that this information is written in a way that is most useful for them.' Smaller families, longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean the number of 'sandwich carers' who have to care for or arrange the care of their parents as well as their children is growing . But Ms Sutcliffe added: 'I am clear that any form of surveillance cannot be seen as the only way to ensure people are receiving safe, high-quality and compassionate care. We need enough staff, properly trained and supported who really care to ensure people get the services they have every right to expect.' Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb, said cameras had 'helped to expose terrible cruelty and neglectful care'. He said: 'I welcome this new information. Decisions about using surveillance are extremely difficult – there is always a balance to be struck between protecting people and respecting their right to privacy – but this information will help families to make the right choice for them. 'We are committed to preventing poor care from happening in the first place and have introduced tougher standards for inspecting care services as well as measures to shut down those that aren't up to scratch.' Faderera Grace Bello was jailed for carer ill treatment and wilful neglect after Veronica Davis secretly filmed Bello poking her mother Bridget Rees in the face . The information from the health watchdog comes after a string of scandals in care homes which were brought to light by relatives' undercover filming. In June Daniel Baynes was jailed for four months after he was caught abusing 79-year-old dementia sufferer Gladys Wright on a hidden camera installed by her son James. He and two colleagues, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow, were captured swearing at Mrs Wright and manhandling her at Granary Care Home, in Wraxall, North Somerset. A month later Faderera Grace Bello was jailed for carer ill treatment and wilful neglect after Veronica Davis secretly filmed Bello poking her mother Bridget Rees in the face. Dementia sufferer and former nurse Mrs Rees was left with bruises after the ill treatment at the NHS Mary Seacole Nursing Home in Hoxton, east London. Following the mistreatment Mrs Rees died in May aged 92. The news comes as a survey found that choosing care for an elderly parent is one of the most stressful decisions we will ever make. It ranks higher than getting married, choosing a school, getting divorced or buying a house in terms of worry. Smaller families, longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean the number of 'sandwich carers' who have to care for or arrange the care of their parents as well as their children is growing. An estimated 2.4million Britons now have to juggle their responsibilities for both parents and children. Some 84 per cent of the 259 men and women questioned by the poll, which was carried out by the CQC, said that deciding how to care for an elderly relative had been very stressful or quite stressful – making it the top choice. This decision could be about whether they are well enough to stay in their own home – or it could be about which care home will look after them best. Financial worries, fears over the standard of care and guilt about putting a relative into a home were all likely to contribute to the mental turmoil. And many people are forced to sell their parents' home to meet the high fees required to keep them in care. A care home worker was jailed and two of his colleagues received non-custodial sentences after they admitted ill-treating a 79-year-old dementia sufferer. Bristol Crown Court was shown video showing a distressed Gladys Wright being pushed, shoved and pulled on a number of occasions, while subjecting her to a tirade of verbal abuse. The camera had been secretly set up by her son, who had concerns about her treatment. Daniel Baynes, Tomasz Gidaszewski and Janusz Salnikow can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a 'nasty aggressive bitch' and telling each other to 'f*** her', throughout the recordings. The camera placed in Gladys Wright's room revealed an appalling catalogue of abuse by workers at the £800-a-week facility . On one occasion Baynes, 24, attempts to force Mrs Wright's eyes open, while on another pushes the clearly distressed pensioner onto the bed, while attempting to change her, before applying his weight on her legs to hold her down. Salnikow, 25, while changing Mrs Wright for bed, is shown to hold the nape of her neck before forcing her backwards into her chair by grabbing her chin. Her son James set the device up to reassure himself the treatment his mother was receiving in the specialist Granary Care Home, in Wraxall, North Somerset, was unlike the horror stories he had read about. The men, who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence came to light, pleaded guilty to the abuse, which took place in October and December 2012. Baynes, of Bath, was handed four months behind bars after admitting three counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity, and another of theft after he was caught stealing Mrs Wright's food. Salnikow, of Southmead, Bristol, who practised yoga while in the dock, was given two months in prison, suspended for two years after admitting three counts of ill-treatment. Gidaszewski, of Nailsea, north Somerset, was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work for admitting one count of the same. Despite the sentences however Mr Wright believes nothing will change until 24 hour CCTV is placed in all homes. Speaking afterwards he said: 'I wish I recorded nothing but good behaviour. That would have been the best outcome. 'I had no reason to believe there would be problems, because she wouldn't have gone there in the first place. 'I believe we'll be seeing many more instances of the abuse of vulnerable individuals and know this will not improve until we see the implementation of CCTV in these homes.'","Public will be told how to best undertake secret surveillance of carers .

"Doctors treating a woman for stomach pain were shocked to find a very unlikely cause for it - a potato inside her vagina. The 22-year-old woman, from Colombia, was advised by her mother to use the technique to avoid becoming pregnant. But by the time doctors discovered the potato, it had apparently germinated and grown roots inside her. Scroll down for video . The woman, from Colombia, was advised by her mother to use the potato to avoid becoming pregnant . The story was covered by Colombia Reports, a large news website in the country. It claims the unnamed woman told doctors: 'My mum told me that if I didn't want to get pregnant, I should put a potato up there, and I believed her.' The discovery was made when the woman, from the central Colombian town of Honda, went to hospital complaining of abdominal pains. When a nurse examined her, she found roots from the potato that had grown. However after removing it, doctors confirmed there would be no lasting damage to the woman's health. Medical staff at the hospital have criticised the woman's mother for the terrible contraceptive advice. The bizarre case sheds light on a lack of sex education, despite it being mandatory in the South American country. Research conducted by the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare - to try and reduce high levels of teenage pregnancy - found a startling lack of awareness about contraception in young people. Girls are often pressured into having unsafe sex, the campaign found. Maria Eugenia Rosselli, the Colombian Ministry of Education sociologist was reported said the lack of 'sex talk' between young people and their parents had created a void of information. This, in turn, had created high levels of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.

Major Yair, one of the country’s most experienced unmanned drones commanders, said he had made mistakes but had ‘learnt to live’ with them.

A staggering 65 per cent of Israel’s military air operations are conducted by drones rather than planes which are manned by military personnel. He said: ‘You have to make life and death calls in seconds. You spot it – what is it? Shall we take it out or not? You have to develop the mental skills.’ Major Yair told the Telegraph: ‘We do make mistakes. But it’s nature. People make mistakes. We learn from those mistakes. You’ll see no smiling face after an incident where kids are killed. ‘None of us want to be in a position where he does these mistakes.

"Nigel Farage has dismissed claims that Ukip backs the repatriation of EU migrants who have lived and worked in Britain for years. He insists the party would allow lawful migrants to stay – even if the UK leaves the European Union. His intervention follows a storm of protest after Ukip candidate Mark Reckless, who is set to win the party’s second parliamentary seat in the Rochester and Strood by-election tomorrow night, was accused of advocating the repatriation of existing migrants. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) has dismissed claims that Ukip backs the repatriation of EU migrants who have lived and worked in Britain for years and insists the party would allow lawful migrants to stay . Labour last night condemned his remarks as an echo of the policies of the British National Party and claimed he had ‘let the mask slip’. Mr Reckless, who defected from the Tories in September, told an audience of residents on Tuesday that European migrants could remain in Britain on work permits for a ‘fixed period’ – even if they own a home and have children at local schools. Asked if they could be deported, he did not deny it – but said cases would be looked at ‘sympathetically’ if someone had lived in Britain for years and was well integrated. However, he hastily backtracked today, insisting that he had meant a tougher immigration system advocated by Ukip would only apply to new migrants, not those already in Britain. And Mr Farage, whose wife is German, claimed Mr Reckless had made the comments in a ‘minor confusion’ and confirmed that Ukip’s policy was to allow all migrants who already live in Britain lawfully to remain here. The Ukip leader said: ‘We have never suggested since 2004 that anybody who has come here legally and in good faith should be subject to retrospective legislation...that would be unfair, un-British and wrong. ‘Let me make this clear, during our divorce negotiations, even if the European Union was to behave badly, and was to say, people living in Spain would be threatened with not being there, we would maintain the line that we believe in the rule of law, we believe in British justice, we believe anybody who has come to Britain legally has the right to remain.’ Ukip candidate Mark Reckless (pictured)  was accused of advocating the repatriation of existing migrants - he backtracked today and said he meant a tougher immigration system would only apply to new migrants . He said Mr Reckless had been fighting a two-month election campaign. ‘This is the first bit of confusion that has been caused,’ Mr Farage added. ‘Apart from confusion over that he has not put a foot wrong.’ Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, condemned Mr Reckless’s comments as ‘nasty’ and said Ukip had ‘let the mask slip’. She said: ‘To hear the language of repatriation coming from someone they hope will be their second MP is shameful. ‘It’s a policy that comes straight out of the last BNP manifesto and does not reflect British values.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham added: ‘This is an extreme agenda. Nearly every British family has got a connection with Europe and immigration… My wife’s Dutch. Is she going back under Mark Reckless’s plan?’ Mr Reckless denied he had been confused, saying he had meant that if Britain leaves the EU ‘anyone here lawfully under freedom of movement rules we would allow to stay’. He said repatriation was ‘not a word I’ve used’ and said some of the Conservative rhetoric about immigration during the campaign had been ‘disgraceful’. Conservative ministers did not condemn his remarks. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who was campaigning in the area yesterday, said the idea of deporting migrants was ‘wacky’. However, he said Mr Reckless had previously supported free movement of migrants and this showed he was ‘willing to say anything to get elected.’ Mr Pickles said he was ‘certain’ the Conservatives could win the by-election, although polls have suggested Mr Reckless has a 15 point lead. The Tory candidate, 36 year-old businesswoman Kelly Tolhurst, used a hustings in the town to appeal to Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green voters to back the Conservatives to keep Ukip out. Miss Tolhurst said: ‘It’s a two-horse race and the reality of it is if we don’t want to wake up to a Ukip MP on Friday 21st November then people who would normally be voting for Labour, the Lib Dems or anyone else, then they need to be voting for me.’ Two more Conservative MPs are said to have held secret discussions about defecting to Ukip. Mark Reckless, who defected from the Tories in September, said he had been contacted by two former colleagues during his campaign to win the Rochester and Strood seat today. Winning the poll would make ‘a number of Tory MPs consider their position’, he claimed. One Tory MP held a ‘cloak and dagger’ meeting with Mr Reckless to discuss the process of defection in detail, while another has contacted him by phone, he revealed yesterday. Mr Reckless said: ‘I have spoken with two Conservative MPs about the possibility of their moving over, and I think they will want to see what the result is tonight before making any decisions. It is a very individual decision. And I feed back to Nigel on those conversations. ‘A lot of Conservative MPs will be looking at the result closely. I think it’s about Ukip being able to show we are taking votes from Labour as well as the Conservatives.’ One of those rumoured to be on the verge of quitting the Tories is Peter Bone, the arch Eurosceptic MP for Wellingborough. He is speaking at the Cambridge Union tonight in favour of the motion that ‘Ukip has been good for British politics’. Yesterday Mr Bone said the date of the debate had been fixed months ago and said he wanted Ukip members to ‘come back and join the Conservatives’. It emerged yesterday that Mr Bone, as well as Tories Philip Hollobone and Martin Vickers are polling their constituents on membership of the EU. Mr Reckless did the same before defecting in September, as did Douglas Carswell before he changed parties in August. Tory Communities Minister Eric Pickles downplayed further defections, saying: ‘I don’t think there will be any. ‘We have brought the economy back from the brink.’","Nigel Farage has dismissed claims Ukip backs repatriation of EU migrants .

"Connelly appeared before a Parole Board panel at the end of July . THE family of Baby P reacted with fury yesterday as the mother  who allowed him to be tortured to death prepared for her release from prison. Tracey Connelly is expected to walk out of jail within 24 hours after being granted parole yesterday. The 32-year-old was jailed indefinitely and ordered to serve a minimum of five years in May 2009 for causing or allowing her son Peter’s death, but the Parole Board believes she is no longer a danger to the public. Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is set to walk free from prison after a decision by a three member Parole Board panel.  She was jailed indefinitely with a . minimum of five years in May 2009 for causing or allowing the death of . her son Peter - known by his case workers as Baby P (right) With time on remand following her arrest in 2007, Connelly has served longer than five years. The . decision to release her has appalled relatives of Baby P who died at . his mother’s flat in Tottenham, North London, in 2007. The 17-month-old . had more than 50 injuries, including a broken back. Yesterday . a relative of Baby P’s father said: ‘I have been dreading this day for . years and it’s finally come around. This is a real kick in the teeth. She should have served much longer. In my view she should never have . been let out. This is not justice.’ He . added that Peter’s father and siblings ‘are attempting to get on with . their lives as a family and I don’t know how this is going to affect . them’. Connelly had . admitted doing nothing while Peter was tortured to death by her . boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. The . case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, . police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have . saved the child’s life. She is understood to be currently detained at Low Newton jail near Durham (pictured) Owen . was freed on licence in 2011 but returned to jail in April this year . after breaching parole conditions. Barker was given an indefinite . sentence with a tariff of ten years. Still inside: Jason Owen, 37, was one of three people jailed over the death of Baby P. He is back in prison after breaching his parole conditions . Yesterday . officials were debating moving Connelly from Low Newton jail near . Durham to another prison prior to her release to protect her from attack . by vigilantes. She will . then be taken to a probation hostel away from London. Connelly has not . been given a new identity, but will be encouraged to change her name by . deed poll. She has been given tips on how to hide her true identity and change her appearance after she received death threats. She already looks different from her police mugshot after ballooning to 22st in prison. She will be seen every week by probation officials and prohibited from returning to Haringey, North London. After a stint in the probation hostel, Connelly will be allowed to move into a private home. But she will be banned from contacting her remaining three children by Baby P’s father and her youngest child by Barker. Social services will be alerted should she get pregnant again and would almost certainly apply to have the baby taken into care. She . will remain on licence for the rest of her life and will be recalled to . custody if she breaches the conditions of her licence. 2006 . March 1 - Peter Connelly is born to Tracey Connelly.

"Cairo University students reportedly tried to rip the clothes off a blonde woman as she walked across the campus, sparking outrage across Egypt. The unnamed woman, who was wearing a long-sleeved pink top and fitted black jeans, was recently filmed being abused by a large group of male students as she made her way through the university, one of the country's largest. The men, some of whom were reportedly law students, went wild, wolf-whistling and jeering as she hurried to get away from them. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught on camera: Male students were filmed jeering and wolf-whistling as a blonde woman walked across Cairo University campus - with a campaigner claiming they went on to try and undress her . Reaction: University dean Gaber Nassar said the student's outfit, which he described as 'a bit unconventional', led to the harassment - but he added that he wasn't justifying the incident . Intimidating: The blonde woman was surrounded by men . Fathi Farid, a member of the ‘I saw harassment’ anti-sexual harassment group, said male students had verbally attacked the woman and attempted to undress her, according to AFP. University dean Gaber Nassar said the student's outfit, which he described as ‘a bit unconventional,’ led to the harassment, quickly adding that he was not justifying the incident. ‘This girl entered the university wearing an abaya (loose cloak) and then took it off in the faculty, and appeared with those clothes, that caused, in reality… the incident,’ Nassar said on private Egyptian channel ONTV. He said university guards turn away students who show up at campus dressed inappropriately. ‘The student's mistake does not justify what the (other) students did,’ he added. Most of Cairo University's female students wear jeans and tops and avoid revealing clothes, and many wear the traditional Islamic headscarves, as do the majority of Egypt's women. Nassar later wrote on Twitter that he was misunderstood and that he was not blaming the student for the incident. ‘I assure that this is not true and I apologise for the misunderstanding and I repeat that those who (harassed the girl) will be severely punished,’ he wrote. Mr Farid added: ‘The worst is that people always find justification for the harassment and blame it on the victim.’ Justice: The dean has vowed to punish those responsible for the abuse . Anger: The incident at Cairo University (pictured), provoked outrage . Nassar ‘should be interrogated and expelled, investigations into the incident should start immediately’, women's rights activist Mariam Kirollos wrote on her Twitter account. Several popular talk-shows covered the incident. ‘A girl is naked, does it mean someone should jump on her?’ television host Amr Adib asked in disbelief, during his show on the privately-owned Orbit channel. More than 99 per cent of women in Egypt have been subjected to a form of harassment, according to a study carried out in 2013 by UN Women. Women report that they are harassed regardless of whether they are dressed in conservative Islamic veils or Western-style clothing. In 2013 there were reports of premeditated and state-backed sex attacks on female protesters in Egypt’s Tahrir Square. Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment/Assault (OpAntiSh), set up to rescue victims from the Square received 19 reports of group sexual assaults, six of which resulted in hospitalisation, while the worst case involved the mutilation of a woman's genitalia with a knife.","The unnamed woman was jeered at as she walked across the campus .

"Exclusive access to a swimming pool and no queues for flumes seems like a treat restricted to the rich and famous. But two friends made it a reality when they hid in the changing rooms of Cascades Leisure Centre in Kent so they could swim and ride on as many flumes as they wanted after dark. The pair had the run of the Kent leisure centre during the evening, using the flumes, a children's slide, clambering over an ornamental crocodile and even skinny dipping. Dan Jarvis, 26, and Raith O'Shea, 27, filmed themselves riding the flumes and swimming after the lights had gone out. Scroll down for video . Dan Jarvis, 26, and Raith O'Shea hid in the changing rooms of Cascades Leisure Centre in Kent so they could use the flumes, play on ornaments and even go skinny dipping after the centre had closed to the public . But the prank has seen them criticised by security bosses who warned it could have been dangerous and said safety measures had now been reviewed. Mr Jarvis, a media student at London South Bank University said: 'I had planned it for about a month or two and then one day I just said to Raith we should do it on that night because we were bored. 'We hid in the changing rooms for about 40 minutes before we came out. 'The cleaner was cleaning the changing rooms so we quickly went in one they had already cleaned and just sat there. The pair filmed themselves getting exclusive use of the flumes and jumping into the swimming pool naked . Raith O'Shea (left) and Dan Jarvis filmed their escapade in the leisure centre before posting the video online . 'We had to hide our clothes because we couldn't use the lockers and just waited for the lights to go off and the security to leave.' He said after the cleaners left at about 9pm the pair went into the pool, staying there about two hours. 'It was quite hot in there because the air con had been turned off so when we were jumping in the pool it was nice and cool,' he added. 'We had such a laugh in there and stayed till about 11pm, the flumes were switched off but because of the water it was still slippery so we could still use them a bit. 'I haven't had a call from the centre or the police yet, and I don't think I would do it again at that pool because the security will be really tight now. 'I might consider doing it at another pool further away though, you never know.' Dan Jarvis posted the video on his Facebook page and said it has already been shared multiple times . The pair used flumes after they had been turned off, saying remaining moisture meant they were still slippery . The friends have been criticised by security bosses who said they could have created a dangerous situation . Mr Jarvis posted an edited video on Facebook, called Cascades Leisure Centre after hours night edition.' The one minute and 26 second clip features pictures of the pair hanging off rides and ends with the caption 'I'm never growing up.' At the end the pair bid their viewers farewell and said the escapade had been 'emotional.' The video has already been shared by dozens of his friends. Gravesham Community Leisure Ltd (GCLL) in Gravesend, Kent, has condemned the stunt. Rob Swain said: 'There was a breach of GCLL's security measures on Sunday evening with two persons hiding themselves on purpose within the building at Cascades Leisure Centre. Dan Jarvis decided to stay in the leisure centre after dark because he was bored and had been planning it . Raith O'Shea is pictured riding one of the flumes at the leisure centre after he hid until cleaners left at 9pm . The friends filmed themselves climbing over an ornamental crocodile as well as on the centre's flumes . 'This resulted in them being in the building at a time when it was locked. 'GCLL's security alarm system was operated with staff attending the site but the two persons had vacated the building prior to the arrival of staff. 'GCLL are in liaison with Kent Police on this matter with the most appropriate action being taken in due course. 'It should be said that this could be an extremely dangerous situation with unsupervised persons in such a facility as a leisure centre.' Just hours before the prank, Dan wrote on Facebook that he planned to go to the pool next weekend and asked people if they wanted to join him.","Dan Jarvis and Raith O'Shea hid in changing rooms of Kent leisure centre .

"This is the moment a raging passenger launched a foul-mouthed tirade at a bus driver because he refused to leave a stop early. The woman, dressed in a black jacket, was filmed by a fellow passenger on the lower deck of the National Express West Midlands bus in Perry Barr, Birmingham. A shocking video shows how when the driver delayed leaving the stop the woman shouted at him before unleashing the torrent of angry words. Foul-mouthed: The woman, dressed in a black jacket, was filmed by a fellow passenger on the lower deck of the National Express West Midlands bus in Perry Barr, Birmingham . She screamed: ‘Don’t argue with me. I’m not scared of you f*****. Don’t speak to me. You’re supposed to be a man and I don’t expect you to be scared. ‘You argumentative b******, you’re meant to be a bus driver. You’re meant to be a bus driver. Drive the f***** bus before you crash it, b******. You’re not meant to be arguing with the customers.’ The driver tries to calm the woman, by saying: ‘Yeah, yeah, you’re right,’ but this enrages the woman and she escalates her rant, threatening to get him sacked. She fumes: ‘If your boss found out you’d get the f****** sack. I know you f****** would. Shut your mouth, I can shout as much as I want. Yeah.’ On camera: The driver tries to calm the woman, by saying: ‘Yeah, yeah, you’re right,’ but this enrages the woman and she escalates her rant, threatening to get him sacked . The man filming then gets up and leaves the bus, pausing to sympathise with the beleaguered driver. He says: ‘Just don’t say nothing bruv [sic], just leave it bruv.’ Public transport: A file picture of a National Express West Midlands bus, on which the incident happened . The driver then shows the man his timetable and says: ‘I’ve got to go by the times on there.'  He then adds: ‘What’s wrong with her? She had a bad day or something?’ After the video was posted to YouTube shocked commenters blasted the unnamed woman. Fliss Powell wrote: ‘I find it disgusting that anyone, let alone a woman, can act like this. ‘We all get frustrated at things in this day and age - but she was acting appallingly. I think the bus driver however should of said his piece then ignored her... stupid woman.’ Andrew Eves added: ‘In the good old days the passenger would have been escorted off the bus. ‘How do I know? My father was a bus driver for over 40 years with BCT [Birmingham City Transport]. No-one has to put up with such utter c*** - neither the driver nor other passengers.’ A National Express West Midlands spokesman said: ‘The customer in question was upset because the bus had stopped at a timing point as the service was running early and spoke to the driver in a clearly unacceptable way. ‘We give our drivers conflict resolution training so they are well equipped to deal with these situations. Our driver handled himself well in this situation and showed a great deal of professionalism.’","Woman filmed by fellow passenger on bus lower deck in Birmingham .

"A Satanist neo-Nazi has cut his friend's neck open, splashed blood over himself then called police and sat cross-legged looking at a photograph of Hitler until they arrived. Robert Hej, 37, was arrested after calling police in the northern Serbian town of Becej and telling them 'Come over, I've massacred him'. When police arrived they found the blood-soaked corpse of Tibor Lucic, 50, lying on the floor, and Hej sitting cross-legged beside him surrounded by candles and looking at a photograph of Hitler. Robert Hej (pictured) is facing life in prison for the attack which police say was a type of 'sacrifice' Hej, a fervent neo-Nazi, takes a selfie with a photograph of Adolf Hitler stuck on a wall . A former friend of Hej, Niksa Brkic, 40, said: 'He was completely obsessed with Hitler, the Holocaust and the Devil. 'He sort of worshipped them all in equal measure. 'He used to take photographs of himself posing alongside a photo of Hitler and he belonged to a satanic cult. 'To be frank, he was a very disturbing and scary man. He often talked about carrying out a ritual slaughter, but I never believed he actually meant it. 'I broke off my friendship with him after he started talking crazy like this even more often. I didn't want to know or associate with him.' Hej, pictured wearing army camouflage and a leather waistcoat, was with a group earlier in the evening before they left just himself and the victim alone, police said . A police spokesman said: 'There were three other people at his apartment on the night of the murder, but they left leaving just him and the victim. 'From what we understand, they were all involved in some form of ritual in which Hej later decided Lucic would be sacrificed after it did not initially seem to go as planned.

"Don't tempt me... Britons are being told by the . health watchdog NICE not to offer treats to friends and family who . are trying to lose weight. (Stock picture) Britons are being told by the health watchdog not to offer sweet treats to friends and family who are trying to lose weight. They are also being instructed not to invite colleagues who are attempting to cut back on alcohol to go the pub after work. The watchdog, NICE, says it is neither ‘helpful’ nor ‘a joke’ to deliberately try to tempt those who are desperately trying to stick to resolutions to become healthier. Guidelines issued by the organisation today also urge doctors, nurses and midwives to question patients about their lifestyles when they arrive in A&E, have a routine appointment or scan, or come in to pick up a prescription. Staff should use ‘every opportunity’ to help patients change unhealthy habits. They are told not to be too ‘embarrassed’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet, or would consider doing do so. And if they suspect someone has a drink problem, they are encouraged to ask them questions designed to assess their alcohol intake. The guidelines – published when millions have made New Year’s resolutions to tackle their weight or drinking – are intended to help health staff and the general public tackle the rising problem of obesity and excessive drinking. Employers are told to consider banning staff from smoking throughout the working day and to ensure they motivate staff who are trying to lead healthier lives. The advice also reminds local councils they have the power to ban pubs from opening in areas where there are already a high number of licensed premises. But critics have accused NICE of ‘nannying’ and say the last thing adults need is to be ‘lectured’ on healthy living by their own friends and family. Robert Oxley, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘This is subversive nannying from a health quango that puts out this kind of drivel in a desperate attempt to justify its continued and costly existence. ‘Many of us will be trying to shed a few extra pounds or cut back on the booze over the new year, but we don’t need quangocrats lecturing our friends and colleagues while we do so. This is further evidence that NICE is both a waste of everybody’s time and taxpayers’ money.’ With more than a quarter of Britons now obese, the guidelines urge medics not to be too ‘embarrassed’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet, or would consider doing do so . But Professor Mike Kelly, director of the centre of public health at NICE, said: ‘The idea is quite simple. First of all you should share your goals with friends, family and work colleagues so they understand what you’re trying to do. ‘They also must understand it’s not helpful or a joke to tempt people deliberately. Some do – it’s a bit of fun. They go on a diet, and someone says, “Oh come on this cream cake won’t do any harm”.’ ‘Say for example someone says, “I’m going to make a real effort to cut down on my drinking.” If the first thing that happens within the next five minutes is that a colleague says, “Come on, we’re all going down the pub after work”, that doesn’t help. ‘It’s asking people to be a bit more thoughtful, a bit more understanding of the difficulties. When people fall off their best intentions, they can’t keep on the diet, that’s where friends, family and so on can help. ‘It’s a bit of encouragement and it’s a way of sharing the task rather than people trying to do it on their own. It’s based on very sound psychological principles which acknowledge that our ambitions often outstrip our human capacity to do things. ‘It’s that nudge in the right direction that can keep people on track.’ Just over a quarter of adults in Britain are now obese while nearly half of men and a third of women drink too much alcohol. NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, says Britons have done very well in recent years to cut down on smoking, but obesity and excessive drinking remain huge public health concerns. The watchdog is also in charge of deciding which new drugs should be available on the NHS and it has been criticised in the past for rejecting life-extending cancer drugs. Last year not one of the 11 new drugs made available was approved. Some of its other health guidance has been deemed controversial. Last year it suggested councils should raise parking charges to encourage the public to walk.","NICE tells Britons it's not 'a joke' to deliberately tempt those trying to slim .

"For most women, being eight and a half months pregnant means taking it easy, sitting back and hoping that Junior will put in an appearance before too long. Not Lea-Anne Ellison. The 35-year-old bodybuilder from Los Angeles has sparked an online storm after posting photos of herself lifting heavy weights on Facebook - with her due date just two weeks away. Elllison's photo has already had more than 16,000 comments posted beneath it since it first appeared on 15 September - and the feedback has been very mixed. Scroll down for video . Dangerous? Lea-Ann Ellison, 35, caused much debate when she posted photos of herself lifting weights . Regime: Lea-Ann describes herself as a huge fan of athletics and has been training throughout her pregnancy . While some appeared to support her decision, including several who claimed to be doctors, others were horrified. 'This is actually sickening,' wrote Amanda Cinq-Mars. 'I hope pregnant [women] around the world do not do this kind of cr**. 'I am a crossfit enthusiast but I DO NOT recommend this at all. Doctors always strongly suggest to not lift heavy because you can sever your placenta and cause major damage an early labour and miscarriage .... 'Posting this picture goes people the wrong message that this is OKAY when it's not!!!!' Another, Josh Giannapolous, wrote: 'Cross fit? This goes . way beyond a way of life, and right into an obsession. 'She is very . selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and . achievements. This is not a proud picture to post. Controversial: Lea-Ann's decision to continue weightlifting caused outrage among some commenters . Unrepentant: Lea-Ann took to Facebook to answer her critics and thank supporters for their 'love' 'That amount of weight . lifted above the head is extremely dangerous while pregnant. Cross fit . is a hobby, not a necessity to life. It's becoming unconscious to the . dangers of reality.' Others sprang to her defence, with Katy McNiff Nicholas writing: 'You go girl! Looking great!!! Much better than a lot of obese pregnant ladies with high blood pressure and diabetes who get short of breath walking up a flight of steps.' Ellison also took to Facebook herself, commenting: 'I want to thank everyone for their kind . and supportive responses! 'Haters will hate and it's ok. My life is not . their life thank goodness! Lol! Again, thank you! It means so much to . feel this much love from a community I adore.' Her comments echo previous remarks made on her profile page on the website Bodybuilders.com. On it, Ellison, who also has a son aged eight and a daughter aged 12, says: 'I have always loved athletics and . fitness. Hot mama: Lea-Ann has declared her intention to be a 'hot mom' and plans to continue with her workouts . Janet Fyle from the Royal College of Midwives said: 'She's quite far along in her pregnancy so there can't really be any problem with it, and if she's always done weightlifting I don't think it would suddenly bring on early labour. 'Obviously we aren't advising pregnant women to take up weightlifting if they've never done it before, but if she's used to the exercise it's OK. 'We always say if women were riding bikes or going to the gym before they were pregnant they can continue to do so, they just need to tell their instructor they are pregnant and then they can adjust the exercises. 'I understand why people might be concerned, but if the woman doesn't want to stop doing her exercise that's fine.' 'After the birth of my second child, I knew I needed to step it . up big time! I loved being a Mom but I wanted to be a HOT Mom. 'This is just the beginning for me and I assure you there are big . things to come for this Hot Mom.' Ellison isn't the only workout loving mother-to-be to make headlines after her pregnancy regime came to light. Four years ago Cambridgeshire fitness enthusiast Sarah-Jane Cousins hit the front pages after being pictured lifting 15kg dumbbells with just 11 days to go before her due date. Another mother criticised for continuing a tough fitness regime throughout her pregnancy was model Nell McAndrew who was stunned at the backlash she received after competing in a gruelling marathon while 20 weeks pregnant. Speaking to MailOnline after the marathon in November last year, McAndrew said: 'When I tell people I'm still exercising, they react as if I've told them I've been smoking or drinking alcohol while pregnant. 'But what I'm doing is actually good for me and my baby.' Nell's belief that fitness aids labour is backed up by studies that have found that babiesof women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because 'foetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers,' according to The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). Along with official NHS guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day for expectant mothers, the RCOG also advocate exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy and precautions are taken such as not exercising at a high intensity to raise the heart rate to its maximum and not running while it's too hot due to a risk of overheating. They state: 'In most cases, exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue exercise to derive the health benefitsassociated with such activities.' Mixed response: Lea-Ann posted her photographs on the Crossfit Facebook page and was met with both support and anger . They add that it's a fallacy that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or damage to an unborn baby stating 'women should be advised that adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes are not increased for exercising women.' They explain that exercising while pregnant has numerous benefits for the mother's health and wellbeing: 'Maternal benefits appear to be both physical and psychological in nature. Many common complaints of pregnancy, including fatigue, varicosities and swelling of extremities, are reduced in women who exercise. 'Additionally, active women experience less insomnia, stress, anxiety and depression.' Women who exercise while pregnant will also gain less excess weight, lowering the health risks associated with obesity.","Lea-Ann Ellison, 35, caused outrage after posting the photo on Facebook .

"Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has used an address to the United Nations Security Council to paint a terrifying picture of the young, modern day terrorist. Bishop, who chaired the Security Council meeting on counter-terrorism, said there was no more pressing matter of national and international security for Australia than reducing the threat of terrorism. 'The threat from ISIL, or Daesh, al-Nusra Front and other al-Qaeda affiliated groups is more dangerous, more global and more diversified than ever before,' Bishop told the meeting in New York on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop speaks in New York during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on terrorism . 'Terrorists are younger, more violent, more innovative and highly interconnected. 'They are masters of social media to terrorise, and to recruit, and are very tech-savvy. 'They incite each other. 'They communicate their propaganda and violence directly into our homes to recruit disaffected young men and women.' Bishop used the example of Melbourne 17-year-old Adam Dahman 'who grew up in a typical Australian household and played sport for his local high school' and the three Succarieh brothers from Brisbane. Bishop chaired the Security Council meeting on counter-terrorism. She said there was no more pressing matter of national and international security for Australia than reducing terrorism . 'Recently he (Dahman) travelled to Iraq and detonated his explosives vest in a suicide bomb attack in a Baghdad market place injuring more than 90 people,' Bishop said. 'Young people, like the three brothers from Brisbane. 'One became Australia's first known suicide bomber killing himself and 35 others at a military checkpoint in Syria. 'The second is currently fighting with al-Nusra. 'The third was stopped by Australian authorities before he got on a plane to join them.' Ms Bishop is targeting the likes of Australian Islamic terrorist Mohamed Elomar from Sydney . Representatives from the 15 Security Council members, including the US, Russia, China, Britain and France, along with other nations such as Saudi Arabia, Syria and Pakistan, took turns in addressing the meeting. Raimonda Murmokaite, chair of the UN's Counter-Terrorism Committee, told the meeting some states had failed to 'adequately criminalise' travel by terrorists who transit through their territories on the way to other countries. Gaps exist in the international exchange of information between law enforcement and intelligence agencies to bring terrorists to justice and some states do not use Interpol databases at border crossings, Murmokaite said. Sydney's  Khaled Sharrouf is another dangerous Islamic terrorist that Ms Bishop wants to stop . Australia's ambassador to the UN, Gary Quinlan, also the chair of the UN's al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, told the meeting Islamic State's seizure of oil fields in Syria and Iraq, and the group's ability to use smuggling routes to sell oil, was earning the terror group revenue ranging from $US846,000 to $US1.645 million ($A1.78 million) a day. Quinlan's committee also recommended measures to tackle terror groups' ability in Syria and Iraq to raise money from selling looted antiquities. 'A comprehensive approach is needed that properly integrates UN strategies with multilateral and national action,"" Quinlan said. Australia this month took up the rotating position of president of the Security Council. Ms Bishop told the UN meeting that the threat from ISIL, or Daesh, al-Nusra Front and other al-Qaeda affiliated groups is 'more dangerous, more global and more diversified than ever before' At the beginning of the meeting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised Australia's leadership. 'Let me begin by recognising the global leadership of Australia which this month successfully chaired the G20 summit in Brisbane where I had the honour of participating and is also presiding over the Security Council this month,' Moon said .","Terrorists are younger, more violent and innovative, says Foreign Minister .

"Warning: Paul Kenny General Secretary of the GMB pledged a huge campaign of civil disobedience . Union leaders yesterday threatened the ‘biggest  campaign’ of civil disobedience in Britain’s history if  the Coalition tries to curb workers’ rights. They plan to disrupt public events, block motorways and are prepared to ‘go to prison’ in protest at proposed changes to their pensions. On the opening day of the Trades Union Congress in London, anger over Government plans to ask union members to pay more towards public sector retirement deals sparked a series of increasingly militant threats. Left-wing firebrand Bob  Crow, general secretary of the RMT, has argued that mass strikes and civil unrest were now ‘inevitable’. ‘If workers come under attack then it runs in the veins of the trade union movements history to mobilise civil disobedience and resistance,’ he said. ‘From blocking motorways to disrupting Bono at Glastonbury, those are the kind of tactics we need to add to our campaigns.’ Paul Kenny, of the GMB union added: ‘Bad laws have to be broken. Civil disobedience in protest at erosion of civil liberties and freedoms have a place in  our history. ‘If going to prison is the price to pay for standing up to bad laws, then so be it. We will give politicians the biggest campaign of civil disobedience their tiny minds have ever seen.’ TUC Secretary Brendan Barber: The riots which swept through English cities last month revealed 'deep fractures' in Britain's society, he said . TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber yesterday announced a new £2million fund to combat Government spending cuts, raised by charging a 10p levy on its six million members. Speaking at the TUC congress, Mr Barber launched a wide-ranging attack on the Government’s spending cuts and ‘outrageous’ plans to reform public service pensions. He condemned the Government’s reaction to last month’s riots and described the Coalition’s deficit-cutting agenda as ‘cruel and mistaken’. Mr Barber added that there was a ‘strong risk’ of further strike action unless there was a breakthrough in talks over proposed increases to public sector workers’ pension contributions. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said unions should not 'meekly accept' employment laws . The strong-worded comments  from the union leaders will increase pressure on Labour leader Ed Miliband to condemn the strike threats when he addresses the TUC today. Mr Miliband will defend Labour’s historic link with the unions, but he will call on the them to focus on ‘getting on, not getting even’. He will say: ‘The challenge for unions is this: to recognise that Britain needs to raise its game if we are to meet the challenges of the future and to get private sector employers in the new economy to recognize that you are relevant to that future.’ Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘Union leaders now seem to be encouraging mass law breaking as part of their campaign of “civil disobedience”. Ed Miliband must condemn any incitement to criminality from his union backers.’ 'Fractured Britain': A resident films a police officer on his mobile phone during disturbances in Hackney, London .","Leader's call to arms to fight plans for 'anti-union' legislation .

"Today's babies could live eight years longer if they are born in the Home Counties than in the North West, new data shows today. Life expectancy varies wildly between different parts of the country and between the sexes, the Office for National Statistics found. The age gap is so stark that healthy adults move from poorer areas in the north to better health areas in the south, leaving those behind with lower life expectancy. Scroll down for video . The data shows life expectancy varies between areas. Girls born in Chiltern can expect to live longest (86.4 years), more than six years longer than Manchester, where life expectancy was lowest (80). Boys born in South Cambridgeshire have the highest longevity at 83.0 years - 8.7 years longer than in the area with the lowest, Blackpool (74.3 years). Life expectancy varied across English regions and tended to be higher among those in the South than in the North and Midlands, the ONS said. In 2011/13, life expectancy at birth was highest in the South East (80.4 years) for males and in London for females (84.1 years). Conversely, they were lowest in the North West for males (78 years) and in the North East for females (81.7 years). Maps released by the Office for National Statistics show how life expectancy is highest in the south and lowest in the north . The ONS report said: 'Studies have shown that the selective migration of healthy individuals from poorer health areas into better health areas as well as socio-economic, environmental (including working conditions), educational and lifestyle factors are largely responsible for the excess mortality and consequently lower life expectancy in northern regions compared with those in the south. 'Nevertheless, life expectancy continues to increase at a faster pace in the northern regions and in London than the other southern regions. One possible explanation is the varying rate of decrease in deaths from avoidable causes across English regions. 'Since 2001, the greatest reduction in deaths rates for potentially avoidable causes such as certain cancers, respiratory and heart disease have been seen in the North East, North West and London.' However, statisticians said the gap between regions is narrowing. Life expectancy at birth and at age 65 increased at a faster pace in London, the North East and the North West compared with other regions between 2007-09 and 2011-13. Life expectancy at birth and at age 65 increased at a faster pace in London, the North East and the North West compared with other regions between 2007–09 and 2011–13 . For males, the greatest increases were seen in London, the North West and North East while the least were in the South West and South East. Boys born today can expect to live for just under 80 years - nearly four years less than a girl, official figures show. Life expectancy at birth for males in England and Wales increased from 78.1 years in 2007 to 2009 to 79.3 years in 2011 to 2013, the ONS said. The female figure increased from 82.2 to 83 years over the same period. But the gap between the sexes continues to narrow, falling from 4.1 years in 2007-09 to 3.7 years in 2011-13. For females, a similar picture was observed with the greatest increases in life expectancy recorded in London, the East Midlands and the North West and the lowest in the South East and South West. Women from the Chilterns can expect to live 12 years longer than men from Blackpool, according to today's figures exposing the north-south divide in life expectancy . Simon Bottery, director of policy at the charity Independent Age, said: 'While, we are in the main, living longer lives, these new figures show the health inequality gap is widening. 'There are clear variations between different areas of the country, with higher life expectancy in the South and lower life expectancy in North. 'While there are a range of reasons for such regional variations, this continued increase in health inequalities must be addressed. Sufficient services and resources should be made available to support older people's health and social care needs in local areas most at risk.'","Office for National Statistics reveals stark differences in life expectancy between the north and south .

"Marcin Wojtak who was killed in Afghanistan in an armoured vehicle . A British serviceman killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan told his parents the armoured vehicle he later died in was a ‘coffin on wheels’. Acting Corporal Marcin Wojtak, 24, lost his life when the Vector light troop carrier he commanded was blown up by a 40lb improvised explosive device (IED). He had sent emails to his family from the frontline complaining his unit was being ‘put at risk’ by having to patrol in vehicles with insufficient underfloor protection. The gunner had been due to pick up a sturdier armoured Mastiff vehicle the day after his death in October 2009. Cpl Wojtak’s unit was patrolling in the desert south of Camp Bastion, the main British base in southern Afghanistan, when a blast ripped through his Vector. His mother accused the Government of the ‘catastrophic failure’ of its servicemen at the end of an inquest into his death this week. Before deploying to Helmand, Cpl Wojtak, who served with 34 Squadron RAF Regiment, had assured his family he would be driving a Mastiff which could withstand small explosions. Instead, he was given a Vector to help carry out his regiment’s role, which was to provide security outside the perimeter of Camp Bastion and ensure aircraft coming in to land were safe from insurgents. Cpl Wojtak’s father told the three-day inquest at Loughborough Coroner’s Court that his son used to describe the Vectors as ‘coffins on wheels’, and had emailed from the base to express anger at having to use them for patrols. ‘It was even to the point of gross disgruntlement that they were being exposed in this way,’ Mr Wojtak said. ‘The general feeling was they were being put at risk.’ 'Coffin on wheels': A Vector armoured vehicle similar to the one being driven by Corporal Wojtak when the bomb exploded in Helmand Province . A fleet of Mastiff vehicles on display at Camp Bastion in 2007. The stronger vehicles replaced the Vectors, which were only capable of withstanding a 10 kilo blast . After the inquest, Cpl Wojtak’s . mother Teresa Woods, 53, a teacher, said: ‘It’s not surprising that . someone met their death in a Vector. This vehicle was no longer suitable . to deal with the increased threats of Afghanistan, and that was . acknowledged as well. ‘I feel there has been a catastrophic failure by the Government to meet the requirements for our troops.’ She attacked the decision to send the . troops on patrol before they collected the 28-ton Mastiff. ‘I am . bitterly disappointed that they could not wait another day,’ she said. The Government had announced in May . 2009 it was phasing out the Vector trucks from frontline patrols – five . months before Cpl Wojtak’s death. But they were still in use in October . when he died, during his fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan. Remote: British soldiers return from a mission to camp Bastion, the base there Corporal Wojtak was stationed, in the southern province of Helmand, Afghanistan (file picture) Giving evidence to the inquest, . Corporal David Hayden, who was part of the patrol, said troops elsewhere . in Helmand received Mastiffs as a priority because they were being hit . by IEDs four or five times a day. The RAF Regiment had been struck twice . in two months. Wing Commander Shaun Ryles, Cpl . Wojtak’s commanding officer, said the patrol ‘could not be delayed’ for . the Mastiffs because his men had a vital role protecting the airfield. He said: ‘There was potential leading . up to an attack on an aircraft. By delaying that patrol, even by a day, . the insurgent is winning and I cannot allow that to happen. You have to . take risks.’ Coroner Andrew Chapman ruled that Cpl Wojtak, from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, was unlawfully killed by the Taliban. ‘It is clear the Vector had very real shortcomings,’ he said.",Mother of Marcin Wojtak accuses MoD of a 'catastrophic failure'
"A Texas man is suing four doctors and a hospital for $10 million over a botched bariatric sleeve procedure after he woke up in hospital two weeks later missing both of his legs. Carlos Saucedo, 32, went in for the weight-loss procedure at Baylor Medical Center at Trophy Club, near Fort Worth, one year ago. He weighed 275 pounds and wanted to turn his life around. However, Saucedo says the doctors were 'directly negligent' when performing the surgery and mistakenly pierced his aorta towards the start of the operation, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. 'Lifetime of medical care"": Carlos Saucedo has filed a lawsuit claiming negligence by doctors involved in his 2013 gastric sleeve procedure near Fort Worth, which resulted in both his legs being amputated . The error occurred as the surgeons were guiding a camera into Saucedo's abdomen that would allow them to remove more than half of his stomach. Saucedo soon lost four liters of blood and, as his blood pressure began dropping, doctors saw the punctured artery and stitched it up to stop the bleeding. They did not realize it was his aorta, the largest artery in the body. The decision cut off blood circulation to both of Saucedo's legs, leaving them 'cold and pulseless'. Doctors aborted the surgery and Saucedo was transferred to the intensive care unit at Baylor Medical Center in Grapevine. By that time his organs were beginning to fail because the blood flow had been cut, and he underwent bilateral amputations below and then above the knee. Saucedo woke up in hospital two weeks later believing he was recovering from gastric band surgery, but that procedure was never performed. 'Everything just kind of just crashed down in my mind,' Saucedo told WFAA. 'I was kind of in shock.' Scene: The operation took place at the Baylor Regional Medical Center in Grapevine in November 2013 . Saucedo said he believed Dr. David Kim of Kim Bariatric Institute was doing the procedure. Kim had just done the same operation on Saucedo's wife. However on the day he learned that Dr Bridget Holden was operating on him. The lawsuit says another physician, Dr Franchell Richard-Hamilton, was also in the room and that Saucedo did not give her permission to be there. Dr Richard-Hamilton is the one who sewed the aorta shut, the lawsuit contends. Dr Kim, Dr Holden and Dr Richard-Hamilton are all named in the lawsuit, as well as Dr. Alexander Hatcher, who saw Saucedo in the emergency room at Baylor Grapevine. None of the defendants have commented on the lawsuit. Defendant: Dr. David Kim of Kim Bariatric Institute in Colleyville, along with three other doctors, have been named in the lawsuit . Saucedo is being fitted for prothesis and 'will require lifetime medical care', the lawsuit says. His marriage ended following the surgery and he has had to move to Laredo so his parents can care for him. He is also suffering 'phantom' pain from where his legs used to be and has psychological issues, according to the lawsuit. Last year doctors performed an estimated 179,000 bariatric procedures in the United States.","Carlos Saucedo, 32, has filed a lawsuit claiming negligence by doctors involved in his 2013 gastric sleeve procedure near Fort Worth .

"Like most women, Sandra Hastings experiences uncomfortable tummy pain once a month. She gets irritable and is quick to anger, leaving her family in no  doubt it’s time to be careful around Mum again. Yet Sandra, 39, doesn’t have PMT: instead she suffers an acute pain during ovulation. The mysterious and agonising condition, called Mittelschmerz by doctors, affects around one in five women and can leave sufferers incapacitated. The severe symptoms also have a profound effect on their relationships and working lives, with some women reporting personality changes alongside the pain. Acute pain: Sandra Hastings, 39, suffers extreme pain during ovulation because of a mysterious and agonising condition, called Mittelschmerz . Despite being relatively common, ovulation pain is little known. And, intriguingly for a medical phenomenon that blights the lives of women all over the world, the cause has not been found. Sandra, who lives in Newcastle with her partner James, 44, and children Hannah, 11, and Matthew, ten, says: ‘My family bear the brunt. That’s because it’s so painful, I have a much lower tolerance level, particularly towards my children. ‘I also find myself snapping at James for whatever reason and, bizarrely, I have to clean the house much more. I don’t know if that’s because I’m less tolerant, but during a bout I’m always picking things up and putting them away. ‘I know I’m being irrational but I just can’t help it. It’s the same every month.’ Ovulation pain usually lasts for up to  48 hours and, although it’s not clear why some women have it and others don’t, experts believe it may be down to genetics. One theory is that during ovulation, the ovarian wall ruptures, causing bruising. Unknown cause: One theory is that during ovulation, the ovarian wall ruptures, causing bruising . Bini Ajay, consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at St Anthony’s Hospital, Surrey, says: ‘The name Mittelschmerz is derived from the German word  for “middle pain” which means pain occurring in the middle of  the month. ‘It differs from period pain in that it usually occurs on the 14th day of the cycle, rather than during the days of bleeding. Around 20   per cent of women — or one in five — can have ovulation pain, which can occur regularly every month or intermittently. ‘Some experts believe the condition may be due to irritation of the abdominal lining at the time of ovulation, by blood or other fluid that is released from the ruptured egg follicle. ‘Another theory is that after ovulation, the ovaries or fallopian tubes contract, which may cause the pain.’ Many women suffer for years without a diagnosis, and the condition is often mistaken for appendicitis — as Sandra discovered when she first experienced ovulation pain at the age of ten and was rushed to hospital. ‘Two weeks earlier I’d had my first period, and I woke up in the night with a sharp stabbing sensation in my side,’ she says. ‘Mum took me straight to hospital, where I had a raft of tests and the doctors prepped me for surgery to remove my appendix. But within the hour the pain had gone so the surgery was cancelled. ‘They had no idea what had happened. I had blood tests and internal exams. There were all kinds of diagnoses, from stomach ulcers to bowel spasms. But it wasn’t until months later, when I’d been hospitalised several times, that my mother was told it could be ovulation pain.’ In common with other sufferers, Sandra agrees the pain is far worse than normal menstrual cramps. ‘It’s as if someone has taken the tip of a hot knife and poked it into my side,’ she says. ‘The longest it’s ever lasted is about an hour. Incapacitated: 'It's as if someone has taken the tip of a hot knife and poked it into my side' ‘It’s usually on my right-hand side — which is probably why it was mistaken for appendicitis — but it can be on both sides. ‘The intensity is breathtaking. Often I’ll have to stop what I’m doing and bend over, holding on to a chair or table, and I’ll press my fingers into the pain to ease it. Sandra, who works with people who have dementia, says: ‘Doctors told me it was something I would have to get used to. ‘They prescribe strong painkillers such as naproxen and codeine but I rarely take them because the pain only lasts for about an hour, so it’s gone by the time they kick in.’ When she was younger, Sandra used the Pill to quell the ache. It works, says Bini Ajay, because it prevents the ovary from releasing an egg, effectively stopping ovulation. ‘If you are trying to conceive and come off the contraceptive pill, the pain is likely to return,’ she says. ‘Ovulation pain doesn’t affect fertility — in fact it can be useful if you are trying for a baby because it tells you when you are ovulating.’ Years of suffering: Sandra (pictured as a child on holiday) has suffered from ovulation pain since the age of ten . However, the crippling pain can put women off making love at the time when their chance of conceiving is highest. When Sandra was in her early 20s she stopped taking the Pill to try for a baby, and the agonising monthly pain returned. She quickly became pregnant but went on to suffer two miscarriages. Sandra says: ‘It’s something that runs in my family — my mother had five miscarriages. I had surgery after mine, which left scar tissue in my fallopian tubes, so we began fertility treatment. ‘When I was on Clomid, the drug used to stimulate ovulation during IVF, I didn’t get the pain, which was strange. I’ve no idea why. 'Anovulation' is the term used when no ovulation takes place. Causes can included drastic weight loss and polycystic ovaries . ‘But once I’d come off it, having decided to adopt our two children rather than go through more treatment, the pain returned.’ Sandra has now gone back on the Pill to try to end her misery. Meanwhile, Suzanne Baum, 41, who lives in North-West London with her lawyer husband Lewis Cohen, 40, and their three sons, has suffered from ovulation pain for several days a month since her early 20s. She believes it has affected her mentally as well as physically. ‘When I was 22 and got engaged to Lewis, I began to get pain in my right side,’ she says. ‘Friends and family were saying it was down to stress about the engagement, or that it could be appendicitis. ‘But my father is a surgeon and he knew it couldn’t be appendicitis because I didn’t have a temperature, I still had my appetite and I could sleep though the pain.’ Looking forward to menopause: Sandra's symptoms will cease when she stops having her period . For the next few years, Suzanne went backwards and forwards to her GP as well as some of the top private gynaecologists in the country. But despite a multitude of tests, no one even mentioned ovulation pain. ‘I had endless scopes and scans and they ruled out everything, including ovarian cysts and gallstones,’ she says. ‘The physical side was bad enough, but it impacted me more emotionally. ‘I wouldn’t say I was depressed but I didn’t want to socialise while I had it because I was exhausted with the pain — and friends didn’t seem to understand. ‘I’d be so tired that sometimes I couldn’t even walk to school to pick up my children. No amount of painkillers helped.’ The agony stopped  during all of Suzanne’s pregnancies — with Zack, now 13, Leo, 12, and Jake, four. She says: ‘After I’d had my third child, it stopped for several years and I forgot all about it. But then a year ago it returned. ‘The pains felt random but I suppose it was between days 8-12 of my cycle, and it would last until I had ovulated. ‘From what I can gather, that’s quite extreme for ovulation pain — most women only suffer it for a few hours.’ Then last year, Suzanne’s father was discussing her symptoms with colleagues when someone mentioned ovulation pain. Suzanne looked it up online. ‘Straight away I knew that must be what I had because the symptoms matched mine,’ she says. ‘It made me feel slightly better psychologically to know there was a name for the condition I was suffering and that it wasn’t anything sinister.’ Like Sandra, Suzanne has been advised to go back on the Pill. Sandra says: ‘I’m 39 now and I suppose I’ll have to deal with this pain until I hit the menopause, which, if my mum is anything to go by, will be around 48. ‘I’m not looking forward to the hot flushes — but it will at least solve the ovulation pain.’","Sandra Hastings suffers acute pain during ovulation, which leaves her irritable and quick to anger .

"These unique photographs taken during the First World War by a British sailor show the biggest manmade explosion in history, when two warships crashed into one another, killing 2,000 people. The photos, taken by Royal Navy Lt Victor Magnus, have emerged nearly 100 years after they were taken and show the moment a French and Norwegian ship dramatically collided in what has become known as 'The Halifax Explosion'. During the incident, the SS Mont-Blanc - a ship from France fully loaded with wartime explosives - collided with SS Imo from Norway. The French ship then blew up, nearly wiping out an entire district. A set of unique photographs taken during the First World War by a British sailor shows the biggest manmade explosion in history . The images show the moment two warships collided into each another in December 1917, triggering an explosion which killed nearly 2,000 people . During the incident, the SS Mont-Blanc - a ship from France fully loaded with wartime explosives - collided with SS Imo from Norway . Experts say the blast was the largest manmade explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons - with an equivalent force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT. Amateur photographer Victor, who was based in Halifax in the Canadian state of Nova Scotia, was said to 'always had a camera around his neck' and was able to grab a series of shots of the original 'big bang'. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, who discovered them among photo albums in a drawer. She had no idea a slice of history had been gathering dust in her home for nearly 100 years. Mrs Foreman, from Hayle in Cornwall, who served in the land army, will take them to the Imperial War Museum, London, next month to have the photos looked at. She said: 'My father was a great photographer. He always had a camera around his neck. He would take photos all the time. He never asked anyone to pose or anything. He just snapped away. 'It was just a coincidence that he was at the Halifax disaster. The actual explosion was a a massive amount of smoke. Experts say the blast, the aftermath of which is shown here, was the largest manmade explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons . 'The Halifax Explosion' had an equivalent force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT and left a a trail of destruction in its wake . The photos were taken by Royal Navy Lt Victor Magnus, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, - the young sailor 'always had a camera around his neck' 'He was very lucky to survive, especially as it destroyed the town. He took some photos on the shore and it looked like the London Blitz. 'The whole situation of finding the photos has made it very real. I'm just so proud of him. He never talked about this and this is the first time seeing them. It's extraordinary.' After the war, Victor went back to his job as a Marine Underwriter in Essex, before serving in the home guard during the Second World War. Although later leaving the role to become an apple farmer, he always loved the sea and was the Commodore of Essex Yacht Club. He was married for his whole life, had three children and six grandchildren, and died in 1969. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, from Hayle, Cornwall, who discovered them among photo albums . The explosion, at 9.04am on Thursday December 6, 1917, happened in the the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the French ship then ignited her explosive cargo causing a cataclysmic explosion that devastated the Richmond District of Halifax. It was so powerful it almost wiped out the entire town and around 2,000 people were killed by debris, fires, and collapsed buildings and more than 9,000 injured. 1.

Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion on 11 July 2011: 2-3.2 kt of TNT (9-13 TJ) 7. Port Chicago disaster on 17 July 1944: 1.6-2.2 kt of TNT (7-9 TJ) Two ships, one loaded with explosive, struck each other while the town shock with horror. SS Mont Blanc was described as a huge 'floating bomb' because of her formidable cargo. There were more than 2,000 tonnes of picric acid, 200 tonnes of TNT, 56 tonnes of gun cotton and 223 tonnes of motor fuel on board. Records show the ship exploded and disintegrated in seconds. Altogether 3.8 sq km (1.5 sq miles) of Halifax was flattened in an instant and more than 1,900 people perished. The SS Mont Blanc was completely destroyed, with its hull launched 1,000ft in the air, while the SS Imo survived and returned to service in 1918. As the ships collided, Lt Montague was on the shore with his camera in hand, snapping the event. His daughter is expected to visit the Imperial War Museum on December 2, where an expert will talk through the photos with her. Dr Robb Robinson, a lecturer in Maritime History at Hull University, said: 'It was 1917 and the Germans had just unleashed submarine warfare, causing massive problems for the allies. There was a big push by the Germans to win the war. 'To try and stop this, the allies launched a convoy system with ships staying sailing close to each other. This left them vulnerable to collision. 'Secondly, so many ships had been sunk that ships that weren't right for the job were being used. 'Thirdly, they were drawing increasingly on Canada and the USA for ammunition, so ships were being filled with ammunition before sailing over. 'It lead to the most devastating explosion there had every been at the time. Before Hiroshima, every explosion was judged on how it compared to Halifax. 'This explosion was a precursor of things to come throughout the century.'","Photos, which emerged nearly 100 years after the event, show the moment two ships collided, killing 2,000 people .

"We know London was the capital of fashion in the Swinging Sixties. But, judging from the garments on show at a new exhibition at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, the capital was also top of the style league 300 years ago. Though the 1660s were a dark time with deadly plague and the Great Fire destroying huge parts of the capital, it was also a period when haute couture reigned on the streets as much as the Stuart monarchs did from their palaces. Glamour: Frances Theresa Stewart, the Duchess of Richmond, displays ample cleavage in this plunging gold dress, one of a number of examples of 16th and 17th-century fashion on show at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace . If only they'd had a cat walk: Anne of Denmark and Queen Henrietta Maria . What's inside? Queen Mary II's patch box, made of enameled gold and set with diamonds, circa 1694 . The exhibition, at Buckingham Palace, celebrates an age when heaving cleavage and discrete beauty spots were a must for every female, and even the smartest man had no trouble sporting swirls of flouncy lace. It features more than 60 portraits of monarchs from the Tudor and Stuart eras juxtaposed with sculpture, jewellery and even some rare clothing from the era to examine the fashions of the time. The exhibition opens with familiar portraits of Henry VIII and his three kids, but nearby panels focus on their impressive and symbolic clothing. Princess Elizabeth, considered illegitimate at the time of this painting, is wearing the most regal of gold-threaded silks below her rich, crimson gown. To reflect the first fashion publications that emerged in the reign of Charles II, The Royal Collection Trust has published Robe, a glossy fashion magazine set in May 1667, and has invited comments from modern-day fashionistas. It looks at topical fashion quandaries of the day such as the best ways to wear pearls, whether to decorate gloves with embroidery or ribbons and how to cover up smallpox scars.

"At first glance, this photo appears to show a parrot perching on a tree - sporting a curved beak, colourful feathers and a pointed tail. But, in fact, it is a woman whose entire body has been cleverly painted to resemble the tropical bird. The spectacular work of art was created by Johannes Stoetter, a former world champion body painter. Scroll down for video . Look closer: This parrot is, in fact, a woman whose body has been cleverly painted to resemble the tropical bird . The 35-year-old artist, who lives in Italy, spent four weeks painstakingly planning how he could transform the female model into a parrot. He took four hours to paint the woman's body using special breathable paint - adding intricate detail, dark shading and even a bright green eye. He then spent a further hour positioning her on a tree trump, before taking a series of photographs. The finished creation sees the model's outstretched left leg become the parrot's tail feathers, while her right leg and arm become its wings .

Concentration: He painted the woman's body using special breathable paint - adding intricate detail and colours . And her left arm - wrapped around her head - forms the tropical bird's head. Mr Stoetter, who was crowned World Body Painting Champion in 2012, said he had chosen to position the model on a tree stump to enhance the 'parrot's' life-like appearance. 'Getting . the scene set up took about five hours, then it took about another four . hours to paint the model and an hour to get her position right,' he said. Incredible: The finished creation sees the model's outstretched left leg become the parrot's tail feathers, while her right leg and arm become its wings. Her left arm - wrapped around her head - forms the tropical bird's head . 'It . was quite hard to take the photo, to tell the model how to pose to make . the parrot seem as real as possible and also to find the right point of . view for me to take the photo. 'It was not easy for the model to hold the position either. The whole process took about four weeks from start to finish.' He added: 'I feel very happy with the final work. Most people’s reaction are “nice photo of a parrot, where did you photograph it?” Makeover: Mr Stoetter said even his closest friends often mistake his creation for a photo of a real-life parrot . 'Even some of my closest friends who know me and my art didn’t notice that it is not a real parrot. 'When they found out, they were really amazed, stunned and surprised.' It is not the first time the artist has created a stunning piece of artwork using a person's body.

"Police have found the bodies of four women and a baby after storming a 12-acre compound controlled by thousands of devotees of Indian 'godman' Rampal Maharaj. The religious guru is wanted by police on charges that include murder and is believed to be holed up inside the sprawling compound in northern India where his followers are hiding him while they try to fight off police. When police arrived, thousands of followers fled the ashram claiming they had been held at the compound against their will. But hundreds of others used stones, petrol bombs and other weapons to try and beat back the invading police. Scroll down for video .

Police, armed with heavy sticks, drag a bloody man away from the scene of the violent clashes . Director general of police SN Vashisht said the bodies of four women were found at the sprawling compound but it was unclear how they died, while an 18-month-old child appeared to have died of natural causes. Another woman apparently suffering from a heart condition also died after being taken to hospital, Vashisht said. 'All dead bodies have been sent to the hospital where they will undergo a postmortem to ascertain the exact cause of their deaths.' Police stepped up their search today for the 63-year-old guru whom they believe is still holed up inside the compound spread over 12-acres. They were also checking those leaving the ashram in case Rampal, who considers himself an incarnation of the 15th-century mystic poet Kabir, was hiding in the crowd. Police yesterday stormed the ashram, which has been guarded by hundreds of followers for days after a court ordered their leader arrested on murder and other charges. Police fired water canon and tear gas and baton-charged the supporters who were armed with stones, petrol bombs and other weapons, television footage showed.

Here, police are pictured detaining one of his supporters . Followers leaving the compound have been dropped off at nearby bus and train stations, Jashandeep Singh, the assistant police superintendent, said. 'What started as a trickle hasn't yet stopped and we have dropped off around 10,000 people at nearby bus and train stations. He added: 'The people who left the ashram mostly said that they were being held against their will, as a shield for the guru against any police action.' Police are seeking Rampal's arrest after he repeatedly refused court orders to appear to answer charges including conspiracy to murder, inciting mobs and contempt of court. India has been rocked by several scandals involving immensely popular 'godmen', mostly Hindu ascetics who claim to possess mystical powers. Last year one was charged with sexually assaulting a schoolgirl. For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often give donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects.","Police find bodies of four women and a baby after storming compound .

"Ever wondered why cat urine is so pungent, or what causes felines to react so strongly to catnip? You’re not alone. Now a video reveals the answers - explaining how the psychoactive plant used in catnip works as well as revealing how litter is able to absorb the smell of the urine and clump faeces together. ‘One of the finest joys for cat owners is the feline insanity that comes from catnip,’ said the expert from the American Chemical Society. Scroll down for video . High: The video explained that catnip is made from a plant called nepeta cataria pictured). Its psychoactive quality comes from a compound known as nepetalactone, which binds to the olfactory receptors in a cat’s nose. This compound triggers a neurological response, similar to how cats react to sexual pheromones . Its high can last between 10 minutes to an hour, and around 70 per cent of cats are affected by the treat. The video explained that catnip is made from a plant called nepeta cataria, closely related to mint and, as a result, is often called catmint.

The surprisingly complex chemistry of at litter is explained next. Cat urine gets its unique smell from a compound called felinine. Cat urine gets its unique smell from a compound called felinine. Felinine is broken down into a sulphur called MMB, and male cats use MMB as a pheromone to let females know they are ready to mate.

Bacteria in cat faeces typically converts uric acid into ammonia, which gives the urine its smell.

Internet users believe that a quirk of feline psychology means they will sit in circles because they identify it as new territory that requires protecting. It’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes, carrier bags or cupboards . A group of cat owners claims to have found a foolproof way to get cats to do their bidding: simply by drawing a circle on the floor. The cat, they say, instinctively feels compelled to go and sit inside it. According to the theory, cats find circles or similar shapes on the ground irresistible. So if you mark one out - around 2ft (0.6 metres) across -  using chalk, string, masking tape or flex, a cat will enter the circle and refuse to leave. The reason behind this phenomenon, however, is unknown. It’s well known that cats enjoy the safety of enclosed spaces - such as boxes, carrier bags or cupboards - and equally like perching on high spots where they can keep an eye on the world. It’s also established that they have favourite spots in the home. Animal behaviour expert Professor Daniel Mills told MailOnline cats could be attracted to circles if they formed a barrier, for instance, if they were made of a curled-up draught excluder, tea towels or a row of socks. ‘Low barriers can give a cat a sense of security because the cat can cower down,’ says the Lincoln University academic. ‘If you take a cat to the vet and it is put in an unfamiliar cage, it will often sit in a litter tray if there is one inside the cage. ‘The probable reason is that the sides of the tray are raised and they can get their eyes below the level. They don’t realise that their ears are sticking up.’ That could explain the lure of a raised circle, but not a two- dimensional mark on the floor. Artificial scents are typically used in the litter to counteract these smells, and silica gels are also included to absorb urine. Calcium bentonite is added to create what the video calls ‘litter clump’, which, as the name suggests, it clumps faeces together to make it easier to find and remove from the tray. And when it comes to marking their territory, glands in a cat’s face, tails, paws and lower back are used to rub against objects. This is also used to establish and feel familiarity with objects in the home. For example, when cats rub up against a person, they are showing affection while telling other cats that the person belongs to them. The video is part of a series, created by ACS, called Reactions.

"The average pensioner living in a developed country is less likely to suffer from dementia today than in the past, doctors say. Studies show that the risk of the disease seems to be falling in the UK, US and other wealthy nations. The increased use of blood pressure and cholesterol-busting drugs and better standards of education are credited with keeping the brain sharper for longer. Rates of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are falling in the developed world - but increasing in poorer nations, new research has shown. Image shows a brain with Alzheimer's . However, a major Alzheimer’s conference heard that there is no room for complacency. The . ageing population means the number of cases is still rising in rich . countries, while the number of people with dementia in the developing . world is thought to have been severely underestimated. And improvements in brain health in recent years could be jeopardised by the rising tide of obesity. A . series of studies have shown that a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s and . other forms of dementia is falling in the US and Europe, the Alzheimer’s . Association International Conference in Copenhagen heard. A US . government-funded study found that an American aged 60-plus today is . almost half as likely to develop dementia than someone of a similar age . did roughly 30 years ago. The fall in risk has been particularly . steep in women, and the average age at which dementia is diagnosed has . risen – from 80 in the 1970s to 85 today. A similar British analysis, . published in the Lancet medical journal last year, found the chances of . developing dementia in old age have fallen by almost a quarter since . the 1990s. Studies from Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands show a . similar pattern. It is thought that the increasing number of drugs . prescribed to combat heart disease is helping to keep dementia at bay by . keeping the brain healthy. The fall in smoking, another risk factor for . dementia, is also likely to have helped. Experts say rates of dementia are falling thanks to risk factors for the disease - such as high blood pressure and cholesterol - are better controlled . And increasing access to . education is thought to be vital, with studies showing that the longer a . person spends at school and university the slower their descent into . the disease. More challenging careers have a similar protective effect. Claudia Satizabal, of Boston  University, who compiled the US figures, . said greater equality in the job market could help explain  why rates . have fallen particularly among women. ‘The results bring some hope that perhaps dementia cases may be preventable or at least delayed,’ she added. ‘The number of people aged 65 and older is going to almost treble . in the next 40 years worldwide. This means that dementia is still going . to be front and centre as a public health issue' - Dr Kenneth Langa . Dr . Kenneth Langa, a University of Michigan expert on ageing who spoke at . the conference, said: ‘For an individual, the actual risk of dementia . seems to have declined. ‘I believe the evidence is pretty strong that . lifestyle changes, especially increasing physical activity, maintaining . a healthy weight, eating a healthy Mediterranean diet, and controlling . one’s blood pressure, can help reduce the risk of dementia. ‘On a . societal level, increasing opportunities for children to have good . educations and keep their brains active and stimulated also seems . important for reducing dementia risk later in life.’ However, Dr Langa pointed out that the ageing population means the total number of cases is still on the rise. He . said: ‘The number of people aged 65 and older is going to almost treble . in the next 40 years worldwide. This means that dementia is still going . to be front and centre as a public health issue.’ Others warned that the obesity epidemic could undo the progress. Previous . research has shown that those who are obese in middle-age are almost . four times as likely to develop dementia in old age as those who keep . their weight in check. The exact reasons are unknown but high blood . pressure and cholesterol associated with obesity could interrupt the . brain’s blood supply, while hormones and other chemicals released by fat . stores may harm the brain. Rebecca Wood, chief executive of . Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘While there is no simple way  to prevent . the condition, it is positive to see that improvements in  healthcare . for other conditions could be helping to stem the tide  of dementia. ‘Time will tell whether rising trends in obesity could set back this progress in the coming years.’","Average American over 60 has 44% lower risk of disease than 30 years ago .

"White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied on Thursday a television news reporter's day-old claim that reporters often 'provide the questions to him in advance,' before his daily briefings, and that he sometimes provides answers on paper before taking the podium. WIthin hours, the Phoenix reporter at the center of a quick-drying controversy admitted she got the whole thing wrong. Phoenix news anchor Catherine Anaya reported Wednesday night on KPHO-TV5 that in an 'off the record' meeting, Carney had told a handful of local TV reporters that White House correspondents often tell him before daily briefings what they'll be asking. 'If only this were true,' Carney told MailOnline Thursday morning. By mid-afternoon Anaya, fresh of a Washington-to-Phoenix flight, walked parts of her story back in an email to MailOnline. But she insisted that she herself was asked to submit a question in advance for Carney on Wednesday afternoon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . KPHO-TV anchor Catherine Anaya went to Washington to participate in a carefully managed television journalism cattle-call at the White House, and reported that Press Secretary Jay Carney's daily briefings are often just for show . Carney denied getting a heads-up about daily briefing questions: 'If only this were true' 'As a local journalist I had no issue providing my proposed question in advance,' she told MailOnline, 'because I wanted to make sure it was an appropriate q[uestion] for a national briefing and I wanted to make sure it was appropriate for Mr. Carney.' '[B]ut in discussing it with a staff member the night before, we decided I would save it for the president. I was attempting to not waste national time on a local question, but in my attempt at explaining that I unintentionally made it sound like that experience applied to everyone.' 'That is my mistake,' Anaya added, 'and I own up to it.' Meanwhile, KPHO-TV issued a separate statement attributed to Anaya, but the CBS affiliate station quickly deleted it from its website. Assignment Editor Scott Davis told MailOnline that it 'apparently ... was not the correct statement.' Anaya's on-air commentary remains on the website, however. 'We started here shortly after 8 o'clock with a coffee with Press Secretary Jay Carney inside his office in the West Wing,' she said on the air, before making a stunning breach of journalistic protocol by reporting on an 'off the record' meeting and airing a photo of it. KPHO-TV . issued this extended quote Thursday afternoon from Catherine Anaya, and . then quickly withdrew it, saying in an email that 'apparently that was . not the correct statement': . 'It seems much had been inferred about my observations following my White House visit yesterday. 'First, . I did not take notes during our coffee with Jay Carney because it was . off the record. But when I referenced the meeting in my live reports I . did say that it was a great opportunity to talk about the challenges of . his day and how he has to be so well-versed on many topics each day. 'In . my live report I also wanted to share my impression of my experience in . getting a question answered during the briefing. I was indeed asked to . provide my question in advance. Because my question was largely of local . interest, I chose to save it for my interview with the President . instead. 'My mistake was to . lump that experience with my coffee meeting reference, inadvertently . giving Mr. Carney credit for that when in fact it did not come from him. I regret giving anyone the impression that it was from conversation I . had with Mr. Carney. I do not attend those briefings regularly and cannot speak directly to the process for non-visiting journalists. None of my observations stemmed from my off-the-record meeting with Jay Carney.' 'And this was off-the-record,' she . reported, 'so we were able to ask him all about some of the preparation . that he does on a regular basis for talking to the press in his daily . press briefings. He showed us a very long list of items that he has to . be well-versed on every single day.' 'And then he also mentioned that a lot of times,' Anaya added, 'unless it's something breaking, the questions that the reporters actually ask – or the correspondents – they are provided to him in advance.' 'So then he knows what he's going to be answering and sometimes those correspondents and reporters also have those answers printed in front of them, because of course it helps when they're producing their reports for later on.' Anaya responded to a request for comment hours later. Davis initially told MailOnline that she was on a plane and unavailable. But the White House was quick to dismiss her account of what Carney said. Carney himself tweeted a second denial after this report was first published. Anaya's recounting of her day at the White House aired Wednesday in at least two separate on-air reports. One was uploaded to a hastily created YouTube account and then reported by The Weekly Standard. It's unknown who published that video online. Hours after deleting the anchor's hastily issued statement KPHO-TV released a second one: . 'Last night during my live reports from the White House I attempted to describe the highlights of the day. I was speaking off the cuff and unscripted and in the process I made two major mistakes: I reported an off the record conversation and what I reported was not accurate. 'I took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing. I incorrectly applied the process to everyone. That was wrong and it was bad reporting. But it was not intentional and I would never purposely report inaccurate information. 'The White House never asked for my questions in advance and never instructed me what to ask. I chose to provide one of my questions in advance of the press briefing because I wanted to make sure it would have broad appeal. I did not attribute or report factually last night and for that I deeply apologize. 'I pride myself on truth and objectivity. I sincerely regret any harm I've caused and I hope that you will continue to place your trust in the hardworking journalists who make up CBS 5 News.' Anaya published this photo of what she said was an 'off the record' meeting Wednesday morning with Carney, during which -- she claims -- he said he often receives daily briefing questions in advance . Obama conducted his interviews Wednesday with several local news anchors standing up, Anaya said, so the brief Q&A sessions could be kept to a 4-minute limit . A longer broadcast segment, in which Anaya makes the same claim about Carney's advance knowledge of daily briefing questions, is the one on KPHO's website. 'They provide the questions to him in advance,' she said in that report. 'And so he is already preparing for the answer. And sometimes – in some cases, I should say – he actually prepares that answer for them, so that they can have that to work on their reports later on.' Anaya also told viewers that she was limited to four minutes for her brief encounter with the president, but 'stretched it to six.' At the beginning of KPHO's video, she's seen glancing off-camera to see if her time has started. The interview was conducted with both parties standing up in the White House Diplomatic Room. 'The reason why we're standing, I was told by one of his staffers, is because he likes to get comfortable when he's sitting, and he tends to get very chatty,' she said. 'And so this was another way to keep him – and us – at the four minutes that they were suggesting that we not go over.' 'Yeah,' responded anchor Adam Longo, 'and it sounds like the pressure is on when some guy is standing behind him with a countdown clock. That's a little ridiculous.'","Catherine Anaya of KPHO-TV in Phoenix claimed Carney told reporters that White House correspondents often tell him their questions ahead of time .

"The House stenographer who had to be dragged out of the chamber last October after a religious rant at the end of the government shutdown debate has released a video statement in which she says that she didn’t ‘lose her mind’ or ‘have a breakdown’. Dianne Reidy, who has since been fired, said the spirit of the Lord had spoken through her, telling her in advance that she was going to speak somewhere in the House chamber during the big vote. The YouTube video released on Saturday is the 48-year-old’s first public statement since the bizarre incident brought an end to the televised vote to reopen the government after a shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. Scroll down for video . Dianne Reidy, who has since been fired, said the spirit of the Lord had spoken through her, telling her in advance that she was going to speak somewhere in the House chamber during the big vote . Outburst: Dianne Reidy is forcibly removed from the House chamber after her about God and the Freemasons . The 38-minute YouTube video features Reidy, together with her husband Dan, sitting on a couch with a single page of notes. Dan speaks for the first couple of minutes, citing several Bible verses. He said the video is to ‘explain what took place in Dianne’s life and our lives last fall.’ Dianne Reidy then speaks about her recollections of the incident. ‘I remember getting up to the podium and after saying, “God will not be mocked.” I don’t have a memory of anything else that was said that evening until I was escorted off the floor,’ she said. ‘I knew that God was going to speak through me, and I knew it was going to be during the vote, raising the debt ceiling level and ending the government shutdown.’ The YouTube clip features Diane Reidy, together with her husband Dan, who cited several Bible versions during the video . Messenger: Dianne Reidy said she was prompted to speak by the Holy Spirit . Her husband said he was fully supportive of his wife’s actions and that ‘Dianne and I are both Bible-believing Christians.’ ‘We . believe it was Dianne that was being carried along by the spirit of God . in speaking to the representatives that evening,’ he said. Reidy . was taken to George Washington University Hospital where a resident . diagnosed the incident as anxiety and a religious experience. However, . her doctor the next day said she suffered from psychosis. During the vote on legislation to end the debt deadlock, Reidy began shouting about God, Freemasons and a 'House divided'. 'He will not be mocked. He will not be mocked- don't touch me- He will not be mocked,' she had called out. 'The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. Had it been it would not have been. It would not have been. 'The Constitution would not have been written by Freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God. Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be to Jesus.' Video: Watch Dianne's testimony . Proud: Dan Reidy, pictured with is wife Dianne, and daughters, blamed the long working hours on the outburst . On her Facebook page, Mrs Reidy is a fan of several Christian-oriented groups, including the evangelical In Touch Ministries, led by TV preacher Charles Stanley. She does not drink, do drugs or have any medication issues, and was released from the hospital. 'I’m glad that I fulfilled God’s mission for me, absolutely. It lifted a tremendous burden. It was a very hard burden to carry as you can imagine,' she said in an interview with The New York Post. Her husband spoke for the majority of the interview, saying that the late nights that she worked during the shutdown drove her to the brink. 'God was preparing her for this vote . last night, because this was kind of the culmination of everything,' Mr Reidy told The Post. 'This . was the big one. Everybody’s there. And Dianne didn’t know what she was . sharing, she didn’t know when — but she just sensed in her spirit.' Mrs Reidy has worked as a stenographer for two decades and the past eight of those years were for the House Clerk- a job she reportedly enjoys because she appreciates the archaic parliamentary order to the ways that laws are passed and debates are organized. Mr Reidy told The Daily Beast that his wife took her job so seriously that she refused to call in sick even when she was suffering from morning sickness while pregnant with the couple's twin daughters. 'This whole mess has just kind of sickened her to the whole process,' he said of her disgust with what had been going on during the federal shutdown. 'The alliances between people who aren’t really allies. The finger-pointing on the dais, [then] the arms around each other… Where are the people being served in this whole deal? 'She was just like, ""Gosh, this is not what it’s about.""' Attention: Those in earshot of Mrs Reidy could be seen looking at her during the outburst . The couple are open about their devout . religious beliefs. 'Reading a Bible is not foreign to us, but getting . up in the middle of the night definitely is. It’s just not a part of our . life,' Mr Reidy told the Daily Beast. 'What . she was finding out was that God was impressing on her heart that He . had a message He wanted her to share with the House of Representatives.' CSPAN was recording the scene and had . the screen blocked with the breakdown of the vote that had just happened . to approve the debt ceiling increase and temporary budget agreement. Though it was not a clear shot, it was possible to see Mrs Reidy approach the microphone and begin gesticulating. A GOP aide told CNN: 'She’s a well-known person, she’s a perfectly nice person, a good colleague, somebody who’s respectable and dependable, and this is very surprising to everybody who works with her. I don't know, she just snapped.'","Dianne Reidy started yelling about God's message and the Constitution shortly after the debt ceiling vote in the House of Representatives last Oct .

"New research from the Alaska Climate Research Center shows that since the beginning of the 21st century, temperatures in the snow covered land of Alaska are actually getting colder - bucking the overall global warming trend. In the Last Frontier, where temperatures can get as cold as 50 degrees below zero, local residents have experienced the increasing chill and scientists now confirm that the Northwest state is indeed seeing a temperature drop. A new report from the research center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks reveals that the 49th state of the union has cooled by 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 2000. Colder: Since 1977, the mean annual temperature has been steadily rising but starting in the early 2000s that has been falling . Data: Scientists reviewed weather reports from 20 climate stations operated by NOAA across the state to determine that it is in fact getting colder in the Last Frontier . The drop is described as a 'large value for a decade,' in the academic paper 'The First Decade of the New Century: A Cooling Trend for Most of Alaska.' Scientists based their research on temperature readings from weather stations operated by the National Weather Service. These stations are scattered across the state and represent the different climatic zones present. Based on the readings, 19 of the 20 stations have measured a consistently cooler climate over time. The region most impacted by chillier temps is Western Alaska, notably King Salmon on the Alaska Peninsula. That region saw temperatures drop most sharply by 4.5 degrees for the decade. Amazing cold: An average of 40 inches to 100 inches of snow fall in Alaska each year. This man struggles to get out of his home in Cordova, Alaska after a massive storm in Jan 2012 . Ice everywhere: Scientists say that temperatures in the Northwest state have fallen over the past decade in Alaska (pictured: an ice covered home in Jan. 2012 in the fishing town of Cordova, Alaska) In the paper, researchers credit an ocean phenomenon, called the Decadal Oscillation, with bringing colder surface water temperatures and thus beginning the overall cooling effect. This oscillation has brought a weakening of the Aleutian Low, the breeding ground for storms that end up regulating weather systems in the rest of the 48 states. With a less active Aleutian Low, cold winter storms have been sticking around Alaska longer and keeping the temperatures chilly. This climate shift could shed new light on the long feared impact of dangerous greenhouse gases causing a rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and the thawing of arctic glaciers and sea ice. Before the 2000s, the warming trend in Alaska has actually been twice the overall warming rate. The sudden temperature increase began in 1977 and has gone up ever since 1998. But now the trend has been reversed, with the mean temperature dropping. Don Hatten, a National Weather Service forecaster, said local residents have noticed the colder temps but joked that when you're  'already bundled up for 20-below' a few degrees colder doesn't have as much of an impact, he told the Alaska Dispatch. Mr Hatten also pointed out that for the first time in 2011, due to the colder weather, the Bering Sea ice shelf extended nearly to the edge of the Alaska Peninsula. Though the chill has hit most areas of the state, there is one exception. The Northern region of the state, in the town of Barrow, has actually seen temperatures rise since the region is secluded by the Brooks Mountain Range. The mountain range originates on the far northwest end of the state and stretches 700 miles into Canada's Yukon Territory. In Barrow, temperatures were actually 3.1 degrees higher.","Since 2000, temperatures in Alaska have dropped by 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit .

A group of friends have launched Britain's first darts team for the blind, by using string to help them find the bullseye . Rachael Beresford -  a member of the 'The Optimists' Dart team at the Dolphin Inn in Grampound, Cornwall. The team guide their darts with a piece of string attached to the board .

Then when a player heads to the line they grab the cord with their spare hand and throw with the other. The friends have been hard at work honing their skills, ready for their first match, and father-of-two Mr Pryor, 68, said they are now hitting the board about two out of every three throws. The former social worker said: 'The landlord mentioned that the Rotary Club had organised for pubs to take part in a fast darts competition. 'He asked if we wanted to put in a blind darts team. After three pints I am up for anything and we said yes. 'No one has been injured yet, although there has been quite a bit of damage to the door and around the board. 'Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's the end of the world. I have been blind for nearly 40 years and I have a superb time, I wouldn't swap it for anything. 'However, on the night people might want to stand back a little bit as I don't think we get any points for hitting the spectators.' Mr Pryor went completely blind over the course of three days when his retinas haemorrhaged irreversibly and without warning 38 years ago. But he refuses to give up on his favourite hobbies and activities, and organises a monthly support group for the blind and visually impaired. Sharon Waters lines up a shot.  The four wholly visually impaired teammates will take part in their first game on Thursday . Team member Carol Pirret has the best vision of the group but is still partially sighted due to a condition called Pseudoxanthoma elasticum or PXE . Ms Pirret said: 'I'm very excited for the competition, it's the only social thing I really do. It's a good bit of fun joining in the darts team' It was through this group that he advertised for players and was soon swamped with volunteers. Team mate Sharon Walters, 46, a mum-of-two and former carer, has serious visual impairment due to a benign brain tumour. Rachael Beresford, 39, a DJ and former hospice volunteer, is completely blind due to glaucoma and diabetes. Making up the foursome is Carol Pirret, 53, who has the best vision of the group but is still partially sighted due to a condition called Pseudoxanthoma elasticum or PXE. The team have until Thursday to perfect their technique before they take part in the fast darts contest, where teams score as many points as possible in 90 minutes. There are 14 other clubs taking part this year - but all the others can see. Ms Walters said: 'Seeing as it's for charity I thought, ""Oh why not?"" It's going to be fun, I think, but I don't fancy our chances.' Team founder Richard Pryor said the friends have been hard at work honing their skills, ready for their first match, and are now hitting the board about two out of every three throws . He said: 'Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's the end of the world.

Ms Pirret said: 'I'm very excited for the competition, it's the only social thing I really do. It's a good bit of fun joining in the darts team.' Mrs Beresford played darts before losing her sight. She added: 'I used to play for fun and it's great to give it another go. I didn't think I would be able to do it but so far I'm getting most of them on the board.' Donna Fryer, 41, landlady of the 17th-century Dolphin Inn, said she wasn't too worried about the damage caused by stray arrows. She said: 'I think it's great they are entering the competition. 'They support us so often, by coming in here for their meetings. It's great to be able to support them back by letting them play in the competition here. 'There's been a few holes in the walls, but that doesn't matter - it all adds to the character of the pub.'","The team say they have caused damage to the inside of their local pub The Dolphin Inn in Grampound, Cornwall, while honing their skills .

"Chef: The Duchess of Cambridge has asked for a second kitchen in the couple's new Kensington Palace apartment . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have installed a second kitchen in their new Kensington Palace apartment, it was revealed yesterday. The existing 350 sq ft kitchen, originally designed by Princess Margaret’s husband, Lord Snowdon, has been refurbished at a reported cost to taxpayers of £170,000. But William and Kate also wanted a ‘private, family kitchen’ in the four-storey, 20-plus room home. The cost of reconfiguring the room from existing office space has also fallen to the public purse, but officials stressed last night that the second kitchen itself, as well as all fixtures and fittings, were paid for by the couple. Asked whether Prince Charles might have helped his son pay for the new kitchen, a Clarence House spokesman said: ‘Many young couples when doing up houses seek help from their parents or grandparents. There may have been some assistance.’ Details of the Cambridges’ domestic arrangements were revealed yesterday in an annual briefing on the Royal Family’s finances, where it was disclosed that the Queen is to receive a generous 5 per cent rise in public funding next year. A new deal with the Government means the amount of money given to the Queen to undertake her public duties and the upkeep of all royal residences is now being taken from a single pot of money known as the Sovereign Grant, which she can spend as she wishes. This is drawn from a 15 per cent slice of the profits of the Crown Estate, a portfolio of land, holdings and investments worth more than £9 billion, that was handed to the Government by the Crown two centuries ago. Record profits means the monarch’s income will increase from £36.1 million in 2013/14 to an inflation-busting £37.9 million in 2014/15. But aides insist the monarchy still offers good value for money – just 56p per  person each year, or just over 1p per week. ‘We try to get the best value as possible from the public funds entrusted to us,’ said the Queen’s ‘money man’, Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sir Alan Reid. Inevitably, however, it is how her family spends that money that will come under most scrutiny. Work in progress: Including the removal of asbestos, the final bill will . be nearly £4.5million, although Clarence House stressed the second . kitchen will be paid for by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Yesterday palace officials confirmed that the total public bill for renovations on Apartment 1A, the new home of the future king and his wife which takes up more than half of one of the palace’s wings, had spiralled to more than £4 million. The . Royal Family accounts also revealed that the Queen  slashed her phone . bill in half – to £100,000 for the year – after  staff renegotiated . their mobile phone contract. Sir . Alan Reid, in charge of the Queen’s finances, saw his salary rise by a . generous £10,000 to £190,000, while the Queen’s private secretary, Sir . Christopher Geidt, was given a £9,000 pay hike. Pay for senior staff had been frozen in recent years. Adding the cost of removing asbestos from the property takes the bill closer to £4.5 million. Officials said the couple had agreed that the basic cost for the restorations should come from the public purse, but they would pay for anything above that – including curtains, carpets and furniture. One aide said: ‘The Cambridges were actually extremely sensitive to the fact that public funds were being used to pay for a lot of this work. They understood that it would be a drain on public expenditure and they wanted to minimise that. ‘It is not done out to lavish standards. You would be surprised at what an ordinary level the apartment has been done to. Comfortable, but an ordinary level of furnishing.’ It is understood that all works were approved by the Queen.","Existing 350sq ft kitchen refurbished at reported cost to taxpayers of £170k .

"They may have stood guard over China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang for more than 2,000 years, but the famous terracotta warriors are still revealing their secrets. Since they were discovered by local farmers in 1974, experts have questioned whether the life-size models of soldiers were modelled on real warriors, or whether they came off a production line, with random individual details such as hairstyles, added to mark them apart. Now, experts have produced 3D computer models of the statues, focusing on their ears, which they say are unique like fingerprints, suggesting that the soldiers were modelled on specific humans. Experts have produced 3D models of 30 terracotta warriors (stock image), focusing on their ears, which they say are unique like fingerprints, suggesting that the soldiers were modelled on specific humans . A team of archaeologists from University College London (UCL) worked with experts from Emperor Qin Shi Huang's Mausoleum Site Museum in Lintong, China, to reveal the ancient design process behind the soldiers, National Geographic reported. They measured the statues’ facial features focusing on the ears, because they come in so many different shapes that they can be used to identify individuals. Experts measured the statues’ ears, because they come in so many different shapes that they can be used to identify individuals . The experts reasoned, that if the warriors depict real people, each statue should have different shaped ears. Because the statues are packed so closely together in the burial pit, they scanned the ears and made 3D reconstructions to examine them without risking damaging the ancient originals. Working from a sample of 30 models, they discovered that no two ears were precisely the same and the amount of variation resembled a real human population. ‘Based on this initial sample, the terracotta army looks like a series of portraits of real warriors,’ said UCL archaeologist Marcos Martinón-Torres. The team will now study a much larger sample of the warriors and other facial features to see if they really do seem to represent individuals. The study seems to reinforce the findings of retired German historian John Komlos, who found that the differing heights of the warriors were a close match to Chinese men measured in the 19th century. ‘That the size of the terracotta figures could well represent the true physical stature of the Chinese infantry,’ he said at the time. It is thought that the terracotta army figures were made in workshops by government workers and local craftsmen. The heads, arms, legs and torsos were crafted separately and then assembled on site. Some experts think that eight face moulds were used and then clay was added to create individual features, but there is much debate about whether the figures are modelled on individuals or were simply made to look a little different from each other. Each workshop inscribed their names on the models, as a sort of assembly line quality control measure. They are placed in the pits in realistic military formation to reflect their rank and duty - shown by different uniforms and types of weaponry, such as real metal spears, swords and crossbows. The figures were originally painted in bright colours and lacquered. Because the statues are packed so closely together in the burial pit (pictured), the scinetists scanned their ears and made 3D reconstructions to examine them without risking damaging the ancient originals . China's first emperor was buried over two thousand years ago in the most opulent tomb complex ever found in the vast country. Qin Shi Huang's colossal burial site in Xi'an, is thought to comprise some 8,000 life size human soldiers arranged in groups, plus other figures. The ancient site contains a collection of underground caverns containing everything the emperor would need for the afterlife, including reproductions of his armies, concubines, administrators and servants. The first of the life-size terracotta statues was unearthed in 1974 by farmers digging wells near Xi'an and a further 2,000 have been unearthed since. But the emperor’s burial mound has been left untouched because of fears a delicate artwork showing ancient beliefs of the afterlife, could be damaged using current archaeological methods. The site contained a poisonous mercury moat to keep out looters, and experts think further booby-traps await investigators inside the emperor's chamber. While a lot of Qin Shi Huang's vast necropolis has been uncovered, the emperor’s burial mound remains untouched. In 2012, the Chinese government said that no archaeologists will excavate the tomb until better technology is available. This is because experts think it is filled with a unique piece of art showing celestial bodies that could disintegrate if it is opened. The clues to the contents come from a work by the Chinese scholar Sima Qian. Archaeologists hope that with advancing technologies, such as robotic cameras, entry could soon be considered and the ancient secret revealed. Kristin Romey, curatorial consultant for the Terracotta Warrior exhibition at New York City’s Discovery Times Square, said: 'I wouldn’t be surprised if you had some sort of robotic visual survey going in there at some point.' Other possible hurdles to excavation include the possibility of a moat of hazardous mercury that is thought to surround Qin's central burial spot, and other possible booby-traps like rigged crossbows. The emperor is said to have planned a gruesome death for anyone who dared to disturb his slumber.

"Arrest: Christopher Sims, 30, allegedly met a girl, 11, on Facebook and encouraged her to meet . A father searching for his missing 11-year-old daughter found her with a 30-year-old man who had met her on Facebook and then raped her, police have said. Christopher Sims, 30, from Lorain, Ohio, met the young girl on Facebook last year and urged her to meet him in person, Lorain Police Detective Tabitha Angello said. She left her home, which is also in Lorain, and was reported missing by her father on February 19. She returned home on February 26 but when her father woke up the next day, she had vanished. Two days later, he was driving through . the neighborhood looking for his daughter when he saw her by Sims' apartment block, Angello said.

They . climbed in his car and the father followed as he called police. Officers pulled over Sims' car 30 minutes later and found the young girl . in the backseat, Angello said. The little girl told police that she had been staying with Sims at his house and that she and Sims had sex on February 26, police said, the Chronicle Telegram reported. On Tuesday, police executed search and . arrest warrants at Sims' house in the 400 block of Iowa Avenue and they allegedly found items relating . to the rape case. He was arrested at noon on Tuesday following the search. Caught: The girl's father was looking for her in the neighborhood and saw her and Sims (pictured left and right) get into his car together. The dad alerted police and Sims was arrested . Scene: The concerned father had seen her run into this apartment - where Sims lives - earlier in the day . Angello did not provide information about the girl's condition, but that she had been issued with a summons for being unruly when she returned home. 'We advise parents to not to get . involved' in cases, Angello told MailOnline. 'But if a father is looking for his . missing daughter, I can't stop him.' Records show Sims was previously indicted for rape, gross sexual imposition and unlawful conduct with a minor in 2010 for an incident in 2004. He had pleaded guiltyto gross sexual imposition on February 19 and is awaiting sentencing. Sims is being held at Lorain City Jail on a $1 million bond and will appear in court on March 13.","Father was looking for his daughter in Lorain, Ohio after she vanished from their home and saw her running into an apartment block .

"Honda is planning to release a hydrogen-powered car in March 2016 that, in an emergency, could even power your house. The clean-energy car called the FCV, which emits only water as a waste product, will have a range of 300 miles (480km) and seating for up to five people . But problems with hydrogen fuel, such as a lack of infrastructure to support a nationwide fleet of cars, will need to be solved before the technology is adopted. Scroll down for video . Japanese company Honda has unveiled its new FCV concept car (artist's illustration shown). The vehicle runs solely on hydrogen fuel and will be released in March 2016. Hydrogen fuel is desirable because it only emits water and heat. The zero-emission fuel is heralded as a replacement for petrol one day . Hydrogen fuel has been heralded as the future of automobiles, and possibly leading to a ‘hydrogen economy’ where many things run on the element, as it is a zero-emission fuel. Cars employing the fuel use electrochemical cells or combustion to turn it into heat, with the only by-product being water. A report by Autocar has suggested that BMW is looking to develop its own hydrogen vehicle. Rumoured to be called the i5, the vehicle would compliment the existing electric i3 and hybrid i8 in the i-brand series. Aside from Honda, the i5 would compete with other hydrogen cars from Toyota and Hyundai. And there are also rumours that Audi and Mercedes could be release hydrogen cars of their own in the not too distant future, possibly by 2017. Many car manufacturers have been toying with the idea of hydrogen cars including Toyota and BMW. And now Honda’s latest effort, the successor to their FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel car, will soon be on its way. There is no news yet on the price of the car or what its top speed will be, but the release date of March 2016 in Japan is known. Honda says a release in the US and Europe will then follow. The car has a power output of more than 100kW and an increased ‘power density’ of 60 per cent over its predecessor. This gives the car its impressive range of 300 miles (480km). The FCV also apparently has an external power feeder than, during an emergency, could be used to power an entire home. The clean-energy car called the FCV (illustration shown), which emits only water as a waste product, will have a range of 300 miles (480km) and seating for ‘up to five’ people . Coconuts could play a key role in making non-polluting cars that only emit water a reality. For years, scientists have been working out how to develop fuel cell cars powered by pure hydrogen, but are unsure how to store the substance effectively. Now, they may be close to solving this problem using the unlikely candidate. Researchers from India’s Benaras Hindu University used coconut kernels to store hydrogen in gas form. Professor Viney Dixit and his team, at the university’s Hydrogen Energy Centre created carbon from coconut kernels, which contain fatty and organic acids as well as potassium, magnesium and sodium. He says that the kernels, which are easily found, are cheap and can easily be converted into carbon. And the researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a ‘considerable’ amount of hydrogen. Honda's newly announced FCV Concept vehicle will be the successor to the FCX Calrity, seen here being refuelled at the UK's first open access hydrogen vehicle refuelling station in Swindon in 2011 . The vehicle can be refuelled in just three to five minutes, although the specialist hydrogen-fuel is not widely available at stations yet. Hydrogen itself is also a bit of a problem. Although it is widely billed as a potential replacement for petrol, pure hydrogen does not occur naturally on Earth. This means it needs to be made via other means, such as using methane, but the process is complicated. And attempts to replicate the process using renewable sources have proven to be expensive. Nonetheless, car manufacturers are banking on hydrogen ultimately becoming a major source of fuel in the future, and Honda especially is keen to stay at the front of the game. ‘Honda has led the industry for nearly two decades in the development and deployment of fuel-cell technology through extensive real-world testing, including the first government fleet deployment and retail customer leasing program,’ the company said in a statement. ‘Since the introduction of its first generation fuel-cell vehicle, the FCX, in 2002, Honda has made significant technological advancements in fuel-cell vehicle operation in both hot and sub-freezing weather while meeting customer expectations and safety regulations.’","Japanese company Honda has unveiled its new FCV concept car .

"The fiance of a woman could only watch as she fell to her death off a 25-metre cliff during a camping trip south-west of Sydney. Campbelltown couple Paul Veitch and Megan Moody were at the popular swimming hole, Mermaid Pools near Tahmoor, when the 38-year-old plunged to her death on Tuesday night. They had been engaged for two months when Ms Moody slipped while collecting water with a billy can about 8.30pm while her fiance was only just steps behind her, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Campbelltown couple Paul Veitch and Megan Moody were at the popular swimming hole, Mermaid Pools near Tahmoor, when the 38-year-old plunged to her death on Tuesday night . Mr Veitch, 36, tried to revive her after he made his way down the cliff to the isolated spot and found his fiancee's unconscious body. When she was unresponsive, he made his way back to their campsite and called for emergency services. Police told Fairfax Media Ms Moody's death appeared to be an accident but they were still investigating the matter. '[There were] no arguments before. Actually they were out there having a good time and camping overnight,' Camden police Inspector Jayne Doherty said. They had been engaged for two months when Ms Moody slipped while collecting water with a billy can about 8.30pm while her fiance was only just steps behind her . On September 4, Mr Veitch announced his engagement to 'Meg' on Facebook after being together for just six months and said she had made him 'real happy'. 'I lashed out and offered to marry her,' he wrote. 'Geez it felt good when i got told to bugger off nar jokes the ring fit an she said yes woohoo my meg rules hah anutha 9 day in paradise party on (sic).' Three days later after the engagement, Mr Veitch - who listed his occupation as a prawn trawler -posted a selfie of him and Ms Moody smiling at 'a cool little pad up the mountains'. The couple had been planning on spending the night at Mermaid Pools with police warning people to be careful when camping near cliffs. 'Just a general warning to people who are attending these sort of areas of a night time - particularly if people are intoxicated,' Inspector Michael Bright told ABC Radio. 'There's no lighting, it's quite a high area - there's a lot of cliff face around it and there's also no mobile service so if something goes wrong it's an area where you're not going to get a quick response from emergency services.' Police will prepare a report for the coroner.","Peter Veitch and Megan Moody were camping south-west of Sydney .

"This unfortunate mug shot belongs to Gabriel Harris, a 33-year-old blue-haired man who was arrested at a Taco Bell restaurant in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, just after 3 a.m. on Sunday. According to his arrest report, Harris  got into an altercation at the drive-through after staff refused to take his order because he wasn’t in a car. Harris and a woman, named as Sarah Haliburton, then entered the restaurant but were again refused because it was after 3 a.m. and the restaurant had closed. Gabriel Harris, 33, got into an altercation at the drive-through after staff refused to take his order because he wasn't in a vehicle, according to his arrest report . When Harris refused to leave because he had already placed an order, employees called the cops. An employee told Aron Tobler told police that he refused service to Harris and Haliburton because 'they placed an order on bicycles.' Police found Harris on a bicycle by the menu speaker, reports The Daytona Beach News-Journal. When police arrived they asked Harris to leave, but then spotted a red Swiss Army knife on his belt loop and tried to reach for it. Harris then grabbed the officer's wrist and was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed. Police say he suffered a scraped forehead as a result of the scuffle. Harris was arrested at this Taco Bell restaurant in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, just after 3 a.m. on Sunday . Harris was booked into jail and charged with resisting arrest with violence. He was later released on $1,000 bond. Haliburton was not charged. Sunday's incident is Harris’ second arrest in the past four months. He was arrested for resisting an officer without violence in early August, reports the Miami Herald.","Gabriel Harris, 33, got into an altercation at the Taco Bell drive-through in Florida .

"A Colorado CrossFit athlete was performing a routine lift during a competition in Southern California over the weekend when he suffered a critical injury to his spine, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Tragedy struck Sunday while Kevin Ogar, a coach at a CrossFit gym in Denver, was performing a 'snatch' - a staple move in the sport that combines weightlifting, gymnastics and sprinting. According to published reports, the 6 foot 1, 210-pound Ogar lifted a heavy barbell to his waist  and then over his head, but couldn't hold it, letting the heavy bar plummet to the floor behind him. Scroll down for video . Modern-day gladiator: CrossFit athlete Kevin Ogar, pictured here lifting 275lbs, was left paralyzed from the waist down while competing in California . Fateful moment: Ogar (center) is shown lifting hundreds of pounds of weight in Costa Mesa Sunday . 'Freak accident': These images show Ogar trying to lift the bar from the waist over his head, only to have it plummet to the ground behind him . Terrible injury: The bar carrying the weights bounced and struck Ogar in the back, severing his spine and leaving him unable to move his legs . The bar bounced against another set of weights, striking Ogar in the back and severing his spine. ‘When impact was made, he jumped almost like someone shot him,’ Ogar's friend and employer Matt Hathcock told ABC News. The gravely injured athlete collapsed to the floor inside the Costa Mesa venue hosting the OC Throwdown, unable to move his legs. The CrossFit enthusiast and his training partners described the devastating injury as a 'freak accident' and insisted that the flourishing sport was not to blame for it. However, the increasingly popular high-intensity physical regimen has been criticized in recent years by members of the medical community, who have expressed concerns over potential risks to the athletes’ health. Dr. Vonda Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, told ABC News she has seen a spike in the number of CrossFit-related injuries supposedly caused by lack of supervision, bad form and excessive training. Brave face: This photo of Kevin was posted on Facebook with a message that said he had slept for 5 hours and brushed his own teeth. He has returned to CrossFit following his crippling injury, posting videos of himself completing the same lift that severed his spine . Bad move: Ogar, a CrossFit coach from Denver, . was performing an Olympic lift when the barbell fell, bounced against . another set of weights and struck him in the back, severing his spine . Great expectations: Ogar (far left) has been training for years in hopes of qualifying for the annual CrossFit Games competition . ‘Kevin has been doing CrossFit for a very long time at a very high level. Are injuries going to occur? Sure, but Kevin's not going to blame the sport,’ Hathcock told ABC. ‘This was not the fault of CrossFit.’ Since it was founded by California fitness coach Greg Glassman in 2000, CrossFit's popularity has exploded in the U.S., with nearly 7,000 privately owned gyms dedicated to the hard-core fitness program. Every year, Glassman's company, CrossFit Inc, holds CrossFit Games where first-place winners can walk away with as much as $275,000 in prize money and land lucrative sponsorship deals. As a top-tier athlete, Ogar has been training to compete in the televised Games in the near future. Now, he is fighting to regain the use of his legs. The Missouri native works part time at a Whole Food supermarket and had no health insurance to cover his mounting medical bills. Hard-core fitness: CrossFit refers to a high-intensity fitness regimen first introduced in 2000 that combines several athletic disciplines . Let's get physical: CrossFit athletes train in weightlifting, gymnastics and sprinting . To help Ogar with his recovery, the global CrossFit community has rallied around him, raising money towards his costly medical treatment and rehabilitation. As of Thursday evening, 3,230 people from all over the world have donated just under $200,000 on Fundly.com. His friends and supporters also have been selling T-shirts on the site KevinOgar to help the injured athlete financially. Ogar has undergone two surgeries so far, had screws and rods inserted in his injured back, and will be moved to a rehab facility in Colorado. Vince Ogar, Kevin’s father, told the station KSDK his son already had his first physical therapy session and was fitted with a back brace, adding that his spirit remains unbroken. The family hope the resilient athlete will walk again.","Denver CrossFit coach Kevin Ogar was competing in OC Throwdown when the accident happened .

"People cope with the death of a loved one in different ways. And one US cremation service thinks an urn that is the spitting image of a loved one’s head might help mourners with their loss by commemorating a friend or family member. The company offers 3D printed urns the same size as a person’s head with realistic details, and even lets people put a family member’s face on a miniature model of a super hero, if they so desire. A US cremation service enables mourners to create a life-like bust of a loved one that functions as an urn. It uses 3D printing to transform a photo into the 3D sculpture. An urn in the image of President Obama is shown . The company in Arlington, Vermont, writes on its website: ‘With personal urns, you can have a lifelike bust of your loved one that doubles as an urn for the ashes.’ To demonstrate its skills, the firm has created a President Obama urn and says that it can even make wigs for the functional busts to create a more life-like effigy of people with long hair. ‘Shorter hair can be made as part of the urn itself. A solid brass nameplate is available,’ it says. The company offers 3D printed urns the same size as a person’s head, with realistic details such as eye colour and stubble (shown). It also makes wigs for them, to depict longer hair realistically . A service from My3D Twin offers people the chance to create a 3D printed model of themselves. The models range in height from 5cm to 25cm and use a combination of 3D scanning and printing technology to capture an individual's features. Intricate details from clothes and jewellery to facial expression and even the exact shade of lipstick can be transferred to a custom-made 'high-level composite' plastic model. To create the models, individuals are photographed by 50 cameras from every angle in a London studio, and data is extracted to create a 3D computer model. The model itself is printed with a state-of-the-art full-colour 3D printer that can create an incredible 390,000 colours to ensure that the mini-me is as lifelike as possible. They cost between £84 and £192 and are ready 24 hours after the scanning process. Cremation Solutions uses facial recognition software to turn two dimensional photographs of people into 3D sculptures. The software extracts the properties of a person, such as the position of their eyes and shape of their nose, to create a 3D computer model. The data is then used by a machine to print out the bust, by layering up tiny ceramic particles and colouring them one of thousands of colours to ensure the bust is as life like as possible. The firm boasts that it can ‘even erase blemishes so they (a loved one) will look their best for all eternity’. ‘You will never again have to worry that you might forget what your loved one looked like when you invest in one of these custom made very lifelike cremation urns,’ it says. Ashes are poured into the urn through a plug on the bottom and the urns have a heavy marble base to prevent them from toppling over and ashes spilling out. The company says: ‘One benefit to these personalised urns is that there will never be a doubt about what they are. 'With a regular urn, you are undoubtedly asked questions about what it's for, and that leads to a conversation about the deceased. ‘Perfectly matching the image of your loved one, people will just assume that you had a bust made to remember them.’ The full-sized personal urns cost $2,600 (£1,657) with a keepsake sized equivalent costing $600 (£382) and take less than two weeks to make.

"He's about to become a grandfather for the second time but Prince Charles has admitted that he does have a preference where the sex of the new baby is concerned. Speaking at an event in south-east London yesterday, he told well-wishers that he and the Duchess of Cornwall would love to have a granddaughter. Congratulated by entrepreneur Corey Johnson on becoming a grandfather, the heir to the throne replied: 'I am already. But it's wonderful to be a . grandfather again. I'm looking forward to it - but I hope it will be a . girl this time.' Scroll down for video . All smiles: A delighted Prince Charles said he and Camilla were 'thrilled' at news of a second royal baby . Charles isn't the only royal to state a preference for a girl, with Prince Harry also revealing that he'd like a niece - if only for the chaos she would bring to his brother's life. At an Invictus Games event on Tuesday, the prince joked that he would love to see William 'cope with that' should the new baby prove to be a girl. Whether it's a boy or girl, Charles was happy to describe the news as 'splendid' as he was quizzed by well-wishers during an event in Bermondsey which saw him meet young entrepreneurs supported by the Prince's Trust. He was questioned by the family of entrepreneur Demi Owoseje, who had opened up her leather upholstery studio for a royal visit. Excited: The prince told of his joy during a meeting with young entrepreneurs in south-east London . Enjoying the day: Charles couldn't resist talking about his new grandchild despite warnings from the Palace . Although . Charles appeared to enjoy being shown around the studio, when Ms . Owoseje's sister Toyin, 26, and mother Elizabeth, 50, were introduced, . there was only one subject on their mind - Kate's pregnancy. Toyin . congratulated Charles first, with the royal skittishly replying: 'What . did I do?', before adding: 'It hasn't arrived yet - (but) splendid, . we're very excited.' 'I . asked him how he felt about becoming a grandfather for a second time . and he asked me if I had any grandchildren,' said Mrs Owoseje following her encounter with Prince Charles. 'Not . yet, my daughter's too busy with her business.He said the baby was part . of life's experiences and he seemed quite happy about it.' The . Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were forced to announce the news several . weeks early, after Kate began suffering from the same severe morning . sickness that blighted her first pregnancy. Betting began on the sex of the new child within minutes of the announcement, with a girl the favourite according to bookmakers Coral. Popular names for a new princess include Elizabeth, Alexandra, Victoria and Charlotte. Less popular choices include Eleanor and Florence. Fascinating stuff: During the visit, Prince Charles heard from budding entrepreneurs supported by his charity . Good stuff: The prince was meeting young entrepreneurs supported by The Prince's Trust today . Pro: Prince Charles has plenty of experience and spent time with Camilla's grandchildren over the summer . She might be in the early stages of her second pregnancy but it seems the Duchess of Cambridge has no intention of stopping there. According to friends, she wants three children by the age of 35, which is why this second baby comes so soon after the birth of 13-month-old Prince George. Although the Duke of Cambridge has often said he would be happy with a family of two, the Duchess is one of a trio of children and, aged 33 when baby number two arrives, will have plenty of time to complete her family on schedule. The claims, which were made in the Telegraph newspaper, come just a day after the second royal pregnancy was announced by Kensington Palace. Once again suffering from debilitating morning sickness, the pregnancy news has thrown her attendance at this week's Invictus Games and next week's visit to Malta into doubt. Kensington Palace say a decision is yet to be taken. Ruth Styles .","Prince Charles told well-wishers he was 'thrilled' by baby news .

"At some point during our journey, it occurs to me that holidaying with two boys under two, a husband who will have to abandon us after a couple of days for a business meeting, a sleep-deprived couple with a 12-week-old baby and one bouncy bachelor is not wise. Rome airport does not help. It is dirty, cramped and hot. The car hire area is awash with irate parents, screaming children and lashings of eau d’armpit. Then an accidental circuit of the entire Rome ring road does not add to our general joie de vivre. On Rome's doorstep - but you'd never know: Lazio boasts hilltop citadels such as the lovely Poggio Bustone . But if anything can soothe frazzled nerves, it is the sweeping lawns, cool interiors and extraordinary calm of Villa La Scorticata. Villa specialist CV Travel has some splendid properties on its books. But this one - an 18th-century farmhouse in Lazio - is glorious. It’s awash with pale greens, creams and soft yellows. None of these are colours you would ever think of putting together - and yet they are so pleasing to the eye, we all want to rush home and start redecorating. Outside, we find lawns, roses, fig trees drooping with fat weeping fruit, a discreet swimming pool. All of it is utterly and splendidly isolated, in a clearing on top of a hill, up a long rutted track and through a 250-hectare forest (a bit Blair Witch Project at night). The owners have even left us firm instructions to shut the gate, to keep the wild boar out of the swimming pool. Lazio, bordering Tuscany and Umbria in the north and Campania in the south, isn’t a trendy part of Italy. Sting doesn’t have a villa here. Not a bad spot to while away a week: Jane stayed at the splendid Villa La Scorticata . What you do see is real Italians hanging out their washing, drinking amazingly good cappuccinos outside petrol stations, doing their weekly shop and commuting to work in the medieval city of Viterbo. Possibly even popping to the thermal springs at Terme dei Papi for a dip on the way home. There’s much to do, too; a relief, because a baby-heavy week in a villa needs breaking up with the odd outing to prevent cabin fever. Toddler time: The villa was a great base for a holiday with Jane's two sons (both under two) For one member of our party, a daily trip to the spectacular cheese counter at the supermarket in Cura di Vetralla is enough to keep him happy. Never has one man bought and consumed so much burrata — a delicious combination of mozzarella and cream that means ‘buttery’ in Italian. By his third visit, the manager is rushing out to greet him, and buyers are dispatched far and wide to find richer, creamier burratas. For those who are more cultural-minded, Rome is an easy possibility, just 60 miles away. But if, like us, you can’t face the ring road again - even for a glimpse of Pope Francis and a quick pizza - then the fortified hilltop town of Tarquinia is a great alternative. Only 30 miles away, and a hop and a skip from beaches and endless gelaterias, it’s also reputedly Italy’s oldest city, founded by the Estruscans in the 12th-century BC. It is largely unspoilt by tourism, and boasts the most magnificent necropolis imaginable. Here, more than 6,000 graves are cut into the limestone, at least 200 of them painted with jaunty scenes — supposedly to make the dead feel at home when, as was firmly believed, they awoke in the afterlife. Vast banquets, naked servants, sexually explicit acts and extraordinary revelry - they give more than a taste of the Estruscans’ brilliantly naughty lifestyle. In contrast, our own revelries at Villa La Scorticata seem a little tame - though I doubt even the Estruscans could have challenged us over the consumption of burrata mozzarella.

"A 93-year-old died after being scalded when care home staff used boiling water  to treat her constipation, an inquest heard. Freda Owens suffered horrific burns after a carer at The Croft House Rest Home in Freckleton, Lancashire sat her on a commode of boiling water from a kettle thinking it would help her condition. The painful injuries on her backside had forced her to lie on her side - and this caused a deep tissue pressure sore close to her left hip bone to worsen. Freda Owens (pictured left with daughter Susan Tate) died after being scalded when care home staff used boiling water from a kettle to treat her constipation, a coroner ruled . Coroner Alan Wilson heard that this wound was then not spotted by a district nurse, who examined Mrs Owens after the incident on November 2, 2012. As the great grandmother's condition deteriorated she was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital on November 23. But the sore continued to go unnoticed until Christmas Eve - nearly two months after the incident. She died just over a week later at the hospital on January 3, 2013. Mr Wilson concluded that two factors contributed to Mrs Owens' death - the burns she suffered as a result of the commode and the delay in treatment this caused for her pressure sore. He said staff had failed to spot the sore because her burns were so severe she found it painful when moved. Speaking after the inquest in Blackpool, Lancashire, Mrs Owens' family slammed the 'shocking standard of care' she received. They said: 'The death of Freda was not just avoidable or preventable but needless and unnecessary. 'There can be no doubt that the sub-optimum care, together with the scald incident itself, resulted in unnecessary, needless and prolonged suffering. 'The verdict has been a long time coming but unfortunately it has all been too little, too late. Mrs Owens suffered horrific burns after a carer at The Croft House Rest Home (pictured) in Freckleton, Lancashire asked her to sit on a commode of boiling water . 'Freda has died. Nothing can bring her back or undo the harm she suffered. 'It is with regret that the ripple effects of this has far reaching consequences and the pain and suffering continues for those that Freda left behind.' Her daughter Susan Tate, 69, and granddaughter Kerry Esgate, 39, said Mrs Owens, a great-grandmother-of-four, had been living independently but suffered a fall three years ago. They said she never returned home after injuring her wrist and was placed straight into the care home by the hospital. Micaila Williams, representing the family, told the court that Mrs Owens developed a pressure sore in October 2012, which 'wasn't managed properly'. Referring to the burns she suffered from the commode, she said: 'No practice was in place to allow that procedure to take place. 'It was inherently risky and dangerous and the water wasn't tested and the pressure sore was under-assessed by district nurses. 'Due to the burns, she was unable to move properly and risk of further pressure sores heightened. 'The district nurse wasn't made aware and there was a lack of communication that clearly led to difficulties moving forward.' Mr Wilson said: 'Freda was placed in a commode in her room at her care home in the hope steam would ease constipation. The coroner concluded that two factors contributed to Mrs Owens' death - the burns she suffered as a result of the commode and the delay in treatment this caused for her pressure sore . 'This unintentionally resulted in burns and scalds. 'On November 21, she was examined but that didn't include assessment of her left hip area and she deteriorated. 'On November 23, she was hospitalised and it was not until December 24 that the injury to her left hip was recognised as a pressure sore. 'There was a delay in treatment which could have affected the outcome. 'I don't find failings at the care home as a whole, aside from the action of the individual carer who utilised the commode.' Mr Wilson returned a narrative verdict and accepted evidence given by Dr Alison Armer, a pathologist at the Royal Preston Hospital, who reported the cause of death as being bronchial pneumonia due to necrotic, chronic pressure ulcer to the left hip and burns or scalds to the buttock. A pre-inquest hearing earlier this year revealed police had spoken to the carer, who poured boiling water into the commode, and the Crown Prosecution Service about the incident at the the care home. But it was decided the care worker should not be prosecuted. A member of staff at the care home said the manager was not available for comment this evening.","Freda Owen suffered horrific burns after sitting on commode of boiling water .

"Surgeon Argiris Asderakis told an inquest he alone made the decision to use infected kidneys for transplants which killed two fathers . A surgeon told today how he alone made the decision to use infected kidneys from a rough-sleeping alcoholic with meningitis for transplants which killed two fathers. Consultant Argiris Asderakis decided on his own judgement to accept the deadly kidneys - despite knowing they had been rejected by other hospitals across Britain due to the donor's background - and that the cause of the donor's death was a mystery. Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42, and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were kept in the dark by doctors at a Welsh NHS hospital about the lifestyle of their donor. Consultant surgeon Mr Asderakis, 51, admitted he took a calculated risk in accepting the kidneys of the 39-year-old alcoholic who died from meningitis. The inquest heard Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart died within three weeks of being given the kidneys infected with a parasitic worm. Experienced transplant surgeon Mr Asderakis told their inquest there was no way he could have known the kidneys were infected with the extremely rare worm - and led to the first recorded human to human transmission in history. He said: 'I found out after their deaths. I cannot say what I felt when I discovered there was an infection. 'Not just me, but the whole unit are distraught about that and we are trying to learn lessons. Nobody could have predicted it.' Mr Asderakis, a transplant surgeon for 14 years at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, said not knowing the exact cause of death of a transplant donor was 'not uncommon'. The inquest heard that in the last 10 years there have been 159 transplants carried out with the organs of someone who died from meningitis or encephalitis of an unknown cause. Mr Asderakis said: 'Other surgeons in similar circumstance have taken the same decision on the balance of risk and the outcomes for these are at least as good as patients who don't come under theses risks [of accepting organs where a cause of death is unknown]. 'Many patients in the country have benefited from donors like that. The decision to transplant is always a risk - it is never clear cut.' Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42(left), and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67 (right), were kept in the dark by doctors at a Welsh NHS hospital about the lifestyle of their donor, an inquest heard . The family of Robert 'Jim' Stuart arriving at the inquest. Mr Asderakis today said he decided the risk was low of the brain infection being transmitted during the transplant . Mr Asderakis said he decided the risk was low of the brain infection being transmitted during the transplant. He told the inquest he had explained the small risk of brain infection to Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart before getting their consent for the transplant operation to go ahead. When he said this the families of both men shook their heads. Mr Asderakis said transplant operations using 'high risk' organs occur every day across the country and it was impossible to eliminate risk. He said: 'If you exclude all high risk donors then we will stop 11 per cent of donors in this country - that is 1,500 transplants.' Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart were both on the donor waiting list and were telephoned in the early hours of November 30 last year and told they had found a 'good match' and would receive a transplant. The transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff . But the kidneys from the donor in the Manchester area - who was known to have slept rough and drank 11 times the weekly recommended alcohol level - had been rejected by hospitals from Edinburgh to Birmingham. The two NHS patients both died within weeks of undergoing their kidney transplants from the same parasitic worm that had infected the donor. Doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as Halicephalobus which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out. The parasite lays eggs in the liver and kidneys and then travels to the brain where it stops the blood supply and causes bleeding. The inquest in Cardiff has now been adjourned until December.","Robert Stuart and Darren Hughes both died after having transplant surgery .

"A mosque has been under attack for the second time in less than a week after a pig's head was discovered at the site. Worshippers found the head in the mosque's courtyard in Wallsend in Newcastle's western suburbs of New South Wales shortly before midday on Wednesday. The incident has been caught on CCTV and police are currently investigating the attack. A mosque has been under attack for the second time in less than a week after a pig's head was discovered at the site (stock image) 'It's a sad incident,' Newcastle Muslim Association spokeswoman Diana Rah told AAP. 'It's not so much the action itself, but it's the intention and hate behind it. 'We've got a lot of support from the wider community, so it's a shame that there are elements in the community who commit these sorts of crimes.' The incident follows just days after a Muslim man was punched in the face and racially taunted outside the mosque as he left a prayer last Wednesday. The incident has been caught on CCTV and police are currently investigating the attack (stock image) But Ms Rah said she wasn't sure if the two attacks were linked. 'In the last couple of months there has been a heightened level of verbal abuse, especially with women in the community being targeted because they're easily identifiable wearing hijabs,' she said. 'But that had started to die down and we thought we'd hopefully seen the end of it. 'But the incident last week, and this incident again this week, has probably put a bit of fear into our community.' Newcastle Superintendent John Gralton would not comment on the motivation behind the attack and has appealed for information from the public.

"Green-fingered: Prince Charles has allowed the clippings from yew hedges at his Highgrove Estate to be turned into cancer-fighting drugs . He is well known for his love of homeopathy and natural health cures. Now Prince Charles is allowing the clippings from yew hedges in his beloved gardens at Highgrove to be turned into cancer-fighting drugs. This year 820lbs of cuttings from the common European yews that line large parts of his Gloucestershire estate are being turned into treatments for breast, ovarian, lung and Aids-related cancers. The innovative scheme is the brainchild of a small Chichester-based company, Limehurst, which has been harvesting hedge clippings for use in cancer treatments for more than 20 years. Over 4,000 public and private gardens take part in the scheme – and now Highgrove has been added to the list, with some cuttings made by the gardening prince’s own fair hand. According to one royal aide, the prince loves order and structure in his gardens and has planted dozens of yews in the world-famous grounds of his private country home, particularly in the Sundial and Cottage Garden areas. Many of these have been made in topiaries, leading to a lot of waste which is normally made into compost. This year, however, Charles has given permission for the clippings from the hedges to be used in the treatment of cancer. Certain species of yews – including those at Highgrove - contain cancer fighting molecules known as taxanes in the tips of their branches. These molecules work as what is known as an ‘anti-mitotic’ and prevents cells from multiplying, halting the growth of those infected with cancer. They also effectively prevent blood vessels supporting cancer cell growth. The clippings can only be harvested at a certain time each year – from June to September – when yews are producing their new year growth. This year 820lbs of cuttings from the common European yews that line large parts of his estate in Doughton, Gloucestershire, are being used for cancer drugs . Outside of this period, the vital chemical extracts found within yew hedges are significantly reduced as the stems become too ‘woody’. Once collected, the clippings are stabilised through drying at the Limehurt’s barn in West Sussex before being sent to Europe, where they are ground by drugs companies into powder and extraction of the compound takes place. A ‘carrier fluid’ is used to dilute the dosage to enable intravenous delivery for cancer patients. The molecules are incorporated into a number of well-known drugs used to treat both NHS patients and sufferers around the world. As yew hedge clippings are not easily compostable, contain toxins and are not environmentally friendly to burn, the ‘recycling’ of them into anti-cancer drugs is also considered an eco-friendly method to make use of an otherwise unpleasant garden waste. Limehurst, the company used by the heir to throne, pays for the clippings and Charles has donated the ‘few hundred pounds’ he has received from them to a local hospice, sources confirmed. Since it started the initiative, the firm has recycled 5,500 tonnes of yew clippings. It also donates unwanted fees to the cancer charity CLIC Sargent. A Clarence House spokesman told the Mail this week: ‘Using the yew hedge clippings is something we have done in the past and, after a break, we are starting to do it again. ‘The clipping are bought from the estate and the Prince of Wales has donated the money he has received to a local hospice. It is clearly a very worthwhile initiative.’ Britain’s oldest tree, an ancient pagan symbol of life and longevity, has long been known for its ‘life-saving’ properties. Yew is from the Taxaceae family and it’s botanical name taxus baccata. It is reasonably hardy and grows on any soil, although it prefers chalk and limestone. Yew was the preferred wood for making medieval longbows because of its flexibility. It was also one of the seven sacred trees in Celtic tradition and was used by the Druids for prophecy. It is widely believed that early Christians adopted ancient sacred sites for their churches, hence the proliferation of yew trees in churchyards. Its toxic properties were also believed to ward off sheep from the graveyards. In Japan it has been used to treat diabetes and induce abortions. Native Indians in the USA also used a yew brew to treat rheumatism, fever and arthritis. Now these molecules are being harvested by modern scientists in the fight against breast and ovarian cancer, with generally excellent results.","Cuttings from Prince Charles's yew hedges are used for cancer drugs .

"Scroll down for video . The days of carrying bottles of suncream to the beach could be over, as the world's first drinkable SPF is launched. Harmonised H20 UV claims to provide holidaymakers with up to factor 30 protection, meaning sunbathers could be able to soak up the rays for longer without fear of getting burned. Once ingested, the product's liquid molecules vibrate on the skin, cancelling out 97 per cent of UVA and UVB rays, according to US company Osmosis Skincare. Increased protection: The new liquid could mean sunbathers could soak up the rays for longer . Drinkable sun cream: The two liquids - tanning and non-tanning - are on sale costing £17 . The liquid sunscreen - which claims to be the world's first - is on sale now, costing £17 for a 100ml bottle. There are two varieties available - 'tanning' and 'non tanning', the former allows users achieve a tan while being protected from harmful sun rays, the company states. However, the US company does admit that none of its claims have been approved by the Federal Drugs Agency. On its website, the medical skincare brand advises: 'Take 2ml every 4 hours while in the sun (preferably with 2+ oz of water). 'Wait 1 hour before exposure to the sun. Monitor sun exposure carefully. 'Take second dose if still in sun 3 hours after first dose. 'For extended intense exercise outdoors or if taking sun-sensitizing medications, use alternate protection after 30-40 minutes.' Dr Ben . Johnson, who founded the company, adds in his blog: 'If 2 mls are . ingested an hour before sun exposure, the frequencies that have been . imprinted on water will vibrate on your skin in such a way as to cancel . approximately 97% of the UVA and UVB rays before they even hit your . skin. 'This results in coverage for approximately three hours. 'This is similar to the amount of UV . reflection created by SPF 30 titanium/zinc sunblocks but distinctly . better than UVB chemical sunscreens which prevent certain damage that . leads to the visible/painful/inflammation reaction we identify as sun . damage.' Harmonised H20 is yet to be endorsed by . dermatologist bodies, however, the company website does carry . testimonials for the product. The end for lotion? The new drinkable liquid offers up to factor 30 protection . One, submitted via Facebook, said: 'I tested the UV Protection Harmonized Water (my skin burns in 15 minutes w/o sunscreen so i was nervous) SUCCESS!! I was outside for 2 hours with NO sunscreen during peak hours and wasn't even pink! 'My year and a half year old drinks it as well and hasn't burned once this summer and is outside everyday! Thank You, Thank You for this product!' Hermoine Lawson, spokesman at the British Skin Foundation, said: 'We would advise extreme caution of any product claiming UV protection using methods not supported by clinical research. 'When it comes to an issue as serious as preventing skin cancer, customer testimonials cannot take the place of scientific evidence, for which this particular product cannot provide. 'Children's skin is particularly sensitive and therefore more prone to damage from UV rays, so it is even more important to stick to the tried and tested methods of sun protection when it comes to protecting their skin.'","Harmonised H20 UV claims to offer wearers factor 30 protection .

"Buckingham Palace staff have sparked internal security fears by bringing casual partners met over dating apps back to their living quarters. Police guarding the royal residences are said to be ‘deeply concerned’ at the number of unvetted overnight guests, many of whom appear to be casual acquaintances met online. Apps such as Tinder and Grindr allow smartphone users to find potential love matches nearby using GPS locators. According to well-placed sources, a number of the Queen's 800-plus staff are said to be using online dating apps . They have proved phenomenally popular and have millions of users around the world – however they have also been criticised for promoting casual sex. And according to well-placed sources, a number of the Queen’s 800-plus staff are said to use such online dating tools. While most live-in servants –including butlers, maids and kitchen staff – are not allowed to bring guests into Buckingham Palace itself, they are permitted to sign in visitors to their living quarters at St James’s Palace and the Royal Mews. This situation is not new, but the rise of dating apps has sparked concerns among the Metropolitan Police that servants are bringing back guests whom they know nothing about. The source said: ‘There are real and serious security concerns at Buckingham Palace about members of staff use of dating apps such as Tinder, which can be rather sleazy. ‘The palace police are particularly unhappy about the number of guests of servants staying overnight, especially when they may have only just met on Tinder. Police guarding the royal residences, such as Buckingham Palace, pictured, are said to be ‘deeply concerned’ at the number of unvetted overnight guests . They know nothing of the guests’ background and say they could be anyone. ‘It is a security nightmare, especially in the current climate. The guests are allowed to stay at St James’s Palace but some have complained that when they leave they get asked “a million questions” by officers. But police say they are only doing their job.’ One former head of royal protection, Chief Superintendent Dai Davies, said yesterday that the problem of overnight guests in palace accommodation was the ‘Achilles heel’ of royal security. He said: ‘Historically this has always been a problem, even when I was in charge way before the introduction of these so-called dating apps. ‘If members of staff lived in certain quarters such as the Royal Mews and Kensington Palace, which have both single sex and married quarters, they were, and I presume still are, permitted to bring back unvetted guests. ‘Often these guests were total strangers. It makes a complete mockery of the security structure, unfortunately.’ The Palace are said to be concerned with staff bringing back people they have met on Tinder, a dating app, which allow smartphone users to find potential love matches using GPS . Mr Davies was appointed as unit commander in charge of royal protection for the Queen and her family in 1995, and was responsible for both palace and personal protection. ‘It was something that greatly concerned me at the time and I suspect is still an Achilles heel,’ he added. ‘I am sure it will be of concern to the director of security, particularly given that we are still operating at the second highest level of threat to the country.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment, saying they never discussed security matters. One official explained, however, that there was a ‘clear internal policy, advising staff as to rules on guest access’. The aide also rejected the suggestion that an internal link had been made between the use of such dating apps and any specific risk to security.","Palace staff have sparked internal security fears over staff using dating apps .

"Gone are the days of flight attendants in miniskirts, but sexism in still alive and well in the the airline industry - as evidenced by a note a passenger left to his female pilot on a flight this weekend in Canada. WestJet Airlines pilot Carey Steacy had just wrapped up a flight from Victoria to Calgary when cleaning crews brought her a note, written on a napkin, left behind by one of the passengers. The note, written by a 'David' and left at seat 12 E, tells Steacy that 'the cockpit of an airliner is no place for a woman. A woman's place: A passenger named 'David' left behind this sexist note aimed at female WestJet Airlines pilot Carey Steacy after a flight this weekend in Canada . Sexist: In the note, David said that a woman's greatest honor is being a mother and that they are short moms and not pilots . 'A woman being a mother is the most honor, not as ""captain"". We're short mothers, not pilots WestJet,' the note continues. 'PS I wish WestJet could tell me a fair lady is at the helm so I could book another flight! In the end this is all mere vanity. Not impressed.' The note is signed 'Respectfully in love, David'. Steacy, a mother of two, told CTV News that she is used to passengers being surprised that they have a female captain, but she has never been the target of such blatant sexism. Her male co-pilot and the female flight attendants were equally shocked by the message. 'We didn't know what to say,' she said. Not OK: Mother of two, and a pilot for 17 years, Steacy shot back at the sexist passenger by posting pictures of the note on her Facebook . But eventually Steacy decided to make a stand, and posted the pictures of the note on Facebook to make a point that what the passenger wrote was not OK. 'I have heard many comments from people throughout my 17-year career as a pilot. Most of them positive. Your note is, without a doubt, the funniest. It was a joke, right? RIGHT?? I thought, not. 'You were more than welcome to deplane when you heard I was a ""fair lady"". You have that right. Funny, we all, us humans, have the same rights in this great free country of ours.' The airline also issued a statement, saying: 'We are enormously proud of the professionalism, skills and expertise of our pilots and we were disappointed to see this note.' Biggest hope: Steacy says she hopes the incident will inspire more women to enroll in flight schools to become pilots . Spokesman Robert Palmer wouldn't speak further, saying 'to do so only serves to lend credibility to the note, which it doesn't deserve.' Since posting the pictures on Facebook, Steacy says she's received an overwhelming amount of supportive comments. 'I have to think that’s very much an uncommon opinion among the general public,' she said. She hopes some good will come of the incident, and inspire more women to enroll in flight schools to become pilots themselves. 'I just hope that that mindset can change, like it has in a lot of professions,' she said.","WestJet Airlines pilot Carey Steacy found the sexist note after finishing a weekend flight from Calgary to Victoria .

"The smell of a baby excites a woman in the same way an addict craving for drugs enjoys his fix, say scientists. A newborn's odour is a chemical communication between mother and child and sparks the same reward circuits in the brain as when eating something nice - or having sex. Researchers say when a woman feels like 'gobbling up' a baby placed in her arms - even if it's not hers - it's a natural biological reaction linked to maternal functions. The smell of a baby excites a woman in the same way an addict craving for drugs enjoys his fix, say scientists. When a woman feels like 'gobbling up' a baby placed in her arms - even if it's not hers - it's a natural biological reaction linked to maternal functions . Dr Johannes Frasnelli, of Montreal University, said: 'The olfactory - thus non-verbal and non-visual - chemical signals for communication between mother and child are intense. 'What we've shown for the first time is the odour of newborns - which is part of these signals - activates the neurological reward circuit in mothers. Canadian researchers found the odour of newborns activates the neurological reward circuit in mothers . 'These circuits may especially be . activated when you eat while being very hungry, but also in a craving . addict receiving his drug. It is in fact the sating of desire.' Dr . Frasnelli and colleagues presented two groups of 15 women - one that . had given birth within six weeks and the other who had never had babies - . with the pyjama scents of newborns while scanning their brains. Although the babies were not their own the pleasure chemical dopamine shot up on the images of the mothers in the caudate nucleus compared to the non-mothers, says the study published in Frontiers in Psychology. The caudate nucleus is in the centre of the brain and plays a role in reward learning. Dr Frasnelli said: 'And dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter in the neural reward circuit.' This system reinforces the motivation to act in a certain way because of the pleasure associated with a given behaviour. Dr Frasnelli said: 'This circuit . makes us desire certain foods and causes addiction to tobacco and other . drugs. Not all odours trigger this reaction. 'Only those associated with reward - such as food or satisfying a desire - cause this activation.' Dopamine is also associated with sexual pleasure and other forms of gratification. The study shows the odour of newborns plays a role in the development of motivational and emotional responses between mother and child by eliciting maternal care functions such as breastfeeding and protection. The mother-child bond that is part of the feeling of maternal love is a product of evolution through natural selection in an environment where such a bond is essential for the newborn's survival. Dr Frasnelli said: 'It's possible childbirth causes hormonal changes that alter the reward circuit in the caudate nucleus - but it's also possible that experience plays a role. It's also not known of this reaction is specific to mothers since men were not part of the experiment.He said: 'What we know now and what is new is there is a neural response linked to the status of biological mother.'","A newborn's odour is a 'chemical communication between mother and child'

"The effects of multiple sclerosis could be relieved by sending electric pulses through a patient's mouth. The tongue is directly connected to the brain stem, and scientists are now investigating how stimulating the muscle could improve the rehabilitation of people with MS. During one experiment, impulses were applied to the patients’ tongues, and over the course of 14 weeks, their balance improved meaning they were able to walk more easily. Electric shocks applied to the tongue (stock image pictured) could help treat the effects of multiple sclerosis (MS), allowing people with the disease to walk more easily . MS is a neurological condition that affects around 100,000 people in the UK. The disease causes the insulation around nerves to become damaged, which disrupts communication between the body and brain, resulting in loss of muscle control. A team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, led by neuroscientist Yuri Danilov, applied the electrical impulses to the tongue as part of physical therapy sessions, for the 14-week duration of the trial, Scientific American reported. They discovered that their patients gained twice as much balance and fluidity of movement compared to people with MS who did the same physical therapy exercises without the new treatment. MS is a neurological condition that affects around 100,000 people in the UK. The disease causes the insulation around nerves to become damaged (illustrated), which disrupts communication between the body and brain, resulting in loss of muscle control . The team is also exploring whether tongue stimulation can be used to treat patients who are losing their sight, have had a stroke or suffer from Parkinson’s. In a previous study, experts enabled a blind woman to see a flickering candle for the first time - via her tongue. Researchers developed a tongue-stimulating system that translated images detected by a camera into a pattern of electric pulses that triggered touch receptors. The woman could perceive the simulation as shapes and features in space, so that the tongue became a surrogate eye. Dr Danilov explained in the Journal of Neuro-Engineering and Rehabilitation that nerves on the tip of the tongue are connected to the brain’s stem, which is a hub responsible for lots of the body’s basic processes. It’s a good place to apply tiny electric shocks because saliva is an electrically conductive fluid, and stimulation can be applied at a much lower voltage than is required for skin. Dr Danilov said: ‘We have probably discovered a new way for the neurorehabilitation of many neurological disorders.’ The team is also exploring whether tongue stimulation can be used to treat patients who are losing their sight, have had a stroke or suffer from Parkinson’s.

"Police on horseback raise levels of public trust and engagement with officers, according to a new study. A report suggests that when deployed on community patrols, officers on horseback appear more visible to the public than those on foot. But, the number of mounted units across the UK has fallen from 17 to 12 in the three years prior to 2013, with some forces closing them in response to Government austerity measures. A report commissioned by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) suggests that when deployed on community patrols, units on horseback (stock image) appear more visible to the public than officers on foot . The report by the University of Oxford and think-tank Rand Europe was commissioned by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). It is based on a study of mounted patrols in areas of Gloucester and south London, which suggested that officers on horseback had six times as many interactions with the public as police on foot. Co-author Ben Bradford, from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Criminology, said: ‘After an initial period of surveying in each of the areas in February 2014, mounted community patrols took place in three of them in March.' A second round of surveying took place in April. ‘Early results reveal a measurable value and impact of mounted police in neighbourhood settings,' continued Mr Bradford. ‘People who have recently seen mounted patrols tend to have higher levels of trust and confidence in police.’ The study also claimed that mounted police have a ‘unique capacity’ when policing disorder, football crowds and public events such as Glastonbury Festival. Here, a police officer on horseback watches over Bayern Munich and Manchester United fans before a football game in April this year . The report said that the 12 mounted police units in the UK - including one for all of Scotland - have 271 officers, 103 staff and 247 horses. This represents a cut of nearly a quarter of national mounted capacity since the beginning of 2012. The study also claimed that mounted police have a ‘unique capacity’ when policing disorder, football crowds and public events such as Glastonbury Festival. Researchers estimate that the cost of keeping mounted units is between £15,500 and £22,000 a year more than the basic cost of employing a regular officer. Gloucestershire Deputy Chief Constable Rod Hansen, the ACPO’s lead for mounted policing, said: ‘It does not feel right to lose such a historic and versatile capability due to short term financial challenges without fully understanding how sadly it would be missed. ‘That doesn’t mean to say there aren’t more cost effective ways of delivering mounted policing, and this academic research will help sign post those alternatives.’ Law enforces in America have used crime-prediction software similar to that seen in the film Minority report, starring Tom Cruise (pictured) When police in the Minority Report film predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it, it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054. But last year, law enforcers in two American states used crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervised them accordingly. Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system used a computer algorithm to decide for them. The Minority Report-style software is already being used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict future murderers. It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes. Professor Berk says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future. It could also be modified to predict lesser crimes.","Report found that units on horseback encourage public engagement .

"Does anyone motor for pleasure any more? They do on the Wild Atlantic Way, which snakes 1,553 miles down Ireland's West Coast from County Donegal to County Cork. Two friends and I flew into Shannon planning to lay siege to some of West Ireland's famous golf courses, including Ballybunion and Lahinch, as well as sample the Wild Atlantic Way (or WAW). A world wonder: The Cliffs of Moher, in County Clare, are an example of Ireland's west coast at its finest . But after settling in at our sinfully comfortable base - Moy House at Lahinch, County Clare, with its sea views, four-poster beds and well-stocked, self-service 'honesty' bar - we decided life was too short to whack dimpled white balls around the countryside with sticks. Plan B was to hire a 'classic car' in which to cruise the Wild Atlantic Way. Here, the first obstacle emerged. The only one available was a 1970 MGB hardtop, with a very small back seat. This would have involved one of us being packed and unpacked into it by Pickfords. So we also rented a back-up Mini diesel at Shannon. Two of us would ride in the MGB at a time. The third would drive shotgun, admiring our progress from the rear. On the road: The Wild Atlantic Way runs along Ireland's west coast for 1,553 spectacular miles . The MGB offered, as you'd expect of a modestly priced, Seventies motor: heavy, unassisted steering; vague, squeaking brakes; a high-minded lack of radio. All features that might have an MGB enthusiast salivating, I concede. Our diesel Mini was licence-threateningly swift, packed with bells and whistles and adored by all. Stephen said he was trading in his Audi A6 for one when we got back. From Lahinch we proceeded, in convoy, to Liscannon and the awesome Cliffs of Moher, and thence to Doolin, with its Irish music bars. We planned to stop for lunch at 300-year-old Linnane's Lobster Bar at New Quay, but couldn't find it on the map. So we stopped at a bar in Ballyvaughan, County Clare, for directions. The sole customer, awoken from his mid-morning reverie, informed us confidently: 'I know it exists all right. I live there.' We had to go right at the church, up the road past the big hay shed and we'd see a sign for Linnane's. Which, eventually, we did and enjoyed a marvellous, fishy lunch. A perfect pitstop: The road meanders through a host of small towns and seafront communities . Along with two pints of Guinness and a glass of Chardonnay. Not each, I should add. Swapping drivers from time to time, our curious convoy motored through the Burren National Park, a weirdly beautiful sea of 'fertile rock', so called because of its mixture of nutrient-rich herb and floral species. One of Oliver Cromwell's officers remarked of it in 1651: 'It is a country where there is not water enough to drown a man, wood enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury them. 'Yet their cattle are very fat. The grass grows in tufts of earth of two or three foot square which lies between the limestone rocks and is very sweet and nourishing.' We called on Martin Connolly, a cheery farmer on the Burren whose sons make delicious, dark Hazel Mountain chocolate, flavouring their product with berries and hazelnuts from the rocky hills above their property. A grand old dame of the highway: Peter conducted his road trip in a classic MGB Hardtop . They now supply the U.S. billionaire Donald Trump at his new hotel and golfing complex at Doonbeg, on the Atlantic coastline of County Clare. I don't suppose we covered more than 100 of the Wild Atlantic Way's 1,553 miles in our enjoyable, two-day visit. But I will be back there to drive some more - and to hike parts of the magical WAW - or, ride a bike alongside the wild Atlantic. The scenery's great, as is the food and the entertainment, but Ireland's people are its chief attraction. Their quirky sense of humour is refreshing, too. Since we were all 'spoken for' (more or less), we were careful to drive straight through Lisdoonvarna, County Clare. Their 'match-making festival' was on. Loose men and women - loose in the innocent sense of being 'free to marry' - socialised amiably on the main street. How they laughed when we told fellow guests at the Moy - nursing their malts in the 'honesty' bar - of driving pell mell through the loose ladies of Lisdoonvarna in our squeaking MGB, the Mini as rescue vehicle in case of breakdown. A great place to pull over: Peter's itinerary took him through Doolin, which is renowned for its music bars . Ireland's great poet, W. B. Yeats - whose home at Kiltartan, County Galway, we passed - said of one of his characters: 'He had an abiding sense of tragedy, which sustained him through temporary periods of joy.'

"A self-styled 'pick-up coach' accused of encouraging violence against women has been  banned from Britain today. Julien Blanc runs a company that claims to teach men to seduce women and make them 'beg' for sex but will no longer be able to fly in to the UK for a 'bootcamp'  next week. Critics say his methods, such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends, are abusive and controlling. He was due to run a seminar in Britain next week but more than 136,000 people signed a petition for him to be refused a visa and Home Office ministers have intervened. Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone said: 'Julien Blanc's presence in the UK could have led to an increase in sexual violence and harassment. I am delighted that Mr Blanc won't be coming to our shores.' Blanc has successfully been running £1,200-a-head seminars across the globe despite his own admission he is the 'most hated man in the world'. Scroll down for video . Blocked at border: 'Pick-up artist' Julien Blanc has been criticised over his sexually abusive and racist methods and is now  banned from coming to the UK . Shocking: Video footage shows the 25-year-old using racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat . Scandal: Blanc extols chat up methods such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends . Now Theresa May has reportedly intervened although the Home Office refused to comment. A source told Sky News that the Government is 'likely' to reject any visa application he makes. Caroline Charles, who is using a pseudonym, started the petition on Change.org. She said: 'I'm very pleased that we have achieved the outcome we wanted. I've said all along this isn't about me – the voices of the 158,000 people who signed have been heard. 'That the petition garnered so much attention in such a short period of time only highlights the everyday, ongoing relevance of sexism and misogyny. 'We cannot continue to ignore what is a daily reality for all women – particularly felt by transwomen and women of colour – by shielding men like Blanc behind the veneer of 'free speech.' 'Pick up coach' Julien Blanc joins a short list of people banned from the UK in recent years. 2014: French celebrity Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, right, was banned this year. The 'comedian', with convictions for inciting racial hatred, was at the centre of a Premier League anti-Semitism row. He said he would come to London to support then West Bromwich Albion striker Nicolas Anelka, who did a 'quenelle' salute. But the Home Office decided he was not allowed into the country, adding him to Britain's banned list. 2013: Conservative American bloggers Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer were banned. They are the founders of the anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America and they run the website Jihad Watch. Both were planning on speaking at an English Defence League march  in Woolwich, where Lee Rigby was murdered, but were stopped by the UK Border Agency . 2009: Far-right Dutch MP Geert WIlders was turned back at Heathrow as he tried to defy a ban on entering Britain. He was barred from the UK because he was likely to incite hatred and his visit a threat to 'community harmony and therefore public security'.  He was seized by border guards after his aircraft touched down, and questioned for more than an hour before flying back to the Netherlands. Last week a minister in her department, Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone, said that she was lobbying Mrs May to ban him, adding that she was 'extremely concerned by [his] sexist and utterly abhorrent statements'. Footage has emerged of Mr Blanc, 25, using racist language and grabbing women by the throat. One Twitter post says: 'Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie [spike] your own drink? #JustKidding.' His website says men can 'shortcircuit' a woman's 'logical mind' to get her into bed. A YouTube video shows him on the streets of Tokyo grabbing women and pushing their heads into his groin. He also reposted a chart used by support groups to identify signs of domestic abuse with the words: 'May as well be a checklist. #HowToMakeHerStay.' On his website he says people taught by him can 'make girls BEG to sleep with you after short-circuiting their emotional and logical mind into a million reasons why they should'. US-based Mr Blanc had to leave Australia last week when his visa was cancelled, and a similar campaign has been mounted to bar him from Canada. The woman behind the UK petition, using the pseudonym Caroline Charles, said: 'To allow someone into the UK who is explicitly promoting these things is abysmal.' Mr Blanc, who charges £1,200 for a three-day course, was due to host events in Britain on November 27 and December 19, with 11 more next year. He has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'. It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'. But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them. A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him urging men in the audience not to bother being 'polite' to Japanese women - but instead 'grab girls and shove their head' into their 'crotch.' Trip: Blanc was expected to come to Britain next week to run a two day seminar, pictured with comedian Russell Brand (left) RSD's website had been advertising a 'bootcamp' to teach the firm's techniques in London starting on November 27. Concern over Mr Blanc's ability to attend has already seen some customers inquire about a refund. A social media campaign in Australia saw him forced to cut short his visit there earlier this month. A Home Office spokesman said the department would not comment on individual cases, but added: 'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good or if their exclusion is justified on public policy grounds. 'It is longstanding practice that we do not comment on individual exclusion cases unless they are made public by the excluded individual. 'This Home Secretary has excluded more foreign nationals on the grounds of unacceptable behaviour than any before her.' His team did not respond to requests for comment. Home Secretary Theresa May – who has a long record of refusing those whose views and behaviour she considers unacceptable, has apparently intervened in the case .","Julien Blanc due to visit  Britain next week but his visa will be rejected .

"The glare of a low-lying sun - a particular problem for drivers each October - has contributed to an average of 28 road deaths a year since 2010, according to figures highlighted by the AA. Around 3,900 road users a year are injured after being dazzled by the sun, with north west England drivers the worst affected, the AA said. The motoring organisation drew attention to the figures as sunrise and sunset move into the morning and evening rush hours until the clocks go back on Sunday October 26. Scroll down for video . The glare of a low-lying sun - a particular problem for drivers each October - has contributed to an average of 28 road deaths a year since 2010, according to figures highlighted by the AA . One road where dazzle is a particular problem is the M4, which carries thousands of drivers towards London each morning and runs in a fairly straight west-east line from south Wales to the capital. At this time of year many M4 motorists have to contend with a low sun on their morning commute and then face being dazzled as the sun sets as they travel home in the evening. The AA said that in north west England, 2.2 people are killed or injured for each reported sun-dazzle accident - well above the national average of 1.4. Another badly affected area is Yorkshire and Humberside where the figure is 1.6. AA president Edmund King said: 'Many slower and more vulnerable road users - joggers, dog walkers, pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders - will be trying to take advantage of the last of the light evenings before the clocks go back. All road users need to be fully aware of the potential twilight dangers. The M4, which takes drivers towards London, is a particularly bad road for glare from the sun . 'Joggers, dog walkers, workers returning home on foot and other pedestrians walking with their backs to vehicles are almost twice as likely to be killed or seriously injured in road accidents.' Mr King went on: 'Research conducted for the AA, from official 2004 pedestrian casualty statistics, shows that 10.8 per cent of the 5,566 pedestrians killed or seriously injured when in the road were walking or running with their backs to the traffic. This compares with 5.9 per cent of the casualties who were facing oncoming cars. 'European research also shows that the rate of head-on crashes involving lorries nearly quadruples in twilight conditions. 'Although up to 10 per cent of accidents in which trucks leave the road, roll over, hit each other head-on or up the back happen in twilight conditions, up to 40 per cent of head-on accidents with cars happen when the sun is low in the sky. They also tend to happen on rural roads.'","Glare from the sun is a particular problem in October before clocks go back .

"Jailed: Father-of-two Derek Rigby was jailed for 30 months for the 'gross breach of trust' A care home worker repeatedly sneaked into an elderly dementia patient's bedroom and sexually molested her, a court heard. Derek Rigby, 44, was jailed for 30 months after he took advantage of the woman, aged in her eighties, who had suffered a series of mini strokes. The father-of-two was caught molesting the elderly patient after her concerned daughter  planted a 'nanny cam' in her bedroom at the  care home in the north east. Michael Stephenson, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court the victim's daughter became concerned a male carer was undressing her at night and coming in for a 'kiss and a cuddle'. Rigby was identified as the culprit after the secret camera caught him in the act. He was filmed coming into the victim's room to give her some medicine and then began to remove her bra and molest her. He also encouraged the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to perform an indecent act on him. The court heard the carer continued his campaign of abuse despite noticing a severe personality change in his victim after a series of strokes that left her 'disinhibited'. Rigby of Wigan, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to four charges of engaging in sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder between December 2013 and June this year. Joseph Kotrie-Monson, for Rigby, said his client was suffering from stress and exhaustion at the time and otherwise had an unblemished record from his six years in the care industry. He added Rigby's life was 'in tatters' but his wife and friends were standing by him. Jailing him for 30 months, Judge Andrew Menary QC said: 'Anyone who sees your actions on that night will be shocked and horrified at the gross breach of trust by you toward this vulnerable person. 'People who have relatives in care are entitled to expect that their loved ones will be looked after and cared for for appropriately and no subject to systematic sexual abuse at the hands of someone in a senior position.' Rigby was also ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and banned from working with vulnerable adults and children.

Impressively the race car was quicker off the mark than the jet, screeching off the line and pulling out an early lead. But there was only ever going to be one winner, and when the awesome power of the Hornet's two jet engines kicked in, it surged ahead before soaring off into the clouds. It is Ricciardo's first season with Red Bull with the 24-year-old replacing fellow Australian Mark Webber. His teammate Sebastian Vettel's is the reigning world champion. Red Bull, which is based in Milton Keynes have been struggling to adapt their car to the new rules for 2014 whilst maintaining their performance, with the biggest obstacle appearing to be incorporating the new turbo-charged 1.6 litre V6 engines with a host of energy-saving devices.

"A deaf couple have become the first people in Britain to record their baby's name in sign language on her birth certificate. Theatre director Paula Garfield, 47, and her partner Tomato Lichy, 39, from Wembley, north London, wanted to record Hazel's name in British Sign Language (BSL), but said they were initially told by their local Brent Register Office that it was impossible. Now their personal name for four-year-old Hazel, a reference to her smiling face, has pride of place on her birth certificate - as UbOtDDstarL. Scroll down for video . Sign of the times: Tomato Lichy and Paula Garfield's daughter Hazel has become the first person in Britain to have her sign name legally recorded on her birth certificate - where it has pride of place as UbOtDDstarL . Simple but effective: Tomato Lichy demonsrates his daughter's name, which begins as a small O-shape held at the chin with the thumb and forefinger before opening out into an L-shape across the chin . Hazel's sign name, like many others, is not simply the letters H-A-Z-E-L spelt out. Instead it is a made-up combination of symbols which, when taken in context, describes her personality in a way only her parents and friends can fully understand. Hazel's sign name is written as UbOtDDstarL, which represents a combination of hand movements. The U represents the chin, bO means a 'baby O' made with the thumb and forefinger, tD means 'hands facing the signer', Dstar means 'the handshape opens' and L shows the shape of the hand. Put that together and it makes a small O shape held at the chin, which then opens into an L shape. Ms Garfield told MailOnline she had a battle of up to nine months with the Register Office. The issue was finally sorted around four years ago, but the case has had little publicity. 'My daughter's sign name is what it is because her first expression was a smile,' she said. 'There's no way to translate it perfectly into English. 'But we went to the register office and they said it was ""ridiculous, you can't register a sign name, don't be silly"". So we got in touch with a solicitor, who said the law allows people to have their name on a birth certificate ""in their own language"".' The couple officially named their daughter Hazel. But her sign name is formed by a change from a closed to open index and thumb handshape near the chin . The couple consulted with a linguist how to officiate on paper their daughter's sign name, and with the help of a lawyer have now managed to record their daughter's British Sign Language name .

Put together, that makes a small O shape with the thumb and forefinger held at the chin, which then opens out into an L shape. A spokesman for the British Deaf Association said: 'When you come up with a sign name it's often as a result of a characteristic. Judging by the type of symbols in this name, the parents might have noticed Hazel smiles or laughs a lot. 'With other people, if they talk a lot for example their sign name might include wiggling fingers at their mouth. 'But there's no exact translation. Hazel's isn't a specific name or spelt out. It all depends on the context of the relationship with the child.' By an unusual coincidence, both of the couple's children are deaf - but they say they couldn't be happier. Ms Garfield said: 'We're the best possible parents for them'. Mr Lichy said he had tried to register his first daughter Molly's name in British Sign Language but was told it was not possible. When his second daughter came along, he told bslzone he was more determined. He said: 'Why did (the name) have to be registered in English? British Sign Language (BSL) has been recognised, why could we not have it in BSL?' They consulted with a linguist how to officiate on paper their daughter's sign name, and with the help of a lawyer have now managed to record their daughter's British Sign Language name. Happy: Hazel is completely unaware of her significance as she crawls around her parents' London home . The little girl's name is written in sign notation as UbOtDDstarL. It is formed by a change from a closed to open index and thumb handshape near the chin . Tomato, who changed his name from Tom aged 20 because it was a more 'visual, strong name', was the one who came up with the idea. Ms Garfield said that she had originally dismissed her partner's desire to register Hazel's name in BSL. But she said: 'Looking back I realised Tomato was right. 'We've been so used to having our language dismissed and we've accepted that. The law is there, and we have rights. 'Sign language is stronger than we thought.'

"Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, arrived in Canada tonight on a break-neck tour of the country. The royal couple will visit three provinces, six towns and cities and undertake a staggering 41 engagements in just three days. The heir to throne is notorious for the pace of his foreign trips on behalf of the UK government, packing more into them than any other member of the Royal Family. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles and Camilla arrived at Robert L. Stanfield International Airport in Halifax yesterday . But this latest trip to Canada - his 17th to the country where his mother, the Queen, is still head of state - is challenging by even his standards. Charles and Camilla arrived on a Canadian Air Force Jet in Halifax tonight where they were greeted at the international airport by dignitaries and then met with the Governor General, the monarch's representative in the country. The Duchess was wearing a cream silk shirt-waister dress with a gold and black tweedy coat by one of her favourite designers, Fiona Clare. She was carrying a black clutch bag given to her by a Canadian friend on her last visit to the country. Camilla was presented with a bouquet of flowers by Grace Elizabeth Lenihan, three, and Molly Jane Lenihan, nine . The couple met with the Governor General His Excellency Mr David Johnston and his wife Mrs Sharon Johnston and exchanged polite small talk in front of the cameras for a few minutes. Asked to stand in a different position for the official photocall, the prince said: 'This is like musical chairs.' The Governor General added: 'You will accuse us of cruel and unusual punishment. ' Charles is later set to take part in a swearing in ceremony after being made a member of the Canadian Privy Council by the country's Prime Minister. The only other member to be awarded the honour is his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, in 1957. Although Canada has welcomed four official visits by the Royal Family in four years - the Queen in 2010, then-newlyweds Prince William and Kate in 2011, and Charles and Camilla in 2012 - the Canadian secretary to the Queen says there is still a deep fascination with the royal family. 'There's a great deal of excitement and expectation about this royal tour,' says Kevin MacLeod, who has worked on some 20 royal tours since 1987. Their official welcome to Canada, where Charles will make his first of four planned speeches, will take place Monday morning near the cenotaph outside Halifax City Hall. Later at the city's Public Gardens, Charles will plant an English oak tree - a tradition started 75 years ago by his grandfather, King George VI. At historic Pier 21 and the Canadian Museum of Immigration, the couple will meet with war brides and veterans of the Second World War. They will also travel to the community of Pictou where they will learn about the province's Celtic roots, visit street stalls and watch a musical performance at Hector Quay. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, speak with Grace Elizabeth Lenihan, three, and Molly Jane Lenihan, nine, as they arrive at Robert L. Stanfield International Airport in Halifax . That evening the couple will fly on to Prince Edward Island for a Victoria Day fireworks display. Tuesday sees them spend the morning in Charlottetown, visiting the Legislative Chamber and attending a youth parliament debate. The Prince of Wales will also be honoured with a medal recognising his contributions to Canada and deliver his second speech of the tour. Charles and Camilla will tour the city's arts centre guided by an actress playing the region's most famous export -  Anne of Green Gables - before flying to Winnipeg. On Wednesday, their last day in the country, the couple will undertake a staggering 16 engagements between them. The royal couple will visit three provinces, six towns and cities and undertake a staggering 41 engagements in just three days . The highlight is set to be Charles feeding a polar bear named Hudson at the local zoo and learning about another famous regional bear - Winnie the Pooh. The original Winnie was a female black bear who was bought as a small cub for $20 in Onatario by a Lt Harry Colebourn of The Fort Garry Horse, a Canadian Cavalry Regiment, en route to the Western Front during the First World War. The bear was smuggled into Britain as the regiment's unofficial mascot with veterinarian Lt Colebourn naming her after his home city of Winnipeg. Before leaving for France he decided to leave her at London Zoo where she become something of a local star and much admired, among others, by AA Milne's son, Christopher Robin. Prince Charles was greeted by the Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, and Member of Parliament for Central Nova, the Honourable Peter MacKay . Christopher Robin subsequent changed the name of his own teddy from Edward Bear to Winnie the Pooh, providing the inspiration for his father's much loved books. Charles and Camilla will leave Canada on Wednesday evening and fly back to the UK overnight. Robert Finch, chairman of the Monarchist League of Canada, said he believed Charles still spoke to Canadians, both young and old. 'Things like the environment, bridging the gap between different religions, these are things that Canadians -- even young Canadians -- really gravitate toward, ' he said.","The heir to throne is notorious for the pace of his foreign trips on behalf of the UK government .

"Julia Bradbury is pregnant again at the age of 44, three years after the difficult pregnancy of her first child. She had longed for a sibling for her son Zephyr but, in her forties and diagnosed with endometriosis, she had accepted that this may never happen. However, yesterday the TV presenter announced she was ‘ecstatically happy to be pregnant’ following a course of IVF. ‘It’s no secret that our son Zephyr was a longed-for baby, and we are thrilled at the prospect of having a brother or sister for him,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Julia Bradbury is pregnant again at the age of 44, three years after the difficult pregnancy of her first child . The Countryfile presenter underwent a course of IVF, and can now fulfil her wish of giving her son a sibling . ‘As an older mum I feel incredibly lucky. I’ve reached the three-month mark and am keeping as fit and healthy as possible’. The number of women giving birth in their forties is nearly double that of 1990 and four times that of the 1980s. The rise has been put down to the number of women who now go to university and start a career before having children. According to the Office for National Statistics, in 2012, there were 28,714 pregnancies in England and Wales where the mother was over the age of 40. In the same year, the number of mothers over 40 overtook teenage pregnancies for the first time. The Countryfile presenter, nicknamed the walking man’s crumpet after all the outdoor TV programmes she has presented, had her first child at the age of 41, two years after she began dating property developer Gerard Cunningham, 55. She was far from sure she could ever have children. As well as being over 40, she had also been diagnosed with endometriosis, a painful condition affecting the womb. When it came to the birth itself, there were further problems when she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia which, if left untreated, can be dangerous to both mother and baby. The birth, an experience she has described as ‘traumatic towards the end’, had to be induced. However, at the end of last year, Miss Bradbury said: ‘I would love Zeph to have a brother or sister but I am 43 and have to be realistic.’ Her new primetime ITV show The Wonder of Britain will be aired early next year.","Countryfile presenter had longed for a sibling for her young son Zephyr .

"A family in Los Angeles have told of their horror at returning home to find one of their dogs dead and another in a critical condition after being attacked by a swarm of killer bees. Justin and Heather Umphenours made the shocking discovery on Sunday at their house in Covina, finding their two German Shepherd-mixes collapsed in the backyard surrounded by hundreds of bees. One dog, Luna, died from her injuries, while her brother, Wolf, was rushed to Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic. 'They're members of the family - we've had them since they were four weeks old. They were abandoned,' Mr Umphenours told KTLA. Killed: German Shepherd-mix Luna died on Sunday after being stung hundreds of times by a swarm of bees . Fighting for life: Wolf survived the attack but is struggling to recover from hundreds of stings, most of them in his face and mouth . Swarm: Justin and Heather Umphenours said they returned to their Covina home to find hundreds of bees swarming their two dogs . Heartbroken: Justin and Heather Umphenours have called neighbors and local schools in an effort to prevent the same thing from happening to anyone else . 'To see something like that - to see your animals lying on the ground helpless - is just heartwrenching.' The wild honeybees in the San Gabriel Valley are known as killer bees. Hybrids of European and African strains, they aggressively protect their hives by attacking in swarms, the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District told The Los Angeles Daily News. However the Umphenours, who have four children, say they have never seen bees near their home in the seven years they have lived there. The family said they spent Saturday cutting down branches of lemon trees in their backyard. While they didn't see any hives, they worry the yard work somehow stirred up the bees. 'It's horrific enough that it happened to our animals,' Mrs Umphenours said. 'To know that it might happen to someone else's family - I just don't want that to happen.' Critical: Wolf, who remains at the Inland Valley Emergency Pet Clinic, was stung primarily on his face . Scene: The family spent Saturday trimming lemon trees in their yard, which may have spurred the bee attack . Best friends: The family had the dogs - both abandoned - since they were four-weeks-old . Wolf continues to fight for his life at the animal hospital. Several hundred stingers have already been removed from his tongue. The vet said the stings inside the dog's mouth came from him biting at the bees. He was mostly stung in his face. A friend of the Umphenours has set up a Go Fund Me account help raise money for Wolf’s vet bills, which were expected to exceed $6000.","Attack occurred Sunday at a home in Covina, Los Angeles .

"Prince William has hailed the new First World War Galleries at the Imperial War Museum as  a ‘spectacular’ tribute to the courage and dedication of the men and women who sacrificed their lives for freedom. Touring the London landmark, originally opened by his own great-great grandfather, King George V, in 1920, the prince said the exhibition vividly brought home the brutal realities of the war and demonstrated why the conflict is still relevant today. A £40million renovation supported by Daily Mail readers has seen the Southwark musuem transformed into a living, interactive tribute to all those affected by conflict. Scroll down for video .

At its heart are the First World War Galleries which feature original objects, such as letters and diaries from the frontline, in interactive multi-media displays, bringing to life the stories of those who lived through and died in the Great War, which started 100 years ago next month. William, who in 2010 became patron of the IWM Foundation’s First World War Centenary Campaign, was given a tour by Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust and chairman of the IWM Foundation, and his wife, Lady Rothermere. Lord Rothermere’s great-grandfather, the 1st Viscount Rothermere, donated the museum’s present site to the nation after losing two of his three sons in the First World War. William, who last year left the military himself after serving in the both the Army and the RAF, was visibly moved by the displays. The future king then joined fellow VIP guests, including Prime Minister David Cameron, to speak in the central hall.

'As we know only too well, it wasn’t. A war that took hundreds of thousands of young lives has been followed by many other conflicts, woven through history to the present day. ‘In 1920, King George believed this museum would be an inspiration for future generations. I am very pleased to say, it is.’ After the visit Lord Rothermere said he was ‘incredibly proud’ of all those who had been involved in the project. ‘The IWM, and particularly the First World War Galleries, is a record of the toil and sacrifice of a generation and will, we hope, appeal to as many young people as possible,’ he said.

"Ethan Roberts, one, suffocated to death after getting trapped between his cot and the door while left for 15 minutes without his parents . A one-year-old boy left at home alone for 15 minutes suffocated to death after getting trapped as he tried to climb out of his cot, an inquest heard today. Ethan Roberts was found hanging two feet above the ground after his head became stuck between the end of his cot and the door in the family's mobile home in Aldermaston, Berkshire. An inquest into his death heard Ethan and his twin brother Mitch had been left alone by their parents while they marshalled a race day at the family-owned racetrack. The pair were stationed just one minute away from where the mobile home was based, the court was told. But his mother Ginny only realised what had happened when she heard Mitch crying over the baby monitor she was carrying. She raced back to the mobile home, where she found Ethan motionless. The young boy was given CPR and driven to hospital in an ambulance, but died of catastrophic brain injuries three days later. He had been due to celebrate his second birthday six days later. Today, a coroner at West Berkshire Coroner's Court in Newbury recorded a narrative verdict into the young boy's death, describing the incident as a 'tragic accident'. During the inquest, the court heard the youngster had been put to bed along with his twin brother in the mobile home in July this year. In a written statement, Mrs Roberts told the court that the young boys, who had been left with their ten-year-old brother Joshua, were less than a minute away from where she was stationed. She also described how she was carrying an ultra-sensitive baby monitor which was connected to a receiver under Ethan's cot. The hearing heard how Mrs Roberts usually placed Ethan's cot right up against the door so that the youngsters could not get out if she ever left the mobile home. But she said the weather was so hot that the family decided to move the cot slightly further away from the door. She also unlocked the door so a breeze could go into the mobile home. But, when Mrs Roberts heard crying through the baby monitor, she rushed back to the mobile home. There, she found Mitch crying while Ethan was found hanging, motionless. The statement read: 'It must have been about 1pm, I heard crying and screaming through the baby monitor. 'I heard Mitch calling me and he was crying. I saw my bedroom door was open and Mitch was sat there crying. Ethan was there, blue and motionless, between the cot and the door frame. 'Ethan's head was facing down and his neck was on the door frame and his body was hanging over the ledge. 'I think he tried to climb out of his cot the wrong way and has fallen wrong and he's ended with his head and shoulders between the cot and both sides of the door frame and he couldn't move. An inquest found that the toddler's death in July this year was a 'tragic accident' 'I pushed the cot away and picked him up and legged it. I screamed for help and my brother-in-law came to me and took Ethan across the race track to the paramedics who were on site. I ran across to the ambulance and they were resuscitating Ethan.' She told the hearing how the twin babies had already overcome adversity just to be alive. Mitch was born with a heart condition while Ethan had undergone extensive blood sugar level tests in his short life. As Mrs Roberts fought back tears, Assistant Coroner for Berkshire Emma Jones told her: 'You were a very vigilant mother. 'You took them to the doctor's whenever you had any concerns to do with their health.' Ethan was rushed first to the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke and then to the specialist paediatric intensive care unit at Southampton General Hospital. He died there on July 16 this year. The court heard the twins slept in cots in a partitioned off section of their parents' bedroom. They also shared the mobile home with their older brother Joshua and sister Amy, seven. Members of the family including Ethan's paternal grandparents, Gwen and Colin Roberts, and his aunt and uncle, Christopher and Marianne Roberts, also live and work at the Aldermaston Raceway site. The track hosts up to 20 amateur races a year. The family wept uncontrollably today as they heard the tragic series of events which led to the youngster's death. In a statement to the inquest, the boy's father Mitch Roberts said: 'When it all happened I was on the other side of the track. I didn't expect to see what I saw - Ethan being given CPR by the ambulance crew. 'Ginny was in a state she was screaming. Ginny said that when she found Ethan his head was stuck between the door and the cot. He was half in and half out of the door. Ethan was rushed first to the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke and then to the specialist paediatric intensive care unit at Southampton General Hospital (pictured). He died there on July 16 this year . 'I think that somehow the twins have opened the door and Ethan has tried to get out squeezing through the gap and got his head stuck.' Grandmother Gwen told the coroner: 'I was stood by the door in race control and I heard this horrific scream, something I will never forget. I saw Ginny running and screaming.' Her son Malcolm Roberts took Ethan's lifeless body from his mother's arms and rushed him across the racetrack to the waiting ambulance after she rushed out of the mobile home screaming and wailing. He said: 'I took Ethan off Ginny - he was limp and unresponsive. Ethan wasn't breathing and I began shouting and screaming for Mitch. I was hysterical, I'd done all I could. Mitch's sister, Kerry Roberts, told the hearing in a statement that she had been helping Joshua look after the boys that morning and put them to bed. She said: 'I thought about moving the cots further away from the door because I thought ""What if they get out of their cots and no one heard them, they would bang their heads."" That's the worst I thought would happen so I moved the cots around one foot away from the door.' She said she heard the screaming later on when Ginny came rushing out with Ethan in her arms. 'Ginny said, ""He's dead, he's blue, he's not breathing."" From this moment it was bedlam - everywhere I looked there were family members standing looking stunned.' On site paramedics James Bishop and Neil Morgan, who were overseeing safety at the race day, told the hearing they had performed CPR and mouth to mouth resuscitation on the youngster, whose oxygen supply could have been cut off for more than 10 minutes before he was found. Mr Bishop said he asked Mr Roberts, who he did not initially know was the youngster's father, to drive the ambulance to nearby Basingstoke Hospital so they could continue their efforts to revive Ethan en route. Despite doctors being able to get the Ethan's heart running again when he arrived at hospital in Basingstoke, on July 13 this year, a CT scan revealed he had suffered fatal brain damage caused by the oxygen supply to his brain being cut off. Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said: 'This was a tragic accident caused by Ethan becoming trapped by his neck between his cot and the wall of his home address and dying of asphyxiation.'","Ethan Roberts tried to crawl out of cot after being left alone for 15 minutes .

"The University of New Mexico says a psychology professor's tweet that people battling obesity don't have the willpower to finish a doctorate degree wasn't part of any research project as he had previously claimed.

Miller posted on Twitter last month that obese doctoral applicants who don't 'have the will power to stop eating carbs' won't 'have the willpower to do a dissertation'. Academic slip-up: Visiting NYU professor Geoffrey Miller caused outrage when he tweeted this message last month . The tweet has since been deleted and . his Twitter account been made private. Miller later apologized and said . the tweet was part of a research project. Miller is on leave from UNM while serving as a visiting professor at New York University.

Geoffrey Miller, who specializes in evolutionary psychology, tweeted on June 2: 'Dear obese PhD applicants: If you don't . have the willpower to stop eating carbs, you won't have the willpower to . do a dissertation. #truth.' It is understood that he will keep his job as a visiting professor at NYU's Stern School of Business. Crass: The professor, who has tenure at the University of New Mexico, quickly apologized for his remarks . Professor Miller quickly deleted the message after a . backlash from students and professors alike.

"A little boy made a powerful argument as to why he should have a cupcake for dinner - and the video his mother took of him making it went viral. Three-year-old Mateo didn't want to eat dinner. He felt that since he'd already eaten lunch, a cupcake would make a suitable compromise. When this argument failed to win over his mother Linda Beltran, he decided he might have better luck with his grandmother. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A born politician: Mateo makes a rambling yet adorable argument for cupcakes . Beltran says that if Mateo thinks he has a valid argument, he's sure to speak his mind. This time, Beltran happened to have her phone with her so she hit record just as Mateo got into his stride. Mateo, looking up at his mother and unaware he's being filmed, entreats his mother to 'Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me!' While most of the argument is unintelligible, the gist seems to be that he deserves a cupcake and definitely not 'pow pows in the butt [a spanking].' Increasingly desperate: Despite Mateo's arguments, his mother does not agree, leading to further reasoning . His love for his little brother Kevin is admirable, too. Linda says that she's going to have to spank both Mateo and Kevin, but Mateo says she shouldn't spank him, nor his little brother. 'But he's my little Pa-Paps!' he says. The video goes for two minutes and 35 seconds, but arguably the most hilarious part comes at 1:42, when he begins to refer to his mother as 'honey.' 'Linda, honey, honey, lookit, look at this,' he says. Beltran says Mateo calls her Linda when he is very serious and wants to make sure she is paying attention. 'Linda, honey, honey': Even in the face of such convincing sweet-talk, Linda Beltran doesn't give in to her son . He began using his parents' first names after the family went on a trip to a theme park and came across a little boy who had lost his family. He didn't know his parents' names, other than Mommy and Daddy, and Beltran and her husband realized their children might not know their names either, in a similar situation. Knowing his parents first names, Beltran said, 'made Mateo feel a little empowered.' 'For the most part we are still Mommy and Daddy,  but when he is serious and wants to make sure we are paying attention, we quickly become Linda and Kenneth,' she told UberConference blog. Beltran says Mateo is never disrespectful, but loves to engage in healthy debate. 'The boys know when mom is serious and when they can engage in some healthy debate. In an effort to raise my kids with a voice, I pick my battles and sometimes let them feel like they’ve won... or at least give them the chance to try!'","Three-year-old Mateo was videoed arguing with his mother, who he calls 'Linda'

"A six-year-old hailed as one of Britain's most spoilt children has decided she's had enough of her reputation - and is giving away her prized possessions. Lacie Pope, of Plymouth, Devon, has always been treated to glamorous designer frocks, expensive beauty products and jewel-encrusted toys. Her mother Lisa Whitcombe, 34, loves to spoil her with Armani and Dior outfits, her own crown and even a child's Audi covered in crystals. Thinking of others: Lacie is giving up her Audi covered toy car worth £1,500 for charity . Little princess: Lacie is auctioning off her crown £80 and crystal covered tutu . But on the eve of her sixth birthday - with £2,000 worth of celebrations ahead of her - Lacie has decided it's time to share her wealth. She told her parents she wants to give all her birthday presents to charity. Her mother said Lacie had a crisis of conscience while watching a TV show Stand Up To Cancer. Lacie is now auctioning off some of her belongings for charity, including an Audi covered toy car worth £1,500. Lisa, a mother-of-three and former glamour model, said: 'Before her birthday Lacie just decided that she wanted to give all her presents away - I was pretty shocked. 'It all came from watching a TV show about Stand Up To Cancer. She was crying all the way through it. Sharing: The little girl has decided to give away some of her toys after being moved by the plight of children touched by cancer . 'She couldn't stand the idea that there are children out there who have lost a parent to cancer, or have don't have food on the table. 'She decided that seeing as it was her birthday coming up that she would give away all her presents. 'Initially I didn't think she was being serious but Lacie was going on about it for days. 'She was stuck on the idea that she wanted to do something to help so in the end I had to agree. 'Over time I guess she realised it's just too much for any child, especially with her birthday and Christmas just around the corner. 'She doesn't want people thinking she's spoilt.' Reputation: Lacie doesn't want people to think she's spoilt so she's taking action . Lacey Pope pictured during a pamper party thrown by her mother. Lacie is centre and left to right are friends Georgia Crombie, Shayia Pope, Lexi May Hoskin, Alyssia Evers-Avery and Daniel Pope behind . Lacie's generous giveaway will also include a set of customised Cinderella slippers worth £45, a tutu covered in £65 worth of crystals, and a Swarovski crystal encrusted crown - worth around £80. Despite lavishing around £2,000 on the birthday celebrations Lisa says she's happy to fulfill her daughter's wishes and proud she wants to help others. Lacie is set to feature in the upcoming Channel 5 programme Blinging Up Baby, which features some of Britain's most pampered kids. But while Lisa and her partner Cieran, a car salesman, admit they like to treat Lacie and their two other children, Daniel, four, and 10-week-old Emily-Ashley, they deny taking money for granted. The family previously lived in a £350,000 villa in the glamorous Spanish resort of Marbella but have recently moved back to the UK. Lisa, now a community nurse, says her daughter's wardrobe is stuffed full of expensive brands. The youngster has also been booked in do catwalk training in London so she can follow in her mum's modelling footsteps. Lisa said: 'She does wears Armani, Dior, Chanel and Juicy Couture - but nothing fancy, just normal clothes. 'As a family we go to the salon to get our hair and nails done but there's nothing wrong with that. We do shop at Asda and Debenhams as well. 'I like to keep the kids looking nice. I am the world's biggest critic when it comes to looks but I think that a well presented child is a confident child. 'What with all the filming, she's had a great time and a lot of special days out. 'They would hire out an entire swimming pool or an indoor play area and to Lacie it was just more and more treats. 'Over time I guess she realised it's just too much for any child, especially with her birthday and Christmas just around the corner. Raising money: The bespoke Audi will be auctioned off to raise funds for Hugs for Henry, a charity set up to support four-year-old Henry Hallam who is fighting a rare form of cancer . 'I think I can take some credit as a parent for the fact that she realised it was the right thing to do, I'm quite chuffed really. 'We're not sure where the presents are going yet. Lacie's only request is that they go towards making another child happy. 'She thinks it's really sad that some children don't have food, or parents, and she wants to make them happy.' Lisa says the bespoke Audi will probably be auctioned off to raise funds for Hugs for Henry, a charity set up to support four-year-old Henry Hallam who is fighting a rare form of cancer. The rest of the gifts will either go to a charity shop or be sold off. Lisa added: 'I don't know why we are being featured in 'Blinging Up Baby' - we're just a normal family really. 'Maybe it's because we lived in Marbella, I don't know. My children are just normal. 'I think that any parent who has the means to supply for their children should be able to do so in whatever way they want. 'I would never put real fur on a child or give them a Rolex but I do like to treat them on their birthdays. 'Spoiling my children is done in moderation, just on birthdays and Christmas. I have been there when I can't afford presents and you don't have a thing for the kids. 'The year Lacie was born I found myself out of work and we did all we could just to get the Christmas dinner on the table and a couple of presents from Poundland. 'I'm not stuck up and we're completely appreciative of what we have got. I would be heart-broken if our children turned out to be self-centred but I'm very confident they won't.'","Lacie Pope, of Plymouth, Devon, wears Armani, Dior and Chanel .

"A passer-by saved the life of a three-month-old baby on Monday when he crawled into a car that was upside-down in water, used a knife to cut the straps off the car seat and pulled her out. The accident happened on Monday when Stephen McGouldrick, 55, lost control of his SUV on an icy road and skidded down an embankment into almost three feet of water. Police said passer-by Leo Moody, of Kingman, crawled into the SUV and freed the baby girl in Kossouth Township, Maine. The SUV was submerged in three feet of water after the driver slid off the road in Kossouth Township, Maine. A baby in a carseat was pulled free by a Good Samaritan . The infant was submerged for a short time and was not breathing and unresponsive when pulled free. Another passer-by, Wade Shorey, a married father who had recently learned CPR on a course, resuscitated the child. She was taken to Eastern Maine Medical Center for observation. State Police Trooper Chad Lindsey told Bangor Daily News that the vehicle went off an embankment airborne and landed on its roof in a stream. Mr McGouldrick and two other passengers, Brenda Haney, 53, of Calais, and the child's mother, Beverly Metcalf, 34, of Talmadge, suffered minor injuries and were treated and released from hospital. Mr McGouldrick's sister commented on social media: 'so glad my brother Stevie and everyone else is ok...someone was deff watching over them....' Mr Shorey later commented on his heroic actions on social media. He said: 'A special thanks to all the other [sic] that helped in any fashion, especially John for being a brave man to be in ice cold water pulling the baby out and Marie for a warm truck.'

"A violent man has been caught on CCTV attacking estate agent staff in a row over a £100 deposit despite never having been a customer at the branch. Three women were left terrified when the unknown man burst into Lovett International letting agents in Bournemouth, Dorset and shouted and screamed obscenities at them before throwing everything off one of the desks. The same man is also said to have shouted at workers at a different branch two weeks earlier, with staff reporting both incidents to the police and sending them CCTV footage of the incident. Scroll down for video . The violent man approaches the front door of Lovett International letting agents in Bournemouth, leaving his bike in the entrance . He then bursts through the door and begins to shout and scream obscenities at the terrified staff behind their desks . But despite 10 phone calls and emails sent over the course of a week, officers have still not responded to the complaint and have been forced to apologise for their lack of action. Maximillian De Kment, who runs the agency said the enraged man is not a client and believes he has mistaken his business with another firm the man has an ongoing complaint with. He said that since the attacks, his staff have now resorted to keeping the door locked and fear the man could come back, possibly with a weapon. He explained: 'He used a lot of swear words but in between those he seemed to have a beef that someone had stolen his £100 deposit. The then starts pointing as his aggressive rant in the office in Bournemouth continues . The whole incident was captured on the shop's CCTV cameras but despite informing the police, they are yet to respond to the complaint . 'He's obviously got muddled up in some way. None of the staff recognised him. 'The first incident there were five fairly robust gentlemen there and he quickly darted out the door. 'The second incident happened at an office containing three female employees. 'We've got perfect CCTV footage but the police aren't even interested in that. 'My fear is that everything could escalate if the police don't deal with it and caution him. 'Next time he might come in with a knife. What's the point of the police dealing with it then when I've got a fatality on my hands? After ranting at the staff over a £100 deposit, the man then leans forward towards one staff member's desk . He then throws all of the items off desk as the three female staff members look on in horror . 'People like that need to be cautioned to prevent a much larger action in the future. 'I emailed the police four times, which we still haven't had a response to, and we also called. The staff called at least five times and I called four or five times as well. 'We have the doors locked on a permanent basis now and I'm having to install specialist buttons on the desks so staff can buzz people they recognise in. 'But it's not the image you want of the trade. It's just not right. 'I've done everything I can for the security of my staff. In my other shop there's five different camera positions. It might seem over the top for a shop that doesn't handle cash but I've done that for my staff. After the rant, the man walks out of the shop. It is believed his complaint is with another letting agents in the area . 'I've bought expensive CCTV so the footage can be passed on to the police and investigated but half my plan seems to be falling down.' Inspector Alan Setchell, of Dorset police, explained that the incident had wrongly been down-graded by staff which is why it was not immediately investigated. He said: 'An officer did call back to explain that we were unable to attend straight away and that someone would be round as soon as possible. 'The incident was mistakenly then reclassified as a lower priority which resulted in a slow response due to officer availability and the number of incidents that had been classified at a higher priority level. 'We clearly let them down on this occasion and I would like to apologise to Mr De Kment and staff at the two addresses for any distress this has caused.'","Angry man burst into Lovett International letting agents in Bournemouth .

"A NASA space craft which helped paved the way putting man on the moon encountered a issue of a far more earthly kind this week when it was given a parking ticket in downtown Boston. Traffic officers were unhappy at the time it was taking for the two tonne 1960s Gemini space capsule to be delivered to RR Auction saleroom and handed auctioneer Bobby Livingston a fine. The capsule - which is considered a piece of space history, having been used in the testing of highly dangerous missions that resulted in the first ever space walks - is due to go on sale at the auction house tomorrow with a $50,000 asking price. No parking: Traffic officers were unhappy at the time it was taking for the two tonne 1960s Gemini space capsule to be delivered to RR Auction saleroom and handed auctioneer Bobby Livingston (right) a fine . Not enough space: The capsule - which is considered a piece of space history, having been used in the testing of highly dangerous missions that resulted in the first ever space walks - is due to go on sale at the Bostom auction house tomorrow . A piece of space history: An image taken from Gemini 6 with views of Gemini 7 and earth, taken in December 1965 . Mr Livingston said was taking delivery of the enormous capsule, part of NASA's ground-breaking Project Gemini space missions, when he was handed the fine. At more than nine feet tall, weighing two tonnes and spacious enough to fit two people, prospective bidders will have to make sure they have plenty of room to store the capsule before splashing out. The Gemini missions paved the way for putting man on the moon with the Apollo space programme by testing longer space flights and perfecting methods of re-entry and landing. Following the success of Apollo in the late 1960s NASA turned their attention to the space shuttle programme which resulted in the building of the International Space Station. Much of the redundant equipment from previous missions was sold off in the 1970s to create space for the new technologies to be developed and tested. At more than nine feet tall, weighing two tonnes and spacious enough to fit two people, prospective bidders will have to make sure they have plenty of room to store the capsule before paying the $50,000 asking price . Describing the history of the capsule, one of seven made for the Gemini project, Mr Livingston said that after the NASA clear out the capsule was acquired along with a number of items by a former employee named Charles Bell . When Mr Bell died in 2000 the capsule was discovered rotting among his vast collection of space junk in his back garden . The capsule will go under the hammer at Mr Livingston's RR Auction saleroom in Boston, Massachusetts, for $50,000 - around £35,000. Mr Livingston, president of RR Auction, said: 'These capsules were used by NASA to test how the spacecraft would react on landing. 'Seven were made in total for the Mercury space missions, the second manned space flight NASA conducted,' he added. 'When NASA started developing the space shuttle following the Apollo missions they needed space so they had a massive clear-out of equipment that was by that point redundant,' he went on to say. Project Gemini was NASA's second human spaceflight program, with ten manned flights occurring between 1965 and 1966. Similar in design to the Mercury capsule but much larger, the new Gemini spacecraft was designed to carry two astronauts into Earth orbit to test long-duration flight, rendezvous and docking and other technologies needed for later journies to the moon . Astronauts Neil Armstrong and David Scott sit with their spacecraft hatches open while awaiting the arrival of the recovery ship, the USS Leonard F. Mason after the successful completion of their Gemini VIII mission in March 16, 1966. Three years later Armstrong was a member of the three man crew on board Apollo 11 and became the first human ever to walk on the surface of the moon . Describing the history of the capsule, one of seven made for the Gemini project, Mr Livingston said that after the NASA clear out the capsule was acquired along with a number of items by a former employee  named Charles Bell. When Mr Bell died in 2000 the capsule was discovered rotting among his vast collection of space junk. It was bought by the current owner who set about restoring the capsule to its former glory. 'It is in incredible piece of space history but any prospective buyer will have to have the space to house it - it's 9ft tall and weighs 2.5 tonnes,' Mr Livingston said. 'There is a real market for memorabilia from the early days of space exploration, especially capsules such as this - they're pretty rare,' he added. 'It would be a perfect tourist attraction for an institution but we've also had interest from private collectors... Anyone who buys this capsule will have to make sure they can home it - it's huge,' Mr Livingston went on to say. The Gemini missions paved the way for putting man on the moon with the Apollo space programme by testing longer space flights and perfecting methods of re-entry and landing . Photographs show re-entry tests involving a Project Gemini capsule and a paraglider in the early 1960s . Project Gemini was launched on January 3, 1962. It followed on from NASA's Mercury projects which put man into space and allowed NASA to trial longer flights deeper into space. Astronauts were able to test methods of manoeuvring and docking with other space craft and perfect ways of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. Famous astronauts who flew on the Gemini missions include Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first humans ever to land on the moon, and Jim Lovell, commander of Apollo 13. The auction will be held tomorrow.","Traffic officers were unhappy at time it took for Gemini space capsule to be delivered to a Boston auction house .

"A father has been arrested for assault after his own daughter posted a video on Snapchat apparently showing him attacking a teenager during a road rage altercation. Steven Paula, 43, allegedly attacked 18-year-old Mason Deal in Parker, Colorado, leaving him with a black eye and a concussion - and his daughter caught the whole episode on her cell phone. Police say that the girl then posted the video on Snapchat and a screenshot was saved by a friend, before the footage was deleted. The image was then passed on to a friend of the victim and was shared with the police. The image - which appears to show Paula swinging at Mr Deal - allowed police to identify him as their suspect . Mason Deal, 18, said the incident occurred while he was heading along a stretch of road in Parker, Colorado . According to Fox 31 Denver, police initially had very little to go on, but the single image - which appears to show Paula swinging at Mr Deal - allowed them to identify him as their suspect. Mr Deal told the news channel: 'Part of me feels bad for her thinking that it was okay to post something like that on social media - and think it was funny - but at the same time she gave us everything we needed and for that I'm grateful.' He said the incident occurred while he was heading along a stretch of road in Parker, some 20 miles from Denver, that merges from two lanes to one. The suspect allegedly tried to pass him  and the two cars clipped each other. Mr Deal recalled stopping his car and seeing the other driver getting out of his minivan. He said he thought the man was going to ask him for his insurance information, but instead he attacked the teenager. Steven Paula, 43, allegedly attacked a teenager, leaving him with a black eye and a concussion . 'Social media is a powerful thing,' Mr Deal's father Mike said in an interview with Fox 31 Denver. 'If we didn't have that one image we would be sitting here today wondering who did this.' Mike deal added that it was 'incredibly fortunate for us' but 'incredibly thoughtless and stupid' of Paula's daughter to post the video of the attack on Snapchat. Police said Paula was booked with misdemeanor assault because no weapon was used and there was no permanent injury to the victim.

"A Montana couple has been charged after allegedly letting a 2-year-old boy smoke marijuana. Lucas Keith Wilson and Camilla Rose Samuels have been charged with felony and misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Wilson was brought to the Gallatin County Detention Center on Friday and is being held on a $50,000 bond, but Samuels is still at large. Charged: Lucas Wilson (left) and Camilla Rose (right), seen after the birth of their younger child in July, have been charged with endangering Wilson's 2-year-old son by letting him smoke marijuana . Dangerous: Wilson, who reported to jail on Friday, told investigators that when they were in the hospital after Samuels gave birth to this newborn, they would sneak out of the room and smoke marijuana outside . Court records say the investigation began in August when Samuels' mother told investigators she found a video on her daughter's phone showing Wilson's son putting a pipe in his mouth. Prosecutors say both Wilson and Samuels told investigators they let the boy smoke marijuana five times since August. Wilson said it would make the boy mellow. Adding to the endangerment of the 2-year-old, Samuels gave birth to their child in July and court documents state that the baby tested positive for marijuana and meth. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports . that the couple were living in a trailer on West Main Street in Bozeman . in 2012 when they discovered that she was pregnant. In . January of 2013, when she was in her second trimester of ther . pregnancy, they began to drink and smoke both meth and marijuana. Infuriating: After their baby was born with traces of meth and marijuana in its system, that didn't stop their drug use and Samuels wrote to a friend that she wanted them to visit the hospital so she could go out and smoke . They did not keep their drug use a secret and were said to regularly smoke in front of the 2-year-old. They moved to Washington state briefly and decided to move back to Montana with the intention of selling meth and marijuana. Their dealing plan didn't work out, however, because they personally consumed all of the drugs before they got back to Montana. As part of a deal that they struck with the 2-year-old, they agreed that he would be allowed to smoke marijuana five times. When . they returned to the state, they lived at Sunrise Campground and that . is when the boy was videotaped smoking from the pipe. Failed plan: Samuels and Wilson began smoking marijuana and meth when they temporarily moved to Washington state when she was in her second trimester. They planed to sell the drugs but ended up smoking them all . In July of last year, Samuels gave birth to their son Malachi Dean Wilson at a Bozeman hospital. She posted a number of photos of the newborn on her Facebook account and even though she wrote to that the baby was 'clean and healthy as can be,' blood tests proved otherwise. Her hospital stay didn't seem to stop her drug habit either: when a friend offers to bring her a soda during an upcoming visit, she responded by writing 'Hey i might go smk then lol [sic]'. Wilson confirmed their drug use to investigators, and he told police that the couple would sneak out of her hospital room and smoke outside the building.","Lucas Wilson has been arrested in Montana and a warrant is out for Camilla Samuels as they both face child endangerment charges .

"An ex-convict who married two women shot them both dead after a row erupted in the house they all shared. Thug Levent Eren Ser, 33, gunned them down at his home in the city of Izmit, north-eastern Turkey, after he caught his first wife Fadime Ser, 20, shouting at second wife Inci Ates, 20, whom he married in an illegal religious ceremony. As the two began arguing Ser pulled out a hunting rifle and gunned them both down before going on the run. Thug Levent Eren Ser (pictured), 33, gunned down both his wives at his home in the city of Izmit . Fadime was taken to hospital where she later died. Ates was killed on the spot. He was caught two hours later hiding in a pine grove not far from the house. Neighbour Omer Tahir, 45, said: 'He was an unpleasant piece of work who thought he was something special. 'He was rude to everyone, especially to his two women, and treated them no better than cows.' Fadime Ser and  Inci Ates (both pictured) were shot dead by their husband, Levent Eren Ser, after they began arguing with each other . Following his arrest a police spokesman said: 'He was previously in jail for wounding a man. This time he'll get life.' The shooting follows a conference in the western city of Istanbul organised to discuss the problem of women who are abused by their husbands. Female activists, public figures and politicians said that women who suffer domestic violence do not have the government's protection and there were only 70 shelters available in the whole of Turkey. The government has now pledged to try and clamp down on domestic violence and to provide women with greater protection.","Levent Eren Ser, 33, gunned down both his wives with a hunting rifle .

"It's a reaction to the Sandy Hook massacre that many will find shocking. But in parts of America they believe the way to prevent a similar school tragedy is to arm the teachers. The theory is that if another gunman targets a school he will face an armed response rather than classrooms full of defenceless staff and children. Scroll down for video . Be prepared: Joanna Baginska, a fourth grade teacher at Odyssey Charter School in American Fork, Utah is shown how to handle a 40 cal. Sig Sauer by firearm instructor Clark Aposhian . Acting on this contentious logic, nearly 200 teachers in Utah volunteered for six hours of firearms training. ‘If we have the ability to stop something, we should do it,’ said primary school teacher Jessica Fiveash, who was learning how to use her 9mm Ruger pistol with a laser sight. She and other teachers were given free training by the Utah Shooting Sports Council in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shootings in Connecticut, in which lone gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults. The basic training emphasised how teachers should show their gun, as well as taking cover, before trying to shoot. The teachers applied for a concealed weapons permit, submitting fingerprints and a mugshot for a criminal background check. Similar moves are happening across America after the National Rifle Association urged placing an armed guard in every school and backed arming teachers. In Ohio, a firearms group said it was launching a scheme in firearms training for 24 teachers and Arizona is proposing a change to the law to allow a teacher in each school to carry a gun. Some parents have questioned the cost of arming and training school staff and also whether it will keep anyone safe. Opponents list potential dangers such as teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and shooting classmates, either accidentally or on purpose. Cori Sorensen, a fourth grade teacher from Highland Elementary School in Highland, Utah, receives firearms training with a .357 magnum from personal defense instructor Jim McCarthy during concealed weapons training for 200 Utah teachers . Clark Aposhian, President of Utah Shooting Sport Council, holds a pistol during the concealed weapons training. The lobby group offered six hours free training . Elementary school teacher Jessica Fiveash, who learned on Thursday how to use a 9 mm Ruger with a laser sight, said: 'If we have the ability to stop something, we should do it.' The moves to train teachers come after the National Rifle Association proposed placing an armed officer at each of the nation's schools, though some schools already have police officers. Parents and educators have questioned how safe the proposal would keep children and whether it would be economically feasible. Around 200 teachers watched intently and made notes as Mr Aposhian demonstrated with a plastic gun during concealed-weapons training offered free in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre . Adam Lanza killed his mother and then went on a rampage through the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself . Some educators say it is dangerous to allow guns on campus. Among the potential dangers they point to are teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and accidentally or purposely shooting classmates. 'It's a terrible idea,' said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education. 'It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.' Kristen Rand, the legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy organisation, said to believe that a 'teacher would be successful in stopping someone who has made the decision to engage in a shootout is just not rationale'. 'No teacher is ever going to be as effective as a trained law enforcement officer,' Ms Rand said. Mr Aposhian demonstrates with a plastic gun, rear, while Joanna Baginska, a 4th grade teacher from Odyssey Charted School, in American Fork, practices with a 40 cal. Sig Sauerr . Christine Caldwell, left, receives firearms training with a 9mm Glock from Mr McCarthy. It is the latest effort to arm teachers to confront school assailants . Even trained police officers don't always hit their targets, and arming teachers could put innocent students at risk of crossfire, she said. Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of deadly shooting that took place in Connecticut. They emphasised the importance of reacting appropriately under pressure. 'We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls looking for an armed intruder', said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun lobby. 'They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter breaks into a classroom.' The group waived its $50 fee for the training. Instruction featured plastic guns and emphasized that people facing deadly threats should announce or show their gun and take cover before trying to shoot. Mr Aposhian says that a gun gives teachers another option if a shooter breaks into a classroom . The teachers listened intently to the lessons. Some claimed they do not see anything wrong with arming educators . They cautioned teachers about the liability that comes with packing a gun in public. 'It's going to be a hassle. It's another responsibility. You can't just leave your gun lying around,' Mr Aposhian said. 'Not for a minute.' The teachers at the basic gun training applied for a concealed-weapons permit, submitting fingerprints and a mug shot for a criminal background check. The class kicked off as an instructor in the 'psychology of mass violence' offered various tactics to disrupt an assailant. The first, the instructor said, was to start with the command: 'Stop right there!' Mr Aposhian, who demonstrated personally using plastic weapons during the six hour session, said that having a gun was a 'responsibility' Stephen Pratt, a third grade teacher from Alpine, Utah, is fingerprinted for a gun carry permit by instructor Mr McCarthy, right . 'I wouldn't hesitate to shoot if the danger was immediate,' said Ms Fiveash, adding that her laser sight would make shooting in tight quarters safer. English teacher Kevin Leatherbarrow said he often felt threatened while working at an inner-city school in Buffalo, New York, where he got a license to carry a pistol. He moved less than a year ago to Utah, where he feels safer. But he said gun violence can break out anywhere. Mr Leatherbarrow said he was highly trained in handling guns - and was taking criticism from parents who don't appreciate his views on school safety. 'I'm in agreement not everybody should be carrying firearms in school. They're not trained. But for some parents to think we're cowboys, that frustrates me,' he said.'I wish parents would understand.' In the US the number of homicides at schools of children, ages 5-18, have been lower year-by-year in the 2000s than they were in the mid- to late-1990s, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report on school crime released in 2012. Mr Aposhian's lobby group waved their normal $50 fee for the training in the wake of the massacre which has rocked America . Carl Stubbs, centre, principal from Valley View Elementary School, in Pleasant Grove looks on with other teachers during the session on Thursday, December 27 in West Valley City, Utah . At 32 deaths, the 2006-2007 school year was the only one that reached the levels from the 1990s. The manner of death was not listed. Utah is among a few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws. Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could, but legislators left them with no choice. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from imposing their own gun restrictions. Educators say they have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate 1 percent of Utah teachers, or 240, are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many do so at school. 'I never felt threatened in 14 years of teaching, but I don't think you can be too prepared,' said Tiffany Parry, a dance teacher in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy who applied for Thursday for a license to carry a concealed gun. 'I think it could come in handy.' The debate about gun control has been . brought to the forefront by the Connecticut tragedy, with the National . Rifle Association's chief executive Wayne LaPierre claiming: 'The only . way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.' Larry Pratt, executive director advocacy group Gun Owners of America, also claimed that gun control supporters ‘have the blood of little children on their hands’ and the tragedy could have been prevented if the teachers were allowed to carry weapons. But politicians and gun-control advocates have reacted angrily to the statements.","Free training session was offered by Utah's leading gun lobby group .

"As rage letters go, they don't come much more furious than the epistle sent to an Australian airline by a passenger seated next to a man as big as 'an infant hippopotamus' and who smelled like 'blue cheese' and a 'Mumbai slum'. Traveller Rich Wisken wrote on a blog that he paid an extra $A25 (£13.50) for an exit row seat, expecting to travel from Perth to Sydney with more room than a normal economy seat. But he found himself seated beside an obese man, leaving him to feel that he was pinned to his seat 'by a fleshy boulder.' Viral: As rage letters go, they don't come much more furious than the epistle sent to an Australian airline by a passenger seated next to a man as big as 'an infant hippopotamus' (file photo) When he tried to change seats, he found those that were empty were taken by passengers who had stretched themselves out to lie in comfort. Mr Wisken returned to his exit row seat and 'it was then I realised that my fate was sealed. 'I made my way back to Jabba the Hutt (the blob creature in Star Wars) and spent the remainder of the flight smothered in side-boob and cellulite, taking shallow breaths to avoid noxious gas poisoning.' It might be gathered by now that Mr Wisken was not at all happy with the four-and-a-half-hour flight and has penned a furious letter to the airline, Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas. Mr Wisken was not at all happy with the four-and-a-half-hour flight and has penned a furious letter to the airline, Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas . What made his ordeal worse was to find that two days later a flight to Melbourne he'd book with the airline was cancelled, as was a rescheduled flight. On his third attempt, the flight was delayed for two hours. On receiving his angry, but humorous, letter of complaint, Jetstar emailed him with an offer of a $A100 (£54) voucher in compensation, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reports today. 'Awesome work, Jetstar!' he wrote. 'Two of my flights in the past two days have been cancelled. You're so lucky that my favourite pastime is wasting both time and money getting to and from airports. 'Imagine how annoyed someone who doesn't LOVE wasting time and money would feel about this situation. Man, I'd hate to be that guy...' Dear Jetstar... Do you like riddles? I do, that's why I'm starting this letter with . one. What weighs more than a Suzuki Swift, less than a Hummer and smells . like the decaying anus of a deceased homeless man? No idea? How about, . what measures food portions in kilograms and has the personal hygiene of . a French prostitute? Still nothing? Right, one more try. What's fat as . f***, stinks like shit and should be forced to purchase two seats on a . Jetstar flight? That's right, it's the man I sat next to under on my . flight from Perth to Sydney yesterday. As . I boarded the plane, I mentally high-fived myself for paying the . additional $25 for an emergency seat. I was imagining all that extra . room, when I was suddenly distracted by what appeared to be an infant . hippopotamus located halfway down the aisle. As I got closer, I was . relieved to see that it wasn't a dangerous semi-aquatic African mammal, . but a morbidly obese human being. However, this relief was short-lived . when I realised that my seat was located somewhere underneath him. Soon . after I managed to burrow into my seat, I caught what was to be the . first of numerous fetid whiffs of body odour. His scent possessed hints . of blue cheese and Mumbai slum, with nuances of sweaty flesh and human . faeces sprayed with cologne - Eau No. Considering I was visibly under . duress, I found it strange that none of the cabin crew offered me . another seat. To be fair, it's entirely possible that none of them . actually saw me. Perhaps this photo will jog their memories. Pinned . to my seat by a fleshy boulder, I started preparing for a 127 . Hours-like escape. Thankfully though, the beast moved slightly to his . left, which allowed me to stand up, walk to the back of the plane and . politely ask the cabin crew to be seated elsewhere. I didn't catch the . names of the three flight attendants, but for the purpose of this . letter, I'll call them: Chatty 1, Chatty 2 and Giggly (I've given them . all the same surname - Couldnotgiveash***). After my request, Chatty 1 . and Chatty 2 continued their conversation, presumably about how s*** . they are at their jobs, and Giggly, well, she just giggled. I then asked . if I could sit in one of the six vacant seats at the back of the . aircraft, to which Giggly responded, ""hehehe, they're for crew only, . hehehe"". I think Giggly may be suffering from some form of mental . impairment. I tried to . relocate myself without the assistance of the Couldnotgiveas*** . triplets, but unfortunately everyone with a row to themselves was now . lying down.

"The White House and the Defense Department denied on Friday multiple reports that an ill-fated attempt to rescue American photojournalist James Foley and other American captives in Syria failed because President Barack Obama took too long to green-light the mission. Retired Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer, a CIA-trained former former U.S. military intelligence officer, told WMAL radio in Washington on Thursday that a Special Forces effort might have succeeded if the president had acted more quickly. 'I'm hearing from my friends in the Pentagon,' Shaffer said during the talk radio stations' morning show. 'They are giving [Obama] every single option way ahead of time.' 'And let me give you a little secret here: The reason that raid into Syria failed to get Foley and those guys was because the president dragged his feet. He waited too long, the intel got stale, and by the time we actually gave the ""go"" word it failed because we just didn't react quick enough.' Scroll down for video . Foley died in a gruesome beheading a month after the US failed to rescue him and other hostages in Syria . The accusation is 'not true,' a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council tweeted Friday. Special Forces, the press officer said, conducted the operation 'as soon as the President & nat sec team were confident it could be carried out successfully.' Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon's press secretary, tweeted that the mission was 'conducted flawlessly' and 'on a timeline that ensured [the] best chance of success. The Pentagon confirmed last week that a summertime mission failed to rescue any hostages because they had been moved prior to American commandos' arrival. The Sunday Times of London reported a similar development earlier this week, also citing Shaffer and another unnamed Defense Department source. 'I'm told it was almost a 30-day delay from when they said they wanted to go to when he finally gave the green light,' Shaffer told the Times. 'They were ready to go in June to grab the guy [Foley] and they weren't permitted.' The Times story quickly went viral via RealClearPolitics. On-the-record denials from two senior Obama administration officials, however, will put the White House in an embarrassing position if the claims are proven to be true. Obama, on the road Friday for Democratic fundraisers, is accused of dithering while ISIS moved its captives in Syria . A second source told the Times that 'the White House constantly goes back and forth on these things.' 'These people are a bunch of academics who endlessly analyse stuff and ordering up another deep-thinking paper but can’t decide what to order for lunch.' Foley's death was broadcast worldwide in a video distributed online by terrorists affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) two weeks ago. In the footage, a masked Islamist militant is seen beginning to decapitate him. The video then cuts to a gruesome image of Foley's head sitting atop the rest of his dead body. Some analysts have suggested that the video was captured long ago, and that Foley has been dead for more than a year. If true, it would also throw the Obama administration's intelligence-gathering capabilities into doubt since it would have been impossible to rescue him a month ago.","Retired military intel colonel says the Pentagon is full of chatter about Obama's indecision and the tie it cost commandos on the ground .

"A formerly obese man has transformed his life after being inspired to get fit by boxer Ricky Hatton. Simon Huyton, 38, a computer programmer from Leigh, Greater Manchester, has lost 10st in just 10 months. At his heaviest, Simon weighed over 25st and struggled to do basic things like walk up the stairs. Changed his ways: Simon dropped from 25st 2lb (left) to 15st (right) by totally revamping his diet and embarking on a fitness regime . He feared for his health as his father had died from an obesity-related illness. Simon explained: 'When I was 14 years old, my father sadly passed away from a heart condition which was related to his weight. 'I could see myself slowly heading in the same direction and I knew something needed to be done.' Simon found inspiration for his weight loss from an unusual place. 'I started following Ricky Hatton on Twitter, who would often post inspirational tweets about his training in preparation for a fight coming up,' he said. 'He was overweight at the time and trying to lose weight. He kept posting funny things like images from the film Run Fat Boy Run and it made me giggle. I started thinking I could do that, I can lose weight.' Due to his size, Simon was too embarrassed to go to the gym so he purchased a press trainer and a monkey gym which he kept in his garage at home. Inspiration: Ricky Hatton gave Simon the push he needed to get in shape after he followed him on Twitter . Fat to fit: Simon has gone from struggling to climb the stairs to an exercise fanatic in under a year . 'I just locked myself away for 10 months really. I gave up drinking and all my unhealthy snacks. 'I used to be a champion at lying still. I work from home and I used to get my shops delivered and sometimes would barely leave the house for weeks. 'Everyday stuff was hard. Even just climbing the stairs I would get sweaty and out of breath. 'I wasn't happy with the way I looked but I wouldn't really admit that to anyone.' Simon decided to drastically change his diet, ditching the highly processed foods he was living off, such as pies, cereal, sandwiches and frozen chips, in favour of more wholesome foods. He now eats a high protein diet with lots of chicken, rice, sweet potatoes and fresh vegetables. As the weight dropped off Simon gained enough confidence to join his local gym and began to gradually increase his exercise. Then and now: Simon says he is the fittest he has ever been, right . Simon now works out most days, only taking a day off when he feels the need to. An average day will see him working out at least twice, doing a variety of different exercises such as swimming in the morning, a weights session at lunch and exercise classes at the gym in the evening. He explains: 'I try and mix up my exercise. I've fallen in love with running outdoors so I do a lot of that. I'm fitter than I've ever been before in my life. ' After losing over 10st, he signed up for the urban obstacle assault course, Men's Health Survival of the Fittest, run by company Rat Race, to help keep him motivated and to give him a target to work towards. Simon said: 'The Survival of the Fittest course was gruelling but great fun and I am very proud to say that I completed it in 1 hour and 23 minutes - so all my hard work and training certainly paid off. Breakfast: Cereal or eggs and bacon, with lots of toast . Lunch: A pie or sandwich or trip to chip shop . Dinner: Frozen meals such as chicken and chips . Snacks: Sweets and several packs of crisps a  day. Lots of fizzy drinks . Breakfast: A protein shake with flax and chia seeds or porridge with a banana . Lunch: Chicken, mashed sweet potato and vegetables . Dinner: An omelette made with chicken and salad . Snacks: Fresh fruit . 'Having an event like this to work towards provided me with the motivation I needed to keep training and it in turn helped me to maintain my weight loss. 'I'm much happier with my body now. I don't think I'll ever be totally happy with myself though, even though a few people say I should be now. 'I spend so long being ridiculously self conscious and I just got used to people looking down on my because I was so over weight. 'I still have work to do on my body but I do realise it will take time and there is no quick fix. 'I really hope that by telling my story I can now inspire others who are in a similar situation to what I was to lead a healthier lifestyle as it is the best thing I ever did'. The next Survival of the Fittest is set to take place in London on the 22nd November which will see Wembley Park transformed into a colossal 10km urban assault course.","Simon Huyton, 38, used to live off a diet of junk food .

"The heavens may have opened but the band kept on playing as the Queen threw her home open for a garden party today. Around 8,000 members of the public, dressed in their summer finery, milled around on the lawn at Buckingham Palace as members of the Royal Family, including the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Earl and the Countess of Wessex and the Duke of Kent, prepared to greet guests. As the royal party, led by the Queen, trooped outside for the National Anthem, however, they were engulfed in a torrent of rain. Looking radiant: The Queen looks up at a grey sky as rain engulfs the garden party at Buckingham Palace today . Ever prepared, the royal puts up her Fulton umbrella as the rain began to fall during the celebrations . The royal, dressed in the same design she wore to the wedding of William and Kate, clasped her coordinating  see-through umbrella as she toured the party - which was attended by 8,000 members of the public . The Queen, who was wearing the same primrose Angela Kelly-designed outfit that she wore to Prince William's wedding, glanced up at the sky, put up her see-through Fulton umbrella and stoically carried on shaking hands. Lulled by earlier sunshine, however, many of those who attended had left their brollies at home, leaving them dripping wet as they exchanged small talk with the sovereign and her family. Richard and Jenny Morton from the Isles of Scilly shared a joke with the Queen about the sudden downpour that left guests sodden. But the husband and wife were left dripping with rain as they kept their umbrella shut until the Queen had moved on to chat to other guests. The royal stoically continued on her official duties this afternoon despite a bout of rainfall . The Queen, pictured making her way to Westminster Abbey, previously wore her sunny yellow outfit for the wedding of William and Kate in 2011 . The Queen pictured wearing the Angela Kelly designed piece on the day of the Royal wedding . Laughing: The Duke of Edinburgh didn't let the poor weather put a dampener on the event - laughing with guests . Relaxed: The Prince of Wales looked relaxed - and dry - as he toured the gardens during the sodden event . Mrs Morton, 59, a teacher from the settlement of Higher Town on the island of St Martin's said: 'This is the first time we've been to London in 40 years. We told the Queen this and she said ""you haven't chosen a very nice day"".' Trish Spiers from Winchester, who had been invited to the annual summer gathering as she was recently awarded the BEM - British Empire Medal - for her community work, also spoke to the Queen. The monarch was particularly interested to hear of her work with the Almshouse of St Cross in Winchester where she had planted a tree some 25 years earlier. Mrs Spiers said she told the Queen that her tree was still going strong. Too tall? The Duchess of Cornwall sported a similar umbrella to the Queen as she tried to shelter a guest . Prince Philip laughed and joked with numerous attendees from the relative safety of his umbrella . It's raining cats and corgis! Prince Philip is pictured watching the crowd from under his large black umbrella . Prince Charles chatted with two party guests - who looked a little damp having forgotten their umbrellas . The Countess of Wessex smiled for the cameras at the annual event . 'She told me she was fascinated to hear that as she often never got to hear what happened to all the trees she planted,' she said. Prince Charles made a beeline for Bruce Jackman, a former Brigadier with the 2nd Gurkhas, whom he met on a official visit to the regiment in Hong Kong in 1980. 'He arrived late at night having just come from the opera in his black tie. He piloted the helicopter himself, landing on the airfield in the pitch black with just our Land Rover headlights to mark the way. It was like something out of a James Bond film, ' he recalled. The royal later chatted with other party-goers - one of whom sported a fashionable red umbrella . Not deterred by a bit of wet weather, Princess Alexandra met with guests at the palace . Thankfully, the rain eventually subsided while a selection of bands continued to play a medley of tunes . He said afterwards: 'We were told he would just go straight to bed but went to the mess, ordered a whisky and talked to every soldier he could. He was so easy-going, charming and genuinely interested in what they were doing. 'He made a beeline for me and said how nice it was to see me again.' After chatting to several hundred of their guests the royal party headed into the royal tea tent as the bands of the Blues and Royals and the Irish Guards continued to play a medley of cheery tunes.","Heavens opened during Queen's garden party at Buckingham Palace .

"Christmas Eve turned tragic in a small New Hampshire town when a volunteer firefighter pulled a dying woman from the wreckage of a car crash - only to realize after she was dead that the victim was his own daughter. Steve Whitcomb was horrified to find his 30-year-old daughter Katie Hamilton, a mother of three, had died on the highway after a crash pushed her SUV into oncoming traffic and she was hit head-on, Brookline Police Chief Bill Quigley revealed Tuesday.

"A Southwest Airlines flight attendant allegedly initially refused to use an automated external defibrillator (AED) on a passenger due to his chest hair. KOAT reported that Jack Jordan, 62, suffered a heart attack on the plane.

Jordan criticized the situation, telling KOAT 'I don't expect the airlines or flight attendants to be nurses or doctors. Not anywhere close. 'But, in that kind of a circumstance, one of the first things that they should be doing is getting that AED hooked up.' 'Caroline says eventually they did shave her husband's chest and put on the device, but he died at [Albuquerque International Sunport],' KOAT reporter Nancy Laflin said in the broadcast. Dr. Barry Ramo told KOAT defibrillator kits have tools to help remove items that get in the way.

After two surgeries to prevent liver failure, her condition continued to worsen and doctors told the family a liver transplant was the only way to keep her alive. Hero dad: Illinois father Eduardo Camargo, pictured, dropped 40 pounds to save his baby daughter, Jazlyn, pictured left . Diagnosis: Eduardo Camargo's little girl Jazlyn was diagnosed with biliary atresia - a condition that occurs when the liver's bile duct is blocked or absent - soon after she was born in April 2012 . 'Right away I said it had to be me and not my wife,' Camargo told ABC News. 'I have two other daughters and they need a mother more than they need a father.' But doctors told the 210-pound Camargo he had what's called fatty liver disease and couldn't be a donor until he trimmed down. 'We . use no more than 10 percent fat tissue in the liver as our cutoff for . donors and unfortunately the father was certainly higher than that,' Dr. Talia Baker, a liver transplant specialist at North Western Memorial . Hospital, told ABC. Camargo said he hadn't exercised since high school and struggled but was determined to get in shape for his daughter. Only hope: After two surgeries to prevent liver failure, her condition continued to worsen and doctors told the family a liver transplant was the only way to keep her alive . Volunteered: 'Right away I said it had to be me and not my wife,' Camargo told ABC News. 'I have two other daughters and they need a mother more than they need a father' As well as working out, he cut his portion sizes, ate more vegetables and drank nothing but water.He said the running was hardest. 'There . were days when I thought my knees would give out and all I wanted to do . was stop, but I would think of my daughter and I would keep going,' he . said. 'After a while I worked my way up to 6 miles in an hour.' But his hard work paid off and in . less than two months he had slimmed down to 180 pounds and lowered the . percentage of fat in his liver to below 2 per cent, enough to move . forward with the transplant. And it was just in time. Overweight; But doctors told the 210-pound Camargo he had what's called fatty liver disease and couldn't be a donor until he trimmed down . Healthy: Camargo said he hadn't exercised since high school and struggled but was determined to get in shape for his daughter . A day before the surgery was scheduled, Jazlyn's live began to fail. Doctors removed about a third of Camargo's liver and it was put on ice and walked across the street to the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago where surgeons were waiting to transplant it into Jazlyn. And both surgeries were a resounding success, Baker told ABC News, with Jazlyn cured and her father suffering no side effects from the transplant. 'The liver is the one organ that begins regenerating immediately after donor surgery,' she said. 'After about 3 months the majority of the donor's liver tissue is restored.' Now, a year later, Camargo is thrilled to be celebrating the holidays with a happy and healthy 20-month-old. 'Last year at this time, me and my wife were going back and forth from the hospital to visiting my kids, who were at home with my parents,' Camrgo told the Chicago Sun-Times. 'My heart was broken. It was really hard, because you want to have everyone together but you can't. This year, we're actually all together, so it feels really good. It feels really good.' He 35-year-old added of organ donation: 'It's a scary experience going through it but the outcome pays off. When you see your child running up and down, you know something good came out of it.'","Eduardo Camargo's little girl Jazlyn was diagnosed with biliary atresia - when the liver's bile duct is blocked or absent - after her April 2012 birth .

"Gordon Ramsay is embroiled in a High Court row claiming he should not be held personally responsible for the £640,000-a-year rent of his London pub and restaurant. The chef, who took on a 25-year-lease of the York and Albany in 2007, claims his signature as a personal guarantee for the pub's rent was forged using an automatic machine without his permission. Mr Ramsay acquired the property while his father-in-law, Christopher Hutcheson, was still at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings before leaving in 2010 after he was accused  of plundering more than £1million from the company. Scroll down for video . Gordon and Tana Ramsay arriving at the High Court, where it was claimed Mrs Ramsay's father used a machine to forge her husband's signature to become personal guarantee for the York and Albany pub . The celebrity chef, pictured left leaving court with his wife, is in a dispute with film director Gary Love, right . Following a lengthy legal dispute, he was reportedly given around £2million in a settlement and severed ties with the company. Afterwards Mr Ramsay's lawyers discovered for the first time that the TV personality was personally guaranteeing the rent on the York and Albany in Regent's Park, the court heard today. Mr Ramsay claims he never agreed to this and that his father-in-law used a Ghost Writer - a machine which reproduced Mr Ramsay's handwriting - to forge his signature. Today he told of his 'shock and horror' that he believed his father-in-law had forged his signature, adding his 'deep and extensive trust in Hutcheson was entirely misplaced', and that he had defrauded him and the group 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'. The chef claims the machine had been acquired 'for purposes of merchandising only'. The owner of the pub, film director Gary Love, dismissed his allegations as 'absurd' and accused the chef of trying to wriggle out of his rental commitments. In 2007, Gordon Ramsay Holdings won a bidding war to secure a 25-year lease on the 160-year old building, while Mr Hutcheson was CEO of the company. Christopher Hutcheson, left, is accused of using the Ghost Writer machine to forge his son-in-law's signature on 'various contracts' while at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings . It has since been turned it into an upmarket pub, restaurant and hotel, with rooms starting at £150. In 2010 Mr Hutcheson left his position in the company amid reports that he had a 'fiery relationship' with Mr Ramsay. It was later claimed in court the former manager had breached terms of his confidentiality contract to access private emails and plunder more than £1million from the TV chef's empire. He was accused of writing himself 'five-figure cheques', and involving Mr Ramsay's siblings-in-law in the schemes. In 2012 their dispute was settled, with Mr Ramsay's wife, Tana, thought to have severed all ties with her family. The latest legal row comes as Mr Ramsay's lawyers were 'piecing back together' what remains of his business following his father-in-law's departure, the court heard. Following their dispute in 2010, Mrs Ramsay (left) is thought to have severed ties with her father (pictured right with her mother, Greta) Mr Ramsay acquired the York and Albany in 2007 after winning a bidding war for a lease on the 160-year-old building. It is now an upmarket pub, restaurant and hotel in north west London's Regent's Park . Giving evidence, Mr Ramsay said that between six and nine months after Mr Hutcheson was 'removed from the business' in 2010, 'it was discovered then that the lease was signed by the ghost machine'. He said it was discovered that 'there were several documents that had been forged'. Cross-examined by Romie Tager QC, for Mr Love, the chef said he could not remember exactly which documents had been forged, adding he and his wife were then 'going through a very difficult time', telling the court that 'there were several emails that were hacked so it is hard to categorise exactly when and what we discovered'. He said his father-in-law 'never had permission' to sign any deal 'via a ghost machine'. Mr Hutcheson is accused of using the Ghost Writer machine to sign 'various contracts' in his son-in-law's name without his knowledge during his time at the company. The case continues.","Gordon Ramsay sacked father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson as CEO of his company in 2010 .

"Tired of throwing money at ketchup cleaning method expensive cleaning products and worried about the effects of chemicals on your family home? Well, the latest internet craze is to do housework using food from your kitchen. Amanda Cable pulls on her Marigolds, opens her larder and tests just how dirt-busting the edible cleaners can be... CLEAN RUSTY METAL WITH A POTATO . HOW DOES IT WORK? Cut a potato in half, dip the cut end into a flat dish of table salt and rub it all over the rusted areas of metal pans. If the potato becomes too soft, cut it again and apply more salt. Scroll down for video . Old wives' tale works: Amanda found rubbing half a potato on her car did get rid of some rust . The oxalic acid in the potato helps to dissolve the rust by reacting with the iron in the metal to form ferric oxalate, which in turn dissolves in water (or, in this case, the creamy potato starch). The abrasive power of the salt helps remove the residue from the surface. Oxalic acid is found in many household cleaning products. VERDICT: My grandmother always insisted that potatoes could clean her pots and pans but I thought it was an old wives' tale. I have rust at the bottom of my favourite milk pan, which I'd normally tackle with an eye-watering chemical spray. Can a simple potato cut through the rust better? Incredibly, yes. The potato's creamy starch oozes out but the salt sticks to the rust. After five minutes of hard scrubbing, the worst has come away. I go outside and try the other half of the potato on my rusting 20-year-old Mercedes. The neighbours see me rubbing a potato on my car and decide I'm mad. But large chunks of orange rust come away, so who am I to care? 4/5 . GOODBYE TO GREASE WITH A GRAPEFRUIT . HOW DOES IT WORK? Cut a grapefruit in half, dip the cut end into salt, and scrub the bottom of your greasy oven. You can also use it on dirt-encrusted oven trays — and the inside of your bath. Grapefruits contain natural chemicals called furocoumarins, which attack bacteria and act as disinfectants. In fact, many commercial cleaning products contain grapefruit extract for its cleaning power and fresh smell. VERDICT: I can't stand the bitter taste of grapefruit — but the smell of oven cleaner makes me feel just as sick. I buy a large grapefruit, dip it into salt and scrub the greasy inside of my cooker. Layers of thick, black grease are instantly lifted, and my oven grills go from black to shiny silver. But the best thing is the smell. My stinking oven is like the inside of a Jo Malone shop. I'll never buy oven cleaner again! 5/5 . WHITE BREAD TO DUST PAINTINGS . HOW DOES IT WORK? White bread is highly absorbent so attracts other matter such as dust and grime. But the yeast, flour and water inside the bread leaves no residue — so your beloved pictures are safe if you use a slice as a duster. Dab it over the surface to pick up the dirt. VERDICT: I was once advised to use white bread to pick up shards of broken glass, and it worked brilliantly. But I'm dubious about wiping my favourite painting, which has pride of place in the living room, with a slice of white Hovis. As I very gingerly move it over the painting, the white bread turns satisfyingly grey. It's so effective, I even use it to scoop up an old spiders' web. 4/5 . Best thing since sliced bread: It works as a duster too . SPRUCE UP WINDOWS WITH ONIONS . HOW DOES IT WORK? Chop an onion into four and place the pieces in a bucket of warm water. Leave for at least half an hour, so the onion juices can infuse into the water, before removing the onion. The liquid will apparently make your windows sparkle without streaks. When onions are chopped, the juices release organsulfur, a disinfectant cleaner that attacks microscopic biological germs. Organsulfur is often used industrially in solvent cleaners. VERDICT: I can't go near an onion without crying, so when my husband arrives home to find me weeping by the window, he fears something terrible has happened. Onions are great natural cleaners but they've never been widely used for cleaning because of the smell. Mine might have removed hidden germs but the glass is smeared and the stench is unbearable. 0/5 . GET GLEAMING PANS WITH KETCHUP . HOW DOES IT WORK? Rub a thin layer of ketchup on the surface of dull or tarnished copper and stainless-steel pans. Leave for 30 minutes. The acetic acid (a weak organic chemical that gives condiments a bitter taste) in the vinegar in the ketchup will react with the tarnish and remove it. Copper pans tarnish because the copper combines with oxygen in the air to form copper oxide, which is brown. The acetic acid attacks the copper oxide, dissolving the brown layer. This can then be wiped off with a soft cloth. Stainless-steel pans often contain an inner core of copper sandwiched between the layers of steel on the bottom of the pan, to increase heat conductivity. This tarnishes in the same way as pure copper and can also be cleaned with ketchup. Result! Amanda was amazed at how well ketchup cleaned her dirty pans . VERDICT: When I wipe the ketchup off my copper saucepan, it looks shiny and new. The water stains and dark deposits on the bottom have gone. It's as if I've waved a magic wand. Amazing. 5/5 . Polished: Vinegar worked a treat on the shower . VINEGAR SHINES YOUR SHOWER . HOW DOES IT WORK? Mix pure white vinegar with an equal amount of water and pour it in a spray bottle. Then spray on to the surface and wipe off. The acetic acid inside vinegar has been used as an anti-bacterial agent since Egyptian times. When dissolved in water, it breaks down into hydrogen and acetate, both of which weaken stains. However, you must only ever use white vinegar or distilled white vinegar because these contain just 5 per cent acetic acid, which won't damage your surfaces. Do not use on stone finishes (such as granite and marble), iron, stainless steel, bronze or copper, as the acid can damage them. And never mix the vinegar with bleach or alcohol, as it will become corrosive. VERDICT: I spend a fortune on expensive glass-cleaning products, so I am really hoping this will work. I spray the vinegar mix on my glass shower screen, wipe with a soft cloth — and the glass is shiny and smear-free. But my bathroom smells like a fish and chip shop. I find an online tip to peel an orange and soak the vinegar in a bottle with the peel for three days before use. This works - it smells of sweet oranges and does a great job on my tiles, too. 4/5 . USE BANANA SKINS TO POLISH SHOES . HOW DOES IT WORK? If your leather shoes are looking scuffed and dull, rub them with the inside of a banana peel, as it contains atoms of nitrogen, sulphur and carboxylic acids, which act as natural cleaning agents. Wipe away the remaining banana residue and buff with a soft cloth for a glossy sheen. The potassium in bananas is a key ingredient used in commercial shoe polishes. It absorbs into leather and helps diminish scuff marks. VERDICT: As I rub a banana skin over my husband's favourite brown leather shoes, I start to panic. The gunk is making them look utterly revolting! I grab a cloth and scrub away, and thank goodness the smeary banana residue disappears. It has cleaned the shoes but traditional polish does a far smarter job. Later, my husband asks me why his shoes smell of banana. He is not impressed. 1/5 . Sticky problem: The sugar attracts bacteria so it's not worth it to remove lime scale . COLA FOR THE LOO . HOW DOES IT WORK? Everyone's heard the myth about what happens to false teeth if you leave them overnight in a cup of cola. Well, it's the same principle if you use the fizzy drink on the limescale inside your toilet bowl. It's all thanks to the phosphoric acid in the cola and the carbonic acid in the carbon dioxide (which creates the bubbles). Pour a one-litre bottle into the bowl and around the rim. Leave it for at least an hour or, better still, overnight. Most of the limescale and dirt should have been dissolved and will disappear when you flush — although you may need a brush to work on more stubborn stains. VERDICT: My son Charlie comes home from school just in time to see me pour a bottle of Coke down the toilet. He's terribly upset to see me 'banning' fizzy drinks so dramatically - and only slightly mollified when I tell him I am trying an alternative to bleach. The inside of the bowl turns a horrible dark brown. Three hours later, I flush, and the slightly tarnished limescale marks on the inside bowl have gone. It seems the perfect solution until the whole family complain they are 'sticking' to the toilet seat. Yes, cola is sticky - and the sugar residue also attracts bacteria. I think I'll stick to bleach. 1/5 .","Latest internet craze is to do housework using food from your kitchen .

"Wedding trends: New York wedding planner Fallon Carter has predicted the 10 trends that will come over from the US this year . At one time all a bride-to-be needed was something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue. But nowadays it seems they want a hint of American influence when it comes to planning their wedding. Far from the bog-standard finger buffets, couples are now looking for more adventurous ways to entertain their reception guests, inspired by celebrity ceremonies across the pond. And from receptions with temporary tattoo stations and food trucks to upside-down tiered cakes for dessert, New York wedding planner Fallon Carter has predicted the 10 trends that will come over from the US this year. They range from the traditional, including the return of the veil, as worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé, to the quirky and modern, such as personal branded invites featuring Twitter hashtags. For those on a tight budget, Miss Carter recommended the ‘cocktail reception’, which avoids the cost of a sit-down dinner, or mini pies instead of a cake, which might end up going to waste. She also said she expects to see a rise in clients asking for a ‘man caves’ where the groom and his male guest can retire, or temporary tattoo stations for the young at heart. An upside-down chandelier cake can provide a talking point for guests at dinner, while food trucks on the lawn will be popular among grazers. And Miss Carter said there will be a surge in aerial photography being used to capture the big day from a helicopter. You & Your Wedding is on sale now . The rise in alternative wedding trends follows American celebrity ceremonies which have strayed from the traditional. When Britney Spears married Kevin Federline, she gave her bridesmaids Juicy Couture tracksuits as gifts, while guests at Nicole Ritchie’s wedding included a live elephant. According to Miss Carter, British weddings will start to feature more and more American twists. And her predictions for this year’s top trends feature in the latest edition of You & Your Wedding magazine. Last night the magazine’s editor-in-chief, Maxine Briggs, said: ‘The US wedding industry is worth a reported $51 billion, so it’s no big surprise the Americans lead the way when it comes to big-day innovations. 'We’ve seen US traditions like bridesmaids walking down the aisle first and rehearsal dinners steadily becoming more popular here. 'Now UK brides are branching out from British traditions in their reception décor and food too, opting for the more personalised and elaborate ideas they’ve seen their American counterparts showcasing - often inspired by big-budget or A-list celebrations stateside.’ The trends range from the traditional, including the return of the veil, as worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, to the quirky and modern . 1. The Chandelier Cake: A tiered cake turned upside down. Miss Carter said: ‘I recently worked with Haute So Sweet bakery to create one – it took a lot of weighing, measuring and praying, but it was worth it. It definitely gets guests talking. 2. The return of the Veil: As seen on the Duchess of Cambridge, Kim Kardashian and Beyoncé . Miss Carter said: ‘I recommend that every bride try one on. This is the only time you’ll be able to wear one, so at least give it a go before saying no.’ 3. Cocktail receptions: The alternative to a sit-down dinner, to be served with canapé-style bites . Miss Carter said: ‘It’s a great way to save money. Communicate with your guests that a full meal won’t be served and have fun with your catering.’ 4. The alternative cake: Serve mini pies, cookies or cobblers instead of a traditional wedding cake . Miss Carter said: ‘Cake often goes to waste as guests are usually dancing and forget to eat their slice. This is more economical and less wasteful. Ensure you have at least two options per guest.’ 5. Floral wristlets: Instead of a traditional bouquet . Miss Carter said: ‘Celebrity event planner Diann Valentine created these bouquet-alternatives for her reality TV star brides and I’ve worked with florist Nicosia Perry to create orchid wristlets. Use sturdy flowers and bold colours.’ 6. Temporary tattoos: As an unusual take on a wedding favour . Miss Carter said: ‘Somehow temporary tattoos will never get old. Include a sponge, spray bottle of water, handheld mirror and application instructions.’ 7. Man caves: Give the groom something to do by letting him arrange a male-only area for smoking cigars and drinking bourbon. Miss Carter said: ‘Having different areas under one roof keeps the party interesting. If you aren’t into whiskey consider a vodka bar with an ice sculpture, or a decadent dessert room.’ 8. Personal branding: Save the dates and invitations with a twist . Miss Carter said: ‘Think social media hashtags, a custom monogram or logo and even symbols, colours and motifs that are used everywhere for a cohesive décor scheme.’ 9. Food trucks: Keep guests satisfied all night and helps prevent drunkenness . Miss Carter said: ‘In America, the hot options are Mister Softee ice cream trucks and delicacies like truffle fries and mini mac’n’cheese, but the possibilities are endless.’ 10. Aerial photography: Capturing the day from a helicopter . Miss Carter: ‘It’s still very new, but I see this being a big trend, especially for destination weddings, where there’s a lot to be seen from above.’","Wedding planner Fallon Carter predicts 10 trends to come over from the US .

"The powerful House Ways and Means Committee will get everything from disgraced former IRS official Lois Lerner's email account since a few weeks before Barack Obama became president. And Republican committee members are hoping they'll find a smoking gun tying the Obama administration to the years-long scheme to play political favorites with nonprofit groups' tax-exemption applications. After eight months of back-and-forth stonewalling, the IRS has agreed to turn over the complete contents of Lerner's email account, along with other documents that two congressional committees have been demanding. 'If there's not a Holy Grail email in this round of documents,' a senior staffer to a Ways and Means committee member told MailOnline, 'then we're not going to find it.' 'Whether that's because Lerner covered her tracks or because the IRS is shredding documents, we're probably never going to know.' Lerner left the IRS after she was implicated in a scheme to target tea party groups for their political beliefs . House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp has pulled off an investigative coup, squeezing documents out of the IRS that could explain the targeting program . The committee's chairman, Michigan Republican Rep. Dave Camp, seems eager to put his staff to work sifting through thousands of messages in search of an explanation for the program that has been a major embarrassment to the White House. 'This is a significant step forward and will help us complete our investigation into the IRS’s targeting of conservative groups,' Camp said Friday. 'From the few Lerner documents we have received, we know that Washington, DC orchestrated the targeting of groups applying for tax-exempt status, surveillance of existing tax-exempt groups and formed the proposed 501(c)(4) rules designed to push conservative groups out of the public forum.' Camp warned the IRS in a February 24 letter that he would start issuing subpoenas if the agency didn't turn over the documents he wanted. The IRS has proposed a rewrite of its regulations governing communications restrictions on 'public benefit' organizations that are exempt from paying federal income taxes. That redesign of the rules began long before Lerner herself exposed the IRS's pattern of holding up right-wing groups' applications, often with dozens of intrusive questions over several years. The effects of the agency's desired rule change would be substantial: Organizations would be prohibited from emailing information, or publishing anything online, about candidates' voting records during the last 60 days before an election. Tea party groups, which began their rise to prominence five years ago, comprised most of the organizations that the IRS targeted beginning in 2010. Their political free-speech concerns have driven more than 146,000 public comments to the IRS, demanding that the regulatory revisions be scrapped. Tea partiers have vented their frustration at President Obama, suggesting that he directed America's taxing authority to erect roadblocks to slow down his political opponents . Under potential new ITS regulations Tea party favorites like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a lawyer warned Friday during the Conservative Political Action Conference, could be banned from national gatherings before elections if the events were hosted by tax-exempt groups . Cleta Mitchell, a board member of the American Conservative Union Foundation, said Friday during that organization's annual Conservative Political Action Conference that the new rules would affect the event where she was speaking. 'It would mean that in even-numbered years, CPAC could have no speakers who are candidates for office,' she said, dumbfounded. Mitchell, an attorney, is representing some of the tea party groups in lawsuits related to the IRS targeting scheme. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa has hauled Lerner in for testimony twice but she has pleaded the Fifth Amendment both times . The House Oversight Committee, chaired by California Rep. Darrell Issa, has cast a larger public shadow than Ways and Means has on the IRS targeting scandal. Lerner has appeared before Issa-led hearings twice, both times invoking her Fifth Amendment rights and refusing to testify, despite President Obama's insistence in a February interview that the IRS displayed 'not a smidgen of corruption' in the damaging episode. Becca Glover Watkins, the Oversight Committee's communications director, told MailOnline that Issa's and Camp's committee staffers are working hand-in-hand. 'The Oversight Committee and the Ways and Means Committee have worked in partnership during the course of this investigation,' Watkins said. 'We expect the IRS will also be delivering a copy [of the complete Lerner files] to the Oversight Committee.' A spokesperson for the Ways and Means Committee told MailOnline that it was the new IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, who broke the inertia after months of requests. 'We have been asking for the materials for months, and after many discussions the new IRS Commissioner has said the IRS will comply with the request,' said the committee's Sarah Swinehart. Lerner 'was clearly at the center of the IRS targeting and was running it out of the Washington, D.C. office,' she added. 'We expect her documents to provide a fuller picture of this.' Koskinen took over the tax agency on December 23, ending a 13-month period during which two interim commissioners served as caretakers. The IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Lois Lerner was hurried out of the IRS after her role was exposed in a program that targeted conservative tax-exemption applicant groups .
The Ways and Means Committee demanded all of her emails eight months ago .
The IRS responded with a limited set of documents, claiming it had searched Lerner's emails for relevant keywords .
Now the tax-collection agency is rewriting its rules to dramatically restrict the political communication of tax-exempt groups .
That policy shift would mostly affect conservative organizations ."
"Jellyfish, a common summertime nuisance, may be more dangerous than once thought. The sea creatures have been around for half a billion years - and new information alleges that they are growing in numbers, killing people and wreaking havoc in the oceans. Lisa-ann Gershwin's book 'Stung! On Jellyfish and the Future of the Oceans,' describes the danger jellyfish pose and how they have overrun various ecosystems. Much of the species' success, she says is based on their life cycle. 'Hermaphroditism. Cloning. External fertilization. Self fertilization. Courtship and copulation. Fission. Fusion. Cannibalism. You name it, jellyfish [are] ""doing it,""' she says. Jellyfish, like the ones seen in this file photo, are growing in numbers, even as other species die and are wiped out . One jellyfish, the Mnemiopsis, is able to lay eggs when it is just 13 days old without needing a mate. It soon is able to lay 10,000 eggs per day. It also can eat over ten times its own body weight in food and can double in size each day. Other jellyfish are extremely difficult to kill. When faced with death, some can 'de-grow' - which means that 'they reduce in size, but their bodies remain in proportion,' the New York Review of Books says. Another species, the zombie jelly, is seemingly immortal. When its particles disintegrate, cells escape and form an entirely new jelly. This period of growth happens within five days. Jellyfish have been strengthening their numbers and now appear at beaches all over the world, like in this file photo . Complex ecosystems, Gershwin says, at what have kept the jellyfish at bay. However, she claims that human involvement and manipulation have catapulted their growth and helped their numbers to explode. Gershwin claims that overfishing anchovies, which compete with jellyfish for food, have created swarms of the sea creatures in South Africa. Jellyfish competitors quickly die out, leaving a 'stingy-slimy killing field,' she says. Plastic bags and drift lines may also destroy the few natural jellyfish predators, like sea turtles. Jellyfish also use hard litter, like industrial waste, to form expansive nurseries. Rising acid and carbon dioxide levels have been noted to kill off many fish species. Jellyfish, however, reportedly thrive in these harsh environments. They release waste with high carbon levels -- which bacteria use to create 'carbon dioxide factories,' Gershwin says. One example is the Gulf of Mexico -- in 2000, jellyfish took over an area of sixty square miles. They survived the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 oil spill, when thousands of other species died. Jellyfish have thrived in the harsh Gulf of Mexico, as seen in this undated file photo, while thousands of other species have died . These combined factors, she says, are what have allowed jellyfish to take over 'one bite at a time.''[There will be] no coral reefs teeming with life. No more mighty whales or wobbling penguins. No lobsters or oysters,' Gershwin says. Jellyfish, like both the box jelly and Irukandji species, have taken dozens of lives. Box jellies can kill within two minutes, the New York Review of Books reports. Irukandji, which can cause extreme cramps, spasms, and vomiting, have taken countless victims. Many deaths are misdiagnosed as strokes and heart attacks. In groups, jellyfish 'have an uncanny knack for getting stuck,' Gershwin writes. They can get sucked in and latch on to heavy structures. In July 2006, jellyfish were sucked into the US Ronald Reagan, wiping out onboard capabilities. Japanese power plants have been 'under attack' from jellyfish since the 1960s, claims the New York Review of Books. The damage may be permanent, Gershwin says. 'I think I underestimated how severely we have damaged our oceans and their inhabitants. I now think that we have pushed them too far [...] without us knowing the precise moment it all became irreversible.' Jellyfish, like the Japanese Sea Nettles seen in this file photo, beat their competitors for food and thrive in carbon-heavy environments .","With bacteria they can form 'carbon dioxide factories' and destroy oceans .

"Carole and Michael Middleton set off for their annual holiday to Mustique early on Sunday morning. The couple are joining their pregnant daughter, the Duchess of Cambridge, her husband, Prince William and their son Prince George on the island - as well as Pippa and James - to celebrate Carole's 60th birthday on January 31. Carole defied her years in a trendy outfit wearing skinny jeans, a black top and blazer and flat boots for the flight departing Gatwick airport today. Michael, meanwhile, looked more formal in beige chinos, a blazer and shirt and jumper combo. Scroll down for video . Carole and Michael Middleton were spotted heading off on their annual holiday to Mustique on Sunday morning. The couple are joining their pregnant daughter, the . Duchess of Cambridge, her husband, Prince William, Prince George, as well as Pippa and James on the luxury island . The family, including Pippa and James Middleton, are holidaying in the tropical luxury of Mustique to celebrate  Carole  birthday at a £10,000-a-week villa. Prince George was accompanied by his aunt and uncle, Pippa and James, as he made the 4,287-mile trip this week on a British Airways flight, albeit in first-class seats. According to fellow travellers he was ‘impeccably behaved’, entertaining himself with soft toys on the nine-hour flight. The family, pictured setting off today, are holidaying in the tropical luxury  to celebrate Carole's 60th birthday at a £10,000-a-week villa . The family group then disembarked in St Lucia before hoping onto a private plane which flew them to the island. Carole and Michael apparently prefer to fly BA as they are still able to obtain a staff discount. Mr Middleton was for many years an aircraft dispatcher with the firm while his wife was a stewardess. It is understood that the family – accompanied by a team of Scotland Yard bodyguards – have taken over Villa Rocina. Carole looked casual today in skinny jeans, a black top and blazer and flat boots as she carried her case .

Carol was bang-on-trend, as always, while Michael looked more formal in chinos and a blazer at the terminal . Designed and built in 1971 in the style of a Caribbean plantation, it boasts its own 30ft pool as well as stunning views. Guests have only to walk a few feet from their garden to snorkel in the crystal-clear Caribbean Sea in front of the house. Each bedroom has its own en-suite bath and dressing room, and the property has an air-conditioned gym for guests who can tear themselves away from the sun and sand. Four members of staff – a chef, a butler, a housekeeper and a gardener – will be on hand throughout the family’s stay to tend to their every whim. And there is a spa nearby, for anyone finding themselves in need of extra pampering before the party on January 31.

Family: This year's trip has seen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travel as a family with their son . Exclusive: The beautiful island of Mustique is a popular spot for the jetset and is privately owned . With its sugar-sand beaches and gently swaying palms, it's no surprise that the Caribbean has proved a hit with holidaying royalty. A particular favourite is St Barts, which earlier this year saw Princess Beatrice arrive on its shores for a break. Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia. ‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' says MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon. Home: Another royal to love the island was Princess Margaret who owned a home there . While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot. ‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere.' Almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of Mustique, which in January last year, was the scene of Prince George's first ever trip abroad. While the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his Middleton relatives and will do so again this year, his great aunt Princess Margaret, another royal fond of a Mustique break, sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island. Although he is not yet two, Prince George has already travelled to Australia and New Zealand on tour, and taken several private jets to Scotland. He also flew to Mustique last year without his father, who was studying at Cambridge University. This year Prince William is meant to be revising for exams to become an air ambulance pilot but seems to have taken some time out. Famed for its pristine beaches and upmarket watering holes, the island is one of the most exclusive destinations in the world. It became famous in the 1960s when its owner, Lord Glenconner, gave Princess Margaret a ten-acre plot of land as a wedding present. Paparazzi are banned – making Mustique a magnet for celebrities including Mick Jagger and David Bowie.","Carole and Michael jetted off to Mustique on Sunday morning .

"Emad Karakrah, 49, was charged after fleeing police in Chicago on Wednesday . A man has been arrested after leading a police chase through Chicago while allegedly flying the flag of Islamic extremist group ISIS  from his car. Emad Karakrah, 49, also allegedly threatened to bomb police when he was pulled over on Wednesday. Police approached the driver after 911 reports of a 'suspicious person' in a silver car shortly after 9am. He refused to stop and patrol cars were forced to chase him through the city as he ran red lights. When he was finally apprehended, Karakrah told police he would detonate a bomb he had in his car, according to a police report seen by NBC. The threat led to the bomb squad, FBI and Homeland Security being called but after extensive searches, no explosives were discovered. He has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for making a false bomb threat and aggravated fleeing and a misdemeanor count of driving on a never-issued license. The 49-year-old appeared in court and was held on $55,000 bond on Thursday. He is due back in court on September 3. The incident is another troubling example of the alleged creeping presence of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham) in Chicago, a city which terrorists have reportedly made a target because it is 'Obama Town'. Last week, the FBI and Homeland Security warned police forces across the country to be on the lookout for threats as a chilling note was posted online warning that Chicago could be an ISIS target. Scroll down for video . An ISIS miiltant flies the flag for the extremist group in Syria in June. A 49-year-old man is facing charges in Chicago for driving through the city on Wednesday with the same flag . According to ABC, the bulletin read: 'Because of the individualized nature of the radicalization process – it is difficult to predict triggers that will contribute to [homegrown violent extremists] attempting acts of violence.' Chicago in particular has become a prime target because extremist groups think of it as 'Obama Town', a security expert told CBS. A tweet, posted on June 20, has been discovered, showing pictures of the Old Republic Building in Chicago and the White House with a message reportedly from the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL). It reads: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere.' A chilling note was posted on Twitter on June 20 purportedly from someone with a connection to extremist group ISIS. It featured a picture of the White House and the Old Republic Building in Chicago (left) The message, reportedly from ISIS, read: 'We are in your state/We are in your cities/We are in your streets/You are our goals anywhere' President Obama admitted on Thursday that his administration were yet to come up with a plan to defeat ISIS as the group continued its brutal rampage across Iraq and Syria. 'I don't want to put the cart before the horse,' Obama said at the White House. 'We don't have a strategy yet.' His remarks came as the Islamic State released another chilling decapitation video, threatening America and urging the Kurds to break from their alliance with the West against the caliphate. Just hours after the extremists released shocking footage of the mass execution of 300 Syrian national army soldiers in the Syrian desert, ISIS issued a second warning to the U.S. The grainy video, accompanied by the hashtag '2ndAmessagetoAmerica', shows the vicious beheading of a Kurdish soldier, who was part of a group of 15 fighters likely to have been captured by Islamic State during the fighting in Iraq. The group's first warning ten days ago was entitled 'A Message to America' and showed the decapitation of American journalist James Foley.","Emad Karakrah, 49, threatened to detonate a bomb when pulled over by Chicago police on Wednesday for flying an ISIS flag from his car window .

"Tax cut: Prince Charles has benefited from the new 45p tax rate for top earners, despite his income going up . Prince Charles has benefited from the new 45p tax rate for top earners – paying less to the Inland Revenue despite his income going up. Last year the heir to the throne saw his ‘pay packet’ from the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate which provides funding for the Prince of Wales, rise by £500,000. But, according to accounts released yesterday, in 2013/2014 he paid £4.1million in tax – a fall of almost £250,000 on his previous bill. His private secretary, William Nye, said: ‘He has benefited from the 45 per cent tax rate.’ Charles has voluntarily paid income tax on his earnings for more than 20 years. Last year, Charles’s total income and funding, which includes money from taxpayers towards travel on official duties, went up by 7.3 per cent to £21,678,000. The prince’s official expenditure last year was £12.1million. He also used £2.1million of his income from the Duchy on his personal expenditure – down by £250,000 on the previous year – which covers everything from the cost of his food and wife Camilla’s dresses to supporting his two sons. The 50p tax rate for high earners, which is claimed to have brought unprecedented levels of tax avoidance with minimal gain, was slashed by George Osborne in his April 2012 budget and brought in last April. At the time it was said the cut would affect 328,000 top earners with incomes above £150,000 a year. Only yesterday was it confirmed that the future king was one of them. A Clarence House spokesman told the Mail last night: ‘The prince has voluntarily paid income tax for more than 20 years. He pays whatever rate the Government sets. ‘He then chooses to spend well over half of his income after tax in support of his official and charitable work.’ Unfortunately for Charles, Labour has vowed to re-introduce the 50p top . rate if it wins the next election. Ed Miliband has repeatedly branded . the decision to cut the rate from 50p to 45p as a ‘tax cut for . millionaires’. While the prince has been lauded for his . decision pay income tax voluntarily, questions have frequently been . raised about the amount of expenditure he has been able to write-off as . taxable expenses on official duties – which amounted to more than . £10million last year. The prince and Camilla conducted 665 official engagements and . entertained 9,493 guests, while staff costs were £6.2m and £326,000 was . spent on official entertaining and receptions . Yesterday’s accounts, released, . unusually, on the same day as those of the Queen, also revealed that . Charles employed 127.6 (including part-time) staff, including 1.3 . butlers and three chauffeurs as well as 2.5 valets and dressers. He and his family – including Camilla, William, Kate and Harry – received 74,961 and Charles himself wrote 1,959 personally. The . prince and Camilla conducted 665 official engagements and entertained . 9,493 guests. Staff costs were £6.2million and £326,000 was spent on . official entertaining and receptions. His utility bills dropped by £2,000 to £184,000 for the year. Charles . also spent £140,000 on tending his gardens and staff picked more than . 200 kilos of crab apples from his gardens at Highgrove to make . crab-apple jelly for his shop. A spokesman denied suggestions that the heir to the throne in any way enjoyed a ‘lavish lifestyle’. Prince Charles spent more than £1.2million on official travel last year – including £250,000 on hiring a private jet to attend Nelson Mandela’s funeral. The heir to the throne was by far the biggest royal user of private jets and helicopters, covering 46,000 miles on official duties over the past 12 months. Although his total travel bill was almost double the previous year’s figures, the rise is somewhat artificial because many of his overseas costs in 2012/13 were covered by the countries where he was travelling. But yesterday’s royal accounts still laid bare some expensive journeys. Charles and Camilla’s official tour of India last autumn, after which they travelled to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka, cost £433,020. Similarly a tour last year to the Middle East, also conducted by private jet, cost £243,180. ‘These trips just could not have been carried out by scheduled flights due to the number of countries visited and the sheer schedule of the engagements that had been packed in,’ an aide said last night. Questions are also sure to be asked about flights taken by the Duke of York when the accounts are laid before Parliament. ‘Air Miles Andy’ managed to spend £14,692 on a charter aircraft to take him to Edinburgh and back for official engagements which, happily for the golf fan, included a trip to The Open at Muirhead. A surprising addition to the list of high spenders was the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, who racked up £25,575 on scheduled flights to and from Seoul, South Korea, on what is described only as an ‘FCO visit’. Overall, travel costs for the Royal Family were down by 7 per cent to £4.2million. The Queen is hoping to reduce costs further by leasing a helicopter for the next 12 months.","Heir to the throne saw 'pay packet' from Duchy of Cornwall rise by £500k .

"Missing Flight MH370 did not crash and its current whereabouts may be know to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Boeing aircraft company, Malaysia's influential former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has claimed. Dr Mahathir said the plane could have been switched onto autopilot remotely by the CIA if it had been hijacked. 'Remotely by radio or satellite links by government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency, if terrorists attempt to gain control of the flight deck,' he wrote in an entry entitled 'What goes up must come down' on his blog, chedet. Scroll down for video . Someone's hiding something: Ex Malaysian PM Dr Mahathir (above, left) said the missing plane may have had its MAS airline markings removed and the Australian co-ordinated search out of Perth for debris was 'a waste of time and money' Did not crash: Dr Mahathir says missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 (file photo) could not have crashed because modern communications systems meant that it could not simply disappear off the radar . 'Airplanes don’t just disappear,' he said. 'Certainly not these days with all the powerful communication systems, radio and satellite tracking and filmless cameras which operate almost indefinitely and possess huge storage capacities.' 'The plane is somewhere, maybe without MAS [Malaysia Airlines] markings,' he said, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. 'It is a waste of time and money to look for debris or oil slick or to listen for pings from the black box.“For some reason, the media will not print anything that involves Boeing or the CIA,' he said. Dr Mahathir, 88, who was Malaysia's prime minister between 1981 and 2003, said the missing flight's communication system 'must have been disabled'. Waste of time and money: the former Malaysian PM Dr Mahathir says the air-sea sorties over the Indian Ocean by aircraft such as the  Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion (above) to try and locate the remains of Flight MH370 are futile . 'Or else the flight of MH370 would have been tracked by satellites which normally provide data on all commercial flights, inclusive of data on location, kind of aircraft, flight number, departure airport and destination. 'But the data seems unavailable. The plane just disappeared seemingly from all screens. 'MH370 is a Boeing 777 aircraft. It was built and equipped by Boeing. 'All the communications and GPS equipment must have been installed by Boeing. If they failed or have been disabled Boeing must know how it can be done. 'Surely Boeing would ensure that they cannot be easily disabled as they are vital to the safety and operation of the plane.' Dr Mahathir's blog posts come after the current Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak described the location by satellite of purported MH370 debris in the Indian Ocean as 'bizarre' and 'hard to believe'. Mr Najib told CNN he did not believe it when he first heard about the critical satellite data on which the current search in the Indian Ocean is based on. 'To be honest, I found it hard to believe,' said the Prime Minister. 'It's a bizarre scenario which none of us could have contemplated so that's why when I met the team...of foremost experts in aviation industry I asked them again and again ""are you sure?""''And their answer to me was we are as sure as we can possibly be.' Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities met last weekend to discuss the latest stages of the MH370 by ships staged in the Southern Ocean. Chinese navy survey ship Zhu Kezhen will start mapping the seabed off the west Australian coast this week as part of the latest phase in the search, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Center said.","CIA and Boeing may be hiding information about missing MH370 .

"David Cameron has been urged to confront French President Francois Hollande over claims the country is funding ISIS terrorists by paying ransoms to free hostages. Britain and the United States refuse to negotiate with terrorists in an effort not to encourage further hostage taking. But this policy is being undermined by European countries negotiating secret deals to free their citizens. Over the last five years Islamic State - also known as ISIS or ISIL - is thought to have earned £75million ransoming more than 50 captives. Kidnapping Europeans has become the main source of revenue for Al Qaeda and its spin off – the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: David Cameron has been urged to confront French president Francois Hollande, right, over claims his country is paying huge sums to have hostages returned . US airstrikes slowed the militants' march on Kurdish forces in the north of Iraq, and have helped government forces retake Mosul dam, but ISIS continues to win battles over the border in Syria . French president Francois Hollande (second right) welcomes former hostages (left to right) Marc Feret, Pierre Legrand, Daniel Larribe and Thierry Dol home last year after they were kidnapped by Al-Qaeda in Niger . US airstrikes slowed the militants' march on Kurdish forces in the north of Iraq, and have helped government forces retake Mosul dam, but ISIS continues to win battles over the border in Syria. Four French and three Spanish hostages have been released this year after money was delivered through an intermediary, the New York Times reported today. Fears have been raised that European countries’ policy of secretly negotiating with terrorists is undermining the West’s response to the growing threat from ISIS. Tory MP Andrew Rosindall, who sits on the respected Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘If they are paying ransoms they are harming the interests of the free world and by playing the game of terrorism by paying ransom money they are funding and furthering the cause of ISIS and Al Qaeda. Flow of terror funds: Switzerland, France, Austria and Spain are accused of paying ransoms to terrorist groups along with Qatar and Oman . ISIS yesterday captured four more hostages in Syria, which it will likely try to ransom. It asked the U.S. for a multi-million dollar ransom for James Foley (pictured) but the request was rejected . ‘The French and the Spanish should really look at themselves in the mirror and ask whether this is the right thing to do.’ ‘I think Parliament will be angry – and the British people will be angry. Once again it’s left to Britain and America to stand firm while other countries wobble. ‘The Prime Minister should be raising this with President Hollande. The French are undermining all of us by doing this.’ A Foreign Office source admitted it was a concern for the Government. ‘It is definitely an issue,’ the source said. ‘All you can do is emphasise what we do and why we think it is right. A lot of countries won’t talk about it. Some countries will say one thing and another thing happens.’ But a former senior Cabinet minister told MailOnline that there was no point ‘tweaking the French tail’ because the UK would not get anywhere. ISIS is making money from hostage ransoms and a black market trade in oil, while also recruiting thousands of fighters from across the globe - including at least 500 from Britain - using videos like this one released in July . He added: ‘They don’t admit it. It comes out through what other people say. When you see a French President on the tarmac greeting a freed hostage you can be fairly sure they paid.’ Militants are now thought to hold more than 20 captives, mostly aid workers, journalists and photographers who they are ransoming in order to raise funds. In the past week ISIS forces have also seized 12 villages to the north of Aleppo in Syria as they battle government forces to take control of the country's largest city. Two Italian women, a Dane and a Japanese national were seized near Aleppo yesterday, according to The Guardian. It is thought they will be taken to their stronghold of Raqqa, before the group issues ransom demands. Three other American citizens, including journalists Austin Tice, US, and Steven Sotloff, are still thought to be held captive by ISIS. ISIS yesterday captured four more hostages in Syria, which it will likely try to ransom. It asked the U.S. for a multi-million dollar ransom for James Foley (pictured) but the request was rejected . The Arabic Al Hayat newspaper also reported that a former Islamic State prisoner saw his jailers demanding $100,000 apiece for freeing two ethnic Armenians held in a prison in northeastern Syria. According to a statement by the US Treasury in June, ransom payments are now the second largest source of income for terrorist groups, after state sponsorship. The fanatical group had also demanded $132million to release journalist James Foley before he was executed, but the request was rejected as the US does not negotiate with terrorists. As well as money, the terror group had also requested the release of Aafia Siddiqui, an M.I.T. graduate and Pakistani neuroscientist with ties to Al Qaeda currently locked up in Texas. Recent estimates have put ISIS's income at around $1million a month, but in July experts revealed the group are sitting on oil reserves that could bring in around $1million a day. The jihadists are thought to be smuggling barrels of unrefined crude oil into Turkey and Iran where they offer it up for $25 (£15) a barrel, making a huge profit. Industry experts believe the fighters are taking the oil from plains south of Mosul and transporting it in tankers, owned by the extremists, so it can be turned into diesel and petrol. A major recruitment drive in July across social media networks such as Twitter also saw ISIS bolster its forces with thousands of fighters drawn from across the globe. At least 500 Britons are thought to have joined the group, thanks in part to an English-language recruitment video featuring , Reyaad Khan, Abu Muthana Al Yemeni and Abu Bara' Al Hindi. However, Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood has since put the number of British recruits at 1,500. ISIS is making money from hostage ransoms and a black market trade in oil, while also recruiting thousands of fighters from across the globe - including at least 500 from Britain - using videos like this one released in July . Last month, fighters overran the Division 17 military base in Raqqa, killing at least 85 soldiers, while two weeks later the extremists seized the nearby Brigade 93 base after days of heavy fighting. In recent days Islamic State soldiers also seized 12 villages near the base, which contains several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition. Masrour Barzani, chancellor of the Kurdish region security council, said that ISIS soldiers are using five divisions worth of US-supplied Iraqi weapons to outgun their opponents. Since July, Islamic State fighters have methodically picked off isolated government bases in northern and eastern Syria, killing and decapitating army commanders and pro-government militiamen. Yesterday there were reports of fierce clashes around the facility accompanied by government airstrikes in which at least six fighters were killed.","UK and US refuse to negotiate with terrorists to stop further hostage taking .

"If you're making a list and checking it twice, you might want to check a third time to make sure that the toys you're preparing to purchase this holiday season aren't dangerous. World Against Toys Causing Harm, or W.A.T.C.H., has issued the '10 Worst Toys' list to remind parents and consumers of the potential hazards in some toys as the holiday shopping season gets underway. They include things such as a light-up bow whose arrows are advertised as flying up to 145 feet and the 'Catapencil' — a pencil with a miniature slingshot-style launcher on its end. Both have been placed on an annual list of unsafe toys released by a Massachusetts-based consumer watchdog group. Scroll down for video . Hammering the message home: James Swartz, director of World Against Toys Causing Harm Inc., holds up toy battle hammer at Children's Franciscan Hospital in Boston . Fired: This toy machine gun is on the list as one of the 10 most unsafe toys as the holiday season approaches . Rough ride: The seat of this small, four-wheeled cycle is approximately 8 inches off theground. Young children are encouraged to 'swerve & spin', 'try new tricks' and 'race aroundthe block….' Its low profile makes the toy potentially hazardous for outdoor use and the kid should be wearing a helmet . Organizers, who have been compiling the lists for over four decades, said the toys singled out this year are representative of some of the typical problems they come across, and aren't the only potentially dangerous products on the market. 'It's not so much about the specific toys. It's about the hazards,' James Swartz, the group's director, said at a news conference at the Franciscan Hospital for Children. Many toys, he said, continue to have the same hazardous designs, including small, detachable parts that infants can choke on; strings that can cause strangulation; dangerous projectiles; and misleading or confusing warning labels and instructions. 'There's no reason, after all these years, we should have toys like this,' Swartz said as the group displayed each of the ten toys. 'We shouldn't be finding these things for manufacturers. They should be designing them appropriately in the first place.'

The message on the back of this combination pencil and slingshot 'Play Safe and Enjoy!!!' is ironic . Dr. Penny Norman, who developed ScienceWiz's 'Bottle Rocket Party,' was surprised the company's kit, which includes rocket tubes, stoppers and yellow 'caution tape' but not other necessary or recommended items, such as a bicycle pump or safety goggles, made the list. She said the idea for the kits, which have been on the market since about 2005 and retail for around $15, came after doing homemade bottle rocket experiments with children at summer camps and after-school programs in the Berkeley, California, area. 'It's a time-honored event for children,' Norman said of launching the water or baking soda-and-vinegar-powered rockets. 'But it isn't about children being set loose to play with them on their own. It's absolutely about adults running a bottle rocket party event safely.' Robert Pasin, Radio Flyer's 'Chief Wagon Officer' and a grandson of the founder, maintained that the company's four-wheeled 'Ziggle' cycle, which W.A.T.C.H. criticized because it's low to the ground, is safe.  'For more than 97 years Radio Flyer has been producing high-quality products for children. We test and research all of our products,' he said. The Toy Industry Association said American toy safety standards 'remain the most protective in the world' and that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the federal agency responsible for monitoring the safety of toys, 'consistently' ranks toys among the safest of 15 consumer product categories commonly found in the home. Choking hazard: These dolls, marketed for oral-age children as young as 2-years-old, aretouted as the 'perfect friend for your little one.' Many of these toys, however, are sold with adecorative bow made of ribbon which can detach from the head of the baby doll, posing thepotential for choking if ingested . Ready, aim, throw it away! A Catapencil is a pencil with a built in slingshot and it on the '10 worst toys list . Endless list: 'Dangerous toys continue to abound in toy boxes and on store shelves. The alarming number of toy recalls and the lack of pre-market testing and regulations in the toy industry are evidence of the need for continued vigilance for the safety of children,' the group writes on its website. 'As an industry that creates magical products for children, we hold ourselves to the highest possible standard of care,' the association said in a statement. 'Like WATCH, members of the toy industry are intent on assuring that the toys consumers bring into their homes are safe for their families. Unlike WATCH, we maintain our priority focus on toy safety every day of the year.' Joan Siff, W.A.T.C.H.'s president, noted that there have been at least 17 toy recalls representing over 4.8 million units of toys in the U.S. and Canada so far in 2014. She urged parents to be extra vigilant during the holiday season, when W.A.T.C.H. says more than 65 percent of toys are sold. 'Remember: Toys are an embellishment on life,' Siff said. 'They are not a necessity. If they can injure a child, they simply should not be sold.' Hairy situation: This soft, colorful hedgehog is sold for infants. The toy has long, fiber-likehair that is not adequately rooted and is easily removable, presenting the potential for ingestionor aspiration injuries. This hazard is not referenced anywhere on the product or product tag . Dangerous: The 'Air Storm Firetek Bow' toy presents a risk for eye injuries . Not as cute as you think: Joan Siff, president of W.A.T.C.H.holds the 'Lil' Cutesies - Best Friends' toy which can present a risk for choking if the cloth bow is removed .","The toys on this year's list spanned age groups from infants to eight- year-olds .

"David Cameron was facing a backlash within his own Cabinet today after softening his opposition to a new European treaty he vetoed last month. Downing Street confirmed that the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson had both raised concerns at this morning’s weekly Cabinet meeting about Mr Cameron’s apparent change of heart in Brussels. The Prime Minister was also attacked by Labour leader Ed Miliband in the Commons this afternoon after he made a statement to explain why he has given the green light to the Eurozone countries using the European Court of Justice to police a new ‘fiscal compact’. Objections: Minister Iain Duncan Smith, left, who led previous Tory rebellions over Europe, today objected to David Cameron's apparent EU u-turn . Mocking Mr Cameron's claim he vetoed last month's treaty, Mr Miliband said: 'With this Prime Minister a veto isn't for life, it's just for Christmas.' Updating MPs on the latest European Council (EU) summit, the PM said the eurozone debt crisis was having 'a chilling effect' on the UK economy . And he told the Commons: 'I went to the European Council last December prepared to agree a treaty of all 27 countries, but only if there were proper safeguards for Britain. 'I did not get those safeguards so I vetoed that treaty.' Labour MPs scoffed with laughter as Mr Cameron continued: 'As a result, eurozone countries are now making separate arrangements outside the EU treaties for strengthening budgetary discipline, including ensuring there are much tougher rules on deficits.' Twenty-five of the 27 EU countries agreed yesterday's Brussels deal, with just Britain and the Czech Republic failing to opt in. Distance: David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy were close last year, bottom, but were some distance apart last night (top) But Mr Cameron said the UK would . allow the institutions to be used to monitor the new rules, having . previously said the European Commission and the European Court of . Justice could not have responsibility for monitoring deals agreed . outside the full EU. Today, the Prime Minister said the . new agreement sets out new roles of the European Commission and the . European Court of Justice, adding: 'The new inter-governmental agreement . is absolutely explicit and clear that it cannot encroach on the . competencies of the European Union and they must not take measures that . in any way undermine the EU single market. 'We will watch this closely and if . necessary we will take action, including legal action, if our national . interests are threatened by the misuse of the institutions.' Mr Duncan Smith, who led Tory . rebellions over Europe in the John Major years, questioned the legality . of the move, which Mr Cameron ruled out last month. Mr Paterson said the EU should be . focusing on improving trade and competitiveness rather than trying to . force through new treaties. Tory MPs last night accused Mr . Cameron of backtracking in order to ‘appease’ his Liberal Democrat . deputy Nick Clegg, who was infuriated by his tough stance last month. Tory Philip Davies accused the Prime . Minister of ‘waving the white flag’ – and compared him to Mr Major, . whose Government was torn apart by infighting over Europe. The Prime Minister yesterday said he would now only block the move if Britain’s national interest was directly ‘threatened’. But he pointed out that Britain remains outside the deal, which forces Eurozone countries to adopt tough austerity measures. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has . refused to say whether he would have signed the treaty last month, said . the Prime Minister ‘seems to have sold us down the river on a lot of . things’. Furious Eurosceptics compared the Premier to his predecessor Mr Major . after he agreed eurozone countries could use the European Court of . Justice to police the rules of their new fiscal compact to prop up the . single currency. British diplomats have negotiated changes in the wording of the treaty which they believe will ensure that the Court of Justice is not used to meddle with the single market, which Britain is signed up to. But the Conservative leader in the European Parliament issued a withering press release after a meeting with the Prime Minister, saying he had no choice but to agree to the plans because Mr Clegg wanted the treaty to go ahead. In favour: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has been an advocate of the EU treaty . Martin Callanan said: ‘There is no doubt that the Government’s position has altered since the December summit. ‘I blame a combination of appeasing Nick Clegg, who is desperate to sign anything the EU puts in front of him, and the reality that this pact is actually quite hard to prevent.’ Today Ed Miliband said Mr Cameron lost the opportunity to defend Britain’s interests in negotiations when he walked out of talks on the new treaty last month. Mr Miliband told Sky News: 'If you walk away from the negotiating table, it is very hard to secure a good deal for your country. 'He went into these talks saying his real worry was about financial services and how that would be affected if other countries went ahead. He has secured no extra protections for financial services.' Mr Cameron was monitored yesterday by a member of Mr Clegg’s staff – a symbol of the distrust between the coalition partners on Europe after Mr Cameron’s veto caught the Deputy Prime Minister by surprise. Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: ‘We saw how popular David Cameron was in the opinion polls after he used his veto. We don’t want David Cameron to go down the road of waving the white flag. ‘This will define whether he’s seen as a Thatcher or a Major, and I’m afraid the comparison will be with John Major.’ Tory MEP Dan Hannan said: ‘December’s “veto” turns out to be nothing of the kind; at best, it is a partial opt-out. Britain had asked for concessions in return for allowing the other member states to use EU institutions and structures for their fiscal compact. ‘No such concessions were forthcoming, but we have given them permission anyway.’ Privately British officials made clear that they think the fiscal compact is unwise and will lock smaller European countries in a German-imposed financial straitjacket. Mr Cameron received a small boost when the Czechs decided not to back the fiscal compact, leaving Britain in a minority of two rather than one. Germany backed down yesterday over plans to impose a Brussels economic commissioner on Greece to force it to cut spending.","Anger at PM's decision to agree to allow eurozone countries to use European Court of Justice to police their fiscal policies .

"The Duchess of Cambridge will not travel to Malta this weekend for her first official solo overseas royal visit because she continues to suffer with extreme morning sickness. Kate, 32, who is around eight weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition. The illness saw Kate hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby, Prince George, now one. Scroll down for video . The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge (last pictured with Prince William on August 5) will not travel to Malta this weekend for her first solo overseas royal visit  after continuing to suffer from severe bouts of morning sickness . Kensington Palace today confirmed the Duchess would not travel to Malta this weekend with a statement which said she 'continues to suffer from the effects of hyperemesis gravidarum'. The Duchess had been due to represent the Queen on a two-day visit to the Mediterranean island as Malta celebrates the 50th anniversary of its independence from Britain. However, the palace confirmed today that Prince William would instead take her place. In a statement, the palace said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge will no longer visit Malta this weekend. The Duke of Cambridge will undertake the visit instead. 'Her Royal Highness continues to suffer from the effects of hyperemesis gravidarum. The decision not to travel was taken by the Duke and Duchess on the advice of the Duchess's doctors. 'The Duke is honoured to represent Her Majesty The Queen on the visit, which commemorates the 50th anniversary of Malta's independence. 'The visit itinerary remains unchanged.' Kate, 32, who is around eight weeks pregnant, suffered the same illness throughout her first pregnancy with Prince George. She had been due to represent the Queen on a two-day visit to the Mediterranean island . Royal sources earlier told the Mail that the Duchess wanted to wait until the last possible minute to decide whether she was medically fit to go. Her decision came after a consultation with doctors last night. Despite being 'desperate' to attend her first royal overseas appointment, the Duchess reluctantly agreed to cancel after meeting with Alan Farthing, surgeon-gynaecologist to the Royal Household, and her obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston at Kensington Palace. Her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12-week stage but there is speculation that the royal couple's second child could be due in April. The trip to Malta was to be one of the first solo trips on behalf of the Queen for the Duchess of Cambridge . The Queen's surgeon-gynaecologist Alan Farthing (pictured) is part of the Duchess's medical team . Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies. The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis. It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers. The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences. They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week. It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food. Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat. Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated. Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition. An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice. The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage. The foreign trip had been seen as being a sign of Kate's growing royal role, not least because the island holds such a special place in the Queen's heart. The monarch spent many happy months there before she acceded to the throne when her husband, Prince Philip was stationed there with the Royal Navy. Highlights of the eagerly anticipated trip were a visit to the national library to see letters from past British monarchs Henry VIII and George II, Independence Day celebrations and a number of walkabouts.","Duchess of Cambridge is around eight weeks pregnant with second child .

"Controversial: Amy Chau, the 'Tiger Mom' has published a new book with her husband entitled, 'The Triple Package' which argues that eight groups of people are superior to others . She gained notoriety in 2011 as the uncompromising 'Tiger Mom' - boastful that Chinese mothers make better parents and ultimately have more successful children. Now though, Amy Chau, 51, has inspired the fury of the public on Twitter with her new controversial theory that some races and religions are just superior to everyone else. Dubbed 'simply racist' by one . commentor on Twitter, another pulled no punches and called her . a 'full blown eugenics pushing racist!' Others were more diplomatic charging that 'Chau has now begun treading territory uncomfortably close to racism.' Published in the new book, 'The Triple Package', that she has written with her Jewish husband Jed Rubenfeld, Chua names the eight groupings that are exceptional in no particular order - and unsurprisingly, the Chinese are one of the top dogs. The other seven are Jewish, Indian, Iranian, Lebanese-Americans, Nigerians, Cuban exiles and Mormons. Clearly one of these groupings is a religion and by calling them 'cultural', never ethnic, racial or religious, Chau and her husband seek to avoid the hugely controversial criticism this would bring. However, Chau does identify three distinguishing features these eight peoples have that guarantees them success over others; superiority, insecurity and impulse control. 'That certain groups do much better in America than others — as measured by income, occupational status, test scores and so on — is difficult to talk about,' the authors write. In 'The Triple Package,' Chua and her husband, co-author Jed Rubenfeld (right) - lay out their manifesto for how America is going to succeed in competition with other nations . Family: Chinese American author Amy Chua in Shanghai with her family, 18-year-old Sophia, 14-year-old Louisa, her husband Jed Rubenfeld and her parents, to promote her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother in 2011 . 'In large part, this is because the topic feels so racially charged.' Chau and her husband argue that far from pointing fingers and exulting certain cultural groups, they are agitating for everyone else to follow their example and bring back America's glory days. 'Tiger Mom' Amy Chua and her husband Jed Rubenfeld have penned a new even more controversial parenting theory and guide . Chau, who is a law professor at Yale launched to international fame in 2011 when The Wall Street Journal published an extract from her book, 'Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom'. Raised in the Midwest, Chau's book showed her determination to take the perceived worst stereotypical traits of Chinese women as cold and hostile to their children and make virtues out them. She wrote that she called one of her two daughters 'garbage' for being rude and labeled a homemade birthday card as awful, telling her girl, 'I don't want this - I want another one.' She also refused to let her children watch television, go to sleepovers and even threatened to give-away one of her girl's beloved dollhouses if she couldn't learn to play a classical composition within days. Her book bolstered her opinion that Chinese mother's made the best parents and played on the American fear of the United States being eclipsed by a rising China. The book was a best seller and now her new exploration of family seeks to play on the growing fear of the middle-class never booming again. She breaks down the 'Triple Package' succinctly for her readers as follows: . 1) A superiority complex: Chau believes that any cultural group who innately thinks they are just better than others has an advantage. Ignoring the wars, genocide and abject human misery this kind of thinking has caused, Chau and her husband declare that 'the superiority complex is antithetical to mainstream liberal thinking...the stuff of racism , colonialism, imperialism, Nazism.' 2) Insecurity: Chau and her husband believe that a deep seated insecurity can be a motivating drive to achieving success. 'That insecurity should be a critical lever of success is another anathema, flouting the entire orthodoxy of contemporary popular and therapeutic psychology,' they write according to the New York Post. 'Note that there’s a deep tension between insecurity and a superiority complex,' the authors continue. 'It’s odd to think of people being simultaneously insecure but also convinced of their divine election or superiority.' 3) Impulse Control: Chau thinks that perseverance and patience are virtues that have been lost to most Americans - but still exist among her eight golden cultural groups. U.S. author Amy L. Chua, known as the Tiger Mom, speaks at a promotional event for her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, in Shanghai, China, 22 June 2011 . 'Impulse control refers to the ability to resist temptation, especially the temptation to give up in the face of hardship or quit instead of persevering at a difficult task.' Jewish - Jewish Americans have the highest incomes per head across the nationIndian - Along with Indian AmericansChinese - Chua infamous first book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom explored the relationship between Chinese parents and their children's successIranian -  Iranian-Americans have historically excelled in business, academia, the sciences, arts and entertainmentLebanese-Americans - Such as Ralph Nader have had a significant participation in American politics and social and political activismNigerians - Ivy League admission rates of West African immigrant groups far exceed those of non-immigrant American blacks Cuban exiles - Eva Mendes and Gloria Estefan are prominent Cuban exilesMormons - Mormons such as Mitt Romney are high profile politicians . Those who fail at this are everyone not in the magic eight. 'Because all three elements of the Triple Package run so counter to modern American culture, it makes sense that America’s successful groups are all outsiders in one way or another,' they write. 'Paradoxically, in modern America, a group has an edge if it doesn’t buy into — or hasn’t yet bought into — mainstream, post-1960s, liberal American principles.' Straying into controversial territory, Chau and her husband say that African-Americans don't make the list because the Civil Rights Movement destroyed their chance of any superiority. 'In this paradoxical sense, equality isn’t fair to African-Americans,' they write. 'Superiority is the one narrative that America has relentlessly denied or ground out of its black population.' African immigrants do better than African Americans because they were born on the continent and therefore just as the Chinese believe their 5,000-year-old civilization makes them great - so do Nigerians. Trying to bundle their 'Triple Package' for everyone though is a hard task. After spending much of the book criticizing most Americans, Chau and he husband declare that there the point of their book 'is the promise of a day when there are no longer any successful groups in the United States - only successful individuals.'","Tiger Mom Amy Chua has penned a new parenting guide called 'The Triple Package' which lays out a controversial theory for success in modern America .

"The number of shark attacks in waters around the United States reached the highest level seen in more than a decade last year. There were 53 attacks in the U.S. in 2012 - the most since 2000, which saw the same number of incidents recorded. The 2012 figure - which includes one fatal shark attack - is a significant increase on the 31 incidents recorded in the United States the previous year.

Fatal attack: A sign at Surf Beach, near Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, after surfer Francisco Javier Solorio Jr was killed by a Great White Shark in October . A total of 26 attacks were recorded in Florida, 10 in Hawaii, and five in California - one of which was fatal. South Carolina also saw five attacks, while Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Puerto Rico all recorded one each. In December Tom Kennedy, 61, from Oregon, suffered a serious gash on his left leg when he was bitten by a ten-foot tiger shark as he was snorkelling off the coast of Maui, Hawaii. Mr Kennedy swam for his life when the deadly shark released his leg, managing to reach the safety of his paddle board and summon a friend for help. In October a Californian surfer had a lucky escape after being bitten by a shark off the coast of North Jetty in South Bay. The predator left the 25-year-old with a series of wounds on his torso, and also managed to bite an enormous chunk out of his surfboard before a passing off-duty paramedic rushed to the man's aid at Samoa Beach, near Eureka. The shock attack occurred just a week after another surfer, Francisco Javier Solorio Jr, was attacked by a Great White Shark in Santa Barbara as his friend looked on in horror. The 39-year-old died after the enormous shark sank its teeth into his torso in the waters off Surf Beach on Vandenberg Air Force Base. Mr Solorio was pronounced dead at the scene despite the desperate efforts of his friend, who dragged him from the water on to the beach where he administered first aid.

"King Henry VIII had a secret daughter who should have taken the throne before Elizabeth I, new research has revealed. Elizabeth Tailboys was the Tudor monarch's illegitimate lovechild who would have changed the course of English history had the King acknowledged her as his at the time. By rights she should have taken the throne on the death of Queen Mary in 1558, making her the true Elizabeth I and not Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn. Illegitimate: By rights Elizabeth Tailboys, daughter of Bessie Blount, right should have been Queen instead of Elizabeth I . The decision would have had far reaching consequences for English history and the succession of every monarch since. For example, England may have been invaded by the Spanish Armada which was actually seen off by the English fleet inspired by the real Elizabeth I in 1588. The country could also have become embroiled in religious turmoil as Elizabeth I was credited with religous settlement by founding the Church of England. And with Elizabeth Tailboys' own children on the throne instead of James I and Charles I, the country may have avoided Civil War, and the rule of Parliamentarians. The revelation has been unearthed by . historian Elizabeth Norton who has re-examined royal records as part of . an investigation into the life of Henry VIII's famous mistress Bessie . Blount. Mrs Norton . discovered Elizabeth Tailboy's was not the daughter of Bessie's future . husband Gilbert Tailboys as previously thought, but the secret lovechild . of the King. A picture of Henry VIII's lock for his private apartments - he is said to have taken it everywhere and kept the key to himself . Mrs . Norton found Elizabeth was born between April and June 1520, a year . after her brother Henry, who was acknowledged as the King's. Both . children were conceived during a period when Henry VIII lived a few . miles away from Bessie's home and when he was known to visit her . regularly. This was also two years before Bessie married Gilbert Tailboys who later gave Elizabeth his surname. The date of Elizabeth's birth made her younger than Mary I but older than Elizabeth, both of whom were also declared illegitimate by the King when he deemed his marriages to their mothers invalid. However, because he acknowledged them as his, they were included in the Tudor succession after Henry failed to produce further sons. The historian also noted the King paid particular attention to Elizabeth throughout his life, unusually adjudicating on court cases involving her and securing her financial interests. Mrs Norton, an author and historian who studied at Cambridge and Oxford universities, said: 'If Henry had acknowledged her, it could have changed the whole course of British history. 'Bessie Blount is widely known to . have been Henry's mistress, and she was already the mother of his . acknowledged son Henry Fitzroy. Elizabeth Tailboys - the lovechild of Henry VIII, pictured left, should have taken the throne after the death of Queen Mary in 1558 making her the true Elizabeth I and not Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn, pictured right . 'But I believe the evidence and dates make it likely that he was also the father of her second daughter Elizabeth. 'As . far as we know, she was conceived about three years before she met her . husband Gilbert Tailboys, who would later give her his surname. 'At that time, Henry was staying in the same area as Bessie, within ten miles of her for the whole summer. 'Put simply, we know he was sleeping with her mother. 'In addition to the conception dates, there is also legal evidence that Henry took a personal interest in Bessie and Elizabeth's affairs. 'It would have been very odd for a King to take such an interest in a girl with a relatively minor title otherwise. 'It's highly probably that she was the King's child, but because she was a girl she was of little significance to him - he had no reason to acknowledge her as he did her brother. 'If he had acknowledged her, he would have had to consider her in the succession along with his two other illegitimate daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. 'That would result in further problems for Henry. 'To include two 'illegitimate' daughters in the succession but not a third would suggest that some of his illegitimate daughers were perhaps less illegitimate than others - a political point the King had no wish to make.' Bessie also had a third child, George Tailboys, born two years after Elizabeth and indisputably fathered by her husband Gilbert. Mrs Norton has now published the startling research in a new book, Bessie Blount; Mistress to Henry VIII, which is available from Amberley Publishing costing £25.","Elizabeth Tailboys would have changed the course of English history had the King acknowledged her as his .

"As electricity returns and highways reopen, some Northeast residents are getting back to their weekday routines following the massive snowstorm that had millions digging out from New York to Maine. But the routine for other New Englanders will be disrupted by school and workplace closings. For some there's also a new worry: the danger of roof collapses as rain and warmer weather melts snow. The storm that slammed into the region with up to 3 feet of snow was blamed for at least 15 deaths in the Northeast and Canada, and brought some of the highest accumulations ever recorded. Still, coastal areas were largely spared catastrophic damage despite being lashed by strong waves and hurricane-force wind gusts at the height of the storm. Ceaseless: A man heads out to clear snow as it falls again, Monday in Concord, New Hampshire . All aboard: Travelers board a bus at the MRTA station in Haverhill, Massachusetts on Monday after state officials urged commuters to take public transportation when possible . No rush: Haverhill, Massachusetts resident Matt Church enjoys his breakfast at a coffee shop on Monday as beleaguered residents returned to work for the first time since the weekend blizzard . Hundreds of people, their homes without heat or electricity, were forced to take refuge in emergency shelters set up in schools or other places. But by early Monday, outages had dropped to 149,970 — more than 126,000 of them in Massachusetts. 'For all the complaining everyone does, people really came through,' said Rich Dinsmore, 65, of Newport, R.I., who was staying at a Red Cross shelter set up in a middle school in Middletown after the power went out in his home on Friday. Dinsmore, who has emphysema, was first brought by ambulance to a hospital after the medical equipment he relies on failed when the power went out and he had difficulty breathing. 'The police, the fire department, the state, the Red Cross, the volunteers, it really worked well,' said the retired radio broadcaster and Army veteran. Taking it slowly: A car pulls out of a drive in Long Island on Monday as skies remain grey and snow is piled high on the sides of the road . No way out: Heavy snow hides any delineation between road and sidewalk in Nesconset, Long Island . Warning: A makeshift sign in Long Island tells drivers not to bother taking this road . Driving bans were lifted and flights resumed at major airports in the region that had closed during the storm, though many flights were still canceled Sunday. Public transit schedules were being restored. The Boston-area public transportation system, which shut down on Friday afternoon, resumed full service on Monday - but told commuters to expect delays. The Metro-North Railroad resumed most train service on its New York and Connecticut routes while the Long Island Rail Road said commuters could expect a nearly normal schedule. 'A lot of progress has been made,' said Salvatore Arena, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North. Some public schools canceled classes . on Monday, including in Boston, Providence and on Long Island, while . local governments in some areas told non-essential workers to take the . day off. On eastern . Long Island, the harrowing images from New York's slice of the massive . snowstorm - people stranded overnight, cars abandoned on long stretches . of drift-covered highways - were slowly erased Sunday as hundreds of . snowplows and heavy equipment descended to try to help clear the way for .

Pow-wow: With more than a hundred trucks waiting to deploy, National Grid and utility workers meet to discuss their plan to re-energize towns without power at the Hanover Mall in Hanover, Massachusetts . Long Island was slammed with as much as 30 inches of snow, which shut down roads, including the Long Island Expressway. A 27-mile stretch of the road was closed Sunday and but the roadway reopened Monday in time for the morning commute. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said more than a third of all the state's snow-removal equipment was sent to the area, including more than 400 plow trucks and more than 100 snowblowers, loaders and backhoes. 'The massive amount of snow left behind effectively shut down the entire region,' Cuomo said. On . Sunrise Highway, which runs parallel to the Long Island Expressway, . Dennis Lawrence, of Bellport, N.Y., had already spent 90 minutes digging . out the car he had abandoned and had at least another 30-60 minutes to . go on Sunday. He left it there Friday after getting stuck on his way . home from his job in New York City. 'The . car was all over the place, it just slid over and wouldn't move,' the . 54-year-old elevator mechanic said. 'I finally decided today to come and . get it.' The thaw has begun but there's lots of snow left. These cars remain buried in Hamden, Connecticut on Sunday . There's still plenty left! Small planes are snowed in at the closed Bridgeport airport in Connecticut on Sunday . Utility crews, some brought in from as far away as Georgia, Oklahoma and Quebec, raced to restore power. By early Monday, less than 150,000 customers still had no electricity - down from 650,000 in eight states at the height of the storm. In hardest-hit Massachusetts, officials said some of the outages might linger until Tuesday. Boston recorded 24.9 inches of snow, . making it the fifth-largest storm in the city since records were kept. The city was appealing to the state and private contractors for more . front-end loaders and other heavy equipment to clear snow piles that . were clogging residential streets. The . National Weather Service was forecasting rain and warmer temperatures . in the region on Monday - which could begin melting some snow but also . add considerable weight to snow already piled on roofs, posing the . danger of collapse. Of greatest concern were flat or gently-sloped roofs . and officials said people should try to clear them - but only if they . could do so safely. 'We . don't recommend that people, unless they're young and experienced, go . up on roofs,' said Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts . Emergency Management Agency.

In Middlefield, Conn., two cows were killed when the roof of a barn gave way under the weight of heavy snow - one of two such incidents in the state that prompted agriculture officials to issue an advisory to farmers. Officials also continued to warn of carbon monoxide dangers in the wake of the storm. In . Boston, two people died Saturday after being overcome by carbon . monoxide while sitting in running cars, including a teenager who went . into the family car to stay warm while his father shoveled snow. The . boy's name was not made public. In a third incident, two children were . hospitalized but expected to recover.

In Maine, the Penobscot County Sheriff's office said it recovered the body of a 75-year-old man who died after the pickup he was driving struck a tree and plunged into the Penobscot River during the storm. Investigators said Gerald Crommett apparently became disoriented while driving in the blinding snow. Christopher Mahood, 23, of Germantown, N.Y., died after his tractor went off his driveway while he was plowing snow Friday night and rolled down a 15-foot embankment. In Massachusetts, eight teams were formed to assess damage from flooding along the state's coastline, with the hardest hit-areas including historic Plymouth and portions of Cape Cod. 'Considering the severity of the storm, the amount of snow and the wind, we've come through this pretty well,' Gov. Deval Patrick told CBS's Face The Nation after meeting with local officials in Plymouth. The U.S. Postal Service said that mail delivery that was suspended in the six New England states, as well as parts of New York and New Jersey, because of the snowstorm would resume Monday, where it is safe to do so.","149,970 remain without power with more than 126,000 of them in Massachusetts after storm slams Northeast on Friday and Saturday .

"As firefighters battle to contain the Colorado wildfires and clean-up crews trawl through the debris following the Oklahoma tornado, a series of maps have been published that illustrate the most deadly places in America.

Top of the shops: John Lewis beat competitors in three categories of a consumer poll of 6,000 people . John Lewis also won top spot in the customer service category and was favourite home retailer both in-store and online in the poll by Conlumino. The retail analysts expressed ‘slight surprise’ at Amazon’s success after criticism of the web giant’s efforts to minimise tax payments in the UK. However, Conlumino said it had become something of a cliche to find John Lewis topping polls of the UK’s favourite shops. The absence of discount grocers from the top three was ‘notable’. Commercial director Stephen Ward said they scored well on prices but not in other areas. The firm surveyed 6,049 consumers from May to July. John Lewis, pictured, benefited alongside other names including Waitrose, HMV and online giant Amazon . Mr Ward added: 'This more constrained environment is one that could have worked against Waitrose, but instead the company is motoring in terms of growth and in terms of satisfying consumers. 'Discounters are more one dimensional. It’s easy to like their low prices but it’s more difficult to fall in love with them as firms.'

"Footage of strangers kissing seems to be in vogue at the moment. The First Kiss, in which artist Tatia Pilieva asks 20 complete strangers to lock lips on screen, set social media sites ablaze last week. But back in 1872, one pioneering English photographer was ahead of the trend when he filmed what is thought to be the first ever footage of a couple kissing. Scroll down for video... Due to social conventions of the time, the kiss is between two female models as photographer Eadweard Muybridge was unable to film naked men in the same frame as naked women. ‘While the Victorians were extremely sexually prudish by modern standards and commonly considered male homosexuality a serious threat to their society they believed women had little or no sex drive,’ states Muybride Online archive. ‘The Kiss’, like most of the image sequences in the Muybride Online archive, was produced some time between 1872 and 1885 - significantly before the invention of the motion picture camera. Due to social conventions of the time, the kiss is between two female models as Eadweard Muybridge was unable to film naked men in the same frame . Eadweard Muybridge's biographical details are just as intriguing as his work. Born Edward Muggeridge in 1830 at Kingston upon Thames, he was unsatisfied with life in this small English town, and by 1850 he had left to make his fortune in the U.S. His most famous work began in 1872, when he was hired by Leland Stanford  to photograph horses. But the photographer became distracted when he found that his young wife had taken a lover. Muybridge . shot and killed the man, called Major Harry Larkyns, . after learning that he may have fathered their seven-month-old son.When Muybridge stood trial, he did not deny the killing, but he was nonetheless acquitted. It was created using banks of still cameras firing in sequence. Essentially, every one of Muybridge’s plates is a film first, according to the archive. In the 1870s, details of how objects move were unknown. Without film, the human eye was unable to understand details of fast motion. For the Kingston-born photographer, nudity was crucial so that viewers could clearly see how the body moved in his series of photographs. And it wasn’t just human activity that the photographer captured. In 1872, Muybride was hired by Leland Stanford, later the founder of Stanford University, to photograph horses. Stanford reputedly had made a bet that for a moment, all four of a racehorse's hooves are off the ground simultaneously, and he hired Muybridge to take the pictures to prove him right. The photographers own biographical details are just as intriguing as his work. Muybridge shot and killed his wife’s lover, a man called Major Harry Larkyns, after learning that he may have fathered their seven-month-old son. When Muybridge stood trial, he did not deny the killing, but he was nonetheless acquitted. Muybridge spent the rest of his career improving his technique, lecturing, and publishing. At the end of his life, Muybridge returned from the U.S to England, where he died in 1904.

"Lean on me: Mr Fox, has travelled with owner Jessica Johnson for the last 30 years, including to the Tower of Pisa, Italy . From Las Vegas and New York to London, Paris and Rome, one much-loved cuddly toy is also one of the most well-travelled, after accompanying its owner on holiday for the past 30 years. Mr Fox was given to Jessica Johnson when she was just 3-years-old and the pair have been inseparable ever since. The globe-trotting toy has visited some of the world's top tourist attractions including the Vatican, Buckingham Palace, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

Family friend Gary Moore was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and she hopes to raise enough money to send him on a 'bucket list' round-the-world trip. She said: 'I've carried Mr Fox with me since I was a baby, and he's the only physical memento I have from my childhood. 'The pictures started out as a lark. But I wanted to show Mr Fox having his own adventures. 'Mr Fox seemed a really appropriate way to try and get some attention, because Gary was the one who bought him for me.' During three decades of travel, Mr Fox has enjoyed strawberries and cream at Wimbledon, been on the London Eye and toured the canals of Venice. He has visited the Eiffel Tower, been to the graves of dead Popes, and has even been inside one of the Nuremberg court trial rooms.

"Lots of people say they're intolerant to it, but most of them don't even know what it is. That's what talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel says is the case in Los Angeles, where he says eating gluten is considered worse than Satanism. And, at least according to his research, it seems he is right. On his late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live, the presenter said: 'I don't know if it's just here in L.A., but people are very anti-gluten. Which bothers me, because I'm very pro pizza. 'And you can't be pro-pizza and anti-gluten.' Scroll down for video . Do you know what gluten is? This man didn't when asked by Jimmy Kimmel's researchers, despite saying he won't eat it . Neither did this man, who admitted he didn't have an answer. He did say he was another non-gluten-eating Los Angeles resident though . Kimmel said he suspected some people don't eat gluten because 'someone in their yoga class told them not to,' so he sent someone to interview people who avoid gluten just what it was they were steering clear of. 'This is pretty sad, 'cause I don't know,' the first man on the show replied. The second man said: 'Gluten is in bread. It's a flour derivative, wheat, things like that …. It's like bread, pastries …. It's in those things. Gluten is like a grain, right? 'It's the wheat in products in like bread or pastas or rice,' a woman said. 'It makes you fat. I haven't researched it to the fullest. I have a girlfriend from Russia and she got me into it.' Awkward: This woman said her friend is writing a book about gluten, and she didn't eat it. She didn't know what it was though . A bit embarrassing: This man in the ""superjew"" T-shirt said he didn't know either . The fourth man interviewed didn't have a better answer. According to the Los Angeles Times only around one in 133 people in the U.S. are intolerant to gluten, the protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Gluten refers to the proteins found in wheat endosperm (a type of tissue produced in seeds that's ground to make flour). Gluten both nourishes plant embryos during germination and later affects the elasticity of dough, which in turn affects the chewiness of baked wheat products. Gluten is actually composed of two different proteins: gliadin (a prolamin protein) and glutenin (a glutelin protein). Though 'true gluten' is sometimes defined as being specific to wheat, gluten is often said to be part of other cereal grains — including rye, barley and various crossbreeds — because these grains also contain protein composites made from prolamins and glutelins. It isn't necessarily bad, but some people are gluten-intolerant, meaning their bodies produce an abnormal immune response when it breaks down gluten from wheat and related grains during digestion. The most well-known form of gluten intolerance is celiac disease, which affects one in every 141 people in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. When someone with celiac disease consumes gluten, it triggers an immune response that damages their intestines, preventing them from absorbing vital nutrients.","Talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel asked series of dieters what gluten is .

"It is a unique musical duet - a piano piece for two players, with one played by a hologram. Japanese pianist Yoshiki performed the groundbreaking piece in Austin at the SXSW Festival. To gasps from the audience, the holographic performer appeared first - and introduced the real performer. Scroll down to see the performance . The pair played at identical see through pianos . Although the team have refused to reveal any details of the hologram, it is believed it was created using an updated version of an illusion known as 'Pepper's ghost'. The same technique was used used at Coachella to 'resurrect' slain rapper Tupac. That hologram effect was created using a system developed by London-based Musion, which employs an advanced version of Pepper's Ghost to great effect. While the traditional illusion uses light partially reflected off a pane of glass, Musion's version involves a custom-developed foil to create more believable images. 'Yoshiki unveiled a never before seen classical concert performance at FLAUNT Magazine's party celebrating its upcoming List Issuem,' the musician said on his YouTube page. 'Yoshiki mesmerized the audience at Austin's Qui as he performed a piano duel with a hologram of himself, resulting in a passionate and dramatic musical experience celebrating the artistry of the multi-talented, classically trained musician.' The musician has been experimenting with holograms for several years, long before the technology was used by more mainstream artists. It was most famously used in 20012 at the Coachella festival where Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre brought back late rapper Tupac Shakur for their headline performance. Rapper Snoop Dogg (L) and a hologram of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur perform onstage at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival in 2012 . Snoop was joined by a life-size hologram of Tupac who stunned the crowd of 75,000 fans when he appeared onstage. The bare-chested Tupac - who was dressed in sagging jeans and Timberland boots circa 1995, just like ones he wore around the time he was shot dead on September 13, 1996, aged 25. He greeted the roaring crowd saying:' What's up Coachella?' - a festival that wasn't even taking place at the time of his death - before joining Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre on hit single Hail Mary. introducing - myself! The holographic performer took to the stage to introduce his real-life playing companion . Shakur also joined Snoop for song Gangsta Party stalking around the stage in his trademark style. Both performances are believed to have been created using an updated version of an illusion known as 'Pepper's ghost'. The same technique was used used at Coachella to 'resurrect' slain rapper Tupac. That hologram effect was created using a system developed by London-based Musion, which employs an advanced version of Pepper's Ghost to great effect. While the traditional illusion uses light partially reflected off a pane of glass, Musion's version involves a custom-developed foil to create more believable images.","Artists used hologram similar to the one used to 'resurrect' rapper Tupac at Coachella Festival .

"The Dead Sea is drying up at an incredible rate leaving huge chasms of empty space in its wake. These chasms appear in the form of large, devastating sinkholes and are increasing in number throughout the region. Experts claim they are now forming at a rate of nearly one a day, but have no way of knowing when or how they will show up. The Dead Sea is drying up at an incredible rate leaving huge chasms of empty space in its wake . Estimates by Moment magazine suggest that, on the Israeli side alone, there are now over 3,000 sinkholes around the Dead Sea. This compares to just 40 counted in 1990, with the first sinkhole appearing in the 1980s. The Dead Sea spans more than 60 miles through Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan. Its waters are 10 times saltier than the northern Atlantic Ocean because it has no outlet. This means that any minerals that flow there, stay there. The Dead Sea spans more than 60 miles through Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan. Its waters are 10 times saltier than the northern Atlantic Ocean because it has no outlet. This means that any minerals that flow there, stay there . An aerial view shows a close up of a salt formation inside a large sinkhole on the shores of the Dead Sea. The increase in sinkholes is directly related to the Dead Sea drying up at a rate of one meter per year . The Dead Sea spans more than 60 miles through Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan. Its water level has fallen from 394 meters below sea level in the 1960s to about423 meters below sea level as of end 2012. As a result, the Sea’s water surface area has been reduced  by one third: from roughly 950 square kilometers to 637 square kilometers today. The water level continues  to drop at an alarming pace of 0.8 to 1.2 meters per year. The significant decline of the water level  over the past 30 years is due to diversion of water from the Jordan River and from the Dead Sea itself due to population increase. The increase in sinkholes is directly related to the Dead Sea drying up at a rate of one meter per year. Sinkholes are basically bowl-shaped features that form when an empty space under the ground creates a depression. The depression is the result of a reaction between freshwater and salt buried in a subterranean level beneath the surface. When the freshwater dissolves the salt, it creates a void, causing the landscape around and above it to suddenly collapse. Over the last few decades, increasing numbers of people have been drawn to the Dead Sea causing its salt water to dry up. This leaves more fresh water in the area to dissolve the salt and create more cavities. Sinkholes pock-mark the emerging shoreline of the Dead Sea near Ein Gedi.  The sinkholes are caused by fresh groundwater dissolving subterranean salt deposits that once formed the bottom of the Dead Sea . To bring the world's attention to Dead Sea's plight artist Spencer Tunick shot the first mass nude shoot in the Dead Sea in 2011 . One solution being presented by the World Bank is to create a canal linking the Dead Sea to either the Red Sea. But environmentalists warn that doing this could spell the end for the Dead Sea. Experts believe more needs to be done to highlight the plight of the Dead Sea and come up with a solution. For instance to bring the world's attention to the challenge artist Spencer Tunick shot the first mass nude shoot in the Dead Sea in 2011. ‘Human intervention has just about killed the Dead Sea,’ Alon Tal, professor in the Department of Desert Ecology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, told Moment magazine. ‘It will take extraordinary human measures—careful, wise intervention and positive regional cooperation—to save it.’ Estimates suggest that, on the Israeli side alone, there are now over 3,000 sinkholes around the Dead Sea .","The Dead Sea is drying up at a rate of one meter per year causing sinkholes .

"Jeremy Clarkson has told how he and his Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina under police escort as furious thugs tried to 'kill' them. Rock-throwing protesters vowed to 'barbecue' the controversial motoring show host after a row over the star's number plate boiled over. Trouble erupted after a photo of Clarkson, 54, driving a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL, circulated online, enraging Falklands War veterans who claimed it referred to the 1982 conflict. The presenter yesterday said the violent protest was 'state-organised' accusing the Argentinians of taking advantage of their visit for 'political capital'. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: A Lotus car which was used by Top Gear presenter James May is pictured with smashed windows after being pelted with stones by angry Falklands War veterans . The Top Gear team, Richard Hammond (far left), Jeremy Clarkson (second left) and James May (far right) pictured during their trip to Argentina. It is not known whether the picture was taken before or after the attack on their vehicles . He and fellow presenters Richard . Hammond and James May fled their hotel after the lobby was invaded by . angry ex-military personnel who told them to leave ‘or face the . consequences’. Staff told . how the demonstrators shouted insults until they were removed by . officers, forcing the crew to leave so hurriedly they forgot a computer. Members of the BBC2 programme's crew were pelted with stones as a jeering mob tried to attack them with pickaxe handles, Clarkson told The Sun. He said: 'I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan, but this was the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in. 'There were hundreds of them. They were hurling rocks and bricks at our cars. They were trying to attack us with pickaxe handles. 'They were even driving lorries at our convoy to force us into the crowds. They wanted to drag us out. 'They were shouting, ""Burn their cars, burn them, burn the pirates"". 'Make no mistake, they 100 per cent wanted to kill us. This is not some kind of jolly Top Gear jape - this was deadly serious.' Two members of the crew were badly injured by flying glass as their car's window was smashed by a brick. The presenters then left for the nearest . airport in order to catch the last flight to Buenos Aires, where they . boarded another plane to Chile yesterday. As he left the country last night, Clarkson said the registration plates were an 'unbelievable coincidence', and that no offence had been meant. He added: 'I am convinced the mob was state-organised. Elections are coming up and they want to look like they stood up to the English.' Clarkson took to Twitter this morning . to confirm that all of the crew had made it safely out of the country . and that he was back in the UK. He said: 'The number plate WAS a coincidence when it was pointed out to us, we changed it. 'And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths. 'They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed. 'This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong. 'We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.' Outspoken Argentinian president Christina Kirchner has long protested over the British claim to the Falkland Islands, with critics suggesting she has used the dispute to increase her waning public support. In 2013, 180 years after Britain's alleged original takeover of the Falklands, she wrote an open letter to David Cameron, calling on him to start negotiations on handing over the islands. The Prime Minister said he would 'do everything' to retain the disputed territory, and did not rule out military action. In March that year she asked the Pope, who is Argentinian, to support the country's claim for the 'Malvinas'. She told reporters how she had asked the question, but did not disclose what his answer was. She tweeted a week later that 'a three-year-old' would understand how the UK's claim on the islands was 'unsustainable'. Later in the year she used the country's temporary position on the United Nations Security Council to compare the dispute over the Falklands to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. She arrived 25 minutes late for the meeting before launching a tirade against the UK Government. This April, Argentina brought out a new 50 peso banknote - worth about £3.75 - that contained a map of the Falklands and Antonio Rivero, who led led an uprising against the British in the 1830s. Flashpoint: The Top Gear crew come under attack from a group of angry Falklands War veterans .

Abandoned: The presenters' cars were left by the side of the road before the crew fled to Chile . The attack took place in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina . The Argentinian Embassy in London was unavailable for comment this morning. A number of vehicles were abandoned, including the Porsche with the controversial plate that Clarkson was driving in the southern province of Tierra del Fuego for a special edition of the show. Richard Hammond and James May's registration plates are also thought to have angered Argentinians. They thought Hammond's Ford Mustang's plate was a reference to the number of British dead - 255 - despite the fact his plate held the number 269. May's Lotus had the number 646, which protesters took as a dig at the Argentinian fallen, even though 649 were killed in the conflict. The 25-strong crew were saved from a . second attack when they were smuggled by police and government officials . down a remote route to the border. Outspoken Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies. He was forced to apologise this year after it was claimed he mumbled the N-word while reciting a well-known children’s rhyme. In July, Ofcom ruled he deliberately used racist language by referring to an Asian man as a ‘slope’ during a Burma special. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC in 2012 about a special in which Clarkson travelled round India in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot. Clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a ‘one-eyed Scottish idiot’ in 2009. And the year before, the BBC received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. Clarkson also made a mock Nazi salute while talking about a Mini design that might be ‘quintessentially German’ and received flak after describing those who jump in front of trains as ‘Johnny Suicides’. Richard Hammond sits in his car talking to co-presenters James May and Jeremy Clarkson during filming for the Top Gear Special prior to the incident . Leading daily Clarin, predicting Clarkson was unlikely to come out unscathed, said: 'This is highly sensitive for Argentinians and he could have problems' Today a local government official said the three presenters had flown to an undisclosed destination outside of Tierra del Fuego province . Hounded out: Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters have been forced to leave Argentina early after inciting outrage among local Falklands War veterans by driving a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL . Locals used social networking sites . to comment on the convoy’s progress, with one posting the chilling . message: ‘We’re going to make a barbecue with their meat on the border.’ Another said: ‘It looks like Jeremy Clarkson got a taste of his own . medicine.’ And another labelled him a ‘British idiot’. War veteran . association member Osvaldo Hilliar said the crew had ignored strong . ‘local feeling’ about the Falklands. He added: ‘We told them we couldn’t guarantee their security if they didn’t leave.’ Despite claims by Top Gear that the choice of number plate was a coincidence, Argentine officials say it was a deliberate provocation. Local mayor Gustavo Melella vowed to make an official protest to the British Embassy in Argentina. ‘We are peace-loving people but they’ve generated the initial violence by coming to our country in the way they have,’ he said. A BBC spokesman said last night: ‘We’re pleased the team is safe and would like to thank all of those who have helped.’ Clarkson's Porsche is pictured abandoned with the offending number plate removed. The team were forced to leave Argentina three days early . The presenters, as well as members of their film crew were pelted with stones.

"A new species of predator which is a hybrid of a wolf and an Eastern coyote has been nicknamed a 'coywolf,' by scientists for its unique DNA. The wild animal has been spotted roaming around West Virginia and the land north of the Great Lakes and was created after humans forced two species to live closer together and mate. It is a hybrid of a coyote and a wolf and has about 1/4 wolf DNA, 2/3 coyote DNA and the rest of its DNA comes from domesticated dogs. Scroll down for video . Coywolf: The coywolf, pictured here, in West Virginia is a mix of a wolf and coyote . Coyote: The coyote, pictured here,   has pointier features and readily populates cities . Wolf: Genetically, the grey wolf, picture here, and the coyote are close relatives but the two animals separated evolutionarily one to two million years ago . These animals have a completely new genetic make-up and were created when previously separate wolf and coyote populations merged north of the Great Lakes. However, the coywolf is well suited to its habitat. Genetically, the grey wolf and the coyote are close relatives but the two animals separated evolutionarily one to two million years ago. Over the past decade, this new breed of animal has emerged after wolves were hunted and forced north and coyotes moved east from the Great Plains. According . to The New York Times: ‘The coywolf can be as much as 40 per cent larger . than the Western coyote, with powerful wolf-like jaws.’ It has also inherited the wolf's more social nature, which allows for pack hunting. Both animals benefit from each other’s genes. The wolf genes allow the coyote to take down bigger prey, while the coyote genes allow them to adapt to cities. Scientists have been studying the new bred of animal to learn more. They . made 50/50 hybrids in a laboratory and allowed female coyotes to mate . with grey wolves to try and emulate the coywolves genetic base. There were two failed pregnancies and one litter of six puppies. And the hybrids appeared to be better at dealing with hard times. Scientists breed: These animals  are  50/50 hybrids made in a laboratory to try and emulate the coywolves genetic base . Experiment: There were two failed pregnancies and one litter of six puppies among the breed, like this one pictured, made in the laboratory . For example, when food is sparse, they'll forage for it, adapting to changing situations. Altogether, they tend to do better than their parent species who are not hybrids. Scientists suggest that the emergence of the coywolves, illustrates how human activity often takes away the barriers that separate species. Another huge factor is the effect that climate change is having on animals' natural habitats. The Arctic is warming between two and four times as fast as the rest of the planet forcing animals’ natural habitats to  change. As they move, it can lead to more interbreeding.","The wild animal has been spotted roaming around West Virginia and in the land north of the Great Lakes .

"Weston Golf Club in Massachusetts is usually a haven of tranquility and decorum – but the police had to be called when a huge row erupted over members committing the cardinal sin of wearing denim. At the center of the uproar was the club’s president, Tom Ferry, and British couple Stephen and Charlotte Weeple. He is said to have directed a barrage of expletive-laden insults at them as they entered the 120-year-old club because he thought they were wearing denim – a material that is outlawed even in designer form. Weston Golf Club in Massachusetts is usually a haven of tranquility and decorum - but the peace was shattered in September when a row erupted over members wearing jeans . The website of the club, set in Boston’s affluent western suburbs, states that only neat white denim is allowed, and even then only women can wear it. It says that ‘all denim attire including blue jeans, designer jeans and denim jackets or dresses, regardless of color’ is prohibited. It adds that ‘women may wear neat, not torn, “white denim” or “5 pocket style slacks” in any color (other than blue denim)’. Mr Weeple, an executive at a Boston finance company, and his wife had arrived for an evening drink with a large group of members who were also accused of violating the dress code, though it’s not clear precisely how. The verbal altercation between the group and Mr Ferry one Saturday night in September became so heated that the police were called amid reports of a fist fight, according to The Boston Globe. Rules: Only 'neat white denim' is allowed at Weston Golf Club . Patrolman Joseph Kozowyk said in his report that when he arrived he ‘observed two men… engaged in a loud, verbal argument’. He added that ‘neither man had any signs of a physical altercation’. The extraordinary incident ended when the Weeples, originally from the Edinburgh area, left the club. However, that was far from the end of the matter. Mrs Weeple wrote a letter to the club’s board, obtained by the Boston Globe, complaining that Mr Ferry called her derogatory names and denying that she’d broken the dress rules. She wrote: ‘Having spent much of my life in golf clubs around Scotland and officers’ clubs in the military… I am fully aware and respectful of dress code and etiquette’. Mr Ferry was so mortified over his behavior that he issued a grovelling apology to The Boston Globe. He said: ‘I am sorry that the ongoing discord over enforcement of the club’s policies has reached such an embarrassing level. Most importantly I wish to repeat publicly the apology I gave to the people with whom I interacted outside of the club that night. It was wrong of me to have spoken that way, I have no excuse, and I sincerely regret having done so.’ He offered to resign for a month, but he left permanently this month following a petition organized by disgruntled club members over the incident. Five couples in the club with the Weeples were subsequently suspended for wearing jeans or violating the dress code in other ways. • All denim attire including blue jeans, designer jeans and denim jackets or dresses, regardless of color, provided, however, women may wear neat, not torn, “white denim” or “5 pocket style slacks” in any color (other than blue denim) anywhere on the Club grounds other than the golf course or golf practice areas. • Cargo shorts or cargo pants. • Short shorts or cutoffs. • Collarless tee shirts, tank tops and similar clothing in all areas except the pool. • Tee shirts and bathing suits in all areas except the pool. • Hooded sweatshirts, other sweatshirts and sweatpants in all areas except the pool. • Torn or ripped clothing. Clubhouse: Jackets are preferred in the Grill Room at dinner. Shirttails must be tucked in. Men’s and Boys’ Appropriate Attire: . • Collared shirts. Mock turtlenecks are acceptable. • Shirts must be tucked in. • Slacks or Bermuda-length shorts. If there are belt-loops, belts must be worn. • Hats worn with brim facing forward. Ladies’ and Girls’ Appropriate Attire: . • Conventional golf shirts and dress tee shirts. • Shirts must have a collar or sleeves. • Slacks or Bermuda-length shorts or skirts. Shorts and skirts must fall no higher than 4” above the knee. If there are belt-loops, belts must be worn.

"Looking as impeccable as the Queen clearly takes some effort - and she certainly doesn't travel light. A van crammed with shoes, hat boxes and bagged dresses accompanied her as she arrived in Scotland today. After the royal couple, who were celebrating their 67th wedding anniversary with a trip to Moray, had been driven away from Elgin Station, staff quickly unloaded the royal train and ferried a succession of boxes to the waiting vehicle. The items were all labelled with yellow tags with 'The Queen' written on them. A number of suitcases were also packed into the vehicle which followed the Queen, who was resplendent in lavender Karl Ludwig and a hat by Angela Kelly, as she travelled to RAF Lossiemouth.

Today's look: The Queen wore an elegant lilac ensemble by Karl Ludwig and a matching hat by Angela Kelly . The Queen was welcomed by Lieutenant Colonel Grenville Johnston, the Lord Lieutenant of Moray, on the platform as she arrived in Elgin . Mothers with young children then greeted the Queen after she stepped off the train . Nice to meet you: The Queen looked delighted when a little boy approached clutching a posy of flowers for her . Hello there: The adorable little boy looked almost as thrilled to meet the Queen as she did to see him . Earlier, the Queen was all smiles as she was welcomed by Lieutenant Colonel Grenville Johnston, the Lord Lieutenant of Moray, on the platform at Elgin Station. The monarch's smile grew even broader when a little boy approached clutching a bouquet of flowers, which she happily accepted before spending several minutes chatting to the child and his mother. Prince Philip, who is fresh from a visit to Germany where he presented service medals to troops returning from Afghanistan, also looked on fine form, smiling broadly as he met well-wishers, many of whom were waving Union flags. The royal couple had arrived in Elgin ahead of a visit RAF Lossiemouth and the neighbouring Kinross Barracks, where the Queen unveiled a plaque at the new purpose-built Quick Reaction Alert facility. Once there, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were welcomed with a flypast, which included two Typhoons and a Tornado jet, following a parade inside the aircraft hangar which also saw them inspect personnel from No.1 (Fighter) Squadron. It was the Queen’s first visit to the base since 2003 and formally recognised the transfer of the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) facility from RAF Leuchars to Lossiemouth. The facility is one of two in Britain that stands ready to scramble jets to intercept any unidentified aircraft in northern airspace. The other is at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. A warm welcome: The Queen is greeted by Pipe Major Ryan Anderson after arriving at Elgin rail station . Visit: The Queen was in Elgin ahead of a visit to RAF Lossiemouth which was once the home of the 617 Dambusters Squadron . Busy: The trip to Scotland comes in the midst of a busy week for the royals, with Prince Philip spending yesterday in Germany . Slow journey: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh travelled to Scotland on the Royal Train . The Queen and Prince Philip, who were married on November 20 1947, travelled overnight from London on the Royal Train to Elgin and were then driven to nearby Lossiemouth, where they met pilots and their families, including eight-year-old Lennon Gallagher, who gave the monarch a second posy. The Lossiemouth schoolboy said he knew it was their wedding anniversary but was not nervous to hand over the flowers, made up with colours from the RAF Lossiemouth tartan, to mark the visit. 'I got the day off school to give the Queen flowers,' he explained. 'She said ""thank you, they’re so beautiful"".' His father, Corporal Brendan Gallagher, added: 'We were told (about the visit) last month but we had to keep it quiet because Lennon didn’t know. 'We knew he’d be super excited and want to tell people in school if we told him too early, so we only told him the other day. It’s been great, we’re so proud of him.' One of the oldest Royal Air Force bases in Britain, RAF Lossiemouth began life in 1938 and first saw active service during World War Two when it became the base for No. 15 Flying Training School before being handed over to Bomber Command in 1940. More introductions: The Queen was met by Lieutenant Colonel Grenville Johnston on the platform at Elgin Station . Ravishing: The Queen looked wonderful in a pretty lilac ensemble and her trademark Launer London 'Judy' handbag . All smiles: The Queen seemed pleased to meet her welcome party who stood at the station waiting her arrival . Although much of the work done at the base involved training bomber crews, it was also the home of the famous Dambusters squadron, which launched the successful raid on the German battleship Tirpitz from the base in 1944. Now home to three combat squadrons as well as 'D-Flight' which operates Sea King search and rescue helicopters, it remains one of the busiest RAF bases in Britain. Most recently, Typhoon aircraft based at Lossiemouth had to be scrambled after a Russian Bear Bomber approached UK air space at the beginning of the month. The Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-95 aircraft were tracked as they flew across the North Sea before being intercepted by RAF pilots, who escorted them out of British airspace. Wing Commander Mike Sutton said: 'QRA is one of the most critical roles that the UK military has. It is made up with Typhoon aircraft permanently on standby to launch at very short notice, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to assist aircraft in distress or for any incursions on UK airspace that we need to investigate. 'Today is an enormous day for RAF Lossiemouth and we’re delighted to be hosting Her Majesty. As you can see we have lots of families visiting today and there’s a real good feeling on the station.' Here she comes! Her Majesty's silhouette could be seen from inside the train carriage as she approached the exit . All smiles: Both halves of the royal couple looked in good health and on fine form as they arrived at the Scottish station .

"A Staten Island Catholic school is reeling after allegations the athletic director turned a blind eye to affairs female members of staff were having with teenage students. The NYPD has began an investigation at the $8,000 a year Moore Catholic High School, after gym teacher, Megan Mahoney, 25, is alleged to have been caught in a months-long affair with a 16-year-old member of the basketball team. Athletic director, Richard Postiglione, is accused of failing to report any suspicions of sexual misconduct at the school after first being told in 2006 that affairs between students and teachers were carrying on. According to the New York Post, Mahoney, who also acted as the assistant athletic director at the school, would pick up the 16-year-old boy in her car and drive him to secluded parts of Staten Island, where they would conduct their trysts. 'We would just drive around and do it in the car,' said the boy to the Post. The teen, whose name is being withheld, added that at no point did the two ever discuss the illegal nature of their relationship. 'We were never boyfriend-girlfriend,' he said. 'It was cool. I knew it wasn’t going anywhere. I told my best friend and like three kids.' Alleged: Megan Mahoney is accused of having at least one affair with one of the teenage boys at Moore Catholic School in Staten Island . Mahoney was questioned by police after the teens ex-girlfriend followed them one day to a diner in January and phoned 911. The teacher has denied having a sexual affair with the student. Athletic director Richard Postiglione is accused of covering-up affairs . However, the boy's parents told the New York Post that they saw their son and Mahoney together and assumed she was a student. 'She looks young,' said the father. 'You'd never know.' The allegations of a cover-up center around what Postiglione knew about the alleged illegal affair. 'Richie knew all about it,' an anonymous source told the New York Post. They alleged that they were told about the affair by the teenagers best friend and that he then told school principal, Bob Manisero. 'Bob told me Postiglione had investigated and there was no truth to it. He told me she came from an upstanding Catholic family. But there was notorious gossip all over the school. These boys didn’t keep quiet.' According to the Post, the same source emailed Postiglione and the school board chairman, Anthony Ferreri in December and told then of their concerns about the alleged affair. 'If you remember I had reported some activity some time ago about a basketball coach that I had learned,' the December 19, 2013 email reads according to the Post. 'Rich thought it was untrue even though I knew it was correct…I was told they are in LOVE…Hope you have followed legal protocol to report even when there is no witness.' Concern: Rumors of covered up affairs between teachers and students at Moore High School have been ride for years . The Post alleges that Postiglione, Manisero and Ferreri were all aware of the supposed affair, but did not inform child-protection authorities. It is believed though, that Postiglione confronted Mahoney about the alleged affair and made her end it. After the alleged affair was outed in January, the teen was subject to appalling treatment at school, his mother alleges. 'They wanted to get rid of my son, get him out of the school,' said the boy's mom. Initial investigations by the Post allege that Mahoney had an affair with another 16-year-old boy in 2012 and Postiglione knew of another affair in 2006 or 2007 and did not report it.","Megan Mahoney, 25, is alleged to have had at least one affair with teen student at Moore Catholic High School .

"The wife of Olympic ski champ Bode Miller has implied that the mother of his son fished a condom out of the trash to get pregnant. Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player, apparently made the bizarre accusation in a chat room for a pregnancy website  - just days after Miller and his ex reached a settlement in the bitter custody battle for their 18-month-old son. 'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom,' read the November 18 post on TheBump.com, PageSix first reported. In an earlier post, she also revealed that she is 13 weeks pregnant. Accusations: Morgan Beck (right), who is married to skier Bode Miller, has suggested his son was conceived after his then-girlfriend Sara McKenna (left) fished a condom out of the trash . Together: Bode Miller smiles with his son, whom he calls Nate - even though McKenna calls him Sam . The claims were made under the username '2015mamatobe', which used a photo showing Morgan Beck and Miller together. The photo and the posts have since been removed. Miller and his ex, Sara McKenna, had a son together after meeting through a matchmaking service in 2012. McKenna calls the little boy Sam while Miller calls him Nathaniel, after his late brother. Last week, they finally reached a settlement following a lengthy custody battle, but the details have not been released. After the posts appeared on TheBump earlier this week, McKenna also joined the website to stand up for herself, verifying it was her by sharing screen grabs of her email account. She asked other forum members to send her anything '2015mamatobe' might have said about her online, and said that posts the user had written about 'daily random things' match Beck's life. She also dismissed the suggestion that she had used a used condom to get pregnant. 'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida,' she wrote, adding: 'This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.' Accusations: A user called 'GraceinCA' shared messages she had received from another user - believed to be Beck - with the name '2015mamatobe' on TheBump.com earlier this week . Together: The image for '2015mamatobe' shows Beck pictured with Miller, whom she married last year . With dad: Sam is pictured with Miller and Beck, who has apparently since removed her messages . McKenna has previously said she and Miller did not use a condom at all when they conceived Sam. 'He never offered to use a condom,' she told the New York Daily News last year. 'He assumed I was ready to get pregnant.' Posting other messages on the website, '2015mamatobe' said she was just over 13 weeks pregnant. 'I really want/wanted to keep the news of my pregnancy quiet for now,' the user wrote on November 10, explaining that last time news of her pregnancy went public, she miscarried. 'Living that publicly was really hard. I don't mind if people know who we are (as if anyone would really care), but my family just has personal reasons for not wanting to be identified quite yet,' she said. Morgan Beck miscarried a child with Miller in early 2013. She has not yet returned a request for comment. As well as Sam, Miller also has an older daughter from a previous relationship. Truce: McKenna, pictured left outside court in December 2013, and Miller, right with Beck outside court in April, finally reached a custody agreement over the 18-month-old boy last week following the lengthy battle . After McKenna, then a firefighter, fell pregnant, Miller said he did not want to raise the boy together, and they moved their separate ways. At seven months pregnant, McKenna moved from California to New York to attend Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, while he married volleyball player Morgan Beck. McKenna said she told him of her plans in a text message but he never responded. But two weeks after Sam was born in February 2013, Miller filed for custody in California and she temporarily lost custody of him, McKenna recounted in an essay for Cosmopolitan. It came just a month after Miller, now 37, and his wife Morgan, 27, experienced a miscarriage. In September last year, a judge gave Miller full custody of Sam, calling McKenna's move to New York 'irresponsible' and 'irreprehensible'. Record breaking: Bode Miller, a five-time world champion, is pictured competing at Sochi in February. He underwent back surgery on Monday but hopes to be back to the sport by next January . After losing Sam, McKenna's life turned into a 'nightmare' and she quit school and her job, she said. But she soon realized that being 'catatonic wasn't helping matters' so she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a way to get Sam back for good, she said in Cosmo. McKenna also tracked her son's life with Miller on her ex and his new wife's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him 'Nathaniel', after Miller's late brother. 'That was really heartbreaking,' she wrote. 'Our son's name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. Calling him anything else is just confusing.' The next time she saw her son was at a court hearing in November where she won back custody. She is now studying law in the hope of helping others going through the same ordeal. Miller, a five-time world champion, still lives in California with his wife. He underwent minor back surgery on Monday but has said he hopes to be back to the sport by January.","A user who appears to be Miller's wife Morgan Beck posted the comments on a pregnancy website's chat room earlier this week .

"Prince Harry made his first visit to a mosque today on the final day of his whirlwind tour of Oman. The fourth in line to the throne was visiting the breath-taking Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in the capital Muscat, which can accommodate up to 20,000 worshippers at any one time. Dressed in a smart blue suit, Harry slipped off his shoes in accordance with religious custom as he was given a tour of the spectacular marble-floored complex by a member of the Diwan – or Royal Court - Higher Centre for Culture and Science. Scroll down for video . In accordance with religious tradition, he slipped off his shoes for the tour. The Mosque was a gift to the nation of Oman from its ruler, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, to mark the 30th year of his reig . Harry peppered his guide with questions throughout the half-hour long tour and smiled at pictures of his father, Prince Charles, on a visit to the mosque last year that had been displayed in its library . The prince looked fascinated as he was talked through the history of the mosque and the mammoth effort that it took to build it. The Mosque was a gift to the nation of Oman from its ruler, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, to mark the 30th year of his reign. Built from 300,000 tonnes of Indian sandstone, the main musalla – or prayer hall - has a central dome rising to a height of 164 feet (50 metres) above the floor. Its main minaret, which rises 295 feet (90 metres) and four flanking towers, can be seen across the city. The mosque also boasts the world's second largest hand-woven carpet and chandelier.

The prayer carpet measures 229 feet by 196 feet and covers the entire floor of the main hall. It is remarkable not only because it is is made from a single piece of cloth but because it contains 1.7 billion knots, weighs 21 tonnes and took 400 female weavers four years to produce. Its weavers incorporated 28 different colours in a variety of shades, the majority obtained from traditional vegetable dyes. The building's majestic Swarovski crystal chandelier, which hangs above the praying hall, is equally impressive. It is a staggering 45 feet tall, weighs eight tonnes and has 1122 lights inside that take two days to change, twice a year. In all, it took six years to complete the 416,000 square metre site, which opened to the public in 2001. Harry peppered his guide with questions throughout the half-hour long tour and smiled at pictures of his father, Prince Charles, on a visit to the mosque last year that had been displayed in its library. Harry's visit caused great excitement among a group of American tourists who were also visiting . The ever-obliging Harry also stopped to pose for selfies with a group of excited school children . His visit, which was unannounced, caused waves of excitement among a group of American tourists who happened to be there, while a group of schoolchildren squealed with delight each time he walked past and jumped in front of the prince to pose for spur-of-the-moment selfies. Walking out through the spacious gardens bisected by water channels, Harry thanked his guide and headed straight off in his convoy to the international airport to fly onto Abu Dhabi. This afternoon he will play in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club attended by celebrities including Geri Halliwell and Dan Stevens. The match is in aid of the charity he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, following a gap year visit to the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho. The name Sentebale means 'forget me not' in the local dialect, Basotho. The trip to the mosque was the final stop on Harry's tour of Oman and he will now fly to Abu Dhabi . The magnificent mosque is one of Muscat - and Oman's - top tourist destinations . Lesotho is a tiny, poverty-stricken country with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world. Sentebale supports the many thousands of children affected by the epidemic both directly and though losing their families to the disease. Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV. The Sentebale Cup, which is in its fifth year, is helping to support the Mamohato Programme, which address the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV as well as working to reduce the stigma linked to the disease and helping to markedly improve their quality of life. Harry, who plans to make a visit to some of the charity's project next month, has said he hopes to expand its work to other countries in Africa. Harry plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after the official elements of the trip have concluded today to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit, which is on this weekend.

"A mixed martial arts fighter in New Mexico may face charges after authorities say he fended off four home invaders - killing one and severely injuring another - during a an early morning break in on New Year's Day. According to authorities in Dora Ana County, MMA fighter Joe Torrez fatally beat and stabbed one of the intruders, beat another so badly he needed to be taken from Torrez's home in an ambulance and then convinced the other two to retreat in fear. Authorities found the body of 25-year-old Sal Garces near Torrez's trailer home in the 600 block of King James Avenue. Fighter: Joe Torrez allegedly killed an an intruder and fought off three others in a home invasion gone wrong . New Years: Torrez was home with his young son and fiance when the intruders burst into his home early New Years Day . Garces, his 19-year-old brother Raymond Garces, 20-year-old Nathan Avalos and 22-year-old Leonard Calvillo forced their way into 27-year-old Torrez's house about 2 a.m. on New Year's day. Once inside the home, a fight began between the intruders and Torrez - a fight that ended with Garces dead, Avalos being admitted to a hospital with 'severe' facial injuries and the other two fleeing the scene. The younger Garces and Calvillo were arrested shortly after the altercation, while Avalos was taken into custody at the hospital. Gangster: Raymond Garces is a longtime criminal and known gang member, according to police . Threat: Leonard Calvillo threatened Torrez in a phone call before storming into his home with his three friends . What led to the fatal fight are unclear, but Raymond Garces told police the group had gone to Torrez's home after a previous altercation, according to court documents first obtained by Las Cruces Sun News. Court records claim that Torrez was in the home with his young son, fiance and friends when his fiance's sister arrived claiming to have been 'jumped.' Torrez then received a threatening call from Calvillo. 'I'm big Eastside,' Calvillo reportedly said, referring to a gang. '... I'll kill you and your family ... I will go to your house.' Each of the four intruders, authorities said, are known gang members. Shortly after the threatening phone call, the people inside heard a 'huge bang outside.' Within a matter of seconds the four intruders were in the house. Bad move: Sal Garces was found stabbed and beaten to death near Torrez's home . One of the men, a witness told police, was armed with a 'crude shank.' Another grabbed a knife after entering the home. An attorney for Torrez, C.J. McElhinney, says his client was acting in self-defense when he fought off the intruders. 'He was fighting for his life,' said McElhinney. After the fight, Raymond Garces and Calvillo fled, authorities said. Las Cruces police helped deputies locate and arrest them, according to a news release. Both men face several felony charges. Avalos has not been charged, but the case is still under investigation. Calvillo has been charged with aggravated battery, two counts of conspiracy and criminal damage to property. Raymond Garces was charged with two counts of conspiracy and criminal damage to . property. He was being held at the detention center on a $10,000 secured . bond. Authorities haven't ruled out charging Torrez with any crimes. A Facebook page has been setup in support of the MMA fighter.","The intruders were known gang members with lengthy criminal records .

"A Fort Worth, Texas man’s pregnant wife is on life support and he wants her taken off even though the move would also leave their baby dead. Erick Munoz says his wife Marlise, 33, who hasn’t regained consciousness since suffering an embolism in November, would not have wanted to live life hooked up to a machine. The life of the unborn baby, which may have already suffered irreparable damage, now hangs in the balance and Munoz says doctors should fulfill her wishes--which would end the lives of both his wife and their unborn child. Happier times: Erick Munoz (right, holding their 1-year-old son Mateo) says his wife Marlise (left) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine. But because she is pregnant, Texas law requires she receive all life saving measures . 'I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders . But in Texas, doctors must take all . life saving measures to preserve the life of an unborn baby, which in . this case remains too immature to survive outside the womb. That means doctors' hands—along with Erick’s—are tied. ‘I don't agree with this law,’ Erick told ABC News as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1-year-old son Mateo. Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. Erick says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation. And this isn’t it. ‘We knew what her wishes were,’ Erick, who found his wife unconscious on their kitchen floor and fought in vain to resuscitate her, told WFAA. However, Marlise’s wishes don’t matter. Per Texas state law: ‘A person may . not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter . from a pregnant patient.’ The . couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive . by a machine and hadn’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order. But that wouldn’t have made a difference. Texas . gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother’s wishes even when a . DNR has been signed, where the state’s form reads, ‘I understand under . Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as . pregnant.’ Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness . 'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines . Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when Marlise's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period . That means Marlise and Erick’s baby will likely be taken to full term, or for as long as it appears safe for the fetus to remain in the womb. Now at 18 weeks, the fetus still cannot be safely delivered. Only at 24 to 28 weeks would doctors deem it safe to deliver via cesarean. For now, doctors say the baby has a normal heartbeat, though it remains unknown how it was affected when Marlise’s brain was deprived of oxygen. ‘They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,’ Erick told ABC. ‘But I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead.’ Munoz says that, though he doesn’t agree with the law, he’s not interested in fighting a protracted legal battle. 'It's hard to reach the point where you wish your wife's body would stop,' he said. 'They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen,' Erick said . Normal heartbeat: For now, the baby in Marlise's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term . 'I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead': Though he doesn't agree with the laws, Erick says he's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle .","Erick Munoz of Fort Wort, Texas found his wife Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor on November 26 .
Marlise was 14 weeks pregnant at the time, too early in the pregnancy for the baby to survive outside the mother .
She remains on life support because Texas law forbids any action that would harm an unborn child in such cases .

"As the future of their show lies in doubt, the Duck Dynasty clan are still making millions thanks to their megabucks Walmart merchandising deal, MailOnline can today reveal. The Robertson family has a merchandise empire that is estimated by Forbes to be worth about $400million - and their deal with Walmart makes up around half of this. And today, as Walmart refused to comment on the future of their relationship with the TV family, just one glimpse at the chainstore's website shows fans are flocking to buy Duck Dynasty merchandise amid the furor over patriach Phil Robertson's homophobic comments. Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal a publicist from A&E DID accompany Phil to his interview with GQ magazine -but was NOT there when he made his incendiary comments. Off air: A&E network have suspended Duck Dynasty patriach Phill Robertson from the hit show following his homophobic comments in GQ magazine . Best Seller: Duck Dynasty products have sold out on the Walmart website following Phil Robertson's explosive comments . Out of stock: Walmart has a multi-million merchandising deal with A&E networks for Duck Dynasty. It's believed to be worth nearly half their $400million merchandising empire . Walmarts sells a huge array of Duck Dynasty merchandise- from T-shirts to camo bedding, posters, watches, toy trucks, camo chairs, clothing, jewellery and even bottle openers. Today, as Phil Robertson's close-knit family insisted they would not film the hit A&E show without him following his suspension by the network, fans tweeted they were rushing to Walmart. However, others pointed out that this support merely puts more money into A&E's pockets as well, with one tweeting: 'Loving that Tea People are rushing to Walmart to Duck Dynasty swag in protest of A& who OWNS the merchandising.' Another added: 'I better rush off to Walmart and buy up all the Phil Robertson merchandise 'cuz it's gonna be a collectors item one day.' Another tweet read: 'Your stores may look quite vacant when you pull down the Duck Dynasty merch. May want to double down on the Honey Boo Boo.' A Walmart spokeswoman declined to comment. Family support: The Robertson clan have threatened to quit the hit-rated show. In a statement, they said: 'As a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm' Close-knit: Phil Robertson and his wife Kay have spawned the Duck Dynasty clan that have made A&E network millions . Empire: Walmart sells everything you can think of for Duck Dynasty fans - from bedspreads to watches and bottle openers . Walmart announced at their annual shareholders meeting that the best-selling item of apparel for both men and women this year was the reality show's T-shirt, according to Forbes. Forbes writer Claire O'Connor said: 'When I was down in Arkansas for this Walmart meeting, you really do marvel at the amount of people who are wearing these Duck Dynasty T-shirts and hats. 'There are kids pajamas, there is camo bedding and you probably won't be surprised to hear that they sell Duck Dynasty prayer devotionals.' This also includes the No. 1 country album on Billboard for the month of November, Duck the Halls. She added that even though Walmart had dumped Paula Deen over her racism row, it was 'still early' with regards to Duck Dynasty, saying: 'I think for this demographic, anti-gay rhetoric is not considered as much of a huge sin as racism. 'The ball is in Walmart's court. They are going to have to make some sort of decision on this. The only way this retail empire will be at stake is if Walmart decides they are not going to sell these items anymore and I really cannot see that happening. Other smaller brands will probably wait for Walmart to take the lead on this.' Meanwhile, a source revealed a publicist from Duck Dynasty was there when Phil was interviewed for the January issue of GQ. Support: Fans are still buying Duck Dynasty merchandise . Collectors: Fans joked about snapping up Duck Dynasty gear . Jokes: Walmart's deal with the Robertson clan is said to be worth nearly half their $400million merchandising haul . However, the interview took place in . several locations and the publicist did not accompany the GQ journalist . and Phil when they went for a ride on ATVs. The source said: 'A&E sent . a publicist for the duration of the interview, but she was not there . for the 'anus v vagina' comment. But to be honest, Phil was making . similar comments throughout the interview and it's not like he wouldn't . have said it in front of her. 'It was just that they were riding ATVs and the publicist was not there for that specific moment.' This . means that A&E would have been aware of the sentiment of Phil's . interview - and could have been pre-warned of the scandal that erupted . when he called being gay a sin, adding: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina . -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man’s anus. 'That’s . just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to . offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: . It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' As A&E today remained quiet, it was reported the network still plans to make hay from the show. TMZ reported that Duck Dynasty is taking over A&E's Christmas schedule. The network will air four separate rerun marathons of the show in four days - from December 22 until 25, totalling 33.5 hours of airtime. Following Phil's suspension from the program, the Robertson family released a statement reading: 'We want to thank all of you for your prayers and support. The family has spent much time in prayer since learning of A&E's decision. 'We want you to know that first and foremost we are a family rooted in our faith in God and our belief that the Bible is His word. While some of Phil’s unfiltered comments to the reporter were coarse, his beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible. Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart” and “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Prayers: Willie Robertson's daughter Sadie tweeted her thanks . Phil would never incite or encourage . hate. We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for . expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right. 'We . have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a . family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch . at the helm.

Princess Charlene, 36, who has chosen to find out the babies genders, is under strict instructions not to tell him. 'The princess probably knows but she is playing the game,' said the expectant father. 'She is keeping the secret as I asked her to.' 'You know, one doesn't often have the opportunity to have such pleasant surprises in life. That is why I prefer not to know the babies' gender before the birth.' The pregnant princess (pictured in September, left, and during a trip to America last month, right) has said: 'The prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical, so powerful' Princess Charlene showed off her baby bump alongside Prince Albert at the Princess Grace Foundation Cocktail Reception in Los Angeles last month . Prince Albert has two children from previous relationships - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, 22, and son Alexandre Coste, 10 - but neither are able to inherit the throne as both were born out of wedlock. For her part, Princess Charlene is said to be looking forward to becoming a mother for the first time and described her pregnancy as 'magical'. And it is not just the couple themselves who are eagerly awaiting the birth. Earlier this week, Charlene's parents - who have set up a temporary residence in Monaco in preparation for twins' arrival - spoke of their excitement. Mike Wittstock described the feeling as 'amazing'. Speaking to French publication Point de vue, he also said that despite their royal status he intends to treat the twins as normally as possible. 'I will respect everything required by the protocol, my daughter knows that, but other than that they will be treated in the same way as their cousins.'","Prince Albert and Princess Charlene expecting twins .

"The mysteries of the Nazca Lines carved into the Peruvian desert have intensified after gales and sandstorms revealed previously unseen ancient designs. A pilot discovered a geoglyph of what appears to be a 196ft-long (60 metre) snake, as well as a type of camelid - such as a llama - above an unidentified bird. These new lines join existing geoglyphs of a dog, hummingbird, condor and a monkey, thought to have been drawn by the ancient Nazca people between the first and sixth centuries. Scroll down for video . The new lines were revealed following gales and sandstorms in the region and researchers believe this geoglyph shows a camelid (outlined left) above an unidentified bird (outlined right). Some 700 geoglyphs are thought to have been drawn by the ancient Nazca people between the first and sixth centuries . The discovery was made by pilot Eduardo Herrán Gómez de la Torre as he flew over the hills of El Ingenio Valley and Pampas de Jumana, as reported by El Comercio. Archaeologists are now working to confirm the authenticity of the lines. The geoglyphs, more commonly known as the Nazca Lines, were first spotted from the air in 1939 when a pilot flew over the Nazca region of the Peruvian coastal highlands. They were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, and the area stretches more than 50 miles (80km) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, 248 miles (400km) south of Lima. Another previously unseen geoglyph (pictured) appears to reveal a 196ft-long (60 metre) snake. The discovery was made by pilot Eduardo Herrán Gómez de la Torre as he flew over the hills of Pampas de Jumana . Most of the lines (the dog is pictured) are formed by a shallow trench with a depth of between four inches (10cm) and six inches (15cm). They were made by removing the reddish-brown iron oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca desert and exposing the light-coloured earth beneath . The mystery about why they were created has been debated for decades. One theory is that the geoglyphs are connected in some way to water. For example, a triangular geoglyph at the bottom of the Cerro Blanco mountain runs along the water veins inside the mountain, while the condor geoglyph is linked to local legend, which states that when the condor flies over the mountain, ‘great rains follow’. Similarly, the ‘hummingbird’ geoglyph only appears in the summer following heavy rainfall. All of the drawings were said to have been drawn using a single line, that never crosses itself, and were believed to be an appeal to the gods to bring rain. The geoglyphs, more commonly known as the Nazca Lines, were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the Nasca planes of the Peruvian coastal highlands. They were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles (80km) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, about 400 km south of Lima. Some 700 geoglyphs are thought to have been drawn by the ancient Nazca people between the first and sixth centuries. The Nazca Lines are drawn into lighter coloured strata which contrasts with darker gravels on the plain. In general terms, the geoglyphs fall into two categories: the first group, of which about 70 have been identified, are said to represent natural objects, such as animals, birds and insects.

The monkey is pictured . Many of the images also appeared on pottery and textiles of the region. Other drawings represent flowers, plants, and trees. A second is made from lines and more basic shapes such as spirals, triangle and rectangles. Archaeological surveys have found wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines, which support theory the ancient people used simple tools and surveying equipment to construct the lines. Most of the lines are formed by a shallow trench with a depth of between four inches (10cm) and six inches (15cm), made by removing the reddish-brown iron oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca desert and exposing the light-coloured earth beneath. The largest geoglyph is a 935ft-long (285 metre) pelican (pictured). Most of the lines are formed by a shallow trench with a depth of between four inches (10cm) and six inches (15cm), made by removing the iron oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca desert to expose the light-coloured earth beneath . This sublayer contains high amounts of lime which has down the years hardened to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds and prevents erosion. Contrary to the popular belief that the figures can only be seen from the air, they are actually visible from the surrounding foothills. Paul Kosok, from Long Island University, is credited as the first scholar to seriously study the Nazca Lines. He discovered that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. Along with Maria Reiche, a German mathematician and archaeologist, Kosok proposed the figures were markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose. Source: UNESCO . Experts believe the Nazca used to dance along the lines of the geoglyphs when they prayed for rain - and many of the same images appear on Nazca pottery. In December 2012, Professor Clive Ruggles, of the University of Leicester, said one of the shapes - a spiral motif traced in the Peruvian desert - is likely to have been a labyrinth, created as a ‘spiritual path’. The huge images, which include hundreds of animals and complex mazes in the Nazca desert, can only clearly be seen for the air giving rise to a number of explanations as to who they were intended for.

"A small Alabama community got the shock of the season on Saturday when a group of scantily clad gay African American Santas took their Christmas parade route by storm. The Prancing Elites, an all gay dance team known for their provocative moves and outfits, were confused by the invitation to walk the Semmes, Alabama (population 3,000) Christmas parade but swayed and thrust their way through outraged crowds nonetheless. Parade organizers have since apologized for including the Prancing Elites, but the five gentlemen from Mobile think it was all just part of a day’s work. Scroll down for videos... Prancing Elites: A dance team of gay black men has caused a furor in the small town of Semmes, Alabama after appearing in their Christmas parade Saturday . Shock and awe: The dance team has angered the residents of the town of 3,000 with their lurid Santa outfits and provocative hip-hop moves . ‘It felt like a regular event,’ dance team leader Kentrell Collins, 26, told AL.com. ‘We were taking a risk, but we always do.’ The team arrived to Semmes and lined up ready to march in fur-trimmed, snug-fitting Santa outfits. Even as the gentleman, in full makeup and Santa hats, stripped off their sweat pants at the parade start, they raised some eyebrows. ‘I had no idea that they would be dressed the way they were and that they would think it's appropriate for a community Christmas parade,’ said Karen McDuffie, who helped plan the event. ‘Their costumes and the style of dancing were inappropriate.’ The team specializes in J-Setting, a lead and follow style hip-hop dance style that involves movements some may find lurid or provocative. As they strutted their stuff through the parade’s 1.7 mile stretch, many of those raised eyebrows deepened into scorn. 'We were taking a risk, but we always do': The team got some confused and even scornful looks, but they saw its all in a day's work . Prancing on: The Prancing Elites gained notoriety last summer after Shaquille O'Neal shared a video of them on Twitter. They've since had multiple national TV appearances . 'Vulgar': Parade officials say they began getting irate phone calls from community members within hours of the parade . McDuffie told AL.com the team’s dancing was ‘vulgar’ and ‘not appropriate for a children's Christmas parade.’ She said outraged community members began to vent in phone calls and social media feeds within hours of the event and apologized on behalf of organizers. Suzanne Massingill, an advisor to the Prancing Elites, told AL.com that the group was under the, apparently mistaken, impression McDuffie had seen them on YouTube. Meanwhile, the Prancing Elites themselves are not apologizing on behalf of anyone. ‘It's OK for a woman to put on tights and play football but when a man wants to put on leotard and tights, it's a problem,’ said Collins. ‘We are no different than any team out there dancing. We want people to stop looking at gender and focus on the talent.’ Not your average parade: The dance group is based in nearby Mobile, Alabama, where residents may have been a little less surprised than they were in small Semmes . While many of the folks of Semmes were unable to appreciate it, the Prancing Elites’ talents have been acknowledge in some notable places. In June, Shaquille O'Neal took a liking one of their videos and tweeted it out. The video quickly gained some 200,000 views in just two days. Since then, the group—which consists of Collins, Adrian Clemons, 23, Jerel Maddox, 23, Kareem Davis, 22, and Timothy Smith, 22—has appeared on the syndicated daytime talk show The Real, the Tom Joyner Show, and have auditioned for America’s Got Talent. In 2014, they’re slated to appear in several Mardi Gras parades and are even looking for some new talent in the form of men who aren’t afraid to show their moves, no matter who’s watching. ‘I was trying to (have) tunnel vision,’ Kareem Davis said of Saturday’s appearance. ‘It takes a lot to do what we do.’","The Mobile, Alabama-based Prancing Elites had visitors to the Semmes Christmas parade dropping their jaws on Saturday .

"There were 11,419 gun deaths in the U.S. in 2013, according to statistics compiled by live data firm Periscopic. And yet man are still finding new ways in which to kill each other more effectively with firearms. A new bullet has been developed that make it almost impossible to miss a target - not to mention even deadlier. Developed by Advanced Ballistics Concepts, the projectile expands into four connected parts as soon as it is fired, according to Gizmodo. Scroll down for demonstration video . Dodge this: A new bullet has been developed by Advanced Ballistics Concepts to expand into four connected parts as soon as it is fired . Once leaving the tip of a gun, the round becomes a multi-pellet shot. Three fragments separate from the original bullet to form a predetermined diameter, while still being connected to the source. Called the Mi-Bullet, when fired from a handgun the diameter is 14 inches. When coming from a shotgun the diameter is 24 inches. ABC officials say they designed the bullet to improve first and second shot accuracy for shooters in 'high pressure situations'. Stage one: The Mi-Bullet leaves the chamber and already the round starts to slightly separate . As seen in this animation, after just 0.0012 seconds of being shot the Mi-Bullet is expanding into place . The three fragments that separate from the original source are still connected, making the bullet different from shotgun shrapnel . Finally, by just 0.008 second, the Mi-Bullet claims it can expand to its full diameter, which is different between handguns and shotguns, ranging from 14 to 24 inches . The Mi-Bullet supposedly maintains its accuracy by utilizing an accelerated radial spread aided by the rifled barrel, officials say. The larger diameter makes it harder to miss, the company said. ABC designed three levels of the Mi-Bullet to include non-lethal (Mi-Stinger), semi-lethal (Mi-Stunner) and the fully lethal (Mi-Stopper). The Mi-Bullet is designed for most popular handgun and shotgun cartridges. It will be on display next week the 2014 SHOT Show in Las Vegas.

"Muhammed has become the most popular name for baby boys in London for the first time. Combined spellings of the Islamic prophet’s name have made it the most popular name for newborn boys in England for three years in a row. They rank higher than other favourites such as Harry and Jack in the top 100 names for boys from the Office for National Statistics. Now, however, the single variant Muhammad has topped the list in the capital with 768 registered births last year, ahead of Daniel on 666. When combined with Mohammed, the name was more than double any other with 1479 boys given the name. Across England, a total of 7,032 babies were given the name using the spellings of Muhammad (18th), Mohammed (25th) and Mohammad (58th) – topping the 6,893 that were called Harry. On the top 100 names for boys and girls, there has been a surge in names probably more often seen in an Edwardian novel. While Harry and Amelia were the most popular baby names in 2012 for the second year running, names such as Hugo, Sonny and Seth for boys, and Ivy, Darcey, Tilly and Violet for girls are storming up the list. Meanwhile several modern names which had gained popularity in recent years – including Ashton and Reece for boys and Nicole and Kayla for girls – have dropped out of the top 100 altogether. Lisa Penney, of the parenting club Bounty.com, believes that while celebrity-styled or unusual names may be fun, parents know their children will ‘probably have an easier ride in the playground if they choose a more traditional name’. Putting names to famous faces: Prince Harry (right) may have little to do with the steady popularity of his name but Darcey Bussell's (right) role on Strictly Come Dancing is said to have inspired a new generation of Darceys . She said: ‘We are now seeing a growing trend for “old man” and “old lady” names. ‘Just a few years ago Ava and Isla were relatively unheard of as a baby girl’s name, yet now they are in the top 20.’ Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘Many mums are looking back into their family tree and selecting great-grandparents’ names, while others are seeking names which would have seemed stuffy a decade ago but fit with the current retro vibe across the UK.’ It has been suggested that television shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, which counts former ballerina Darcey Bussell as one of its judges, could be responsible for boosting the popularity of the name Darcey. Since 1999 the number of babies called Mohammed, however spelled, has increased by more than half.","Combined spellings of the Islamic prophet's name make it most popular for a third year .

"It regularly lures the biggest names in showbiz to pack their designer bags and take up residency for a good number of years. So it's no wonder that Las Vegas is now home to some of America’s most fine dining restaurants, luxury hotels and entertainment shows that have kept divas like Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Elton John occupied when they're not on stage. Britney, 32, currently the most well-known diva to be digging the desert – recently extended her residency for a further two years until 2016, performing her show Piece Of Me at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood, and is clearly loving life on the strip. Scroll down for video... Born To Make You Happy! Britney Spears is currently the biggest showbiz star in Las Vegas, performing her hit show Piece Of Me at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood - which has now been extended to 2016 . One of Britney’s favourite places to eat – as well as the likes of Posh and Becks and One Direction – is Gordon Ramsay’s Steak restaurant at Paris Las Vegas, just a dice roll from Planet Hollywood, where Britney is currently residing. Gordon's gaff has a superb atmosphere and a mouth-watering menu - including his pièce de résistance, the beef wellington - which is said to have been a favourite for both Britney and the One Direction boys (but perhaps not Posh). Meanwhile, staying at the Planet Hollywood hotel not only has the benefit of Britney on your doorstep, but also Gordon's other restaurant BurGR (breaking the mold of the traditional burger restaurant) and an atmosphere that immediately makes you feel famous. Where the stars stay: Britney is currently performing at Planet Hollywood, one of the most luxurious hotels situated on the Strip . Even the standard rooms are 450 square ft, feature a king or queen bed and a 27"" flat screen - while the 'PHabulous suites' go that bit extra with six plasma television screens, as well as stripper poles in the shower. If you need a quick image makeover (as most celebrities do) or wardrobe change before going out, there's an on-site shopping mall - Miracle Mile Shops - with everything from designer to Urban Outfitters, Gap and H&M. Seeing Britney's show is one of the safest bets you’ll make in Vegas for great entertainment. Tucking in! As well as Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, Britney recently treated her Vegas dancers to a slap-up meal at the Italian restaurant Buca di Beppo on the Strip . Strip search: Planet Hollywood is certainly a go-to destination for many famous faces who vacation in Vegas . Getting a piece of the action: Gordon celebrated the first year anniversary of his BurGR restaurant in Planet Hollywood last year . What the show lacks in live singing, it makes up for in a huge stage production, all of her classic pop hits, and lively interaction with the audience (including dragging one lucky fan up on stage with her every night). The other most notable hotels that are never short of famous faces include the Aria Resort & Casino, The MGM Grand, and The Cosmopolitan. When it comes to unwinding from all the entertainment (and getting over the hangovers) the Palms spa is the chosen destination for celebrities to relax. Former Vegas diva Celine Dion (who decided to postpone all of her shows at Caesars in July to focus her energy towards husband Rene Angelil) is said to have frequented the spa, as well as Hollywood superstar Demi Moore. Diva behaviour: Celine Dion (who decided to postpone all of her shows at Caesars in July to care for her husband) is said to be a fan of the Palms spa in Vegas . It also caters for men, too, with Ben Affleck and Ryan Seacrest also enjoying treatments at the facility, including the Gentleman's Facial. Another celebrity hot spot for dining is STK (at The Cosmopolitan), where the signature steaks have kept the A-list satisfied, as well as the incredible cocktails and high-energy vibe. Most recently Hollywood actor Adam Sandler and his family paid a visit to the restaurant, and also rapper Nas and Orange Is The New Black star Taryn Manning. A-list shopping destination: The Louis Vuitton store is seen here on the strip, just in front of the Aria hotel . Hustle and bustle: The Cosmopolitan (right) is favored by many celebrities passing through Las Vegas including Adam Sandler and Hayden Panettiere . Feeling like a million dollars: The Sterling Brunch at Ballys is known for its bottomless supply of Perrier-Jouët Champagne and unlimited servings of American Sturgeon Caviar . If you're in need of a healthier option after too much indulgence, one of the trendiest new restaurants on the strip is Yusho at Monte Carlo (where the excellent Blue Man Group is currently in residency). Another must-eat is CRUSH at the MGM Grand, which is like stepping into a West Hollywood hotspot for the rich and famous. The cosmopolitan-style plate menu and atmosphere immediately transports you away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, with its barrel-vault ceilings and private dining rooms. Diamond life: Supermodel Nina Agdal seen checking out the Forevermark Diamond Suite at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas in February last year . Celebrity style: Many famous faces choose to stay in The Cosmopolitan in Vegas for their gorgeous boutique-style rooms . Starry night: Hayden Panettiere is just one of the celebs that have partied at The Cosmopolitan (seen here at the Billboard Awards party at Marquee Nightclub last year) If you're looking for one last hurrah before you leave, Bally's Sterling Brunch is certainly a way to go out in style. Having been around for more than 30 years, the renowned Sterling Brunch has attracted just about every celebrity visitor, and was once favored by Frank Sinatra. Thanks the bottomless Perrier-Jouët Champagne and unlimited supply American Sturgeon Caviar it is impossible not to feel like a million dollars (even if the trip has left you cleaned out). But spending your time like a celebrity in Sin City doesn't have to cost you a fortune either, so long as you pace yourself throughout your stay and don't spend too much time gambling. If you are travelling from Los Angeles (as many stars do) or somewhere nearby, a fun an affordable way to get there is travelling on Lux Bus America which has taken the likes of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills to the party destination.

"What happened to my lie-in? The stark reality of returning to work makes tomorrow the most depressing day of the year . You've finished all the mince pies, the weather is terrible, Christmas ended up being horribly expensive and most of us are back to the daily grind. So it wouldn’t come as a surprise if you had started to feel down in the dumps. But don’t worry, you aren’t alone, because today is Blue Monday – supposedly the most miserable day of the year. Blue Monday was originally identified in 2005 by academic Cliff Arnall, who thought it fell on the last full week of January. He calculated the date using a variety of factors including weather conditions, debt levels, failed New Year’s resolutions and the number of days that had elapsed since the end of the Christmas holidays. But over the past three years, researchers analysed more than 2million tweets posted by Britons in January looking for negative language and phrases indicating a drop in mood. They found that today, there will be nearly five times the average number of tweets relating to guilt, as people abandon their promises to pursue a healthier lifestyle. The analysis, by drinks company Upbeat, also found complaints about the weather will be six times higher than usual – and men will feel more miserable than women. Today has also been dubbed Divorce Monday by legal experts. It is the most popular day of the year for starting divorce proceedings. And January is the busiest divorce month, with twice as many divorces being filed as the second most popular month September. According to Divorce Depot.co.uk – an online divorce specialist – 1.8million couples will have rowed over the festive break. They asked 1,000 people to name the factors that caused marital strain over Christmas – with financial pressure, excess alcohol, disagreements with the in-laws and rows over chores coming out on top of the list. According to Divorce Depot.co.uk - an online divorce specialist - 1.8million couples will have rowed over the festive break . Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of Relate, explained that January is one of the busiest times of the year for their relationship counsellors. She said: ‘New Year is a time many of us assess how life is going and this can make people think about how relationships are faring.’ The Institute of Leadership and Management also found that most workers were dissatisfied with their current job – with one in five planning to change their role this year and almost 80 per cent wanting to move firms. In keeping with the mood of misery, a poll by Evian discovered that over a third of commuters described their journey as ‘boring’ and nearly a fifth said going back to work had felt ‘just like Groundhog Day’. Researchers said the happiest days of the year are Christmas Eve and Day, followed by New Year’s Day, Valentine’s Day and the ‘first sunny weekend of the year’. December 24 and 25 - Christmas - 100 . January 1 - New Years Day - 91 . February 14 - Valentine's Day - 81 (mentions of love up by 187 per cent) April 20 - First sunny weekend of the year - 72 (mentions of sun up by 12 per cent and BBQ food and drink by 13 per cent) July 7 - Andy Murray Wins Wimbledon Tennis- 72 (mentions of Murray and tennis up by 141 per cent and 52 per cent respectively)","Web analysis shows tomorrow is glummest day as millions return to work .
