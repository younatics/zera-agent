However, no family members had been informed and no one picked the woman up. For the next three days, family and local authorities frantically serached for Reyna to no avail. Then on Tuesday, Zuniga finally got the call that her mother had been found. 'They found her on the fourth floor of stairwell. I said, ""You mean she's been there almost two or three days?""' Zuniga told KHOU. When she and other family showed up at the hospital they found Reyna wallowing in her own waste, with signs of deterioration from missing insulin shots. 'She was all dirty. She was like passing out,' Zuniga said. 'How can they treat somebody like that?' Reyna is now in a different room at the hospital, but is still confused and emotional about her three days missing.

I tried texting her. I’ve tried calling her. I’ve left her some messages on Facebook and haven’t heard anything back from her.' During the interview, the reporter noted that Waide looked on edge, and he said the investigation was putting him outside his comfort zone. 'It’s definitely intimidating because I’m more of a person to listen and not speak. So with everyone trying to get in touch with me and asking me what happened, it’s been a shock to my system,' Waide said.

"By . Ashley Collman . The newly-crowned Miss USA is facing claims she cheated her way to the top by faking a residency in Nevada, just to get ahead of the competition in her native state of California. Former Disneyland princess Nia Sanchez, 24, won the competition on Sunday but sources say she doesn't even live in Nevada, the state she represented in the pagaent. Sanchez isn't even a week into her reign and she's already juggling issues. In addition to the residency claims, Sanchez is still receiving flack for saying in the competition that women should learn self-defense in response to the rise of sexual assault on university campuses. Cheater? Newly-crowned Miss USA Nia Sanchez answered questions about her Nevada residency in an interview with Fox News . But the most serious claims surround her short-history in Nevada, where she was crowned the state's champion in January. 'She never actually moved to Nevada, but continued to work at Disney and live in California, setting up some minimum paper trail to appear like she was in Nevada and allow her to compete,' a 'well-placed' source told Fox News. 'Shanna Moakler is the Nevada director, and she personally coached Nia on what she needed to do to qualify in Nevada and skirt around the need to be actually from there.' Moakler won the Miss USA competition in 1995 and went on to become the director of the Nevada pagent in 2011. However, Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claim she received special treatment. She says she competed in the pagent by the books, living in Nevada for more than 18 months before signing up which is longer than the required six-month residency rule. '[Las Vegas] is my home,' Sanchez said. 'I have a house there with a friend.' California girl: Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez won the competition last Sunday night, but sources say she lives in Los Angeles . Not true: Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claims and that she has been living in Las Vegas, working as a model, for the past 18 months which is more than the six-month residency rule . Small pond: Sources say many Californian girls set up residency in Nevada because there's fewer women to compete against in the neighboring state . Nervous embrace: Miss North Dakota USA Audra Mari, left, and Miss Nevada USA Nia Sanchez await the final decision . 'I actually had an agent that was working with me in Nevada a lot so I figured why not work in that state, and then I looked into the pageant program because I had done pageants before,' she explained. 'So I figured why not look into the one in Nevada? I really liked the way that it was run, the director that ran it, it seemed like a really healthy, well-run state program. So I decided to go there since I was living there anyway.' According to her Miss USA application, Sanchez currently works for AC Model Agency which has branches in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles but her profile with the company lists her as living in California. She defenends the profile, saying that's where all the lucrative modeling jobs are at but that most of her work is done in Las Vegas. Before that, she worked at Disneyland as a princess and competed in the Miss California competition in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Another source said California pagaent queens often cross the state line to compete in Nevada becamase 'it was easier there'. Strutting her stuff: Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez takes the runway during the evening gown portion of the pageant . Here I am! Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez takes the runway during the swimsuit portion . In California, pagaent girls went up against 100-200 other women whereas there were only 33 in the pool for Nevada's competition. Sanchez says it's just not true that the competition is eaiser in Nevada. 'At least this year in Nevada, we had such strong compeititon. All the girls were not only beautiful, they were smart, college-educated well-rounded women…. I think it was a really tough competition.' However there are other pagaent insiders who think it's wrong to move to compete in a different state, even if the girls do it according to competition rules. 'Most women are really proud to represent their home state, and it starts to become unfair to the hometown contestants competing when this happens,' said Angie Meyer, a former PR representative for the Miss California pageant. 'If you can’t win at home, you have no business competing elsewhere.' Sanchez is also receiving criticism for comments she made during the competition in response to a question asking what should be done to combat a rise in sexual assault against women on college campuses. Sanchez drew from her personal experience as a black belt in Taekwondo to answer the question, saying women could learn to protect thmselves. Fighter: Sanchez, seen in her taekwondo uniform, received criticism for saying women should learn to defend themselves against sexual assault . But some found that answer controversial, saying it implies that only women are responsible for preventing sexual violence. Sanchez responded to the backlash in an interview with HuffPo Live, saying she stands by her answer. 'We have 30 seconds to answer a question. I feel like all you can do up on that stage on national television is answer the best you personally know how, so I answered with something that I know. 'I always believe in women empowerment and women's encouragement and for me, in my life, that's self defense,"" she explained. ""Maybe for somebody else it's a Taser or something else, but that's the way I could relate to it personally.'","Sources say Sanchez set up a phoney residency in Nevada where the state competition was smaller .
They say she continued to live and work in California where she competed in 2010, 2011 and 2012 .

"By . Ashley Collman . Offers for a Detroit fixer-upper reached a record of $135,000 before the intense bidding war caused the auction website to crash last week. The palatial brick-colonial at 115 Chicago Street is one of hundreds of homes being auctioned off on the Detroit Land Bank's website, in hopes of bringing life back into the bankrupted city's ghost-town neighborhoods. Interest in the 3,000-square-foot home surpassed the website's capabilities and the 142 frantic bids caused the site to crash at 5:30pm and it wasn't working again until the following morning. Something to fight for: A bidding war over the above Detroit home caused an auction site to crash last week. Bids had reached a record $135,000 by the time the site went down . New life: The 3,000-square-foot brick colonial is one of hundreds of abandoned homes the bankrupt city is trying to auction off in an attempt to bring residents back to their ghost-town neighborhoods . My house: Local DJ Carl Hollier (pictured) claims he won the property fair and square after outmatching fellow bidder 'tjeff' by $7,000 . Dream home: Hollier posted this screen grab on his Facebook, showing the message he received from the site saying he won the property. He says he and his kids fell in love with the house, which is located just across the street from his aunt and uncle . Alexis Wiley, a spokesman for Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, said the crash happened before a winner could be decided, but bidder Carl Hollier says he has proof the house is his. Hollier, a local DJ, told the Detroit Free Press that he fell in love with the home, which is located right across the street from his aunt and uncle. He thought it would be a great place to call home and raise his kids. But on Friday, he had stiff competition from another user online who kept outbidding him by $100. Hollier decided up the ante and put down $7,000, which he hoped would be too rich for his competitor's blood. That's when he received a notification saying he won the property, and immediately he was overjoyed. 'I was so happy and excited,' he said. 'I called my parents and then I got a phone call around 6:35pm from the Land Bank saying there had been a problem.' Despite getting an electronic confirmation of his real estate purchase, the Land Bank said the website crashed before the other user, with the screen named 'tjeff', could submit a bid and he called the city to complain.

"By . Ashley Collman . The two children were injured Saturday when a bounce house became untethered have spoken out about the terrifying experience. Friends AJ Ruder, 11, and 12-year-old Madison Kelsay were playing together in the bouncy castle on Saturday while their siblings competed in a lacrosse tournament at a Littleton, Colorado park. When the bounce castle became detached from its stakes in the ground, the two were taken for a painful ride, 300 feet across the soccer field. Madison fell out of the castle along the way, but Ruder was trapped inside until the house finally came to a rest and says he lost consciousness. Scroll down for video . Not fun: AJ Ruder, 11 (left), and 12-year-old Madison Kelsay (right) were injured Saturday when a bounce-castle slide became untethered and took them for a painful ride across a soccer field in Littleton, Colorado .

Must be stopped: Parents are seen in the video chasing after the castle, trying to bring it to rest . Injured: Both children were treated at the scene and one of the ten-year-olds was taken to urgent care . 'It was like I was picked up into the air and I was just thrown around a lot,' A.J. Ruder told ABC News. 'I couldn't get a grip on anything.' 'By the time I hit the ground, I just pretty much blacked out,' he said . The two children escaped with just minor injuries, and AJ sported a brace on his left foot during the GMA interview. However, when the parents saw their children flung around in the bounce house they feared much worse. Thankfully, Madison and AJ received only minor injuries.

'He was emotionless, expressionless,' AJ's dad Brian Ruder said of when he saw his son laying helpless on the ground. 'His eyes were opened in shock.'

"By . Laura Cox . Amanda Holden says that she has eschewed her Spanx after discovering yoga . It is something many women have probably done – find a style of dress that means you can fit into a size smaller than normal. And Amanda Holden has admitted she is not immune – preferring Victoria Beckham dresses because she can wear an eight, whereas she would normally be a ten. Yesterday, Holden, 43, revealed the brand is among her favourites, because its dresses come up bigger than usual. It means she can have the satisfaction of believing she has fitted into a trimmer size than usual. And coming just weeks after she revealed she had given up wearing Spanx underwear, it would seem Holden has found a canny new way of flattering her shape. Giving an interview, the actress and Britain’s Got Talent judge said: ‘I love the fact that [Victoria Beckham’s] sizes are quite generous. I can happily fit into a Victoria Beckham size eight, when I actually think I’m more a size 10.’ She added: ‘I love Victoria. I’ve met her a few times and she’s funny and sparky and, I think, much misunderstood sometimes. I feel this strange connection to her even though I don’t really know her at all. ‘I’m thrilled that her fashion lines have been so successful because I’m sure there were a lot of people who would have loved to see her fall flat on her face. Her dresses are incredible and the pieces I’ve had, I just know I’m going to wear them forever or keep them for my girls.’ Amanda Holden has two daughters by her present husband record producer Chris Hughes who was also the former drummer for Adam and the Ants . Her girls are Lexi, eight, and two-year-old Hollie, from Holden’s second marriage to record producer and the former drummer for Adam and the Ants Chris Hughes, 60. Her first marriage, to the actor and comedian Les Dennis, 60, ended in divorce, after Holden had an affair with the actor Neil Morrissey, 51. And giving an interview to this week’s Hello! magazine, Holden went on to describe her daughters as ‘girlie girls’, who have inherited their mother’s eye for fashion. Holden said: ‘Hollie literally goes around the house with a crown on. I deliberately bought her a fire engine, a bus, a racing car so as not to stereotype her, but she goes around in a cape and tiara waving a wand. She loves playing with make-up. At the moment she’s into red lipstick – the slutty look.’ She added: ‘Lexi has such a good eye for putting an outfit together. I took her into Zara the other day to choose a new outfit and I looked at what she’d picked out and thought, “Wow, Lexi, you’ve got that spot on”.’ Holden, 43, shows off her black fingernails on Britain's Got Talent . Earlier this year Holden revealed she had given up wearing Spanx – the shaping underwear which is popular for its ability to help flatten the stomach area – because she had found yoga. And she told the magazine: ‘I was very open about my love of Spanx but by not eating cake every day and doing a bit of yoga, I’ve realised I can get away without them. ‘Also, I’m not the most graceful at getting out of cars and there were a few paparazzi shots of me where you could see them. It’s not a great look, is it? No one wants to see my sturdy trunks.’","'I can fit into a Victoria Beckham size 8, when I think I’m a size 10': Holden .

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman . and Will Payne In Waukesha, Wisconsin . The parents of the 12-year-old stabbed 19 times in a violent attack by two of her classmates after a sleepover last weekend, say their little girl is a 'fighter' and recovering in strides every day. The unidentified middle-schooler was lured into the woods on Saturday by 'friends' Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, also 12, who planned to kill her in order to gain access to the world of the mythical 'Slender Man'. However, the girl survived the brutal stabbing and was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The parents of the 12-year-old victim of the 'Slender Man' stabbing said their daughter's condition is slowly improving. The girl is pictured being transported to the hospital after being stabbed 19 times by two classmates last month . On Wednesday, her condition improved from 'critical but stable' to 'fair', a spokesman at Waukesha Memorial Hospital confirmed. -Parents of 12-year-old 'Slender Man' stabbing victim . Her parents updated friends, families and supporters on a fundraising page set up to help cover their medical bills. In the message, they wrote that their daughter has been walking around the hospital with the help of her father and resting by watching TV in a wheelchair. They say they've been 'overwhelmed with the amount of love and support' they've received, but ask everyone to respect their daughter's privacy by not naming her in social media posts or to the press. 'Our little girl is a fighter and is making strides of improvement each and every day. We appreciate your patience, love and support as we too are stunned and saddened by this tragedy,' they wrote. As of Thursday afternoon, the fund had raised more than $14,000 of its $250,000 goal. Geyser and Weier have since been charged as adults on counts of first-degree intentional homicide, and police say they had been plotting the crime for month. Charged as adults: Morgan Geyser (left) and . Anissa Weier (right), both 12,  face 65 years in prison after admitting . to police that they stabbed the classmate in hopes of joining the cult of the 'Slender Man' Both suspects told police they tried . to kill their friend because of their obsession with Slender Man, a . character they discovered on a website called Creepypasta Wiki, which is . devoted to horror stories. Geyser's obsession with the mythical . man was something her parents seemed to be aware of as well, as her . father proudly shared a crayon drawing his daughter drew of Slender Man . while they were out to dinner on night. But . far from being alarmed by the disturbing sketch, Morgan's father Matt . seemed to find it amusing and posted it on his social network account. Beneath the picture he wrote: 'Only Mogo (Morgan) draws Slenderman in crayon on a napkin when we are out to dinner'. The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth . that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009. On the left, a depiction of Slender Man and on the right, a drawing .

Geyser . was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night. But . they changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a . bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew . there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down. When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband. They planned to play . hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of . sight, in the trees. All three girls were students at Horning Middle School. Above, Geyser poses outside the school sign in a picture posted to her father's Instagram account . Geyser (pictured) and Weier were arrested hours after the attack at a furniture store, where police found them in possession of a 5-inch blade . It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed 19 times. Weier said the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood. But the fighter pushed on, and crawled out of the woods to safety where she waved down passing bicyclist Greg Steinberg. On Wednesday, audio of Steinberg's 911 call was released, in which he can be heard comforting the 12-year-old victim while paramedics rushed to the scene. Steinberg told the dispatcher that the girl had been stabbed, but was conscious. 'Yes, she's breathing,' he told the operator. 'She says she can take shallow breaths. She's alert.' Suspects . Geyser and Weier were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack. If convicted as adults, the girls face up to 65 years in prison. Geyser's family members broke into tears several times during her first court appearance on Monday.

"By . Laura Cox . It is supposed to be the programme that showcases the best of British talent. But switch on Britain's Got Talent tonight and you might be puzzled by what you see. For six of the acts through to this year's semi-final are foreign. And following criticism of the lack of home-grown talent, one of the contestants has admitted he understands the outcry. Tonight will see nine semi-finalists – three of them foreign acts – compete in the first of five live semi-finals, ahead of the winner being announced in two weeks' time. Canadian magician Darcy Oake, whose act involves producing two white doves as though from thin air, says he understands viewers' frustration about foreign acts in BGT . Among them is Canadian magician Darcy Oake, whose act involves producing two white doves as though from thin air. All four of the Britain's Got Talent judges – Simon Cowell, 45, Amanda Holden, 43, Alesha Dixon, 35, and David Walliams, 42, – voted him into the semi-final, following an audition that received a standing ovation. But as he prepares to perform live tonight, the 26-year-old said he could accept the point of view that only Britons should be allowed to compete. Oake said: 'I totally understand and get that viewpoint. For me, Britain's got talent is literally the biggest talent show in the world. 'All of these talent show originate in the UK. Britain's Got talent is way bigger than America's Got Talent. Canada's Got Talent is non-existent. 'They tried it for one season and it was a failure. I figured this was the place to do it. I feel like a lot of people don't realise the magnitude of the show.' The magician went on to say he realises there will be people who don't vote for him based on his nationality. And he added: 'There's nothing I can do about that. I came here to hopefully get some exposure, and that's what I aim to do. 'I can't convince anybody otherwise. If people are offended because I'm not British then that's the way it's got to be.' Fiery: Pyroterra, dancers from the Czech Republic, also progressed through to the final stages . As well as . Oake, the foreign acts through to this year's semi-finals include three . dancers from Paris, a variety act from the Czech Republic called . Pyroterra and Kony Puppets, a puppeteer from Poland. Light Balance is a variety act from the Ukraine, while singer Christian Spridon is Romanian. Three . of the six are in tonight's heat. Should any of the foreign acts do . well it would not be the first time competitors from overseas have found . success on the programme. In 2012 German Dennis Egel reached the semi-finals with a routine that involved singing Nessun Dorma in giant gold wings. And . last year a dance duo from Holland won the praise of the judges, . prompting criticism that the programme was lacking in British talent. But in the past show boss Simon Cowell has claimed foreign acts help push the British performers to do better. He said: 'I think it's quite flattering that they fly all that way to enter this show because they see it as the flagship show, but it means our Brits have got to step it up now.' Tonight's semi-final takes place on ITV at 7.30. Nine acts will perform in front of the judges, before the public vote opens at the end of the programme. In the results show which follows, the act with the highest number of votes will automatically win one of 10 places in the final on June 7. The judges will then select which acts go through in second and third place.","Darcy Oake, 26, says he understands viewers' frustration about foreign acts .

"By . Laura Cox . Poking out from beneath a grassy verge, smoke puffing from a chimney… it could be a scene straight out of The Hobbit. But this underground warren with its hand-carved oak furniture exists not in Middle Earth but in the back garden of a three-bedroom family house. It belongs to a pair of lucky children and was built by their play area designer father, Olly Wotherspoon. Dig this: This underground den with hand-carved oak furniture was created by Olly Wotherspoon and his wife Tamsin for their children Sunni, left, and Noah. It was built in the back garden of the family's house in Bolton . Last night Mr Wotherspoon, 32, said it was memories of the farm he grew up on that inspired him to create the den with his wife Tamsin, 35, for their children Noah, six, and Sunni, three. He said: ‘But we live in a normal semi-detached house on a busy road. So we thought let’s just do it and create something cool.’ The den is buried more than four feet into the ground but has 6ft 4in of head room inside. Because of its lack of height above ground, the creation has avoided planning restrictions. It took 14 days – and £4,000 – to build in the family’s back garden in Bolton. Grand entrance: The warren is buried more than four feet into the ground but has 6ft 4in of head room inside . Cosy interior: It features a large sofa bed, a string of fairy lights, bright cushions and a log fire to keep it warm . Hidden: Noah emerges from a  tunnel that weaves through the hill the warren is set in to a second entrance . Inside is furniture sculpted by Mr Wotherspoon’s tree surgeon brother, with a large sofa bed nestled in the corner. The den is lit up with strings of fairy lights. A drainage system protects it from flooding and there is a log fire to keep it warm. An old porthole provides a sky light, as well as an escape hatch for the children. A tunnel weaves through the hill the warren is set in to a second entrance. It will feature in George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces tonight on Channel 4.

Right, Sunni emerges from the secret tunnel . Now it is finished, it is a place the whole family can enjoy. Mr Wotherspoon said: ‘I wanted it for the kids now, but it will also be there when they’re older so they can go and play down there, smoke a cheeky cig with their mates and that sort of thing. ‘And also somewhere my wife and I could go if we wanted to have our friends round and go down there for a glass of wine.’ Family: The Wotherspoons sit atop their creation, which has a drainage system to protect it from flooding .

"By . Laura Cox . Ben Fogle, pictured, 'instinctively' instinctively¿ hit a mugger in the face when he realised he was trying to steal his bag . As a TV presenter of survival programmes he is used to fending for himself in extreme conditions. Ben Fogle found himself having to deploy his skills in the more urban setting of a London street after a man attempted to snatch his bag. Thankfully it was Fogle who was left unharmed but his attacker was visibly injured after the presenter ‘instinctively’ hit him in the face when he realised what was happening. And taking to social networking site Twitter minutes later, Fogle admitted punching the man in the face, telling his followers: ‘Dear Mr Mugger. You picked on the wrong man. Enjoy the black eye. Love Ben.’ The drama unfolded yesterday afternoon (Wed), as Fogle walked along a central London street, not far from where he lives with his wife Marina, and their children Ludo, 4, and Iona, 2. He was on his way to a meeting with his PA near Oxford Street, where pickpockets are known to be rife. No doubt the attacker hoped to catch his victim off guard, and attempted to seize the bag Fogle was carrying in his left hand. But Fogle, who is used to fending for himself, albeit usually in less urban situations, when presenting programmes such as Extreme Lives, reacted ‘instinctively’, according to his spokesperson, and took a swing at the man as soon as he reached for the bag catching him in the face. Last night Fogle’s spokesperson confirmed he had been unharmed during the incident, nor had anything been stolen, and he had not reported it to police. Ben Fogle told his 105,000 followers about his ordeal on Twitter, telling them his mugger had 'picked on the wrong man' Taking the strain: Ben Fogle, pictured on a rowing challenge, is more accustomed to using his survival skills in extreme conditions than on the streets of London . It is not the first time Fogle has narrowly avoided serious injury. Last year he revealed how his drink had been spiked with ‘acid’ during a visit to a pub with some friends. He suffered a ‘full on psychotic episode’ in which he tried to jump out of a window and through a glass table. And he was kept in hospital for three days while tests were carried out. Speaking of the experience, Fogle said: ‘It was like having an out of body experience. They had to lock the doors and restrain me from hurting myself.’ At the time the former Castaway contestant appealed to the person responsible to come forward, having had to postpone a five-week trip to the Middle East with the BBC. Ben Fogle, pictured, said he fought back against the mugger as he 'wasn¿t prepared to let someone try and take my bag' Taking to Twitter later on, he thanked his followers for their concern and said he had only suffered bruised knuckles in the incident . On this occasion, however, he was simply using social media in order to share the experience with his followers. The spokesperson said: ‘I doubt if the attacker will even look at Twitter. Ben just likes to Tweet a lot about what he’s doing and that’s what had just happened.’ Last night Fogle said: ‘I wasn’t prepared to let someone try and take my bag so I fought back. Maybe it was the right thing to do, maybe it wasn’t. But that’s what I did and I think it was perfectly acceptable given the situation.’ He added: ‘There was nothing in the bag anyway, it was actually just my old gym kit.’","Ben Fogle was walking in central London when man tried to grab his bag .

"By . Lucy Crossley . and Laura Cox . New deal: Jeremy Clarkson, pictured on his way to the Monaco Grand Prix, has reportedly been handed a new three year contract with the BBC worth £12million, despite anger at his n-word controversy . Jeremy Clarkson could be in line for a new £12million deal with the BBC despite being accused of a string of racist gaffes, it has emerged. The presenter is said to be in talks over three more years of Top Gear, just weeks after he sparked outrage over his use of the word ‘n*****’ in a TV out-take. In the clip, Clarkson can be seen swinging a finger between two cars while reciting the rhyme: ‘Eeny, meeny, miny, moe’ before mumbling what sounded like ‘catch a n***** by his toe’. Reacting to its publication, Clarkson said he was ‘mortified’ and ‘horrified’ when he realised it ‘did appear that I’d actually used the word I was trying to obscure’. He added: ‘Please be assured I did  everything in my power to not use that word, and I’m sitting here, begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts weren’t quite good enough.’ Clarkson, 54, has since claimed to have been warned that he is ‘drinking in the last chance saloon’ by the BBC. Despite the row, a BBC source yesterday confirmed negotiations were still taking place about his new contract. 'There is no question of Jeremy’s deal not being renewed,' a BBC source told the Sunday People. 'It is being worked on right now. The top executives want him signed up as soon as possible.' It is thought the new deal – reported to be as high as £12million – would include a £3million annual salary from BBC Worldwide, while an additional £1million would come from the licence fee for each of the three years from 2015 to 2018. The nursery rhyme row followed an  incident in March, when Clarkson joked that a bridge with an Asian walking across it had ‘a slope on it’. At the time he was defended by Top Gear producer Andy Wilman, who claimed the presenter was unaware ‘slope’ was an offensive term for Orientals. Twitter users vented their anger, with one accusing the BBC of giving Clarkson special treatment. ‘Jeremy Clarkson at BBC proves it is OK to be racist as long as you make lots of money,’ they wrote. Scroll down for video . Team: Clarkson's co-presenters  James May, 51, (left) and Richard Hammond, 44, (right) are also believed to have been offered new deals . Pippa Smith, of pressure group . Safermedia, said: ‘The BBC should not enter into a further contract with . him unless he can give a cast iron guarantee he will use responsible . language that is acceptable to all audiences.’ Clarkson's co-presenters Richard . Hammond, 44, and James May, 51, who were recently pictured filming with . Clarkson in Barbados, are also believed to have been offered new deals. Earlier . this month it was reported that director of television Danny Cohen had . allegedly wanted to sack Clarkson, but he was saved by BBC Director . General Tony Hall following a lengthy meeting over the scandal. The controversial decision will save the . corporation millions as the hit show is said to earn in excess of . £150million a year in revenue - more than any other BBC show. Top Gear is regularly watched by more . than five million British viewers, with more tuning in on the . broadcaster's iPlayer service. It . is also shown in the Unites States, Latin America and across Europe, . and it has been estimated that the show is watched by 350 million . viewers in 170 countries every week. In 2012, BBC Worldwide paid £8.4 . million for Clarkson’s stake in a joint venture which had owned the . commercial rights to Top Gear. Previously Clarkson received dividends as a co-owner of the company, but he now is understood to receive an annual seven-figure fee from BBC Worldwide, while the corporation owns the rights to the Top Gear brand. Clarkson's current deal is thought to be worth around £1million a year for his work as a presenter. After details of the 'n-word' footage emerged an online petition calling for him to be sacked reached more than 1,000 signatures, and Labour figures including deputy leader Harriet Harman and MP Chris Bryant called for him to go. 'Anybody . who uses the N-word in public or private in whatever context has no . place in the British Broadcasting Corporation,' Ms Harman wrote on Twitter. Claims: News of his new contract comes after Clarkson faced calls for him to be sacked after he allegedly used the n-word during an un-aired Top Gear outtake . Remorse: Clarkson issued an apology in which he 'begged for forgiveness' and said he was 'mortified' at the footage . But Education Secretary Michael Gove urged the BBC not to axe Clarkson because he had been 'clear in his apology'. Clarkson then declared the corporation had forced him to apologise when he did not want to. He . said he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again, . admitting 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - . especially not a presenter renowned for controversy. But the . presenter compared his apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian . civil war because they were both things he had not done. 'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked,' he wrote. Broadcast: The controversy came just weeks after he referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during an episode of Top Gear . 'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head. 'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.' He also wrote: 'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one. 'An . apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's . shirt...But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and . hoping the story would die down as a result?'","Presenter offered a new deal that will keep him on Top Gear until 2018 .

"By . Laura Cox . Cathy hopes to raise funds for her new lingerie company by pawning her collection of designer goods . Most people considering starting a business would begin by asking their bank for a loan. But former model Cathy Brooks is taking a novel approach to raising funds for her new lingerie company, by pawning her collection of designer goods. Not a materialistic person, Miss Brooks, 47, from Lymington, Hampshire, had barely used the Chanel and Hermes handbags she amassed during her days as a model alongside Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss. And for 16 years they had been gathering dust in her father’s attic. But when mother-of-two Miss Brooks decided to launch Perfectpetalunderwear.com, she remembered an ex-boyfriend called James Constantinou, and the pawn broker’s shop he runs in Surrey. And now she is hoping to make around £50,000 by selling her Chanel and Hermes bags, as well as several diamond rings, a bracelet and a necklace. Tonight, the former model will appear on Channel 4 documentary Posh Pawn to find out how much her collection is worth to Mr Constantinou. It is without doubt an unusual approach to raising money. Although perhaps not to Mr Constantinou, who deals with everyone from bankers flogging vintage Champagne, to people like Miss Brooks chasing entrepreneurial dreams. And after coming up with Perfect Petal over a bottle of wine with her sister and friend, Miss Brooks decided to set about pawning the designer items she had thought would never see the light of day again. Miss Brooks said: ‘We’d been toying with the idea for a couple of years. And my sister said “but Cath we’re going to have to go to the bank” and I’m like “banks, God, re-mortgaging houses. No.” I’d seen James on TV shows last year and I thought well let’s give it a go.’ (L to R) Kristin Roberts, Monika Fuksiewicz, Patrick Tipping, James Constantinou, Lawrence Pickett, Joanne Lawler of Prestige Pawnbrokers . Some of the items were gifts from the mother of two’s ex-husband – a violent drug dealer who wooed Miss Brooks while on the run from police. Others she acquired during her modelling days, on the catwalk and fronting campaigns and catalogues for the likes of Selfridges, Bruce Oldfield and Bacardi. And while one, a Hermes handbag she bought herself, was difficult to let go of, most were barely ever used by Miss Brooks. For 16 years Cathy appeared on the catwalk and in campaigns such as the one pictured for Selfridges, rubbing shoulders with the world¿s top models . And she . said: ‘I’ve had the Chanel handbags, the Hermes handbag, some beautiful . jewellery. I’ve still got my Rolex watch, lots of designer clothes – . Bruce Oldfield, Chanel dresses, I love Chanel. ‘But . as beautiful as they were I couldn’t remember ever even using them. Some of them were given to me but I bought one of the bags, a Hermes . one. And they hadn’t been used for 12 years.’ She added: ‘I’m not a very materialistic person. When I was a model I had some really nice clothing and handbags and I did sometimes use them but not a lot. I’m happier in jeans and a t-shirt.’ Miss Brooks’ modelling career began as a 14 year old, when celebrity photographer David Steen asked her to appear in a shoot he was doing with The Jam rocker Paul Weller. And for the next 16 years she appeared on the catwalk and in campaigns, rubbing shoulders with the world’s top models, before being diagnosed Cushing’s Syndrome, a rare but at times debilitating disease. The disease, which can be brought on by stress, saw the naturally slender model balloon from nine stone to 16, develop facial hair and lose most of the hair on her head. She also developed a hunch in her neck, which caused her to shrink two inches, and she became a recluse in her own home after giving up on her career and refusing to be seen by any of her friends. But looking back Miss Brooks is not bitter about her illness, instead believing it has shaped the person she is today. Recalling her days on the catwalk, as she considers returning as a mature model, Miss Brooks said: ‘I’ve had a great life with it. I’ve worked with Naomi [Campbell] and Kate [Moss] and Yasmin Le Bon and they’re very professional. The former model will appear on Channel 4 documentary Posh Pawn as she waits to see how much her collection is worth to Mr Constantinou . ‘They’ll smile, say hello, there’s no them and us, I never felt that at all. At the end of the day I was really proud that I was in their presence. There was this one show we did and I just remember seeing Kate and Naomi backstage hugging each other and thinking ""God, I wish I had a camera"". 'They were in their little world those two and I remember thinking ""wow, they are so big"".’ Miss Brooks will appear in tonight’s episode of Posh Pawn, which airs on Channel 4 at 8pm. The programme will see her offering three handbags – one Hermes and two Chanel – two pairs of diamond earrings, one diamond bracelet and three rings to Mr Constantinou. And it will reveal whether or not she is made a cash offer for the items.","Cathy modeled form the age of 14 for over 16 years .

"By . Emily Crane . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been described as a 'complete fool' by a Chinese tabloid newspaper after she pledged to stand up for Australian values and to 'manage for the worst' when dealing with China. Australia's history of human rights was also targeted with the nation being described as a place once 'roamed by rascals and outlaws' that would soon adjust to the shifting realities of power. 'Australia's history is not short of records of human rights infringement on the aboriginal population,' the Global Times reported in its Chinese and English editions on Monday. Scroll down for video . The Global Times used a Beijing colloquialism to describe Julie Bishop as a 'complete fool' as it responded to comments made by the Foreign Minister in an interview last week . 'The country used to be a place roamed by rascals and outlaws from Europe. Perhaps it has to boast its values to cover up its actual lack of confidence in front of Western countries.' The newspaper's editorial used a Beijing colloquialism to describe the Foreign Minister as a 'complete fool' as it responded to the comments made by Ms Bishop in an interview with Fairfax media last week. The Chinese editorial compared Ms Bishop's comments to that of Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week that he 'admired the skill and the sense of honour' of the Japanese troops who attacked Sydney Harbour during World War II. Hu Xijin is the editor of the Chinese tabloid, the Global Times, which published the editorial taking aim at Ms Bishop on Monday . 'If Abbott's words were meant to flatter his visiting Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, Bishop's provocation appeared to have come out of nowhere,' the editorial read. 'The current Australian government has been widely considered as inexperienced, particularly in dealing with foreign relations. Still, the naivety of its foreign minister still surprised Chinese people. 'China is Australia's biggest trade partner and has not offended Australia in any way. Bishop's verbal provocation made her look more like one of the often pointless 'angry youths' found in the Chinese cyber sphere than a diplomat.' The editorial compared Ms Bishop's comments to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's when he told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week that he 'admired the skill and the sense of honour' of the Japanese troops who attacked Sydney Harbour during World War II . Australia has relied heavily on the Chinese market in exports  so the Federal Government's stance on China will fluctuate, according to the newspaper. 'Bishop calls for standing up to China, but what resources does she have to do so with? The next day, Australian leaders will smile at China again, just as they do now to Japan,' it read. 'For many Chinese people, Australia is a good place for business, travel and higher education. That's about it. There is no point in China being overly upset by Bishop's words.'","A Chinese tabloid used a Beijing colloquialism to call Julie Bishop a fool .

And, with a wedding to pay for, the estimated $10,000- $20,000 prize money will be a welcome addition for Chestnut, who is the leading competitive food eater in the world. Chestnut managed to win the contest but failed to beat his own world record, which was 69 hotdogs in 10 minutes.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A California pastor accused of causing the death of a 55-year-old man last year has had a murder charge against him dropped. Rob Lynn Cox was charged with murder several months after an altercation with Link Ellingson in the parking lot of a Las Vegas bar in June last year. At one point, Ellingson fell backwards and hit his head on the ground, causing brain injuries that left him hospitalized for six months before he died from a hemorrhage. Accused: Pastor Robert Cox, pictured with his wife Julie, had murder charges against him dropped in court on Wednesday . Victim: Link Ellingson hit his head on the ground during an altercation last June. The 55-year-old died after spending six months in hospital . Cox was arrested in the California church he works at with his father-in-law after a coroner ruled that Ellingson's death had been a homicide. The charge was dropped by a judge yesterday after prosecutors announced that they planned to bring the case before a grand jury. The judge also ordered that the $100,000 bail for the pastor be returned. 'We’re simply not proceeding with the criminal complaint,' prosecutor Robert Daskas told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The grand jury, whose proceedings are . carried out in private, will have to determine whether Cox should be . indicted in the death. Family and friends had gathered outside the court yesterday to show support for Cox, who could be disqualified from adopting children with his wife, Julie, because of the legal case. Hearing: Cox, pictured in a beige jacket and white shirt in court Wednesday, had his bail money returned . Relief: Cox, right, hugs one of his supporters outside the court on Wednesday after the judge dropped charges . At the time of the altercation, Cox had been visiting Las Vegas with some church interns for missionary work. They had stopped at the Four Kegs pub for dinner, before continuing their journey to Texas. According to witness Kelli Lane, Ellingson approached Cox and the interns and said: 'Hey girlfriend, you want to f*** with me?' She said: 'Rob was immediately like, ""Oh my gosh, no,"" backed up, ""I . have kids here"".' Another witness, who was part of the church group, claimed that as Ellingson approached Cox grabbed him around the waist and they both fell to the ground. Ellingson's widow, Marie, has refuted claims that her husband of 29 years would have acted in the way witnesses described. Some of the things he was accused of saying 'are not even in his vocabulary,' she told Associated Press. 'Unfortunately, [the case has] been making me very sad. I'm a Christian myself. It's discouraging to see a Christian church and to see these . horrible things [they're saying,' she said. Mrs Ellingson kept a six-month vigil at her husband's bedside after the incident, and said she had to endure seeing her once-gregarious husband overcome brain surgery, and suffer strokes and coma before he finally died just before Christmas. Upsetting: Ellingson's widow, Marie, says she has been hurt by the accusations made against her husband . Fight: Cox and Ellingson were involved in a confrontation at the Four Kegs, above, in Las Vegas in June last year . For a short time it appeared that Ellingson was recovering. Facebook posts to update friends and family of his condition, shared excitement when he managed to sit up or start speaking again. Mrs Ellingson said members of her church group, Canyon Ridge Christian Church, had been helping her through her grief. 'I . just really wish that the truth comes out, and that things are taken . care of fairly and that Link is looked at in a good light. God is a judge, not me.' For Cox, who claimed he was acting in self-defense and had immediately reported the incident to the police, he must now wait for the grand jury's decision.","Rob Cox had $100,000 bail returned by the courts after judge dropped case .

Dr Yogesan Kanagasingam from the CSIRO's e-Health Research Centre said if the trial's final results were positive, he hoped a cure for Alzheimer's could be found . At the moment, it's only possible to detect the disease when the patient already has significant brain damage. 'You can do brain imaging, but that is at the later stages and it's already too late,' Dr Kanagasingam told the ABC. 'It is the first trial in the world to prove that this kind of thing could be used for identifying the Alzheimer's disease early.' The final results are expected to be released in October, with just 40 of the 200 results already analysed. Before undergoing an eye scan, patients in the trial ate curcumin, which is found in the spice turmeric. The ingredient makes beta-amyloids stand out in an eye scan, which is the primary material found in characteristics of Alzheimer's.

"By . Laura Cox . Having lost both her parents to Alzheimer’s disease, Fiona Phillips has witnessed the agonising frustration they endured of being unable to communicate their simplest wishes. It is a fate she knows there is a risk she could also suffer if the illness takes hold and the television presenter has revealed that she has now decided to write a letter to her husband and sons, telling them exactly how she wants to be cared for should she be unable to verbalise it. Yesterday, Miss Phillips, 53, spoke for the first time about the preparations she is already putting in place should she also develop Alzheimer’s disease. Homebase unveils their 'Time to Reflect' garden with Sir Michael Parkinson, centre, Alzheimer's Society ambassador Fiona Phillips, left, and Arlene Phillips, right . It has meant deciding which care home she would like to be looked after in, despite being currently in good health. Miss Phillips, who is married to journalist Martin Frizell and has two sons Nathaniel, 15, and Mackenzie, 12 made her comments as she opened an Alzheimer’s Society garden at the Chelsea Flower Show yesterday. Miss Phillips said: ‘Of course, [I think about it], of course, my husband says “but you’ve always been scatty, you’ve always lost things, you’ve always forgotten things”. ‘But now I just think “oh God, maybe that means it’s going to become an illness”. I hope not. I just keep meaning to write a letter to my husband and boys, being in a family of boys, and I only had brothers, I just fear for where are they gonna dump me? Fiona Phillips, pictured, lost both of her parents to Alzheimer's disease . ‘So I keep meaning to write this letter to them saying “please, put me here, don’t put me there, and here’s the money for it”.’ To some it may seem like a rather drastic measure for Miss Phillips to be taking this early in her life, however both her mother, Amy, and father, Phil, were young when they developed the disease. Her father was 76 when he died in 2012 and her mother was 74 when she passed away in 2006. Common signs of Alzheimer’s, which affects one in three people in the UK, include forgetfulness - something Miss Phillips said she has always had - and confusion about time or place. And the presenter, who is best known for her GMTV days and now regularly appears on BBC consumer programme Watchdog, sadly recalled the experience of her father when he spent the night in a police cell because he couldn’t remember his address. Miss Phillips said: ‘We didn’t even know he had dementia and apparently he was driving erratically. So the police stopped him, breathalysed him, and he hadn’t been drinking. But they took him anyway and locked him up for the night. I think it’s because he couldn’t tell them where he lived or anything.’ It wasn’t until days later when he began ‘babbling about the police’ that Miss Phillips and her brothers were able to get to the bottom of what had happened. Even then it proved difficult, with confidentiality rules getting in the way. But perhaps the hardest thing for families of dementia sufferers is watching as their frustrations at being unable to remember things can lead to anger and sometimes aggression. And Miss Phillips said it makes her upset to hear of vulnerable people being ‘hand cuffed and slung in a cell’ because police officers don’t know how to deal with them. She said: ‘I’ve had letters from people saying their loved one has misbehaved in a home, the home has called the doctor, the doctor’s said call the police and the police come. It’s sad.’ Miss Phillips was joined in opening the garden, which marks a partnership between the Alzheimer’s Society and homes and gardens retailer Homebase, by Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, whose mother Frieda developed Alzheimer’s in the years before her death aged 97. Michael Parkinson's mother Frieda developed Alzheimer¿s in the years before her death aged 97 . Devastatingly, Frieda suffered such memory loss that she no longer recognised the veteran broadcaster as her son. Appearing at the flower show with his wife, Mary, with whom he has three children, Sir Michael said: ‘[My mother] didn’t believe I was her son, she thought I was her brother, Tom. She also brought my father back from the dead after several years. And she had a girl who came to visit her who she could see and talk to her but I couldn’t. In the end, the trouble with Alzheimer’s is you lose the parent before they die. That’s the problem. You have to live with, not a corpse, but a stranger.’ The Homebase Garden - ‘Time to Reflect’ in association with Alzheimer’s Society was created by award-winning garden designer Adam Frost and a team of young gardeners. It will remain at the Royal Horticultural Society’s Chelsea Flower Show until the programme ends on Saturday.","Speaks for first time about her own preparations should she develop the disease .

"By . Laura Cox . 'TV comedy is a disaster': Triple-Bafta winning writer John Lloyd, who's lent his talents to Blackadder, Spitting Image, QI and Not The Nine O'Clock News . The creator of Blackadder has blasted the BBC’s ‘unfunny’ modern comedies, warning that audiences will desert its channels unless it learns to make people laugh. John Lloyd, 62, who is responsible for a string of hits including Spitting Image, QI and Not The Nine O’Clock News, said the corporation has to find new creative talents. He said: ‘What will sink the corporation is nothing to do with “do people trust it, is the licence fee too much?” Nobody gives a two penny worth about the licence fee, not really. ‘But they really care if the comedy isn’t funny. Then they just won’t go there anymore and that is what will sink it. 'Everybody will be jolly sorry when there is no BBC any more. I am going to leave the country.' Mr Lloyd was speaking at the launch of the latest series of the South Bank Show on Thursday. The long-running programme, which is hosted by Melvyn Bragg, moved to Sky Arts two years ago after it was axed by ITV. He will be interviewed in the first episode about his hugely successful career, which has brought him three Baftas for some of the best loved comedies on television. The producer said BBC commissioners were once willing to give talents like his an opportunity to shine, but are now too risk averse to produce great shows. He said: ‘Comedy is a disaster on television, it’s more acute in comedy than in anything else because so few people know how to do it. ‘Any actor will tell you comedy is the most difficult thing to do. It’s not to me, because it’s what I do. ‘I’ve done it for 40 years and I’ve watched people do it. There are hardly any producers in the country who really know how to consistently produce comedy.’ Comedy classic: Blackadder Goes Forth is one of the iconic series to which Mr Lloyd has contributed . Sharp satire: Mr Lloyd also contributed to Spitting Image, which lampooned such politicians as Margaret Thatcher . He added: ‘We used to be brilliant at . [television comedy], the best in the world , same is true of . advertising, we aren’t any more. ‘There . are always great things but we’ve lost that knack. I used to be given . the opportunity. Blackadder was put out on BBC at prime time, even . though it was a mess. ‘Now . it has to be premièred on BBC3, and now it’ll be online which nobody . will ever see and I do think, especially at the BBC, if the BBC is doing . its news properly, its comedy properly, it doesn’t have to worry about . anything else. And that is what will sink the BBC.’ Latest effort: Panel quiz QI, featuring Alan Davies and Stephen Fry, is Mr Lloyd's first new TV series in 14 years . Mr Lloyd said the only ‘genius’ comedy . writing now working in television is producer Jon Ploughman, whose hits . include Absolutely Fabulous, Little Britain and Twenty Twelve. But he said BBC commissioners lack any creativity, meaning his talents are under-appreciated by the Corporation. Triple-Bafta winner John Lloyd is currently presenter of BBC Radio4's comedy panel quiz The Museum of Curiosity. With a broadcast career spanning four decades, he has created and produced some of the BBC and ITV's most-recognisable series, including The News Quiz, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy and Spitting Image. But he earned most plaudits for period sit-com Blackadder, earning gongs from the British Academy for its original series in 1987 and the First World War-based Blackadder Goes Forth in 1989. He also won a Bafta in 1980 for his work on Not The Nine O'Clock News. Since 1987, Mr Lloyd has worked on and off as a director of television adverts. His first new TV series for 14 years, QI began in 2003 and is now on its 11th series. Author or co-author of 20 books, he was  given a CBE in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting. He said: ‘Jon Ploughman should not have to argue or pitch to anybody, people should go to him on their knees saying “What would you like to do next, how soon can we have it, how much money would you like?”. ‘He’s a man with great integrity and honour and talent. But no, he’s treated like any w***** who’s been flown in from Middlesbrough saying I’ve got 3,000 hits on YouTube, I’d like an interview. 'It’s all gone completely bent out of shape.’ Shane Allen, the BBC's Controller of Comedy Commissioning, called Mr Lloyd's criticisms an 'insult'. 'I don't recognise John Lloyd's gloomy summation that all modern comedy is a thorough-going disaster,' he said. 'It's an insult to the talented comedy writers and performers behind many high rating, much loved shows. The BBC is rightfully incredibly proud of its unparalleled comedy heritage, which continues in abundance to this day. 'From recent award-winning hits such as Mrs Brown’s Boys, Miranda and Outnumbered on BBC1 to Rev, The Trip to Italy, W1A, Count Arthur Strong and Inside No 9 on BBC2; Him & Her, Uncle, Bad Education and Cuckoo on BBC3 and The Life of Rock With Brian Pern and Up the Women on BBC Four, these gems are just a snapshot of what BBC comedy offers across its television channels, not to mention all the multi-award-winning radio comedy including Just a Minute, The News Quiz, The Now Show, Baggage and Cabin Pressure to name but a few. 'We’re sorry if Mr Lloyd doesn’t enjoy any of these comedies, but fortunately millions of other BBC viewers and listeners do and we wish him and his team continued success making QI with us.'","John Lloyd says BBC execs now too 'risk averse' to produce great shows .
'There are hardly any producers who can do comedy consistently' he says .

"By . Leesa Smith . and Emily Crane . Controversial football commentator Brian Taylor stood down from commentating Sunday's AFL match on radio after he made homophobic remarks on live television the night before. Taylor told 3AW he would take the day off from the station's football call team program after referring to Geelong footballer Harry Taylor as a 'poofter' on Channel Seven on Saturday night. He apologised during the half-time break of the television coverage but social media blew up calling for the outspoken broadcaster to be sacked. Scroll down for video . The chair lift that prompted commentator Brian Taylor to call Geelong footballer Harry Taylor (centre) a ' big p**fter' This is the second time Brian Taylor has been slammed this year for homophobic remarks - he  also described his 3AW colleague Seb Costello's dress sense as 'gay' earlier in the season . 'I've spoken to (3AW) management and they have chosen to give me a day off to collect my thoughts, so I'll take the opportunity to have a day off,' Taylor said. 'I made a blue, I apologised accordingly at the first opportunity to the Seven viewers where I made the blue.' Taylor said he also apologised to Harry Taylor on Sunday. 3AW are recommending Taylor undergo 'quite severe counselling' but he will be back on radio next week. 'Even though these comments weren't made on 3AW... we do take this extremely seriously,' 3AW general manager Shane Healy said. 'We just want to let our listeners know that we'll be talking to Brian tomorrow and we'll be certainly commending to him some quite serious counselling.' The comment came as footage was shown on Channel 7’s Saturday Night Footy panel show of Harry Taylor being chaired from the field last weekend after his 150th game when the popular Cat player did an unusual wave to the crowd. ‘I don’t know whether you guys down there can hear me or not. I am up here getting ready for the game and I’ve just seen that crap from Harry - he’s a big poofter,’ Taylor said. ‘You can’t be doing the old royal wave, next thing you’ll have your mum and dad out there.’ The former Richmond and Collingwood full-forward is known for being a long-time critic of players celebrating ‘minor’ milestones. 'In the pre-game show I said something that I regret, and I sincerely apologise in regard to Harry Taylor and anyone — and particularly Harry and any of his friends — that were offended by my remark,' he said. 'I apologise for that and I sincerely regret any harm that I have caused. So, sorry for that.' This is the second time this year that Taylor has been slammed for making remarks that could be seen as homophobic. ‘I don’t want to offend his upbringing or his parents ... but he looks gay. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just a look as sophisticated is a look, as daggy is a look. You look gay,’ he said when describing his 3AW colleague Seb Costello’s dress sense. Some of the panellists on the show with Taylor laughed when he made the remarks but the fans are outraged . AFL fans have expressed they have had a gutful of his offensive comments and are calling on Channel 7 to fire the commentator with his remarks being described as disgraceful and shameful on Twitter. ‘Can someone please tell Brian Taylor he is a flog! He is the WORST commentator on tv ever! He needs to find a new job.’ Timothy Sim said . Kyran Wheatley ‏said the comment did not help the reputation of the game. ‘With Brian Taylor calling someone a big poofter on the Channel 7 pre game 'comedy' show, I can't imagine why no players have come out,’ Kyran Wheatley said. While Dann de Wolff M.B.E. ‏ is capitalising on a possible job opportunity. ‘I really feel like Channel 7 are missing out by not having me as a football commentator. I could pretty easily replace Brian Taylor.’","Football commentator Brian Taylor called Geelong AFL player Harry Taylor a 'big p**fter' live on air on Saturday night .

"By . Emily Crane . An Australian disability activist who is confined to a wheelchair says having a disability doesn't make you exceptional. Stella Young, 32, believes those with a disability are often objectified by able-bodied people who share social media images of the disabled doing everyday things as 'inspiration porn' to motivate themselves. The comedian and writer said the lie that living with a disability makes you inspirational is a 'great injustice' and actually makes life harder for disabled people. Scroll down for video . Stella Young, 32, has revealed she believes having a disability doesn't make you exceptional . 'I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspirational. They were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember by own name,' Ms Young said. Her comments were made during a TEDxSydney event at the Sydney Opera House in April. Ms Young said while she wasn't trying to put forward this perspective as the 'right' one, she's had really positive reactions from people since the talk. 'I think it's really helpful to consider a lot of different perspectives, because disability really is a complex set of social circumstances we try to reduce to something simple and palatable,' she told MailOnline. 'Lots of disabled people have said that they've always felt like this and never been able to put their finger on why it makes them feel uncomfortable. Almost as many have disagreed and that's fine! We're a wildly diverse mob.' Ms Young, who was born with a bone condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta, said back in April that inspirational quotes like 'the only disability in life is a bad attitude' are bull s***. 'It's just not true because of the social model of disability. No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp,' she said. Ms Young, who was born with a bone condition known as osteogenesis imperfecta made the comments at a TEDxSydney event at the Sydney Opera House in April . 'People, when they say, ""You're an inspiration,"" they mean it as a compliment. And I know why it happens. It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional. And it honestly doesn't.' Ms Young said this particular view dawned on her when she was training to be a teacher at a Melbourne high school several years ago and a Year 11 boy asked her when she was going to 'do her speech'. 'I said, ""What speech?"" And he said, ""You know, like, your motivational speaking. You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school, they usually say, like, inspirational stuff? It's usually in the big hall"",' she said. Ms Young said inspirational quotes like 'the only disability in life is a bad attitude' are bull s*** . 'That's when it dawned on me... This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration. For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists. We're not real people. We are there to inspire.' Ms Young, who grew up in rural Victoria, recalled this mentality even back when she was a teenager when someone in her neighbourhood wanted to nominate her for a community award. 'My parents said ""that's really nice, but there's kind of one glaring problem with that. She hasn't actually achieved anything"",' she said. She believes those with a disability are often objectified by able-bodied people who share social media images of the disabled doing everyday things as 'inspiration porn' to motivate themselves . 'I went to school, I got good marks, I had a very low-key after school job in my mum's hairdressing salon, and I spent a lot of time watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek. 'But they were right, you know. I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all. I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation.' She said she wanted to live in a world where a girl sitting in her room watching Buffy the Vampire slayer wasn't considered like she was achieving anything just because she was sitting down in a wheelchair.","Stella Young, 32, says the able-bodied use images of disabled people as 'inspiration porn' to motivate themselves .

"By . Emily Crane . Shocking video footage has emerged of shearers violently punching sheep in the face and kicking and throwing the animals as they shear them. Animal rights group the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal (PETA) released the vision overnight, which they claim was taken in shearing sheds across NSW, Victoria and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014. The shearers were captured stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic and also shown throwing the sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has claimed questions 'need to be asked' about how PETA obtained the footage. Scroll down for video . Farmers were captured throwing sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors in shearing sheds across NSW, Victoria and South Australia . They were captured on video violently punching sheep in the face in 19 shearing stations across the country . Mr Joyce told ABC: 'One of the questions I ask is with the up close shot of the man hitting the sheep, which is obviously exceptional and cruel and in many instances would be immediate dismissal, where exactly was the camera? 'Did the person know that they were filmed? Were they actually part of process? There are lots of questions that need to be asked.' Three PETA US investigators went undercover in 19 shearing sheds across the country and claim to have witnessed attacks by 70 workers, which often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths. 'They were given jobs and they worked with nine different shearing companies. Filming happened openly and many shearers were aware they were being filmed,' Claire Fryer, from PETA Australia, told MailOnline. Wool Producers Australia (WPA) president Geoff Fisken said the actions of shearers in the video was 'unacceptable and unsupportable', according to Stock & Land. Mr Fisken added the footage showed isolated incidents by a few shearers. 'We’re sure it doesn’t portray the 99.9 per cent majority of wool shearers and those shearers would be appalled by it as well,' he said. 'Woolgrowers condemn this treatment of animals; we’re not in the business of treating animals like that and nor are shearers. Shearers were captured stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic . The attacks often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths, according to animal rights activists . 'We want that type of behaviour to be removed from shearing sheds in Australia.' The RSPCA said the allegations made public by PETA were serious. 'The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation,' a spokeswoman said. Outcry has also come in the US over the footage which shows the same treatment of animals in American ranches. Despite not having seen the footage, a representative of the main U.S. wool industry trade group, the American Wool Council, told NBC News the behavior described by PETA was 'unacceptable.''We do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally,' Rita Samuelson told the website. 'Rough handling of animals that might result in the injury of a sheep is an unacceptable maneuver during the shearing process or anytime when sheep are handled.' Shocking footage was released in 2011 by Animals Australia showing the sever mistreatment of animals being exported to Indonesia . Following its release live exports were banned for nearly a month by the Australian government . In 2011 animal cruelty in the live export industry was put under the microscope after footage released by Animals Australia showed cattle being inhumanely slaughtered in Australian centres in Indonesia. This prompted a national and international outcry, and live exports to Indonesia were suspended for just under a  month, from June 7 to July 6 2011. Following this, the Australian government were forced to put in place stronger safeguards to ensure the well being of all animals leaving Australia, but animal rights groups argue the situation has not improved. Following the more recent footage released on Thursday, The PETA investigators claim farmers put tight rings on some lambs' scrotums with anaesthetics to castrate them, but when that failed shearers would just cut off their testicles with shears. The animals were also deprived of food and water before being sheared so they were too weak to fight, they claim. Footage shows the shearers violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer. Activists claim no painkillers were administered to the sheep before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing. The shearers were captured violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer . The animals were given no painkillers  before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing . 'Sheep are very gentle animals. Most of the sheep weren’t resisting in any way so it would have been especially frightening for them,' Ms Fryer said. 'I think it’s extremely shocking. Sheep are very gentle animals. They show fear if they’re on their own. 'It’s devastating and no compassionate person could watch that footage and not be horrified.' The footage was released by PETA in a new campaign targeting the Australian wool industry. Mr Fisken said $2.8 million had been spent by WPA in the last year to train shearers to prevent injury or cruelty. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has claimed questions 'need to be asked' about how PETA obtained the footage . 'There will be a fair bit of attention focused on the industry now and we’re disappointed because we’ve come a long way in the last 10 years with animal welfare standards and we’re continuing to put a lot of resources into that area of our business; it’s a high priority,' he said. He added that WPA would never make PETA happy because the activists wanted them to stop farming all together. 'But we have standards and they're the same as they are for how people treat their family pet,' he said. Overnight, the RSPCA received cruelty complaints from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) regarding the alleged ill treatment of sheep during shearing in New South Wales and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014. The allegations relate to workers beating, kicking and stomping on sheep, and stitching wounds without anaesthetic. The vision made publicly available by PETA overnight shows sheep being beaten with shearing hand pieces and thrown down a chute. Sheep that had been injured during shearing are roughly stitched up. RSPCA notes that shearing is stressful for sheep and it should be carried out by trained and competent workers. The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation.","Animal rights group PETA claim the footage was shot at 19 shearing stations across NSW, Victoria and South Australia .

"By . Emily Crane . It took just 20 minutes to turn this street in NSW's Blue Mountains into a graveyard of ash and rubble when an inferno tore through nine months ago. Buena Vista Road in Winmalee, 80km west of Sydney, lost 42 homes when the worst fires in the state's history destroyed everything in its path. But the burnt out blocks that once resembled something 'from a war-torn country' have now been transformed into construction sites as families pick up the pieces and start to rebuild their homes and lives. Scroll down for video . Christie Daschke and her husband Jake are rebuilding their home after they lost everything when fire tore through their Blue Mountains street nine months ago . Blue Mountains Council has received 143 development-related applications for bushfire affected homes since fires swept through Winmalee, Springwood and Yellow Rock on October 17, 2013. The cost of the rebuild is already at roughly $44.26 million after 185 houses were destroyed and a further 132 were damaged. At least 10 houses are now under construction in Buena Vista Road – the street visited by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during the royal tour in April. Alan Seaman built his house when he and his wife Jocelyn moved to Winmalee 42 years ago and now, at 72 years of age, he is building their family home for a second time. Alan Seaman built his house when he and his wife Jocelyn moved to Winmalee 42 years ago and now, at 72 years of age, he is building their family home for a second time . 'We raised our family of three boys here,' Ms Seaman told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were the second house in the street back then and Alan built it virtually himself. So there was no question about it, we were going to rebuild. 'Alan would never let just anyone build our home, so he's doing it again with the help of our son.' Mr Seaman is slowly starting to rebuild and while the couple have tried to remain optimistic, the reality of their loss is still hard to deal with. Buena Vista Road in Winmalee, 80km west of Sydney, lost 42 homes when the fires hit on October 17, 2013 . Many families were left with nothing when the fire tore through and the cost of the rebuild across the Blue Mountains is already at roughly $44.26 million . 'It was a two-storey house but when we came back after the fires it was flat. We're only building a single-storey with four bedrooms this time,' Ms Seaman said. 'I just can't get excited about it, if I can be honest. I can see things being done but I just can't visualise it.' Christie and Jake Daschke were newlyweds when they moved into 71 Buena Vista Road seven years ago - they too lost everything. 'Seeing that image of the house burnt is just always in my mind,' Ms Daschke, 28, said tearfully. Alan and Jocelyn Seaman were the second house to be built on Buena Vista Road 40 years ago but they lost everything when the fires hit . The Seaman's raised their three boys in the two-storey, six bedroom house that once stood at 45 Buena Vista Road . 72-year-old Mr Seaman, a builder by trade, started rebuilding his home one month ago . While the Seaman's have tried to remain optimistic, the reality of their loss is still hard to deal with . 'I thought the house would still be there but burnt. I just stood there and cried. It was really, really horrible. 'I expected to say “There's the kitchen, there's the lounge room” but the windows had actually melted and there was just a metre of brick at the base of the house left. 'Once it was cleared, it was a bit of relief but also sadness that everything we had owned together was gone.' The Daschkes, who are expecting their first baby in December, are now expanding their once small three-bedroom home to accommodate their growing family. Christie Daschke, 28, was a newlywed when she moved into 71 Buena Vista Road with her husband Jake seven years ago . The Daschkes once lived in this small three-bedroom home. They lost everything they owned in the fires except for their dog Mia who Jake managed to rescue at the last minute . This was all that was left of the Daschke's house when they returned the morning after the fires . Ms Daschke said she felt relieved when the remains of their house were eventually cleared away, but sad that everything she and her husband owned together was gone . 'Both of us decided because we'd started there when we got married and everything we had there, we just couldn't leave. It felt like we had to go back,' she said. The rebuild has been expensive for the young couple who only managed to save their dog Mia when the fires hit. 'I had packed a suitcase with some photos and things like that in it after the fire at Yellow Rock (5km away) a few weeks before,' she said. 'But (the suitcase) was still sitting there two weeks later so I packed it all away. 'There was no warning with this fire. It took 20 minutes to wipe out the street.' This aerial shot shows how the fire destroyed six houses in a row on Buena Vista Road. They were among the 185 demolished across the Blue Mountains . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured here with NSW Rural Fire Services Superintendent David Jones, visited the street to see the devastation firsthand during their royal tour of Australia in April . Blue Mountains Council has received 143 development-related applications for bushfire affected homes since fires swept through . Adrian, Jenni, Jorga and Zak Harrison hope to move back into their home at 37 Buena Vista Road by October – exactly a year on from when their house burnt down. 'Initially there was no question about it, we were going to rebuild, we were staying, we weren't going anywhere,' Mr Harrison said. 'But it's been pretty tough these first few months. It was hard watching the builders clear but once it was done there was a sense of relief that we could start again. It was too hard to go back and see the house as it was when it burnt down.' Wayne Parker is only just going ahead with rebuilding his home of 29 years at 49 Buena Vista Road now . Mr Parker was in Sydney when the fire levelled his house and he watched it all unfold on the news . Mr Harrison said while he was happy to rebuild, his wife said proof that they've made the right decision will come when they move back in and see if the nervous tension and fear of it all happening again fades. 'We will have other bushfires in the valley behind us but I don't think we'll have one as bad as what we did that day,' he said. 'This fire was a freak of nature. The devastation was just unbelievable and walking through the street was like walking through some war torn country.' Wayne Parker is only just going ahead with rebuilding his home now. Fran Elston's home was saved in the fires but 10 of the properties around her were demolished. She erected this sign in her front yard almost immediately after the fires . 'I moved in in 1985 so I've lived there a lifetime. It was a tough decision to rebuild. If it hadn't been for the Salvation Army, I wouldn't have been able to afford it,' he said. 'I had nothing left when the fire hits expect for my outdoor garden setting on the back deck. There wasn't even any ash because everything had vaporised – that's how intense the fire was.' Mr Parker was in Sydney when the fire levelled his house and he watched it all unfold on the news. 'I had sort of prepared myself for what had happened. I stopped at the hardware store before I came back to buy rakes, shovels, gloves and things to sift through the rubble,' he said. 'But when I drove in and saw the house, I just put it all back in the car and returned it. There was no point, there was nothing left.'","Buena Vista Road in Winmalee lost 42 homes in the Blue Mountains bushfires on October 17, 2013 .

"By . Sarah Michael . The demand for 'phablets', large half phone and half tablet devices is growing in Australia . Ever since the first brick-sized portable telephone was released in Australia in 1987, mobile phones have been shrinking in size. But new research shows that Australian smartphone users now want their phone screens to be bigger, because they spend more time looking at their phones rather than holding them to their ears. The 'phablet' market – which refers to half-phone half-tablets measuring 5.5 to 6.9 inches - is set to grow as a result. The study by technology research firm Telsyte found that by 2016 roughly 20 per cent of smartphones users will be using phablets, up from the current number of less than 5 per cent. This growth in the phablet market largely hinges Telsyte's prediction that Apple will launch a 5.5 inch iPhone 6 later this year. 'We think that arrival of an Apple phablet could spur the market to grow faster than it otherwise would,' Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi told Daily Mail Australia. 'Apple has a strong following and a strong repeat purchase intention among its users.' Mr Fadaghi said the survey also shows consumers want larger screen than the current iPhone model. Some 40 per cent of respondents with an intent to buy an iPhone 6 said they had a preference for or would only purchase one if it had a larger screen size. The research also found that one in five existing Android users who are not planning to purchase an iPhone would 'change their smartphone purchasing decision' if a larger screen iPhone 6 became available. Mr Fadaghi said people prefer bigger screens because smartphone usage patterns have changed since 2007. A tech research firm predicts Apple will launch a 5.5 inch iPhone 6 this year . 'When the iPhone first came out smartphones were still predominantly used as a phone handset because there were not as many apps and websites,' he said. 'But now we use our smartphones like mini computers, in many aspects of our lives. 'The number of calls people take compared to the number of times people look at website or open up an app or look at a video has gone down as a proportion.' But while phablets have improved usability the bigger size can be a turn off for some consumers. 'The practicality of larger screen devices for things like going for a run or fitting in a tight pair of jeans is going to be an issue,' Mr Fadaghi said. Mr Fadaghi added that phones are still getting lighter, despite growing screen sizes. 'Miniaturisation continues to happen with regard to thinness – the components inside the phone have gotten smaller and devices gotten thinner and lighter,' he said.","'Phablet' usage set to grow from less than 5 per cent to 20 per cent by 2016 .

The government has ordered a national inquiry into claims of horrific abuse in the sheep shearing industry after undercover animal rights investigators filmed shearers punching, kicking and throwing sheep as they shear them. Animal rights group the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal (PETA) released the vision on Thursday, which they claim was taken in shearing sheds across NSW, Victoria and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014. The shearers were captured stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic and also shown throwing the sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors. One shearer was even filmed hitting a sheep in the head with a hammer. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture told MailOnline that they are 'confident that this matter will be investigated appropriately'. Scroll down for video . Farmers were captured throwing sheep around and slamming their heads and bodies against hard wooden floors in shearing sheds across NSW, Victoria and South Australia . They were captured on video violently punching sheep in the face in 19 shearing stations across the country . 'We understand PETA has submitted the footage to the relevant state authorities for investigation, including the RSPCA,' they said. The investigation comes as Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce questioned the ethics of PETA investigators who obtained footage. Mr Joyce told the ABC: 'One of the questions I ask is with the up close shot of the man hitting the sheep, which is obviously exceptional and cruel and in many instances would be immediate dismissal, where exactly was the camera? 'Did the person know that they were filmed? Were they actually part of process? There are lots of questions that need to be asked.' But PETA hit back at Mr Joyce's comments, explaining that some of the shearers committing the abuse knew that they were being filmed. Claire Fryer, from PETA Australia, told MailOnline on Friday: 'Some of the footage was filmed openly and many of the shearers were aware they were being filmed.' Three PETA US investigators went undercover in 19 shearing sheds across the country and claim to have witnessed attacks by 70 workers, which often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths. Shearers were captured stamping on the heads and necks of sheep when the animals appeared to panic . The attacks often left the animals bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths, according to animal rights activists . Ms Fryer said PETA US managed to obtain the footage when investigators got jobs at the shearing sheds through farmers or contractors. 'The investigators got jobs at the sheds but for their safety we are unable to go into what jobs they were,' she said. 'The concern should be that of all the 19 sheds seen by investigators, they all showed examples of cruelty.' Greens NSW senator Lee Rhiannon has also slammed Mr Joyce's comments and called for a police investigation into the footage. 'Mr Joyce as the Agriculture Minister doesn't do justice to the farming communities who share concerns of cruelty to animals,' she told MailOnline. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has claimed questions 'need to be asked' about how PETA obtained the footage . 'He should take a more responsible position and speak up for farming communities about the abuse,' she reasoned. Ms Rhiannon said the RSPCA and the police should look into the cruelty and 'laws should be enacted'. 'These incidents of cruelty clearly need to be investigated,' she said. The Department of Agriculture spokesperson explained: 'We do not condone the mistreatment of animals. The department believes that the wool industry would also not condone the mistreatment of animals. 'The wool industry, through the industry services body, Australian Wool Innovation, invests significant funding to help promote good animal welfare outcomes. This includes good wool handling and shearing practices.' Shocking footage was released in 2011 by Animals Australia showing the sever mistreatment of animals being exported to Indonesia . Following its release live exports were banned for nearly a month by the Australian government . Wool Producers Australia (WPA) president Geoff Fisken said the actions of shearers in the video was 'unacceptable and unsupportable', according to Stock & Land. Mr Fisken added the footage showed isolated incidents by a few shearers. 'We’re sure it doesn’t portray the 99.9 per cent majority of wool shearers and those shearers would be appalled by it as well,' he said. 'Woolgrowers condemn this treatment of animals; we’re not in the business of treating animals like that and nor are shearers. 'We want that type of behaviour to be removed from shearing sheds in Australia.' The RSPCA said the allegations made public by PETA were serious. 'The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation,' a spokeswoman said. Outcry has also come in the US over the footage which shows the same treatment of animals in American ranches. Despite not having seen the footage, a representative of the main U.S. wool industry trade group, the American Wool Council, told NBC News the behavior described by PETA was 'unacceptable.' 'We do not condone or support the actions of anyone that results in the abuse of sheep either intentionally or unintentionally,' Rita Samuelson told the website. 'Rough handling of animals that might result in the injury of a sheep is an unacceptable maneuver during the shearing process or anytime when sheep are handled.' The shearers were captured violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer . The animals were given no painkillers  before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing . In 2011 animal cruelty in the live export industry was put under the microscope after footage released by Animals Australia showed cattle being inhumanely slaughtered in Australian centres in Indonesia. This prompted a national and international outcry, and live exports to Indonesia were suspended for just under a  month, from June 7 to July 6 2011. Following this, the Australian government were forced to put in place stronger safeguards to ensure the well being of all animals leaving Australia, but animal rights groups argue the situation has not improved. Following the more recent footage released on Thursday, The PETA investigators claim farmers put tight rings on some lambs' scrotums with anaesthetics to castrate them, but when that failed shearers would just cut off their testicles with shears. The animals were also deprived of food and water before being sheared so they were too weak to fight, they claim. Footage shows the shearers violently beating sheep and jabbing them in the head with sharp metal clippers and even a hammer. Activists claim no painkillers were administered to the sheep before shearers used needles to sew gaping, bloody wounds caused by the shearing. 'Sheep are very gentle animals. Most of the sheep weren’t resisting in any way so it would have been especially frightening for them,' Ms Fryer said. 'I think it’s extremely shocking. Sheep are very gentle animals. They show fear if they’re on their own. 'It’s devastating and no compassionate person could watch that footage and not be horrified.' The footage was released by PETA in a new campaign targeting the Australian wool industry. Mr Fisken said $2.8 million had been spent by WPA in the last year to train shearers to prevent injury or cruelty. 'There will be a fair bit of attention focused on the industry now and we’re disappointed because we’ve come a long way in the last 10 years with animal welfare standards and we’re continuing to put a lot of resources into that area of our business; it’s a high priority,' he said. He added that WPA would never make PETA happy because the activists wanted them to stop farming all together. 'But we have standards and they're the same as they are for how people treat their family pet,' he said. Overnight, the RSPCA received cruelty complaints from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) regarding the alleged ill treatment of sheep during shearing in New South Wales and South Australia between August 2013 and March 2014. The allegations relate to workers beating, kicking and stomping on sheep, and stitching wounds without anaesthetic. The vision made publicly available by PETA overnight shows sheep being beaten with shearing hand pieces and thrown down a chute. Sheep that had been injured during shearing are roughly stitched up. RSPCA notes that shearing is stressful for sheep and it should be carried out by trained and competent workers. The allegations are serious and will be investigated by RSPCA Inspectors as information comes to hand for potential breaches of the relevant state animal welfare legislation.","Animal rights group PETA claim the footage was shot at 19 shearing stations across NSW, Victoria and South Australia .

"By . Sarah Michael . A man who was trapped on a waterfall ledge for three days was rescued by a friend who he had saved from similar circumstances 15 years ago. Ben Severne, 48, from Hallets Bay on Lake Taupo in New Zealand, went missing while trying to cut a track in the dense Lake Taupo forest on Wednesday morning after he fell down a small waterfall and got stuck on a platform. For three days about 50 searchers including friends and family scoured the area but it was Mr Severne’s friend of 30 years Brett Cooper who discovered him on Saturday and alerted other rescuers. Mr Severne was shocked that his friend had tracked him down because he had helped rescue Mr Cooper in an amazing stroke of luck when he became lost during a hunting trip in 1999. What friends are for: Brett Cooper (right) with Ben Severne (left). This photo was taken after Brett found Ben in the forest in New Zealand on Saturday and alerted other rescuers . ‘I said “I owed you a rescue and I’ve got you”,’ Mr Cooper told MailOnline. ‘He just couldn’t believe that I’d found him.’ Mr Cooper found Mr Severne on Saturday morning after plotting out the route he believed his friend would have taken. He knew he was on the right track when he found a bush shirt. ‘We went through a lot of very thick bush through the stream and then we found a shirt. I was pretty sure it was his shirt because he’s a big guy,’ Mr Cooper told MailOnline. ‘Then we went down the drop off and we went down through quite a few waterfalls, probably five or six waterfalls, then I came around a corner and there he was.’ Huge drop: The 48-year-old fell fell down a small waterfall and got stuck on a platform. He is seen her being airlifted with rescuer Darryl Jones . Savved: For three days about 50 searchers including friends and family scoured the area but it was Mr Severne’s friend of 30 years Brett Cooper who discovered him on Saturday . Mr Cooper said he couldn’t believe his friend was alive. ‘By Saturday I knew the chances of surviving those three nights out there were pretty slim,’ he said. ‘I knew if he’s had a heart attack he would have been very difficult to find.’ Mr Cooper said Mr Severne, who is on heart medication and has diabetes, was in very poor health when he found him. ‘He had dirt around his eyes and he was gripping his chest and he wasn’t well at all,’ he said. ‘I had some food and I put some clothing on him. ‘He was sick at least once while I was there, it must have been just the pressure of the situation.’ Ben Severne, 48, from Hallets Bay on Lake Taupo in New Zealand, went missing while trying to cut a track in the dense Lake Taupo forest . In time: Mr Severne, who is on heart medication and has diabetes, was in very poor health when he was found . Airlifted: Mr Severne was stranded with his dog Whai and was winched out on a stretcher by a helicopter . Mr Severne, who was stranded with his dog Whai, was winched out on a stretcher by a helicopter. He was taken to hospital by ambulance and he was kept overnight but was discharged on Sunday. Senior constable Barry Shepherd said Mr Severne got stuck after falling down a waterfall and didn’t have any food but was able to drink fresh water. He added that the weather conditions were very wet and windy. ‘He was able to walk around on a small area,’ Constable Shepherd told MailOnline. ‘He couldn’t climb back up the waterfall he’d gone down and the waterfall below him was too big.’ Medical help: He was taken to hospital by ambulance and he was kept overnight but was discharged on Sunday . Senior constable Barry Shepherd said Mr Severne got stuck after falling down a waterfall and didn’t have any food but was able to drink fresh water . ‘He was tired, he was cold… [The temperature] didn’t go below zero but it was windy and wet which kind of exacerbated the cold.’ Fifteen years ago Mr Cooper got lost while the pair were on a deer hunting trip near Gisbon. ‘I was having trouble, I quite bushed… And I failed to meet the helicopter pick up which I should have,’ he said. ‘They had to come looking for me and he was telling the helicopter where I might be. ‘I had a fire going. They found me because they saw smoke.’ Mr Cooper beat rescue workers to find Mr Severne .","Ben Severne, 48, went missing while trying to cut a track in the dense Lake Taupo forest, New Zealand on Wednesday morning .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Sarah Michael . and Aap . Peter Zervas, pictured in 2009, had half of his nose bitten off in an attack at his Leichhardt home on Tuesday . A man who allegedly bit off the nose of a former Hells Angel bikie has been charged. A 28-year-old was stopped near his Hurlstone Park home about 4pm on Thursday. He was charged with affray and cause grievous bodily harm to person with intent. The man was refused bail and will appear in Burwood Local Court on Friday. It is alleged he assaulted Peter Zervas outside his Leichhardt unit building, in Sydney's inner west, after he answered an intercom call on Tuesday. Burwood Police took the man to the station after a Leichhardt Local Area Command investigation into the incident. Mr Zervas had half his nose bitten off. The 38-year-old had to pick his nose up off the ground, drive himself to hospital and have it surgically reattached after he was assaulted at his unit. 'When I say ""set upon"", [the offender] grabbed a hold of the victim with his teeth on the victim's nose, bit down hard and bit the nose off,' Leichhardt Inspector Clive Ainley told reporters after Tuesday's attack. Blood splattered on the front steps of the Norton Street unit complex was cleaned off on Wednesday and detectives were at the scene talking to nearby business owners. The attack on Mr Zervas that police have labelled 'bizarre and severe' came days after his brother's alleged killer, Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi, was granted bail. There is no suggestion the two incidents are connected. Before his nose was bitten off in the horrific attack, a friend of the former Hells Angels bikie said Mr Zervas was on the 'straight and narrow'. Scroll down for video . Mr Zervas (pictured, centre, arriving at court in 2010) is the brother of Hells Angels bikie Anthony Zervas who was killed at Sydney Airport in 2009 .

Mr Zervas's brother Anthony Zervas was killed in a brawl between rival bikie gangs at Sydney Airport in 2009. A week after the brawl Peter Zervas was shot more than six times while getting out of his car in front of his Lakemba home in southwest Sydney, but he survived the attack. The man accused of his brother's bashing, Mick Hawi, is due to be released after he was granted conditional bail on Monday. He applied for release under the controversial new bail act last month after his 2009 conviction for the murder of Anthony Zervas was quashed earlier this year. He is awaiting a retrial. On Wednesday, Inspector Ainley told MailOnline it was not known whether the victim knew the attacker, but he said the 38-year-old let the man into his home. 'The victim opened the door and then he was attacked,' he said. Police are looking for CCTV footage to help identify the man who attacked the 38-year-old.

"By . Sarah Michael . A student has written a touching email thanking another teenage boy from a rival school after he fell to the ground during a 'nightmarish' cross country competition and was helped up and supported by the boy until he completed the race. Oliver, 17, from St Joseph's College Gregory Terrace in Brisbane, didn't get a chance to thank the student he knew only as 'Jack' from Ipswich Grammar School in southeast Queensland. But after Jack had sacrificed his place in the race and stayed with him, at times physically supporting him, Oliver was so surprised by Jack's level of sportsmanship that he wrote a long email expressing his thanks to Ipswich Grammar's principal Robert Henderson. Oliver (left) was helped by rival student Jack (right) after he collapsed during a cross country race in Queensland on June 4 . Jack Chivers, from Ipswich Grammar School, sacrificed his place in the race in order to stay with Oliver, from St Joseph's College Gregory Terrace, and help him get across the finish line . 'I am writing to you to express my most humble and sincere gratitude and thanks to one of your year 12 students,' Oliver wrote about his encounter with Jack at the  GPS Cross Country Championships in Queensland on June 4. 'I had what could probably be described as a nightmarish experience when, about 4 kilometres into the 6 kilometre race, I collapsed on the ground, due to a combination of dehydration, exhaustion and heatstroke. Oliver explained that after being given the all clear from a medical team he continued on, 'desperately wanting to finish the race'. 'Very soon, towards the bottom of what we refer to as ""Heartbreak"" Hill, I was joined by a student of your school who was also competing,' Oliver's email continued. 'Realising I was in distress, he began to give me encouragement, support and I believe slowed down considerably to stay with me. 'Before I crossed the line, I fell twice more – each time, he stopped and helped me get back up and continue – at times physically supporting me, holding onto my arm.' Oliver first collapsed about 4 km into the 6 km race, due to a combination of dehydration, exhaustion and heatstroke . 'This came to a head in the last 200 meters, when he displayed an incredible amount of selflessness and remained with me right until the finish line – evidently not concerned with finishing ahead of or faster than me.' Oliver added that he hoped Jack's story was shared and that received the acknowledgement he deserved. 'I can't help but feel that we would be much better off with more young men like him. 'Perhaps in the heat of the moment, he didn't realise the impact he had had on me, but in a time when I was at my most vulnerable, he showed myself and the crowd of onlookers that sometimes, the result isn't important - it's about the respect and brotherhood that comes about from schoolboy sport. 'I continue to be in awe of his actions.' Jack told MailOnline he had read the email and thought it was 'very nice but probably a bit unnecessary' The boy, who has since been identified at 17-year-old Jack Chivers, told MailOnline he had read the email and thought it was 'very nice but probably a bit unnecessary'. 'I don't even understand really. It's very surprising,' he said. Jack said he was a bit confused about the interest in his act of sportsmanship, after it was mentioned at school assemblies, run in the school newsletter and shared online. 'One of my teachers at school said there's quite a lot of competition around the GPS events and it was quite nice to hear that someone had something more sportsmanlike than trying to get ahead,' he said. 'I saw him quite a few times he was almost falling over, we were at the bottom of what a lot of people call Heartbreak Hill and he was not looking good so I just said ""Hi"" and wanted to give him a bit of encouragement. Oliver said he hoped Jack's story was shared and that received the acknowledgement he deserved . 'You think anyone… I hope they would do the same thing in my situation.' Jack said he hadn't spoken to Oliver since the race but he would like to. 'My head teacher told me he was in hospital. I would definitely be asking about that,' he said. 'He had some sort of appendix problem, I don't know if that contributed to his race issue.' Jack's principal Mr Henderson said Jack was a 'ripper young man'. 'He's very quiet and unassuming,' he said. 'He's a very nice young man and he just noticed another young man being quite distressed and was keen to go to his aid.' Dear Mr Henderson and Mr Hardy, . I am writing to you to express my most humble and sincere gratitude and thanks to one of your year 12 students, in the hope that it may be passed on and his actions recognised in light of what happened between him and I at the recent GPS Cross Country Championships on June 4 (last Wednesday as I write). As an open runner in year 12 who has represented Terrace at the championships for the last 5 years, I had what could probably be described as a nightmarish experience when, about 4 kilometres into the 6 kilometre race, I collapsed on the ground, due to a combination of dehydration, exhaustion and heatstroke. I lay there for about 5 minutes (although thankfully there were coaches on hand) until a medical buggy arrived. After being cleared by the medico, and desperately wanting to finish the race, I got up and continued to complete the course. At this point, only 2 runners in the opens race had yet to pass where I had been. Very soon, towards the bottom of what we refer to as 'heartbreak' hill, I was joined by a student of your school who was also competing. Realising I was in distress, he began to give me encouragement, support and I believe slowed down considerably to stay with me. This continued to the top of the hill, and right until the finish. Before I crossed the line, I fell twice more – each time, he stopped and helped me get back up and continue – at times physically supporting me, holding onto my arm. This came to a head in the last 200 meters, when he displayed an incredible amount of selflessness and remained with me right until the finish line – evidently not concerned with finishing ahead of or faster than me. I finished with him, and unfortunately I didn't get the opportunity to express my thanks as he disappeared into the crowd. All I caught at the time was his name – Jack – but I can honestly say that his actions represented the most sportsmanlike and rare example of character I have ever witnessed in a person. Finishing that race was probably one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, but I certainly would have failed without him. After a bit of searching, I found that his name was Jack Chivers, and that GPS had been his first race of the season. The lengths I went to make contact with him were unsuccessful in the days following. I simply want to express what a fine representative of Ipswich Grammar School that Jack was – what was probably my first ever interaction with one of your students is one which I doubt I will forget for a long, long time. I would hope that his story is shared and that he receives the plaudits and acknowledgement he deserves, because I can't help but feel that we would be much better off with more young men like him. Perhaps in the heat of the moment, he didn't realise the impact he had had on me, but in a time when I was at my most vulnerable, he showed myself and the crowd of onlookers that sometimes, the result isn't important - it's about the respect and brotherhood that comes about from schoolboy sport. I continue to be in awe of his actions. I still would love to be able to thank Jack personally, but until I could do that, I simply felt compelled to retell his story to yourselves.

"By . Ruth Styles . She's less than two weeks into her reign but Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she was welcomed by Portuguese First Lady Maria Cavaco Silva in Lisbon today. Fresh from a successful trip to meet the Pope at the Vatican, Letizia was immaculate in a silver-grey sheath dress and tailored jacket, accessorised with a chic snakeskin clutch. Letizia and her husband, the new King Felipe VI of Spain, are on a state visit to Portugal, the first of a series that also includes trips to France and Morocco. Glamorous: Spain's Queen Letizia meets Portuguese First Lady Maria Cavaco Silva in Lisbon . The royal couple travelled to Portugal at the request of President Aníbal Cavaco Silva, who sent an invitation along with a message of congratulation following their coronation on the 19th June. Since then, their duties have included a trip to Rome where they met Pope Francis at the Vatican and a number of engagements in Spain, among them the 150th anniversary celebrations for the Spanish Red Cross in Madrid. There, the new Queen, immaculate as ever, was mobbed by adoring crowds - although even that failed to leave her looking less than lovely. Now considered one of the world's most glamorous monarchs, Letizia is as famous for her dress sense as she is for her charity work. The 41-year-old mother-of-two has carved out a name for herself as a royal style icon and even, on one memorable occasion, managed to outshine the ultra-glamorous Carla Bruni. Elegant: The Spanish queen was on her second overseas visit since being crowned on 19th June . Stylish: Letizia is now considered one of the world's most glamorous monarchs thanks to her killer wardrobe . Her current wardrobe of tailored sheath dresses, sky-scraping court shoes and eye-catching jewels is all a far cry from her early days as a newsreader, when she embraced the bland Armani suit and was rarely seen in public wearing anything else. But since marrying into the Spanish royal family in 2004, her wardrobe has undergone a remarkable transformation. She adores a leg-lengthening nude heel and is almost as addicted to her Magrit suede tan court shoes as the Duchess of Cambridge is to her nude patent L.K Bennett 'Sledge' heels. The Spanish queen also shares another trait with the UK's future queen: a penchant for homegrown labels and the high street. In Letizia's case, that means slim-fitting sheath dresses picked up in Mango, Zara and Uterqüe - many of which she wears time and time again. Royal welcome: Queen Letizia looks on as King Felipe signs the visitors' book at Portugal's Presidential Palace . Warm: The newly crowned Queen of Spain smiles as she chats to President Anibal Cavaco Silva of Portugal . That, however, doesn't mean she won't splash out on a more expensive frock should one catch her eye. Her favourite piece is reportedly a black guipure lace dress by local designer, Felipe Varela, which she wore on her last visit to Portugal in 2012, again for her 40th birthday party and again in March this year. Another favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by Hugo Boss which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer. Off duty, the Princess' style becomes markedly more relaxed, with cropped trousers, billowing shirts and even the odd pair of jeans making up the bulk of her wardrobe. But as her occasional foray back into grey Hugo Boss tailored trousers reveals, some style habits die hard - Queen or not. Looking good: Letizia was the picture of elegance as she and King Felipe met with the Portuguese leader . Busy schedule: Along with their visit to Portugal, the Spanish royals will travel to Morocco and France .","Queen Letizia was glamorous in silver as she arrived in Portugal .

Thorne, 21, joined Derby from West Brom last weekend before sustaining the injury during a pre-season friendly defeat against Zenit St Petersburg on Tuesday. He left Derby's camp in Austria on Wednesday and had surgery on Thursday. Meteoric rise: Thorne was part of the Derby side that lost the play-off final against QPR last season . Bad timing: Thorne completed a permanent move to Derby only days before injuring his knee ligaments . Thorne tweeted: 'Obviously gutted doesn't really cut it, but I know how to handle it. Appreciate all the messages guys'. He added: 'Dont forget what the team achieved last year. Exciting season ahead & I'll join them for the run in. Look forward to seeing the iPro rocking'. Derby manager Steve McClaren told the club's official website: 'At the time it looked to be innocuous as there was no-one near George and we thought he had just jarred his knee. 'Scans have revealed that he has ruptured his cruciate ligament and he will be operated on today (Thursday). 'It is a huge disappointment for George personally and we wish him a speedy recovery. 'We were patient in our quest to sign him this summer, as he was too, and this news demonstrates the pitfalls of football in general. 'Everyone’s thoughts are with George and there is no doubt he will come back from this.' Faith: Derby manager Steve McClaren is confident Thorne will bounce back from this blow .","Derby completed signing of George Thorne from West Brom on July 19 .

"By . Sarah Michael . Police have ruled out the possibility that French model Fabien Ardoin was taking a photo when he fell to his death from a cliff edge in New South Wales on Sunday, as friends have paid tribute to the 'charming' and 'ambitious' 23-year-old. Mr Ardoin plunged 40 metres after it is believed the sandstone cliff he was standing on crumbled at Wedding Cake Rock in the Royal National Park, south of Sydney. Police are still investigating how he fell, and said he was not taking a photo at the time and none of the seven friends that were with him were taking a photo either. Scroll down for video . Fabien Ardoin fell to his death from a cliff edge in New South Wales on Sunday . The 23-year-old Frenchman was described by friends as 'ambitious' and spent his weekends modelling and working as a topless waiter in Sydney . Meanwhile, friends and former workmates have paid tribute to the 'ambitious' French student. His boss at Sydney topless waiter company Butlers in the Buff, Peter Suttle, described Mr Ardoin's death as 'tragic'. 'He was very charming, very intelligent, very switched on,' Mr Suttle, 31, told MailOnline. 'We got great feedback from all the clients he worked for. You know I mean most of the events he attended were hens parties and birthday parties and all the guests had a lot of great things to say about him.' Mr Ardoin also did research at the University of Wollongong, where he was studying engineering, and was trying to find an Australian modelling agent. He was also in talks with a friend's brother about starting work at a Sydney engineering firm. Mr Suttle said Mr Ardoin was well-educated and well-traveled for his age and could speak Mandarin, Spanish, French and English. Mr Ardoin had worked for Butlers in the Buff in Sydney on weekends for the past three months, and had discussed expanding the business to Hong Kong. 'He was very, very fond of Hong Kong,' Mr Suttle said. 'Being an ambitious type he could see it would work very well over there.' The body of a 23-year-old Frenchman was recovered by police at 6.30pm on Sunday at an Australian National Heritage site in Sydney . Photographer Edmund Edwards, who did a photo shoot with Mr Ardoin six weeks ago, said he had put Mr Ardoin in contact with a friend’s brother to help him get a job at an engineering firm in Sydney. 'Fabian wanted to work in Australia. He just wanted to work around the world and get different experiences,' Mr Edwards told MailOnline. Police recovered Mr Ardoin's body after a gruelling search operation at around 6.30pm on Sunday. They were called to the scene around 10.30am. Inspector Barry Bourchier said where Mr Ardoin fell was away from the marked walking track and that his companions were too distressed to provide statements to police. Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate, the NSW Police Corporate Sponsor for the safety and welfare of international students, said the incident was a sad reminder of Australia's dangers. 'It was a tragedy yesterday and what comes with Australia being regarded - and we all know - as one of the most beautiful countries in the world, if we don't respect the beauty, tragedy can happen,' he said. Mr Ardoin had been bushwalking through the National Park with a group of seven friends from Wollongong University, including his girlfriend, when he slipped down an embankment. Gone too soon: Ardoin was an international model, according to his Facebook page, and was enjoying living in Sydney with his girlfriend . Two police rescue officers abseiled down the cliff to retrieve the body on Sunday night . Police have ruled out the possibility that Mr Ardoin was taking a photo when he fell . The man was with a group of seven friends from Wollongong University, including his girlfriend . It was first reported that the man had fell about 10 metres after losing his grip while hanging from a sandstone ledge on Sunday morning. They later confirmed he fell around 40 metres. His friends witnessed him fall north of Little Marley Beach and were assisting police with their inquires. Police found Ardoin's body with the help of State Emergency Services officers and Fire and Rescue crew. Authorities tried to access the body by air but high winds and rough seas impeded recovery efforts. Emergency services were called the scene at about 10.30am . Five SES officers were called to the scene and rigged anchor points into the bedrock. Local controller of the Wollongong unit Steve Cliff said two police rescue officers abseiled down the cliff to retrieve the body on Sunday night. Police said the 'long and difficult' operation concluded at 8.30pm and the body was sent to a morgue for examination. The Royal National Park - also known as the 'Nasho' or just 'the Royal' - was established in 1879, according to the Office of Environment and Heritage. It's the world's second-oldest national park and features heritage attractions, spanning 16,000 hectares. It is an hour's drive from Sydney and Wollongong.","Fabien Ardoin, 23, fell to his death from a cliff edge in NSW on Sunday .

"By . Emily Crane . and Ryan Lipman . A social media filter that can identify risky comments or photos and urge people to reconsider what they post could stop sporting stars from being embroiled in online scandals. The real-time monitoring technology has been developed for sporting clubs in a bid to stop players from posting 'inappropriate stuff' on social media that can often tarnish a sport's brand. Former Cronulla Sharks player Todd Carney was the latest NRL player to be disgraced after he was sacked earlier this month when a photo of him urinating in his mouth was published on social media. Former NRL player Todd Carney is the most recent sportsperson to court controversy on social media after an image of him 'bubbling' was published on Twitter earlier this month . Sydney-based company, Kudos Knowledge, developed the filter to pick up risky information on Facebook and Twitter and has the potential to alert a third party like a sport club administrator. The technology will focus on the 'indiscretion' of sport stars but will also be implemented at high schools to try and stamp out online bullying. It will undergo its first trial at Sydney's Matraville Sports High School next month. Moderating tools can recognise risky posts that contain blacklisted words or phrases or if it is posted at a particular time of day, for example 1am to 5am. The Facebook or Twitter post is then automatically stalled while an alert is sent to the person about its offensive nature and asks them to reconsider posting it. Costly: NRL player Josh Dugan's career was almost prematurely ended when after a long string of trouble, he told a Canberra Raiders fan to kill himself on Instagram last year . The post can then be deleted, modified or the warning can be ignored. 'There's an optimistic hope that it will shift behaviours so players think about what they're posting on social media,' Carlton Taya, the director of Kudos Knowledge, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Hopefully this will be a solution that deals with inappropriate stuff being put out there by sporting players.' The Brisbane Broncos famously dropped contract negotiations with NRL player Josh Dugan last year after he told a Canberra Raiders fan on social media to kill himself. West Tigers captain Robbie Farah was also forced to apologise to former Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2012 after one of his deleted tweets resurfaced, which said Ms Gillard should be given a noose for her 50th birthday. West Tiger player Robbie Farah posted on Twitter in 2012 that then-prime minister Julia Gillard should be given a noose for her 50th birthday . Mr Taya said his company had been in talks with sporting clubs for the past six months about implementing the technology. 'We saw a need for clubs who are concerned about damage to their brand. You think about it, the sporting clubs are very positive about it,' he said. 'There’s no big brother there looking at you, it’s just monitoring and moderating.' Developers are also working on an image function where skin-coloured pixels could flag nudity, or the shapes of weapons could be identified. This could then be used to target Instagram posts and apps like Snapchat. In 2013, George Burgess joined the list of NRL players who have had explicit material of themselves posted on Twitter . The Rabbitohs player had two naked photos posted on social media, but no action was taken against him by his club or the NRL . The technology already has risky key words programmed to help moderate, but sporting clubs or schools would be able to determine exactly what should be filtered. 'Bullying has now become the number one issue in schools. So it’s more about teaching students about what they should or should not be posting,' Mr Taya said. 'If a user is being called a particular name online, that keyword could be loaded into the system and then any post referencing that particular word would be filtered or blocked. 'You can keep loading in more keywords, depending on what the bullies are saying or the victims are experiencing.' The technology, which developers say is teaching a computer to understand the mean behind human actions, took 2.5 years of research and development. Josh Bootsma used social media to inappropriately message a 15-year-old fan and sent explicit Snapchat messages . The list of Australian athletes and sportspeople who have courted controversy on social media is long and diverse. In June AFL player Josh Bootsma sent a string of lurid messages to a young fan just 15 minutes after connecting with her on social media - propositioning her for sex and sending explicit Snapchat messages. As a result, the 21-year-old was later sacked by his club Carlton. English-born South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL player George Burgess was at the centre of a naked selfie scandal, when two photos of him completely naked made it onto Twitter last June, although he escaped unscathed with no action taken against him by his club or the NRL. But not all the sportspeople and athletes that have caused a stir on social media have come from football leagues. Controversial swimmer Nick D'arcy and Kenrick Monk caused an uproar when a photo of the pair holding guns in a U.S. gun store was posted on Facebook and Twitter. 'Foolish': Olympic swimmers Nick D'arcy and Kenrick Monk sparked the ire of Swimming Australia and the public when a photo of them holding guns in a U.S. gun store was posted on Twitter and Facebook . D'Arcy, pictured left, and Monk were in California on a swim camp before the 2012 London Olympics when the photo was taken . The swimmers were on an Olympic team camp in California before the 2012 London Olympics when the photo was taken. Calling the photo 'inappropriate' and 'foolish', Swimming Australia investigated the incident and ordered the photos to be taken down, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. As punishment, both swimmers were sent home from the London Olympics by the Australian Olympic Committee as soon as their swimming events finished and they were also banned from using social media during the games. Swimming's former pinup girl Stephanie Rice also faced intense public backlash after calling the South African rugby team 'f*****s' on Twitter in September 2010. The tweet was made on the back of a rugby union game, which saw the Wallabies beat South Africa's Sprigboks. 'Suck on that f*****s. Probs the best game I've ever seen!! Well done boys,' she posted. Following the controversy around the offensive tweet, Rice held a press conference where she offered a public apology. Crying during the conference, Rice called her comments 'a huge error of language and judgement' but the outcry saw her dumped by sponsor Jaguar. Backlash: Stephanie Rice held a press conference in 2010 after she called the Sprigboks f*****s following a game with the Wallabies . Former Canberra Raiders player Joel Monaghan was left disgraced when a photo of him simulating a sex act with a dog was posted on Twitter. The image was reportedly taken during the Raider's post-season Mad Monday celebrations in 2010. At the time then-NRL chief executive David Gallop said expressed his shock and even the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) commented on the disturbing nature of the image. Following the incident, Monaghan left the club and now plays in Europe.

The New Zealand Warriors' Konrad Hurrell was embroiled in a Snapchat sex video scandal, when a video of the NRL player and a woman later identified as New Zealand soap star Teuila Blakely, appeared on social media. The Warriors and the NRL integrity unit investigated the incident and both Hurrell and Blakey claimed they did not know how the video was uploaded in May this year. Reportedly taken as a private video two months before being leaked, it features Blakely performing a sex act on Hurrell while he drives a car. It was later posted and went viral on Instagram after being shared with a friend, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

"By . Caroline Howe . When alleged drug dealer and jazz saxophonist, Robert Vineberg was arrested in February, 2014, accused of selling 73 bags of heroin – the last deadly hit -- to the Oscar-winning actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman, there was no question who Vineberg’s lawyer was going to call: bail bondsman to the stars Ira Judelson. Vineberg had been sent to Rikers Island prison where he sat for two weeks, sleepless and sick while kicking his heroin habit. Bail was set at $200,000--over $40,000 cash--for the musician who got out of jail when Judelson, known as The Fixer, posted his bond. Vineberg faces three felony charges that could deliver 25 years behind bars as well as deportation back to Canada where he grew up. Before the fall: Revered actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's lifeless body was found in his Manhattan apartment on February 2 with envelopes branded 'Ace of Spades' brand heroin . Out on bail: Thanks to The Fixer Ira Judelson, accused heroin dealer in the Hoffman case Robert Vineberg was released after rotting in jail for two weeks . But for now at least, he’s free. Whether it’s a celebrity, a mobster, an athlete, a drug dealer or the ‘millionaire’ madam Anna Gristina, in New York Judelson’s phone number is the one to have in your black book. He knows how to rattle the cages of judges, lawyers and cops to bail his celebrity and common criminal clients out of big jams and out of jail. With a client list including New York Giants football players Plaxico Burress and Lawrence Taylor, rappers Ol’Dirty Bastard, Ja Rule, Lil’ Wayne and DMX, notorious Manhattan madam Kristin Davis, and former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Judelson is the macher—a schemer with many plans--he writes in his upcoming book, The Fixer, soon to be published by Simon & Schuster. ‘I don’t chase bad guys. They mostly come to me because I lend them money at a rate. It’s not exactly free. I’m like a legal loan shark’, Judelson writes. Was he wearing his Calvins? Judelson was called to bail out Calvin Klein's ex-lover, Nick Gruber, when the former erotic model was busted in April 2012 on a drug charge--hiding cocaine in his underwear . When good guys or bad guys, mob guys or white collar guys are caught doing something illegal, they’re in the system and usually need to put up their house, business or property as a guarantee they won’t skip town on their bail. That has to be done through a licensed bondsman who gets a percentage of the bond. If the client does a runner, the bondsman loses his fee and could be responsible for the full amount of the bail. The fee in New York is a 6-8-10 percent structure; the higher the bail the lower the percentage. ‘It’s like a blood oath, because if you f*** with me, you f*** with my living. You f*** with my family’, the author says. ‘I might be the only person keeping you from getting sucked up in the injustice system. I know who to touch for a favor to make sure your time inside goes easy, which judges might let you slide and which ones have zero tolerance. ‘I have a direct line to white-shoe lawyers who’ll work pro bono… and I know the cops and the DAs who believe in second chances. So yeah…I guess I’m a macher. It’s my job to make things happen. It’s my job to get you out of jail’. Busted: When rapper Ja Rule was arrested with Lil Wayne on gun and drug charges following a concert at the Beacon Theatre in Manhattan, Ja's manager called Jedelson . Judelson, was called to bail out Calvin Klein’s ex-lover, Nick Gruber, when the former erotic model was busted in April 2012 on a drug charge--hiding cocaine in his underwear--and for beating up a pal at his West Village apartment. Judelson posted the $10,000 bond for the porn actor who appeared in a group sex scene in the gay porn film, Next Door Buddies. When Rapper Ja Rule was arrested with Lil Wayne in July 2007 on gun and drug charges following a concert at the Beacon Theatre in upper Manhattan. Ja’s manager called Judelson. Ja put up his house in Jersey which was worth about $2 million, enough to cover his uncle and their limo driver, who were also pinched that night. He also worked Lil Wayne’s bond. No one spent a single night in jail. It was the beginning of a long friendship with Ja who started sending other clients to the bondsman. Fifty Cent, Fabolous, Fat Joe – put him on their speed dial. Biggest bond: 'But you should know. I believe in this man,' Dominique Staruss-Kahn's then wife Anne Sinclair told Judelson as she put up their Washington D.C home and cash as collateral for the massive $6 million bailout . DMX, the second rapper in history to release back-to-back #1 albums in the same year after Tupac Shakur, called Judelson when he was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, criminal impersonation, criminal mischief, driving under the influence and possession of cocaine. He was picked up racing to JFK airport with a red siren on his car – claiming to be a federal agent. Judelson got him out the next day but DMX couldn’t stay out of trouble. He never got the career he deserved, the author writes. The bail he wrote for Dominique Strauss-Khan, (DSK) the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was a game-changer, an ‘eye-popping, jaw-dropping $5 million,’ Judelson writes. ‘No one had ever written a $5 million bail before – not in New York, not in any other state in the country. No one, that is, but yours truly.’ Who ya gonna call: The Fixer is the moniker Ira Judelson uses to describe his unique talents. The bail bondman tells his tale in his upcoming book. It was a wild ride, he says, back in May 2011, when Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of sexual assault and attempted rape of a chambermaid at a midtown New York City hotel. She claimed he’d forced her to have sex with him. The leading candidate for the French presidency at the time, DSK was met by police on the tarmac at JFK and taken off his Paris-bound plane. The bond was $5 million plus $1 million in cash. DSK’s wife at the time, Anne Sinclair, a radio and television reporter, was en route from France with the cash, accompanied by two bodyguards, ex Navy SEALS. She also put up their house in Washington, DC as collateral which satisfied the insurance company – and Judelson wrote the bond for $6 million – against the house and $3 million in cash.","Ira Judelson, who calls himself The Fixer, is a bail bondsman who has written a book about how he got his famous clients an out of jail card .

"By . Ruth Styles . She's the glamorous Monégasque princess turned model and now showjumper but it seems life isn't always so charmed for Charlotte Casiraghi. Competing in the jump-off during the Prize Evian competition at the Paris Eiffel Jumping, the royal, 27, took a tumble, ending the event sprawled on the sand. Despite the painful fall, the fifth-in-line to the throne of Monaco was soon back on her feet and was helped off the Champ de Mars course by officials. Ouch! Charlotte Casiraghi grimaces after taking a tumble from her horse during the Paris Eiffel Jumping . Sore: The Monégasque royal rubs her backside as officials descend to help her off the course . Her horse, a dapple grey gelding named Tintero, was also none the worse for his stumble and was caught by grooms before being led off to the stables. Casiraghi has pursued a professional showjumping career since 2009 but put her career on hold last year ahead of the birth of her baby son Raphaël last December. Like Zara Phillips, the royal was soon back in the saddle and last month proved she was back to winning ways when she triumphed in the Longines Pro-Am Cup in Monte-Carlo. Joined by Gucci team mate, Edwina Tops-Alexander, Casiraghi beamed as she was handed the trophy by her mother, Princess Caroline of Monaco, watched by her brother Andrea and his wife, Tatiana Santo Domingo. Bad day: Casiraghi is helped from the course on Paris' Champs de Mar which sits in front of the Eiffel Tower . It all started so well! Charlotte Casiraghi and Tintero compete in the jump-off at Paris Eiffel Jumping . Sponsorship: Casiraghi and British team mate Edwina Tops-Alexander make up Team Gucci . Looking good: Casiraghi has recently returned to showjumping following the birth of her son Raphael last year . The win came just a week after Casiraghi and her fiancé, Gad Elmaleh, 43, held a lavish christening party for their baby son. At the party, which took place at the royal palace of Monaco, the couple were joined by Princess Caroline and her daughter, Princess Alexandra of Hanover, as well as Charlotte's uncle Prince Albert of Monaco, 56, and his wife Princess Charlene, 36. The royal couple can look forward to the baptism of their own baby later this year, after announcing Charlene's pregnancy last month. Although early reports suggested that the South African former swimmer was expecting twins, the Prince's Palace of Monaco is yet to confirm whether one or two new additions to the Monégasque royal family will arrive in December. Model mother: Casiraghi is the face of Gucci Equestrian and also competes for Team Gucci in showjumping . Parents-to-be: Prince Albert II of Monaco and Princess Charlene are expecting their first child in December .

"By . Ruth Styles . From free money donated by the British taxpayer to paid-for trips to Magaluf, White Dee - real name Deirdre Kelly - certainly isn't short of freebies. Now the 16st mother-of-two has racked up yet another, after a clinic on Harley Street gave her a £1,000 'Lipoglaze' fat freezing laser treatment -  a procedure beloved of Binky Felstead, Amy Willerton and Kristina Rhianoff among others - for nothing. And not content with a single session, Dee says she'll be going back for further treatments and will even pay for them herself as she attempts to shave as much as six inches off her waist. Scroll down for video . Slimming down: Dee says she hopes to lose six inches off her waist following a fat freezing lipo treatment . 'I was about 21st a year and a half ago but now I’m down to about 16st,' revealed the 42-year-old, who says she has stopped claiming benefits - despite spending months defending her right to pick up disability money for depression along with a jobseeker's allowance. 'A few years ago, when my mum passed away, I was really suffering from bereavement and depression set in,' she continued. 'I would be eating in the middle of the night sometimes and my weight really went up. Since appearing on the TV, I have been better and have been eating healthier food and at better times. 'I’ve still got someway to go but clearly having the Lipoglaze treatment will help speed things along and give me a flatter tummy.' Lipoglaze works by freezing the fat . cells that lie beneath the surface of the skin, which die . after exposure to sub zero temperatures. Relaxing: Dee lies back and enjoys the treatment as her £1,000 procedure gets underway . On a diet: Dee says she's losing weight 'for myself' and not because of taunts from 'haters' Battling the bulge: Dee says she has lost five stone and now weighs a relatively svelte 16st . Over the following fortnight, the dead cells waste away and disposed of naturally by the body - resulting in between two and six inches of fat loss. 'I hope it’s the six inches off for me,' added Dee, who says she is 'looking forward to seeing the results over the next few weeks'. 'Clearly . this is just the start of losing the weight,' she added, 'and I’ve got to fathom . that out for myself but I’d definitely like to try it again for my . thighs and love handles - if I can afford it.' Despite being subjected to taunts about her weight after Benefits Street aired in January, Dee says her current bid to shed the pounds has nothing to do with 'haters' and is entirely for herself. 'The abuse is mainly because of the benefits or . because of my weight, but I didn’t have the Lipoglaze treatment because . of the haters, I had it for me,' she insists. 'I’m not interested in what those types of people think of me, only my friends and family’s opinions count to me. 'My . kids do joke that I’ve got bingo wings but they only say it as a joke . and it doesn't bother me, but maybe I’ll come back and have Lipoglaze on . them next.' She added: 'The thing why this treatment is so amazing is that it targets the bits . of fat that are really hard to shift, like your tummy, love handles and . bingo wings.' New life: Dee says appearing on Channel 4's Benefits Street has changed her life for the better . Her new life as a reality TV star turned Magaluf club promoter is a far cry from her previous existence as a benefits mum, and Dee says it's all down to appearing on the Channel 4 documentary. 'If you’d said to me that I would be having this treatment in Harley Street a year ago, I would have laughed,' she says. 'I thought that going to a Harley Street clinic isn’t something that the likes of me could enjoy but things have changed for me so much and I now know that anyone can do this if they set their mind to it. 'Just on a regular month with no school uniforms to buy I would be spending £200 a week on fuel, groceries, travel and kids clubs, so a luxury like this would never have happened. 'It’s amazing that since the TV show I can have opportunities like this.'","White Dee - real name Deirdre Kelly - shot to fame earlier this year .

More than 200,000 people applied for the Mars One project, hoping to be one of the first four people to travel to Mars and begin setting up a sustainable human colony on the red planet. Ms McGrath, 44, has made it to the top 705 candidates and in the coming months she is set to begin the next round of interviews to see if she suitable for the mission, which will leave in 2024. Ms McGrath has no reservations about the fact that if she is chosen, and if the mission is successful, she will die on Mars. Ms McGrath, 44, has always been adventurous and has run ultra-marathons and cycled 1233km from Adelaide to Perth . 'I think that adds to the excitement,' she told MailOnline. 'I'm going to die here on Earth if I don't go to Mars anyway.' Ms McGrath, a former public servant who also worked in marketing in the pharmaceutical industry for 12 years, was drawn to the project as soon as she read about it. 'I just thought that would be amazing, just the most cool adventure ever,' she said. 'I like pushing myself to my extremes both physically and mentally. My attitude is I'll have a go at anything once.' Her friends and family were totally unsurprised when they heard she had applied. 'They were completely supportive,' she said. 'I suppose the immediate response was ""Oh my God, good on you Di."" 'And then other people started thinking ""Oh my God how you will live without your hairdresser"".' Ms McGrath applied for the program before telling her partner of 11 years, Michele, who just laughed when she finally came clean. 'She must have seen it somewhere as well so her attitude or comment was ""Yes, I saw that and of course you would apply for that."" 'I'm quite a lucky person, I win things in competitions, I've won holidays and things so when I entered and she found out she said ""Because you win things you will win this and you'll get to go"". Ms McGrath sent a video application off in October last year and in December she found hout she had been shortlisted to the top 1058 . After a round of medical tests she was again shortlisted to the top 705 . 'It's nice to know she has that faith in me.' But the road ahead is going to be grueling. If Ms McGrath makes it to the final 24 – six teams of four will train up until 2024 but only one will leave – she will have to train for eight years without knowing for sure that she'll be getting on the ship. 'The other [teams] have to train just in case because they can't replace an individual they have to replace the whole team,' she said. The process will involve a lot of assessments to test her intelligence, knowledge and personality. In 2012 Ms McGrath sailed on a replica of James Cook¿s ship the Endeavour, circumnavigating Australia from Albany in Western Australia to Lincoln in South Australia . If she makes it to the groups of four she will be put in a team of two men and two women from different regions around the world. The aim is to start a colony that will produce its own oxygen, water and food and will waste as little as possible. 'We will create a bit of a new planet which is almost like a small version of United Nations, with equality in race and gender,' Ms McGrath said.

"By . Ruth Styles . When little Bo Cornwell, three, blushed and turned bashfully into her father Matt's shoulder upon coming face to face with the Duchess of Cambridge yesterday, hearts melted all over the world. But her shyness came as a surprise to Matt who says that not only is Bo not normally particularly timid, she actually thought the Duchess was very beautiful. 'She can be shy sometimes,' says the professional sailor, 40, from Southampton. 'But after she met the Duchess, she said she thought the Duchess was beautiful and lovely. She was more scared of the men behind her!' Scroll down for video . Bashful: Bo Cornwell, three, turns shyly away into her father Matt's shoulder in Greenwich yesterday . 'The Duchess was complimentary about Bo's dress and said how beautiful the flowers were. She's very nice - she's just got that charm.' But while Bo's day might have ended on a high note, no one was smiling more than her father, for whom winning the America's Cup for Britain is a long-cherished dream. 'For a sailor, it's the pinnacle,' he enthuses. 'I grew up in a sailing family and it was always about the America's Cup. 'The real rockstars of my sport were doing it and I never thought that it might be me one day, but when I got the opportunity to take part in 2003, I jumped at it.' Unfortunately, his first taste of the America's Cup ended with GBR Challenge crashing out in the quarter final after losing to American catamaran Stars & Stripes. Job done: Despite her nerves, Bo managed to complete the job and hand the Duchess her summer posy . Big plans: Sir Ben Ainslie and the Duchess of Cambridge pose with the America's Cup in Greenwich yesterday . Proud father: Sailor Matt Cornwell has raced in the America's Cup but is yet to take home the trophy . That, however, will make victory taste all the sweeter should Matt, and his colleague Sir Ben Ainslie, take home the trophy in 2017. 'If you read through early history of the America's Cup, Brits . were so often there in the final and it's good to remember that,' he enthuses. 'Winning it in 2017 really would be one . for the history books and I think we've got technology and sailors here that are as good as anyone else's.' Known affectionately as the 'Auld Mug', the America's Cup was first offered as a prize by Queen Victoria in 1851, who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the Isle of Wight. After a schooner named America from New York took the trophy, which was made especially for the race by jewellers Garrard, the cup was renamed in its honour, and both trophy and race have carried the moniker ever since. Despite its British origins, the cup has never been taken by a British team, with the American's clinging on tenaciously to dominate the victor's roll of honour, although Swiss and Australian teams have triumphed in the past. 'A lot of good men have tried and failed to win it,' adds Matt. 'One of the reasons the cup has lasted so long is because it's so hard to win.' 'If you do win it, then you can take it home and you own it completely, which means you can then rewrite the rules and stack the decks in your favour, making it hard for anyone to take it from you.' Almost: Matt Cornwell and GBR Challenge see off an Italian boat in 2003 but crashed out in the quarter final . Sailing fan: The Duchess on an America's Cup catamaran in Auckland harbour where the 2003 race took place . One team which has done exactly that is current holders Oracle USA, a San Francisco outfit that has held the America's Cup since 2010, and were helped to victory last year by none other than Sir Ben Ainslie. Whether this year's contenders, Team Australia, can manage to wrest it from them is yet to be decided but Matt thinks Britain should be in with a good shout come 2017. 'In recent years, sailing hasn't had much support because it isn't a mainstream sport but we've . got a great opportunity with Ben [Ainslie] on board and that should give the bid a boost.' In the . meantime, he's working with Ainslie to get more supporters on side for . the 2017 bid for victory and says he is thrilled by the amount of . attention yesterday's launch garnered. 'The Duchess' involvement helped straight away in the obvious sense that it's already getting more attention,' he enthuses. Team: Matt (right) is competing alongside Sir Ben Ainslie in the Extreme Sailing Series 2014 . Victor: Sir Ben Ainslie lifts the America's Cup after winning with Oracle USA last year in San Francisco . Hopeful: Sir Ben Ainslie is fronting Britain's bid for an America's Cup winning team in 2017 . All smiles: Sailing fan the Duchess of Cambridge with the posy of summer flowers given to her by Bo Cornwell . 'It's all been very positive. It's also very much about being British and doing this for the UK - we want to get the support of the country if we can and having the Duchess of Cambridge on board really helps.' But while he's looking forward to getting back on his catamaran and competing in another America's Cup race, he's got another sailing fan to heave to with first - his small daughter Bo. 'I took her out for the first time the other day and I was almost more excited than her,' he beams. 'If she turned around one day and said, ""Dad, I want to be a sailor too"", then I'd be very pleased. 'I don't think I'd push them too hard [Bo and her brother Nate, one] but I'd give them all the support I could and I'd tell her that if you work as hard as you can, then you can achieve a lot in this sport.' For Matt and fellow sailor Sir Ben Ainslie, the next few years could prove very hard work indeed but the rewards for them - and for Britain - could be just as impressive.

The model banished her 'wobbly bits' for good and slimmed down from 9st 2lb to her ideal weight of 8st after Twitter users said she was 'chubby' following her stint on the Channel 4 reality TV show. And it wasn't just her weight that plummeted - her breasts got smaller, too, going down from 32GG to a 32FF. Scroll down for video . New body: Casey Batchelor, who shot to fame on Celebrity Big Brother, has slimmed down from 9st 2lb to her ideal weight of 8st after Twitter users said she was 'chubby' Results: Casey lost more than 3lb a week during a punishing month of training using Guildford's fitness programme . Now Casey has the super-sculpted stomach of her dreams as she prepares for her 30th birthday. Speaking about her weightloss, Casey said: 'I'm so proud of my tummy - Jessica Ennis, eat your heart out! 'I did so much work and have got in the best shape of my life. I felt I needed to go the extra mile with my 30th coming up in October. 'I'm going to be in my bikini for most of the summer and I was fed up with cruel comments on Twitter about how I looked chubby and overweight. No one can say that now. 'I’m so much more toned - I’ve got rid of all my puppy fat.' Biggest loser: Casey, pictured, left, now and, right, when she left the Big Brother house last summer, said she did so much work and has got in the best shape of her life . Ready to party: Casey worked out and followed a rigorous exercise regime to shift the pounds in time for her 30th birthday . Casey's weight problems started earlier this year when she starred in Celebrity Big Brother and put on almost a stone lounging around the house. She confessed: 'I hated the way I looked when I came out. If I put on weight, it shows - I had a puffiness around my face. 'I didn't feel good about myself and couldn't wear the kind of clothes that really show off my figure to its best effect. You could see my wobbly bits in the pictures - who wants big love handles hanging over their trousers?' Casey finally knuckled down with the help of fitness trainer Ian Guildford - the man behind Luisa Zissman's bikini body.

How she did it: Casey finally knuckled down with the help of fitness trainer Ian Guildford - also behind Luisa Zissman's bikini body . The star said a key factor in her success was Forza Supplements' Raspberry K2 diet capsules. She explained: 'I would take one just before I exercised every day. They gave me a little energy lift. They are also great for suppressing your appetite at weak moments. 'I'm a big fan of Oreos and I would always take one Raspberry K2 just when I was reaching for the cookie jar, and the urge to snack would go away.' Determined Casey lost more than 3lb a week during a punishing month of training using Guildford's fitness programme. Looking for love: Casey is now on the hunt for a man and says she's been single for five years now . She said: 'It was incredibly tough - I had 15 different exercises which I'd do for a minute each. I paid particularly attention to my stomach. 'I did a lot of leg raising exercises while in the C-position - that is sitting on your bottom with your body in the shape of a C.' Casey completely changed her diet, too. She said: 'I was a sucker for carbs before, but they all went - bread and my favourite pasta. Instead, I ate lots of fresh fish and salads.' Now, as her 30th approaches, Casey has the body of her dreams - except for her breasts. 'I would like to have a lift,' she explained. 'I don't want my boobs to be dangling around my ankles when I get in my 40s!' Casey has real body confidence as she prepares to shoot her new calendar. Just one thing would complete her happiness - a man. Casey, who has been previously linked to Will.i.a.m, insists that she has been single for the last five years. She . said: 'Don't get me wrong, I've dated in that time, but I've not been . in a serious relationship for five years. It's about time that changed.' She's already flaunting it! Casey is so proud of her new figure, she was keen to showcase it as she posed for photographers at the Malibu Airways: Pina Colada National Day pre-party at the Disco club in Soho .

"By . Bianca London . She's the face of H&M, appeared in a film shot by Baz Luhrmann for Chanel and unveiled the World Cup, so it comes as little surprise that Gisele Bundchen is the world's highest earning model. But according to a new report, the 33-year-old, who's also a clothes horse for Carolina Herrera, Isabel Marant, Emilio Pucci and Balenciaga, has raked in a reported $47m (£27m) in the past 12 months alone. Forbes, who have ranked the Brazilian beauty as the world's highest earning model for seven consecutive years, claim that she earns £74,000 ($128,000) every single day thanks to her work with companies such as Falabella, a Chilean department store, and Fidelia, a Korean lingerie brand.

If corrected by US inflation based on the buying power of the dollar over time, that sum goes to some $427m (£249m). 'That does not include management, agent and attorney fees, but assuming Bundchen’s been managing her cash, spending wisely and making smart investments, which seems to be the case, it’s safe to say she has amassed a respectable net worth.'

To put it into perspective, Forbes say that is almost twice as much as Brazilian football ace Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima's estimated net worth. Gisele, who also has a line of sandals and lingerie range, is keen to keep her earnings private. Earlier this year she told MdeMulher in her native Brazil: 'It's sad, because the people who write these things don't have my bank account details.

She's found it quite a struggle to get on because it's a small dress. 'We're not a rich family. I'm not complaining with what I have at all, but this could be a great change in fortunes for us.

Fabulous fashion: Lorraine Kelly has been unveiled as a style ambassador for JD Williams, a clothing brand for the over fifties (coat, £85) JD Williams quizzed their customers on whose style they loved and Lorraine was the unanimous winner, with British men and women both saying they 'trusted' the presenter. Speaking at the launch of the range at London's Shangri-La hotel in the Shard last night, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'I'm thrilled that JD Williams have asked me to be an ambassador and you know what, I'm 54 and I absolutely love fashion. Embracing fashion: Lorraine, 54, says that older women are often neglected by the fashion industry, despite them representing a larger portion of the market, and hopes this range will help change that (dress, £50) How to look good over 50: Lorraine says that she has made key adjustments to pieces to ensure that they accentuate a woman's best assets (blouse, £29) Parisian chic: Lorraine says that this Burberry-esque trench is her favourite piece from the range because it makes her feel like a chic French lady (coat, £40) 'My mum is 74 and she loves fashion, my daughter is 20 and she loves it too. I've always said it's an area that we've neglected and shame on us.' Lorraine has lent her expertise to the brand and has provided the designers with advice on how to make clothes more flattering for over 50s - she's added sleeves to shift dresses and cuts to accentuate a woman's best assets. Research reveals that the over 50 female fashion market in the . UK is currently worth £2.5 billion per season, and is the fastest . growing fashion sector, so it is surprising that it is not better catered . for.

Confidence in fashion: Lorraine says that feeling comfortable in what you're wearing is the most important thing when it comes to getting dressed in the morning (left: blouse, £28, right: blouse, £29) Lorraine mused: 'These women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic, it doesn't matter what size or age they are, we have neglected them. I know this from my own experience, from talking to my mum and my viewers. The people that watch the show, I hope, will want to wear the clothes.' Lorraine said she had met many women her age who have struggled to . find clothes that flatter a slightly older figure while remaining . stylish. 'Fashion is all about feeling comfortable in your own skin and all of the clothes that I've chosen make me feel great,' she said. Speaking about the range, Toni Jones, editor of 30ishStylist.com, said: 'Lorraine is a brilliant poster girl for enjoying fashion in your fifties, she’s not afraid to experiment with colour and trends but sticks to classic and flattering shapes, which comes across in her first edit for the brand. 'She has chosen wearable pieces with a bit of a fashion edge, e.g. dressing up a cosy poncho with leather leggings, proving that you don’t need to try too hard to be stylish. No doubt this will encourage women stuck in a style rut to experiment a bit, and I’m confident the range will fly.' Showcase: Lorraine celebrated the launch of the range at the Shangri-La hotel in the Shard in London last night . Fashionable friends: Lorraine was joined by the likes of style guru Hilary Alexander as she presented the new range to press . Lorraine has already made a start on the designs for her SS15 range, which she says she's 'so excited' about. 'We ignore women sometimes,' she said. 'I'm proud of being 54, it's fine. When I was little, when you said you were 54 it sounded like you were a wee granny with a coat with one button and a tartan trolly you drag around. 'But that's all changed; in this day and age, we're feisty, fashionable and intelligent women who want more from life. We want to look great, feel great and this is such an exciting opportunity for me. 'Mature women....ignore us at your peril. We are a force to be reckoned with.' Lorraine for JD Williams is available in sizes ten to 32, with prices ranging from £20 for a jewelled jersey top to £150 for an embellished party dress.","The over 50's female fashion market is worth £2.5bn .

"By . Bianca London . It might be time to book in for that bikini wax if the latest summer trend is anything to go by. Yes, that's right, the infamous high-cut Baywatch-style bathing suit - made famous by Pamela Anderson in the 90s - is back with a vengeance this season. In the last month alone, one e-tailer has seen sales of the poolside apparel soar by 329 per cent - and there's a certain pop star to blame. Scroll down for video . Oh, Miley! Miss Cyrus, who has a penchant for crotch-baring garments, is behind the new trend . Leading . the charge for the ‘90s revival is wild child Miley Cyrus, who pioneered the revival of the silhouette when undergoing her radical transformation . from Hannah Montana to pop rebel. The creations Miley wore on her Bangerz Tour by Marc Jacobs, Roberto Cavalli and The Blonds, have clearly reignited a thirst for lycra in a variety of vibrant shades and prints. Australian rapper Iggy Azalea has also been championing the new trend, often opting for glamorous swimsuits by American designers Marco Marco and Betsey Johnson. Cameron Diaz is at it too, showcasing a sleek and sophisticated interpretation of the trend, appearing on the cover of this month’s Esquire magazine. Cameron exuded elegance in a jaw-dropping LBS (Little Black Swimsuit), perfectly accessorised with a pair of gold heels. Flesh flashers: Style queen Beyonce is also fond of wearing daring outfits on stage, which are making a comeback from the Pamela Anderson Baywatch days, right . How to wear it: Cameron Diaz gives us a lesson in how to pull off the new trend in style on the cover of August's Esquire . Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé are also fans of the one-piece and have recently made on-stage appearances in garments that caress every curve in an array of colours and cuts. The statement item is all part of the new 'pelvage' trend that's seen celebrities step out in dresses with hip-high slits that reveal the hip bones and pelvis area, marking the latest skin-baring red carpet trend - a portmanteau of pelvis and cleavage. Kendall Jenner, 18, caused a stir when . she appeared at the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto wearing a dress . that was slashed to her waist in June. 'Why do one slit when you can do TWO!?' she asked on Instagram alongside three shots of herself in the white embellished long-sleeved Fausto Puglisi gown. Underwear is optional . when showing pelvage, as Paris Hilton demonstrated at her 33rd birthday . party in February. Ms Hilton wore a fuchsia Alon Livne cutout gown that . left little to the imagination. It's a sell out! In the last month alone, eBay has seen sales of the poolside apparel soar by 329 per cent . Split personality:  Iggy Azalea and Anja Rubik have also embraced the risque trend . A spokesperson for eBay, who spotted the surge in sales, said: “The fashpack have spoken and this summer the bathing suit returns in an array of flattering cuts and colours.' Speaking about the trend, Lisa Haynes, Fashion and Beauty Editor of the Press Association, said: 'Gone are the days when swimsuits were deemed the more modest option over bikinis. This is a case of ""how high can you go?"". 'With the likes of Miley wearing uber high-cut bodies for performing, they've become more of a statement piece than swimwear you might go for a dip in. 'If you are taking the plunge, the cut will instantly elongate your legs. Apply the legs or cleavage rule and keep the swimsuit neckline high so you're limiting the amount of flesh on show. 'Only attempt this risqué silhouette if you've got the body confidence to pull it off - and a Brazilian waxer on speed dial.'

'Smoothies . are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients . which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume . food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates.

"By . Leon Watson . From buildings built by the Nazis to ornate theatres, burnt out hotels and eerie sanatoriums, these are the abandoned buildings that still litter the powerhouse of Europe. Photographer Daniel Barter, 30, from London travelled to the German capital Berlin and the surrounding countryside to capture buildings in need of work on film. Far from being resplendent in vintage glory, the deserted music venues and crumbling hospitals are a shadow of their former selves.

My interest in abandonments started really young. 'When I was five my junior school had a derelict aeroplane in an adjoining field. Two of my friends and I climbed over the 10ft green wire mesh fence and entered the plane. 'If I close my eyes I can still picture the switches, dials and smell the leather. 'I find abandoned buildings to photograph by word of mouth or a little bit of research. 'To gain access to some of the locations is quite another story and can involve a lot of climbing, sneaking and hiding. 'The best and most interesting thing about photographing abandoned buildings in Germany has to be the clash between different opposing ideologies that dominated this region in the mid to late 20th century. 'There is almost nothing else similar to it around the globe. 'The way it effected the material fabric of these lost places and the way it continues to effect the region as a whole, is I believe unique.'

However, those benefits are only realised when it’s . taught correctly and tailored specifically to the individual. Otherwise, . at best, yoga can be marginally helpful and at worst, dangerous. Copy Hilarias: Members of the public, Instagrammers and yogi enthusiasts are copying Mrs Baldwin's moves . Humble yogi brag: It isn't just celebrities who are taking to social media to show off their moves and their holiday settings . Anything they can do! Members of the public have started perfecting their show-off yoga moves on tropical beaches a la Gisele . What a view: It seems that our favourite smug health conscious celebrities seem to have lost sight of the difference between inspiring and just plain showing off . Getting high: Hilaria is at it again, this time posing on top of a giant chimney . She's at it too! Rachel Hunter shows off some casual yoga moves as she chills in a bikini in her local park . Limber: Ms Kerr, a serious yogi, makes this backbend look easy - but it is surely not . 'We all know that yoga relieves stress . and reduces anxiety. Between the deep breathing, flow of new postures . and positive affirmations, you’ll undoubtedly feel better for giving it a . try. 'However, yoga can over-use the wrong muscles when performed incorrectly. For . example, the hip-flexors are heavily recruited in many yoga moves. 'Women naturally tend to carry their weight . too far ‘forward’ and have a tendency to over-arch the lower back . because the hip-flexors (the muscles that help us raise our legs) are . too tight (sitting at desks all day doesn’t help). We don’t want to . compound this potential issue. The good life: Two yogi enthusiasts show off their yoga pose of the day, with a fairly average backdrop . A spot of sightseeing: One Instagram user uploaded this snap with the caption: 'Reaching for the sky using my yogis tools: mentally, physically and spiritually #yoga #handstandsworldwide #handstandseverywhere' 'To get the most ""bang for your buck"", instead of yoga, women are better served improving core stability, fixing postural imbalances and improving their strength through resistance training and metabolic conditioning.' 'Overall - if you like the sound of yoga, have no glaring postural issues . or musculoskeletal injuries and want to see what all the celebrity fuss . is about, there’s no harm in finding a decent practitioner and having a . go. 'Be sure to remember however, that . yoga is just one of a number of . elements that a holistic health, physique transformation or sports . conditioning exercise program should contain. Other areas, like . resistance training for strength and metabolic conditioning for fat . burning, are where you should invest most of your effort.' Balanced approach: Yoga, as demonstrated by Lea Michele here, takes careful instruction and coaxing into positions . What's going on here then? Hilaria shows off some more zany yoga moves, this time seemingly posing with a workman's hose in the centre of New York . The new cultural stalwart is drawing ire from the yoga community, which . claims that these celebrity yoga snaps are nothing more than a publicity . stunt and do little to promote the ideals of the ancient practice. Jennilyn Carson, a New York-based yogi who runs a site called Yoga-Dork, told the New York Post: ‘In a sense it mocks what yoga is.’ In . posting a photo and inadvertently seeking followers’ fanfare, the likes . of Ms Carson believe that celebrities negate yoga’s original purpose. Mrs . Baldwin has spoken out in defence of her yoga photos, arguing that such . 'harsh judgments' make for the most un-yogic behavior possible. She . wrote on Twitter: 'True yogis dont make harsh judgements. So my advice . to the haters: get on your yoga mat & breath & feel, until you . make peace with diversity. [sic]' Stairway to enlightenment? Some experts say that Hilaria Baldwin's Instagram yoga poses are nothing more than a publicity stunt . Rich Sturla shares his views... Rich Sturla, Owner and Director of Personal Training at Results Health and Performance . Yoga can be good for the brain. Advocates of yoga and . meditation say it’s great for your mind. Yoga is claimed to boost your . memory, help you focus and increase the blood flow to your brain. Yoga rarely differentiates between good and bad range of motion. Certain joints in our body - the ankles, hips, and upper back for . instance - require more mobility training because they’re too . stable/tight. Conversely, some joints – notably the lower back and . shoulder joint – require a lot more stability training because they’re . too mobile. Every joint in our body is designed to function with a . delicate balance of mobility and stability; some need more of one than . the other. My main concern with yoga is the tremendous amount of . lower-back bending that occurs; this is the last thing you want if you . have back pain. Most back problems arise when we get too much movement . in the lower back because we lack mobility in the hips, or our core and . glute strength is too low to prevent excessive arching or flexing of the . lower back. Yoga can over-use the wrong muscles when performed incorrectly. For example, the hip-flexors are heavily recruited in many yoga moves. Many of us spend all day sitting at a desk; as a consequence our hip-flexors are stiff and tight, and need releasing rather than extra stiffening/strengthening. Excessively limber people get . injured with ordinary activities like carrying groceries, and can easily . break down in sports and worsen existing aches and pains if applying . advanced yoga moves in the wrong areas of the body. There are more effective ways to invest your exercise time. Most . of us lead very busy, modern lives. We want to look, feel, move, and . perform at our best, and improve our health, physique or sports . conditioning in the most time-efficient way. Most women already have . enough flexibility. I believe targeted dynamic mobility work and . corrective exercises will give a lady all the flexibility she needs. To get the most ‘bang for your buck’, instead of yoga, women are better served improving core stability, fixing postural imbalances and improving their strength through resistance training and metabolic conditioning. Consistency, effort and determination in these areas are what get results. For more fitness tips, visit Rich's website here.","Stars have been showing off yoga moves on Instagram .

"By . Bianca London . Having graced the cover of Sports . Illustrated and Vogue and appeared in countless glossy fashion and beauty campaigns, Kate . Upton knows a thing or two about looking good. So it comes as no surprise that the supermodel has been snapped up by Gillette to be their glamorous new spokesperson.

'Spoiler alert, hairier isn’t better, so use a tool that can keep everything trimmed up nicely.' As we enter sunbathing season and with the high street awash with super short swimming trunks, we asked Kate what she thinks of men like TOWIE's Bobby Norris flashing so much flesh, Kate said: 'I think if you’re bold . enough to wear something like that then go for it! I think these . fashions have done wonders for male grooming - guys are taking care of . their body which I appreciate.' Kate shared her views on manscaping and whether she prefers a rugged man or a . more groomed metrosexual, saying: 'I think grooming is really important . in a guy’s overall look because it says a lot about someone if they care . about their appearance. Clothes to match the sky: Kate makes the most of the sunny skies in London by posing on a rooftop for her new campaign, revealing that she has a pretty low-maintenance beauty regime . 'I like a . guy to trim and shave below the neck and guys should definitely care . about us girls enough to do that...I mean, we groom.' Kate, who prefers the natural look on herself, also opened up her make-up bag to reveal how she gets that 'low maintenance' glow. She said: 'I love Bobbi Brown mascara and moisturiser so . those are always in there. I also always use lip balm so I make sure I . have one with me wherever I go.' Lending a hand: The 22-year-old has offered a female perspective to help men get beach-ready this summer and says she loves it when men are groomed .

She is also a huge fan of one of Britain's favourite sports; tennis. 'Yeah, I love tennis,' she said. 'My whole family enjoys the game. I wish I could have made it to a match.'

'She . not only represents beauty - although I think all women are beautiful - . but she has incredibly good energy. She is happy, she is strong, she is . smart, she is open, and she is really versatile.

"By . Bianca London . Her creations became a hit with . A-listers, including Victoria Beckham and Princess Diana, and in 1998 a . pair made their way into the script of Sex And The City - turning Jimmy . Choo into a household name overnight. After leaving the luxury label that she founded and managed between 1996 and 2011 - she sold her shares for £82.5 million - Ms Mellon has unveiled her very own collection of totes, ready-to-wear and, of course, shoes. And there's a certain piece in her collection that is really causing a stir: her £1,595 'Sweet Revenge' leather legging boots - which have been worn by none other than Kim Kardashian, teamed with a Givenchy leather ruffled skirt. Debut shoe: Tamara Mellon, who left Jimmy Choo in 2011, has unveiled her £1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge . Would YOU dare to wear them? The legging boots are being sold on high-end fashion site, Net-a-porter, and Mellon says they're 'flying off the shelves' The . £1,595 leather legging boots are a far cry from a dainty pair of Choos. Mellon describes her leather creation as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging. You can wear a sweater over it or a big man's shirt and there's no gap.' Net-a-porter, which is selling the shoe/legging hybrid, writes: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette, each size of this unique style is constructed with either a XS/S or M/L pant - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take.' In an interview with Times2 yesterday, Mellon says the boots are flying off the shelves and while the buyers are mostly young women, one lady in her late sixties snapped up a pair. Daring: Mellon (L) describes her leather creation (R), which is a far cry from a dainty Choo, as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging' The capsule collection also includes a . £725 leather tote, £550 stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants and £830 . fringed wrap-effect leather skirt. And her designs are winning over the fashion world: she's set to open her . online shop in Britain and she's planning on opening outlets in London . and New York next year before expanding into Europe and the Middle East - . Cheryl Cole even wore a pair of her snakeskin metallic blue sandals at . the X Factor auditions in Manchester. Her debut range comes soon after Mellon told how her business . partner did not design a single shoe for the multi-million . dollar brand named after him. The businesswoman has re-released her memoir, In Her Shoes, in a paperback version. In it, Mellon opens up about her life in the fast lane and reveals the business and life . lessons she will pass onto her daughter. During an interview last year on the Today . show, the 46-year-old revealed that she never received a sketch from . him during the years they worked together; 'Not one', she clarified. Of course she's wearing them! Kim Kardashian, who has a penchant for leather, has been spotted wearing the quirky design . Unaware . of Mr Choo's lack of design nous when they joined forces, she said that . she had to quickly hone her skills and use experience from her fashion . writing days as accessories editor at Vogue to guide her. Noting her increasing bitterness about the situation, she writes in her memoirs: 'By the end of 2000, Jimmy Choo was turning a profit of around £3 million a year. 'We had our own London boutique and were represented at 450 more stores, including Harrods and Selfridges. 'To top it off, we'd won a British Fashion Council Award, which Jimmy insisted on accepting on our behalf, even though his design contribution had been nil' Work the look: Net-a-porter, who are selling the shoe, write: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take' Not a design man: Ms Mellon said that Mr Choo, seen with a fashion student, was a skilled cobbler but lacked creative spark . Design process: Ms Mellon said that she would . come up with ideas and Mr Choo's niece, Ms Choi would sketch them out . and the two of them would go to vintage stores to look for inspiration . Ms Mellon said from . there her relationship with Mr Choo deteriorated to the point that any . conversation was 'out of the question'. In my shoes: Ms Mellon offers a glimpse into her eventful life in her re-leased memoir, In Her Shoes . In 2001, after much confrontation, Mr Choo sold his share in the company in 2001. Ms . Mellon, who remained with the firm until 2011, said the years that . followed were tough as she dealt with the death of her father in 2004 . and a divorce from her 'playboy' husband in 2005. While . it might have been more sensible for Ms Mellon to have gone into . business alone, she admits that she met Mr Choo after going through a . rough period in her life. 'One glass of wine for me turned into 6 o’clock in the morning and calling the coke dealer and then realizing, ""Oh my God, I've got to be at work in three hours,'"" she recalled. After losing her job at Vogue at the age 27, Ms Mellon entered rehab. The experience marked a turning point for her. She emerged determined to pursue her dream of starting her own shoe business. That’s when she reached out to Mr Choo, a cobbler from London’s East End whom she knew from her Vogue days. Today, armed with a wealth of business experience, she has finally unveiled her own namesake label - and Tamara says she’s the happiest she has ever been, and credits much of it to her daughter Araminta, 12. Despite . not even reaching her teenage years yet, Araminta - known more fondly as 'Minty' - is wasting no time . learning the ropes so that she can one day follow in her mother’s own . fabulous footsteps. Like mother, like daughter: Tamara Mellon, right, and Araminta Mellon, left, at a film premiere in June. Mellon says her daughter loves fashion and has great style . ‘She travels everywhere with me and sits in on all my meetings,’ Mellon tells MailOnline. ‘She’s learning about what I do from osmosis, from actually doing it. And I think that’s the best education. It’s giving her confidence and experience. She’s very smart. If she has an idea, she contributes.’ She continues: ‘My daughter and I bond over the business and decided, together, she’s going to travel with me and be in on my meetings. ‘It’s such a great way for us to bond. I love having her with me, I hate leaving her behind.’ Whether Minty will take over the reigns from her mother one day is still to be decided, however. ‘It’s a little early still,’ laughs Mellon. ‘But she loves fashion. She’s got strong opinions, which I like. 'It’s very good, though I don’t get a say in what she wears. Unless she asks for my advice, I stay out of it! ‘If there was a stage that she was wearing really inappropriate clothing then I would put my foot down, thankfully we haven’t hit that bridge yet!’ Famous fan: Cheryl Cole, who is one of Britain's favourite style icons, wore a pair of Mellon's £825 shoes at the X Factor auditions in Manchester .

"By . Leon Watson . The mother of a New York day trader who went missing in Mexico while travelling the world is demanding answers after human remains were found near his motorbike. Harry Devert, 32, left New York for a transcontinental motorcycle journey, only to disappear on January 25 in a deeply troubled region. Earlier this week it was revealed partially-buried human remains had been found near his rusting green Kawasaki motorbike. Ann Devert, of Pelham, New York, has travelled to the state to find out what happened to her son, but so far authorities have not revealed their findings. Harry Devert went missing after starting a lengthy road trip on a motorcycle that would take him across the U.S. and through parts of Central and South America . Devert, who held both French and U.S. citizenships, was an adventurer who had already spent five years traveling through Europe and South Asia . Campaign: Mr Devert left a comfortable life in New York for a transcontinental motorcycle journey, only to go missing January 25 . Jackie Burrell a family friend of the Deverts told  that Mrs Devert was working with the U.S. Embassy, French Embassy and Mexican authorities during the search for her son. 'She's down there and she continues the search,' said Burell. 'This is not confirmed. She's in complete control, she wants answers.' Mrs Devert's lawyer Darren Del Sardo said: 'She's remaining optimistic and you know as she's doing the best she possibly could in this very trying time. 'There's still many questions unanswered. She's trying to act on a serious lead, where in [his] motorcycle was found or to get some sort of closure if in fact the remains are Harry's.' Mrs Devert said  authorities took photographs of the motorcycle, including its vehicle identification number, or VIN, which matched his. Wild times; Mr Devert said he had previously been threatened with a gun in Venezuela . Adventures: Harry Devert on the motorbike he bought to drive across Mexico. He vanished in the dangerous Michoacan state. A body found next to his abandoned Kawasake has not yet been identified . A sudden break has come in the case of missing New Yorker Harry Devert, an adventurer who vanished in Mexico . Local police say they found a body wrapped in plastic next to Mr Devert's abandoned motorcycle . The Pelham man quit his job in order to follow this route through America, which was posted on his travel blog . Risks: Mr Devert is a seasoned adventurer who had previously traveled around the world for years . Mr Devert, who held both French and U.S. citizenships, was an adventurer who had already spent five years traveling through Europe and South Asia, keeping friends and family up-to-date on his website anewyorkertravels.com. One blog post begins like this: 'I’m the owner of a big smile and a broad taste for adventure.' The last his girlfriend heard from Devert was on January 25. He'd visited a monarch butterfly reserve in Michoacan state, home to a powerful organized crime group, and was headed to a beach on the Pacific coast where the final scene in the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption was filmed. The beach is in adjacent Guerrero state. A statement from the Guerrero office of public security Friday morning said authorities found the abandoned motorcycle along a dirt road leading to La Majahua beach in the township of Union Isidoro Montes de Oca. The statement said authorities also found '10 packages of what appeared to be narcotics (marijuana and cocaine)' near the motorbike and body. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said issued a brief statement: 'We are aware of the news reports that indicate a motorcycle and human remains were discovered in the state of Guerrero near the town of Lagunillas and are working closely with the authorities to get more information.' 'They’ve been great. Especially now that they’ve gotten something solid to go on,' she told me. Harry Devert was heading for Brazil on his lengthy motorcycle journey, hoping to catch part of the World Cup soccer tournament, which ends this Sunday in Rio de Janeiro. He was a 'mega' fan, his mother noted. 'He would come out of the jungle to see a game by Barcelona or Real Madrid,' she said. Devert said she believes the remains may be of her son but is holding out hope that a crime gang could have launched a 'subterfuge' to delay a pending raid on a ranch known to hold kidnapping victims. 'I’m saying 55 (per cent) that it is Harry, but I’m holding on to that 45 (percent),' she said.","Harry Devert, 32, went missing in a troubled area of Mexico on January 25 .

"By . Leon Watson . A teenager has been accused of breathtaking arrogance and a 'lack of human feeling' after being caught parking across two disabled spaces. John McNamara, from Limerick, Ireland, pleaded guilty  to parking in a disabled zone on January 4. His defence solicitor Tara Godfrey said the married father-to-be was only going to the town's cinema to watch a film in the evening thinking there were no restrictions at that time and parked badly. Scroll down for video . @Extremely sorry': John McNamara, from Limerick, Ireland, was accused of breathtaking arrogance and a 'lack of human feeling' after being caught parking across two disabled spaces (file picture) 'He thought it was alright to park in the disabled spot there at that time of the evening,' she said. Ms Godfrey said Mr McNamara had tried to park in one disabled spot but strayed into another. However, after hearing the cinema had disabled access, Judge Patrick Durcan was enraged. 'In other words, he prevents two potential disabled patrons attending the cinema in two parking bays which are located close to the cinema,' he told Ennis District Court. 'The arrogance, the ignorance, the selfishness and total disregard for others is breathtaking.' The 18-year-old, who had no previous convictions, was banned for the road for five months and handed a 500 euro fine, the Irish Independent reported. The incident happened at a cinema in Parnell Street, Ennis, south-west Ireland. Mr McNamara tried to park in one disabled spot but strayed into another . Ms Godfrey said McNamara left school at 16, got married at 17 and has one child on the way. 'He doesn't come across as being a bad lad and he is from a place in Limerick where things would have been very tough,' she said. 'It would have been very hard for him to get to this stage without previous convictions.' Ms Godfrey added: 'Mr McNamara has been honest with court, is extremely sorry and genuinely believed that as he didn’t have to pay a car parking ticket at this time of the evening, that he could have parked anywhere in the car park. 'I am asking for leniency. This has been an entire education for Mr McNamara.' Judge Durcan said: 'I would ask that Mr McNamara reflect on his attitude and chance his attitude to society generally.' The judge had earlier imposed a two-month ban on Iwona Zaton, of Ennis for parking in a disabled space in Ennis on January 14.","John McNamara, 18, from Limerick, admitted parking in a disabled zone .

"By . Leon Watson . Bakery chain Crumbs has revealed it has closed all its stores with immediate effect. The New York-based cupcake and coffee shop, which has 48 stores in 10 states, broke the news yesterday afternoon with a phone call to employees. They were given just a few hours' notice they were losing their jobs. Scroll down for video . Closed: New York-based cupcake and coffee shop has closed 48 stores in 10 states . 'It’s a real curveball for us,' a manager at the Crumbs in Brooklyn Heights said. 'Normally, you get two weeks' notice when you’re closing down — you don’t get one-day notice.' The company, which had already closed a number of its stores in recent months, said in a statement, 'Regrettably Crumbs has been forced to cease operations and is immediately attending to the dislocation of its devoted employees while it evaluates its limited remaining options.' Those options could include a bankruptcy filing, the spokeswoman said. As of the end of last year, Crumbs, which opened on the Upper West Side in 2003, listed 165 full-time employees and about 655 part-time hourly employees as working in its stores. Crumbs listed on the stock market in 2011 at the height of the cupcake boom. Crumbs posted a loss of $18.2 million last year, layered on a loss of $10.3 million in 2012 . Employees were given just a few hours' notice they were losing their jobs . Crumbs made its mark selling 4in, frosting-laden cupcakes in flavors such as cookie dough, caramel macchiato and red velvet cheesecake, costing generally $3.50 to $4.50 each. But the popularity of high-end cupcakes has sunk in recent years with competition from chains such as New York's Magnolia Bakery and Los Angeles-based Sprinkles. Trading of Crumbs shares on the Nasdaq index were suspended on July 1 after the company failed to meet a requirement of either having at least $2.5 million in shareholder equity or meeting benchmarks for its market cap or annual net profit. Crumbs posted a loss of $18.2 million last year, which followed a loss of $10.3 million in 2012, according to securities filings,The Wall Street Journal reported. The company's cash on hand fell to $893,000 at the end of 2013, down from $6.3 million the prior year.","Bakery chain Crumbs broke the news with a phone call to employees .

"By . Leon Watson . These are the charred remains of hundreds of hundreds of fuel tanker trucks targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The blaze was triggered by a sticky bomb on the outskirts of the Afghan capital, prompting angry drivers to block a major highway to demand reimbursement for their losses. Hundreds of other drivers stood by helplessly on Saturday morning, unable to salvage any property as flames and smoke rose from the area and several fire engines rushed to the site. Burned-out fuel trucks are seen following an overnight attack by Taliban militants in Chawk-e-Arghandi on outskirts of the Afghan capital Kabul . The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the militants were targeting fuel tankers belonging to Nato forces. 'We couldn't tell if the attackers were Taliban or other people,' one of the drivers, 35-year-old Juma Gul said. 'They were dressed in uniforms we couldn't understand what was happening. They were shooting toward the drivers and they were setting the tankers on fire. 'The gunmen were targeting any of the drivers who wanted to return to their trucks.' Flames rise from oil tanker trucks after an attack by Taliban militants on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan . Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said about 200 trucks caught fire late Friday and continued to burn through Saturday morning, but he did not confirm the cause or provide other details. The Interior Ministry said it has set up a team to investigate the incident.

"By . Leon Watson . Dean Harris who has been found guilty of murdering Amina Agboola, two, after becoming frustrated at her soiling herself . A man has been found guilty of murdering a two-year-old girl after becoming frustrated at her soiling herself. Amina Agboola, two, was found injured and like a 'rag doll' at her home near Peterborough after paramedics were called on November 21 last year. She died later that day after being taken to hospital. Her mother’s boyfriend, Dean Harris, 19, later admitted manslaughter, saying he had lost his temper and kicked her in the stomach, Cambridge Crown Court heard. Harris, 19, of Yaxley, denied murder . but was found guilty by a jury today after about two hours of . deliberations, Cambridgeshire Police said. Sarah . Racqueman, 29, also of Yaxley, was cleared of causing or allowing her . daughter’s death. She had already admitted cruelty to two other . children. Opening the trial, . prosecutor Zoe Johnson said: 'The evidence demonstrates that in the . period leading up to Amina Agboola's death, Sarah Racqueman was . repeatedly warned by professionals that Dean Harris posed a risk of . serious physical harm to children but she chose to ignore those . warnings. 'That was to prove, unfortunately, a fatal decision.' A post-mortem examination also found Amina’s liver had been split in two by Harris’s kick. The . court heard she was sent flying across the room. Harris initially told . ambulance crews she had fallen off a toilet, but later admitted this was . not true. While on remand, . Harris told a fellow inmate he was a 'psychopath' and confessed to . lashing out at her after becoming frustrated that she kept soiling . herself, Miss Johnson said. Miss . Johnson said the child was found 'limp and unconscious' in her pink . nightie, and one paramedic remarked that as she lay on the floor she . looked like a 'rag doll'. Her pupils were dilated, she was unresponsive and was struggling to breathe, she added. Her arm had recently been fractured, she had bruises to her face and skull and there were bite marks to her cheek and forearm. Police who searched the house after her death found there was an inadequate amount of food kept in the home. Two-year-old Amina Agboola was murdered by her mother's teenage boyfriend . Amina Agboola's mother Sarah Raqueman (left) was taking her oldest child to school when it happened . Jurors were told that Racqueman had begun a relationship with Harris, who lived next door, five months earlier. Social services had warned her that he was capable of violence, used drugs and had abused his former girlfriend. In his evidence, Harris told the court he had become 'a bit frustrated' on the morning of Amina’s death after repeatedly changing and cleaning her each time she soiled herself. Two-year-old Amina Agboola, from Peterborough, who was kicked to death by her brutal stepfather Dean Harris, 19, last November . Asked by prosecutor Zoe Johnson if he knew what he was doing, he said: 'To a certain degree yes. 'I did not intend to kick her. It just happened in a split second because I was frustrated.' Racqueman, who had previously been the victim of domestic violence, said her relationship with Harris had developed 'very quickly' after meeting earlier that year. She had allowed him to care for Amina because being a single parent could be 'stressful'. She said she had not allowed Harris to care for Amina since the warning but was 'not in my right mind' on the day she died. Racqueman said: 'The dog was barking, Amina was screaming and saying she didn’t want to go out. I was just in a daze.' Detective Chief Inspector Jon Hutchinson said: 'This was a truly horrendous case. Harris used completely disproportionate violence against such a tiny child. 'There is never an excuse to hit a child and he should have had no doubt what the potential consequences were of using such force on a two-year-old. 'His evil actions have resulted in the death of a young girl who had her whole life ahead of her.' The pair will be sentenced at a later date.","Amina Agboola died last November in hospital from 'internal injuries'

"By . Leon Watson . and Mia De Graaf . Spain is mourning 'the end of a generation' after its champion squad crashed out of the World Cup in the first round at the hands of underdogs Chile. And now, the disgraced players have to face the wrath of the internet. Within seconds of the final whistle, memes began swarming Twitter, mocking the side as 'the Titanic'. Scroll down for video... Ecstatic: This Brazilian fan could barely control his emotions as he held up a sign saying 'Goodbye [Spain]' 'Spain was the Titanic': Memes instantly started popping up on Twitter mocking the champions' early exit. This image photoshopped players onto a scene in the Titanic when the musicians vow to sink with the ship . Some have posted mock t-shirt sales, offering a Spanish strip for €4.99, adding: 'only worn twice!' Many poke fun at striker Diego Costa, who was born in Brazil but chose to play for Spain, writing: 'How many times can you change your nationality?' Spain's main newspapers also reacted with vigour. Headlines across the country scream: 'Spain was the Titanic', 'Goodbye to a golden generation', and 'End of the party'. While King Juan Carlos signed his abdication papers, making way for his son Felipe to take to the throne, almost as much space across the country's news sites and papers was dedicated to bemoaning the 'world tragedy'. 'Crash! The end of a unique generation,' sports newspaper Marca said. 'It was nice while it lasted,' sports newspaper AS said. 'The Spanish football team that has been the most deserving of a royal farewell ended its fairy tale in an atrocious way, in a world fiasco,' Spain's leading newspaper El Pais said. Insult to injury: This meme jokingly offered up a Spain strip for ¿4.99, adding: 'only used twice' Mistake? Brazil-born Diego Costa could have played for either side, both tipped to win, but chose Spain - and after the side's mauling spoof accounts started popping up mocking the forward's decision . The undisputed kings of global football in the last six years, Spain won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships and their first World Cup in South Africa. But their supremacy is no more and an ageing team needs to be rebuilt. Spain became the third champions in the last four World Cups to be eliminated at the first hurdle and their departure will almost certainly end the long international careers of their greats Xavi, Iker Casillas and Xabi Alonso. Polls are now running on a number of Spanish news sites asking readers 'who is to blame for Spain's failure in the World Cup?' Midfielder Andres Iniesta, who took the team to glory in 2010, said: 'It is a mauling nobody saw coming. We were at the very top and now we are at the very bottom.' Chile's fans were optimistic after Spain suffered a 5-1 defeat to Holland last Friday.

"By . Leon Watson . Needs round-the-clock care: Caren Paterson, 36, collapsed at home and had to wait 100 minutes for an ambulance . A scientist who was left brain damaged after waiting nearly two hours for an ambulance that was parked just 100 yards away has won £5 million compensation. Caren Paterson, 36, had collapsed in the bedroom of her flat in Islington, north London, in October 2007 and was beginning to breathe abnormally when her boyfriend dialled 999. He told the emergency operator that his girlfriend had fallen unconscious, that her lips had turned blue and that she was in need of urgent medical help to save her life. But because the address had been . red-flagged as 'high risk' by the ambulance service, a crew just seconds . away was ordered to wait for a police escort before attending. During the catastrophic delay that followed, Miss Paterson’s boyfriend rang 999 a further two times but still no help arrived. By . the time paramedics did reach Miss Paterson, who was working as a . genetic scientist at King's College, London, her brain had been starved . of oxygen, causing permanent damage, and she had also suffered cardiac . arrest. She survived but is now living in a specialist hospital and is in need of round-the-clock care. She suffers chronic amnesia, confusion and disorientation with the result she will never work again. Today, . Judge Richard Parkes QC approved a settlement against London Ambulance . Service NHS Trust consisting of a £1.4 million lump sum plus lifelong . annual payments. He paid . tribute to the support and devotion of Caren's mother, Eleanor Paterson, . from Warkworth, Northumberland, who was at London's High Court for the . hearing. Afterwards, Mrs . Paterson said: 'My daughter was a successful and ambitious scientist but . it is so distressing that all of her aspirations and ambitions have . been taken away from her because of her brain injury. 'I was determined to ensure Caren had access to the best possible care and support for the rest of her life and it is such a huge relief that the settlement has been approved today. 'Clearly we would rather not be in this situation at all and nothing will ever return our daughter to how she was before. But it is a weight off our minds to know that she will now be able to continue to receive the care, treatment and specialist attention that she needs. 'The thought of an ambulance crew sitting waiting round the corner while my daughter lay in her flat as her condition went from serious to life-threatening, causing irreparable damage to her brain, is still shocking and I hope no-one ever has to go through what we have.' Philip Havers QC, for the trust, expressed its 'sincere apologies' to the family for the shortcomings which had occurred and said it hoped and believed that the damages would go a long way to providing for Ms Paterson's needs in the future. Ms Paterson collapsed at her flat in Islington that she shared with her boyfriend who called 999 three times (file picture) Lawyer John Davis, of Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The failures by the ambulance service in this case were totally unacceptable and it was heartbreaking for her family to learn that an emergency response team was just around the corner but unable to give her the crucial treatment she needed. 'The emergency crews eventually arrived 102 minutes after the first 999 call - but even then there was nobody senior enough on hand to administer the treatment that Ms Paterson needed. 'It is imperative that people in Caren's condition are treated as quickly as possible - delays of even seconds can make a huge difference, let alone delays of well over an hour. 'We have been working with the London ambulance service's legal team to secure a vital settlement which will help to provide the lifetime of care and support she now needs. 'She is currently receiving specialist rehabilitation treatment at a unit in North Yorkshire and, in the long term, it is hoped that Caren can live in her own home with a team of well-trained brain injury carers so that she can establish a permanent routine which suits her severe disability.'","Caren Paterson collapsed in her flat in Islington in October 2007 .

"By . Jason Groves . Prime Minister David Cameron speaks at the Commonwealth Games Business Conference in Glasgow where he hailed the benefits of the EU . David Cameron yesterday pledged to ‘modernise and reaffirm’ Britain’s membership of the European Union, as one of his ministers said leaving was ‘not an option’. The Prime Minister, whose reshuffle last week promoted a number of Eurosceptics, struck a more positive tone about Europe yesterday, saying EU membership helps Britain ‘punch above our weight’. At a business summit in Glasgow before the opening of the Commonwealth Games, he said: ‘In a world … where we have got the rise of new powers in the south and the east, in a world of dangers and difficulties with terrorism … being part of these networks and organisations actually increases your ability to punch above your weight. ‘We need not to leave these relationships unmodernised. We need to make sure they’re working for us. So when it comes to the EU I think we need to modernise our relationship and reaffirm it. ‘But the membership of these networks - and I would include the Commonwealth in that - actually helps Britain to be a centre for business and enterprise and we should make the most of these relationships.’ Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017, following an attempt to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership of the EU. The Prime Minister insists he can secure enough change to recommend keeping Britain in. Tory right-wingers now want him to pledge that he will lead the ‘Out’ campaign if Brussels refuses to hand back significant powers. But business minister Lord Popat yesterday suggested there were no circumstances in which Britain should leave the EU. Speaking during a debate in the Lords, he said: ‘We need the European Union for trade and the European Union needs us so exit is not an option. ‘What is important is that we re-negotiate some of the reforms in the EU to make it more practical in terms of business and productivity.’ The PM has promised an referendum on Europe in 2017, after trying to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership, but a minister yesterday said there was no circumstances under which Britain would leave . Meanwhile, Nigel Farage yesterday began a reshuffle designed to woo disaffected Labour voters by tackling UKIP’s ‘men in blazers’ image. Former journalist Patrick O’Flynn was appointed as the party’s economic spokesman, while lawyer Steven Woolfe was appointed to the key role of immigration spokesman. Mr Woolfe said UKIP would introduce an ‘ethical immigration system’ based on a version of the points system used in Australia. But Mr Farage also promoted a number of less well-known names, including two women, in an attempt to broaden the party’s appeal and tackle the impression that the party is a one-man band. Actress-turned-MEP Louise Bours, a single mother, was appointed as the party’s health spokesman; Mike Hookem, a former serviceman and joiner, was made defence spokesman; former saleswoman Jill Seymour was handed the transport brief; and the party’s Liverpool-born deputy leader Paul Nuttall was put in charge of education and skills. A party source said the changes were designed to target the Labour vote, where UKIP has been making heavy inroads. ‘This is the end of the men in blazers image,’ he said. ‘These are people who don’t have cut-glass accents and who have made something of themselves in life. It is a departure for us. ‘It’s all about targeting the blue collar voters – it is moving the party on in a slightly different direction.’ UKIP has been buoyed this week by a poll conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft showing the party could seize at least two seats at the next election – Thurrock and Thanet South – because of its recent success in attracting Labour voters.","David Cameron has pledged an In/Out EU referendum in 2017 .

"By . Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor . Foreign Secretary: Britain will vote to leave Europe unless Brussels hands David Cameron major concessions, Philip Hammond warned yesterday . Britain will vote to leave Europe unless Brussels hands David Cameron major concessions, the Foreign Secretary warned yesterday. Philip Hammond said it was ‘pretty clear’ that voters will reject EU membership in a planned referendum in 2017 without changes being made. Mr Hammond, who replaced William Hague in last week’s reshuffle, confirmed he would vote to leave the EU – but insisted ‘substantive change’ in the relationship was achievable. He said other EU countries agreed change was needed. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the ‘status quo is not an acceptable way to run Europe in future’. Mr Hammond, arguably the most anti-EU Foreign Secretary the UK has had, added: ‘What I can tell, and have told my European colleagues, is that if the offer by European partners is nothing, no change, no negotiation, I am pretty clear what the answer of the British people in that referendum is going to be.’ He said there needs to be ‘substantive renegotiation, substantive change in Europe’. ‘My job now is to pursue that renegotiation. When we get to the end of that process and we can see what is on offer, what is on the table, we will then make our recommendation to the British people,’ he said. He added: ‘I haven’t changed my mind. If there is no change at all in the way Europe is governed, no change in the balance of competencies between the nation states and the European Union, no resolution of the challenge of how the eurozone can succeed and co-exist with the non-eurozone, that is not a Europe that can work for Britain in the future so there must be change, there must  be renegotiation.’ Mr Hammond’s comments confirm that his surprise appointment by Mr Cameron is designed to signal a distinct Eurosceptic shift, in an attempt to lure back Ukip defectors. Appearance: Mr Hammond said it was 'pretty clear' voters will reject EU membership in a planned referendum in 2017 without changes being made. Above, the politician made the remarks on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show . Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017 if he wins next year’s election – but only after attempting to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU. Many Tories are sceptical about whether he will be able to achieve major concessions. He has not yet said whether he will lead a campaign to take Britain out if he fails. Former Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke yesterday warned that the Tory debate on Europe had been hijacked by ‘right-wing headbangers’. Mr Clarke, one of a dwindling band of pro-European Tories, said that ambitious Conservatives ‘feel obliged to say they’re Eurosceptic’ in order to progress their careers. Politicians: Mr Hammond's comments confirm that his surprise appointment by Mr Cameron (left) is designed to signal a distinct Eurosceptic shift. Mr Hammond replaced William Hague (right) in last week's reshuffle . ‘I’m not saying every Eurosceptic is unintelligent, but there are some pretty daft ones given very great prominence,’ he added. Mr Clarke, 74, said he would stand for Parliament again next year, partly to help lead the cross-party campaign to keep Britain in the EU. But he warned that if David Cameron wins the election he could face a repeat of the  ‘lunatic civil war’ over Europe that wrecked John Major’s  government .","Philip Hammond said Britain will vote to leave Europe unless changes made .

"By . Tracey Cox . It takes three things to be good in bed: education, practical experience and the right attitude. But to truly earn your great-in-bed badge, there's one thing you must perfect: a signature sex move. What's this exactly? Well, only you know the answer to that one. It might turn out to be a totally original complex manoeuvre, known only to you and your lovers. (You've not only got it trademarked, your exes know if they so much as think of spilling your secret, you'll send the boys around.) Tracey says that a signature sex move can help you from go from being good in bed to great in bed . Or it could something as ingeniously simple as a twirl of the tongue, done with such panache, it defies description. Need a little help to work out your personal piece de resistance? All it takes is a little thought and (perhaps) a little practice. Four steps to finding your signature sex move: . Step 1: Decide what you're best at . The trick is to focus on whatever sex act you enjoy the most. If you like doing something, you're usually good at it – and if you're good at something, you usually enjoy it. So you can't really go wrong if you stick to this simple rule. If you could cheerfully massage all day long, for instance, there's your starting point. Teach yourself some sensual massage techniques, top the whole delicious experience off with some erotic genital massage and there you have it: a mind-blowing move they won't forget in a hurry. Step 2: Tap into your talent . Tracey says the best way to find out how your move is received is to practice it . Decided on an area you think holds promise? Try out a few different techniques before deciding on one to concentrate on. For the sake of this exercise, let's say you've decided to become the absolute master/mistress of oral sex. The next time you do it, ask for a running commentary of how different techniques feel. Get them to rate each and everything you do on a scale of 1-10. What happens when you focus on this part? What about that one? Now alter the pressure, carefully noting whether you're going up or down in the ratings game. What about in slow motion? Speeded up? Yes, it does take a few sessions to try it all out but I can't see your partner complaining, can you? Step 3: Ask around . Think you've found an erotic innovation that's uniquely yours? Do a quick survey of all your friends, go online (or watch all the old Sex and The City episodes) to find out how common it is and how well it's likely to be received. No need to confess what you're up to, just wait till everyone's had a couple and start a general conversation about what you want to be expert in. Say you read some quirky fact about it online (make it up!) and ask what they think is the best tip they've ever done/heard of? Make sure you ask a mix of same and opposite sex friends to get both perspectives. Step 4: Try it out! Let all the hints, tricks, tips and research merge into one spectacular sex session with your Iucky-lucky-lucky partner. At first, concentrate hard on combining everything you've learned, but once you're in the swing, relax into it and let your gut instinct guide you. After all, you chose this because you LIKE doing it, remember? Sneak a peek to see how they're enjoying the sensation. If you've done your homework and research, there's only one thing you'll see - utter ecstasy! Only one thing left to do now: give yourself a big pat on the back!

"By . Tracey Cox . We all know people who seem to have an endless list of lovers, but never want to settle with just one, plus there's no shortage of stars who seem to have a different partner very month. Taylor Swift's list of supposed suitors, for example still impressively long for a 24-year old (Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Connor Kennedy…) Which begs the question, are people like Taylor simply choosing wisely and carefully - or being picky? As a multi-millionaire, supermodelesque pop powerhouse, she has every right to be. Taylor Swift, seen here with ex-boyfriend Harry Styles, has a long list of past suitors for a 24-year-old, Tracey says that this could suggest that she is too picky . But if you're ditching partners for tiny reasons like, I don't know, their left toenail's not quite straight, being too picky can mean you've got zero chance of ever finding someone. As much as I hate to say this, it's a bit of a female thing. Ask a man what he's looking for in a woman and he'll say something like, 'Big knockers.' Ask a woman and she'll start counting off on her fingers. 'Well, he's got to be taller than me. And have great teeth, I can't stand guys with bad teeth. I could never date a guy who had those awful patches of hair on his fingers – and he's got to be blonde and make me laugh and . . .' Psychologists say it's because women expect more from relationships than men do. We don't just want a boyfriend, we want a lover, friend, playmate, career adviser, confidante, handyman, accountant, masseur, dishwasher and shrink. And that's an awful lot of skills to find in one person. Tracey says that holding out for Mr. Right can mean that you dismiss people too quickly, she says you should always go on three dates before ruling someone out . Most of us drop a few (hundred) things off our wish lists when it becomes painfully clear we'd need to date a football team to fulfil all of them – but not all women are willing to let go. Their wants remain etched in stone and they cling stubbornly to the belief that Mr Perfect is out there, they just haven't met him yet. Is this you? Count up the number of dates you've been asked out on in the last year. How many did you accept? A coffee with one guy out of seven? If this is you, I have a question: if you don't go out with very many men, how have you got the experience to know what sort of guy really would suit you? Tracey says try not to be put off by small habits that may irritate you and focus on the bigger picture . Saving yourself for Mr or Ms Perfect isn't just boring, it's actually stopping you meeting them. Most of us pick up ­relationship skills from every relationship we have, so the more people you date, the better at relationships you are. Plus, you need to be out there. True, your perfect match is going to turn up when you least expect it, in the least likely place, looking not at all like you expected. But they're not going to come knocking on your front door (though I do know a girl who ended up marrying the man who came to fix her ceiling fan – true story!). You're being too picky if... Dates accuse you of asking too many questions, too early . It's a date, not a job interview, and they're well aware you're fishing. Asking where they went to school is fine. Asking what their father does for a living and what sort of car they drive isn't. You've only ever seen your perfect partner on a movie screen . The chance of meeting Bradley Cooper is slim. The chances of him falling in love with you if you do are pathetically slim. Tracey says that a great way of recognising whether or not you're too picky is by gauging your friends reaction to your dream man . Your friends roll about in hysterical laughter when you tell them the type of person you're hanging out for . Tell them your five 'must have's' and see if they can keep a straight face. If they can't, you're being unrealistic (or, dare I say it, punching above your weight?) Your friend, who rates similarly on the attractiveness scale, goes out on ten dates to your one . The point here is rather obvious, don't you think? You discount people after the first date . Give them at least three before you make up your mind. First impressions are often wrong. You won't go out with someone because they're not your type physically . A wit as sharp as a razor blade, the ability to really listen to you, make you laugh your pants off – all can change your perception of how someone looks if you give them a chance. You refuse dates because of where someone lives, the car they drive, their salary or their clothes . You're not just being picky, you're a snob. Does the word superficial ring a bell? When it's sensible to be a fusspot . If you were abused . You may subconsciously pick ­potential abusers. It's wise to be cautious and screen new partners. If you've just come out of a long-term relationship and are feeling raw and vulnerable . Why cause yourself more pain by diving into another bad relationship? If you can't say no to anyone . You've been on 25 dates in the last two weeks and didn't really like or fancy any of them? Reverse all the suggestions I've made: you need to be more choosy, not less!

"By . Tracey Cox . It's National Orgasm Day, don't you know? Well, if you didn't know one thing you will be sure of (especially if you're female) is that reaching that magical point during sex isn't always so easy. For many, there's no problem but for plenty of women there can be obstacles in the way of reaching climax. Fear not though because there are ways to make sure that love making isn't boring and offers as much fun for you as it does your partner. Here's Sexpert Tracey Cox's tips for helping yourself out in the bedroom. Don't be miserable in the bedroom: Help yourself to orgasm by reading up on Tracey's top tips . Change your attitude . The most common obstacle to having an orgasm is your attitude to sex. If you’ve been brought up to believe it’s ‘bad’ or ‘dirty’ or even ‘unladylike’, you probably feel uncomfortable touching yourself or letting your partner touch you. The ‘good girls don’t’ inhibition factor is a big problem for some. Remember that sex and pleasure is normal and allow yourself to get carried away. Enjoy! If you really can't, do think about booking a few sessions with a female sex therapist (check out the Psychological Society) Accept you have to learn how to orgasm . Female orgasms aren’t automatic. You’re . not going to accidentally have one while doing the ironing. It’s also . extremely unlikely that you’ll have your first orgasm with a partner. Practically all women have their first on their own. So if you’re . waiting for some magical lover to transport you to heaven, stock up the . cupboards – you’re in for an awfully long wait. Instead, invest in a few . good sex books that focus specifically on the emotional barriers to . orgasm. Keep reading and researching until you feel good about sex, . confident that you understand how your body works and know the basic . techniques most women use to orgasm. Accept responsibility for your own pleasure . Do you think it’s his responsibility to ‘give’ you an orgasm?  No-one can ‘give’ you an orgasm; you have to ‘take’ one yourself, by guiding and telling him how to do it. It’s not like a five-course meal where he slaves in the kitchen and you get to do nothing but lie about until you’re ready to savour the results. Orgasms happen when both of you know what you want and how to get it. Teach yourself how to masturbate . You’ll learn more about your body and its response system if you use your fingers but using a vibrator is also a good idea. Any good department store sells personal massagers, ostensibly designed to massage shoulders but more often bought to massage clitorises. The saleswoman won’t know what you’re buying it for. Remember though, you’re not putting it inside but holding it against your sensitive parts. Also do teach yourself to climax using your hands. Unless you want to always use a vibrator with your partner, you need to know how to do it manually. Teach him how to do it . Once you’ve masturbated yourself to orgasm, it’s time to tell him how to do it otherwise how is he supposed to know what you like? God sex is your own responsibility - don't expect to be able to lie back and let your partner do all the work . Change how you see your own body . Many women don’t orgasm because they think their partners can’t possibly find them attractive and spend too much time thinking about that during sex, rather than focusing on what's going on. Let’s get one thing straight right now: an overwhelming majority of men are turned on by a naked woman’s body, no matter what shape it’s in. However, if you aren’t happy with yours, do something about it. Join a gym, get a make-over, eat healthily, then splash out on some new clothes. But accept what nature has handed out: ignore the faults, play up the good bits and learn to love every centimetre. Stop trying so hard . A watched pot never boils. Your mind should be focused on how pleasurable the sensations are, not on ‘Please God, let me have one’. The more you worry about it, the more your body will tense and make orgasm impossible. Try a bit of reverse psychology. When you masturbate or make love, tell yourself you’re not allowed to have an orgasm, that this session is strictly for ‘research’ purposes. You’ll relax more and may well end up scoring a goal. Tracey Cox knows it all when it comes to sex . Rethink your relationship . ‘You’re fat’, ‘No wonder you can’t have an orgasm, you’re no good at anything’, ‘You’re not a real woman’, ‘You’re frigid’ – if your partner says or insinuates negative things about you, your body or your inability to climax, getting rid of him is the simple solution to your problem. Tracey . has an academic background in psychology, has written 14 books on sex, . relationships and body language and has hosted many TV shows on these . topics across her career to date.

"By . Tracey Cox . One of the most fascinating parts of my job as a sex researcher is observing which facts about sex men and woman are willing to believe - and which they aren't. The most obvious example is the that only 25 per cent of women consistently orgasm during intercourse. This is something that's backed up by research over and over again but both men and women refuse to believe it. Tracey says that it is ridiculously unlikely for couples to climax together yet thousands of us still expect it . Neither of us wants to give up on the idea that the 'traditional' way of climaxing actually doesn't work (and men, in particular, don't want to believe their penis isn't all she needs). The other sex fact both sexes aren't willing to believe is that most couples don't have simultaneous orgasms. People on the telly and in movies come together more often than they have breakfast but it's a little different in the real world. Here's why. Roughly 75 per cent of men in relationships always have an orgasm with their partner, compared to only 30 per cent of women. Men's orgasms last anywhere between five and 13 seconds, women's last around 12 to 30 seconds. Tracey says couples should take it in turns to orgasm to make sure it's the best it can be for their partner . Do the maths and you'll quickly see that no sane bookie would ever back the odds of both of you orbiting into orgasmic ecstasy at exactly the same moment. It isn't just unlikely, it's ridiculously unlikely! Yet in bedrooms all around Britain, at precisely 10.37pm on a Saturday night (when couples are most likely to have sex, apparently), there you both are trying to achieve the virtually impossible. Isn't it more logical and less stressful to instead take turns to climax? It's not only easier to orgasm one at a time, it means we can focus intently on making sure it's the best it can be for our partner (rather than losing ourselves in our own yummy but inherently selfish orgasmic sensations). Tracey Cox says that couples shouldn't get hung up about climaxing at the same time and should focus on one partner at once . I vote we all give up on the 'wegasm' and think of it as a happy coincidence rather than likely finish. Instead, simply aim for stronger, more intense orgasms for both of you, hopefully in the same session. Here's some practical hints on how to achieve them: . Give her a head start. Women take longer than men to build up to the pre-orgasmic phase, so she gets double the helping of foreplay before you move onto the really intense bits. But give him foreplay too. True, some men aren't interested in foreplay and want to sprint to the finish line but they're the ones missing out.  A recent study published in The Journal of Sex Research found both sexes have the most satisfying climaxes when desire builds slowly and orgasm is close but delayed multiple times before finishing. Reposition yourself. If it's not working for you. Move hands, tongues or toys to where it feels best rather than wait for a partner to mind-read and hit the spot. Say something. Describe your fantasies to your partner during sex, talk about how you feel while they're doing what they're doing. Dirty talk doesn't have to involve dirty words, but saying anything sexy out loud nearly always intensifies the mood. Don't drink. Alcohol removes inhibitions but numbs the nerve endings, making it far more difficult to orgasm. Watch something. Prop up your laptop on the bed and take turns watching something sexy, like a steamy part of your favourite film, while the other does all the work. Don't stress if you can't climax. Dozens of factors affect our ability to orgasm: stress, tiredness, pregnancy, where you're at in the menstrual cycle, medication, alcohol, menopause. We're human, not robots so orgasm sometimes just doesn't happen. Use a vibrator. The quickest way to up the number of orgasms a woman has in bed is to bring the vibrator to bed with you both. Worried he won't like the competition? Research from Indiana University found 70 per cent of men aren't intimated by vibrators - perhaps because women who use them regularly report higher levels of arousal, lubrication, orgasm and satisfaction.

"By . Tracey Cox . There are certain qualities that make anyone appear attractive and all reduce to this simple equation: if you love sex and love people, you're probably sexy. All of us have a subconscious 'sexy' radar which automatically tunes in to people who've got 'it'. Our looks radar sets off first - instantly scanning for the best-looking person in the crowd - then the sexy radar clicks in, looking for more subtle (and surer) indicators that someone's worth talking to. Score all six of the following and it's guaranteed you're the girl getting the most attention - and guess what, it's really not about what you look like! Tracey says that showing enthusiasm is a great way to keep a guy's attention . YOU'RE ENTHUSIASTIC . Enthusiasm is infectious - you can't help but smile and respond to someone who's full of life. It doesn't really matter what it is you're passionate about, so long as you're throwing your arms around and getting excited about something. As one guy put it, 'The girl in the corner whose facial expression doesn't change and talks in a monotone isn't appealing, even if she's sprouting all her sexual secrets. It's the girl who's gesturing madly and talking a million miles an hour who you want. Even if she's discussing what colour to paint her bathroom.' YOU MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE HE'S THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM . Orlando Bloom just walked in, Jon Hamm is at the next table shirtless and the waiter just dropped a £100 bill at your feet but your eyes haven't moved from his face. The person who looks you directly in the eye, really listens, calls you by name and focuses on what you're saying wins every time. Tracey suggests keeping his gaze to make him feel like the only man in the room . YOU'RE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE . A person who isn't scared to express an opinion even if it's the opposite to everyone else's, might be called opinionated, stroppy or even rude, but there's one thing they'll never be branded - boring. Stick up for your beliefs and believe in yourself. We all respect and admire people who hold their head up and fight their own battles. YOU'RE NOT SCARED TO TOUCH . Never, ever underestimate the power of touch. The person who really hugs hello, who puts a concerned hand on your arm if you're upset, gives a firm handshake to say, 'Congratulations!' is making warm, sexy gestures that make them seem approachable. Tracey says a strong personality, even a moody or stroppy one, is far better than being boring . Don't forget to touch yourself too. Smoothing your stockings, pushing back your hair, hugging yourself if you're a bit cold - it's all very sensual and inviting and draws attention to whatever body part you're touching. If you're stingy with your affection, others assume you're cold, hard to get to know, uptight.None of which are adjectives you want applied to you, right? YOU'RE AWARE OF YOUR BODY - AND KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT OFF . The more you like your body, the better you'll present it to the world. Sit with your arms crossed, clutching a pillow across your stomach and the message is obvious: I feel fat and I'm trying to hide my stomach. A woman who does a big, lazy stretch, lifting her arms up, sends a very different message: I'm proud of my body. YOU'RE NOT LOOKS OBSESSED . It's hard to accept someone will find you sexy with a red wine stained mouth, mascara down your cheeks and hair askew but you'll still look a better than the girl who spends all night staring into her mirror. One reason why the just-got-out-of-bed tousled look never, ever goes out of fashion!

"By . Tracey Cox . If they weren’t in the middle of a ‘conscious uncoupling’, it sounds like exactly the sort of thing Gwyneth would go for. The 10-year marriage renewal is the latest 'in' thing - and not just with celebs, but us 'normal' people too. It does initially seem like a bit of a show-off-silly idea but, on reflection, I think it’s a damn good one. If you got married early - and by early I mean within the first 18 months (it takes at least three years before you really know someone, surely?) - you had no idea what you were getting yourself into. Tracey Cox says that renewing your vows after ten years is the perfect way of refreshing your relationship values . Pledging to 'love, honour and (does anyone really say this anymore?) obey' is a breeze when you're in the hormone-fuelled, crazed infatuation period because you’re blissfully unaware of what circumstances you’ll be doing any of this in. Ditto pledging to forsake all others when you’re both still on (semi-)best behaviour, firm in flesh and seeing a gloriously air-brushed reflection of yourself in each other’s idealistic eyes. That’s puppy love. Loving someone ten years in is real love. We talk about 'unconditional love' (I'll love you no matter what you do) but even mothers, the experts at this, struggle now and then. I think the closest thing you get to 'unconditional love' romantically is still loving someone after a decade of living and being together, seeing and accepting every quirk, habit and idiosyncrasy. That’s quite a compliment - and even more so if you’ve brought up children together and still able to smile rather than snarl first thing in the morning. Tracey says that renewing your vows is a great way of making up for a cheesy first wedding . There’s another bonus  to renewing vows that far in - you can write totally different ones.This time firmly grounded in reality...with loads of conditions attached. 'I promise to continue to love you IF you stop being a grumpy old sod when you’re stressed, tell your Godawful mother we’re not spending every Sunday of our lives listening to her carry on about the roast and lose ten kilos because it’s hard enough being a parent, let alone a single parent.' Just think of the sex clauses you could include! 'I promise to have sex with you on Saturday afternoons but only if you do all the dishes for a week beforehand and massage my feet for a minimum of 40 minutes a night. Each session is to be preceded by a minimum of half an hour of foreplay (to be specified depending on what I’m in the mood for at the time).' The more I think about it, the more I like it. Perhaps couples who don’t fancy forking out for another dress and splashing cash they don’t have, should stage their own little commitment ceremony in the lounge, where they hash out the terms and conditions for the next ten years during the ad breaks of Googlebox. Not a bad idea, eh? For those who do want to go the whole hog, these are the new ‘rules’ (apparently): . Good reasons to justify why you're renewing your vows ten years later: . Not so good reasons to justify it: . Renewing vows isn’t legally binding, so anyone can do it - your granny, your kids, any local celebrity you can rustle up. Don’t expect presents (no, you really mustn’t), don’t have fake ‘bridesmaids’ and ‘best men’ and don't even think about having a hen or stag do. They were bad enough first time around.

"By . Tracey Cox . It's been 16 years since Charlotte disappeared into the bedroom with her 'rabbit' vibrator on Sex and the City. Now more women in the UK own a vibrator than a washing machine. Sex toys have been a part of many women's lives for well over a decade - now it looks like men are about to muscle their way into the market. Tracey says that the male population are really starting to embrace the idea of sex toys especially using them with their partner . There's been a tenfold increase in the sale of male sex toys in the UK in the last decade. It's predicted to be the fastest growing sector of the industry in 2014, with a market worth £10 million in the UK alone. But we're not talking blow-up dolls here - in fact, the average man's motivation to buy a sex toy is far from sleazy or selfish. Easy access to informative sex education, a long overdue discussion of erection problems and a generation of women eager to explain the intricacies of their baffling sexual systems has finally had the desired effect. Men have grown up about sex, moved past the all-roads-lead-to-intercourse formula and (finally!) acknowledged the basic design flaw of the male/female sexual response system - that the clitoris is outside the vagina. The biggest selling male sex toy is the 'love ring' - a ring that fits around the base of the penis, holding the blood in the three spongy chambers that fill to make him erect. How is this a step in the right direction when it's still penis-centric? Tracey has launched a new range of male sex toys called Edge designed to improve male stamina in bed . A lot of the love rings have a little vibrator attached to them - and that's designed to bring her pleasure and attempt to even up the orgasm quota (currently running at about 4:1 in his favour). 'Strokers' - textured squidgy sleeves that slide over the penis and are then moved up and down by hand to intensify the sensation - are the second biggest selling sex toy for him. But far from being used solo, they're being used with partners as a exploratory couple's toy (75 per cent of buyers are in a relationship). Penis pumps, which create a vacuum to improve blood flow to the penis, ensuring healthy, firm erections, are another big seller. Men, traditionally dreadful at looking after their health, are realising that unless they want to be part of the current post-40 Viagra-popping generation, it pays to keep that part of their anatomy in good working order. Tracey says that men's interest in sex toys could also help improve sex with their partner . There was a reason why women wholeheartedly embraced sex toys, in particular vibrators - we need them. The vibrator is the most reliable route to orgasm for women; only 25 percent of women consistently orgasm during intercourse and about 20 per cent seldom or ever do. The humble vibrator is, without a doubt, the single most revolutionary device ever invented in terms of female sexuality. Without it, a large chunk of women would never experience an orgasm at all, let alone be able to teach their partner how to do it. (At least if you've had one, you have a clue what you're aiming for.) The surge of interest from men in sex toys is also a positive move forward because they're going for products designed to improve sex with their partner in a quest to keep sex interesting for both. Today's man wants to perform well and be well informed about sex, rather than cling onto sex myths that aren't based in reality and aren't serving either gender well. As most of you know who read my column regularly, I've been designing sex products for couples for years. I've always wanted to design a range for men because I've always felt men miss out when it comes to sex toys - the focus has been on women because vibrators are such big business. But I wasn't convinced men were quite ready and willing to invite devices that might just do the job better than they could, into the bedroom. Now they are. Let's hope the male sex toy phenomena is equally as influential on our sex lives as the female version. My new range Edge, is the world's first mainstream range of sex toys for men and is designed to improve men's performance in bed.

"By . Tracey Cox . We've all been there - you’re so keen on a new lover you’re practically frothing at the mouth if you’re apart for two days, but there’s no way you’re letting them know that until you’re damn sure they feel the same. So instead of asking (too humiliating), you set up little ‘tests’ to see how they perform. Tracey says we shouldn't test our partners by doing things like getting them to choose between us and their own social plans . They go something like this: . 'I went round to see Sarah last night,’ you say casually to your boyfriend, ‘and a guy called Steve was there.’ If he instantly launches into, ‘Who’s he? Did you fancy him? What did he look like? Did you talk to him all night?’ you get the info you’re digging for: he likes me as much as I like him. Never mind that Steve was Sarah’s six-year-old nephew. Or if you’re not sure what priority you are in his life, you’ll invite him to a romantic dinner for two on a planned boys’ night. He’s forced to choose between you or them, and God help him if he chooses the boys. Tracey says we should save our plotting and scheming creativity for our sex lives . We all test our partners to a point, but there’s a huge risk in deliberately setting up scenarios like these. Why? Because the person who’s doing the testing is usually the one who’s more committed to the relationship. If that’s the case, your partner will probably fail every test you set them and you could walk out on what could have been a great relationship. People don’t always fall in love at exactly the same rate. Some people fall fast and hard, others take time. He might not be in the slightest bit interested in who Steve is because he’s not as into you as you are him right now. Six months down the track might be a different story. And while most of us think our tests are a foolproof way to work out where their heart is, we forget about other circumstances. He might choose the boys’ night out simply because his friends are giving him grief for not being so available since he’s met you. Most partners fail the secret test without knowing they were being examined. When you test, the basic line is, 'If you loved me, then you’d…..'. You’re playing a guessing game with your partner forced to try to predict what will make you happy. But the more specific you are about what you do and don’t want in a relationship, the more likely you are to get it - and the happier your partner generally is. We all like to know what’s expected of us - it’s not only simpler, it makes it relatively easy to side-step potential pitfalls and rows. 'Most partners fail the secret test without knowing they were being examined. You’re playing a guessing game with your partner forced to try to predict what will make you happy.' Tests are nearly always manipulative. Driven by insecurity and a craving for some type of love declaration, they inevitably end up achieving the opposite. They create even more insecurity because it’s hit or miss whether your partner knows the ‘correct’ response. The best way to avoid testing is to be honest with yourself about why you’re doing it. If it’s a need to know where you stand with your partner or want reassurance, ask them. If you’re angry about something they did, tell them. If everything is going swimmingly well and you’re tempted to test, see a therapist to work out why you’re sabotaging a good relationship and perhaps struggling with intimacy issues.

"By . Tracey Cox . Ever wondered what your new lover is thinking the first time they see you stripped bare?My bet is any - and probably all - of the following: . What he's thinking: . Yahoo! I'm about to have sex! Tracey Cox reveals what goes through your partner's head (and your own) when you first strip off in front of one another . If a naked woman is standing in front of you it means sex is on the cards, so his first reaction is to feel mighty pleased. This is quickly taken over by a not so pleasant thought… . Is my penis big enough? Unlike women, all his bits are out there and on display immediately. Which is why he's frantically searching your face in an attempt to read any minute micro-expression that hints he's not living up to expectations. If he thinks he's passed this test, his next thought is another panicky one... Say I can't perform? Women can fake desire, men can't. The first time you have sex is unbearably exciting but the pressure is on…him. He's looking at your breasts: . After all that's been filtered and processed he can finally pay attention to what's in front of him. Time for the 'bra on vs bra off' test. You looked great in that cleavage-boosting Victoria Secrets push-up but do they stand up to scrutiny without the scaffolding? He's seeing what you've done down there: . This is a precarious moment because whether you've waxed, trimmed, kept a 'landing pad' or whipped the whole lot off, you can't please all the people all of the time. Some men love no hair because all is revealed, others look and instantly think of a plucked turkey. Tracey says that it is important for both of you to have body confidence in order to have great sex . He's watching to see how body confident you are: . If one arm flies up to hide your breasts and the other heads south to cover down below, he knows he's in for some pretty standard sex. Stand tall and let yourself be admired and he knows it's going to be fabulous. What he's not noticing: . Your weight. Unlike breasts, body size can't really be camouflaged. By the time you're both naked, he's already got a pretty good idea of what he'll see. Besides, he's far more interested in looking at the naughty bits to notice whether your thighs wobble when you walk. What she's thinking: . She's checking out your body generally: . Women are just as lookist as men are - studies tracking eye movement show women give men the once over physically just as much as men do women. It doesn't mean we'll dump you if you're not sporting a six-pack but don't kid yourself we're immune to what shape you're in. She's comparing to see who wins the body beautiful competition: . Tracey says that while everyone appreciates a good body, we are primarily attracted to faces . If you're in much better shape than we are, our body image issues are kicking in big time. Ohmigod I should never had had those crisps earlier. His legs are more shapely than mine are! Look at that bottom! How come men's bums don't droop like women's do? She's checking out how big you are: . But it's the opposite to what you think: if you're over size, this works against you! It's not true that women love men with big penises: it often makes sex uncomfortable, even painful. So if you're average size, feel reassured. Even if you're undersized, don't panic. So long as you're good with your tongue, it won't matter. She's looking to see if you have an erection: . If you haven't, the first thing we'll think is that it's our fault. Instantly reassure her it doesn't mean you don't fancy her now you've seen her starkers or you'll both end up deflated. She's watching your reaction to her nakedness: . This, quite frankly, is concerning us more than anything else. The correct response is your eyes lustfully travelling over our body and a 'You're good enough to eat' expression on your face. What is she not noticing? Not much! Women are better at taking in detail than men. We're more likely to notice that mole on your back, tan line, what brand underwear you just peeled off, your feet, your knees, how hairy you are...but don't panic because both sexes are far more forgiving than you think. While everyone appreciates a good looking body, people are more attracted to faces and ultimately fall for the person inside.

"By . Tracey Cox . Sex is an effort sometimes. There isn’t a long-term couple alive who hasn’t tossed up a romp in the bedroom versus a takeaway in front of the telly and gone for the latter. But if you’re thinking of permanently trading sex for snuggles, think again. Tracey says that couples who abstain from sex could be risking their mental and physical health . 'Oh, we stopped having sex long ago!', some couples cheerfully inform me. 'We’re passed all that now.' I understand why. The longer you’re with your partner, the less sex you have because of what’s called ‘habituation’: removal of the novelty factor. But there are very, very good reasons to fight this and keep getting physical with your partner.You might think it’s not that important but research shows if sex is non-existent, relationship dissatisfaction soars to 50 to 70 percent. And that’s not all that will go wrong for each of you…. You'll feel disconnected to your partner. You can remain physically connected by hugging, kissing and sleeping naked but for most people, sex is the most intimate act. For men, particularly, sex is a way of expressing love if they’re not great at articulating their emotions. Take sex off the table and you remove the most intense, effective, important way of showing affection. Love without sex is friendship. Tracey says that love without sex is inevitably just friendship . Sure, you’re each other’s best friends but is that really all you want to be? Friends? You'll be snappy and irritable. Don’t underestimate how sex acts as a buffer against the challenges you face in your relationship. If you’ve had great sex the night before, you’re far less likely to flip when you see the rubbish still sitting in the hall. You'll feel insecure. Knowing you’re desired and wanted by your partner, endorses your sense of self-worth. It makes you feel attractive, loved, special. Even if have both joked about the fact that you’re not having sex anymore, the closest couple are left with a nervous residue of uncertainty. Did they agree to abstinence because they really couldn’t care less about sex? Or because they want to please me? You'll increase the chances of an affair. Here’s the thing about sex: when you stop having it, you stop wanting it (which is how couples end up agreeing - openly or implied - to do without). But sex doesn’t go away. Sexual images are everywhere and sexy people are all around us. All it takes is a certain set of circumstances (all too often in the form of another person who’s attractive and does want to have sex with either us or our partner) and suddenly a desire for sex can come flooding back. What then? They know you aren’t interested or vice versa. What do you do with that resurgence of desire? No surprise that there’s a significant link between sexual dissatisfaction and infidelity. You'll lose your mind - literally. Sex is good for you, both physically and mentally. Sex makes us smarter: scientists found indulging regularly leads to better performance on learning and memory tests. It comes as no surprise that there's a significant link between sexual dissatisfaction and infidelity . You'll get more headaches and migraines. Orgasms release oxytocin and endorphins which can help relieve migraines, period pains and back pain. You'll die sooner. If you’re not already grabbing your partner and disappearing into the bedroom fast, this might do the job. Studies show the risk of death for middle-age men drops by 50 per cent for men who have orgasms at least twice a month. Sex twice a week also prevents heart disease in both sexes, reduces the risk of both breast and prostate cancer and boosts our immune system. Isn't it time you turned off the telly? Don’t want to end up in a sexless marriage? Tracey’s book Supersex for Life is a great sex guide for long-term partners.

"By . Tracey Cox . As yet another celebrity marriage seems to have bitten the dust with Blurred Lines Robin Thicke and wife Paula Patton announcing their split after twenty years, the question of how to recover from an affair seems more and more apt. While it's not clear what was the actual cause of the couple's parting, there have been many rumours of indescretions on Robin's part and few things compare with the pain of betrayal. When you love someone it feels like you’re in a nice, safe, love-infused bubble that no-one can penetrate. Tracey Cox reveals when you should forgive a cheating partner . Then, overnight, with a confession or a discovery, that bubble bursts. And boy does it burst with a bang. Some couples do survive infidelity but only if both of you honestly think the relationship is worth it and the guilty person is prepared to do everything it takes to win back your trust and love. This will help you decide and guide you through the process of recovery. STEP ONE: Are they worth another chance? Some cheating partners don’t deserve to be forgiven. Ask yourself these five crucial questions. Have they cheated on other people in the past? If someone has developed a pattern of cheating over and over, they will continue to do it again (and again) until someone – hopefully you – dumps them brutally and they realise they can’t get away with it. No second chances in this case. Ever. Why did they do it? A one-off incident with seemingly genuine reasons to explain it is a lot easier to forgive than repeated slip-ups or a long-term affair. When it comes to cheating a one-off incident is a lot easier to forgive than repeated slip-ups or a long-term affair . Put yourself in their shoes: if you were them, feeling the way they did, in the situation they were in, what would you do? Can you understand it? What do you think they will do if they're in the same predicament in the future? What guarantees can they give you that it won’t happen again? How was your relationship when it happened? You’ll be much more likely to forgive (if not forget) if you were aware your partner was unhappy, the relationship wasn’t great and you were suspicious. If you thought you were blissfully happy and didn’t notice a single sign that anything was wrong, it’s desperately hard to trust again. If there were no clues last time round, how will you know if it happens again? Do they regret what they’ve done? They should be even more miserable about the pain it’s caused than you are. STEP TWO: Give each other space . Your first reaction will be to want to cling onto him and not let him out of your sight. Don’t. There are two things you need to establish at this point: that you mean business and their behaviour is not acceptable and that you have dignity. If you live together, get him to move out for a few days. You need this time to logically sort through your emotions.If you don’t live together, say you don’t want to see them for a while. Start a diary of all your emotions and your questions and use it make a list of questions you need answers to at the end of the time apart. STEP THREE: Meet up . This isn’t a kiss and makeup session. This is a meeting to decide if there is enough worth saving. Warn your partner there are lots of questions you still need answered. If they're not prepared to answer them, forget it. If they are, start asking. This will be incredibly painful but it’s essential you get honest answers to what you need to know. Armed with answers, do you feel reasonably confident you’ll both pull through and there’s still enough to work with? Now’s the time to move back in or start seeing each other regularly again. Tracey says that if you didn't notice that anything was wrong, it can be desperately hard to trust again . STEP FOUR: Build a new relationship . Your old relationship, the damaged one, is dead. You now need to build a new one. Yes this is sad, but it’s also exciting. Just think! It may well end up even better than the first in lots of ways! What will be missing though, is innocence and trust. The aim is to replace this with other qualities, like, ‘We are survivors – even this didn’t break us up.’ You will feel insecure and you will feel angry. You will fight about it, over and over, to begin with. This is normal. To get through it, you need to set some rules for the new relationship. These are specific to you two but you might want to think about things like telling each other where you are all the time, checking in during periods that might be hard for you to cope with, sending lots of reassuring texts. Tracey says it is possible to move on and build a stronger relationship after cheating . STEP FIVE: Be prepared to change . All of the above looks after you, the wronged party. But as much as it should be skewed to look after you, it’s unfair to discount your partner’s needs.Your partner cheated for a reason. What did they get from this new person that they couldn’t get from you? Who were they with the new person? When couples have been together a long time, it’s hard to reinvent yourself and get your partner to see you as someone ‘new’. Were there parts of themselves that felt satisfied with the other person that aren’t being satisfied with you? What are they? Explore ways to help him be able to do this with you. One final question that I am asked all the time: when will I feel better and the pain go away? The answer is this: time heals wounds that are able to be healed. In six months, you should be feeling better most of the time; one year on, trust should be developing again. If it’s not, it’s time to move forward - solo.

"By . Tracey Cox . It’s yet another example of how our British reserve and prudishness about sex leads to unnecessary misery in the bedroom. A recent survey found although one in five women suffer from vaginal dryness - a common condition that makes sex uncomfortable, painful and sometimes impossible - 90 per cent of women suffer in silence. Even more ludicrous: a trip to the pharmacy for some simple gels and lubricants could solve the problem in an instant. Vaginal dryness can make sex painful or even impossible, and 18% say they have stopped having sex . Why don’t the majority of women get help or know this? Because, despite being a society saturated in sexual images, important, helpful sex information about conditions like vaginal dryness simply aren’t talked about. So please women of all ages, stick with me and let’s do it here and now! You don’t have to be ‘old’ to suffer from a dry vagina. Too much alcohol, not enough water, where you are in the menstrual cycle, stress, not feeling aroused enough, menopause - all can stop our vagina’s lubricating properly. Without lubrication, his penis isn’t able to penetrate easily and sex feels uncomfortable, painful and - if severe - becomes impossible. Not being ‘wet enough’ is the female equivalent of him not getting an erection: women feel embarrassed because they think he’ll think they’re not ‘turned on’ enough. If you’re single, you avoid starting relationships, thinking the guy will think you don’t fancy them. Married women avoid sex not just because it hurts but for fear their partner will feel rejected. The survey of 2000 adults, found one-fifth of women were depressed because of vaginal dryness, a quarter said they felt ‘less feminine’, nearly half felt ‘old’ because of it and one in 10 men said it had impacted on their sex life. A trip to the pharmacy for some simple gels and lubricants could solve the problem in an instant . Thirty-four percent of sufferers said it had driven a wedge between them and their partner - nearly a fifth don’t have sex at all because of it! Forty-two percent experience pain during intercourse because of it, one third have incessant itching and a further 31 per cent feel sore after sex. But in true British style, instead of talking with our partners and doctors about it - and discovering instant, inexpensive, no-hassle solutions - most women say nothing. We’d prefer to watch our sex lives disappear and threaten our marriages than speak up out of embarrassment. Ninety percent of the women surveyed wouldn’t even talk to their female friends about it. This is utter madness! Madness because all you need to solve it are two simple products. First, a moisturizing cream that replenishes the dehydrated vaginal skin which stops sex feeling painful and you feeling irritated and itchy. This survey was commissioned by Vagisan, who manufacture a moisturizing cream designed to solve the problem. Replens, Sylk, and various other brands also make one. The average cost is £11 and you can buy them at any pharmacy. The second product to buy is a good quality personal lubricant, also available from any pharmacy and online (my own supersex lovelube brand is perfect for this) for under a tenner. Use both and the problem will usually disappear within two weeks. It’s that easy - and most sex problems are that easy to sort as well. All it usually requires is a bit of honest communication, a visit to the doctor or a quick search on the internet for solutions and the problem is fixed. If only we could move past that British I-can’t-possibly-because-I’m-too-embarrassed attitude, we’d all be so much happier and healthier. Visit Tracey's MailOnline blog here .

"By . Tracey Cox . Are you one of the many women in the UK tempted to start an affair this week? The first week of January is when it's most likely to happen with lots of marriages stretched to the limit over the Christmas break. Used to be women had affairs if they fell out of love with their husbands and in love with someone else. The first week of January is when it's . most likely to happen with lots of marriages stretched to the limit over . the Christmas break . These days, a woman can be blissfully happy with her 2.5 children, in love with her husband and reasonably sexually satisfied - and still feel justified having more than a bit on the side . Then it became pseudo-acceptable (between friends and as much as affairs ever are accepted), to have If-only-I-hadn't-drunk-so-much-or-I'd-never-have-done-it one-night-slip-ups, if you weren't getting any at home. These days, a woman can be blissfully happy with her 2.5 children, in love with her husband and reasonably sexually satisfied - and still feel justified having more than a bit on the side. Illicitencounters.com - the UK's largest and longest running dating site for married people - has 750,000 members. A high proportion are women. Other sites like Adult Friend Finder and Shagaholic are also boasting soaring female memberships. Nine million Brits will look for love online this year - but around 1.4m women will instead search for sex on the side. Women are better at keeping secrets and covering their tracks, so less likely to be discovered . There's been a massive shift in women's attitudes towards affairs. Some of it is the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' effect: women feel they've been given permission to push boundaries and try things they wouldn't dare to before. If their husbands don't want to, they'll go elsewhere. The guilt most feel doing this is minimal: 'I deserve it.' 'It makes me feel alive.' 'I'm a great wife and mother, this is for me'. 'He'll never find out - who am I hurting?' 'Why give up something which gives me intense pleasure?' Women are better at having affairs, says Tracey Cox, pictured . Affairs are becoming less about filling an 'emptiness' in the marriage and more about sexploration. A case of wanting the cake and eating it too - with dessert wine, freshly brewed coffee, a cheeseboard with quince paste and oatcakes, hand-rolled Belgium chocolates, liqueur and (oh go on then) a post-dinner/coital fag as well. It's about having the basics (long-term security) as well as the trimmings (exciting bits). The lot - and then some. It's easy to look in and judge these relationships as outrageously selfish and 'bad'. But if they're not found out, the long-term partner in these circumstances often benefits as well. Their wife walks around whistling, full of the joy of life and if his libido is low, he appreciates not being nagged for sex (even if a little part of him wonders why). Even if the man has a high sex drive, it's rare they'll miss out on what was on offer before because having sex outside the marriage often sparks a higher desire for sex generally. Of course the whole thing topples - usually in a spectacular and devastatingly disastrous fashion - if the infidelity is found out. But here's the irony: turns out women aren't just playing men at their own game of cheating, they're better at it. Women are better at keeping secrets and covering their tracks, so less likely to be discovered. The old perception about affairs was that women didn't have as many as men because they're in control of themselves sexually and men aren't. The uncomfortable truth is, given half the chance, women cheat as much as men do. The difference now is we've got just as many opportunities as he had.

"By . Tracey Cox . Has having children ruined your sex life? Don't let it continue ruining it . Is the secret to a happy marriage not having kids? One of the biggest studies of relationships ever done in Britain has turned up this conclusion: couples without children have happier marriages. The Open University project called 'Enduring Love?' surveyed 5000 people to also find fathers were twice as likely as mothers to list 'lack of sex' as what they disliked most about their relationship. This isn't exactly startling news for parents or mothers - especially those with babies or young children and eyeballs hanging down their cheeks after their 250th sleepless night in row. But given you can't exactly flog off your five-month-old twins on ebay to save your marriage (and wouldn't want to - the survey found while kids might not enhance your love life, they send your personal happiness rating skyward) what exactly are parents to do as damage control? Happily, there's lots you can do to stay both sane and sexy - even better, most of it is relatively easy to implement! STAY SEXY . Don't stop cuddling even if you don't fancy sex. Hold hands, hug, swap air kisses for real ones. Have a bath together. Use a vibrator when you're too exhausted to have sex. Use it solo to keep your sex drive high (three minutes is possible to find when the baby's six months or older). Use it with him to guarantee you an orgasm during quickies. Just do it. Seriously, by the time you've dodged your partner's advances, lay there pretending to be asleep, worried that you've hurt them by saying no, you could have had a quickie and both be sleeping with a smile on your face. Just do it: By the time you've dodged your partner's advances, lay there pretending to be asleep, worried that you've hurt them by saying no, you could have had a quickie and both be sleeping with a smile on your face . It's fine to bargain in those early days: they get sex if they get up to do the early morning feed. It's totally acceptable to say 'You've got five minutes' when they want sex but you'd cut your right arm off for sleep. Grab any sex you can, don't be fussy. OK sex is better for your relationship than no sex. Don't worry if you don't 'finish' having sex. When was the last time you made a hot meal and managed to actually eat it while it was even slightly warm? Get used to it. It's how it is for a while. Count 'sexy' things as having had sex so it feels like you're doing it more: long snogs, sexy massages or baths. If you're really finding sex a pressure, agree to a sex detox. Take it off the table completely for an agreed amount of time (one month or two – no more). Up the affection and promise each other sex is only gone temporarily and it can give you the mental break needed to get through one of life's most stressful times. Count 'sexy' things as having had sex so it feels like you're doing it more: long snogs, sexy massages or baths . STAY SANE . Don't compete for the 'I'm worse off' award: It's hard for both so don't play martyr or try to score points. Instead work together as a team, help each other. Don't feel guilty about taking time out for sex and/or cuddles. The kids get your full attention all the rest of the time, you deserve private time too. Go out for dinner, no friends, no kids at least once every two months. Drink lots. Get so drunk, you can't help but have sex. Don't be the couple who only ever go out and have sex on birthdays and anniversaries. Take romantic breaks just the two of you: Leave the kids at home . Try to go to bed at the same time and sleep naked. Skin to skin contact is crucial for keeping the connection going. One weekend away every so often, minus kids, will rescue and rejuvenate more than you could ever imagine. If you can possibly, possibly swing it, do it. It's what every parent I spoke to said kept them remotely normal. Don't waste what spare time you have. Turn off the telly, stop texting, ban laptops. Ditch the bedroom TV: those who don't have one in there have sex an average of eight times a month, twice the average of those who do. Don't talk about the kids all the time. Remember what you used to talk about pre-kids? Stay current and curious about life. Don't replace your partner with your children. If you're not getting something you need, ask for it. Don't turn to the kids to provide it. Often they will and you'll be even further estranged. Get and use babysitters. Bribe parents, siblings, your neighbours, friends... Cultivate a tribe of people you trust to look after your children. Accept that things won't be perfect. You will be tired and irritable for a while. It doesn't mean you've fallen out of love, just that having children can be stressful. This too shall pass!

"By . Tracey Cox . Sex and relationship expert Tracey Cox says matter outside the bedroom can be just as important to a good sex life . A recent CNN health report showed 40 million Americans are stuck in a sex rut. Most therapists would agree the proportion of population similarly affected in the UK is equally as high. The reasons why we’re all so bored in bed are many: everything from unrealistic expectations to stressed lifestyles. Ask the average worn out parent what they’d most like to do in bed and most will answer ‘sleep’. There's no denying it: great sex is an achievement not a given. Couples who are still enjoying a great sex life after 10, 20 or even 50 years together, aren’t lucky - they’re committed to making sure it’s great, says Relate. I totally agree. Here’s what you can do to turn your sex slump into the start of something rather wonderful: . 1. Stop believing it’s ‘normal’ to not want sex long-term. Yes, desire does fall the longer you’ve been together but it’s a cop out to shrug your shoulders and say ‘Oh well, that’s just what happens’. There’s plenty you can do to stop this happening or reverse the effect. All you have to do is want to try. 2.Your relationship and sex life are connected. Most couples underestimate the affect their sex life has on their relationship and vice versa. Put some effort in the bedroom and your relationship will improve; make an effort out of bed and you’ll have more and better sex in it. 3. Act on impulses. At the start of the relationship, the desire for sex is strong and the feeling hard to miss. Later on, desire feels more like a flickering of flames than a raging fire. Be attuned to it and act on the ‘flicker’ as soon as possible. The longer you wait between first impulse and doing something, the less likely is it you’ll act on it. 4. Visit your GP to check your general health and review any medications which could be affecting your libido. Couples who are still enjoying a great sex life after 10, 20 or even 50 years together, aren't lucky - they're committed . 5. Keep a sex diary. Write down any erotic thoughts and what triggers them. Think back to what you both did in the beginning. Revisit the things you tried that you’ve forgotten you liked. Each come up with five things you miss and used to do together, put the suggestions in a jar and pull one out and action it every week. 6. Take a sex toy to bed together - preferably a good vibrator. Men are more motivated to have sex because it’s easier for them to orgasm. Most women find it easier to orgasm with a vibrator so it increases incentive to have sex if it's there as a 'standby' if all else fails. 7. Up the amount of sex you’re having, even if you don’t really fancy it to start with. When you’re all snuggled up watching telly, who can be bothered making the effort? But if you do, lots find desire kicks in once stimulation starts. Regular sex boosts the body’s production of testosterone which, in turn, makes you feel like sex next time around. 8. Talk about it. Make a pact to talk openly and honestly about your needs and wants and agree never to judge anything your partner suggests. 9. Use erotica: Watch sexy films, read sexy books, look at sexy images. Focusing on sex keeps your libido high. For more tips on how to increase your libido, visit traceycox.com.

"By . Tracey Cox . We learn lots of bad habits from celebrities (how to get tangoed, why one layer of lashes is never enough) but the absolute worst in my eyes is breaking the speed limit when it comes to relationships. Blink and you miss the courtship with people like Kerry Katona, Jordan and Tamara Eccelstone. They’ve met, married and practically had babies in the time most normal people have gone on a few dates. Celebrities such as Tamara Ecclestone (left) and Jordon, aka Katie Price, often meet, date and marry quickly . Kerry Katona and her, now ex, husband Mark Croft, who proposed to her after they had been dating only a few weeks . When we’re deep in the infatuation stage, all of us want to click our heels three times and whisk ourselves forward to the nice, safe, really committed bit. We’re all guilty of wanting to believe this new person will be by our side forever and the temptation is to race toward the finish line. My advice is don’t – for three good reasons. First: you’ll miss out on all the gorgeous niceties newness provides (you don’t quite know if they feel the same way about you and when they confess they do and you both smile stupidly at each other, life’s wonderful). Second: it’s ridiculous to commit for life when you’ve only known them for a second of yours. Third: if you push for intimacy before they’re ready, they may well run away. Sometimes it’s both of you speeding ahead. You meet at a party on Saturday night, stay up talking till dawn, end up sharing breakfast, then watch the Sunday night movie snuggled in each other’s arms. The only thing that stops the marathon date, is having to go to work on Monday morning. Tracey says that too much intimacy too fast can be a bad thing . It just has to be the start of something wonderful, right? Not necessarily. Therapists say long-lasting first dates send our expectations soaring ridicu­lously high – and few relation­ships live up to them. When the ‘magic’ wears off and real life creeps in, the affair fizzles out faster and leaves you feeling even more disillusioned than normal. Women are often the ones who push for intimacy too quickly, probably because we’re so comfortable with it. Some women go out with their victim (yep, victim) once, then call him three times the next day, drag him around to meet Mum three dates in, book next year’s Valentine’s Day dinner on the fourth date and then wonder why the guy ran away so fast he left burn marks on the hallway carpet. Here’s why: he figures if you’re this full-on in the beginning, you’ll strangle him with intimacy within a few months. An astute guy also realizes wanting to be instantly committed isn’t a compliment. Some women want a relationship and don’t really care who it’s with. You’ve also removed the mystery. He doesn’t have to lie in bed wondering if he’s really worthy of a girl like you because you’ve practically proposed already. There are many studies that show the longer the courtship, the more likely it is a couple who marry will stay together. In one study of couples who lived together before marriage, those who were now divorced had dated for around seven and a half months and lived together for 14 months before marrying. The couples who were still married had dated for 20 months then lived together for 16 months before marrying. So let’s all calm down, take a few deep breaths and think logically. If you’re planning on spending the rest of your life with this person, you’ve got the rest of your life to move in, get married and/or have babies.

"By . Andrew Levy . Neighbours in a small town are braced for a nasty surprise - after a python went missing and its owner warned it could be hiding in a coat sleeve. Charly Honey insisted Popeye was ‘only’ an 18in baby and posed no serious risk to the public. ‘I’ve got a puppy and a two-year-old stepdaughter and we’ve looked everywhere,’ said the 22-year-old, from Torpoint in Cornwall. Neighbours in Torpoint (pictured), Cornwall, have been warned a missing python may be hiding in a coat sleeve . ‘They turn up in the strangest of places, like the arm of a coat. But I can’t find her anywhere.’ Popeye – named because it has lost an eye – was safe in its tank last Tuesday when its owner gave it a mouse to eat. But when Miss Honey returned a little later, she found the mouse untouched and the snake missing. She said she would usually be confident of finding the three-year-old pet in the house, but the doors had been left open because of the hot weather. ‘The neighbours are not happy, and that’s understandable, but she’s of no risk to anyone,’ added Miss Honey. Ambush predators: Pythons are non-venomous but adults can eat animals the size of a cat (file picture) ‘She’s only small, she’s still a baby really. When she’s fully grown she’ll be around six foot long. ‘We’re starting to panic a bit. In the winter they go for the heat but it’s so warm she could have gone anywhere. I put another mouse in the tank in the hope that she would come back but she didn’t. ‘If she’s found I’d ask people not to touch her. If they’re brave they can put her in a pillow case.’ Miss Honey said Popeye had escaped once before, but it had happened when the python was being looked after by someone else during a house move. Pythons are native to Australia, Africa and Asia and are ambush predators – meaning they remain motionless and strike suddenly at passing prey. They are non-venomous but have sharp backward-curving teeth which are used to grab prey before killing them by constriction, leading to asphyxiation. Adults typically eat animals equivalent to the size of a domestic cat but some larger species have been known to devour adult deer. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘We would advise anyone who finds a stray captive snake to contact our cruelty and advice line.’","Popeye went missing from its tank in Torpoint, Cornwall, last Tuesday .

"By . Carol Driver . and Nick Pisa . A Ryanair plane has been left with £200,000 worth of damage to its rear stabiliser after it rolled backwards 40 metres crashing into an airport fire station. The force of the impact tore apart the 'tail wing' of the £72m Boeing 737 at Rome Ciampino Airport yesterday. The accident happened shortly after the aircraft, which has been grounded, landed and passengers had disembarked. This is the damaged caused to a  Ryanair plane after it rolled 40 metres into a fire station at Rome's Ciampino airport, causing more than £200,000 worth of damage . No one was on board the aircraft when the incident happened, according to a spokesman for Ryanair who said the aeroplane was parked but had not been properly secured. Witness . said the plane suddenly began to roll backwards and smashed into the . garage of the fire station at the airport causing external damage there . as well. One . witness told MailOnline Travel: 'It was surreal to watch. This big heavy jet just started . to roll backwards gathering speed until it crashed into the garage of . the airport fire station. 'The . whole thing only lasted a matter of seconds but the noise as it smashed . into the building was terrific. It was grinding metal and the damage . was quite severe. 'The guttering on the building was ripped off and wires and bits of metal were hanging off the plane. Damaged: The 737-800 plane was not properly secured on landing, and so began to roll backwards. Nobody was on board at the time, according to a Ryanair spokesman . 'It's a good job no one was standing by the garage or driving past as the plane would have slammed into them.' Usually . when a plane is parked stationary at an airport brakes are applied and . chocks positioned against the wheels to prevent it rolling backwards or . forwards. The . area where the incident happened is slightly uphill and close to the . main terminal which is used by millions of passengers, many of them . British, every year. Ryanair, which was recently voted the UK's worst airline, blamed the ground handling agent for the incident. Robin Kiely said: 'Ryanair has asked the ground handling agent . (Groundcare) to investigate why it failed to properly secure a Ryanair . aircraft at Rome Ciampino Airport yesterday. 'The parked and unoccupied aircraft rolled back and made contact with a remote building damaging its rear stabiliser. 'This is currently being replaced and the aircraft will shortly return to service.' Incident: Tourists leaving a Ryanair plane at Ciampino airport (file image) A spokesman for Ciampino airport said: 'We are investigating the cause of the incident and whether proper procedures were followed. 'We are aware of reports that chocks were not in place and that's why the police have also been involved and a criminal investigation is also under way. 'Until that is completed there is nothing else to say.' Groundcare, which was unavailable for comment, is currently on strike at the airport, forcing Ryanair to cancel flights. The damaged plane was out of service due to the strikes, which have seen Ryanair flights delayed today. Passengers at Rome's second airport are facing long lines and flight cancellations because of the wildcat strike by baggage handlers. The unannounced strike began Wednesday morning at Ciampino, a hub for Ryanair and other budget airlines. About 850 workers of Groundcare, one of seven private companies that handle unloading baggage and cargo at Rome airports, are striking to recover back pay. Groundcare recently filed for bankruptcy protection. Ciampino was paralysed by the dispute, and airport employees passed out water and hotel information to frustrated, stranded customers during the peak tourist season in Rome. Flights were cancelled into Wednesday evening. Italy's civil aviation authorities were meeting with Groundcare and the workers to try to resolve the dispute.","737-800 was parked at Rome Ciampino Airport when it started to roll .

"By . Tracey Cox . Half-term and holidays make for happy times - but also high levels of tension in relationships. Being together 24/7 with no respite from each other or the children isn’t easy - which is why I thought it timely to write about how to have love that lasts. These are the things that I think really count: . Don’t try to control each other. They aren’t you and you aren’t them so stop trying to turn them into you by controlling what they do or trying to influence how they think. Be tactful, be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you're desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument . Don’t take everything personally Your partner’s behaving like a right so-and-so? It could be they just got off the phone from their mother having a rant or they’re worried about work. You’re not the only person and thing influencing your partner’s moods. Talk about the happy times. Especially when you’re going through a rough patch. Remind yourselves of how good you are together when things are normal. Do lots together, no matter how mundane. Whether it’s the weekly shop, washing the dog, eating dinner on your laps in front of the telly, it all counts. Quality ‘’you two’ time is important but one ‘date’ a week isn’t going to beat spending time together frequently, no matter how routine it might be. Watch your language There’s a reason why this is mentioned in every relationship article. Say ‘I feel this way’ not ‘You made me feel this way’. Don’t make sweeping generalizations like ‘You never do this or that’ or “You’re always late’. Tracey Cox says half-term and holidays make for high levels of tension in relationships . Touch each other constantly. Both sexually and affectionately – and make sure you know the difference. Know each other’s ‘raw’ spots. Be sensitive to vulnerabilities, rather than use them to score points. If your partner’s down, be extra nice and they’ll return the favour when you’re not feeling so chipper. Don’t always assume the worst. He didn’t make the effort to come and see your Mum in hospital? Instead of assuming they did it deliberately ask why. Perhaps they didn’t realise how important it was to you. Spell out your needs very clearly and don’t expect your partner to mind-read. Honesty isn’t the best policy. To be 100% honest, you would have to express every fleeting sexual thought you have about others and every negative thing you think about your partner. Neither are wise. Be tactful, be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you’re desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument. Don’t try to change the other person. Don’t play the ‘if only’ game. If only they were kinder, richer, happier, had more hair. We can’t change other people. All we can change is our reaction to them. Put yourself in their shoes. Before you react defensively, see it from their point of view. Then speak. Don’t do all the work in the relationship. If you’re always the one who steps in to solve things, you don’t give your partner the chance to try. You feel resentful for doing all the fixing, they feel controlled. Treat your partner the way you treat your friends. We wouldn’t dream of speaking to friends the way we do our partners. Have some manners. Silence is deadly. Fine to shut up until you’ve calmed down but not speaking for days on end is incredibly damaging. The longer you don’t get on, the bigger the argument becomes. Make your own rules. You’re unique, so is your partner and so is your relationship. People like me can rattle on all they want but only you two know what works for you.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Officials from the U.S. Coast Guard and the British Royal Fleet announced Tuesday that the two nautical organizations had collaborated on an enormous cocaine bust in the Caribbean Sea that both agencies describe as historic. In all, officers unloaded more than 2,500 pounds of cocaine off of the Sitkinak cutter Tuesday morning that was discovered on a boat just off the coast of the Dominican Republic in the early morning hours of January 22. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The haul: Officials say they discovered more than 2,500 pounds of cocaine on a boat in the Caribbean Sea last week . Smugglers: Officials say they say a speed boat with packages on its deck on January 22 just south of the Dominican Republic . Ditched: The smugglers started throwing bricks of cocaine into the ocean once they realize they'd been spotted . Authorities say the cocaine recovered has a street value of more than $37 million. Officials say officers aboard the 110-foot island class Sitkinak spotted a 25-foot go-fast boat with two outboard engines racing along the Dominican Republic's southern coast. According to  U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Gabe Somma, there were 'very visible packages on the deck.' Seized: Wave Knight then launched its own small boat with a US Coast Guard team to board and question the suspects . Value: The 1.25 tonnes of the Class A drug had a UK wholesale value of more than £60 million, but the street value would have topped £300million . Weight: Authorities found about 45 prepackaged bricks of cocaine floating in the sea in the wake of the smugglers' boat . Pricey: Authorities estimate that the 2,500 pounds of cocaine is worth more than $37 million . Coast Guard officials then notified the British ship Wave Knight - which also was in the area - about the suspected smugglers. The smugglers - knowing they'd been discovered - began dumping the 45 prepackaged bricks of cocaine into the ocean. However, a Coast Guard helicopter already had been deployed from the deck of the Wave Knight and the drugs were recovered. Cooperation: Authorities say the bust is the first time a U.S. helicopter has been launched from a British ship . Haul: More than a tonne of cocaine worth more than £60million from a speedboat in the Caribbean in an operation involving the Royal Navy . According to the Miami Herald, four men were taken into custody. They later were handed over to federal law enforcement officials. The U.S. and British fleets have been participating in joint operations in the Caribbean for several years, but the January 22 bust was the first time a U.S. ship was launched from a British ship.","U.S. officials spotted the smuggler's speedboat south of the Dominican Republic .

"By . Nick Pisa . A British couple who survived the Costa Concordia sinking are seeking more than £1million in damages. John and Mandy Rodford were among the last passengers to be plucked to safety from the stricken Costa Concordia, which struck rocks hours after leaving port for a seven-day Mediterranean cruise. Both attended the trial today of the luxury liner's captain Francesco Schettino, who is accused of multiple manslaughter and causing the disaster which cost the lives of 32 people - with one body still to be found. Traumatised: John and Mandy Rodford, pictured returning to the UK after the disaster in 2012, revealed to the trial of the Costa Concordia's captain that they are seeking a million Euros each in damages . Mr Rodford, 48, told the hearing at Grosseto: 'We have asked for a million Euro each in damages. 'Costa Cruises [the ship's owner] did not give us any emergency instructions when we left - instead something was planned for the following day. ''It is difficult to accept that the company is still operating and we are having trouble sleeping more than two years after the tragic events of that night.' Mandy, 46, told the hearing: 'Costa Cruises needs to suffer as we have - we almost lost our lives.' They described how they were initially told 'everything was under control' but then scenes of panic developed as the ship began to list, leaving objects to slide off tables and crash to the floor. Because of the angle at which the ship was leaning, lifeboats could not be launched and they had to clamber back out of the first one they boarded because it would not deploy. Stricken: Costa Cruises, which owned the ship, has already offered 17,000 Euros in compensation to each of the passengers and crew on board when the ship hit rocks in 2012 off the Italian island of Giglio (pictured) The couple, from Rochester, Kent, were on the Costa Concordia to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary when disaster struck in January 2012 and were among 35 Britons on the ship. Costa Cruises has already offered compensation of 17,000 Euros to each of the 4,000 passengers and crew who were onboard the Costa Concordia that night. But many have slammed the offer as 'ridiculous' and are taking out individual compensation cases against Costa Cruises, which could end up costing the firm millions of pounds if they lose. The trial has already heard how Schettino - dubbed Captain Coward for abandoning ship while passengers were still on board - is said to have deliberately steered his ship close to the island to show off, recklessly endangering lives. Another survivor, Italian Tommaso Napoli, told the court that after the ship struck rocks he 'feared I would never see my wife and children again'. On trial: Captain Francesco Schettino is accused of multiple manslaughter and showing off by sailing too close to the island - but he insists he was given out-of-date nautical charts. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted . He added that as he tried to reach a lifeboat he was 'bowled over by sea of people convinced they were about to die.' Other witnesses told the hearing of the scenes of chaos on board the liner with confused crew ordering passengers to return to their cabins as there was a 'temporary blackout'. Ohers were ordered to muster points in restaurants after the Concordia struck rocks off the island of Giglio. Schettino denies the charges against him, and has insisted that he instead saved lives. His case is that the ship struck rocks because he had been given out-of-date charts. Prosecutors want him jailed for twenty years and the trial is not expected to end until 2016 at the earliest, with hundreds of people due to testify.","John and Mandy Rodford from Rochester, Kent, were on dream Italian cruise .

"By . Nick Pisa . Mafia mobsters are suspected of being behind a massive cannabis farm found growing inside an abandoned 500-year-old Italian convent. More than 100 plants were discovered in a raid by carabinieri paramilitary officers in the crypt of the building which is decorated with ornate frescoes. Officials said they also discovered a sophisticated irrigation system as well as a lighting which had been illegally connected to a mains electric supply. The discovery was made in the St Agata alla Guilla convent in the notorious Capo quarter of the city of Palermo on the island of Sicily, the spiritual home of the Mafia. 'Pungent': Carabinieri paramilitary officers inspect more than 100 cannabis plants found inside the crypt of a 16th Century convent on the island of Sicily that police believe were being grown by the mafia . Police said the plants were fully grown and when 'harvested' would have made more than €500,000 (£420,000) on the streets of the city and elsewhere across Sicily. To access the indoor farm, police had to make their way through the building to an iron door which led to a further entrance down to the crypt where the cannabis plants were being grown. Officers also discovered more than 100 empty black plastic plant pots which they suspected were being readied to transplant saplings from the plants so the cultivation would be multiplied several times over. A police source who was involved in the raid said the air was 'thick with the pungent smell of the cannabis plants' and the atmosphere was 'hot and humid' due to the powerful lights that had been rigged up. The 16th Century convent was abandoned more than 25 years ago and is dedicated to St Agatha, who is said to have lived in Palermo and is the patron saint of Sicily. Vast: Police said the plants, when harvested, would have a street value of more than ¿500,000 (£420,000) Stashed: The discovery was made in the St Agata alla Guilla convent (above) in the notorious Capo quarter of the city of Palermo on the island of Sicily, the spiritual home of the Mafia . Much of the original ornate decorative plasterwork is still visible over the doors and archways and the walls also have faded murals on them depicting religious scenes. For years, the convent was a retreat for prostitutes who wanted to give up working the streets and only four years ago Palermo city council put forward plans for a £700,000 restoration project for the building but the plans were not approved. A Palermo police spokesman: 'The plants will be taken away, examined and then destroyed. 'Then the investigation will start into who was behind the farm which was extensive and which would have produced a large amount of drugs with a street value of six figures. 'There were more than 100 plants in the farm which were 150cm high and we also discovered several pots in an adjoining room which we believe were being prepared for further plants, as there were also dozens of bags of soil in the building. 'An irrigation system had been installed and the lighting camp from several lamps which had been rigged up illegally to the mains supply. 'It was an extensive operation and our belief is that it is connected to organised crime and a local Mafia family.'","More than 100 plants discovered in crypt of building on island of Sicily .

"By . Nick Pisa . British jails may have banned books for inmates but in Italy, the more prisoners read the more time have knocked off their sentence. New legislation set to be passed means that for every book a prisoner gets through, three days will be knocked off their sentence - up to a maximum of 48 days in a year. Officials say that is the equivalent of 16 books and they all have to be above 400 pages and approved by prison staff - comic books and picture books are excluded. Turning over a new leaf: British jails may have banned books for inmates but in Italy, the more prisoners read the more time have knocked off their sentence (file picture) The initiative will be introduced for jails in the southern Italian region of Calabria - home to the local mafia known as the Camorra. Mario Caligiuri, a cultural chief on the regional council and who proposed the idea, said: 'Reading is an exceptional antidote to disquiet and it favours understanding. as well as social and personal reawakening. 'With this new regional law, inmates under proper guidance and supervision, will be invited to read a book and earn time off their sentence. 'The policy is open to all inmates serving six months or more and they can read up to 16 books a year which will give them a maximum of 48 days off their sentence. Reduction: New legislation set to be passed means that for every book a prisoner gets through, three days will be knocked off their sentence . 'At the moment it is only being implemented in Calabrian prisons but we hope that the government will recognise this initiative and see how well it works and introduce it nationally. 'The idea is to allow crowded prisons some breathing space. We are confident of promising results. The books permitted will be carefully chosen and comic books or ones with a lot of pictures will be excluded.' Italian prisons are some of the most overcrowded in Europe with the population topping 80,000, with space only for 60,000 and as a result several policies have been introduced to reduce numbers. Earlier this year fugitive mobster Domenico Rancadore, who was arrested in Uxbridge, successfully fought an extradition request from Italy saying the conditions in jails breached his human rights. Last November British prisons introduced a books ban which restricted the items that could be sent to inmates and the Ministry of Justice has received several complaints. The Incentives and Earned Privileges scheme was introduced in England and Wales partly as an attempt to crack down on drugs getting into prisons. Prisoners have since argued that books sent to them in parcels are key to their rehabilitation. A test case is being brought against the MOJ by a female prisoner unhappy with the ban and poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy, is among a string of writers who have argued against the ban claiming it hurt the 'soul of the country'. But Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has defended the policy through an open letter to her, insisting it kept prisons free of drugs. The government has also maintained that prisoners can still use prison libraries or earn money to buy books.","Inmates can earn a maximum of 48 days off a year for reading books .
But they have to be more than 400 pages and comic books don't count .
Comes after UK banned friends and relatives sending books to prisoners ."
"By . Nick Pisa . Imposter: Drunken rugby fan Joshua Goldsworthy almost managed to convince Italian police he was a member of the England team . A drunk rugby fan was given a police escort to the luxury Rome hotel where the England team is based for this weekend's Six Nations match against Italy, after convincing them he was a member of the squad. Joshua Goldsworthy, 20, was arrested for . being drunk and disorderly in Rome city centre and then began . resisting attempts to get into a police vehicle. Officers became alarmed after he told them he . was a key player with Stuart Lancaster's England fifteen and decided to . rush him back to the squad's luxury five star hotel. But when they arrived with the man and asked to speak to an official from the RFU to verify his identity they were told:'Sorry, we've never seen this man before.' Goldsworthy was taken to a city centre police station where he was being held for assaulting an officer, resisting arrest and being drunk and disorderly. Passers by had raised the alarm after the man began throwing empty beer bottles and glasses at pedestrians and passing traffic. When police arrived the man, who is thought to have become separated from his friends during a night out, threw a bottle at them before running away but was quickly caught. A police spokesman said: 'He was in a very drunk state and very abusive towards the officers while he was being taken in the car to the police station. 'When the man then said he was a member of the England squad they became concerned and so decided to double check. 'They went to the hotel where the England . team are staying and asked the officials but they said they had never . heard of him at all - so he was taken back to the main police station in . the city where he is now being held.' Not impressed: An England official told Italian police: 'We've never seen this man before' Incredibly after the incident Goldsworthy posted a message on his Twitter account to say he was going out drinking in Rome again . Around 20,000 fans made the trip to Rome for the crunch game which was played at the city's Olympic Stadium. Goldsworthy, . has a Twitter account account in the name of @rubberbooby, with a . photograph of himself dressed as a Tellytubby character and he describes . himself as a 'professional Guinness drinker'. Last Thursday he posted about the trip saying: 'See you all later on off to Italy for a cheeky weekend away'. Blag: Cornishman Goldsworthy told Italian police that he was a member of England coach Stuart Lancaster's Six Nations team . It appears Goldsworthy was released before the kick off and managed to get in and watch the game as he posted a tweet saying what a good game it had been. But he made no mention of his arrest and even bragged how he was going out drinking in the city again. After England won the match by 11 point to 52 a post appeared on his Twitter account reading: 'Cracking game great win now a few beers in Rome!'

"By . Nick Pisa . and Lucy Crossley . A second racing driver who starred in the hit Formula 1 film Rush has been killed in a car accident. Mauro Pane, 50, who acted as a stunt double for actor Daniel Bruhl in the movie, was found dead in his car after it spun off the road and plunged into a canal. Police found the body of an unidentified woman in the car alongside Mr Pane when it was discovered in the stretch of water near Gambolo in northern Italy. Scroll down for video . Killed: Mauro Pane, 50, has become the second racing driver who starred in the hit Formula 1 film Rush to be killed in a car accident . Driver: Mr Pane (right) with Rush director Ron Howard during filming of the 2013 movie . Italian Mr Pane shot several of the racing scenes in Rush, doubling for Mr Bruhl who played Austrian driver Niki Lauda. The 2013 film told the story of the rivalry between Lauda and flamboyant British driver James Hunt, played by Thor star Chris Hemsworth. Mr Pane's death comes just four months after Sean Edwards, a British driver who lived in Australia, died after a Porsche he was in burst into flames after hitting a wall in Brisbane. Scene: Mr Pane stood in for actor Daniel Bruhl, who played Niki Lauda, in some film scenes . Mr Edwards played his father Guy, who famously pulled Lauda from the wreckage of his burning Ferrari following the Austrian's near-fatal crash at the Nurburgring in 1976. Police in Pavia near Milan, said Mr Pane had been missing since Sunday and his white Renault Megane car was found late on Thursday in countryside near Gambolo, about 15 miles away from his home in Sannazzaro. He was last seen by his father after a family lunch, and he had said he was going to work at his garage for the rest of the day. However, when he failed to answer his phone the alarm was raised and a search began. Friends of Mr Pane said that he had been depressed since the death of his wife last year but had now started to 'get back to his old self' and was enjoying being back at his historic racing car business. In 2008 he had won the Historic Formula One Championship, driving a six-wheeled Tyrrell P34. Starring role: Mr Pane appeared in the hit film Rush, doubling for Daniel Bruhl (pictured right alongside co-star Chris Hemsworth) Rivals: James Hunt (left) and Niki Lauda (right) before the start of the Japan Grand Prix in October 1976. Their rivalry is featured in the 2013 film Rush . 'The car was spotted in the canal and when pulled from the water two bodies were found inside,' said a police spokesman. 'One is that of Mauro Pane and the second is that of a woman who has not yet been formally identified. 'It looks like the car came off the road and went into the canal but the full cause is still being investigated and it is too early to say for sure. 'We will have to carry out toxicology tests on the two victims as well to see if there were any contributing factors.' In a statement Classic Grand Prix which supply historic racing cars for films and events, said: 'We are devastated to have to announce the tragic death of one of our own, Mauro Pane. Racer, engineer, champion and a fantastic friend. RIP.' Some Italian media reports have speculated that the woman Mr Pane, who previously worked as a test driver for F1 team Minadi and was a 1986 Italian go kart champion, was with was a prostitute, however police were unable to confirm this. Double tragedy: Mr Pane's death comes just four months after Sean Edwards (pictured), a British driver who lived in Australia, died after a Porsche he was in burst into flames after hitting a wall in Brisbane . Family ties: Mr Edwards played his father Guy, who famously pulled Lauda from the wreckage of his burning Ferrari following the Austrian's crash at the Nurburgring in 1976 . In October last year, Mr Edwards died in a crash on the final corner while giving a lesson on a track. The 26-year-old's mother Daphne McKinley said after his death that she believed the car careered off the track because the throttle became jammed. Mr Edwards was a passenger in a Porsche when it hit a wall at Queensland Raceway in Willowbank, west of Brisbane. Rush, which was written by Peter Morgan . and directed by Ron Howard, has been nominated for four awards at this . weekend's BAFTA film awards ceremony, including Best Supporting Actor . for Mr Bruhl and Best British Film.","Italian driver Mauro Pane, 50, was a stunt double for actor Daniel Bruhl .

"By . Nick Pisa . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and midfielder Frank Lampard have been unwittingly drawn into a mafia murder trial. Pictures of the Special One and Lampard have been used as evidence by lawyers representing alleged mob godfathers Carmine Pagano, Carmine Amato and Rito Calzone. They claim they could not have been involved in the murder of rival Carmine Amoruso, 44, gunned down in a video arcade as part of a war between rival factions eight years ago because they were at a football match. Vital: Pictures of Lampard have been used as evidence by lawyers representing alleged mob godfathers Carmine Pagano, Carmine Amato and Rito Calzone (left) The pictures show the three accused, posing with Mourinho and Lampard while the Blues were staying at the luxury Hotel Arts in Barcelona where the team were staying for a Champions League clash. Others photos show the men alongside then Chelsea stars Hernon Crespo and Nuno Morais - the game ended in a 1-1 draw with Barcelona going through 3-2 on aggregate after beating the Premier League side in London. A supergrass named the three men as responsible for the murder and they have already been convicted and sentenced to life but are currently appealing. Lawyers at the hearing in Naples have also produced plane tickets and hotel bills as proof for the trio's alibis and staff from the hotel are also expected to testify. The three men are members of the Amato-Pagano crime family who have been waging a murderous war against rivals for control of lucrative drug markets in Naples, home to the local mafia known as the Camorra. One picture shows Calzone, 40, standing next to a smiling Lampard in the corridor of the plush five star hotel Arts where rooms start at £1,000 a night. Evidence: (Left to right) Rito Calzone, 'Jose Mourinho', Carmine Pagano, and Carmine Amato . Calzone was sentenced to 14 years by a court in Naples in 2010 and the bloody war between the rival gangs has claimed more than 50 lives. He is also suspected of seven murders and is a committed member of the hard core Napoli Ultras and has been photographed several times at their stadium and police say he was involved in serious fighting with supporters of rivals Roma in 2008. Amoruso was shot several times in the hit and died in an ambulance as he was being rushed to hospital, while another man he was with, a convicted mobster, suffered serious leg injuries but survived. The supergrasses have been named as Antonio Parolisi and Andrea Pica and both claim Calzone was at the scene of the murder in a suburb of Naples and had ordered it along with the two other men later saying 'a just thing has been done.' Police say the trio have made millions from importing cocaine and supplying the city of Naples as well as much of southern Italy and it funded their luxury lifestyle of lavish villas and top of the range cars. Case: Others photos show the men alongside then Chelsea stars Hernan Crespo (centre) and Nuno Morais (third left) - the game ended in a 1-1 draw with Barcelona going through 3-2 on aggregate . Official say they flew business class to Barcelona on false identity documents and spent more than £15,000 during their three night stay at the hotel Arts. Luigi Senese, the lawyer defending Cesare Pagano, said:""These photographs are crucial to the case because thy indicate that my client and the other two men could not have been at the scene of the murder. 'You can clearly see Pagano in the pictures with the Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho as well as several team members. How can he and the others have been at the murder and at the game at the same time? 'These super grasses are lying. The three men were in Barcelona for a Champions League match and besides the photographs we have hotel receipts and airline tickets. 'The three men were in Barcelona to watch the match as they are all keen football fans no fortunately for them they bumped into Mourinho and took a photograph with him to prove they were there.'

"By . Suzannah Hills . and Nick Pisa . Amanda Knox is at home in America awaiting the verdict of the latest Meredith Kercher murder trial while her co-accused Raffaele Sollecito attended the final hearing in Florence today. Knox, who yesterday unveiled a dramatic new short haircut in Seattle, is being retried in her absence for the brutal killing of her former roommate in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. Italian judges at the appeal court have now retired to consider the evidence and are expected to announce their verdict later today. Knox, who was pictured with her new short bob leaving the downtown branch of Gene Juarez salons on Wednesday, has admitted her 'heart will be in her mouth' today as she awaits the latest verdict. Scroll down for video . Awaiting the verdict: Amanda Knox, pictured today in Seattle, is with her family in America while Italian judges deliberate in Florence on the latest Meredith Kercher murder trial . In court: Raffaele Sollecito arrives at court in Florence, Italy, for the final hearing ahead of the verdict in the latest Meredith Kercher murder trial . She told Italian television via Skype . that she would be at home in Seattle with her mother and family and . that her lawyer would inform her of the outcome. Insisting . she was not involved in the murder, she said: 'The proof is in the . facts. There is no proof that I was there when this happened. I remember . Meredith as a person who gave me friendship from the very beginning. 'If I am convicted I understand that I will be seen as a fugitive but I will continue to fight until the end.' While Sollecito arrived at court today for the final hearing ahead of the verdicts, Knox has already said she will not return to Italy, where there is no statute of limitations for murder, if she is found guilty. The court hearing today began with the last round of rebuttals by Knox's defence team closing four months of arguments in the third trial for the brutal 2007 murder. Knox's lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told the court he is 'serene' about the verdict because he believes the only conclusion from the case files is 'the innocence of Amanda Knox'. Co-defendants: Raffaele Sollecito is on trial for Meredith's murder alongside his former girlfriend Knox . Raffaele Sollecito faces being jailed for a second time if found guilty of the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher . A Florence appeals panel, designated by Italy's supreme court to rule on the case, deliberated on the case . Support: Raffaele Sollecito is flanked by his stepmother Mara Papagni, left, and his aunt Sara Achille, right, as he leaves court after attending the final hearing before the third verdict for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher . Patrick Lumumba, the barman Knox wrongly accuse of Meredith's murder, speaks to the media outside the Nuovo Palazzo di Giustizia courthouse in Florence where the verdicts are expected later today . It comes after six years of trials and investigations have so far failed to clear up mysteries surrounding the murder of Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed to death in her bedroom in the picturesque town of Perugia, where she shared a student flat with Knox. Knox, 26, and Sollecito, 29, were convicted of the murder in 2009 and spent almost four years in jail, but the verdicts were overturned on appeal and Knox immediately returned home to the United States upon her release in 2011, where she has remained. However, last year, Italy's highest court quashed the appeal ruling due to what it called 'contradictions and inconsistencies' and ordered a retrial. The case has played out through the . media as much as through the courts, propelling Knox and Sollecito to . something approaching celebrity status in their home countries. Armies . of bloggers battle over disputed evidence about the case online. New look: Amanda Knox unveiled a dramatic new . haircut in Seattle yesterday ahead of judges delivering their verdict in . the Meredith Kercher murder trial today . Changes: Knox has been trying to keep a low-profile in Seattle where she has returned to her studies at the University of Washington . Knox, pictured yesterday covering up her short hair in a hat, has already said she will not return to Italy whatever the outcome of the retrial . Supporters . of Knox in the United States have done much to transform an initial . public image of her as a sex-obsessed party girl, which critics say . prevented a fair trial, to one portraying her as a victim of a faulty . justice system. The . Kercher family has repeatedly called for the full truth to come out . about the case, and the victim's brother Lyle and sister Stephanie are . expected to be in court today to hear the verdict. Knox . has pleaded her innocence in an email to the court. Sollecito arrived at court for the final hearing today ahead of the verdict later today which could . lead to his immediate detention or house arrest. The . prosecution has asked for Sollecito and Knox to be jailed for 26 years . for the murder and for staging a robbery to cover it up. It . has also asked for a separate sentence of four years for Knox for a . standing slander conviction, for falsely implicating Congolese bar owner . Patrick Lumumba in statements to police in which she described hearing . her roommate scream. 'Face of an angel': Amanda Knox pictured left in 2008 when she first went on trial for the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher, pictured right . Suspects: Amanda Knox pictured with Raffaele Sollecito shortly after Meredith Kercher's murder . The prosecution says this points to her guilt, but Knox has said she was confused and spoke under duress. Lawyers . for Sollecito and Knox argue that only one person is guilty of the . murder: Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, who is serving a 16-year sentence . for sexually assaulting and stabbing Kercher. His trial found that he . did not act alone because of the number and variety of Kercher's more . than 40 wounds. The . initial case argued that Knox and Sollecito had killed Kercher in a sex . game gone awry, but the prosecution has moved away from this . interpretation in the current appeal. The retrial has focused on a re-examination of DNA evidence. In . closing defence arguments, Sollecito's lawyer argued that a trace of . his client's DNA on a metal hook on Kercher's bra clasp was there due to . contamination, because it was not collected from the crime scene until . more than a month after the murder and was repeatedly touched. Tears: An emotional Knox, pictured in 2011, after her guilty verdict was overturned following an appeal . Return: Knox, pictured on the Today Show in September, has denied she had anything to do with the 2007 murder . The . defence and prosecution contest whether Kercher's DNA was on the blade . of a kitchen knife from Sollecito's apartment, which had been used by . Knox. Whatever the . verdict, one side is likely to challenge it, and it will have to be . confirmed by Italy's high court to become definitive. Italy could ask for Knox to be extradited to serve any sentence, but her legal team is likely to challenge this. Additionally, . Knox has appealed her slander conviction to the European Court of Human . Rights, one of a plethora of spin-off cases from the trial, and could . do the same if convicted again of the murder.","Knox, 26, was photographed leaving a hair salon in Seattle on Wednesday .

"By . Nick Pisa . You wouldn't think hitmen could miss from almost point-blank range, but two would-be assassins on a motorbike made a complete hash of it. Their intended victims cheated death despite the gunmen unleashing a hail of bullets after their guns jammed in a terrifying ambush in the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Shock footage of the attack was released by Italian police on its . Facebook site after an investigation of almost two years eventually led . to the arrest of the alleged shooters. Scroll down for video . Ambush: The pillion passenger draws a pistol to shoot one of the Italian businessmen just leaving a shop in Reggio Calabria . Escape: The intended victim distracts the would-be assassin by attempting to push away the gun . Shooting: The motorbike rider fires at one of the targets as he falls over then runs off down the street . Hail of bullets: One of the gunmen fires into the shop where the other businessman has fled for safety . The suspects, named as Antonino Pricoco, 40 and Giole Mangiola, 29, were held despite a 'wall of silence' from the victims - businessmen Filippo Nocera and Francesco Barreca. They both refused to cooperate with detectives and reveal any details of a possible motive which is believed to be a feud over an unpaid 3,000 euro debt. Footage from CCTV installed on a next door building, shows the two hitmen approaching on a powerful motorbike, wearing helmets to conceal their identity. As they pull up outside a shop, the pillion passenger can be seen drawing a pistol. One of the businessmen tries to initially knock away the gun while the . other target dives back inside the shop for safety. Moment of terror: The motorbike roars along the pavement towards the intended victims who is casually walking back to the shop . Lucky: The pillion passenger aims at the businessman but misses and his gun jams . Running off: Shots are fired at one of the intended victims who escapes by hiding by a car then fleeing the scene . Both hitmen then . start firing wildly into the building and down the road as one target falls over then . runs off. A passing car is seen stopping, then . reversing away from the scene at high speed, while innocent passers by dived for cover. The incident lasted no more than 20 . seconds before both hitmen roared off into the night leaving their . intended victims shaken but unhurt after it emerged that both guns had . eventually jammed. The city is the heartland of the local mafia known as the 'ndrangheta. which is said by police to be one of the . most lucrative and powerful organised crime networks in the world, . making billions of pounds a year from drug trafficking, gun running and . extortion . Police said the two men were tracked down after 'high tech investigations' involving intercepted telephone calls and bugging devices, during an exhaustive two-year inquiry following the attempted double murder in March 2012. Suspects: Antonino Pricoco, 40, left and Giole Mangiola, 29, were arrested after a two-year investigation . Police said the feud had begun after Nocera's brother, Giuseppe, had allegedly failed to pay both gunmen the 3,000 Euro outstanding balance for a motorbike. An argument had led to a fight between them which 24 hours later evolved into an alleged attempted double murder. Pricoco and Mangiola, who were arrested in dawn raids on their homes, are now in custody facing charges of attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm. A police spokesman said: 'This was a difficult investigation because of the wall of silence that we had from the intended targets and their associates. 'The arrests were only made after the result of a long and complicated investigation involving telephone intercepts and the motive was finally uncovered which led us to both men. 'The footage of the incident is shocking - it resembles something from a Playstation game - and both men were lucky to escape with their lives as the weapons both jammed at the time of the shooting.'","Intended victims saved by jammed guns as they fled from would-be assassins .

"By . Nick Pisa . and Daily Mail Reporter . Amanda Knox has clarified statements she made to an Italian newspaper yesterday when she said that if she is re-convicted for the murder of her former roommate in an ongoing retrial then she will go on the lam. Today she put out a statement through her lawyers saying that if she is found guilty, 'legally I'll be defined as a ""fugitive,"" but I will continue to fight for my innocence.' 'I will not willingly submit myself to injustice.' This comes after she told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: 'If I am convicted then I will be, as they say, on the run.’ Rewording her thoughts: Amanda Knox has clarified an earlier statement where she said she would go on the run if she is convicted of her roommate's murder . Knox, 26, has stayed in Seattle while there is an Italian retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Her ex boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito has been present for the trial and while they have not seen each other since they were released from prison, they have been in touch. ’I have spoken to Raffaele... he is more optimistic than me,' she told La Repubblica. Knox and Sollecito are accused of stabbing Ms Kercher to death and sexually assaulting her while the young women were studying abroad in Perugia in 2007. Knox has not appeared and explained . herself saying: ’It was a really painful decision not to attend the . retrial. I wanted to come. I wanted to be present in court. ‘I was put in jail for four years with no proof, but on suppositions.’ This latest interview is not the first time that Knox made it clear that she has no intentions of returning to prison for the murder. First time around: Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were the immediate suspects in Meredith Kercher's murder and their behavior in the days following the discovery of her dead body surprised many . Raffaele Sollecito stands in the courtroom ahead of the hearing in the retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher, in Florence, Italy . 'I was already imprisoned as an innocent person in Italy and I can't reconcile the choice to go back with that experience,' she told The Today Show's Matt Lauer during a September 2013 interview following the release of her book. Victim: Knox's roommate during their time abroad, Meredith Kercher, was sexually assaulted and murdered in 2007 . One other wish of hers that has not yet come true is the hope that she can meet with Meredith's family so that she could personally tell them she was not involved. 'When I saw (the Kerchers) in court I . wanted to speak with them and I asked my lawyers if I could do that. My . lawyer approached them but their lawyers rejected it.’ ’I want to speak to them. I want to tell them I had nothing to do with Meredith's death, that I liked her and we were friends. When asked about Knox's comments, the . Kercher family's lawyer Francesco Maresca said: ’Amanda is the accused. This is the moment of the accused. She should stop her declarations.’ Sollecito's defense lawyer told the appeals court Thursday that the young lovers were blamed by authorities for the murder to calm fears that a monster was loose in their Italian university town. Defender Giulia Bongiorno said Sollecito and Knox were identified as suspects by police in a 'record' four days after the murder because authorities 'did not want to think that a stranger, a monster, could have entered a house and murdered a student'. Bongiorno said much of the evidence later used to convict the pair in their first trial - including the presumed murder weapon found in Sollecito's kitchen drawer and a clasp that had been ripped from Kercher's bra - had not even been gathered by investigators at that point. Bongiorno, on the last day of closing arguments in the pair's third trial, showed a court slides and videos in a bid to dismantle the prosecution's case. Sollecito sat at her side. If she is convicted prosecutors have . demanded Knox be jailed for 30 years and would seek her extradition from . the United States. Prior to the retrial, Sollecito had been spending a considerable . amount of time in the Dominican Republic, and though he also risks jail, he has . insisted he will remain in Italy for the verdict.

"By . Nick Pisa . A fireman is in a serious condition after a fancy dress holiday stunt went tragically wrong when a cable snapped and sent him crashing into a church bell tower. Father of two Salvatore Alfano, 45, suffered serious head injuries after slamming into the brickwork and was instantly knocked out in front of horrified spectators including dozens of children who had gathered to watch the event. Alfano had been dressed as the 'Befana', an old woman who is part of the traditional end of Christmas festivities and had offered to take part in the stunt which involved him hurtling down a zip wire suspended between the bell tower and a nearby building. Scroll down for video . A fireman is in a serious condition after a fancy dress holiday stunt went tragically wrong when a cable snapped and sent him crashing into a church bell tower . But the cheery mood turned to tragedy after the cable snapped briefly suspending him high above the square in Caserta near Naples before he swung into the bell tower of the town's 100 year old St Micheal the Archangel Cathedral. Footage taken at the scene and posted on the website of  the local newspaper showed Alfano's motionless body suspended and swinging from side to side, 20ft from the ground, as shocked onlookers screamed in horror before he was lowered down and given first aid. Paramedics were quickly on the scene and he was rushed to the nearby Sant Anna hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a serious head injury and today doctors said he was in a 'serious condition' and they could not rule out further surgery. The cable snapped briefly suspending Salvatore Alfano, 45,  high above the square in Caserta near Naples . He then swung into the bell tower of the town's 100 year old St Micheal the Archangel Cathedral . Following the incident the rest of the event was cancelled with officials expressing their solidarity towards Alfano and his family. Local mayor Pio del Gaudio said:'It was terrible - one minute he was throwing sweets to the children in the crowd, the next the cable snapped and he crashed into the church tower at high speed. 'People were screaming and he was hanging there completely still, at first I thought he had been killed but the paramedics did a fantastic job and he was taken straight to hospital where he had an operation. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and colleagues. It was not a particularly dangerous event and it has been taking place in the town for years but obviously after what happened everything was cancelled. Footage taken at the scene showed Alfano's motionless body suspended and swinging from side to side, 20ft from the ground, as shocked onlookers screamed in horror before he was lowered down and given first aid . 'The whole thing only lasted a few seconds. The cause of what happened will be investigated but an initial examination of the scene looks like it was due to the brickwork giving way and unable to hold the mechanism down securely.' Police spokesman Alberto Negro said:'We have examined the scene and will carry out a thorough investigation to establish the cause oft he incident. We are also asking for people who filmed what happened to let us have their footage.' Traditionally in Italy the Befana is an old woman who hands out sweets to good children on Epiphany Eve (January 5) in a similar way to Father Christmas and it is the last festival of Christmas taking place just ahead of Twelfth Night - the day when the Three Kings are said to have visited Christ in Bethlehem.","Father of two Salvatore Alfano, 45, suffered serious head injuries .

"By . Nick Pisa . A Costa Concordia crew member has told a court how she was ordered to tell passengers 'everything was under control' after the packed luxury cruise ship struck rocks and was fatally holed. Jacqueline Abad Quine was a deputy cabin services director and was on duty the night the ship hit the reefs after its captain Francesco Schettino altered course to carry out a 'sail-by salute' of an island. She was later seen in video footage trying to reassure passengers who had gathered on decks close to lifeboat stations and described to the hearing the scene of panic and confusion in the minutes following the incident. Schettino, pictured, is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning the Costa Concordia after it hit rocks. Crew member Jacqueline Abad Quine told his trial she was ordered to send passengers back to their cabins . Mrs Quine said: 'I was ordered to . tell the passengers everything was under control. I was told to say that . there was a blackout and everyone should return to their cabins and . that things would be returning to normal as quickly as possible. 'But . people were agitated and worried - they wanted to get onto the . lifeboats but the order didn't come. When the passengers got to the . muster stations I was told to try and calm them down, to reassure them.' More . than 4,000 passengers and crew - including 35 Britons - were onboard . the Costa Concordia when it struck an underwater reef off the coast of . the Italian island of Giglio just hours after setting sail on a . seven-day Mediterranean cruise in January last year. Mrs . Quine broke down in tears as she told the hearing in the Italian town . of Grosseto: 'I made announcements in English, Spanish and Italian. I . called my boss and he said the crew were frightening the passengers with . what they were saying. 'Children . were hugging their parents, two little ones lost and a were trying to . find them. Reliving everything again now is really hard for me now. The . passengers wanted to get onboard the lifeboats. In the dock: Captain Francesco Schettino seen as he arrives for his trial in the town of Grosseto . Cruise ship Costa Concordia lies stricken off the shore of the island of Giglio in January 2012 . 'They . were pushing each other, trying to get on but we didn't have the order . to let them get onboard. I had to tell everyone that there was an . electrical problem and everything was going to return to normal. 'Eventually . the order to abandon ship came from the second officer - I made a human . chain with others to get onto a lifeboat and there must have been . around 150 people in it. 'When . I looked back the ship had capsized. Everyone on the lifeboat was so . scared and so was I. I prayed to God for help asking him to help us and . to help me so that I knew what to tell the passengers.' Schettino, . who was dubbed Captain Coward after the incident, is accused of . multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the Costa . Concordia while passengers and crew were still onboard. Previously . the court has heard how he ended up in a lifeboat ahead of others and . at the time of the disaster a tape recording emerged of him being . ordered to get back onto the ship by lifeguard officials, but he . refused. Thirty-two . people died in the disaster and last week the remains of one of two . people missing, a Sicilian woman, were positively identified and she was . finally buried. A . waiter, Russel Rebello, is still missing and his remains have yet to be . discovered. The ship was straightened two months ago and has been made . secure for the winter, ahead of being towed to a dry dock on the . mainland next year where she will be scrapped. Later . Francesco Raccomandato, cabin services director, told the court: 'I did . not tell my assistant to tell passengers to return to their cabins. 'I . said that as it was dangerous to remain at the muster stations I . suggested it was better people grouped in the lounges and that they . should get warm clothing and any medication needed.' Salvage operators in Italy lifted the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of Giglio in September, in the biggest ever project of its kind. It will soon be scrapped . He added: 'I did eventually speak to Captain Schettino and asked him what we should tell the passengers was happening, and he said ""just say it's a blackout and we are working on it"".' Mr Raccomandato went on: 'He said that we should also tell everyone to ""keep calm"".' During a break in proceedings, Schettino's lawyer Domenico Pepe also denied that the order to tell passengers to return to their cabins had come from his client and he said: 'Maybe it came from another member of the crew. 'We hope only that among the victims are people who returned to their cabins as a result of this order which I stress again did not come from the captain.' Schettino has insisted that his actions in fact saved lives and by turning the vessel around and bringing the ship virtually to the entrance of Giglio harbour he in fact 'saved thousands of lives'. The trial is not expected to finish until later next year and prosecutors are looking for a 20 year jail sentence against Schettino. A cadet officer told the trial previously that the captain did not 'slip into a lifeboat' as he claimed - but leaped onto one while stricken passengers and crew were still on board. Stefano . Iannelli said: 'I jumped onto the roof [of a lifeboat] but Schettino . was already there, he had jumped just before me. As soon as the lifeboat launched, the ship rolled and the deck where we had been was submerged. We picked up passengers who were in the water as we headed to the shore.' While the rescue was ongoing and Schettino was in the lifeboat, in a widely reported telephone call that was leaked to the media, coastguard chief Gregorio De Falco can be heard ordering him: 'Get back on board, for f***'s sake.' Schettino refused to do so and instead he made his way to a hotel on the island, where he waited for officials to arrive. He was later taken away to the mainland where he was arrested and ultimately charged. Prosecutors say Schettino deliberately altered the course of the Concordia so that he could carry out the sail-by salute of Giglio to impress passengers and islanders, passing fatally close to the reef. The disaster happened on January 13 last year, just hours after the Costa Concordia had left the port of Civitavecchia for a seven-day Mediterranean cruise. Among those on board were 35 British passengers and crew.","Jacqueline Abad Quine broke down during trial of Francesco Schettino .

"By . Nick Pisa . The girlfriend of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is appealing to Pope Francis for help after he was kicked out of parliament following a fraud conviction. Ex-model Francesca Pascale, who at 28 is nearly 50 years younger than Berlusconi, spoke out just hours after senators voted to oust him from the Italian Senate, bringing an end to his infamous 20-year career. Miss Pascale, who was pictured in the front row of a rally outside the billionaire tycoon's house in Rome, told Corriere Della Sera newspaper: 'I am going to ask Pope Francis for help. I want to meet him and make him listen to Berlusconi's story.' 'I want him to listen': Silvio Berlusconi's girlfriend Francesca Pascale (left) is appealing to Pope Francis (right) for help in getting the former Italian prime minister back into politics after he was thrown out of parliament . By his side: Silvio Berlusconi is flanked by Miss Pascale after addressing a rally in Rome shortly before he was expelled from the Italian Senate following his fraud conviction . She wants the leader of the Roman Catholic Church to intervene directly and help Berlusconi clear his name and return to front line politics, but it's unlikely the pontiff will step in and help. In the interview, she also described her fiance's mood after senators voted to kick him out of parliament and how he has vowed to continue fighting political opponents - and how she would be standing by his side whatever happened. She said: 'He's not depressed. He's angry. He has the anger of someone who has suffered an injustice. 'He just has a dream. He wants to make the country free. He will fulfil it. 'Silvio is what made me fall in love with him, he's not born to be alone and enjoy his wealth. It's against his nature, for him politics is a form of donation to others. Loyal supporter: Miss Pascale, who was pictured in the front row of a rally outside the billionaire tycoon's house in Rome, said she wanted the Pope to 'listen to Berlusconi's story' 'Even when he was thinking of throwing . it in, he was also building hospitals for children in Africa, . universities for young people and his beloved Milan (football club). 'They . think they will erase him. Instead they are just making him more . determined to fight for freedom. I am with him, I will stay with him, . whatever his decision.' Two . months ago, Miss Pascale gave an interview to a glossy Italian weekly in . which she revealed she had first fallen in love with 77-year-old . Berlusconi when she was a teenage activist in his Forza Italia party. There . were unconfirmed reports last month that the two had married and they . have been pictured several times cosying up together at various . restaurants, as well as in the stands at AC Milan's San Siro stadium. Forza Italia party's supporters wave flags as Silvio Berlusconi addresses a rally in Rome . Senators voted to expel Berlusconi after he was convicted earlier this year of tax fraud and sentenced initially to four years jail, which was later reduced to 12 months community service. Although technically he can no longer serve as a politician, the three times PM has vowed he will continue to be a vocal force in politics from the sidelines, with his newly launched Forza Italia party. Before the vote, he claimed he had new documents which would prove he was innocent of tax fraud and urged senators to delay the vote so they could look at them and clear him, but they ignored his appeals and it has since emerged the evidence is flawed. Three-times married Berlusconi has always insisted that he is the 'most persecuted man since Jesus Christ' and that he is being deliberately targeted by left wing magistrates who are out to get him. Besides his tax fraud conviction, he was also found guilty in the summer of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of office which resulted in a seven year prison sentence which has gone to an automatic appeal.","Francesca Pascal wants Pope to help get shamed PM back into politics .

"By . Nick Pisa . Raffaele Sollecito has paid a secret visit to the grave of murdered student Meredith Kercher, it has emerged. Computer studies graduate Sollecito, 29, is currently back on trial accused of the brutal knife killing, along with his former girlfriend Amanda Knox, 26. The news that he went to Meredith's grave will come as a shock to members of her family, who have asked several times that Knox stay away from the final resting place - despite her making several pleas to visit. Raffaele Sollecito, right,  has paid a secret visit to the grave of murdered student Meredith Kercher, it has emerged. Sollecito, 29, is currently back on trial accused of the brutal knife killing, along with Amanda Knox . Details of Sollecito's secret trip to the grave emerged during an Italian TV programme to mark the sixth year anniversary of the murder in Perugia, and came just days before he is due to attend the retrial ordered by Italy's Supreme Court earlier this year. According to the programme Sollecito was taken to the cemetery at Coulsdon, Surrey, by an English friend of his while visiting London in March - at the same time as the retrial was announced. He did not ask for permission from Meredith's family and, according to the Quarto Grado show, 'said a silent prayer' for the British student but he did not leave any flowers. Knox, left, stunned the Kercher family saying that she hoped one day she could visit Kercher's grave. However Meredith's sister Stephanie Kercher, made it clear the family will not concede to her wish . Meredith had arrived in Perugia in September 2007 to study Italian as part of her University of Leeds course, and she had shared a house with Amanda Knox and two other women . The Kercher family have never accepted Sollecito and Knox's insistence they had nothing to do with Meredith's murder - the 20-year-old was found semi naked with her throat cut in her bedroom in the house she shared with Knox and two Italian women. In September Knox stunned the Kercher family with a bizarre request, saying that she hoped one day she could visit the final resting place of her friend. However in a statement Meredith's sister Stephanie Kercher made it clear the family will not concede to her wish, as she said: 'Her grave is now the safest place for her, she can rest in peace and be with us. I hope that is respected by everybody. 'It took five years for us to be ready as a family to bury Meredith, and even today it is still extremely painful. Now she has a place where we and her friends can go spend some time with her and take her some flowers. 'I hope that she can continue to rest . in peace, despite the judicial process still ongoing but, knowing Mez, . she will fight until the end. The 6th of November 2007 was the hardest day . of my life. I had to go to Italy to identify the body of my little . sister, stretched out cold and lifeless. 'I . would not wish that on anyone, it is something I will never forget. My . mother and I were the last ones to hug Mez that day, to let her know that . we were there and that we were there to bring her home.' Knox . and then boyfriend Sollecito were arrested and . charged five days after the murder in November 2007. At their initial . trial in 2009 they were convicted and sentenced to 26 years and 25 years . respectively. But two years later an appeal court sensationally overturned the original verdict and they were immediately freed, with Knox flying back to her home in Seattle - where she was given a hero's welcome - and Sollecito returning to his home in Bisceglie near Bari. However, it has since emerged that he has moved to the Caribbean island of the Dominican Republic - but his father has insisted he will return later this week to appear at the trial in Florence, where he is expected to make a formal statement to the court. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito pictured outside the rented house in Perugia, Italy on November 2, 2007, the day after British student Meredith Kercher was murdered . Italian police surround the rented home in Perugia, Italy where Miss Kercher was discovered in November 2007 with her throat cut . Last week a fresh forensic report ordered by the court was leaked and it revealed that although Knox's DNA was on a knife believed to be the murder weapon, crucially there was no trace of Kercher or Sollecito on it. Sollecito's father Francesco said:'I have communicated the results to my son and naturally he is delighted. We have always said he had nothing to do with the death of poor Meredith. He is living in the Dominican Republic at the moment but he will return this week for the trial.' Mr Sollecito added he had 'no details' of his son's visit to the grave but said his son has always felt huge sympathy for the Kercher family for the loss of Meredith. Drifter Rudy Guede, 26, was convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 years and he could be released on parole by 2018.","Sollecito went to the cemetery in Coulsdon, Surrey, in March with a friend .

"By . Nick Pisa . A cadet officer has told an Italian court how Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino did not 'slip into a lifeboat' as he claims but jumped off while stricken passengers and crew were still on board. Stefano Iannelli was giving evidence during the trial in which Schettino is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning the Costa Concordia after the luxury liner struck rocks off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio. Thirty-two people died in the disaster and the trial has focused on the behaviour of Schettino, who was dubbed 'Captain Coward' after it emerged he had refused orders by coastguards to get back on board and help coordinate the rescue efforts. Schettino, pictured, is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning the Costa Concordia after it hit rocks. Crew member Jacqueline Abad Quine told his trial she was ordered to send passengers back to their cabins . Iannelli told the hearing in Grosseto: 'Captain Schettino, shortly before me, jumped onto the roof of a lifeboat by deck four, shortly afterwards the area where we were, was then underwater as the Concordia slipped on the rocks. 'We had formed a human chain so as not to slip, I was part of that team named Tango India and we helped five people who had been hurt. 'Then when I couldn't see any more passengers, together with Schettino and four others we went to went to where the lifeboats were. 'I jumped onto the roof but Schettino was already there, he had jumped just before me. As soon as the lifeboat launched, the ship rolled and the deck where we had been was submerged. We picked up passengers who were in the water as we headed to the shore.' In the dock: Captain Francesco Schettino seen as he arrives for his trial in the town of Grosseto . Schettino has insisted that he 'tripped and fell' into a lifeboat as the 290m luxury liner lay stricken on rocks just off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio but prosecutors insist he failed in his duty and fled the scene while more than 300 people were still onboard. According to the investigation Schettino was on dry land just after midnight, nearly three hours after the Concordia has initially struck the rocks but the last person was not rescued until 4am. Iannelli painted a vivid picture of the frantic panic that had gripped Schettino after he had steered the liner, which had more than 4,000 passengers and crew onboard, onto the rocks and said: 'He was saying ""What have I done? I'm finished sailing."" 'My job was to monitor the equipment and make sure the ship was stable during sailing and I remember just as we struck the rocks there were vibrations and I could hear that we had scraped the bottom.' Cruise ship Costa Concordia lies stricken off the shore of the island of Giglio in January 2012 . Iannelli ended his testimony to the court by telling prosecutor Stefano Pizza that he had been told by other officers on the bridge, that Schettino had a 'briefcase with him between his legs' as he escaped in the lifeboat to safety. While the rescue was ongoing and Schettino was in the lifeboat, in a widely reported telephone call that was leaked to the media, coastguard chief Gregorio De Falco can be heard ordering him:''Get back on board, for f***'s sake.' But Schettino refused to do so and instead he made his way to a hotel on the island where he waited for officials to arrive and he was later taken away to the mainland where he was arrested and ultimately charged. Salvage operators in Italy lifted the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of Giglio in September, in the biggest ever project of its kind. It will soon be scrapped . In a break during the hearing, Alessandro Maria Lecci, a lawyer representing the island of Giglio, said: 'Everyone knew that night the Concordia's route - you just had to watch it on the internet and various marine traffic websites - you could see that the ship had changed route.' Prosecutors say that Schettino deliberately altered the course of the Concordia so that he could carry out the sail by salute of Giglio and so impress passengers and islanders but it was a course of action that proved dramatically and tragically foolhardy. The disaster happened on January 13, 2012, just hours after the Costa Concordia had left the port of Civitavecchia for a seven day Mediterranean cruise and on board there were 35 British passengers and crew. If convicted Schettino faces a minimum of 20 years in jail - meanwhile salvage experts confirmed today that the Concordia has been made secure in the face of strong winter storms forecast to hit the area, with a system of 28 steel anchors.","Francesco Schettino is accused of multiple manslaughter and abandoning the Costa Concordia .

"By . Amanda Williams . and Nick Pisa . Silvio Berlusconi has claimed that prostitutes brought to his house by an associate, simply lifted his morale, and that he had no idea they were call girls. The former Italian prime minister said that he believed the call girls, brought to his house in 2009 by businessman Giampaolo Tarantini, were his guest's friends, adding that if he had wanted to invite prostitutes he could easily do so. He made the comments during an exchange with magistrate Pasquale Drago in May, the details of which were published by  Italy's newspapers on Sunday. Silvio Berlusconi has claimed that prostitutes, brought to his house by an associate, simply lifted his morale, and that he had no idea they were call girls . It comes as his 28-year-old girlfriend Francesca Pascale vowed she will 'marry him' in a fawning joint interview with him . He claimed he had asked his butler to position the women opposite him in order 'to lift up my morale' and strongly denied that he had known they were prostitutes, the Telegraph reports. Mr Berlusconi is currently facing investigation on suspicion of paying Mr Tarantini 500,000 euros to tell investigators that the Italian former prime minister had no idea the women he met were paid escorts. Patrizia D'Addario has claimed she had sex with Berlusconi and that he knew she was a prostitute. It comes as his 28-year-old girlfriend vowed she will 'marry him' in a fawning joint interview with him. Brunette Francesca Pascale, who at 28 is 49 years younger than billionaire media tycoon Berlusconi, said that she had always wanted to marry him - even when she was just a little girl. Both are pictured on the front cover of the latest Italian edition of Vanity Fair magazine - him with a broad cheesy grin in an armchair pointing at her, while she is sat by his side with her arm around him . Both are pictured on the front cover of the latest Italian edition of Vanity Fair magazine - him with a broad cheesy grin in an armchair pointing at her, while she is sat by his side with her arm around him. Miss Pascale has been at Berlusconi's side through several turbulent events this past year, including his conviction for sex with an underage prostitute, abuse of office and tax fraud, as well as his general election defeat seven months ago. But that has not diminished her romantic feelings for him as she told the magazine: 'I was a little girl when I got it into my head that I wanted to marry him,' as she described how she had first met Berlusconi at a political rally in October 2006. She said: 'I asked if I could leave him my telephone number, I even asked for his as well. He told me ""You're very pushy.""' At the time Berlusconi was married to . his second wife Veronica Lario and Miss Pascale described how she told . her shocked parents she was in love with him: 'They said they admired . him as well but they also said ""He's old enough to be your father.""' But . she continued to pursue him, even though he had told her: 'It's out of . the question - you are too young,' adding curiously: 'I can't give you . the future you deserve.' Silvio Berlusconi waves to supporters as his girlfriend Francesca Pascale looks on during a rally to protest his tax fraud conviction . She was also pictured at his side at the San Siro stadium watching his beloved AC Milan football team with him . Miss Pascale, who has appeared as a TV showgirl, stood by his side during his trial revolving around an under age prostitute he paid and who attended his infamous Bunga Bunga parties where aspiring models and wannabes were eager to perform seductive stripteases for him in a luxury villa near Milan. She has strongly defended him and has cooed about how she loved his policies in previous interviews. Miss Pascale told the magazine: 'Women were throwing themselves at him but he was going through a period of disillusionment and inability of showing true love for a woman. 'In his eyes I was deluded, a dreamer. It wasn't easy for me. I didn't go to those dinners (parties) because I would not have been able to contain myself.' During the last few years of his period in office before he resigned in 2011, Miss Pascale was seen driving into his official residence in Rome and she was also pictured at his side at the San Siro stadium watching his beloved AC Milan football team with him. She added: 'At first I would just satisfy myself by being close to him, to spend time with him, I had to bite my tongue but now love has taken me to the happiness I feel today. I sought him out, I courted him and I made him fall in love with me. I practically did everything and still do - all he has to do is say yes.' Berlusconi was sentenced to seven years in prison in June for paying an under age prostitute, Karima El Mahroug, who attended his parties in Milan. He has denied the charges and is now appealing . In December of last year and while still officially married to Ms Lario, Berlusconi confirmed that he was seeing Miss Pascale who he described as 'beautiful on the inside and beautiful on the outside' and on Valentine's Day they were photographed kissing and cuddling at a Rome restaurant. Twice married Berlusconi, who has two children from his first wife and three from his second, told Vanity Fair: 'In all of the painful moments during the last few years, Francesca has been by my side. She has gifted me joy, without asking for anything in return. She has given me the desire to believe in the sincere love of a woman.' In June Berlusconi was given a seven year sentence for having sex with an underage prostitute and he is appealing the verdict insisting he is innocent of the charge. He has also been given four years for tax fraud. He is said to be rehearsing a nationwide prime time TV appearance in which he will once again attack judges for deliberately targeting him and he will insist that he is going to continue his fight against them and stay in politics.","Former Italian PM said he believed call girls were his guest's friends .

"By . Nick Pisa . The house where British student Meredith Kercher was brutally murdered has been put up for sale by its owner for £384,000, it emerged today. With its white washed stone walls and spectacular views of the nearby rolling countryside, the ten bedroom property would make an ideal holiday home but with its grim background potential buyers maybe put off. A 'for sale' sign went up outside Via della Pergola in Perugia earlier this week and the house is also being advertised on a local estate agents website but there is no obviously mention of Meredith's murder in November 2007 - she was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom. For sale: The property in Perugia, Italy, where Meredith Kercher was found dead in 2007 has been put on the market by its elderly owner . Victim: British student Meredith Kercher was found dead in her bedroom with a slit throat . Aldalia Tattanelli, 70, owner of the house, contacted an estate agent earlier this month with a view to selling the property as she lives in 150 miles away in Rome and no longer wants anything to do with it. The advert describes the two storey property as 'close to the university of foreigners, with a complex character composed of two independent properties, with the prospect of converting into one or making into three, comes with 5,000mq2 of land and parking for seven cars. In excellent condition.'. Meredith moved into the house in August 2007 after spotting an advert for it shortly after arriving in Perugia where she was due to spend a year studying at the university and her fellow tenants were two Italian women and American student Amanda Knox. Within weeks of moving in Meredith was dead and Knox, now 26, was charged with murdering and sexually assaulting her, with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 30, and they were both initially convicted but then had their convictions quashed two years ago but that was subsequently  overturned earlier this year. Suspects: Amanda Knox, left, and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito pictured outside the property in the days after Meredith was found dead . In court: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, pictured in 2008, were both convicted of Meredith's murder but their convictions were quashed two years ago . For two years following the murder the house was under a police confiscation order before it was then returned to Mrs Tatanelli who eventually re-let it at a reduced price to immigrant tenants from Bangladesh and the Congo who were students at the nearby university. Since then there has been a steady flow of tenants in and out of the house but it has also been noted for several high profile incidents including being broken into by Satanists several times as well as most recently last month when the current tenants were rushed to hospital after being overcome by carbon monoxide from a faulty heater. The family of eight Moroccans including two newborn babies were living in the basement flat of the house but the upper floor where Meredith and Knox lived is currently unoccupied. Estate agent Vincenzo Russo, who is handing the sale, said: 'We've not had any calls yet about the property but it is still early days. Ongoing: Amanda Knox, pictured in April this year during an interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer, will find out the verdict of an appeal court over Meredith's murder next month . Amanda Knox, pictured in April 2013, has claimed she was 'physiologically tortured' by police investigating the death of Meredith Kercher . 'The sign only went up earlier his week and it's online as well but Christmas has been in between as well so I'm hoping that once the holidays are over we will get some interest. 'It's not a good time of year to market a house but I'm sure we will get calls about it - the house is in excellent position and would make an ideal holiday home or if someone wants to convert it they could get two possibly three separate units and then rent them out to students - it's very close to the university and the centre of town. 'There has been some interest via the internet and I hope that is from genuine buyers as opposed to people having a morbid curiosity in the history of the house. 'I have a feeling though that because of its history the house will be difficult to sell but it should be said that it is in excellent condition and a very good buy for its location.' An appeal court is expected to return its verdict on the fresh hearing against Knox and Sollecito next month.","Aldalia Tattanelli, 70, has contacted estate agents about selling the property .

"By . Nick Pisa . This is the touching moment Pink Floyd star Roger Waters visits a cemetery near where his soldier father died in the final months of World War II. Eric Fletcher Waters was serving as a second lieutenant with the Royal Fusiliers as they advanced through Italy in 1944 when he was killed in action. His newborn son Roger was aged just five months when he was killed on the battlefield near Cassino. Earlier this year, the Pink Floyd musician made an emotional journey to visit the battlefield where his father was killed along with thousands of other Allied troops. He was able to pinpoint the exact spot where he died and also visited a graveyard where his death is marked on a memorial. The second lieutenant's remains were never found. Graveside: Roger Waters of Pink Floyd visits a cemetery in Cassino, Italy, as he makes an emotional journey to visit the battlefield where his father was killed along with thousands of other Allied troops . A war diary belonging to Pink Floyd star Roger Waters' father has been uncovered by a fellow soldier (pictured) the Waters family while father Eric was serving in the Royal Fusiliers . Now, War Diary documents unearthed at the National Archives in Kew by former veteran Harry Shindler, paint a clear picture of the final 24 hours of Lt Waters and the brave men of Z company (coy) who were with him at Anzio in February 1944. The first line dated February 17 records how at 11am 'intensive shelling and mortaring' took place in the area where Lt Waters, commanding officer John Oliver-Bellasis and the rest of Z company as they tried to advance on a heavily defended German position. Later in the day, an entry timed 1745, describes colourfully how the Germans called on Lt Waters and his comrades to give up: 'Z coy reported an attack on the left forward platoon. The bosche called on them to surrender but were answered with all available SA (semi automatic) fire. Casualties were inflicted.' The diary, which documents dramatic dispatches from Mr Waters' time in service . Just over an hour later, the entry adds: 'Situation well in hand, enemy decided to withdraw. 'Prisoners from Z coy said they had recently marched from Rome and were told they would not be used in an attack. Had also been told that b'head was almost finished.' The report goes on to record a quiet night but then in the early hours of the morning at 1.45am, the day Lt Waters was killed, describes an 'enemy concentration reported on the rt of 7th Oxf & Bucks, which is followed by an entry at 0630 of how the Oxf and Bucks troops are being attacked 'and sounds of tracked vehilces heard to their front.' At 7.15am 'Z coy reported attack by approx 50 Bosches. Successfully dealt with.' More than two hours later at 0945am it adds: '5 enemy killed and several spandaus captured as result of above.' Then 30 minutes later the battle which will claim Lt Waters life begins. On the offensive: This picture shows troops landing in Anzio, on the Italian coast, in 1944 . It reads: 'Further attack on Z coy. This time in greater strength than previous attack. Enemy in close contact with forward positions. Unable to send assistance as Z coy having trouble on their rt.' An hour later the Diary records: 'Z coy reported enemy all round their positions, very stiff fighting going on.' Then at 1130am the final report reads: 'Lt Waters killed and Lt Hill wounded, situation now critical. Message received over air that assistance would now be too late.' Lt Waters was killed in the first wave of fighting as the Allies attempted to secure the beach head at Anzio, south of Rome. Lt Waters name is on a memorial at the nearby Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Cassino but his remains were never found. Eric Waters' death provided the inspiration for several songs and it is commemorated in particular with When The Tigers Broke Free, which also appeared in the film The Wall. In the song, Waters describes how he feels that his 31-year-old father died because of foolhardy generals. The last verse has the lyrics 'It was dark all around. There was frost in the ground When the tigers broke free. And no one survived  From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z. They were all left behind, Most of them dead. 'The rest of them dying. And that's how the High Command Took my daddy from me.' Emotional time: The film and album The Wall tells the story of how a troubled rock star called Pink, who is said to be Waters, is left psychologically scarred by the loss of his father in the war . He also describes coming across a letter of condolence from George V as he tried on his father's uniform, adding how he found it disturbing that it was rubber-stamped and not actually signed. After visiting the cemetery at Cassino in March, Waters, 70, told a local Italian TV station: 'I'm on a journey through Europe, my grandfather was killed in 1916 and my father was killed down the road in Anzio. This is the end of my journey. 'Some of my past is in my music and so is my future. I'm making a film that won't be aired in public.' Speaking of his father, Waters recalled in an interview his childhood and how his father's death had affected him. He said: 'When men in uniform came to collect their children, that's when I realised I didn't have a father anymore. 'I was very angry. It took me years to come to terms with it. Because he was missing in action, presumed killed, until quite recently I expected him to come home. The sacrifice of his life has been a great gift and a great burden to me.' The film and album The Wall tells the story of how a troubled rock star called Pink, who is said to be Waters, is left psychologically scarred by the loss of his father in the war. The film opens with scenes of a solider - Eric Waters - along with his comrades, storming a beachhead. Mr Shindler, 93, a veteran who fought in Italy during Word War Two and is in charge of the Itay Star Association which represents former soldiers, said: 'I started to dig around on the story when I saw a report of this man on the TV. 'I was very moved that he wanted to find out more about his father's death and the circumstances of how he was killed. I don't know who Pink Floyd are, my music stops at The Beatles. 'The report describes the events leading up to his father's death and how they were surrounded and outnumbered but despite putting on a brave fight their was nothing they could do.' Mr Shindler adds that he had been in touch with Roger Waters agent but had no direct contact with the musician who recently completed a successful tour of Europe. On his official website Waters has posted a tribute to his father and urged fans to send in photos and stories of their 'Fallen Loved Ones'. He writes it 'is a request, from me, reaching out to ask you to provide a photograph and personal details of a ""Loved One"" lost in war. Your ""Loved One’s"" pictures and details would be included, along with those of my father Eric, in my up coming show THE WALL, as an act of remembrance. The ""Fallen Loved One"" does not have to have been a soldier. Civilian deaths are equally, if not more, harrowing. 'I make this request to you in light of my belief that many of these tragic losses of life are avoidable. I feel empathy with the families of all the victims and anger at ""THE POWERS THAT BE"", who are responsible, in equal measure. Please join me in honouring our dead and protesting their loss.'","Roger Waters' father Eric died in Italy in the closing stages of the war .

"By . Nick Pisa . Connor Smith, 19, suffered fatal multiple injuries after falling from his quad during the race . A British quad bike rider has been killed in a horrific accident during a competition in Italy. Connor Smith, 19, suffered fatal multiple injuries after falling from his quad and then being hit several times by other riders in the race. Paramedics were immediately on the scene and the event was stopped as emergency crews battled to save his life and he was taken to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead. Connor was killed in the first race of the European Quad of Nations championships which were being held in Cingoli near Ancona, in Central Italy. He had arrived at the weekend event race event last Friday with team mates Paul Holmes and Luke Cooper and they had been among the favourites to win. Because of funding only a small team had been entered in the race and earlier this month an appeal had gone out for sponsorships via quad bike websites. Besides Connor, an Italian rider Filippo Rondinini, 27, was also injured in the pile up and he was taken to hospital but his condition was not described as serious. Officials cancelled the event as soon as the teenager's death was confirmed and a minute's silence was held in memory of the rider, who was thought to be from Scotland. An entry on the Facebook page of Quad Scotland read: 'Connor Smith RIP . 'Deeply saddened and shocked to learn today of the tragic loss of Connor Smith, our 2013 Champion; a great friend, committed competitor and huge inspiration to quad riders young and old, in Scotland and beyond. The teenager was competing as part of the British team at the event which was held in Cingoli near Ancona, in Central Italy . 'He achieved so much in his short life, and had so much still to give. Our thoughts and sympathies go to Bill, Jackie, family and friends.' An ambulance spokesman in Cingoli said: 'We tried what we could to save the British rider's life but there was nothing we could do. He had suffered serious injuries after falling off and then being hit by other riders. A tribute to Connor described him as 'a great friend, committed competitor and huge inspiration to quad riders young and old' 'Attempts were made to save his life at the scene and he was then rushed to a nearby hospital but he died from his injuries.' Two other riders were also injured on Saturday but their condition was not serious and they were treated at the Torrette di Ancona hospital. After the death was announced to the crowd a message was read out from his father which said: 'My son Connor died taking part in a sport he lived. He was representing the colours of his nation.' As the message was read out fans applauded and fellow riders gathered at the spot where the accident died to hold a prayer vigil before the race was cancelled. A tribute was also posted on the website of the Italian Quad Bike Federation which read: 'There are no words to describe the state of our souls. 'All the staff, riders, managers and officials from the Italian Quad Bike Federation unite in giving their condolences to the family of Connor Smith, who we are united with in grief and pain.' A police spokesman said they were investigating the accident to establish whether all safety procedures had been implemented and to decide whether anyone should face criminal charges if they were breached.","Connor Smith, 19, was killed in the first race at the event in Congoli, Italy .

"By . Nick Pisa . A wanted Mafia cop killer has been captured by detectives as he sunned himself on a beach. Massimiliano Sestito, 42, was held along with an accomplice after a six week undercover investigation following a tip off. Sestito had been released on parole but failed to return to prison after being convicted of the shooting of police officer Renato Lio, who was gunned down by the mobster when he failed to stop at a police roadblock. Massimiliano Sestito, a Mafia cop killer was arrested in his trunks as he sunbathed on a beach in southern Italy . Holidaymakers looked on stunned as Sestito, dressed only in a pair of swimming trunks, was surrounded by armed police who broke cover on the beach at Centola near Palinuro in southern Italy. Initially he tried to claim police had the wrong man and showed them a false identity card but the ruse failed and he was arrested and taken to a nearby police station, along another man he was with. Last month he was released on parole from a prison near Rome but failed to report into police as ordered and instead went on the run . Police released a picture of him sitting on a towel in his trunks and in handcuffs as an officer stood by. He was originally sentenced to life but this was reduced to 30 years for the 1991 cop killing and is still said to be a key figure in the Calabrian Mafia known as the 'ndrangheta and he is suspected of several other Mafia related crimes such as extortion, racketeering, drug trafficking and he was also the prime suspect in another murder and a further attempted murder. Last month he was released on parole from a prison near Rome but failed to report into police as ordered and instead went on the run - and thought he would be safe soaking up the rays on the beach. One holidaymaker said: 'It was like a scene from a film - one minute everyone was enjoying the suns and the sea, the next there were armed police everywhere screaming at these two guys in their trunks to get down. 'They tried to tell the police they had the wrong people but it didn't work - they put handcuffs on them and took them away. It's not something you see everyday at the beach.' When officers searched the home of the second man arrested, Antonio Gallo, they arrested his mother Anna and also seized original documents in Sestito's name and they were charged with assisting hm in avoiding capture. A police spokesman in Rome said: 'We received information that Sesito was hiding out in the south of Italy and passed it to colleagues based there. 'A surveillance operation was launched and Sestito was tracked down to the beach where he was arrested. He obviously thought he was safe but he was very wrong. He was very surprised to see us and after initially trying to climb he was someone else he was arrested. Holidaymakers looked on stunned as Sestito, dressed only in a pair of swimming trunks, was surrounded by armed police who broke cover on the beach at Centola near Palinuro in southern Italy . 'He has been convicted of murdering a police officer in 1991 and other mafia related crimes and even though he has been in prison the feeling is he has still exerted influence in organised crime circles. He is suspected of ordering a murder earlier this year of a rival in Rome and is also the prime suspect in another attempted murder.' Rome police chief Fulvio della Rocca said: 'This was an excellent operation and I congratulate all those officers involved. They were all highly professional - the man arrested is a key figure within the 'ndrangheta who are spreading their influence across Rome.' It is not the first time that a wanted mobster has been arrested on a beach - last year crime boss Roberto Mattalone was also captured at the seaside near the southern port city of Reggio Calabria after two years on the run, as he read a book on police anti mafia operations.","Massimiliano Sestito, 42, held after six week undercover investigation .

"By . Nick Pisa . Patrizia Gucci pictured during her trial: She has been released from jail on parole after agreeing to take a part-time job in Milan fashion house Bozart . The former wife of fashion heir Maurizio Gucci, jailed for ordering his murder, has been released after agreeing to parole - two years after she rejected an offer because it would mean getting a job. Patrizia Gucci, 64, hired a hitman to gun down her multi-millionaire ex-husband Maurizio after a maintenance dispute following an acrimonious divorce. She was jailed for 29 years in 1998, later reduced to 26 years on appeal, and in 2011 she was given the chance of parole after having served half her sentence. But she told the board looking into her case: 'No thanks as it would mean getting a job and I have never worked a day in my life.' Now the so-called Black Widow has apparently changed her mind and taken up a part-time job at the Milan fashion house Bozart, where she will remain for the next three years until her sentence is complete, after she had time taken off for good behaviour. Judge Roberta Cossia agreed to her release after Gucci's lawyer Danilo Boungiorno presented a request and also added that she was willing to be taken into the care of social services while working as a style consultant at Bozart. Mr Boungiorno said his client had offered to work at the showroom after she contacted them from her cell at Milan's San Vittore prison. It is a complete reversal from 2011 when she said 'I would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants,' adding she wanted to stay inside because she wanted to take care of her pet ferret. Gucci's initial decision was not entirely a surprise to those that know her. She once famously summed up her lavish luxury lifestyle, which included apartments in Milan and St Moritz, by saying: 'I'd rather cry in a Rolls then by happy on a bicycle.' Gucci who has two daughters Allegra, 31, and Alessandra, 38, had previously been allowed out on day release to visit them and her elderly mother at the Milan flat where the family lived when her husband was still alive. Her original trial heard how she ordered the murder of her husband in 1995, after he offered her $650,000 in a divorce settlement. She rejected the settlement, describing it as a 'plate of lentils' and insisting she wanted at least $1million. When Mr Gucci refused she hired hitman Benedetto Ceraulo, who shot him four times as he arrived at his office on March 27, 1995. Plot: Maurizio Gucci, pictured left in 1994, was shot four times by hitman Benedetto Ceraulo, shown right in the defendants cage at his trial in 1998,  as he arrived for work at his office in central Milan on March 27, 1995 . Gucci was found guilty of ordering 46-year-old Mr Gucci's death after her clairvoyant and confidante Pina Auriemma turned informer and told police about the plot. The trial, where it emerged that the defendant was furious after she discovered her husband had dumped her for a younger woman, captivated not only Italians but the world. Gucci - who arrived in court in designer outfits every day - told the judge and jury of how she had been betrayed by Ms Auriemma, saying: 'Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop. Sooner or later it will get hungry.' Nine years ago her legal team tried to get the conviction overturned on the grounds of her ill health, claiming she had been affected by a brain tumour, but the case fizzled out. Reversal: Gucci had previously rejected offers of parole because she would be compelled to take a job, saying 'I would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants,' and take care of her pet ferret . Bozart's owner Alessandra Brunero said: 'We were very surprised when she contacted us and asked about working for us but we are more than happy to help. She can advise us on window displays and supplies.' The Gucci family was one of Italy's richest and most well known 'dynasty families' and their saga has even been turned into a TV series. Six years ago there were plans for a film about the family with Angelina Jolie in the lead role but the project never took off. Maurizio Gucci was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion company made famous with its double G logo. In the early Nineties the label was hit by problems and he sold it for $120million to a Middle Eastern investment group just two years before his death.","Patrizia Gucci hired a hitman to shoot dead her ex-husband in 1995 .

"By . Nick Pisa . This is the heart-stopping moment a bungling hitman's clumsiness saved the life of his helpless victim - after the would-be killer ran out of bullets as he stood over his target. Suspect Michele Morelli's bad luck turned out to be a blessing for Michele Di Bari, 31, as he stared at the barrel of the handgun thinking his life was about to end. But as the would-be killer pulled the trigger, it simply clicked over and over - leaving him no option but to turn and flee. Morelli, 24, was eventually captured after detectives got hold of CCTV footage showing a suspected hitman scarpering from the scene. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Winged: Di Bari is hit in the leg and crumples to the floor after being chased by a man with a gun . Death looms: But the pistol only clicks as the gunman repeatedly pulls the trigger . Fortunate one: The gunman flees and Di Bari escapes with his life . It is the latest in a series of murders and attempted murders this month that are so far believed to be linked to the mafia. Di . Bari, a car salesman, can be seen begging for his life as renowned . crook Morelli stands over him in a deserted street in the southern . Italian town of Foggia. Although the district is prime territory of the local mafia, known as the Sacra Corona Unita, police believe it was a personal vendetta. The film begins with Morelli cycling down a street and his victim standing in between two parked cars. A few minutes later, Di Bari is seen running along the street being chased by the gunman who is firing wildly at him, hitting several parked cars and missing his target. Initial pursuit: The intended victim flees as bullets fly past him . The would-be assassin follows closely behind, firing wildly . Eventually one bullet strikes Di Bari in the leg causing him to crash to the floor on a corner. A man said to be Morelli approaches and stands over him as his target begs for his life. Aiming at his head, he coldly pulls the trigger several times. But after his six failed shots earlier, he has run out of bullets so he simply turns and runs off. Di Bari is seen writhing in agony before a camera further up the street again picks up Morelli running away - leaving his victim in agony, but still alive. Suspect Morelli was arrested after police seized CCTV which they believe shows him running from the scene . Paramedics were quick to the scene and an ambulance took him to a local hospital for treatment to a serious leg wound. Police recovered several bullets which had struck parked cars and Morelli was arrested days later. He is now in custody accused of attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm. He is known to police and has minor convictions. Beyond his own criminal activity, Morelli was the victim of an attempted murder four years ago. Michele Pucci, head of Foggia Flying Squad, said: 'Di Bari can consider himself a very lucky man indeed. Collateral damage: A car is gouged by a bullet . One of the bullet casings at the scene . 'The footage clearly shows just how close he came to being killed - he certainly had a guardian angel or some divine protection that day because he could very well be dead now. It was a miracle escape for him. 'Morelli was using a small handgun, 7.65 calibre, and had fired six times at Di Bari, all of the bullets except one hit parked cars and missed him but one did catch him in the leg, leaving him with a serious injury. 'Luck was smiling on Di Bari. But not Morelli as we eventually caught up with him and arrested him after he was recognised from the footage.' The motive for the shooting is still unclear as Di Bari and Morelli have both refused to speak to police. Investigators believe it could possibly be over a car sale, drugs or territorial rivalry.","CCTV shows a gunman standing over victim and attempting to shoot .

"By . Nick Pisa . and Peter Allen . Stunned: Shop worker Anna Romano, 35, was shocked to answer her mobile and hear Pope Francis on the end of the line. He reassured her about her decision to keep her unborn child . Pope Francis has telephoned a woman who wrote to him to tell her he will baptise her unborn after she refused to have an abortion. The call was the latest in a string of 'one to ones' Pope Francis has had with general members of the public and once again underlined his attempts at being a more human and in-touch pontiff after the 'stuffy' years of his predecessor Benedict XVI. Shop worker Anna Romano, 35, was on holiday when she received the call from the Argentinian pope, who was elected in March this year. Anna, from Arezzo near Florence, central Italy, had written to Pope Francis earlier this summer to describe her turmoil at having discovered she was pregnant by a man, who unknown to her, was already married with a child and who demanded she terminate the pregnancy. In her letter she described to the Pope her dilemma and said to him: 'I have never been lucky with men, I married when I was young and then things didn't work out and I got divorced. I then had a few brief relationships until I met a man who I thought was the man of my dreams. 'In June I discovered I was pregnant through him and when I told him instead of being happy he told me he was already married, already had a child and to have an abortion. 'I told him that I would not have an abortion and told him to get out of my life.' Anna added how she was 'in a desperate and anguished state' and that she was writing to Pope Francis because she had 'no-one else to turn to, after being left humiliated and betrayed'. Speaking from her home she added: 'I addressed the letter simply to Pope Francis, the Vatican and put it in the post. I didn't even send it recorded delivery. I didn't really expect to get a reply but then out of the blue when I was on holiday I had a phone call from him. 'The number was from Rome, with a 06 dial code, and as soon as he started speaking I recognised the voice as his. 'I was just so surprised that he had telephoned me. He said that he had read my letter and he wanted to speak to me personally about it and reassure me that someone was worried about me. 'We were only on the phone for a few minutes but my heart was filled with joy, as we spoke I was rubbing my tummy at the same time. 'Hello. It's the Pope here': Pope Francis spoke with Ms Romano for a few minutes, and she said her 'heart was filled with joy' 'I had only seen the Pope once before, from St Peter's Square when I lived in Rome, I would never have imagined that the Pope would pick up a telephone and call me and speak to me as if I was a dear friend. 'He reassured me and said a child was a gift from God, a sign of Divine Providence and that I would never be left alone. He said that as Christians we should never be afraid. 'He told me I had been very brave and strong for my unborn child. I told him that I wanted to baptise the baby when it was born but I was afraid as I was divorced and a single mother but he said he would be my spiritual father and he would baptise my baby. 'I'm not sure if he will, I feel as if I am dreaming but if he did baptise my baby it would be something else, that telephone call has changed my life. 'I hope my letter will be an example for other women who feel they may be distant from the Church simply because they have chosen the wrong man, they are divorced or they are with men who are not worthy of being fathers. 'I don't know the sex of the baby but if the Pope does baptise it and it's a boy I have no doubt of his name - Francis.' Popular new Pope: A view of St. Peter's square during the inauguration mass of Pope Francis, Vatican City, on March 19 this year . The phone call was the latest in a string that Pope Francis has made since he was elected and underlines his hands on, man of the people style which has also recently included him posing for a 'selfie' photograph with a group of tourists inside St Peter's Basilica. He usually makes his calls from a landline in his office and simply says 'Hello. It's the Pope,' to the amazement of recipients who have included an Italian student last month, as well as a man whose brother was killed, his local newsagent back home in Buenos Aries to cancel his newspapers and a shoemaker to tell him not to bother making the traditional and expensive bright red papal loafer shoes. A Vatican spokesman said: 'I know nothing of this telephone call but then again we knew nothing of the others. The Pope doesn't tell us when he makes these calls - he just does them and then we find out about them later.'","Anna Romano was on holiday when her mobile rang with an unknown Rome number .

"By . Nick Pisa . This is the sight that greeted shocked passengers when an easyJet flight was forced to make an emergency landing after an engine cover fell away as it took off. Terrified holidaymakers onboard the flight were put through the evacuation drill before the Airbus A320 returned to the airport it had just taken off from to land safely. Fire engines were on standby but the passengers and crew were all taken off the packed jet safely using the staircase without emergency chutes having to be deployed. Terrified: Holidaymakers onboard the flight were put through the evacuation drill before the Airbus A320 returned to the airport it had just taken off from to land safely . Standby: Fire engines were on standby but the passengers and crew were all taken off the packed jet safely using the staircase without emergency chutes having to be deployed. The drama happened on Monday evening just seconds after the British registered jet had taken off from Milan's Malpensa airport bound for the Portuguese capital of Lisbon with 174 passengers and six crew onboard. It had reached a take off speed of more than 200mph when it lifted off the runway and the engine cover fell away seconds later - creating a potential disaster for other jets - in 2000 a Concorde crashed in Paris after one of its tyres was punctured by debris lost from a previous plane. Holidaymaker Filippo Guazzini, from Pisa, who was on the easyJet flight with his girlfriend, posted on his Facebook site, how the engine cover came away in front of his eyes. He wrote:'We had just taken off and I looked out the window and saw this piece of metal fly off. 'It fell away right in front of my eyes and I started screaming 'A piece of the wing has gone flying' the cabin crew came and had a look and then one went to tell the captain. He came over the PA system a few minutes later and said there had been a problem and we were turning back. 'We were circling for twenty minutes before we landed again and the crew were trying to keep everybody calm but it was an experience I don't want to go through again.' Unfolded: The drama happened on Monday evening just seconds after the British registered jet had taken off from Milan's Malpensa airport bound for the Portuguese capital of Lisbon with 174 passengers and six crew onboard . Passengers held their breathe as the plane touched down safely with the airport closed while maintenance teams cleared the debris from the runway which had also been spotted falling away by the control tower. Reports said that as the plane landed safely and then put its engines into reverse to brake another piece fell away from the already exposed engine on the left hand wing. During the incident the airport was closed for twenty minutes and two incoming flights were diverted. Passengers were given food and drink vouchers while a new plane was flown in and all the holidaymakers are believed to have got back on a replacement jet that arrived and took off for Lisbon three hours later. Later easyJet confirmed that a handful of passengers had refused to board the replacement plane and a further piece of metal had come from the damaged engine on landing. In a statement the company, based at Luton, said: 'easyJet can confirm that flight EZY2715 from Milan Malpensa Airport to Lisbon on 12 August returned from airborne shortly after take off due to a technical issue with one of the engines. 'The aircraft landed routinely and safely using both engines. All passengers disembarked and easyJet provided an alternative aircraft so they were able to continue their journey to Lisbon later that evening. 'The safety of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority. We would like to apologise to passengers for any inconvenience experienced due to the delay. 'easyJet is investigating the technical issue and will work alongside the relevant safety authorities according to our procedures. 'The aircraft was a four year old Airbus A320 with 174 passengers and six crew onboard.'","Terrified holidaymakers onboard the .

As his horrified friends watched, instructors supervising the adventure holiday attempted to revive him. Boy scout Elliot Alexander Peacock, 14, who died during a canyoning expedition in the Italian Alps . The schoolboy emerged from the water unconscious after an ill-judged dive at the Lillaz waterfalls and despite several supervising instructors coming to his rescue he was unable to be revived . Mountain rescue guides believe the teenager, from Glasgow, may have received internal injuries after hitting a rock while diving into a pool between two waterfalls . A helicopter arrived on the scene within minutes but after two hours the teenager was declared dead. Rescue workers said the youth, from Glasgow, may have hit his chest on rocks in an ill-judged dive. He was travelling with a group of 40 children aged between 10 and 17 and was a member of the Eastwood District Scouts. The trip to the Valle D'Aosta was organised by UK-based company called Acorn Adventures which organises adventure holidays for schools and youth groups. They had arrived at the waterfalls at an altitude of 1800m by coach from their accommodation in the village of Villeneuve. A spokesman for the Guardia di Finanza . police in Courmayeur, who are investigating the cause of the tragic . accident, said: 'The boy was on holiday with an adventure group of 40 . young people.They were playing games in a waterfall. Elliott was with a group of 40 other children aged 10 to 17, on a trip run by UK-based company Acorn Adventures which organises adventure holidays for schools and youth groups . 'When he re-emerged from the water he was unconscious. 'There were five instructors in the water and they immediately tried to revive him but they were unable to do so. 'We are carrying out interviews to find out if anyone saw him dive or hit rocks.' The accident happened during an exercise at the Lillaz waterfalls, above, which has an altitude of 1800m . Mountain rescue guide, Dante Bibois, said the teenager, who was wearing a helmet and wetsuit, may have received internal injuries after hitting a rock diving into a pool between two waterfalls. He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: 'There was a lot of water in the river- and the current was strong. There are lots of rocks.' 'He had no visible external injuries - so he may have hit his chest on rocks as he dove.' The Scout Association said it was 'devastated' by the death at the Lillaz waterfalls and was working with Acorn Adventure to support the victim's family . The schoolboy's parents were expected to arrive in the area today, police said. The autopsy will be carried out this week. Acorn Adventure, said of the accident: 'They were jumping into the water, where instructors were waiting for them. All participants were wearing buoyancy aids, wet suits  and helmets as is standard on this activity, carried out by hundreds of participants every year for the past 18 years. 'As yet it is unclear why this participant lost consciousness as he entered the water. Despite very swiftly being given CPR by trained first aiders and nurses who attended the scene, very sadly paramedics were unable to resuscitate him.' The outdoor education provider added: 'The thoughts and condolences of all at Acorn Adventure are with his family and friends; the team's efforts are fully focused on ensuring they are supported in any way possible.' Acorn Adventure said it is working with the Italian emergency services and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ensure the teenager is brought home to his family 'swiftly and respectfully'. Senior operations staff were travelling to Italy to provide all possible support, the company said. The boy was a member of the Pegasus Explorer Scout Unit which is linked to the 35th Glasgow Scout Group. In a statement the Scout Association said: 'We are working with Acorn Adventure to support the family, leaders and other young people involved in this very sad event. 'We are devastated that a young person has died and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the young person at this time.' The Foreign Office said they were aware of the death and were ready to provide consular assistance.","Elliot Alexander Peacock died during an exercise at the Lillaz waterfalls .

Ruby the Heart-stealer, the underage erotic dancer who was paid by Silvio Berlusconi for sex, has said that she wishes she could ‘go back to being a girl who sold carpets on the beach’. The former Italian premier was sentenced to seven years in jail for paying for sex with Ruby, now 22, when she was just 17. In Italy, it is illegal to have sex with a prostitute under the age of 18. Ruby the Heart-stealer, the underage erotic dancer who was paid by Silvio Berlusconi for sex, has said that she wishes she could 'go back to being a girl who sold carpets on the beach' As lawyers for the billionaire politician began the first legal appeal against the guilty sentence in a Milan courtroom, Ruby gave an interview in which she apparently claimed that Berlusconi was the best man she had ever met. Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug, told the newspaper Il Giornale, which is run by Berlusconi’s brother Paolo: ‘The truth is, Berlusconi treated me with more respect than all the other men I had met before at pubs and clubs. 'He got seven years for nothing.' The former nightclub dancer claimed that her life had been ruined, not by the media mogul, but by those who were using her to bring down the former prime minister. She said she found it difficult to keep a job as people assumed she had plenty of money. Ruby added: 'I'm tired.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Pope Francis has met British victims of clerical sex abuse to beg forgiveness for the ‘sacrilegious’ crimes committed by the ‘sons and daughters of the church, who betrayed their mission.’ The Pope told six victims of paedophile priests, including two Britons, that the church would ‘weep’ for its ‘grave sin’ and must make amends through reparations. The meetings follows two damning UN reports on the Vatican this year which said the church had 'systematically' adopted policies that allowed priests to rape and molest tens of thousands of children over decades. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis, left, looks at an iPad with Claudio Maria Celli, centre, president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, on the day he met privately with a small group of victims of paedophile priests . Despite his energetic and wide-ranging reforms, Francis has been accused of lacking in answers when it comes to tackling the child abuse scandal. This was the first time he has met with abuse victims since becoming pope last year. The three women and three men each had private half-hour meetings. As well as two Britons, there were two Irish victims and two Germans. But in his strongest words on the subject so far, Francis promised that bishops who fail to report or cover up abuse will be held accountable. At a mass for the victims at the Vatican, Francis denounced the abuse of minors as ‘worse than despicable.' He said: 'It is like a sacrilegious cult, because these boys and girls had been entrusted to the priestly charism in order to be brought to God.' He lamented that child sex abuse leaves 'life-long scars' and acknowledged that victims have been driven to addiction and even suicide by their experiences. Pope Francis waves as he addresses his Sunday Angelus from a window over St Peter's Square yesterday . Francis listened to the stories of the three men and three women, two each from Ireland, the UK and Germany. The 'intense' meetings lasted more than three hours - an 'exceptional' and ‘extraordinary’ length of time, Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi said. After the individual meetings the victims, who asked not to be identified, were visibly moved, he said. ‘They described their feelings as serene, touched, happy and grateful. It was a very profound spiritual encounter. The Holy Father listened and tried to understand their suffering in a deep sense. ‘They said they felt that they were listened to, which would helped them continue on their path.' Previously Francis has condemned abuse of children as like 'celebrating a Satanic mass'.","The Pope met with six victims of paedophile priests at the Vatican today .

"By . Hannah Roberts . He promised that the Vatican would throw open its convents and monasteries as shelters, while saying that the church must be 'the first port of call' for migrants. But Pope Francis is seemingly remaining silent in the face of a group of 50 immigrant families, who have taken shelter in his favourite church in Rome. Around 120 migrants, including 15 children, have been occupying Santa Maria Maggiore, the giant basilica where Francis goes to seek guidance before every major endeavour, for more than a week. The migrants wrote to Pope Francis, pictured, eight days ago asking for asylum but he has so far not replied . The group, from Algeria, Morocco, Ukraine as well as Romania, have requested asylum from the Vatican after being evicted from their squat in Torre Spracata, a district in south-eastern Rome by Italian authorities. A letter to the Pope asking for help began: ‘Dear Francis, we are men, women and children, inhabitants of Rome and citizens of Planet Earth. ‘We ask that you make yours the wounds that we carry, that you grant us as human beings who have been persecuted, harassed and humiliated by the Italian State, political asylum.’ But after eight days they have heard nothing. The church which is officially Vatican territory like all of the four great Basilicas of Rome shuts to parishioners and pilgrims at 8pm every night whereupon the group lay out their beds on its marble floors. The migrants have been staying inside Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, pictured, said to be one of the Pope's favourite churches in Rome . They rise at 5.30am and tidy their beds away before mass at 7am. During the day some go to work, while others attempt to sleep in an adjoining nave, or care for children playing in the car park. Rome city council has offered the group accommodation, but they refused it because they say there is no electricity there and some of the inhabitants there have tuberculosis. It is not the first time the church has been occupied. In February anti-austerity demonstrators in the Pitchfork Movement set up camp there saying they had urgent questions for Francis. Don Angelo, one of the priests at the church, told La Repubblica: ‘The Basilica is beginning to feel the weight of their presence. 'They are good people.... But unlike other churches we don’t have another room for parishioners or a space to put them in. This is a holy place that at night turns into a dormitory. ‘ .","Migrants have been occupying Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome .

The midfield pass-master fears his tangled private life could have an impact on his performances on the pitch. Pirlo, 35, terrorised England in the Euro 2012 Championships and any crisis of confidence could be good news for Roy Hodgson's men. At training camp in Florence, Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who has recently separated from model wife Alena Seredova, were Don Massimiliano’s top priorities. He also attempted to soothe the anxieties of forward Alessio Cerci, who wept on the pitch after missing a crucial penalty in the final match of the Serie A league. He told Italian TV Rai Sport: 'I consoled Cerci on Sunday evening. He is an emotional and sensitive guy, he should not feel ashamed of his mistake. 'This is life, this is football. It’s a pity, but he will do great things at the World Cup.' The team's spiritual father, a close friend of coach Cesare Prandelli, officiated at a special team mass and held a ceremony of blessing for the squad before they left for Brazil. 'I am convinced that Italy will have a great World Cup,' the chaplain said. Danger man: Pirlo, 35, was superb against England when they met in the Euro 2012 quarter-finals .

"By . Nick Pisa . Mafia boss Domenico Rancadore (pictured) targeted Father Gino Sacchetti because he encouraged residents to oppose the local mafia in Palermo . A brave anti Mafia priest has spoken of how he was targeted by an on-the-run Mob Godfather found hiding in a British suburb after 19 years. Former prison chaplin Father Gino Sacchetti was intimidated by members of the crime family run by Domenico Rancadore, 64, who was arrested in his flip flops at the home he shares with his wife and daughter. Fearless Fr Sacchetti, 75, stood up to the terrifying mobsters as they tried to shut him up in his campaign against the so called Costra Nostra 'men of honour' despite having a dead lamb nailed to his front door, his car firebombed and bullets sent to him in the post. A note sent with the bullets read: 'The first is for your heart, the second for your head, the third for the coup de grace. This is your final warning.' The softly spoken priest was based in the Mafia’s island heartland of Sicily for 20 years between 1986 and 2006 and spoke out against organised crime encouraging locals to turn their back on them and not be intimidated. Fr Sacchetti also angered mob bosses by refusing to sell up prime land which they wanted to use for a luxury development and were further outraged when he said he would instead open a shelter for drug addicts on the outskirts of Palermo - the heartland of Rancadore and his henchmen. Father-of-two Rancadore is said by Italian police to be the boss of the area around the suburbs of Caccamo and Trabia and their paths first crossed in the late 1980’s when the mobster was held in custody at the local prison where Fr Sacchetti was chaplain. Fr Sacchetti said: 'I knew Rancadore was involved in the threats against me - he sent two local brothers to threaten me. The brothers were arrested but Rancadore was already on the run. 'I suffered a series of threats and intimidation when I was a priest in Sicily. Fr Sacchetti was working as a prison chaplain in the cathedral city of Palermo in Sicily when his car was firebombed, had bullets posted to him and a dead lamb was nailed to his door . 'One period in particular was particularly bad - it was at the time I wanted to set up the shelter. 'My . car was firebombed and then I had the lamb nailed to my front door at . the church where I worked. Rancadore was said to be behind it. 'It was a horrific sight - something that is still clear in my memory, despite it being almost twenty years ago. 'There was a note pinned to it which read ""You will end up the same way"". It was a clear threat, they wanted to scare me but they were not going to put me off my work.' Fr Sacchetti, who now lives and works in Verona, was sent the bloodied lamb’s carcass at the same time as the late Pope John Paul II was visiting Sicily and had urged people to rebel against the Mafia. Mobsters had already murdered one campaigning priest Fr Giuseppe Puglisi, 56, who was gunned down by hit men in the run down Brancaccio area of Palermo in 1993 and the pope praised him for standing up to the gangsters. Fr Sacchetti said: 'Fr Puglisi was roughly the same age as me when he was murdered. Domenico Rancadore (pictured an artist's impression) was arrested in London after 19 years on the run . Mobsters had already murdered one campaigning priest Fr Giuseppe Puglisi, 56, who was gunned down by hit men in the run down Brancaccio area of Palermo in 1993 . 'The Mafia then turned its attention . on me because I would not back down to them. Rancadore back then was a . dangerous and powerful boss who controlled the area with fear. 'My . superiors in Palermo were very scared for my welfare but I said I would . not back down - as a result I was given a police escort around the . clock for ten years until I left Sicily in 2006. 'It was those officers with families looking after me who were brave. Years ago the Mafia had a rule that children, police and priests were untouchable but then back in the late 80’s and early 90’s things changed. 'The young son of an informer was dissolved in acid as punishment for him speaking out. Fr Puglisi was murdered and judges and police were targeted.' Fr Sacchetti added: 'Randacore was involved with very senior figures within the Mafia including Michele Greco who was in charge of Cosa Nostra at the time of the wars between rival clans. 'Rancadore used two brothers Salvatore . and Giovanni Colletti to threaten me with the lamb, the car bomb and . the bullets. They wanted me out but I was determined to stay and I did.' He added: 'I didn’t know . he had been arrested until you told me but I’m not surprised it has . taken so long to track him down. These people are very clever. 'Life on the run is horrible. You live in fear of being caught, looking over your shoulder all the time, dreading a knock on the door. It’s not a peaceful or serene life - it’s similar to the life I had under escort for ten years. 'One thing I will say though is that I have no anger or hatred towards Rancadore or the others that threatened me all those years ago. I have forgiven them and I bear no animosity towards them. 'My message would be to the young people, not to follow in the footsteps of their elders to a life of crime, they should not be afraid. The Devil has only one weapon, fear.

"By . Hannah Roberts . The first British victim of clerical sex abuse to meet Pope Francis has described the experience as ‘life-changing.’ Peter Saunders, 57, who was abused for more than five years by two priests, a teacher and a member of his family from the age of 8, said the visit to the Vatican was ‘very very emotional.’ Francis met six abuse victims including two Britons and two Irish people on Monday in a series of ‘intense’ discussions that lasted more than three hours during which he begged for forgiveness for the ‘sacrilegious’ crimes committed by the ‘sons and daughters of the church, who betrayed their mission.’ Peter Saunders, 57 (right), the first British victim of clerical sex abuse to meet Pope Francis has described the experience as ‘life-changing.’ Mr Saunders, who was abused for more than five years by two priests said the visit to the Vatican was ‘very very emotional' The Pope has previously been accused of not doing enough to tackle the abuse crisis. But he used the encounter to condemn clerical abuse of children in his strongest language yet saying it was ‘sacrilegious’ and caused him personally great pain. He said the church must ‘weep’ and make reparations for the betrayal of trust. Mr Saunders told the Boston Globe that by listening to him Francis had done more for him than anyone else. ‘He’s granted me something that the prime minister, and the deputy prime minister and all these other ministers of state in the UK never have. I had the benefit of a discussion with him, with no limits, …It was a life changing moment for me.’ Mr Saunders said he had been left with psychological scars and retained a life-long fear of clergy after years of abuse. He told the US newspaper: ‘ I’m wary of aspects of certain groups of people. Pope Francis, left, looks at an iPad with Claudio Maria Celli, centre, president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, on the day he met privately with a small group of victims of paedophile priests . 'When I see people in clerical dress, I step back and protect myself. I was very badly taken advantage of as a child and that’s engraved in my head.’ 'The church has been more interested in self-protection than in being transparent,' he said. When he was asked to meet Francis he couldn’t believe it, he said, because like many abuse victims, he grew up thinking he didn’t deserve anything good. He said: ‘I always feel that if something good happens to me, it comes with a price. One of my abusers told me as a child that I was never going to amount to anything...During the last few weeks I’ve been pinching myself, thinking, is this real? And it was, I met him.’ Despite his childhood Mr Saunders said he remains a devout Catholic and believes Francis to be sincere man. ‘The man I met today, I don’t think is a man who would let us down. He’s a different kind of pope. ‘ . He used the meeting to urge Francis to instruct his priests and bishops to work with civil authorities and told him he believed a sermon read in every church in the world condemning child abuse could bring people back to the fold.","Peter Saunders, 57, was abused for more than five years by two priests .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Football may be the national religion. But Italy has found itself in a spot of bother, after running an advert with Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue dressed in an Italian football shirt. The Catholic Church in Brazil says the use of the statue’s image is blasphemous and is threatening to sue for up to €7 million. The Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro said that 'exploiting the image of Christ the Redeemer is a crime'. But Italy has found itself in a spot of bother, after running an advert with Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue dressed in an Italian football shirt . The advertisement, which shows the figure, one of the world’s best known landmarks, dressed in the azure blue Italian shirt, was part of state broadcaster Rai's World Cup campaign. The two minute clip features a Capoeira dancer in the strip, and children, wearing the Italy kit, playing football in the street before ending with the image of the statue wearing the blue shirt with ‘Italia’ written on the back, alongside the slogan ‘Brazil awaits us’. The Catholic church in Rio di Janeiro, which owns the image rights for the statue, said it was 'disrespectful' and compared it to 'a Brazilian television channel making an advert in which mulatto girls engaged in indecent behaviour with the gladiators of the Colosseum.' Christ the Redeemer is one of the most famous religious statues in the world . Lawyer Alessandro Maria Tirelli, who notified Rai of the potential lawsuit, told Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano ''The archdiocese is outraged.' Edio Costantini, president of the Italian Sporting Center (CSI), a Vatican sports organisation, told the newspaper: 'We live in a world that has put God on the bench'. 'At a time when religious values seem to have become insignificant and everything is commercial it’s right to feel indignation.’ The advert has since been withdrawn by Rai. British bookies Ladbrokes have also produced an advert featuring the Christ Redeemer wearing a football jersey and today a hot air balloon in the likeness of the statute, wearing the colours of Australia's football team, floated over the Melbourne skyline in Australia today.

Fears for the health of Pope Francis have surfaced, after he cancelled two days of engagements. Following an intense working weekend, the 77-year-old decided not to hold Mass in Santa Marta this morning and cancelled his appointments for the rest of the day. He had already had advisors clear his schedule yesterday to rest, after hosting a diplomatically tricky prayer meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian presidents on Sunday. A few weeks ago he called off a visit to a Marian shrine near Rome ‘lighten his schedule’ before his three day trip to the Holy land. He has previously cancelled engagements because of a cold, or a light fever. The Vatican said:'Following a very historic and full weekend, the Holy Father has chosen to rest on Monday afternoon and today Tuesday.' His condition is 'not serious' the Holy See said. Vatican spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi said the two day absence was 'nothing to worry about.' The pope, who rises at 4.30am every day has kept up a whirlwind of activity since his election more than a year ago, but his advisers are hoping that he will take some time off this summer. Close collaborator Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras said: 'We have been asking him to have holidays this year.' 'Because last year he didn’t and sometimes he’s very tired.' 'So I think that during August he’s going to retire to rest.' He had already had advisors clear his schedule yesterday to rest, after hosting a diplomatically tricky prayer meeting with the Israeli and Palestinian presidents on Sunday . Traditionally popes moved to the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome during the summer months.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Babymother drama: Mario Balotelli arriving at court in Brescia, Italy, for a  custody hearing to determine how often he can care for his daughter Pia . With the selection for this summer's World Cup looming he doesn't need any extra pressure. But Mario Balotelli will have a lot on his mind after attending an Italian court where he is fighting a custody battle over his daughter. The Italian striker is in negotiations with his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico for the right to visit the child, called Pia, who is eighteen months old. Ballotelli did not acknowledge he was Pia’s father until February this year after DNA tests proved his paternity. He was allowed to hold her for the first time only a month ago in the court house in Naples, after the judge granted special permission. Balotelli and Miss Fico attended a private hearing at a court in Brescia, near Milan, to discuss how often the footballer will be able to visit his daughter. After a hearing that lasted about an hour the Serie A star’s lawyers said that they were confident he would have the chance to hold his daughter again before he leaves for the World Cup in Brazil. Balotelli’s lawyer Alessandra Capuano told Corriere della Sera:  ‘We are well on track to finding a way for both parents to fully collaborate.’ The judge did not go into discussions on maintenance payments, which are the subject of a separate legal process beginning in September. Balotelli, who has a turbulent on-off relationship with Belgian model Fanny Neguesha, shed his bad boy image for the court, dressed in muted tones, loafers, a white vest and shirt and sunglasses. He left the hearing yesterday with his lawyers and security, signing autographs as he went. Miss Fico, a former model, wore skinny jeans, a tight white T-shirt and leather jacket, and strode purposefully on towering heels. The pair have had an acrimonious . relationship since she fell pregnant in Manchester in 2012, with . Balotelli claiming she told the papers about the pregnancy before him. Miss .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Italy has threatened to send asylum-seekers across Europe without more help to stem the tide of arrivals from North Africa. The threat comes after the sinking of trawler carrying hundreds of migrants off the southern Italian coast which left at least 17 dead. Italian authorities have now detained two . Tunisians suspected of smuggling migrants aboard the boat having arrested them on suspicion of murder. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . The Italian Navy frigate 'Grecale', carrying the victims and the survivors of a shipwreck arrives at the Catania harbor, Sicily after a boat crowded with migrants sank  just beyond Libya's territorial waters . Migrants who landed aboard the Italian Navy vessel have been temporarily accommodated in the sports hall PalaCus Arcidiacono in Catania while police and mediators work on identification and reunification of families .

Italian intelligence says that another 800,000 would-be migrants are on the African coastline ready to set sail. Italy’s Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said that, without more help, with sea patrols, Italy would defy EU rules obliging migrants to stay in the country where they land and allow them to travel on to northern Europe. Two women and a young child wait in the temporary accommodation that has been set up for migrants involved in the disaster.

'Since migrants do not want to stay in Italy, they should have the opportunity to exercise their right of political asylum in the rest of Europe. Otherwise we transform Italy into the prison of political refugees.'

"By . Hannah Roberts . A wardrobe that held the body of Benito Mussolini for 11 years in an Italian monastery has gone on sale on eBay with a starting price of £3,000. The wardrobe itself is worthless but, having been the hiding place for the dictator’s corpse between 1946 and 1957, it has ghoulish value for collectors of fascist memorabilia. eBay specialists Lovendoperte, who bought the relic from a family in Lombardy, advertised the piece as a ‘unique fascist collectors' item’. Up for grabs: The wardrobe, right, which was the secret resting place of Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, left, for 11 years has gone up for sale on auction site eBay with a reserve price of £3,000 . Under the notes from the owner it says . it is an 'original and authenticated wardrobe that was the secret . hiding place of the remains of Benito Mussolini at the monastery of the . Cappuchin Brothers of Cerro Maggiore between 1946 and 1957.' They have yet to receive an offer. During . the last days of the war in Italy, Il Duce (the leader) - as Mussolini . was known - was captured by partisans who executed him by firing squad. His corpse was mutilated and strung up by the feet alongside that of his mistress, Clara Petacci, at an Esso station in Milan. The . Allies ordered the bodies to be placed in an unmarked grave north of . the city, to avoid the burial place becoming a place of pilgrimage. But . on Easter Sunday 1946, his body was exhumed by a group of fascists led . by Domenico Leccisi, who left a message on the grave: 'Finally, O Duce, . you are with us. We will cover you with roses, but the smell of your . virtue will overpower the smell of those roses.' Somehow during the venture, they lost one of the dictator’s legs. Executed: The bodies of Mussolini, centre, his mistress, Clara Petacci, right, and Achille Starace, secretary of the Fascist Party, hang by their heels in Milan after they were shot dead near the city by Italian partisans . Four months later the body was traced by the police, hidden in a small trunk at Franciscan monastery near Milan. To keep the whereabouts of the body secret from the public it was then taken to a Capuchin monastery, 15 miles northwest of Milan, and kept there in a cupboard. The monks held the remains for eleven years, before the authorities allowed the family to reinter the dictator’s body at Predappio, Mussolini's birthplace. Today, the town draws 100,000 pilgrims a year to the tomb.","Ghoulish relic is being advertised online as a 'unique fascist collectors' item'

"By . Hannah Roberts . A compulsive MI5 impersonator is facing a life sentence for the brutal murder of an Italian pensioner. Jason Marshall, 26, a council worker from Greenwich, south London, is accused of strangling the retired tour guide to death with an electric cable at his home in a suburb of Rome in February last year. The naked body of Vincenzo Iale, 68, was found face down in a pool of blood, in the bedroom of his home, in the seaside resort of Torvajanica, the court heard. The father-of-one had been stabbed dozens of times. Accused: Jason Marshall, 26, from Greenwich, London, is accused of strangling Vincenzo Iale, 68, to death with a cable in his seaside home near Rome after meeting him in a gay chat room . On arrest Marshall, who had met Mr Iale online, told Italian police he had diplomatic immunity, as an MI5 operative working at the British Embassy in Rome. The Briton had previously masqueraded as a secret services operative in London where he patrolled the Underground carrying out self appointed drug detection operations and issuing fines. He was handed an eight-month suspended sentence in 2010 after officials became suspicious of the ‘sniffer dog’, his pet Scottish terrier. Investigators say Mr Marshall, a former employee of Newham Council, tortured the pensioner to get his bank PIN code, after meeting him online in gay chatroom Badoo. The Londoner is charged with murder, as well as the theft of Mr Iale’s car and credit card, which he allegedly used to take out €2,000. Carabinieri officer Pippo Bisignani told the court: ‘The body was visible from the door, naked and face down with his hands behind his back. There was an electrical cord round his neck.’ Police marshall Luca Doganieri said: ‘Blood was splattered in the kitchen and bathroom and the body appeared to have been dragged along the corridor into the bedroom, leaving a red mark’. Marshall was held after a second man, hotel manager Umberto Gismondi, identified him as the person who, invited to his apartment via an online gay website, attacked him with pepper spray, beat him with a truncheon and attempted to suffocate him with a cushion. These were the items seized from the scene forming part of the case in Italy. On arrest, Marshall told Italian police he had diplomatic immunity because he was an MI5 agent . The attacker fled after neighbours heard the screams of the victim and called police – who then tracked down Marshall via his mobile phone. Gismondi said he asked Marshall why he was carrying a gun – which turned out to be a replica -- and was told he 'worked undercover for MI5 at the British Embassy in Rome'. During a dramatic outburst in court today, Marshall attempted to invoke European law, claiming that the British Ambassador had advised him that the slow progress of the Italian legal process was in breach of his human rights. As judges deliberated over the dates of the next hearings, Marshall, unshaven and dressed in a grey sweatshirt, shouted from a cage in the court: . 'It’s against European law,' he said. ‘What is wrong with this country? You promised me it would be over in one or two weeks. What is wrong with this country? Marshall, who is currently detained in a psychiatric hospital in Naples, faces a possible life sentence, his lawyer Francesco Bruschini told the Mail. He added: ‘However, he could be eligible for a reduction because he suffers from psychosis, delusions, Aspergers and borderline personality disorder.’ A court-commissioned psychiatrist’s report said that Marshall was ‘a danger to society’ and ‘needed round the clock health care.’","Jason Marshall, 26, accused of strangling Vincezo Iale, 68, to death .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Ulli Mair allegedly spent £54 on sex toys, for which she then attempted to claim reimbursement, on expenses . An Italian politician allegedly spent £54 on sex toys, for which she then attempted to claim reimbursement, on expenses. Regional councillor Ulli Mair, a member of the German-speaking right-wing separatist party, Die Freiheitlichen, submitted the receipt for a £20 vibrator and two other sex toys from a well-known adult chain, it is alleged. Miss Mair, who is a member of the Bolzano provincial council, in South Tyrol, an autonomous province on the border with Germany, claimed that she had bought the toys as a gift. She said: ‘We bought the present as a joke for a colleague’s birthday. He is a bit of a joker. So we decided to give him a birthday gift. It was a bit risqué, that’s all.’ Italy’s financial police began the investigation at the beginning of the year and were combing though documents when they came across the €64.92 receipt, Italian news agency ANSA reported. The investigation into politicians’ expenses is just one of several probes being carried out at Italy’s regional assemblies. In January this year, 83 politicians and aides in Sicily were put under formal investigation for spending on everything from designer underwear and Louis Vuitton bags to coffee capsules and comics. Miss Mair, who is a member of the Bolzano provincial council, in South Tyrol, an autonomous province on the border with Germany, claimed that she had bought the toys as a gift . Claims included a bill for espresso machine capsules which ran up to €5,000. Politicians also spent €179 of public money on a comic called Diabolik, according to reports. In October, the regional council of Emilia-Romagna in central Italy was put under investigation after local politicians allegedly spent public funds on everything from €500 pens to cheese and salami. One claimed 50 cents for a trip to a public toilet. In 2012, a member of Berlusconi’s party, Carlo De Romanis, allegedly blew £24,000 (€30,000) of taxpayers' money on a risque toga party. Pictures of the party, attended by around 2,000 people, have emerged showing guests dressed in tunics, wearing centurion helmets and pigs masks while drinking champagne and feeding each other grapes.","Regional councillor Ulli Mair is a member of the Die Freiheitlichen party .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Survivors of the Costa Concordia tragedy have told an Italian court how they realised they were being sent ‘into a trap’, after officials ordered them to return to their cabins as the cruise liner sank. As the first passengers to give evidence in the trial spoke today, Rosanna Abbinante from Bari said said she feared she ‘would die like a rat’ if she returned to her cabin. The cruise ship floundered after hitting rocks off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012, killing 32 people. Survivors of the Costa Concordia tragedy have told the Italian trial of Francesco Schettino how they realised they were being sent 'nto a trap', after officials ordered them to return to their cabins as the cruise liner sank . Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial in Grosseto, Tuscany, accused of causing the shipwreck by carrying out an ill-judged ‘salute’ to the island of Giglio. Mrs Abbinante, who was on the cruise with her husband, described scenes of mass panic and rage in the face of crew members who continued to insist that the accident was ‘merely a technical fault’. She said ‘The passengers were beating their fists on the tables of the restaurants. ‘One father with a baby was screaming. They told us that it was just a technical fault but we understood that this was not the case. ‘I wanted to return to my cabin to get my clothes but the ship was tipping. I decided not to go- I feared I would die like a rat.’ Another passenger Ivana Codoni said that she ignored advice by officials to stay calm and return to her cabin. Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial in Grosseto, Tuscany, accused of causing the shipwreck by carrying out an ill-judged 'salute' to the island of Giglio . Schettino is facing 20 year prison for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship . She told the court: ‘The personnel told us to go back to our cabins, but we realised that we were being sent into a trap.. and fled to the outer decks.’ Claudia Poliani, a hairdresser from Rome said that when the power failed after the collision, passengers were forced to take matters into their own hands, finding and putting on life jackets. She said: ‘Suddenly everything changed, from the happiness and excitement of being on the cruise, we passengers were struck by panic. It was dark, we fell over, no one helped us. ‘ Unable to communicate with crew who spoke neither Italian or English she said, ‘we found life jackets by ourselves and tried to put them on.’ The survivors said that two years after the crash, they still suffered from panic attacks and anxiety. Schettino is facing a 20 year prison for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship. The Concordia was raised from its rocky seabed last September and is expected to finally be towed away from Giglio in the autumn, and dismantled for scrap.","Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial in Grosseto, Tuscany .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Amanda Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound that killed Meredith Kercher, a court has ruled. High on drugs, she cut the British exchange student’s neck with a kitchen knife during a row over money, the court in Italy has said. Miss Kercher, 21, a Leeds University student, was found half-naked, her throat slit, in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. Scroll down for video . The appellate court in Florence has released papers saying that British student Meredith Kercher (left) argued with American roommate Amanda Knox (right) about money on the night Kercher was killed . The 337-page document adds that Kercher's wounds show she was held down and then stabbed, ruling out the possibility that there was only one attacker . Knox, . 26, and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, served four years for . the brutal murder before being exonerated on appeal in 2011. Then, . in a retrial earlier this year, the pair’s acquittal was overturned and . they were  sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively. A third man, . Ivory Coast national Rudy Guede is serving a 16-year  sentence for the . killing. The court in Florence has now published the reasons behind Knox and Sollecito’s reconviction. Prosecutors . had originally maintained the murder was the result of a sex game gone . wrong, but the judges dismissed this theory, saying an agreement to have . group sex ‘was not compatible with Meredith’s character’. Found guilty: Knox and Socellito served four years in prison before being acquitted and released. However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively . The killing, . they said, followed an argument between the two girls, which ‘exploded . into  violence’ with Knox under the influence of drugs. Statements by Guede, taken by police, said that Kercher had previously accused Knox of taking money from her room. Court papers conclude that Miss Kercher must have had 'multiple aggressors' and her death was not solely down to Rudy Guede (file pic) And . on the night of the murder these tensions came to a head when Amanda . let Rudy, an acquaintance who had a history of petty crime, into the . house, the judges said. ‘Because the accused were high and because of the level of tension between the girls, it exploded into violence.’ During . the attack it was Rudy who held Meredith back, while Amanda slit her . throat, the reasoning said. Sollecito also held a knife. ‘The . DNA on her wrists and inside Meredith lead us to say that Rudy during . the attack was not holding a knife but had his hands free which he used . to carry out sexual  violence and to help to immobilise the girl.’ Of . two knives used in the murder, the smaller one, which produced the . wound on the right side of the neck, was held by Rafaelle Sollecito, it . said. ‘The blade which . produced the wound on the left side of the neck, from which most of the . blood emerged and which caused the death of Meredith Kercher, was held . by Amanda Knox,’ the court report said. The . judgment reinstated two crucial pieces of DNA evidence discredited in . the original appeal court that let Knox and Sollecito walk free. The . amount of DNA on the alleged murder weapon, a kitchen knife seized from . Sollecito’s house which had traces of Miss Kercher on the blade, was . then disputed as too small. Papers say that Knox killed Miss Kercher, and was backed up by boyfriend Sollecito (pictured) And the court found DNA on Miss Kercher’s . bra strap belonging to Rafaelle Sollecito could have been the result of . contamination. But in the . latest judgment the court confirmed that the kitchen knife ‘had the . victim’s DNA on the blade… and was the same knife used by Amanda Marie . Knox to stab Meredith Kercher in the left side of the neck, in so . causing the only mortal wound’. The court accepted that Sollecito’s DNA . was on Meredith’s bra, leaving them ‘in no doubt that Amanda and . Rafaelle were in the house that night’. Italy’s . highest court must now confirm the conviction. Then Italy will attempt . to extradite Knox but their chances of success are minimal, diplomatic . sources say. The American said she will become ‘a fugitive’. After . she was freed in 2011, Knox immediately returned to her hometown of . Seattle to rebuild her life. She has found love with old friend James . Terrano and is now a creative writing student. Last year she released a prison memoir for which she was paid a reported £2.6million.

"By . Kate Lyons . Kim Teer was 17 when she went missing in Melbourne in 1979. She had been backpacking across the country . Kim Teer was on the trip of a lifetime backpacking around Australia when her mother last heard from her. Kim, who was weeks away from her 18th birthday, had written to her mother, Colleen Holding, asking her to send a copy of her birth certificate so she could get a driver's license. Colleen never heard from her daughter again. Colleen, now 73, still does not know what happened to her only child despite police investigations and two years spent travelling around Australia, visiting the places Kim had stayed in the hope someone might know something. Kim is one of thousands of people missing across the country as Australia marks Missing Person's Week this week. Kim's aunt Mary Hallam, 61, from the Southern Highlands of NSW said that 35 years after she went missing, the family believe that Kim is dead and police say they believe she met with foul play, but without a body, Kim's family have no answers and no finality. 'Unfortunately we all feel that Kim is no longer alive… But you can imagine, when you don't have the remains of someone, I know Colleen in her heart lives with the hope that she'll be found. That's something a parent never loses. When there's no body, there's no finality about it,' Ms Hallam told Daily Mail Australia. Kim, described by her aunt as an artistic girl, took off backpacking around Australia in 1978 at the age of 17. She returned to her aunt's home in Bathurst for Christmas in 1978, the last time her family saw her, before continuing her travels in 1979. After travelling across Western Australia, Queensland and NSW, she eventually stopped in Melbourne and shared a flat with two fellow travellers. 'Kim had an agreement with her mum that she would stay in constant contact to let her know she was okay, which she did, she sent letters to her mum and called her,' said Ms Hallam. Kim Teer is pictured as a teenager (left) and as police imagine she would look now (right). Police have reopened the investigation decades later, hoping they might be able to give Kim's family answers . When Kim's mother Colleen did not hear from Kim as her 18th birthday approached she became distressed and knew something was wrong. 'There's no way Kim would have not contacted her mother for her birthday,' said Ms Hallam. Colleen and her husband, Kim's step-father, drove to Melbourne to try and find her and then travelled across the country talking to people who might have known Kim. 'She just vanished off the face of the earth; [Colleen] never found any of her belongings. She spent two years going around Australia trying to find her,' said Ms Hallam. Kim's disappearance devastated both her parents, who had separated years earlier. Ms Hallam has not seen Kim's father Greg Teer for years, but is informed by his family that he is now 'very much a recluse… he can't quite cope with the fact that his daughter's gone.' Kim is pictured with her father Greg Teer (left) and with her father and mother Colleen Holding (right) Colleen, who worked as a cosmetics buyer for Myer, threw herself into work and hobbies in order to distract herself from the heartbreaking reality of Kim's disappearance. 'She worked really hard all her life and owns her own home, she did a lot of things to take her mind off it, retain her sanity. To mark Missing Persons Week this year, Australian Federal Police are attempting to raise awareness about the 35,000 people reported missing in Australia each year. Of those reported missing, approximately half are 'recidivists', such as teenagers who regularly run away from foster carers or other institutions, almost all of whom are found. Approximately 85 percent of all those reported missing in the country are found within 48 hours and police say it is crucial that people tell police as soon as they notice someone is missing. 'It is a myth that you have to wait 24 hours. We're always hearing on American TV that you don't call police or start searching [in the first 24 hours],' said Rebecca Kotz, from the Missing Person Unit with the Australian Federal Police. 'It couldn't be further from the truth. Police need to get onto it as soon as they can. In Australia we know for a fact the first 24 hours are so critical.' This year the focus of Missing Persons Week is on people with dementia, who comprise 10 percent of missing people reported in Australia. 'We have people who will wander off. They might be 200m from their front door, they might also fall into scrub and hit their head,' said Ms Kotz. Police are encouraging people with dementia to wear identity bracelets with a contact phone number and information about their condition, so that police can help them if they are found. 'She taught herself to sew and she'd make these amazing wedding dresses. She created some of the most beautiful things as a way of her dealing with the grief. It's a strange thing when something tragic happens in your life, certain people try to create something nice to balance it out.' Ms Hallam said that her sister could not face dealing with what happened, but as she got older it has caught up to her and she finds the uncertainty harder. '[Colleen] said: ""I envy people who can bury their children, because at least you know where they are, you know what happened to them,""' said Ms Hallam. Since retiring in 2009, Ms Hallam has dedicated herself to working with the NSW and Victorian police to trying to work out what happened to Kim. Police have re-opened the cold case and a reward of $100,000 for information leading to the apprehension and conviction of someone involved in Kim's disappearance, was announced in September last year in the hope of providing new leads into the case. Ms Hallam says she thinks there are a few suspicious people police should talk to . 'I've put several scenarios to the police, but as with an ongoing investigation they won’t comment,' she said. But for Kim's family, finding out what happened to her is less significant than recovering her body. 'Whether or not, anyone was ever found responsible, that'd be good because people do these things and get away with it, but to know where she is would be the best outcome of all. 'To have her remains found would be the best outcome ever, at least then we would know where she was, we could bury her properly… To be able to bury her remains would give you some sort of peace of mind, that's the wrong word, and I hate the word closure, because you never have closure on things like this, you think about it every waking minute of the day. It would give her some sort of ending to a long search.' Investigators would like to speak to anyone who has any information about Kim's disappearance or had any contact with her between August and October 1979.Anyone with any information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers 1800 333 000 or via the website at www.crimestoppers.com.au .","Kim Teer went missing at the age of 17 from Melbourne in 1979 .

"By . Hannah Roberts . A mass grave has been uncovered underneath Florence’s world famous Uffizi Gallery. In a discovery worthy of a Dan Brown novel, more than sixty skeletons have so far been unearthed, laid out head-to-toe, while archeologists believe that hundreds or thousands more may yet emerge. The grave, which is thought to date back to the fourth or fifth century, a dark period in Florentine history when the city was in decline, was only discovered when construction workers began digging a new lift-shaft for the museum. A mass grave has been uncovered underneath Florence's world famous Uffizi Gallery . The crypt of corpses sits below the library of the celebrated museum, home to masterpieces such as Leonardo's Da Vinci's Adoration of the Magi and visited by millions of Britons every year. Archeologists say the bodies bear no clear sign of malnutrition or violence, leading experts to believe they may have been victims of an early plague. Soil samples indicate that they were buried simultaneously in groups of four or five with the bones of children placed between adults. The manner of burial indicates a hasty interment showing a need to bury rapidly, each day, a large number of corpses, and need to optimise space during a fatal epidemic or plague when many more deaths were imminent. The notorious Black Death, which wiped out two thirds of the population of Florence, did not arrive until the 14th century. But the skeletons could reveal the existence of an earlier pandemic that was equally lethal, experts said. Archeology Superintendent for Tuscany Andrea Pessina said: ‘The remains which have been unearthed over the past five months bear no sign of trauma. 'We will conduct DNA and carbon-14 tests to determine the cause and time of death, as well as information on diet, pathologies, and work-related stresses at the time’. A statement from the Ministry for Cultural Assets read: ‘The excavations in the area of the Levante of the Uffizi have yielded an exceptional discovery: An instant picture of a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions which hit Florence in the early medieval period.’ The crypt of corpses sits below the library of the celebrated museum, home to masterpieces such as Leonardo's Da Vinci's Adoration of the Magi and visited by millions of Britons every year . ‘This catastrophe certainly contributed to the long period of decline in the city about which little is known, but perhaps this find alone will be enough to explain it.’ The theory of a massacre by a group of invading barbarians has been excluded because of the absence of traumatic wounds, the ministry said. Neither is there any sign of malnutrition. The most likely cause of death was a fatal and highly contagious epidemic such as plague, cholera, dysentery or flu. Tests to be carried out on the bones and teeth should reveal such a pandemic. The gallery are working with researchers from a specialist paleogenetic lab at the university of Mainz. The bones will be carbon dated and photographed before being reburied in another area of Florence.","The grave is thought to date back to the fourth or fifth century .

"By . Hannah Roberts . You might expect them to have be concerned for the welfare of another ancient collection of stones, famous the world over. But the Rolling Stones are at the centre of a row over a date in their forthcoming world tour which it is feared will do 'irreparable damage' to one of the glories of Ancient Rome - the Circus Maximus. The legendary British rockers - Mick Jagger, 70, Ronnie Wood, 66, Kieth Richards, 70, and Charlie Watts, 72 - are scheduled to perform on June 22 at the 2000 year old chariot racing stadium, immortalised in the film Ben Hur. Still rocking: But the Rolling Stones are at the centre of a row over a date in their forthcoming world tour which it is feared will do 'irreparable damage' to one of the glories of Ancient Rome - the Circus Maximus . Danger: The decision to bring 65,000 fans into a fragile archeological site (which has become a venue for rallies and concerts in recent decades) has led to outcry, with conservation experts warning of 'unpredictable consequences' But the decision to bring 65,000 fans into a fragile archeological site has led to outcry, with conservation experts warning of ‘unpredictable consequences’. The city’s culture tsar Maria Rosaria Barbera, who opposes the concert, wrote in a ministry document: ‘The choice of the Circus Maximus for the Rolling Stones concert brings a measure of risk for the heritage of the area that is not only heightened but also hard to predict.’ Citing the ‘irreparable damage' that had been inflicted on the 'particularly fragile area' in recent years by football fans, she said the Stones concert 'might provoke acts of vandalism and movement of people towards the emerging monuments.' Immortalised: The legendary British rockers are scheduled to perform on June 22 at the 2000-year-old chariot racing stadium, immortalised in the film Ben Hur . 'Unacceptable incumbrance': The 120 foot-wide stage and the four 50 ft lighting towers were 'an unacceptable incumbrance for an area of special merit', a local official said (pictured: Circus Maxims stadium in during Rome's 2005 Live 8 concert) The 120 foot-wide stage and the four 50 ft lighting towers were ‘an unacceptable incumbrance for an area of special merit ’, she added. Politicians have also waded into the debate. Centre right MP Luciano Ciochetti said: ‘As well as the archeological risks for the site there, the area all around the Circus Maximum will have to be closed for days with heavy consequences for traffic in a season that is already supporting the maximum number of tourists.’ But city mayor Ignazio Marino is hoping to use the concert a a springboard for an entire weekend of cultural events that will raise his profile and boost spending by tourists. Happy to be back: The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts, arrived in Perth, Australia, early on Monday morning and looked thrilled to be back . Heyday: The band's combined age now is 278 . Mr Marino, who said putting on a Stones concert had been his 'dream’ since being elected last year, wrote to an Italian newspaper: ‘The passionate chords of their rock in the archaeological heart of the city will be yet another demonstration of the great beauty of Rome.’ He said he hoped ‘to transform Circus Maximus into a landmark for major cultural events.’ And Mick Jagger tweeted in Italian: ‘I can't wait for the European tour to start. It's a very beautiful time of year to play.’ The Circus Maximus has been used for other pop concerts in the past with Genesis and Lady Gaga playing there in recent years. Bob Geldof's Live 8 concert was held there in 2005. But the site is currently under restoration. Archeologists have continued to discover Roman artefacts including ancient coins, wheels and saucepans as well as the remains of ancient taverns.","The band are scheduled to perform on June 22 at the chariot-race stadium .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Giant cruise ships are set to return to Venice’s historic waterways, just months after they were banned. A government decree that took effect in January had banned the eyesore of the behemoths passing through the canals because of the risk of damage to the ancient channels. But the administrative court of Venice accepted an appeal by lobbyists, including the city's port, and suspended the ban because of ‘the absence of any practical alternative navigation routes’. Ahoy there: Cunard liner MSC Musica glides through Venice . More than 600 cruise ships bearing 1.7million passengers passed in front of St Mark’s Church in 2012, a figure which grew seven per cent last year. Most were day trippers who barely contributed to the local economy. The judges ruled that there was ‘not sufficient preliminary research identifying risks connected to transits of ships over 40,000 tonnes in the canals in question'. The lifting of the ban immediately provoked outcry. Green Party spokesman Luana Zanella said the decision 'allows the transit of real and actual floating skyscrapers exposing a city unique to the world to extremely high risk'. Water sight: The view of Venice for cruise ship passengers is brilliant but some complain that they contribute little to the local economy as they often stay on board while docked (pictured is the MSC Opera) Hull of a controversy: The huge ships, sometimes ten storeys high, erode the waterways and the city¿s fragile foundations (pictured is the Seabourn Odyssey) She added: ‘We demand the intermediate intervention of the government with a law to limit the access of cruise ships into the lagoon. To save Venice is to save the heritage of all Italians.' Environment minister Gian Luca Galletti said that he believed it was ‘still possible to find a solution as soon as possible to avoid the continual presence of big ships in the ancient canals of Venice.’ Venice’s proud residents have long been up in arms about the presence of large cruise ships passing through the canals . The huge ships, sometimes ten storeys high, erode the waterways and the city’s fragile foundations, contribute to the worsening flooding that occurs every winter and damage the delicate eco-systems of the lagoon. The cruise companies pay huge port fees for the privilege, but their passengers frequently eat and sleep on board and contribute little direct revenue to restaurants and hotels. Venice’s mayor Giorgio Orsoni wants to see cruise tourists dock at Porto Marghera, a town in the province of Venice long blighted by industrial pollution. Other suggestions have included a floating off-shore port. Alternative solutions would see the number of cruise ships allowed to enter the lagoon severely limited, or the dredging of a new approach to the same cruise passenger terminals but avoiding the narrow canals around St Marks Square. Tensions were raised last summer after the Carnival Sunshine, which is owned by the same parent company as the notorious Costa Concordia, allegedly passed within yards of the city’s bank while performing ‘a sail by salute’ to a major company shareholder. Film footage appeared to show the 110,000-ton liner squeezing a vaporetto water taxi and other boats between the ship and the bank. Carnival denied any wrongdoing. The ban on large cruise liners was accompanied by a crackdown on water traffic, after the death of a German tourist last year. Joachim Vogel, 50, a professor of criminal law, was crushed against a dock by a reversing vaporetto water bus, as he took a tour with his family by gondola near the Rialto Bridge. The tragic accident prompted authorities to bring in a series of new safety regulations including breathalyser tests for gondoliers and ‘a floating congestion zone’ on the Grand Canal to ease the chaotic rush hour traffic.","Decree in January banned huge ships from entering Venice's canals .

"By . Kate Lyons . Te Kapua Reremoana Hemopo is being sought by police. He has been convicted of causing unnecessary harm to an animal . A man is being hunted by police for beating his dog so severely it required its leg to be amputated in an attack described by the RSPCA as demonstrating 'wanton cruelty' and 'systematic abuse'. ‘This is the higher end of cruelty,’ RSPCA Chief Inspector Amanda Swift told Daily Mail Australia. Te Kapua Reremoana Hemopo, 25, from Parmelia in Perth is being sought by police for cruelty to his 18-month-old Staffordshire terrier, Bobbi. Hemopo was found guilty of causing unnecessary harm to an animal and could receive up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $50,000. In March this year, Hemopo repeatedly kicked Bobbi 'hard like a soccer kick', according to one witness, in the backyard of his house. He washed the blood from Bobbi's face when witnesses intervened, only to continue to kick her repeatedly afterwards. The beating was so severe that Bobbi sustained extensive fractures to the skull, a fractured jaw, shoulder and leg, as well as broken ribs that pierced her lungs. 'This is a stocky dog. They’re know for being a hardy breed, in order to inflict the injuries it had, it takes a level of force,' said Ms Swift. Bobbi required eight days of intensive veterinary treatment and her leg, which was irreparably damaged, had to be amputated. A veterinary report suggested that Bobbi had been beaten before and was injured and unable to bear weight on her rear legs at the time of the March beating. Bobbi was injured so severely by the beating from her owner that her rear leg had to be amputated . A CT scan of Bobbi's face shows the enormous damage that was done to her, requiring eight days of intensive veterinary work . 'The lack of compassion is the one thing that really got to me,' said Ms Swift. 'To beat an animal that’s already injured. What could a puppy do to warrant that?' Bobbi has now been placed in another home. Though Hemopo was found guilty in his absence, because of the serious nature of the offence the magistrate wanted him to attend court in person to receive his sentence. A warrant has been issued for Hemopo's arrest and his partner Vanessa Masoomian, 22, was convicted for failing to take steps to alleviate harm and failing to take the dog to a vet for treatment. She was issued with a $5,000 fine and is banned from owning a pet for 10 years. Anyone with information about Hemopo's whereabouts is urged to contact WA Police immediately on 131 444. Gigi the Chihuahua was kicked so hard that she flew across a room, the injuries she suffered were so severe they killed her . The search for Hemopo comes as another Perth man received a $15,000 fine and was banned from owning a pet for 10 years after he kicked a Chihuahua so hard it died. Stanley Robinson Clarke, 31, from Hamilton Hill in Perth admitted he kicked the pet dog, named Gigi, so hard that she flew across the room and hit a door on March 17. Clarke had been drinking at a bar when he got into an argument with his housemate and came home. When Clarke returned to his house, Gigi, who was staying at the property temporarily ran up to greet him and Clarke then kicked her across the room. Gigi sustained a fractured skull and head trauma and though she was taken to the vet her condition deteriorated and she was then put down. Ms Swift said that while kicking a dog was never acceptable, Clarke had committed the act without premeditation and had since shown a lot of remorse, . 'He accepted his guilt... It was an instantaneous, not premeditated, spur of the moment, stupid thing to do,' she said.","Te Kapua Reremoana Hemopo has been convicted of causing unnecessary harm to his dog Bobbi .

"By . Kate Lyons . Australia will see the largest overhaul of national security laws in a decade, as laws are rolled that could allow Australian police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries, disrupt suspect computer networks and suspend people’s passports. The first in a raft of changes to national security legislation will be presented to parliament on July 14 and they will continue to be announced over coming months. These will be the most significant changes to security laws in Australia since the anti-terrorism laws introduced by John Howard in 2005. Scroll down for video . Attorney General George Brandis will roll out the most dramatic changes to Australian security laws in more than a decade . The first set of reforms, to be put before parliament in a fortnight, will allow ASIO to use third-party computers under warrant and to extend ASIO’s power to target and disrupt computer networks that suspected of use by terrorists, reported The Australian. Changes to laws regarding the collection of foreign evidence could allow the Australian Federal Police to conduct surveillance operations in foreign countries and tender the evidence in Australian courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases. The law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war, like Syria, or ‘failed states’ like Somalia. The laws draw from government reports released over the past 18 months and recommendations from the outgoing National Security Legislation Monitor Bret Walker. The laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against Australians who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), pictured marching in Syria . Musa Cerantonio, who is considered to be one of the most influential jihadist preachers in support of ISIS, has announced he is travelling to Syria . Other changes main include the power to suspend people’s passports, in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice, and allowing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to pass on intelligence about Australians to its domestic counterpart, ASIO, under certain circumstances. These changes would assist with the investigation and prosecution of Australians who travel abroad to engage in foreign conflicts, such as in Syria and Iraq. The changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism. The announcement comes as another Australian announced he would be going to Syria to join with his 'brothers' in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). The Australian Muslim convert who boasts about being the third most 'liked' extremist preacher on Facebook, announced on social media that he would be joining the jihad.","New security laws will be start being rolled out in a fortnight .

Majak Daw, 23, who plays for the North Melbourne Kangaroos, has been issued with a charges summons in relation to a sexual assault in Altona North in 2007. Police confirmed that detectives from the Sex Crime Squad detectives charged a 23-year-old from Wyndham Vale with three counts of rape yesterday. Majak Daw has been charged with three counts of rape in relation to an incident that allegedly occurred in 2007 . 'The charges relate to a historical sexual assault in Altona North in 2007,' a Victoria Police spokesperson told MailOnline. 'As the matter is before the court, it would be inappropriate to comment further.' The North Melbourne Football Club released a statement confirming Majak Daw had been charged by Victoria Police in relation to the alleged crime. 'The club respects the integrity of the legal process and asks the right to privacy of all involved be respected,' the statement said. 'North Melbourne will support Majak and he will remain available for selection at VFL and AFL level.' Police confirmed that the offences related to an incident in Altona North in 2007, when Daw was 16 . AFL general counsel Andrew Dillon said the league would not bar Daw from playing, but would restrict his public appearances. 'Given the specific circumstances of the case, the AFL has determined that the player remains available for selection by his club,' Mr Dillon said. 'However, we will monitor the case and reserve the right to take action under our rules if deemed appropriate. 'Further, the AFL has determined that a restriction will be placed on the player's AFL and club promotional and development duties.' Daw's management group Elite Sports Properties said he would not be commenting on the charges. 'He is entitled to a presumption of innocence and we would ask that this and the right to privacy of all involved be respected,' the group said in a statement. A filing hearing is scheduled for July 11. Daw made international headlines when he was drafted to the North Melbourne Football Club in 2009. He was born in Khartoum in Sudan and fled to Australia as a refugee. He is the first Sudanese-Australian footballer to be drafted to an AFL club.

"By . Kate Lyons . None of the 157 Tamil asylum seekers who've been detained at sea for four weeks will ever call Australia home, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said. This is part of a new asylum-seeker deal where about two-thirds of the 157 passengers could be sent back to India. Mr Morrison vowed the passengers who do not return to their country of origin would be sent to Nauru or Manus Island, The Daily Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video . Scott Morrison has confirmed that a border protection vessel holding 157 asylum seekers will be brought to Australia . The Australian vessel carrying the asylum seekers is on its way to Australian shores, making it the first asylum seeker vessel to land in Australia since the government introduced its hardline Stop The Boats campaign. Mr Morrison confirmed on Friday that the vessel would be brought to Australia so that the identify and origin of passengers could be determined. He said the decision to allow the vessel to land did not reflect any change in the government's policy and that there had been 'no broken promise'. 'It is the policy of the government and of Operation Sovereign Border not to resettle people in Australia. 'There is no change to our policy in anyway, there is no change to our resolve.' He said that bringing the asylum seekers to Australia was simply the 'most effective, safest, and most convenient method' of dealing with those on board the vessel. When asked whether this decision marked a failure of the government's 'stop the boats' promise before the September 2013 election, he stated that he had never promised that the boats would stop entirely, but that they would reduce the number of boats arriving to the levels experienced during the Howard government. It is believed the boat left Pondicherry in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu on June 11 and was intercepted by Australian border patrol on 29 June. It is believed the asylum seekers will be taken to Curtin Detention Centre in Western Australia . Those on board the vessel include 37 children, it is not clear what condition they have been kept in while detained, though Guardian Australia has reported they have been locked for 21 hours a day in windowless rooms, sleeping in bunks stacked four high. A High Court case is trying to establish whether the detention of the asylum seekers on board the vessel, is legal under the Maritime Powers Act. Mr Morrison said that once the asylum seekers arrive in Australia, Indian officials will be granted consular access, and the Indian government has agreed to accept Indian citizens and some Sri Lankan nationals back into the country. The minister would not confirm what would happen to any asylum seekers on board the vessel who were not found to be Indian or Sri Lankan nationals, but stated categorically that 'they will not be resettled [in Australia].' Mr Morrison would not confirm the destination of the border protection vessel, but Guardian Australia reported it is currently on its way to the Australian territory of the Cocos Islands, off the north-west coast of Australia. Government sources interviewed by the Guardian said that asylum seekers will land on the Cocos Islands on Saturday before being taken to Curtin detention centre in Western Australia.","Boat carrying 157 asylum seekers, including 37 children, has been detained at sea for almost a month .

"By . Kate Lyons . Two 16-year-old asylum seekers living in Adelaide were taken from their carer without warning or explanation and have been moved to a detention centre in Darwin, causing outrage in the boys' community and school. The boys, who cannot be named, came to Australia from Vietnam in 2011 and after some time in Inverbrackie Detention Centre were released into community detention in Adelaide where they attended school and joined a local soccer team. The boys were taken on Thursday June 26 after school while they were at their carer's home playing Xbox. 'There was a knock at the door and four people were at the door – two federal police and two immigration officers,' said Meredith Edwards, the principal of Woodville High School, which the boys attended. She has been in contact with one of the boys via phone calls over the last month. Meredith Edwards (left) is the principal of Woodville High School, which the boys attended. Kyle Rigney (right) a student at the school started a Change.org petition calling for the boys to be returned to Adelaide . The boys were handed letters dated the same day, one of which has been provided to Daily Mail Australia. 'The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [Scott Morrison] has made a decision that your residence determination is no longer in the public interest,' the letter reads. 'As such the the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection has exercised his public interest power... to revoke your residence determination.' Ms Edwards said the boys had not broken any of the conditions of their community detention, which require them to attend school, abide by the law and not to make public comments and were given no reasons as to why their residence had been revoked. She described the boys as 'highly academic and focused on success,' and said they would make 'incredibly loyal citizens'. When they received the letter, Ms Edwards said the boys were distressed and asked what they had done wrong, to which one of the officers replied: 'You haven't done anything wrong, this is just what the minister wants.' 'That's the most distressing thing, they don't understand what they've done. A lot of them thought when they were placed in community detention, that meant they were worthy of getting a protection visa,' said Ms Edwards. Students at Woodville High School have begun a campaign to bring back their friends from the detention centre in Darwin . The letter presented to one of the boys informing him he was required to go to a detention centre in Darwin . The boys were told to pack their bags and were then taken to Inverbrackie detention centre in separate cars. Ms Edwards said the next morning they were woken at 3am and flown to Darwin on separate planes, each accompanied by four security guards. 'They're slightly built 16-year-old asylum-seekers,' said Ms Edwards. 'Each slightly built 16-year-old boy had four Serco guards circling them so they couldn't run… they were so confused.' Ms Edwards said the school received no official notification of the boys' removal. Brad Chilcott, National Director of Welcome to Australia, a not-for-profit that works with asylum seekers, says the way in which the boys' removal had been conducted encouraged 'distrust, fear and suspicion'. 'You can't say that it's in the best interest of these kids to move them at 3 o'clock in the morning surrounded by four guards in two separate planes,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just imagine my kids in the same scenario and how I would want them to be treated. It's not in a way that increases or even revisits the trauma they've experienced in their home country or increases their distrust of authority, but in a way that upholds their dignity.' A student at the high school started a petition encouraging Scott Morrison to allow the two teenagers to return to their Adelaide community. At time of writing it had 8,584 signatures . The Department for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail Australia that it was following 'standard operating procedures' which had 'been in place under successive governments for some years'. 'The Minister may choose to return a community detainee to an immigration detention facility for a range of reasons including progressing status resolution, a breach of the conditions of their community detention, or where he considers it to be in the public interest,' a spokesperson for Mr Morrison told Daily Mail Australia. The boys are now being held at Wickham Point Alternative Place of Detention in Darwin from where they fear they will be deported back to Vietnam. Students at Woodside High School have rallied behind their fellow students and have begun petitioning their local State MP, Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, to release them from held detention. An online petition, Bring Our Boys Back Home, started by a Woodside High School student has garnered more than 8,000 signatures. The students also have a Facebook page and are using the hashtag #twotoomany. They have also planned a rally on the Adelaide Town Hall steps on August 2nd.","Two asylum seekers, both 16, were removed from their homes in the night .

"By . Kate Lyons . Tobacco companies have seen a dramatic profit increase in the last year despite the introduction of plain packaging legislation. The profits of three major Australian tobacco companies increased by 30 percent last year due to cigarette manufacturers raising prices before anti-smoking rules were introduced. According to data obtained by The Australian Financial Review, profits for Australia’s three major tobacco companies have more than doubled to $2.2 billion over the last five years. Scroll down for video . Profits for major Australian tobacco companies have increased since plain packaging laws were introduced due to companies driving up the prices of cigarettes . These record profits are despite the grim predictions of the tobacco industry about the effect the plain packaging laws would have on their business. While tobacco excise duty increased 24 cents per pack of 25 cigarettes, between August 2011 and February 2013,  tobacco companies increased their prices and increased their revenue. The three major companies – British American Tobacco Australasia, Philip Morris Australia and Imperial Tobacco Australia – normally increase their prices above the rate of excise increases, but prices jumped significantly in mid-2011 when the federal government indicated it would introduce plain packaging laws. Data compiled by Cancer Council Victoria shows that the average price of one cigarette increased by 34 cents from 43.9 cents in 2008 to 78.2 cents in 2014. A pack of Winfield 25s went from $16.55 in August 2011 to $18.75 in February 2013. Of this $2.20 difference, the Australian Financial Review reported that 44 cents was excise and GST and the remaining $1.56 was profit for the company. The increased profits are despite Treasury data released late in June that showed cigarette sales have dropped since plain packaging became mandatory in December 2012, with 3.4 percent fewer cigarettes sold in 2013 compared to 2012. These profit increases are despite the grim predictions of the tobacco industry about the effect the plain packaging laws would have on their business .","Profits of Australian tobacco companies increased by 30 percent last year .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Aap . Tony Abbott is less popular than Julia Gillard was in the days before she was dumped in favour of Kevin Rudd before last year's election. The latest Newspoll, published by The Australian, shows that Mr Abbott's approval rating has dropped to 31 percent, lower than Ms Gillard's 34 percent approval rating last June. Voters also reported the highest level of dissatisfaction with Mr Abbott since he was elected prime minister, with 62 percent dissatisfied with his performance. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott's approval rating is currently at 31 percent, lower than Julia Gillard's 34 percent approval rating in the days before she was ousted as leader last year . Bill Shorten has a ten-point lead on Tony Abbott as preferred prime minister, with 44 percent of voters saying he would be a better PM . Bill Shorten had a 10-point lead on Tony Abbott as preferred prime ministerm with 44 percent  saying they would rather the Labor leader was in charge, compared to only 34 percent preferring Mr Abbott. The poll also showed that if the election were held today Labor would win, with the ALP scoring 55 percent of the two-party-preferred vote, compared to 45 percent for the Coalition. This is the fifth consecutive Newspoll that has put Labor ahead on the two-party-preferred vote, it is the same low result the Coalition scored in the first poll after the May budget. and the equal worst result for the Coalition in four years. Do you think Tony Abbott is doing a good job as prime minister? These results are almost a complete reverse of the election results from last September, when the Coalition received 53.5 percent of the two-party-preferred vote. Bill Shorten has regained the 10-point lead as preferred prime minister that he had in the first poll after the budget was announced. However his satisfaction rating, while unchanged at 34 percent since last month's poll, is down from his post-budget high of 42 percent. Dissatisfaction with Shorten dropped four points from the poll last month and is now sitting at 41 percent, more than 20 points lower than Abbott's dissatisfaction rate of 62 percent. Preference for the Greens and other independent parties increased significantly from the election last year, with 13 percent of people saying they would vote Greens and 15 percent saying they would vote for independent parties if the election were held today, compared to 8.7 percent and 12.4 percent at September's election respectively.","Tony Abbott's approval rating has dropped to 31 percent, lower than Julia Gillard's 34 percent approval rating before she was dumped last year .

A Mexican metro driver has been caught on video playing Farmville on his tablet computer while at the controls of a train . Passenger Carlo Segura Linares took the video on his mobile phone, which shows the train driver at the controls of the vehicle at the same time as playing the game . Mr Linares said: 'I couldn't believe it when I got onto the train and saw this guy that was supposed to be driving playing Farmville on his tablet. 'I grabbed my phone straightaway because I knew no one would believe me, and I wanted to make sure everybody realised how we were putting lives at risk with idiots like this.' In a message alongside the video posted online, Mr Linares wrote: 'Look at this, this is our security, this is our safety in the hands of this idiot who feels he would rather play Farmville.

Mr Linares said he was most shocked when the driver appeared to shut the doors only to open them again a short while later, which allowed him to continue playing the game uninterrupted for a few more seconds. The driver has now been suspended after the video was widely shared on social media. The company issued a statement on its website which read: 'With regards to the video currently circulating on social media networks showing a driver at work, we can confirm that proceedings have been started and he is currently suspended.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . The elixir of dermatological youth has now arrived on earth - in London's Mayfair, to be more precise - and its makers claim it can banish wrinkles in just 12 minutes. What's more, after around ten sessions, the effects will last for years. That's according to Spa Illuminata, which is now offering a new radio frequency treatment called Efficy, made by skincare specialists Germaine de Capuccini. On the face, the treatment can be used to repair deep lines and wrinkles, reduce double chins or attack lines and puffiness round the eyes. Efficy in action: The cutting-edge treatment uses a single electrode . It can also reduce fat, cellulite and fluid retention and increase smoothing and tightening on the body. The cutting-edge non-invasive equipment incorporates three technologies in one treatment. Digital monopolar radio-frequency creates heat which stimulates the production of connective tissue in the dermis (the thick layer of living tissue below the top thin layer of skin); vacuum push-pull technology creates lymphatic drainage and digital transdermal introduction targets specific layers of the skin. Unlike most radio frequency treatments, which use bi-polar or tri-polar technology, the Efficy machine uses digital mono-polar technology, which means there's only one electrode. What's the advantage? 'There is no unnecessary flow of current through the body,' explains Gina Baker at Germaine de Capuccini. 'Efficy creates . retraction of collagen fibres, which produces a flash smoothing effect on . the skin’s surface giving instant results.' Before: Visible lines appear on the forehead . After: 12 minutes later the head is smoother . 'It also provides . activation of the heat shock proteins restoring the balance of the . dermis, stimulating the production of new supporting connective tissue and . reorganising the dermal structure, making it thicker and reducing . wrinkles,' she says. 'The treatment increases the production of . elastin, hyaluronic acid and collagen too, which strengthen the . dermis. 'By producing greater blood flow, Efficy nourishes and oxygenates the dermis, . while increasing liquid and toxin drainage,' she adds. The drainage specifically helps with the treatment of double chins and puffiness . in the eye contour. The new treatment combines three technologies in one . For the body, the machine works . by fluidifying fat. 'The fatty tissue presents great resistance to the . flow of current, increasing lipolysis [fat breakdown],' Gina explains. They claim results . are seen from the very first session - in as little as 12 minutes. To create a long-lasting effect, approximately five to 15 sessions are recommended  for the . face and between 10 and 20 for the body, depending on the condition treated. Dermotologist Dr Ravi Jain explains, 'Radio frequency is great for people who don't want needles and don't want downtime, but it's not a panacea for everyone. 'If there's already sun damage or loss of elasticity it's unlikely to be as effective. It's usually used more as a prevention that a correction. Commenting on the 12-minute claim Dr Jain says, 'All radio frequency treatment tends to give people that healthy glow straight away, but the real measure of how effective it is is how they look a month down the line.' Alla Higgs, treatment manager at Spa Illuminata says, ‘Despite working deep into the skin, the treatment is not painful so patients can still feel relaxed.' Following an in-depth consultation the therapist uses a programme tailored to suit individual needs.","Germaine de Capuccini has launched Efficy, a new non-evasive treatment .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Two-year-old Lilly squeezes her mother tight and begs her to tell Fireman Sam to stop his siren. Sadly though, the deafening noise is out of her mum’s control. It’s 11pm and Lilly is cowering with her parents and little sister in the stairwell of her apartment building in Tel Aviv, as Hamas rockets fly overhead. The bellowing sirens wailing outside are the warning that Tel Aviv is under attack. ‘I realise now that having grown up in Manchester and spent most of my adult years in London I’d never experienced real fear before - not until I first heard that siren,’ says 35-year-old Micky Stemmer, mum to Lilly and 1-year-old Talia. ‘The worst part is knowing your children are in danger and being helpless to protect them.’ When the sirens start, Micky and the other residents of Tel Aviv have 90 seconds before the bombs reach them from Gaza. ‘All I can think about is getting my girls to as protected a place as possible,' she says, which for Micky is the inner stairwell of her apartment block. 'I feel total panic inside but I try to put on a calm face. I don’t want them to sense my fear - at least that I can try to control,’ she says. Scroll down for video . Left: Micky in happier times with daughters Talia (left) and Lilly; Right: Children at a nursery in Tel Aviv crouch down during a siren which warns that bombs are heading towards them . Micky had always dreamed of living abroad, so when she married Swiss-born Ilan fours years ago, the couple decided to settle in New York. ‘Once we had kids, living in Manhattan became unfeasible, so we looked to move on. We thought about moving back to the UK but then Ilan, who's a lawyer in hi-tech, was offered a job in Israel. 'Of course I had my reservations - I knew there was a fragile state of peace in Israel - but I loved the atmosphere, the climate and the vibrancy of Tel Aviv, so we decided to make the move. ‘Within a week of being here in November 2012, Hamas fired rockets into Sderot, a town in the South of Israel. I was glad it hadn’t made the news in the UK because friends and family might have questioned our decision - and I didn’t want anything to ruin our new life. 'We’d started to make friends and I loved the laid back lifestyle. At the time, there hadn’t been a rocket attack on Tel Aviv for 21 years and the general consensus amongst the Israelis was that Tel Aviv was out of range, so I didn’t feel we were in danger.’ What Micky hadn’t taken into account was that only 40 miles away from Tel Aviv, the Gaza strip, given to Palestinians in 2005, was now under Hamas rule. ‘I remember watching the Israelis withdraw from Gaza on the BBC from my flat in Colindale and thinking it was a step towards peace in the region. I never imagined in my wildest dreams how negatively that news snippet would end up impacting my life and that years later that strip of land would become a launch pad for firing rockets at me and my family.’ The trail of smoke from Gazan rockets heading towards Micky's hometown of Tel Aviv . So how does a British girl feel about the Israeli government’s retaliation? ‘What I realise living here is how targeted Israel tries to be with its response - they drop leaflets and phone ahead so civilians can evacuate before they strike terrorist targets. But by using their people as human shields and hiding rocket launchers and weapons in civilian houses and schools, the jihadist regime doesn't make it easy to avoid fatalities. But there's sadness here when there are fatalities on either side. No one wants blood shed.' The hardest part of the ordeal for Micky is dropping her girls at nursery each morning, not knowing what the day holds. 'There are ten children in Lilly’s class but it takes them four minutes to get to the basement where the bomb shelter is, so they huddle in a corner of the classroom as far away from the windows as possible. ‘Some parents have stopped taking their kids to nursery but we both work so we don’t have that luxury. One morning last week, the day after the nursery in the South of Israel had been hit by a rocket, Lilly noticed me getting teary as I kissed her goodbye. She said, ‘Don’t worry mummy, you’ll pick me up soon’, which is exactly what I usually say to her, but in reverse. I felt like my heart was going to burst.’ ‘At nursery they’ve told Lilly that the . siren is Fireman Sam playing a game, so I’ve tried to keep up the . pretense. But when she’s snatched from her bed in the middle of the . night and sees people screaming and running for shelter during the day, . even a two-year old is wise enough to know something frightening is . happening,’ says Micky. Happier times: Rachel with her three children (from top left) Oli, Maya and Daniella before Tel Aviv was under attack . When Micky and her family huddle on the stairwell they wait to hear ‘the boom’. ‘The noise scares the girls but it signals relief,’ she says. The boom she’s referring to is the reverberation of the rockets being intercepted by the Iron Dome – new Israeli anti-missile technology. Since the attacks began two weeks ago, the Iron Dome has managed to destroy the vast majority of the 1,600 Hamas rockets launched on Israel, preventing them from causing the desired death and devastation on the ground. 'Without the Iron Dome Hamas would have killed tens of thousands of Israeli civilians dead by now,' says Micky. So will Micky give up on her dream lifestyle and move back home? ‘Leaving two jobs, nurseries and friends isn’t so straight forward,’ she says. ‘And in some ways I feel more at home here than ever. They say the worst of times bring out the best in human nature – and in my experience that’s certainly been true. ‘The other day when a siren went off I got stuck in the door of the supermarket with my double buggy and with only a few seconds left people were putting themselves in danger to help me get the girls out. Relative strangers have offered for us to move into their house so that we can be nearer to a proper bomb shelter at night. And if you walk down the street, front doors are left unlocked so passers by can shelter in the event of a missile attack. Rachel's three children (left to right) Oli, Daniella and Maya, on arrival in Israel, unaware of the trauma that lay ahead . ‘It would also be hard to leave the friends we’ve lived through this trauma with because only they really understand what we’ve been through,' Micky adds. Once such friend is fellow expat Rachel Gerstler from London. The mum-of-three left the UK for Shanghai eight years ago then relocated to Israel in 2012. ‘My brother moved to Israel from London and made a great life for himself here, so we decided to try it out instead of going back to London,’ says Rachel, mum to Oli, 10, Maya, 4 and Daniella, who turned three last week. ‘The first night the sirens went off I was out at friends and had left a babysitter at home with the kids. No one was expecting it.’ ‘I’d just stepped out the door of their block and instead of going back in I started running to my car to get home to my kids, which was obviously impossible within 90 seconds. But in the panic that’s all I could think to do. I was throwing up as I ran and was retching the whole way home. ‘I drove along the deserted streets, knowing that if these rockets weren’t intercepted I’d be finished. I didn’t even know what a bomb sounded like so when I heard a boom overhead I didn't know if it was the noise of the rocket about to land, an explosion or an interception. 'I just kept going as fast as I could until I was back through the door with my children. They were asleep when I came in and the babysitter helped me carry them onto the floor of the bomb shelter in the basement. ‘Since then we’ve been sleeping in shelter every night. I can’t risk getting three kids to safety in 90 seconds on my own,' she says, but adds she feels lucky she's not in Southern Israel where they only have 15. 'The children have obviously been very traumatised and confused,' says Rachel, so after ten days of shelling, she and six other mums decided . to brave an outing to a nearby swimming pool with their kids. ‘Suddenly the sirens went off and the kids in the . pool started panicking and scrambling to get out,' she says. 'Parents were . screaming, desperate to find their children, and . kids were crying in a frenzy to get inside before the bombs were . overhead. It was like a scene out of a disaster movie,’ she says. 'I never imagined this is where my journey would end up.' Let's hope this disaster movie soon has a peaceful ending.'","Micky Stemmer, 35, from Manchester moved to New York before relocating to Israel for her husband's work .

The sisters were born premature in April at just 28 weeks and spent seven weeks in hospital, but are now home with their parents Jessica and Liam Posselwhite from Guisborough, North Yorkshire.

But the Guisborough trio are all thriving and become the fifth generation of their family, welcomed by great great grandmother Mabel Gildroy, 96. Proud mum Jessica, 25, a youth support worker, said, 'It was overwhelming at first, when we found out. The initial scans were not very good and we were warned that I could miscarry at any time. 'We were stressed, and incredibly upset but we kept going.

'I had a steroid injection the week before they were born, and I am sure that meant they were stronger - they didn’t even need a ventilator. 'Looking at what we have now is incredible. They’re three little miracles.' Dad Liam, also 25, a teaching assistant at Kilton Thorpe School, in Brotton, said, 'It was emotionally draining, the constant worry and the trips for scans and specialists. We’ve had wonderful support from our family, friends, and at work, and the girls are worth all of the drama. Sometimes we find ourselves just standing and staring at them.' The pair met at Laurence Jackson School in Guisborough and, at 15, fell in love. They went on to do the same course at Teesside University before marrying, and then finding out they were expecting triplets.

'We had to buy a new car, and I only got a new one last September,' said Jessica. 'We’ve got a three-seater pram and it won’t fit in, so that goes on the roof rack. 'But everything at Boot’s is three-for-two, so that’s a bonus!'

But they sleep quite well, and we are loving it.' But one thing Liam and Jessica won’t be doing is buying them matching outfits. Jessica said: 'We want them to be individuals. Obviously, they’re going to have an incredible bond, and that’s something we’re very excited about. But we’ll be teaching them to be their own people.'

While some might decide to strut their stuff in a bikini, others go a step further and pose in their undies, just like mum-of-two Emma-Jayne Duff who has lost over two stone - after a family holiday motivated her to shed her excess weight. Feeling great, Emma-Jayne, 31, celebrated her weight-loss with a raunchy boudoir shoot. Scroll down for video . After: Emma says she felt amazing in the boudoir style photoshoot . Before: Emma-Jayne in July 2013 before she lost weight with husband Graeme, 37, right, and son Teddy, 6, left . At her heaviest, the petite 5ft 1inch blonde tipped the scales at 11st 10lb and was a size 16 but has slimmed to a trim 9st 12lb and a size 10. Emma-Jayne - who is married to private banker, Graeme, 37 - piled on the pounds after falling pregnant with her two children, Teddy, 6, and Poppy, 4. The beauty salon owner from St Neots, Cambridgeshire says, 'As a teenager, I was slim. But once I hit my twenties, I started putting on weight after socialising with friends. 'When I met my husband, Graeme, we ate out a lot and my weight started to creep up some more. I then put on 4st with each of my two pregnancies.' Emma-Jayne from Cambridgeshire posed in a boudoir photoshoot to mark her weight loss (left and right) Emma-Jayne with her Mum before she lost weight . 'After that, I always felt like the fat friend next to my slim group of girl pals. 'And despite being happily married and Graeme telling me I was gorgeous, I felt frumpy and didn't believe he could find me attractive.' It was only after Emma-Jayne went on a family break to Centre Parcs in January 2014 that she decided to ditch the weight for good. She said: 'While we were on holiday there, we were teaching my son Teddy to ride a bike without stabilizers. Emma-Jayne says she now feels confident after losing 2st . 'I was running alongside him and I was so aware of my tummy wobbling. All I felt was how heavy and uncomfortable I was as I ran. 'I also felt fat and frumpy whilst next to my slim sister-in-law at the pool. I thought to myself, I am too young to spend the rest of my life feeling unhappy like this. It was time to make a change.' Emma-Jayne joined Slimming World as soon as she returned from Centre Parcs. She began a healthy diet and with some determination the pounds began to shift. She also started incorporating exercise into her routine and took up kettlebell workouts twice a week. She said: 'Since losing the weight, I am so much happier and confident. When Graeme tells me I'm beautiful or sexy now, I believe him!' After: Recent pictures of Emma after she lost her weight . Left: Emma-Jayne before the weight loss and right: after her shedding the pounds . Emma-Jayne decided to get the edgy photoshoot after seeing an advert on Groupon. 'I have always been fascinated by 50s pin-ups and old Hollywood glamour so when I saw the advert, I immediately booked myself a shoot. 'In fact, I made a reservation for twelve weeks in advance so it could serve as motivation to work hard and keep losing weight. 'On the day of the shoot in April, I felt nervous. When I was bigger, I would strategically place myself next to friends and family to hide my body. But now I had no-one to hide behind. 'However once I had my hair and make-up done, I felt amazing and within minutes, I was in my element! I absolutely love the photos and I'm really proud of myself.'

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Despite people in their 60s embracing late-life marriage like never before veteran actress Maureen Lipman is not planning to join their ranks. According to Jack Malvern of The Times newspaper, the 68-year-old stage and TV star 'can't really see the point' in remarrying new love Guido Castro. The frank admission was made by the actress in an interview with The Lady, which will land on shelves this Friday. Maureen Lipman and Guido Castro sharing a drink and a kiss at the after party following the press night performance of West End play Daytona . Lipman was widowed ten years ago when her husband Jack Rosenthal passed away from cancer, but has found love again with the 70-year-old retired computer engineer. Mr Castro fled persecution in Egypt in 1956 and came to study at the University of Oxford. So why does the actress not see marriage in their future? 'I could if we were going to be left without a penny or were going to have children, but I can't really see the point of people of my age getting married - that's about ritual or if you're really religious,' The Times reports. 'I'm profoundly Jewish but I'm not really profoundly observant - it worries me, marriage, as a concept'. Lipman with husband, scriptwriter Jack Rosenthal, before his death in 2004 and their cat Pushkin . Currently starring in the West End production of Daytona, Lipman leaves no doubt as to whether she's found the real deal. 'He's wonderful, adorable, sweet lovely man and it's love. I'm bloody lucky to have two men in my life who have really loved me,' she says. She also speak candidly about her experience of losing her husband. 'There's no PhD in widowhood. When it's very new you are often . surrounded by friends, but there's a point when people think you should . pull yourself together and get over it. That point comes for some after . 12 months, or after 12 years and for some people, never.' The actress 'doesn't see the point' of remarrying . She also admits that in certain ways she is full of remorse about her marriage, something she says will never go away. The actress explains that you can never do as much as you can to make a . marriage work and never take back cruel comments or . uncaring jibes. It may come as no surprise that Lipman, known for her stirring performances and her wit, used humour to cope with her husband's suffering and passing. In the interview she says . she sometimes had to take her husband to the Royal Marsden Hospital dressed in . full oriental costume during her role in Thoroughly Modern Milli and describes . standing next to his bed with chopsticks in her hair and eyes pulled up at the sides . while her husband was hooked up to a drip. She also said comedy series Curb Your Enthusiasm gave her and her children an outlet during the painful time and says they'd watch two episodes a day. Figures from the Office of National Statistics found marriage is most on the rise amongst people aged between 65 and 69 but these stars are bucking the trend: . Mick Jagger remained unmarried despite 13 years with L'Wren Scott (who passed away in March) Dame Judi Dench lost her husband Michael Williams in 2001 and has said she does not want to remarry .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Gone are the days when a biscuit and a bone were considered a treat for our pets. Nowadays, we lavish our four-legged friends with toys, feed them expensive organic delicacies, allow them to share our beds and even take them on play dates. That's according to a new survey of more than 1,000 owners of dogs, cats and small furry friends such as rabbits and guinea pigs by recently launched online pet boutique, Astar Pets. The findings reveal pet owners spend on average £70 a month on their treasured friends, which is more than Brits spend on cake, cosmetics and even holidays. Of the 1,000 pet owners surveyed, 90% bought Christmas presents and 60% birthday presents . With 65 million pets in the UK and 45 per cent of UK households owning a pet, Britain is certainly a nation of pet lovers. But the survey found a staggering 88 per cent of owners admitted giving their pets as much care as they give their own children. CEO Chris Webster, who co-founded . Astar Pets with Quentin Griffiths (founder of both Achica and ASOS), said: 'The UK has transformed from being a nation of pet owners to being a nation of pet parents who enjoy spending time . with and treating their pet.' In their role as 'pet parents', 90 per cent of owners buy a Christmas present for their furry friend, 66 per cent give them a birthday present, 84 per cent allow their pet on the sofa and 66 per cent extend the privilege to their bed. Brits are a nation of 'pet parents' - 88% admit treating their pets like their children . And that's not where the parental similarities end. As many as 30 per cent of pets are taken on play dates with other animals. On average, our nation's much-loved animals own seven toys and 60 per cent of pets receive a treat each week. In fact, one in six pet owners revealed they spend more on presents for their pet than for their partner. Almost half spend over £50 a month on their pet, while a generous 5 per cent spend over £250. Cuddle up: Two thirds allow their pets to share their bed . Who's a pretty boy?: 'Pet parents' spend on average £70 a month on their pets . Our passion also extends to their . health and well-being.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . No time to make friends? Now you can hire then online . Feeling lonely? Fancy a natter about your day? For the price of a bottle of wine you can now hire someone to be your friend. You may think it sounds like the ultimate in desperation, but over half a million members of rentafrined.com would disagree. With Britain’s single-person households at 9.5 million and growing, it’s no wonder the friendship website, originally launched in the US, is gaining traction in the UK. The site facilitates connections between members and friends. For $24.95 per month (£15) members have hundreds and thousands of potential friends at their fingertips. ‘Friends’ create a Facebook-esque profile for free and charge members between £5-30 for the privilege of their company. The website clearly states no physical contact is allowed between any members and friends. In the UK alone there are 26,000 users with and over half a million other members in almost every country round the globe. The . platonic friendship business is also booming in Brazil, Canada and the . US. And unsurprisingly big cities like London and Chicago are hubs of . rental activity. Members . choose a friend by pursuing the many profiles, where the friends . describe themselves and post pictures, and then send their preferred companion a message. The friend then decides whether they want to meet the member and hence the platonic liaison begins. The . website boasts that people are using rentafriend.com for all kinds of . activities including shopping, going to the park, sharing poetry, . sightseeing, baking and even finding a wingman or woman to help pick up a date. The site is also used by the elderly or people whose disabilities impinge on their social lives, who are looking for company. Mainly . though, it’s just about hanging out. Thirty-two-year-old Ellie Coden, . one of the site’s friends up for hire, recently told the The Times . newspaper: ‘I can see why it’s popular because it’s so hard to meet . people in London and English people are really awkward.’ The website states that no physical contact between members and friends is allowed but suggests 'hanging out' and 'sightseeing' as potential activities . The . Italian-born ‘friend’, who charges herself out at £20 an hour adds: ‘If . I get on well with someone and they become a friend, I wouldn’t ask to . be paid.’ The friendship concept started in Japan, where it catered to divorced or widowed parents looking for fake spouses to hire for social occasions. The idea caught the attention of Scott Rosenbaum from Stewartsville New Jersey, who saw the potential for the rent a friend concept elsewhere in the world. ‘Family structure is a very big part of society in Japan, and the companies were offering “fill in” family members,’ explains Rosenbaum. ‘If there was a divorce, death, or situation in which a parent was not available, one could hire someone to pretend to be that family member. ‘If a child had a school activity in which the parents needed to attend, it was common for a single parent to hire a spouse to fill in for the school event. ‘After reading about the companies in Japan, I realized that there weren't any companies that were catering to the friend market elsewhere.’ ‘There were thousands of dating websites, but no websites where you could hire a local platonic friend,’ he adds. After doing some market research, Scott realised the potential for the untapped market.","Rentafriend.com taps into the 9.5 million single-person households in Britain .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nick Clegg today launched an extraordinary attack on the aid charity Oxfam, claiming there is 'nothing liberal' about its advert criticising the Government’s austerity programme. The Deputy Prime Minister warned the opposition to reducing the nation's debts for future generations would damage 'the values Oxfam is supposed to be campaigning for'. Government anger at erupted at the campaign which accused ministers of creating a ‘perfect storm’, including ‘benefit cuts’ and ‘unemployment’, which is forcing people into poverty. The Oxfam Twitter advert has been criticised by Tory MPs who warned the charity would lose support . Tory MPs called for the charities watchdog to investigate the mock film poster which also attacked zero-hours contracts, childcare costs and 'high prices'. But Mr Clegg is the first senior Lib Dem to condemn the stunt, sparking a major row with the charity which is usually seen as an ally by the party. He accused Oxfam of opposing the difficult decisions needed to bring down the deficit and lift the burden of debt. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: 'There is nothing fair, there is nothing progressive, there is nothing liberal, there is nothing in line with Oxfam’s values to say: ""Oh, it’s all too difficult, we’ll basically get our kids and our grandkids to pay off this generation’s debts’ because that’s what underlines all of this."" 'It appears to be an advertisement that is a blanket refusal to deal with a problem that you cannot duck. 'I really cannot understand how some people whose values I share of compassion, of seeking to make sure we do help the most vulnerable, are so willing to just airbrush out of the equation that you’ve got to – because it’s the fair thing to do – clear the decks for future generations.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused Oxfam of ignoring the difficult decisions which need to be taken to tackle the nation's debts . Mr Clegg said he 'flatly rejects' the idea that the government had failed to act on many of the issues raised, including childcare. 'Yes, there are some really difficult decisions to be made; yes, there are people who are feeling huge pressure on their daily, weekly budgets. 'But I really think just saying ""why do we have to do anything? Can’t we just wave a magic wand and it will all be sorted?"" 'I don’t think that helps anyone; and I don’t actually think it helps the values Oxfam is supposed to be campaigning for.' Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of the Number Ten policy advisory board, said Oxfam was 'behaving disgracefully' Oxfam has insisted it had a ‘duty’ to highlight hardship in the UK, but Tories branded its attack a ‘disgrace’ as official figures showed another record increase in the number of people in work. Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of the Number Ten policy advisory board, said: ‘Oxfam are behaving disgracefully by misleading the public about Government policies and their political campaigning may be in breach of their charitable remit. ‘They have shown their true colours and are now nothing more than a mouthpiece for left wing propaganda.’ Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It is sad, when a charity doing such great work abroad to alleviate poverty, becomes embroiled in politically partisan attacks in an attempt to compete with all the other head-in-the-sand left-wing groups and grab a few headlines” Political commentator Tim Montgomerie, former chief of staff to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, said: ‘I won’t be giving to Oxfam again. I want to help the poorest people of the world, not finance left-wing politics.’ Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP, accused Oxfam of engaging in an overtly ‘political’ that was not borne out by the facts. ‘My concern is that charities should walk the walk - helping make a difference to people at the front line - not talk the talk - engage in advertising or political campaigning. They should make a difference to people in their daily life,’ he said. ‘I think we can all see the messaging here and what Oxfam is intending to say. My bigger concern in many ways is that a lot of it is not accurate; we have got a government that is reforming zero-hours contracts, we have seen unemployment fall by 400,000, we have seen inequality - the gap between the rich and the poor - falling, we have seen relative poverty falling, and we have seen food poverty falling according to OECD figures.’ Ben Phillips, Oxfam’s campaigns and policy director, defended the advert, arguing the campaign was not political and that the charity has a duty to draw attention to the hardship ‘suffered by poor people we work with in the UK.’ ‘Fighting poverty should not be a party political issue,’ he added. The Charity Commission said it was considering a complaint about the campaign to determine whether a full-scale inquiry should be launched.","Lib Dem leader says extraordinary advert risks damaging Oxfam's values .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Whether you’re rowing your boat, winding the bobbin up or doing the Hokey Cokey, having a little boogie with your baby can do more than just entertain them, according to research. The new study has found that moving in sync with your tot can actually turn them into more helpful children. Bouncing at the same time to music with 14-month-old babies encourages them to display altruistic behaviour, the study from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, found. Bouncing in unison with your baby can encourage them to be more helpful little beings, the study found . Laura Cirelli, lead author of the new paper, due to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Developmental Science, said: '‘Movement is a fundamental part of music that affects social behaviour from a very young age.' Cirelli, and her colleagues in the department of psychology, neuroscience and behaviour, showed that 14-month-old babies were much more likely to help an adult person after the experience of bouncing up and down in time to music with them. Bounce in sync with your baby and reap the rewards of their helpful behaviour . Cirelli . and fellow doctoral student Kate Einarson tested 68 babies, many of whom . could not yet walk, to see if bouncing to music with another person . made them more likely to assist that person. Some babies were bounced in sync with a researcher standing opposite them while others were bounced at a different tempo. When the song was over, the researcher performed several simple tasks, including drawing a picture with a marker. While drawing she would pretend to drop the marker to see whether the infant would pick it up and hand it back to her – a test of altruism in babies. The babies who had been bounced in time with the researcher were much more likely to toddle over, pick up the object and pass it back to the researcher, compared to infants who had been bounced at a different tempo. The findings suggest that when we sing, clap, bounce or dance in time to music with our babies, these shared experiences of synchronous movement help form social bonds between adults and babies.","Study was carried out at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Magnificent palatial gardens, tasteful pastel bunting, pom-pom crown-emblazoned party hats, regally decorated cake pops and a handful of angelic children crowding around a little boy dressed in red, white and blue. What could these beautiful images show other than Prince George’s first birthday bash? In reality, the only missing element from this perfectly elegant affair is the prince himself. The star of the show in these images is Oscar, a one-year-old model, and rather than Kensington Palace,  the elegant surroundings are Riverhill Himalayan Gardens in Sevenoaks. Oscar sits on a picnic mat dressed to look like Prince George celebrating his first birthday on July 22 . 'George's' guests have all been dressed in quintessentially British style for the imaged party . The classy party was organised by event stylist Katie Burnett who chanelled the Duchess of Cambridge's style to envisage what the party to celebrate Prince George's first birthday on July 22 could look like. Katie, who owns party planning boutique Les Enfants has been the brains behind many children's parties for the Kensington set and knows exactly how it’s done. ‘The style is based on Kate's love of a simple, elegant style,’ explains Katie. Katie took her inspiration from the recent Royal tour of Australia, which offered the perfect opportunity to understand Kate’s baby taste. Prince George earned his fashion stripes back in April during a visit to Sydney, Australia . It may look like a palace but the setting for the party is in fact Riverhill Himalayan Gardens in Sevenoaks . Too good to eat: Crown-emblazoned cake pops in blue - the perfect royal party fare . ‘Judging by Kate’s choices for Prince George's outfits on the trip, her taste is very traditional,’ Katie says. ‘So that’s how we styled the shoot. 'We included lots of giant balloons, which are a very popular at the moment - as are the tassel garlands.’ Of course, the party food was not only elegant but perfectly on trend and included cake pops, macaroons and swizzle sticks. 'For children, cake pops are a neat way of eating cake, often given out at end of parties now instead of a wrapped piece of cake. They are totally delicious and just enough as little taster,’ Katie says. The clever little bite-sized cakes on a stick, which came from across the pond, are also ever-so-slightly gooier than regular cakes and a little less messy. One-year-old Oscar - aka Prince George - getting used to wearing a crown at his imaginary party . Happy birthday! A crown fit for a prince - just one of the items Katie believes would be perfect for the big day . ‘Macaroons . are obviously a big food trend too and this filters into children's . parties,' Katie adds. 'For Prince George we embellished them with the . little edible crowns. They are delicious and just melt in the mouth. ‘Marshmallow sticks and chocolate-covered Oreos are also big at the moment.’Katie also made sure George's little guests looked the part. ‘We wanted . the clothing for this special royal event to be quintessentially British . so we selected brands that make timeless clothing to suit the regal . birthday theme,’ she says. ‘The girls' dresses are simple yet extremely elegant in beautiful pastel shades and . the boys are dressed in very traditional and classic lines. ‘The . prince is wearing smocked nautical dungarees by Rachel Riley as worn by .

Elegant design: How Katie imagines Kate and William will celebrate Prince George's first birthday . 'And one of his guests is fashioning a gorgeous romper with a crown motif by the same brand.’ And if you’re planning your own birthday bash? ‘My biggest tip would be to create a theme and colour scheme that incorporates your child’s likes and interests and add a touch of home-made for a unique birthday party style,’ Kate says. ‘You could choose a fill-in invitation, a designed one or maybe make your own using your little one’s hand or foot prints, which adds a lovely personal touch. ‘Depending on the scale of your party choose your venue with care, it is important to have a dedicated and safe area for the birthday child and their young friends, even if you have older children attending.' One of George's guests gives a little nod to his host with a crown embellished romper . 'An intimate family party at home can often a good choice for first birthday parties,' Katie says. Often at first birthday parties with extended friends and family there are a range of children of different ages. ‘This can make choosing the entertainment tricky,’ she says. ‘But you will find your local baby and toddler classes will offer party options to entertain babies, toddlers, younger guests and parents too!' Soft play is also a way to create a safe space for the birthday boy or girl and you could even bring along toys and ride-ons to create a fun area,’ she says.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . A pair of Game Of Thrones fans took their love of the show to somewhat extreme lengths when they tied the knot in a ceremony inspired by the bloodthirsty fantasy show. Thankfully though, this was no Red Wedding like the massacre that occurs in the hit series in which pretty much all family and friends at the gathering were murdered! But Darren Prew and Kerry Ford, from Hereford, did dress up rather convincingly as their favourite characters for their big day. Scroll down for video .

Ms Ford even arrived at the service on a white horse, while Mr Prew arrived with two fierce looking dogs on leashes. The pair won the marriage makeover when they entered a competition held by streaming service blinkbox Movies who are showing the fourth series of the hit show.

Little did I know that he then went online and applied - without telling me.' But she was impressed by her new husband’s makeover, saying: 'I thought the transformation was amazing, it was like marrying Jon Snow. It was very, very weird and surreal to see Darren like that.' Mr Prew, who said it was 'too good an opportunity to pass up', added: 'We were planning on getting married next year, but I knew we just had to go for it.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . They say three's a crowd, but this weekend Neville Jone, Edna Doodson and Iris Hopkin couldn't have been happier in each others company. After all, it's not every day you get to celebrate your 85th birthday - as a set of triplets. The trio were born in Manchester just 20 minutes apart in June 1929. And 85 years later are as close as ever, still speaking to each other two to three times a week. Twins had run in the family and their mother Margaret had been expecting two babies before youngest sibling Iris arrived to make it a hat-trick. Britain's oldest set of triplets - (from left) Edna Doodson, Nevile Jones and Iris Hopkin - celebrated their 85th birthday this weekend. They were born just 20 minutes apart in June 1929 . She weighed just 2lbs and was given . little chance of survival but pulled through. Edna weighed 3lbs and . Neville a healthier 4lbs. The trio originally from Manchester, were inseparable in their childhood and although they were parted during the wartime evacuation, they lived in neighbouring houses in Lancaster. They still remain very close today and despite their age and the fact they live at opposite ends of the country, see each other at least once or twice a year. Edna still lives in Manchester with her husband Ken while widow Iris lives in Blackpool. Neville lives with his wife Edna in Portesham, near Weymouth, Dorset, where the trio met this weekend for their celebration. Nevile Edna and Iris with the midwife in 1929 (left) and celebrating being 85 years young this weekend (right) Their family has also submitted a claim to the Guinness World Records after learning that they are four years older than John Davies, Mary Davis and Joy Hillary who were believed to be the country's oldest living triplets. Neville said, 'My daughter has found out that we appear to be the oldest triplets in the country. 'We had a good upbringing and ate well and none of us feel our age now. It would be interesting and nice to know if we are the oldest triplets in Britain or the world.' The triplets hand-in-hand in 1936 . As bridesmaids and pageboys in 1934 (left) and still looking marvelous 80 years on (right) The siblings were born to parents Margaret and Reuben, a docker on the Manchester ship canal. They had an elder sister, also called Margaret who died seven years ago aged 81. Neville said, 'There is a long line of twins in our family and my mother thought she was expecting twins with us. 'In those days there weren't any scans so it must have been a shock for her, although from what I understand she was unconscious for most of it. 'I was the first to be born but there was only about 20 minutes between us. Iris only weighed the same as a bag of sugar and it was a bit touch and go for her. 'We had a great upbringing and never suffered from loneliness or had an argument.' The trio with parents Rueben and Marg on a trip to the seaside in the 1930s . 'We were evacuated during the war to Lancaster when we were aged 10. Iris and Edna lived in one house and I was just two houses down,' he adds. Neville worked as a telecoms engineer while Edna and Iris were machinists. Neville met his wife, a nurse, when he went into hospital after an accident and they have now been married for 61 years. The couple relocated to Cornwall where they owned and ran a village store before retiring to Dorset where they live with their daughter Alison and her husband Duncan. Between them, the triplets have created quite a legacy. Iris has four children, including a set of twins and nine grandchildren. Edna has two children, four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Neville has two children and three grandchildren. The Guinness World Records is currently looking into Neville, Edna and Iris' claim as the oldest triplets in the UK and possibly the world. According to Guinness, the last record of the world's oldest triplets dates back to 2005 and they were Minna Blocker, Luise Stefener and Bertholdine Bernecker from Ludwig, Germany, who were born in 1914.

Married with a child, Pyretta Blaze and Andy Filth (not their real names) from South Wales, say they're just like any other couple, apart from one slight difference -- they like to drink each other's blood. Andy and Pyretta, who appeared on This Morning to encourage more open-mindedness for their lifestyle, are part of the UK's 15,000 strong vampire community. Self-confessed vampire Andy, likened the act of slurping his partners blood to sex and said, 'When you're drinking each others blood you're connected to each others souls.' He said the taste didn't make him feel sick but admitted, 'It's not like strawberries -- it's got a metallic taste.' Scroll down for video . Your friendly vampires next-door: Pyretta Blaze (left) and Andy Filth (right) appeared on ITV's This Morning . Nowadays the couple satisfy their blood cravings in the privacy of their own bedroom, but in their single days they would go out on the prowl, like any other youngsters. 'I used to go to gatherings where the exchange of blood would happen,' explained Pyretta, who was keen to point out that it was safe and nothing for the public to be scared about. She assured viewers that they don't lurk around in the dark and only drink blood in the confines of the vampire community. 'Everyone is completely vetted to check they have no mental health history and have a clean blood record,' she said. 'Everyone has a full examination - mentally and physically.' 'You pick one partner you're totally happy with and it's very safe, clean and sterile.' When Philip then inquired if it was form of sex, she replied, 'Yes, of course! 'We are very health conscious - as you would be when having sex. We are very responsible,' she added. Pyretta (left) used to go to vampire gatherings to get her blood fix before she met Andy (right) But one thing that really gets Pyretta's blood boiling is Hollywood's portrayal of vampires. 'It really makes me mad!' she said. 'People are so misled and easily influenced by things in Hollywood. Interview with two vampires: The couple say they want to change misconceptions about the bloody-thirsty lifestyle . 'I can look into the mirror and do my hair!' she said referring to the myth that if vampires look at their own reflection the mirror cracks. So what actually goes on behind vampires' bedroom doors? 'You can have a ceremonial pin to draw blood,' Andy explained. 'You don't need a lot, just a small dab.' 'I do it from my neck just behind me ear,' he said revealing a tattoo of a vampire bite on the side of his neck. 'And we do try to use same spot every time.' 'It's not cut deep enough to scar. It's not self harm,' Pyretta was quick to add. Pyretta blames Hollywood for the misunderstanding surrounding vampires' scary image (as depicted above) 'The amount of blood you drawer depends on what you eat and drink because that affects blood flow,' he explained. 'But we use whatever comes out -- I wouldn't keep cutting,' he said. Of course, their hobby comes with a health warning and they admitted it's 'enormously dangerous'.'It can't just be done because you feel like it. You have to know what you're doing,' said Andy. 'It's our spiritual connection to each other. We have a child, which makes us as close as we can be. But the next step is to be joined by our souls. But Andy swears his love for Pyretta trumps his vampire lifestyle. 'If one of us wanted to stop, it wouldn't be over,' he said. 'I see it as bonus. It's something we're both into and a big part of our life. But if it was to go away we wouldn't need to find someone else. Also on the programme was psychologist, Dr Emyr Williams, who has been studying the vampires for ten years. 'It's a religion,' he explained. 'It's taken me 6 years to get the trust of the community so I can begin my research. It was very difficult because they are often mocked as society doesn't understand them. 'I've found out that these are normal people. They may need to consume blood and psychic energy - but they may not actually like that about themselves.'

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Bernice Thompson, 34, cured her hyperhidrosis using new MraDry treatment . Ever experienced that awful feeling of lifting your arms only to realise you're sporting some unwanted dark patches? Even the thought of it is enough to induce a cold sweat. But for one unfortunate mother, the crippling embarrassment of having visible sweat patches was a daily occurrence. And no amount of deodorant could cure it. Following the birth of her daughter three and a half years ago, 34-year-old Bernice Thompson from Cardiff was diagnosed with 'unexplained hyperhidrosis', which doctors attributed to hormonal change. Until the age of 34, Bernice had never . suffered with sweating. As a nurse, she was constantly running around . wards, but always managed to control her perspiration with a spritz . of deodorant. But following the . birth of her daughter her sweating became excessive until it reached the point that deodorant was completely ineffective. 'As a nurse, part of my uniform is to . wear the traditional scrubs. Anyone who suffers with hyperhidrosis will . tell you that light colours, blues and greys are a no-go, yet I had no . choice,' she explains. 'I felt completely embarrassed, as the wet patches would show up . on my scrubs. I was very aware that the patients would look. I felt . dirty and was always self conscious that I might smell.' After her diagnosis, Bernice was left in despair and was desperate to find a cure, but the only option she found was Botox. 'I didn’t know of any other treatment so . decided to give a try,' she says. 'It was effective short-term but I had to continue going back and spending money because I needed around three sessions a year. It was also very . painful and I would dread the thought of the next appointment being round the corner.' Bernice . continued with the treatment, but was desperate . for a more permanent solution. Eventually, after two and a half years of enduring Botox, Bernice's online research uncovered MiraDry - a non-invasive and permanent solution . to hyperhidrosis newly available in the UK. The treatment, works by delivering precisely controlled electromagnetic energy using a handheld device to kill underarm sweat glands. While the sweat glands are being eliminated through electromagnetic technology, the top layers of the skin are simultaneously cooled and protected. Dermatologist and founder of the Specialist Skin Clinic, Dr Maria Gonzalez, pioneered the treatment in the UK and explains, 'Miradry works by delivering energy to the underarm sweat glands, whichheats and destroys them eliminating them permanently.' Say goodbye to sweaty armpits: New MiraDry treatment offers a permanent solution to sufferers of excessive perspiration . The procedure usually lasts one hour and . a second procedure is normally recommended around 3 months later to . create permanent results. After talking through the treatment carefully with Dr Gonzalez, Bernice booked . herself in for the £3,000 treatment. 'When I worked out the cost in terms of having . a permanent solution to my condition, it seemed like a no-brainer. I . would ultimately end up saving money in comparison to continuous Botox . for the rest of my life. 'Plus I could not put a value on the effect it . would have on my self esteem and confidence.' 'The treatment started with a small numbing injection before the machine head was placed under my armpit and put to work. There was a bit of swelling for a day or so after my treatment, but no pain.' The real test came when Bernice was due for her next hospital shift on the Monday. 'I was amazed. I wore my scrubs all day but not a drop of sweat could be seen,' she says. Not only was Bernice able to ditch the deodorant, she also experienced an unexpected but welcome side effect. 'I have also noticed a dramatic reduction in underarm hair,' she explains. Bernice is due to go back for a follow up treatment in a few weeks but is already feeling underarm confident.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . An American artist has . exposed her most private moments in a series of self-portraits that . portray her eating behind closed doors. The thought-provoking images, painted with almost photographic realism, depict the artist in different secret bingeing scenarios. In . one she's surrounded by cupcakes on the sofa, another shows her lying . on a bed covered in fast food wrappers and in others she's eating in the . bath and even in the loo. Self portrait: This painting shows artist, Lee Price, bingeing on jam doughnuts . Lee Price from Santa Fe in New Mexico, USA, who painted these compelling . pieces 'grappled with eating disorders' growing up and wanted to explore . the complex relationship some women have with food through her art. 'When I’m having difficulties in my life food is still how I deal with things,' admits the artist, now 47. 'It's not the severity that it was, but I might grab a pint of Haagen Dazs without thinking.' 'The paintings are very personal,' Lee tells MailOnline. 'They explore compulsive behavior. I use food as the focus, but . any number of other things could stand in for food.' The art of bingeing: The images are all set in private places - including the toilet - as in the image above . 'They're about the multifarious ways we check out. We use food to . seek solace, but then our search for comfort turns into a way of not . being present in the moment,' she explains. The artist believes that women's relationship with food is central to the relationship we have to the world. 'By portraying women involved in as . intimate an act as eating, I am exploring a broader context of . women’s situation,' she explains. The lifelike paintings are a narrative on women's relationship with food . 'My paintings, I hope, point . the viewer toward asking what we are truly hungry for, and what might be . a healthier way of expressing that hunger, and seeking out its . satiation,' she says. Although the images are about secrecy and compulsion, the artist doesn't associate her paintings with shame. 'In fact, there’s a kind of defiance in the gaze in many of the paintings,' she says. 'I . get various interpretations,' says the artist. 'Many people miss the connection to . emotional eating my paintings represent. 'Then I get tonnes of emails from . people – men and women both – who respond on a very personal level to . the content of my work. Both responses resonate for me.' The artist depicts herself enthusiastically snacking on her bed in her pyjamas . 'What’s important to me is not so much how people take them in, but . simply that they take them in, each in their own way,' she says. What also stands out in the images are the unusual settings -- the bathroom, toilet and bedroom aren't your typical eating spots. 'I wanted to use a private place, a peaceful place of solitude, . and set against it this frenetic activity of compulsive behavior in . which the subjects are engaged,' explains Lee. Chinese take-away in the bath. What's not to love? 'The irony then becomes that in the midst . of the chaos of their behavior there is peace. The women just can’t see . that,' adds the artist.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Victoria Evans, who was brutally tortured by her adoptive mother for 20 years, has spoken of her fears about her abuser's release from prison next month. Eunice . Spry, 70, from Gloucestershire, will be let out of jail in July and could be rehoused just . miles from the daughter she so cruelly abused. Victoria, also from Gloucestershire, today made her first ever television appearance on ITV's This Morning. 'I wish her no harm but I don't want to ever see her again,' she said. 'When I look into her eyes I see so many horrific memories.' Victoria Evans, who was tortured for nearly 20 years by her adoptive mother, appeared on This Morning to tell her harrowing story . 'There have been concerns she'll try and make contact,' she adds. Eunice . was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of 26 charges of child . abuse against her two foster children and Victoria, her adopted daughter. Now 28, Victoria spoke of the vile abuse she endured but says she is stronger and happier than ever. Telling her harrowing story, she said, 'She would force a stick down my throat and would count and count whilst I screamed in agony. Imminent release: Eunice Spry, Victoria's foster mother, is due for release in July . 'She would then stand on top of me to stop me from screaming. 'We were always starved -- sometimes for three months at a time. And if she saw we looked too healthy she would make us vomit.' She would then make her daughter consume her own sick.. 'She was the same with all of us,' she said referring to her two foster siblings. 'Sometimes she was a bit nicer to one to get us against each other.' She then told of the guilt and torture she endured when her adoptive mother's biological children were killed in a freak accident. 'A lorry driver was playing with his radio and ploughing into the back of us. I was hanging with broken neck over two dead bodies over me. 'Six months later when I woke up from the coma she said, ""Why is it scum like you grace this earth?"" 'She then said the devil looks after his own. She the kept me in a wheelchair for four years. If I ever tried to sit up she would push me back in by my jaw.' Victoria's escape came at the age of 18 when, in her role as nanny to a younger brother, she was allowed out the house. 'People said, ""Why have you got strangulation marks?"" I didn't want to lie to them. That's when I realised that what was going on at home was not right. These people were being different.' Victoria Spry, 28, poses for a portrait with her dogs in Gloucestershire, England . Eventually she left home and brought charges against Eunice. However, despite the vile abuse, her . mother had such power over her that Victoria still craved her affection. 'At first my mother was writing letters to me saying, ""I love you"" and she'd call me ""a special daughter"". It would rip my heart out.' Disturbing image of Victoria, abused at the hands of her own adoptive mother . Eunice was found guilty of 22 charges, including assault and actual bodily harm. 'I was grieving when first happened,' Victoria admitted. 'I was in shock.' 'Eunice's father died three days into the trial so  there was guilt, guilt, guilt!' she said. 'But I know what I did was right. 'Now, I'm a different person. I've got amazing friends, I'm in a relationship and I've got two gorgeous dogs,' she said in an inspiring show of strength. 'You can always get up, dust yourself and keep going. Don't use your past as an excuse,' she said. But sadly, Victoria felt there was a 'ridiculous lack of support' for people in her position. 'There are people up that need picking up and helping,' said Victoria. And by raising awareness that's exactly what Victoria is now hoping to do.","Victoria Evans was tortured by her adoptive mother Eunice Spry .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . For most women, shifting post-baby weight can be a challenge, but for one mum-of-three, pregnancy turned out to be the most effective diet she could have hoped for. Maggie Groome, 35, went from 20st down to 10st after violent morning sickness during her three pregnancies made her lose weight. The mum-of-three from Cricklewood in Northwest London suffered from hyperemesis, a severe form of morning sickness which caused constant nausea and vomiting. Maggie weighed 20st before she fell pregnant for the first time (left), but now weighs a healthy 10st and wears a size 12 (right) And she's not the only one: the Duchess of Cambridge was famously diagnosed with hyperemesis while she was pregnant with Prince George. Despite the deeply unpleasant symptoms, Maggie feels lucky to have gained not only three beautiful children but also her dream body. The supermarket assistant said, 'I'd always been a bigger girl, even from my school days.' A proud Maggie with her husband Chet Masters and children Taylor Masters, nine, Lanesra, five and Darian, four . 'By the time we started trying for children when I was in my mid-20s I was nearly 20st and was worried my weight would make it harder for me to conceive,' she continued. 'So when I found out I'd fallen pregnant I was over the moon - but I wasn't looking forward to putting on even more weight! 'As it turned out, I experienced the exact opposite. The morning sickness was so bad that I actually lost weight.' Maggie with her husband Chet (left) worried her weight meant she wouldn't be able to fall pregnant but now has three healthy children and a body to be proud of (right) 'I wouldn't wish hyperemesis on anyone but looking back now I can say it came with surprising benefits,' she added. Maggie and her fiance Chet Masters, 31, discovered she was pregnant in 2003. She said: 'I assumed the morning sickness would ease after a couple of months, but it never went away. 'I suffered constant waves of nausea and I couldn't keep down anything I ate.' Maggie with her oldest child Taylor, now nine. She lost 3 stone during her pregnancy . Increasingly concerned, Maggie attended an appointment with her GP, who diagnosed hyperemesis. Hyperemesis gravidarum, which affects up to one in 50 pregnant women, is characterised by vomiting, nausea and dehydration. Maggie was given anti-sickness medication, but the symptoms only got worse as her pregnancy progressed. Maggie with her first son Tyler as a baby (left) and pregnant with her second child Lanesra (right) She said: 'There wasn't much the doctor could do about it. I just had to soldier on in the hope the sickness would go away, but it carried on even until the late stage of pregnancy.' Maggie's son Taylor was born in May 2004 weighing 5lbs 13oz. After arriving home from hospital, she was amazed to discover that far from gaining weight, she'd actually lost three stone. She said: 'I was stunned. Over the years I'd tried every fad diet going, but nothing had worked. It was amazing to think that, of all things, having a baby had shifted the pounds.' In October 2013 she discovered she was pregnant for a second time. Once again, the morning sickness returned - and she lost even more weight. She said: 'I'd prayed that the sickness wouldn't come back but it did with a vengeance. I was completely miserable . 'It was almost unbearable and I couldn't face eating the tiniest portion, even though I was desperate to ensure my unborn child had all the nutrients it needed. 'There was some concern the baby wasn't getting enough food, so I was relieved when my daughter finally arrived.' Lanesra was born in July 2008 weighing 5lb 2oz. She then discovered that over the course of the pregnancy she had lost a remarkable four stone. Maggie at 17 stone (right) after Tyler was born and four stone lighter after having Lanesra (right) When Maggie fell pregnant for the third and final time, she was prepared for the return of the hyperemesis, but this time the aftermath of the birth was more problematic. Her son Darian was born underweight in February 2010 at 4lb 12oz. He was also severely jaundiced, requiring a six-week stay in intensive care. Maggie, who this time lost 3st 7lb, developed serious gastroparesis, a condition which stops the movement of food from the the stomach to the small intestine. The happy mum with Taylor Masters, nine, Lanesra, five and Darian, four . Her weight fell to a skeletal 6st 11lbs in just three months as doctors battled to keep her hydrated through a drip. She said: 'The weight kept falling away and I was exhausted. I'd just been through another rough pregnancy and I now had three little ones to look after. I was completely overwhelmed. 'After I recovered I decided that I didn't want any more children. I wasn't sure my body could sustain a fourth pregnancy. 'I'd been through hell with the hyperemesis but I was so grateful for what it had given me - not only three beautiful children, but a body I was proud of.' Maggie said her pregnancies not only gave her three wonderful children but also the perfect body . Once recovered from the gastroparesis Maggie put on just over three stone and now weighs a healthy 10st - 9st 9lb less than before her pregnancies. She's also able to wear size 12 clothing. She said: 'I was sick so much during my three pregnancies that I'm worried I've damaged my teeth. 'Every day felt like a challenge and I wouldn't go through that again for anything. 'But having survived, I feel strangely grateful. I'm now fitter and happier than I was when I was overweight. I'm not a skinny girl - and I don't want to be - but I'm much more careful about what I eat and I feel much healthier. 'The fact is that pregnancy was the best diet I've ever been on.'

Other famous faces include Paul O'Grady, Michelle Collins, Mark Foster, Martin Clunes and Simon Callow, who have all been photographed with their beloved animals for Pawless, Maria Slough's photography exhibition.

Scroll down for video . Michelle Collins and Humphrey, her gorgeous three-year-old pug/shiatsu . Each celebrity has nominated a charity and the exhibition aims to raise awareness and money for various causes. 'There were quite a few funny moments shooting this,' London-based Maria tells MailOnline, 'And some wonderfully inspiring ones too.' 'When I went to photograph Simon Callow, he'd recently moved house and his dogs weren't sure about new people,' she says.

Mark Foster and Bailey: 'I have always had an affinity with dogs,' says the swimming champ . The exhibition also includes members of public and high-profile animal charity activist Jill Robinson. 'I went to photograph Jill in China and lived amongst rescued bears for a week, which was extraordinary,' says Maria. 'It was so humbling.' So where did the idea come from?

'He was a bulldog called George and when I picked him up as a puppy I . could fit him into the palm of my hand. What I hadn't bargained for was . the bond that I formed with him and the place he had in my life and my . heart. It was like a huge love affair. 'He was the kindest and softest . natured dog and I took him with me everywhere. I took him to swimming competitions and I was amazed at what an ice breaker he was in social . situations.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . The notorious Kray brothers terrorised the East End of London during the 1950s and 60s. The Firm, as their brutal gang was known, was responsible for countless violent assaults, armed robberies, running protection rackets and for the murders of Jack 'the hat' McVitie and George Cornell. And now intimate diary entries penned by the the tragic wife of Reggie Kray reveal that his reign of terror knew no bounds, and was just as fierce in his home life as he was within his underground world of crime. Ronnie Kray (left), who died in 1995, toasting the future happiness of his brother Reggie  (right) and Frances Shae (middle) after their marriage, which lasted only eight weeks before Frances left him . In her private scribblings Frances Kray, who first met Reggie when she was just 16, describes her hellish life with the . gangster and having to share a bed with a gun and a flick-knife. Her marriage to Reggie lasted only eight weeks but she wrote of the abuse and drunken temper bouts she endured at the hands of the East End villain. Describing . how Reggie kept a cache of deadly weapons in their bedroom, she said, . 'He came back night time. By the side of bed gun, sword, knife, chopper, . flick-knife.' 'He used to sleep with flick-knife under his pillow,' she added. He later took to keeping a loaded rifle by his bed after making sure every door and window of their home was locked, the journal reveals. The diary records how Reggie, who died in 2000, often told Frances to ‘shut your mouth’ and that he would warn her he'd ‘make her suffer’ and torment her suggesting he was having affairs with club hostesses. Happier times: A letter from Reggie to Frances when he was in Wandsworth prison in 1960, which begins 'My Dearest Darling Frankie...' Reggie's letter to Frances from Wandsworth prison, which ends, 'Well my darling that's all for now...' along with romantic words of a song, 'I love you more than ever, And yearn for the time we are together' Frances also wrote of how much time the notorious gangster spent at his mother’s house, where his hardman twin brother Ronnie walked around in his underwear. Desperate Frances kept the log while she sought a way out of her unhappy marriage with Reggie. Tragically, she eventually committed suicide by taking a fatal drug overdose in 1967. Her five page diary along with over 60 letters that Reggie wrote to her while he was in prison before they were married are now being sold in auction by a direct descendant of her family. Reggie and Frances Kray on holiday in Jersey . Frances (far left) and Reggie (far right) on holiday in Jersey with friends . Frances with Reggie (far right) and friends in Jersey -- the smile masks a terrifying marriage. according to diary entries that have recently come to light . The . letters show a Jeckyll and Hyde side to Reggie’s personality, as he . comes across as loving and affectionate in some and bitter and spiteful . in others. In one letter he wrote in August 1960, the mobster calls his then girlfriend a ‘spiteful little tormentor’ and says she was ‘humiliating’ him in front of other inmates after she told him she had been out dancing. There are also numerous black and white photos of the couple, some of them previously unseen, that are being sold by auctioneers Gorringes of Lewes, East Sussex. The overall pre-sale estimate for the items, which are going up for auction tomorrow, is £4,000.

Frances and Reggie Kray (third and fourth from left) with friends at a London Club . Jane Anderson, a spokesperson from the auction house, said, 'This archive is coming from the estate of Frances Kray. 'Reggie met Frances when she was 16. At first they were pen pals while he was in Wandsworth Prison and the letters were very chatty and friendly. 'The second batch is from after they were engaged and the tone is completely different, often berating her for not writing enough letters. 'They had an unhappy marriage and it appears that someone told Frances to write down incidents while she was trying to divorce Reggie. A diary written by Frances Kray about her life with Reggie (pictured above on their wedding day) has recently comes to light and tells an unhappy tale of their relationship . 'It seems life with him was impossible. She spent most of her time alone in their flat and when he was there he was often drunk and he slept in a bed with various weaponry. 'When he was in prison it was safe for her to have a relationship with him. But on the outside, she was way out of her depth and was very frightened of Reggie, as anyone would have been. 'Considering what happened to Frances, it is a very poignant archive. A diary kept by the tragic wife of Reggie Kray describing her hellish . life with the gangster has emerged . The heart-wrenching diary of Frances Kray describes a terrifying life with gangster Reggie here . 'When she died she was buried in the Kray family plot. She had tried to change her name back to her maiden name of Shea and her family tried to get her grave moved from the plot but they didn’t succeed. In her diary, Frances described her lonely life at their flat in London’s Marble Arch where she lived when she was 25. 'Always drunk and slurring and falling all over the place', reads one of Frances's extracts . Her entries are written in abbreviated form, but tell a harrowing story. She wrote: 'Reggie came in late every night drunk. Got up every morning, two minutes to dress, left me all day, came back late at night drunk. 'Went to his house - his brother walked in bedroom in underwear, swore at me. 'Went back to flat Marble Arch, came back night time. 'By the side of the bed -- gun, sword, knife, chopper, flick-knife. He used to sleep with flick-knife under his pillow. 'I phoned my brother up to get me out of this place and said something about guns. His brother swore at me and started collecting all the guns in a laundry bag.' She goes on to say how the Krays called a friend at a nearby pub who came and took the weapons away in fear the police had been called. She went on to write, 'I said something about me looking for a new flat. He said ""shut your mouth"".' Frances was then admitted to hospital ‘for some rest’. She wrote, 'Him and his friend took me to the hospital, he was swearing and shouting at me in the car.' She went on: 'Couldn’t stand it anymore - left him. When I was packing my suitcases to leave he told me he would bring up fictitious characters against me.' Summing up his behaviour, she adds: 'Always drunk - slurring and falling all over the place.'

"By . Naomi Greenaway . For most couples, a romantic proposal involves Champagne, roses, chocolates or something equally indulgent, but this daredevil climber popped the question 2,500ft in the air. Richard Crabtree asked Angela Jones, 45, to marry him while hanging precariously off the edge of a cliff-face - just moments after they scaled Napes Needle in the Lake District. Luckily, she said yes. The 40-year-old climber, from Colne, Lancashire, surprised his bride-to-be on their first climb of the iconic rock pinnacle, having the ring tucked away in his bag throughout the hour-long walk to the base of the climb, near the top of Great Gable mountain. The moment she said 'Yes!': The couple whooping for joy 2,500ft high after Richard's proposal (left) and sharing a romantic kiss at the peak (right) Angela, who met Richard on a walking trip to the beauty spot eight years ago, said it was an 'amazing feeling' adding : 'We’d never climbed Napes Needle before but we are both preparing . to climb Mount Blanc this summer so we thought it would be good . training. 'I had no idea Richard was planning to propose because we had always said we would never get married. 'We . got to Napes Needle and I didn’t think I was going to be able to make . it to the top. It was quite a nice day but it was a long and arduous . walk and the climb looked precarious,' she admits. Happy couple: Richard and Angela on a trip to Rome - a more traditional place to pop the question . 'I watched . Richard climb from the shoulder up to the tip of the Needle. He . struggled a little bit but I knew that if I got into difficulty he would . ensure I was safe and secure. 'I . climbed up to the top and I was absolutely overjoyed just to have been . able to do that, then suddenly Richard turned to me and said: ""You know . how you say I never do anything romantic. Well here we are by the . deepest lake in England, next to the highest mountain."" 'Then . he reached into his chalk bag and brought out this box and showed me a . diamond solitaire ring. He bowed down and asked me to marry him,' she . said. Romantic proposal: Angela sporting her new ring and Richard holding the box moments after the couple got engaged (left) and a view of Naples Needle on a sunny day (right) Angela added: 'It was an absolutely amazing feeling. It was full of danger and full of adrenaline at nearly 2,500ft. 'I . shouted out to people climbing on the ridges near to us: ""I’ve just . been proposed to and I just said yes!"" they all cheered and we made our . way down the mountain to celebrate. 'It was amazing. He made me the happiest woman alive - amazing views and an amazing man.' The . pair - who work as education officers - took up climbing together in 2009 and regularly hike across peaks in Lancashire and the Lake . District and have even scaled Wonder of the World Inca site Machu Picchu . in Peru. The couple took up climbing together in 2009: At Machu Picchu (left) and ready for a camping trip (right) But Napes Needle won’t be the venue for the wedding ceremony. 'I doubt we would be able to get a priest up to the top of the mountain to conduct the ceremony for us, but we would love an outdoor shindig on a lovely summer’s day,' Angela says. Napes Needle, which is 20 metres high, is situated amongst the Napes Crags on the southern flank of Great Gable. Left: Richard and Angela (centre) climbing Shepherds Crag Borrowdale; Right: Sharing a cuppa while camping . It was first climbed solo by Walter Parry Haskett Smith in June 1886 and the climb is considered by many authorities to mark the birth of rock climbing as a sport. 'The fact that it's the birthplace of climbing as a sport in the UK and a piece of climbing history made it extra special,' Angela added.","Richard Crabtree proposed to Angela Jones at the peak of Napes Needle .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . She's more at home wearing neon high-vis jackets and steel capped wellies than ball gowns and heels, but that hasn't stopped Katie Stamps being crowned Miss Birmingham. And now after scooping the top beauty gong the 5ft 9in model who works in construction is now heading to the Miss England finals. Katie, 21, from Kidderminster in Worcester, beat off 19 other rivals to take the crown, sending her through to the finals next month.

She decided to enter herself in the pageant to bring a bit of glamour into her life after spending most of her days in temporary cabins on building sites. She said: 'I’m always in hard hats and high-vis jackets. I really love construction and I want more girls to get into it. 'It’s a shame it’s seen as such a man’s world -- I find it very rewarding. Katie beat 19 rivals to the title in her first ever beauty contest - and said . her colleagues had backed her to the hilt . 'I stumbled across the application [For Miss Brimingham] online and thought it looked fun, and decided it would be a good confidence boost to swap my hard hat for high heels. 'I never expected to win. My other half is away a lot so I thought it would be good to do something for me. 'Obviously it was so different from what I am used to. Being in the construction industry isn’t very ladylike and not very glamorous. Katie dolled-up in a ballgown and heels (left) and in her usual work attire -- a high vis jacket and wellies (right) So was she expecting to win? 'When my name was called I was so shocked I couldn’t move,' she admits. 'The other contestants had to push me back out to the stage. I couldn’t believe it. 'People had suggested I tried modelling because of my height but I never pursued it as I’m happy with my current job. The newly crowned Miss Birmingham plans to keep her day job in construction but hopes success awaits at the Miss England pagaent . Katie Stamp, 21, is a natural beauty who is often stuck in a construction office but she glammed up to enter Miss Birmingham, right .

The newly crowned Miss Birmingham Katie said she was shocked when her name was called out as teh winner of the Miss Birmingham . The girls paraded on stage in four outfits: an eco-dress they had made themselves, sportswear, an evening gown and a party dress. Katie was supported on the night by her mum, Alex, 41, and step-dad, Steve Hall, 41, who were in the audience with two friends. Sadly, her boyfriend, Longbridge-based engineer Peter Gibbs, missed her big night because of childcare arrangements. Since she was 17-years-old, Katie has been an office manager for construction company Stepnell. From building site to beauty pageant: Katie wanted the chance to show her glamorous side . The beauty queen, who lives with boyfriend Peter, 33, added: ‘In my job I don’t have much opportunity to look very glamorous but I love being able to get my hair done - it makes a nice change from being on the building site.' Miss England competition director Angie Beasley said: 'It's fantastic news that we're getting girls of this calibre through into the competition. 'I know when I was doing the competitions myself it was all about becoming a model. 'The fact the competition is attracting girls from all different backgrounds is great because is raises the competition and shows that girls want to so much more these days.'

"By . Naomi Greenaway . and Rebecca Evans . To kick off her new career, Kirsty Bertarelli appeared on Madeley on Sunday, Richard Madeley's Radio 2 show and was spotted leaving the recording studio looking relaxed in jeans and a cowboy jacket . Most up-and-coming popstars have a couple of  things in common: they're generally young and struggling for money. But one aspiring perfomer smashes those stereotypes. As Britain's richest woman, the former Miss UK shares a . £7.4billion fortune with her Swiss husband Ernesto, whose family made its money in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. She's also well out of her teens: the billionairess is 41 years old and has three children. To kick off her new career, glamorous Kirsty appeared on Madeley on Sunday, Richard Madeley's Radio 2 show. She was spotted leaving the recording studio looking cool and casual in jeans and a cowboy jacket. The former Miss UK - who went on to take third place in the 1989 Miss World pageant - sang her new track, Indigo Shores, live in the studio. The single will be released on May 12th but is currently available to download on Kirsty's website. On her upcoming tour, Kirsty is preparing to shun . the trappings of wealth. She may be accustomed to private jets and holidays aboard a £100million superyacht, but she has pledged to fly economy, wear ‘off-the-peg’ stage clothes and perform solo gigs as plain old Kirsty B. Staffordshire-born Kirsty has already experienced chart success in Switzerland, where she lives on the shores of Lake Geneva. Crowned Miss UK in 1988, she met Ernesto, an America’s Cup-winning sailor, on the London party circuit. At around that time, she was experiencing some success as a songwriter - her tune Black Coffee became a UK No 1 for the girl group  All Saints in 2000, the year she married. Mrs Bertarelli put her fledgling pop career on hold after her nuptials. But now, 14 years later, she's decided to give pop stardom another go and has recorded an album, Love Is, which includes a duet with Boyzone star Ronan Keating. She insists she is not being bankrolled by her husband, whose grandfather started the multinational drugs company Serono. She said: 'It's probably why he's such a good businessman. He says ""it can't be something that costs huge amounts. It's got to be real."" 'This is not a problem. When I was in Switzerland promoting my music to the radio stations, everyone was amazed I would just travel around with them, in the car, in the van. She added: 'It doesn't bother me. I'm quite happy to be casual and not made up. I can never even remember to put my jewellery on. 'I'm from Staffordshire and I've been very fortunate but I'm the same girl I used to be. I've always been a creative and sensitive person.' Scroll down for video . Economy star: Kirsty will wear 'off-the-peg' stage clothes and perform solo gigs as plain old Kirsty B . Performing: Kirsty sings on stage as she supports Mick Hucknall and Simply Red at a concert almost three years ago . Speaking to the Sunday Times, Mrs Bertarelli, who splits her time between Geneva and a townhouse in Knightsbridge, London, added: 'I'm not wanting to be the new Rihanna or Lady Gaga. I'm just a singer-songwriter.' Despite having more money than, well, every other woman in the country, the 41-year-old mum of three is putting her luxurious lifestyle to promote her new single, seen here leaving the Radio 2 studio on Sunday . She added: 'I don't think Ernesto is going to stop working and rely on my income quite yet but it still feels fantastic to make your own money. 'It feels so much more special to buy a present for my husband. It's important to a woman's self-worth and self-belief to be making some money.'

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Beyonce and Jay-Z have tried it, Natalie Portman's at it, as is songstress Ellie Goulding -- veganism is on the up. But look out Celebvile, there are some sexy new vegans in town. Animal rights charity PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is on the search for the UK's sexiest vegan. Scroll down for video . Nominee: Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough was one of the finalists . Better luck next time: Byron Higgins, 29, from Colchester, gunned for extra votes with the cunning use of a cute baby prop . After stiff competition, they've whittled it down to eight finalists -- four men and four women. Now it's down to the public to decide who should wear the PETA crown. The stunning female finalists come from all corners of the British Isles. Jenna McGuinness, 23, is from Glasgow and says, 'I'm passionate about healthy eating and addicted to vego chocolate bars!'. Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough, describes herself as, 'a cat lady, artist, adventurer and soldier in the karma army'. In the Mancunian corner, Kate Laycy, 33, currently working in London as an actress says, 'I'm an animal loving, green tea obsessed, bikram gal - and a vegan forever!' Whilst her Dundee Rival, Lisa-Marie Williams, 24, hopes and believes that one day all animals will be treated as equals. The men -- Byron Higgins, 29, from Colchester; Seth Taggart, 40, from Brighton; Gareth Lloyd, 27, from Oxford; and Matthew Oakes, 26, from Staffordshire -- are all proud vegans and animal rights advocates too. Lisa-Marie Williams, 24, from Dundee and Jenna McGuinness, 23, from Glasgow are two of the PETA finalists . Seth Taggart, 40, (left) and 33-year-old actress Katey Laycy (right) are also after the PETA crown . Public voting is now open on peta.org.uk and will help PETA determine who they should select as the Britain's sexiest vegans. PETA spokesperson Ben Williamson says: 'Compassion for others is not only a sign of strength but also a big turn-on. 'Everyone who entered this contest is a winner because they know that the best thing that people can do for animals, the planet and their own health is to go vegan.' According to PETA, vegansim is on the up. 'We've had a huge increase in entries this year and there's definitely been more interest in veganism in the UK,' says Ben. 'Bill Clinton, Jared Leto and Al Gore are all vegan, as well as other celebrities, which may have an influence.' Mathew Oakes, 26, (left) and Gareth Lloyd, 27, (right) are among the male finalists . 'And this year the first vegan supermarket, currently a success in Germany, will be opening in the UK too.' 'There are not only ethical but environmental benefits too. The livestock sector is the highest contributor to greenhouse gases -- even more than the transport industry. 'So organisations like the UN are now encouraging a shift towards veganism.' Adopting the 'v' word has also been found to have hugely beneficial effects on our health. 'Food like meat, dairy, eggs and lamb have all been linked to cancer, stroke, heart desease and obesity.' 'Vegans report feeling more energetic and are often lighter.' And judging by these finalists, ditching the meat is great for sex appeal too. You can vote for your favourite contestants online, one female and one male, to help PETA select the winners. The two winners will each receive a night for two and lunch at the Lancrigg Vegetarian Country House Hotel in Grasmere, Cumbria, plus a vegan dinner for two at Cumbria's Zeffirellis restaurant. PETA will choose the winners while taking into account several factors, including vote count and the enthusiasm that entrants demonstrate in promoting their entry and vegan eating. The winners will be announced on 15 April. Are you a sexy vegan? We'd love to hear from you.

A federal judge has lifted a temporary restraining order that had stopped the U.S. military from force feeding a hunger-striking prisoner at Guantanamo Bay naval base, saying the man's life hangs in the balance. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said the military must be allowed to carry out force feeding in the case of Abu Wa'el Dhiab because of the 'very real probability that Mr. Dhiab will die.' Abu Wa'el Dhiab was rapidly deteriorating . and she would not reissue a temporary order from last week that stopped . the military from force-feeding him. Force feeding: A federal judge ordered the Obama administration Friday to stop temporarily the forced feeding of a detainee at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and provide videotapes of past such feedings . Lawyers for Dhiab are challenging force feeding during the hunger strike as abusive. Dhiab's lawyers have argued that the . practice of forcibly extracting him and other prisoners from their . cells, restraining them and feeding them through a tube inserted into . their noses, was also illegal. The Defense Department has said the military only feeds prisoners against their will to keep them alive, and follows all laws when it does so. Kessler says the detainee is willing to be fed at a hospital at Guantanamo Bay if he can be spared what the judge calls the agony of having feeding tubes inserted and removed for each feeding. Take your pick: A U.S. Navy doctor shows off a display of feeding tubes for detainees at the hospital in the Guantanamo Bay. The military routinely force-feeds detainees on hunger strike there . The judge says the Defense Department refused to make any compromise from current procedure. On Wednesday, the judge brushed aside the Justice Department's objections and ordered the government to produce 34 videotapes that show Dhiab being forcibly removed from his cell, followed by force feeding the hunger-striking prisoner. Earlier this week, Kessler said she urged . the government and Dhiab's lawyers to reach a compromise on the . procedure used to feed Dhiab, but that the Defense Department has 'refused to make these compromises.' In her order Thursday night, she said the court will move quickly in the case to consider the merits. Kessler issued the temporary restraining order a week ago. 'The court is now faced with an anguishing Hobson's choice,' Kessler said, in lifting the temporary restraining order. U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered the administration to preserve and turn over the videotapes of the forced feeding of detainee Mohammed Abu Wa'el Dhiab . If she issues another temporary order to stop the forced feeding, Dhiab probably will die, the judge said. Alternatively, allowing the force feeding possibly will result in great pain and suffering, she added. Lieutenant Colonel Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman, said: 'As the court has asserted, this is a deeply complex issue. The Department has long held that we shall not allow the detainees in our charge to commit suicide and it's particularly worth noting here that we only apply enteral feeding in order to preserve life.' Enteral feeding refers to the delivery of a nutritionally complete food directly into the stomach or small bowel of a person suffering from or at risk of malnutrition. Prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay naval base have engaged in hunger strikes for years, but only won the right to challenge in U.S. courts the military's practices of forcing them to eat in February. Dhiab's lawyers are ultimately seeking an order that would force the military to change the practices. On Wednesday, Kessler ordered the government to turn over more than 30 videos of Dhiab's feedings, some of his 2013 medical records, and the protocols the military uses to force-feed prisoners. Former inmates have described a feeding process in which detainees who do not wish to be force-fed are restrained, sometimes violently, and taken to a force-feeding chair . Liquid food supplements are displayed at a feeding chair at the US Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Hunger-striking inmates are often force-fed by tubes, a practice which has been widely condemned by rights groups .","Judge orders Obama administration to stop temporarily a detainee's forced feeding .

"By . Pat Hagan . After the excesses of the weekend, it’s natural to worry about the effects on the body. Now scientists have found Monday is the day we fret most about our health. Research shows health-related Google searches peak on the first working day of the week, with Tuesday scoring almost as high. But as the week wears on, we lose interest in medical matters, according to psychologists at San Diego State University. Health-related Google searches peak on the first day of the month, a study has found (library image) It’s estimated that there are an average of 160 million health-related searches on Google alone every day of the year. Researchers wanted to see if there was any correlation between when we worry most about our health and weekly patterns in sickness. For example, numerous studies suggest heart attack rates spike on a Monday. A 10-year study in Scotland revealed cardiac deaths peak then before hitting a low on Tuesday. Weekend binge-drinking, coupled with the stress of going back to work, is thought to put the heart under added strain. Heart attacks, strokes and high blood pressure all peak early in the week - which scientists say is linked to excess at the weekend (library image) Other studies meanwhile, suggest Wednesday is the gloomiest day of the week – possibly because it is the furthest point from the weekend. The San Diego team analysed internet searches on Google for health on every day between 2005 and 2012. They broke it down as a percentage of overall search volume and found that Monday and Tuesday queries were 30 per cent greater than the rest of the week combined. Searches dropped by three per cent on Wednesdays, 15 per cent on Thursdays, almost half on Fridays and by a whopping 80 per cent on Saturdays. On Sundays, interest in health bounced back slightly – before peaking again on Mondays. In a report on their findings the researchers said the results tally with evidence that blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes and infectious diseases all seem to peak early in the week – a health pattern known as circaseptan rhythms. They said one explanation is that Monday is ‘akin to a mini New Year’s day’, where the excesses of the weekend result in a demand for health information. ‘Poor health choices during the weekend may promote a desire to cleanse come Monday. ‘There is strong potential for improving public health. ‘Health promotion campaigns could immediately be made more cost effective by targeting the population early in the week rather than uniformly across the week.’","Google-related searches peak on the first day of working week, data shows .

"By . Pat Hagan . It may not be what men want to hear as they contemplate putting their feet up at the weekend. But new research shows undertaking do-it-yourself jobs round the house could be the secret to living longer. A study by Danish scientists showed men who broke into a sweat by regularly doing DIY were much less likely to die prematurely than those who sat round the house taking it easy. Men who break into a sweat by regularly doing DIY are much less likely to die prematurely than those who sit round the house taking it easy . Among men aged between 50 and 64, DIY was associated with a 23 per cent decline in risk of death from all causes, according to a report in the medical journal Epidemiology. Britain’s couch potato lifestyle is thought to be storing up an epidemic of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Research out earlier this week showed just 30 minutes of exercise a day could slash high blood pressure - a major risk factor for heart attacks and strokes - by a fifth. In the UK, people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport, running or aerobics every week. Taking part in sports, such as jogging, cuts the risk of dying for women by 25 per cent and for men by 22 per cent . Three out of four Britons fail to achieve this. In . the latest study, scientists at the Danish Cancer Society in Copenhagen . looked at nearly 60,000 middle-aged men and women to see how physical . activity affected lifespan. The volunteers were taking part in a long-term study which recorded their exercise patterns. The results showed that taking part in sports, such as jogging, cut the risk of dying for women by 25 per cent and for men by 22 per cent. Cycling had similar benefits while gardening also promoted a longer lifespan- especially in men. But the study also tracked DIY activity levels in men and found it had a powerful protective effect against premature death. The researchers said taking part in some kind of physical activity was more important than spending hours at it. Their findings did not show those spending more time exercising or doing DIY lived any longer. They said: ‘This could suggest that avoiding a sedentary lifestyle is more important than a high volume of activity.’","50 to 64-year-old men who do regular DIY are less likely to die young .

"By . Damien Gayle . and Reuters . When Leon Gautier landed on Sword Beach in a hail of enemy fire on June 6, 1944 the last thing he expected was that 70 years later one of the 'Boches' he was fighting against would be a friend and neighbour. Yet today, Mr Gautier, now 91, and Johannes Boerner, 88, live side-by-side in the very town where the French commando came ashore in the first wave of the D-Day invasion. They are two of the dwindling number of veterans of the Allies' Normandy landings and the ensuing three-month battle to push German forces back on the western front of Nazi-occupied Europe. Enemies to neighbours: Johannes Boerner, left, 88, and Leon Gautier, right, 91, fought on opposite sides during the Normandy landings in 1944, but they are now friends living in the same town on what was the front line . Time and understanding have forged a bond between the former French elite commando and the German parachutist from Leipzig, who are neighbours in the Normandy town of Ouistreham. In 2012 they celebrated Christmas together and next month both will attend ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day. 'We're like brothers now, it's just great for both of us,' said Mr Boerner, who took French citizenship in 1956 after marrying a Norman woman. It is one of the vagaries of history that both men live today in the same town where Mr Gautier landed on D-Day, Tommy gun in hand and a year of training under his belt. He was one of Commander Philippe Kieffer's 177 French soldiers who battled the machine gun fire, landmines and barbed wire of Sword Beach as part of No. 4 British Commando. Changes: Mr Borner, who fought with the elite 2nd Fallschirmjaeger (parachute) unit, poses with his war-time photo. News of the landings set he and his comrades on a 220-mile march from Brittany to Normandy . Mr Gautier poses outside the number 4 Anglo-French commando museum at Ouistreham. He remembers how a surge of adrenaline kicked in as he and his fellow commandos reached the beach by the town . Besides the unforgettable sight of the . armada of boats filling the sea, Mr Gautier recalls checking and . rechecking his weapons just before landing, and how the photo of his . wife Dorothea in his pocket got 'a little wet'. 'It was OK, though, I fixed it later,' he said. 'I still have it.' German . shells rained down on Mr Gautier and his comrades even before they . reached land, but months of training and a surge of adrenaline . outweighed fear of the 'Boches', the derogatory term the French used for . German soldiers. 'Commander . Kieffer had told us what would happen to us: ""It's possible that not . even 10 of us will come out alive"",' said Mr Gautier. Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st Special Service Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on SWORD beach on D-Day. Mr Gautier was one of 177 French soldiers who fought as part of No. 4 British Commando . Bloodbath: Free French and British soldiers regroup on Sword beach after the initial landing . News of the surprise amphibious attack - along with those by U.S., Canadian and British forces on the now-legendary beaches of Utah, Omaha, Gold and Juno - roused Mr Boerner from his sleep far away in Brittany. The invasion set him and the rest of the elite 2nd Fallschirmjaeger (parachute) unit on a 220-mile march to Normandy to shore up German defences and try to break the Allied bridgehead. 'The night of the 6th of June we were woken up with an alarm - ""The Allied troops are landing in Normandy!"",' said Mr Boerner. 'We left for Saint-Lo, but we went on foot - 350 km.' Mr Gautier and Mr Boerner were never in the same place at the same time in Normandy, but they share memories - the impenetrable hedgerows that snared tanks and hid snipers, hearing the voice of the enemy just feet away, the mosquitoes that infested the flooded valleys, the small green apples that were too sour to eat, and the smell of human corpses rotting in the heat. Well prepared: Mr Gautier is pictured third from left during his year-long training in Scotland . Fleeing Saint-Lo on July 17, Mr Boerner and his unit began a series of retreats, finding themselves eventually trapped in the 'Cauldron', the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, where they were encircled by Allied forces. 'The approach to Falaise was horrendous. They were all around us with their tanks, especially their planes, they just didn't let up,' said Boerner. 'There were bodies everywhere ... there were 10,000 dead on the approach to Falaise.' Hungry, lice-ridden and demoralised, Mr Boerner and his comrades from dispersed German units rifled the pockets of dead soldiers for cigarettes or food. 'We had nothing left. Our uniforms were dirty, in tatters ... How were we going to get out of this?' On August 21, after days of aerial and artillery bombardment, and unable to escape eastward through a narrow gap the Germans dubbed 'the corridor of death', Mr Boerner was taken prisoner by the Canadians. He was one of the lucky ones - of his original company of 120 men, only nine survived. General Dwight Eisenhower later wrote in his memoirs: 'Falaise was one of the greatest killing grounds of the war. 'It was literally possible to walk for hundreds of yards at a time, stepping on nothing but dead and decaying flesh.' Mr Gautier points at his July 14, 1943 wartime photo as he visits the number 4 Anglo-French commando museum. Deployments in Britain, France and even Cameroon preceded a permanent move home to France . For Mr Boerner, PoW camps and forced farm labour were his life until 1947. with the Leipzig of his youth in ruins and under Soviet control, he decided that his new chapter would find him right where he already was - in Normandy. Mr Gautier was shipped back to Britain after three months of fighting in Normandy, one of only 25 French commandos to escape death or wounding in the Battle of Normandy. Deployments in Britain, France and even Cameroon preceded a permanent move home to France for a career as a claims adjuster. After retirement, he moved to Ouistreham and, while paying a visit to a restaurant in the town, the Chateaubriand, met its owner, Mr Boerner. A book about the two men, Ennemis Et Frères (Enemies And Brothers) by Jean-Charles Stasi, was published in 2010. Mr Boerner, his living room decorated with a cuckoo clock and beer steins, still has a full head of hair and the same gentle look that he had in his eye when he was photographed in his Luftwaffe uniform at the start of the war. 'I hope we never see another war like this because it's just not possible ... The young men, the young men on the front there, shooting machine guns, it's just not possible. Freedom and peace, that's all I can tell you.' Mr Gautier thinks about the flowers that he'll be laying on his fallen comrades' graves next month. 'For the young people - they need to know all about this,' he said. 'It cannot happen again. We have to be vigilant.'","Leon Gautier, 91, and Johannes Boerner, 88, live side-by-side in Ouistreham .

"By . Reuters . Magma levels are slowly rebuilding inside Mount St. Helens, a volcano in Washington state around 100 miles south of Seattle, that erupted in 1980 and killed 57 people . The roughly 8,300-foot volcano erupted in an explosion of hot ash and gas on May 18, 1980, spewing debris over some 230 square miles and causing more than a billion dollars in property damage. U.S. scientists say there is no sign of an impending eruption and the volcano has been quiet in recent years. Looking out: Recent analysis of Mount St. Helens shows that the volcano remains active and has accumulated additional magma, but there are no signs of an impending eruption . Entire forests were crushed and river systems altered in the blast, which began with a 5.2 magnitude earthquake. Within minutes, the north face of the symmetrical peak collapsed, spewing volcanic ash and unleashing rivers of hot  mud and scorching pumice that obliterated everything in their path. The violent eruption lasted nine hours, causing catastrophic damage to the surrounding area and claiming 57 lives. 'The magma reservoir beneath Mount St. Helens has been slowly re-pressurizing since 2008,' the U.S. Geological Survey said in a statement on Wednesday. Monitoring: Since the end of the 2004-2008 eruptions at Mount St. Helens, scientists at the Cascades Volcano Observatory and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network have been monitoring the subtle inflation of the ground surface and minor earthquakes . 'It is likely that re-pressurization is caused by (the) arrival of a small amount of additional magma 4 to 8 km (2.5 to 5 miles) beneath the surface.' The USGS said this is to be expected with an active volcano and does not indicate 'the volcano is likely to erupt anytime soon.' Helicopter pilot Major Jeffrey R. Linscott recalls flying into the volcano before it erupted in 2004. He says the volcano is monitored by GPS telemetry and seismic systems as well as other sensors that tracks carbon dioxide and thermal temperatures. 'I flew into the crater and noticed the same area we had landed the previous day was fractured. It was a startling and troubling observation,' Linscott told CBS News. Discovery: This photo of a simmering Mount St. Helens was taken five weeks before the May 1980 eruption . 'The monitoring stations measured a deformation in the flanks of the volcano as the magma was raising to the surface. Not long after that, the volcano erupted.' 'This is giving long-term (data) that it's getting ready to erupt again, but it could be decades before it does something again,"" Moran said. ""It's getting ready, but it's not there. The reassuring thing is: when it's really ready to erupt, it gives lots and lots of signs.' The USGS, and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at University of Washington, closely monitor ground deformation and seismicity at the volcano. This summer, they will also measure its released gases and gravity field, measurements that can be used to monitor subsurface magma and forecast eruptions.","There are no signs of an impending volcanic eruption on Mount St. Helens .

"By . Jane Flanagan In Cape Town . South African President Jacob Zuma has been ordered to re-pay some of the 14million pounds tax payers money used for a lavish upgrade of his private home. A damning report by the country’s top anti-corruption official described improvements at the residence used by Mr Zuma, his four wives and more than 20 children, as an 'unconscionable and excessive misappropriation of public funds'. The report is the result of a two-year probe into a controversy which is largely responsible for a dramatic drop in the popularity of the 71 year old president, who was booed spontaneously by thousands of mourners at a memorial service for Nelson Mandela, in December. South Africa's public ombudsman said that non-security upgrades at President Jacob Zuma's private residence which cost the taxpayer $20 million were unlawful and he must repay part of the costs . The 400 page report by South Africa’s Public Protector concluded Mr Zuma had profited personally and acted 'unethically' during the process of upgrading his personal homestead, which saw neighbours being evicted to make way for facilities including a swimming pool, a visitors’ centre, helipads, football pitch and amphitheatre. An earlier internal government probe into the renovations had found that the works were essential for the president’s security. In plans, the swimming pool was described as 'a fire pool' required in the event of a blaze at the largely-thatched residence. The controversial homestead of South African President Jacob Zuma in Nkandla, which through extensions caused neighbors to move and unnecessary additions to be made under allegedly false claims . The report said that the president had inappropriately benefited from state funding but that he had done so by mistake, rather than intentionally violating the ethics code of his office . Yesterday’s eagerly-awaited report, entitled ‘Secure in Comfort’, established that while a personal clinic and house for police officers might reasonably form part of a security plan. However, the amphitheatre, visitors’ centre and extensive new facilities for the Zuma family’s chickens and cattle could not. The scandal, known as ‘Nkandla’ after the nearest town to the sprawling property, has sparked massive resentment at the lifestyle enjoyed by the President and his extended family while millions of South Africans continue to live in poverty, despite the end of apartheid 20 years ago.

"By . Jane Flanagan In Cape Town . OSCAR Pistorius shot through a car sunroof at  a traffic light after a  confrontation with police, his ex-girlfriend told his murder trial. The Olympian was furious after an officer took his Glock pistol and emptied its chamber after the car – in which Pistorius was a passenger – was pulled over for speeding, the court heard. Samantha Taylor, a model who was also a passenger in the car, said the police had spotted his gun lying on the car seat and told him it ‘couldn’t just stay there’. Scroll down for videos . Back in court: Oscar Pistorius checks his mobile phone in the dock before the start of the fifth day of trial . Stress: Pistorius reacts while listening to evidence about the night he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . Strain: The Paralympian covers his ears while studying his notes as he returned for what could be another day of harrowing testimony from witnesses about his girlfriend's death . Testimony: One of the athlete's former girlfriends told the court how he carried a gun with him 'all the time' when they were dating . She added: ‘Oscar got angry.  He shouted at the policeman because he was not allowed to touch his gun.’ After . the confrontation with officers was over, the car pulled away and . Pistorius re-loaded  the weapon, letting off a shot through the sunroof . around 15 minutes later. The . driver of the car was Darren Fresco – the friend pressured by Pistorius . to take the blame in another shooting incident that was relayed to the . court earlier in the week. Miss . Taylor told Pretoria High Court that the double amputee carried a gun . ‘all the time’ during their relationship, which began when she was 17. He kept one under his bed and on the floor with his prosthetic legs at night, she added. Tough to hear: The athlete's ex-girlfriend painted a picture of him as an unfaithful boyfriend who was prone to fits of anger and went everywhere with his gun . Range of emotions: The sprinter was forced to listen to intimate details about his past relationships in court . Laid bare: Miss Taylor described some of Pistorius's habits while they were dating, including what side of the bed he always slept on at home and where he kept his gun during the night . Strain: Miss Taylor's observations of what Pistorius did when they were together show different traits from what the Olympic athlete says he did on a later night when he shot Miss Steenkamp . Miss . Taylor painted a picture of a man who was frequently angry, raised his . voice, kept multiple mobile phones and was unfaithful. The . witness wept repeatedly as she described their turbulent romance, which . began in 2011 and ‘ended when he cheated on me with Reeva Steenkamp’ – . the girlfriend he is alleged to have shot on Valentine’s Day last year. Her . evidence about the shooting incident in the car relates to firearm . offences that Pistorius has denied, which are in addition to the murder . charge he is facing. Miss . Taylor described another incident in which Pistorius had brandished a . gun to threaten the driver of a car that he believed was following them . home. ‘When we arrived . at his estate, he jumped out of the car with his gun and held it to . someone’s window and then they drove away,’ she said. Listening to testimony: The athlete - known as Blade Runner - sits in the dock with his family behind him . Greeting: Pistorius shakes hands with a member of the African national congress women's league in court . Emotional: The Paralympian's sister Aimee (front centre) shows the strain that the trial is taking . Support: Blade Runner's sister Aimee (left) and uncle Arnold (right) sit with other relatives in the public gallery . During . cross examination, the double amputee’s lawyer, Barry Roux, put it to . Miss Taylor that Pistorius could sound like a woman when he raised his . voice in anxiety. She . disagreed and told the court that she had heard the athlete shout at her . ‘sister, best friend, another friend, and his best friend’ and ‘he . never sounded like a woman’. The . fifth day of the trial also heard testimony from a security guard who . had received reports of gunshots coming from Pistorius’s house and had . phoned the athlete, only to  be told that ‘everything is fine’. Pieter . Baba, who had greeted Miss Steenkamp, 29, at the gate of Pistorius’s . exclusive estate only hours before her death, had got through to the . athlete on his mobile phone. ‘Mr . Pistorius said to me “security, everything is fine”,’ Mr Baba told the . court. ‘That’s when I realised that Mr Pistorius was crying,’ he added. Discussions: The sprinter shows his sister Aimee something on his mobile phone in the courtroom in Pretoria . Tensions: Unidentified friends of Reeva Steenkamps's family appear to glare at Pistorius during the trial . Scene shot: A TV monitor shows a picture of the street where Oscar Pistorius lives . Embrace: Pistorius hugs his sister Aimee, who has been in court every day this week . Conferring: The 27-year-old Olympian talks with his uncle Arnold in the courtroom . Done for the weekend: Pistorius leaves court at the end of the fifth day of his trial which has adjourned until next week . Many by now will know Oscar Pistorius's tough-talking lawyer Barry Roux who has been tearing into witnesses in a bid to discredit their stories. But a lesser-known member of his legal team is 24-year-old Roxanne Adams who has been assisting Mr Roux build the case for the defence. She has been sitting in front of the Paralympian throughout the trial and is sometimes seen deliberating with Pistorius as he leans over the dock. Currently a candidate attorney for a South African law firm, she certainly has aspirations of filling Mr Roux's shoes one day if her Twitter account is anything to go by. Her page is full of motivational phrases such as: 'Do everything with passion, push yourself to your absolute limits and you will succeed in everything you do.' Another post says: 'Believe in urself & have faith in ur abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in ur own powers u cannot be successful or happy.' The . athlete then called back Mr Baba, who told the court: ‘He just started . crying over the phone. That’s when the line went off again.’ The guard then drove to Pistorius’ house and saw him coming down the staircase with his mortally-wounded girlfriend in his arms . ‘I saw Mr Pistorius coming down with Reeva.

"By . Kate Lyons . An AFL club in Melbourne is being investigated after allegations that club officials made players as young as 17 run around an oval naked to punish them for a losing streak. An official complaint was made to the East Burwood Rams club about the naked run, which allegedly occurred on May 22 at an evening training session, by parents of players. It is believed the nude run was punishment for the team's disappointing season – they have only won one game so far. The East Burwood Rams AFL club is under investigation after claims that club officials forced players to run naked around the oval at a training session (file photo) The Age reported that some players in the team, which competes in the second division of the Easter Football League, were as young as 17. Parents of the players complained to the club, who reported the incident to the Eastern Football League, who are now investigating it . The Eastern Football League is investigating the incident after they were contacted by the club over the weekend. Phil Murton, CEO of the EFL said the investigation may take a week or more, given the number of people they need to talk to. 'We know there is an allegation that something occurred, we're trying to get to the bottom of what occurred,' he told MailOnline. 'The club alerted us to the incident on the weekend, we're talking to players, coaching staff and anyone else.' Fabian Carrelli, who was brought on as coach of the senior team last year declined to comment on the incident, but in the most recent edition of the club newsletter, Rampage, he expressed his frustration at the performance of his team. 'A very disappointing result in a game we should have won as we let another game slip where we had control for a majority of the contest. 'Kicking with the breeze in the 2nd, we wasted too many opportunities and didn’t capitalise on our forward entries on what was to be a wasteful qtr of footy by our boys. 'It was all downhill for the remainder of the quarter as Bayswater slammed on 9 goals in what I thought was our worst 25mins of footy since my arrival at the club. Enough said!"" East Burwood president Sue Bailey said the club would not comment on the incident. 'I've got nothing to say, all comments are to go through the EFL,' she told MailOnline.","East Burwood Rams AFL club under investigation for incident at training .

"By . Daniel Mills . He has made a name for himself bedding tourists in Bali, now it looks as though Australia's self-proclaimed sex addict Todd Gisondi is looking to turn his sex life into a money spinner. The man, who critics are giving a spray back home for ruining Australia's reputation abroad, is taking his self-proclaimed sexual exploits one step further in a move likely to outrage Aussies even more. The mother of the Bali-based expat, who stars in reality TV series What Happens In Bali, has waged into her son's controversial and unemployed lifestyle by convincing the 25-year-old to work the corners of Kuta's party district as a gigolo - searching for tourists 'looking for a companion whilst in the land of gods.' Sex addict: Tod Gisondi is on the path to becoming a gigolo courtesy of an advertisement from his mother which sells him as 'Anthony, Athletic and well built' The former rugby league player and Newcastle resident is now living a life of leisure on the tourist circuit in Bali's Kuta district . Already copping blasts back home for lines such as 'girls feed off anything I say', this latest stunt will shock viewers as the man who considers himself 'a f***ing handsome devil' goes to air on Channel 7 tonight. Gisondi, 25, is originally from Newcastle but up and fled to Bali after splitting with his long-time girlfriend. He says he has slept with more than 100 women since making the move four months ago, and on the program claims to never come home from a night out without a woman. 'I'm 100 per cent gonna go home with someone,' he says. It is claims such as this which has lead his mother to convince him to work as a pimp, and Gisondi wants to charge his clients up to $100 an hour for his services. Referring to himself on the program in the third person, Gisondi says: 'Mum's a bit worried about precious Toddy.' So, she's like 'you know you're sleeping with all these girls, how about you start getting paid for it Toddy?.' The job description paints him as an part Australian, part Italian stallion whom ladies looking for a good time would be hard pressed to refuse. 'Ladies in need of a companion whilst in the land of gods, I'm an Australian with Italian origin, 25-years-old now living in Bali,' it reads. It is the solution, his mother claims, to keeping him out of trouble and preventing him from getting girls pregnant. The 25-year-old checks himself into a sex clinic, a prerequisite required of  gigolo's to ensure they have a clean bill of health . Gisondi has copped a spray back home for his sexual exploits on the show What Happens In Bali . The ad goes on to describe Gisondi, best known for picking up women using his dog Tito and for acts constituting sex with two or more women at one time, as 'athletic, tanned, well built, well educated and well spoken.' It advises that 'all areas of discretion are assured' for women wishing to sleep with 'Anthony,' the pimp pseudonym his mother chose. Those he perceives fortunate enough to sleep with him  will pay just $100 an hour for his company. 'Mate, I'm gonna have to pop some Viagra to pump out an hour,' he says. It's a sure fire way to russle some of the feathers of the Australian public who haven't taken well to Gisondi's overseas antics. 'Disgusting television. Todd is vial and his attitude to women is appalling,' Ellie Thomas wrote on the program's Facebook page. 'Obviously there are no female producers because any self respecting woman would not let this trash air.' Meanwhile Kevin Stewart wrote: 'It seemed to be an interesting show, right up to the point you introduced Todd, then it became ""A W**ker in Bali"" and it got that way I stopped watching it.' Kylie Atkinson said: 'He was such a tool, I couldn't stand him. Why did they devote so much time to this idiot? This is not a documentary!!' Working his charm: Gisondi's dog Tito is a sure fire way the 25-year-old picks up women . That email: The moment Tod's mum decides he should take a job working as a gigolo under the pseudonym 'Anthony' And they're also unlikely to be charmed by his visit to a Bali sex clinic - describing to the doctor his sexual activities when asked how many times he has used a condom. 'None. Maybe once, but I took it off,' he says. Asked if he ever questions his partners about their own sexual history he says 'I usually have sex with them and leave. I don’t really talk to them after it. I’m just like `see you later’. But his mother has vowed to defend her son against any criticism. 'Ha ha omg that was good lol you look so cute son ha ha yeh yr copping it on the shows site, I will get my gloves on for u xxx love you,' she wrote on Facebook after the first program aired. 'Full support to the prince of poppies lol… yeh love his guts lol funny as all fark.' There are two main ways he trawls for women – walking up and down the beach with his dog Titto or going out drinking in Poppies Lane in the party district of Kuta. The rugby player - who only targets tourists, never locals or expats - uses his dog to break the ice, and has a very specific system for scoring girls. He gets a 'cat conversion' if he succeeds in taking a girl home before midnight. He gets a 'double double' if he gets a cat conversion and then goes out and finds another girl to take home. But apart from his self-proclaimed sexual expertise, the Australian expat also counts rapping as among his aspiring talents. He goes by the name of The Prince when he's performing on stage.","The Australian, 25, stars in new reality TV show What Happens In Bali .

"By . Cindy Tran . More than half Australian households are struggling to stash cash away each month while more than a third don't have $1000 cash on hand. A survey of 1,500 households found 54 per cent were not saving and claimed they were going backwards in their finances, savings, loans, credit or equity and felt they couldn't raise $1000 if there was a financial emergency. As well as the lack of cash and savings, employees also listed low wages, moderate job prospects, rising unemployment and a lack of job security were rated as one of the biggest concerns, according to ME Bank's biannual Household Financial Comfort Report. Scroll down for video . The survey found 10 per cent of households were not saving and going backwards in their finances, savings, loans, credit or equity and feel they couldn't raise $1000 if there was a financial emergency . The high rise in households lacking cash savings is the biggest in three years, while only 46 per cent reported the ability to save each month. ABC . reports savings rates jumped to double-digit after Lehman Brothers . collapsed, and have remained around 10 per cent since, even as interest . rates were cut to record lows to encourage more spending. The bank's economic's consultant Jeff Oughton told ABC that not only are many people struggling to put money aside, a large group do not have savings built up to meet an 'unforeseen large expense.' 'Of the order of 40 per cent are breaking even at the end of each week and another 12 per cent are actually overspending and drawing on their savings,' he said. Meanwhile, with record low interest rates, even those who are financially stable saw 17 per cent are expected to rely on their own savings during self-retirement. Meanwhile, with record low interest rates, even those who are financially stable saw 17 per cent are expected to rely on their own savings in self-retirement . The report found 25 per cent of young singles and couples are more likely to fund their own retirement, while 23 per cent expect to rely on the government pension. The survey also found men put away more fund for their own retirement than 14 per cent of women. Mr Oughton said the study shows older households with more assests have typically fared well in the current low interest rate environment. 'The financial comfort amongst the asset rich households has risen to record levels thanks to rising share and house prices,' he said. 'The best example there is the financial comfort of self-funded retirees - that's up 8 per cent to 7.8 out of 10, the highest of any household segment.' He said the federal budget had a major negative impact on how people rated their financial position over the year ahead. '67 per cent of households expect their financial situation to worsen during the next financial year because of the federal budget,' he said. The report also found 45 per cent of Gen X are most likely to focus on paying off their mortgage, while working single parents and students were likely to be saving for a raining day.","54 per cent of Australian households are unable to save each month .

"By . Reuters . and Ap . The U.S. power sector must cut carbon dioxide emissions 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels under federal regulations unveiled on Monday that form the centerpiece of the Obama administration's climate change strategy. The Environmental Protection Agency's proposal is one of the most significant environmental rules proposed by the United States, and could transform the power sector, which relies on coal for nearly 38 percent of electricity. It also set off a political backlash likely to run well into next year. Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator, said on Monday that between 2020 and 2030, the amount of carbon dioxide the proposal would reduce would be more than double the carbon pollution from the entire U.S. power sector in 2012. Scroll down for video . Big change: The EPA officially unveiled a plan Monday that will force power plants to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030 . States will have flexible means to achieve ambitious but attainable targets, regardless of their current energy mixes. States which rely heavily on coal-fired power plants are thought to have the toughest tasks ahead. 'The flexibility of our Clean Power Plan affords states the choices that lead them to a healthier future. Choices that level the playing field, and keep options on the table, not off,' McCarthy said in remarks at EPA headquarters on Monday. The plan had come under pre-emptive attack from business groups and many Republican lawmakers as well as Democrats from coal-heavy states like West Virginia before it was unveiled. But the 645-page plan looked less restrictive than some had feared, with targets easier to reach because emissions had already fallen by about 10 percent by 2013 from the 2005 baseline level, partly due to retirement of coal plants in favor of cleaner-burning natural gas. The plan . gives states multiple options to achieve their emission targets, such as . improving power plant heat rates; using more natural gas plants to . replace coal plants; ramping up zero-carbon energy, such as solar or . nuclear; and increasing energy efficiency. States can also use measures such as carbon cap-and-trade systems as a way to meet their goals. Share . prices for major U.S. coal producers like Arch Coal, Peabody Energy and . Alpha Natural Resources closed at or near multi-year lows on Monday. Bullying? Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy gestures during an announcement of the plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, states reliant on carbon-heavy coal and coal-fired power plants are pushing back . Short sighted? U.S. President Barack Obama is photographed through the window as he speaks on the phone in the Oval Office during a conference call hosted by the American Lung Association to find ways to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. The new EPA rules ushered in Monday will continue to affect power producers long after he leaves office . Monday's rules cap months of outreach by the EPA and White House officials to an array of interests groups. The country's roughly 1,000 power plants, which account for nearly 40 percent of U.S. carbon emissions, face limits on carbon pollution for the first time. Climate change is a legacy issue for President Barack Obama, who has struggled to make headway on foreign and domestic policy goals since his re-election. '[A] dagger to the heart of the middle class.' - Senator Mitch McConnell . But major hurdles remain. The EPA's rules are expected to stir legal challenges on whether the agency has overstepped its authority. A 120-day public comment period follows the rules' release. The . National Association of Manufacturers, a long-time EPA foe, argued on . Monday that the power plant plan was 'a direct threat' to its members' competitiveness. The . electric utility industry, encompassing plants that use resources from . coal and natural gas to wind was more circumspect about the plan. 'While . the 2030 reduction target is ambitious, it appears that utilities may . be allowed to take advantage of some of their early actions,' the Edison . Electric Institute said. Lawmakers representing big coal states lashed out. Mitch . McConnell of Kentucky, Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, termed the . rules a 'dagger to the heart of the middle class' that would damage the . economy. Republicans . are trying to wrest control of the Senate from Democrats in November's . elections. Four of the states with Senate seats in play are among the . top 10 coal producers nationally: West Virginia, Kentucky, Montana and . Colorado. Obama, . on a conference call with public health groups, said Americans' electricity bills would shrink, not rise, as the rules spur investment . in new technologies. A large dozer sits ready for work at Peabody Energy's Gateway Coal Mine near Coulterville, Illinois. Many in states like Illinois, where coal is a major player in state jobs and energy, are lashing out at the new rules they say unfairly affect coal reliant states . The EPA's McCarthy also forecast that the regulations could yield over $90 billion dollars in climate and health benefits. Soot . and smog reductions that would be achieved through the plan would . translate into a $7 health benefit for every dollar invested in the . plan, she said. The . EPA estimates that reducing exposure to particle pollution and ozone . could prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and as many as . 3,300 heart attacks by 2030, among other impacts. The . rules, when finalized, could give Washington more clout in . international talks next year to develop a framework for fighting . climate change. The United States is eager for emerging industrial . economies such as China and India to do more to reduce their emissions. Lashing out: Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Republican leader in the U.S. Senate, termed the rules a 'dagger to the heart of the middle class' that would damage the economy. McConnell's state is one of the top coal-burning states in the U.S. STATES MOST RELIANT ON COAL FOR ELECTRICITY . KENTUCKY: Not surprisingly, the proposal is widely unpopular in Kentucky, which gets 92 percent of its electricity from coal — more than any other state except West Virginia — and is the nation's third-largest coal producer. 'Why keep chopping the legs out of your own economy to fight a world problem?' asks Gary Whitt, a railroad worker whose job depends on coal shipments. INDIANA: Gov. Mike Pence and a state manufacturers' group say the plan would cost Indiana — which generates 80 percent of its power from coal and is perched atop a gigantic vein — jobs and business growth while boosting ratepayer costs that are among the nation's lowest. Purdue University researcher Doug Gotham says replacing aging coal-fired plants with natural gas burners will help. STATES THAT PRODUCE THE MOST COAL . WYOMING: Fighting the feds is nothing new in a state participating in a dozen lawsuits against the Environmental Protection Agency over air emissions. Gov. Matt Mead says he's reviewing the proposal and will 'fight for coal' if necessary. Wyoming leads the country in coal production with nearly 40 percent, and Wyoming Mining Association director Jonathan Downing says it can be a clean energy source. WEST VIRGINIA: Democrats and Republicans may agree on little else in the No. 2 coal-producing state, which also gets almost all its power from coal, but opposition to the EPA plan is bipartisan. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin says none of the state's coal plants is close to meeting the proposed standard, although companies say they're cutting emissions. STATES REQUIRED TO MAKE THE BIGGEST CUTS . WASHINGTON: The plan demands a 72 percent cut in coal usage, a far higher rate than any other state. But it helps that in this hydro-rich state, just 3 percent of electricity is coal-generated. Gov. Jay Inslee praises Obama for his leadership on carbon pollution, while officials note that a voter-approved law requires the largest utilities to get more power from renewable sources. SOUTH CAROLINA: State government and power companies say the federal order to cut coal emissions by 51 percent is surprisingly harsh. But more than half of South Carolina's power comes from nuclear plants and that will increase after two units under construction go online. LEADING USERS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY . COLORADO: The administration describes Colorado as a poster child in the push to cut carbon emissions, praising its requirements for utilities to step up use of renewable energy sources; the state gets 11 percent of its power from wind. But coal remains the biggest electricity provider, and the plan seeks a 35 percent cut by 2030. CALIFORNIA: Coal is a bit player in the most populous state's energy portfolio, so few are complaining about the EPA order to reduce emissions by 23 percent. California gets more power from wind, biomass, geothermal, hydro and solar than from coal, and its providers are required to generate one-third of their electricity from renewables by 2020. 'While others delay and deny, the Obama administration is confronting climate change head-on with these new standards,' Gov. Jerry Brown says.","The Environmental Protection Agency proposal is one of the most significant ever in America and could transform the power industry .

"By . Cindy Tran . Children as young as six are encouraged to attend school daily to see positive NAPLAN results in the long run, according to a new study. The research found academic achievement on NAPLAN had become worse as attendance rates are high in primary school and fall away sharply during high school. Students who skip a large amount of school days for family holidays, sick days or general absences may not have the opportunity or resources to catch up on missed classes. Academic achievement on NAPLAN had become worse as attendance rates are high in primary school and fall away sharply during high school, a study has found . The research - delivered at the Australian Council for Educational Research's annual conference on Monday - found that a small amount of absence from school may have minimal effect on academic performance. But beyond some threshold attendance level, there is noticeable drop in measured academic performance. Kirsten Hancock, a researcher from Telethon Kids Institute said parents are encouraged to understand the value of regular school attendance for their children. 'Children learn their habits early so if they are taught that they need to 'show up' for school and make that commitment from a young age then they will carry that positive mentality for the years ahead, not only at school but throughout their careers and life generally,' she said. 'We wanted to know how many days of absence kids could 'get away with' before it started to affect how they were doing in at school. The answer was none. 'We also found that the effect of missing days accumulated over time, so that school absence not only impacted in the year, in which the days were missed but in the future years as well.' Students who skip a large amount of school days for family holidays, sick days or general absences may not have the opportunity or resources to catch up on missed classes . Sydney Morning Herald reports the study dispels the common belief there is a safe level of absence students can get away with before their grades will suffer. 'We were able to show that actually every day counts and days that you're missing in year three and year five can detect that all the way through to year nine,' the reports co-author and University of Western Australia Professor Stephen Zubrick said. 'A 10 day period of unathorised absence in a year is sufficient to drop a child about a band in the NAPLAN testing. 'For most children, year one sets the pattern for what school attendance will look like in the future.' Despite all concerns on school attendance, Cabramatta West Public School teacher Mathew Halloran said the concern with children missing school should be how it affects their total school learning, not just the NAPLAN results, which is a one off test every two years. 'Attendance is important for students' welfare and learning the total curriculum,' he told Daily Mail Australia.","The NAPLAN tests is the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy for all students across years three, five, seven and nine .

One in 10 Australians have admitted they would tell a joke about an Indigenous Australian and one in five would avoid sitting next to an Aboriginal person on public transport, new research shows. BeyondBlue have today launched the Invisible Discriminator, an Australian-first campaign to highlight the psychological effect that subtle racism has on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and reduce discrimination. The organisation says subtle acts of discrimination, negative stereotypes, racist jokes or making insensitive or offensive comments still impact on the lives and well being of Indigenous Australians. Scroll down for video . BeyondBlue have launched an Australian-first campaign to highlight the psychological effect that subtle racism has on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders . The new campaign will broadcast ads of non-Indigenous Australians engaging in these types of acts. BeyondBlue found that up to four out of five Indigenous people regularly experience racism and almost one third experience high or very high levels of psychological distress, which causes anxiety and depression. A survey commissioned by BeyondBlue of more than 1,000 non-Indigenous Australians found nearly half believe Indigenous Australians are given unfair advantages by the government, more than a third believed they 'are sometimes a bit lazy' and many think it's acceptable to discriminate. One in five Australians would avoid sitting next to an Aboriginal person, according to a study commissioned by BeyondBlue . The organisation says subtle acts of discrimination, negative stereotypes, racist jokes or making insensitive or offensive comments still impact on the lives and well being of Indigenous Australians . BeyondBlue chairman Jeff Kennett said racial discrimination contributes to these tragic statistics and it's about time things changed. 'This research shows that racism in Australia is still common and that many people engage in racist behaviour,' he said. 'Racism, like any form of discrimination, leads to distress, which in turn can lead to depression and anxiety. Indigenous Australians are twice as likely to die by suicide as non-Indigenous Australians, and we are almost three times more likely to experience psychological distress.' BeyondBlue found four out of five Indigenous people regularly experience racism . BeyondBlue CEO Georgie Harman said the ads would represent the voices inside the heads of some non-Indigenous Australians. 'This campaign challenges everyone to put themselves in someone else’s shoes and ask how they would feel if they were treated with suspicion, laughed at and avoided. The best way to reduce harm caused by subtle racism is to stop it, and if you see it happening, call it,' she said.
