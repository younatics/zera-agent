"A camera firm has designed virtual reality headgear . that can beam digital . images into real-life environments. Called Mixed Reality, the device projects a 3D image from a computer screen, for example, into any real-life environment. Wearers are then able to walk around the 3D projection as if it were real and see it at all possible angles. So, for example, users could look at a projection of something as small as an ant - and be able to walk around it. Or, they could download an image of a landmark from Google Maps and then take stroll. Scroll down for video . Japan-based camera maker Canon displayed a prototype model of its handheld Mixed Reality goggles at the annual Virtual Reality Expo in Tokyo. The device projects a digital image from a computer screen into real-life environments. Wearers can walk around them as if they were real and see them at all possible angles . Canon's Mixed Reality device, pictured, puts visual markers into real-world environments to provide orientation. These markers are plotted using the head-mounted displays. Each display has a digital camera attached and these cameras send the markers to a software program that calculates the required angle . Although the technology uses the basic principles of augmented reality - a view of the real-world layered with computer-generated sound or images relevant to what the camera is being point at - Canon claims its Mixed Reality technology is the first to allow wearers to see the augmented images from any angle. The system uses visual markers that are put in the real-world environment to give the wearer and the object orientation. These markers are plotted using the head-mounted displays on the Mixed Reality device. Each display has a small digital camera attached that sits next to each of the wearer's eyes. These cameras send these markers to a software program that is able to calculate what angle the user is looking at. The Mixed Reality device, shown here being tested by a visitor to Canon's stand during Tokyo's Virtual Reality Expo, is set to go on sale to businesses such as interior designers,  manufacturers and surgeons by the end of June but it will only be made available in Japan . Using a prism built into the Mixed Reality headgear the view of the projected device changes shape and size as the wearer moves around it . As the wearer moves, the images on the display panels move so that they align with their point of view. This changes the angle at which they are looking at the 3D projection. This process is done almost simultaneously so that the virtual world lines up with the real one and includes scaling and resizing. The system runs on Windows 7 and Windows XP. Although the technology was first announced back in 2010, the company showed off the device at the Virtual Reality Expo in Tokyo this week and said it will start selling the platform from the end of this month. Canon added it will sell the product to businesses such as manufacturers and interior designers as well as doctors to be able to simulate surgical procedure in Japan, in the first instance. A consumer version is a possibility but Canon has not confirmed if or when this will happen, nor did it announce the price, or when it will be made available abroad. The key device for Canon's Mixed Reality technology is the head-mounted display which is fitted with a Charge Coupled Device video camera. This camera captures video images from real space, and a display device that overlays computer graphics images onto these captured real video images. The images from the small display are enlarged using the same principle as a magnifying glass. Using a three-sided prism, the surface on one side is used for both total reflection and light transmission, causing the images to be refracted and reflected four times. This works because the surfaces on all three sides are neither flat, nor are they a sphere with a central axis. It's a special shape that makes sure the viewed image is displayed clearly and not distorted or blurred at the edges due to aberrations in the optical system. Part of the surface includes an undulated curved surface that makes appropriate corrections for any aberrations. A camera is positioned in front of each the left and right eyes so that the image from the right-hand camera is shown on the right-hand display, and the image from the left-hand camera is shown on the left. In the head-mounted display the centre of the image is aligned with the centre of the user's field of vision. Canon uses this to create spatial depth.","Canon's Mixed Reality headwear  can beam digital images into real-life environments .
The images appear in 3D to the scale they've been designed for .
Wearers can then walk around the projections and see it at different angles as if the item was actually there ."
"A mother-of-two was today being investigated by police after saying she hoped some of the hundreds of people who drowned off the coast of Italy were Muslims. Housewife Nicky Hutt was branded a racist after posting the slur on Facebook following the tragedy last Thursday, which saw 232 African immigrants die in a desperate bid to reach Lampedusa, Sicily.

Mrs Hutt - who has two children aged two and seven - said she had been drinking when she posted the comment, and had just watched a documentary on last month’s mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya. Her Facebook post sparked outrage among the Muslim community, with leaders branding Mrs Hutt's comments ‘disgusting’ and ‘upsetting’. Majid Yasin, director of the Bournemouth Islamic Centre and Central Mosque, said: ‘Anyone who makes such comments about the desperate people who had died must have a heart of stone. ‘This is disgusting. If she said it about Jewish people or Christians I would be upset.’ Adnan Chaudry, chief officer for the Dorset Race Equality Council, added: ‘To see those comments is very disturbing. ‘This is a tragedy for which Italy held a national day of mourning, which shows the sympathy and empathy for these people. Post: Mrs Hutt - who has two children aged two and seven - said she had been drinking when she wrote the comment, and had just watched a documentary on last month's mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya . ‘People have to be really desperate to put their lives in danger as they did in this disaster. I don't know how someone could make those comments.’ Mrs Hutt said: ‘Last Friday I had drunk some alcohol and had just watched a documentary about the Jihadist Kenya massacre. I posted an article on Facebook which regrettably offended some good and decent Muslim friends of mine. 'I genuinely regret the original posting which does not reflect my normal view about my Muslim friends' Nicky Hutt . ‘I would like to make it clear that the post was deleted by me within only one hour of its original posting. I also posted an apology over the weekend. I genuinely regret the original posting which does not reflect my normal view about my Muslim friends.’ Mrs Hutt's hairdresser Esra Turay, herself a Muslim, said: ‘These racist remarks are really upsetting. ‘It's wrong to have these extreme views. It just does not add up - she is nice to my face but she obviously hates . Muslims.

The vile rant, in response to Mrs Turay sharing Mrs Hutt's comments on her own Facebook page, read: ‘How dare you post something from my page. It's called freedom of speech in my country okay. ‘I can post what the f*** I like. I'm sorry it's come to this. And yes, my opinions are extreme. But that's my decision. Not yours to broadcast. 'I can post what the f*** I like. I'm sorry it's come to this. And yes, my opinions are extreme. But that's my decision' Nicky Hutt . ‘That was f***ing out of order. If you were that disgusted you should have just deleted me, not did what you did.' Mrs Turay, from Bournemouth, said: ‘I'm not trying to start a war at all, I just want peace, but racism like this has to be exposed. She is my client and I didn't want it to come to this but it is offensive to read comments like this. ‘She said publicly she was sorry and that she had been drinking the night she posted the remarks but then she sent me a nasty text message that proved she isn't sorry. Extreme views like this need to be stopped.’ Mrs Hutt told MailOnline she would not comment further.

Ms Laws said Allen employed staff to look after the children, but involved himself in some of the work duties including working at the homes at night and was 'a regular and formidable presence'. Miss Laws said boys at the homes described Allen as being 'abusive' and said at times he was violent and was often under the influence of alcohol. One of the Wrexham care homes which John Allen owned and ran and where he abused children in his care . John Allen pictured arriving at Mold courts during his 1996 trial - he was today found guilty of more offences . She told the court the victims felt they had 'no choice' but to put up with Allen's attentions as they became 'hardened to the abuse'. Giving evidence during the trial, Allen claimed he had no sexual interest in young boys and said he thought the complainants were after compensation in the wake of the publicity of his previous convictions.

"A white bus driver's . story that a religious book in his shirt pocket blocked bullets as he . was attacked by three black men isn't supported by evidence and testing, . Dayton police said Wednesday as they closed the case, which had been . investigated as a possible hate crime. Bus driver Rickey Wagoner's story that a religious book in his shirt pocket blocked bullets as he was attacked by three black men isn't supported by evidence and testing . Rickey . Wagoner, 49, told police he was outside his city bus Feb. 24 when men . assaulted him. He said that two bullets hit the inch-thick book . containing Bible verses and that one hit his leg and that he was stabbed . in the arm, according to a police report. The report also said Wagoner . told police he grabbed the gun and shot at the fleeing men. Wagoner had told police that the assailants were black and that he thought the attack might have been a gang initiation. According to the New York Post, Wagoner called a 911 dispatcher stating: 'I've been hit in the leg. My chest feels like I've been hit with a sledgehammer.' He later told police that one of the alleged attackers had told another that he needed to 'shoot a polar bear... if you want to be all the way in the club.' 'Polar bear' is a term for a white person, the supposed use of which gave the FBI reason ton investigate Wagoner's story as a potential hate crime. But his account wasn't found to be factual, Police Chief Richard Biehl said at a news conference. 'This . assault, as reported, is not true, not accurate,' Biehl said. Police . did not say Wagoner made up the story and didn't explain why he would . have made the report. Biehl did say it appeared Wagoner owed on back . taxes. A recording at a phone listing for Wagoner said the voice mail could not accept more messages. No . criminal charges have been filed. But the Greater Dayton Regional .

"A British doctor working in Sierra Leone has described the horror he and his team have witnessed since the deadly Ebola outbreak struck. Dr Oliver . Johnson, along with a team of British medics, was working to strengthen the health system in the country's capital Freetown when the . crisis took hold earlier. When disaster struck, they decided to stay and 'do everything they could' to help - despite health workers being among those most at risk of contracting the virus. Today, Dr Johnson, 28, described the crippling conditions the team work in - and the opposition they face from locals who believe the disease may be a government conspiracy. Scroll down for video . Dr Oliver Johnson, from London, was already in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, before the Ebola crisis  began. He and his team were working to build and strengthen the health system in the country's capital. Today he described the horror the disease has caused . He said: 'We're all aware that there is a risk and that we have to be . extremely careful. However, we also know that if we wear the protective . equipment properly and follow the protocols then we'll be OK. 'That doesn't leave room for error, however - such as an accidental scratch of the face or forgotten hand wash. 'As we get used to it, we all begin to relax - the risk then is making sure that you don't cut corners or get too confident.' But he admitted the working conditions wearing the suits were far from anything the team had experienced before. 'I . first wore the protective suits during a bit of an emergency, so didn't . have much time to reflect on it. 'The heat of the suits is quickly . overwhelming, as your goggles steam up and you feel the sweat dripping . underneath. And the smell of chlorine is intense.' Dr Johnson, 28, is working in Freetown . as part of the King's Health Partners scheme. The initiative is a . partnership between Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital and . South London and Maudsley Trusts as well as King's College London. He added: 'What shocking is how healthy the patients look before they die and how quickly they decline. 'A . number of the Ebola patients I've seen look quite fit and healthy and . can be walking around until shortly before their deaths.' Dr . Johnson also described the difficulties of working in the country - . which is recovering from years of brutal civil war - because many . thought the illness was a government conspiracy. Deep fear among patients and their families saw some trying to escape hospital, he said. 'Ebola . is a new disease in Sierra Leone and when the first cases emerged, many . people thought it might be a government conspiracy to undermine certain . tribal groups, steal organs or get money from international donors. 'This links to widely held scepticism about Western medicine and traditional beliefs and practices. 'Relatives . don't get to see what happens to patients when they are isolated, so . some expressed fears that they were being taken away to be killed by . doctors. 'They don't get to see the good facilities and great care that patients I see every day receive. 'That meant some patients resisted being isolated and would try to run away or be carried off by family members. 'This . is a constant challenge even now, and presents real ethical dilemmas . about whether we can or should restrain patients - and logistical ones . about how it's even possible to safely restrain an infectious patient . without putting yourself at risk.' He admits he 'definitely hesitated' when he was first confronted with a probable case . of Ebola (it takes a few days to get lab confirmation). Where a victim has breaks in the skin, blood seeps out, as the disease takes hold. The virus has a death rate of up to 90 per cent, and is highly-contagious, spreading through contact with an infected person's blood, secretions, organs and other bodily fluids . 'Your . instinct as a doctor is to rush in and help, but you know you can't . touch a patient until you're fully protected, he explained. The first symptoms include a fever, headache and sore throat . . Within days as the Ebola virus attacks the immune system, chronic abdominal pain, muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhoea take hold . . The virus pierces blood vessels causing bleeding from the eyes, ears, mouth and other orifices . . The whites of the eyes turn red and blood blisters form under the skin . . Ebola is highly-infectious and has a death rate of up to 90 per cent . 'Our families are often very concerned, and convincing them that we'll be okay can be hard.' Before the . outbreak swept the country Dr Johnson, from London, had worked with . African colleagues to help prepare for the worst - advising how to . identify cases, set up isolation units, how to protect staff and . providing refresher training for local health workers. When . cases started to emerge, the team had to ask themselves whether or not . they should stay in the country to help with the response - their . initial mission was to help strengthen the health system, not to provide . a humanitarian response to an epidemic. The . team is made up of two consultants, two junior doctors, two nurses, a . pharmacist and a hospital manager are all staff and volunteers. They . chose to stay and help local health workers. Dr . Johnson said: 'From the moment we heard about the first Ebola cases, . all of our instincts on the team here and back in London were to do . everything we could to help our colleagues overcome this new challenge. 'We . have very close relationships with our colleagues at Connaught and the . Ministry of Health and always try to respond to their requests for . support. 'It . was also clear that this new threat was something that they hadn't . faced before and would require technical advice, extra manpower and . trusted friends. 'We're . not a humanitarian non-governmental organisation however, so of course . we then had to go through the process of articulating this and agreeing . it as a group - there was never opposition though and we've always had . consensus.' Latest figures from the World Health Organisation show the outbreak of the deadly virus in western Africa has infected more than 1,300 people . Latest figures from the World Health Organisation show the outbreak of the deadly virus in western Africa has infected more than 1,300 people and killed at least 729. Ebola has no vaccine and there is no cure. The outbreak has centred on Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. There has also been particular concern after densely populated Nigeria reported what is thought to be its first death from the disease. The team have been based at Connaught Hospital in Freetown for the last 18 months. They were initially working to help strengthen the health system of the country through improving aspects such as training, health policy, research and hospital management, before the first cases of the deadly virus started to emerge in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia. Dr Johnson said that it was hoped that the country had 'dodged a bullet' - but Sierra Leone confirmed its first ever case of Ebola on May 25. 'Even as the outbreak spread to Liberia there had been some hope that it might pass us by,' he said. 'We've now been hit hard though. Initially the disease was relatively well contained in the east but we've now seen cases in 1 districts. Hopefully these are isolated cases, but it's still a bit early to tell for sure.'

"The huge array of hidden cameras used by a top doctor to spy on colleagues and patients in hospital toilets emerged yesterday. Voyeur Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh was jailed for using 23 secret cameras to film his victims, including James Bond-style devices disguised as memory sticks, pens, watches and hearing aid boxes. He also fixed tiny cameras to toilets, bins and sinks and even filmed visitors to his £750,000 home. Over more than three years, world-renowned hearing specialist Yeoh – who worked in NHS and private hospitals – amassed thousands of hours of footage of more than 1,000 men, women and children. Scroll down for video . A clip of Lam Hoe Yeoh installing a secret recording device at a hospital in Sutton. His perverse campaign of voyeurism was discovered when he accidentally filmed himself on one of the James Bond-style hidden cameras he rigged to watch his victims on the toilet . Depraved NHS consultant Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh, 62, spent three years filming more than 1,000 patients, colleagues, friends and even children as young as three in intimate moments . Judge Warwick McKinnon at Croydon Crown Court condemned Yeoh's 'nefarious and despicable actions' as pictures of the high-tech devices he used in his perverted spying were released by police . The consultant surgeon’s downfall came after he inadvertently filmed himself putting a camera in a communal toilet at the private St Anthony’s Hospital in North Cheam, South London. The incriminating footage was found when the device fixed by Blu-Tack fell off and was spotted by a colleague. Yesterday married Yeoh, 62, of Banstead, Surrey, who pleaded guilty to voyeurism on Tuesday, was given an eight-year sentence at Croydon Crown Court. It comprises a five-year jail term and three years on extended licence after his release during which he will be supervised in the community. He can be returned to prison if he breaks the terms of his licence. Afterwards victims said they had been left feeling dirty and violated by his abuse. One former colleague, who asked to be called Sarah, said the experience had changed forever the way she behaves in public. ‘I can’t go to the toilet in a public place now without looking for hidden cameras,’ she said. Sarah, 33, worked with Yeoh for ten years and was filmed by him between 15 and 20 times without her knowledge or consent. Once she found a pager belonging to him in a communal toilet at work and, assuming that he had innocently left it behind, returned it to his office. She now believes the device was left deliberately to spy on her. Sarah added: ‘It’s strange watching him in the dock, people say he looks broken but how remorseful can you be after it’s been going on for so long? Police found 23 covert cameras, which were disguised as computer memory sticks and pens . The cache of secret cameras also included three hidden in hearing aid boxes in his car . ‘It felt good to stand there with some of the other victims – it was a real strength in numbers.’ Another woman, who worked with Yeoh for 12 years, said he made 47 videos of her. She said: ‘He spliced videos of me talking and laughing with videos of me using the toilet where we worked.’ Recalling the moment police asked her to watch the videos back to identify herself she added: ‘I felt frozen. I felt dirty as though I had been raped by him. I felt disgusting. ‘I knew the only way I could be free of him was to face him in the dock and see him vulnerable and small, just like he made me feel.’ The doctor, who is originally from Malaysia and boasted that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon star Michelle Yeoh was his half-sister, bowed his head throughout the hearing, shielding his face and refusing to look at his victims. Sentencing Yeoh, Judge Warwick McKinnon condemned his ‘nefarious and despicable actions’ and said he had disgraced the hospitals where he worked. He said: ‘The breach of trust is vast and far reaching as well as the distress, sense of betrayal, anger, and disgust at the appalling breach of trust, at the personal and intrusive nature of your actions. ‘Your actions brought the establishments you worked in into disrepute.’ A James Bond style spycam concealed in a watch was also discovered by officers . NHS consultant Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh, 62, is pictured peering out of his prison van after he was jailed for five years . In what police described as calculated and clearly orchestrated actions, Dr Yeoh had invited people to his home to secretly film them in the bathroom. He carefully labelled and edited his footage, some of which was of children as young as three, and stored it on his NHS computer for his sexual gratification. Yeoh, an expert in tinnitus, vertigo and dizziness who is also known by the first name Robin, was arrested at St Anthony’s Hospital after an investigation by police in April. On Tuesday he admitted seven counts of voyeurism, six of making indecent images of a child and one of possessing extreme pornography relating to 32 identified victims and a further 1,084 who have not been identified. His wife Ivy, 57, had a voyeurism charge against her dropped. Yeoh has been based at the NHS St Helier Hospital in Carshalton where he ran a regular clinic. In addition to St Anthony’s, he has worked at the private Cromwell Hospital in Chelsea and the Portland in Central London. He is an honorary senior lecturer at St George’s medical school in Tooting, South London, and has given expert evidence in cases at the High Court. Yeoh has admitted using a sophisticated network of cameras hidden in hospital toilets to spy on 1,000 patients including children at St Anthony's hospital . The voyeurism charges relate to 30 identified victims and 1,084 unidentified victims, while the charge of making indecent images of children relates to six children . Colleagues of the voyeur doctor told of their horror yesterday at discovering he had been secretly filming them for years – and even giving some video clips a star rating system. Three women, who worked at a top private hospital, said Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh's actions had left them feeling 'violated'. They also told in excruciating detail how they had to watch Dr Yeoh's videos to identify themselves. In them, he had edited together clips of them chatting to him at work with clips of them using the toilet. The women were told in April that Dr Yeoh had been arrested but it was not until October that they found out they featured in his videos. One victim, in her forties, said: 'He would write a name then a brief description on each video. Some descriptions we didn't understand because it was your name and then, for example, five stars next to it. Apparently that was how on show you were. It is so surreal and shocking, it is hard to actually believe it.' Describing how she had to watch the videos with two policemen, she said: 'I felt shocked, traumatised and then very sick. 'I could not finish watching the video. I was not prepared for what I saw. I think there were 43 videos of me, in the office, on the toilet. When the police left I felt disgusted. I felt dirty. I was utterly disgusted. I wanted it to go away.' Another victim, in her thirties, said: 'You have lots of emotions – if you use public toilets, you look around a bit more. 'You should feel comfortable doing that. I don't work there any more but I don't think I could return.' The two women who have returned to work said they found it 'very difficult'. 'When we returned to work, we found the Blu-tack he had used to fix the cameras,' said one. 'Luckily the toilets where he filmed are being refurbished now.' All three women described Dr Yeoh as 'creepy' and 'socially awkward'. The woman in her forties, who had worked with Dr Yeoh for 12 years, said: 'I was absolutely convinced from the very beginning [that I was one of his victims] because of his very creepy behaviour. He would come into my office many times and would stay in the office on his own after I had left and I was thinking, 'what is he doing on his own in the room for two minutes?' ' The three women were among 19 of Dr Yeoh's victims who were in court yesterday. One said: 'It did help. He was in a vulnerable position – the roles were reversed.'","Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh  secretly filmed hundreds of patients including children .

"The PR executive who was summarily dismissed after her racist Tweet sparked a revolt on social media has apologised - as her own father called her a ‘f****** idiot’. Justine Sacco said that she was ‘ashamed’ over her actions and said she had been ‘cavalier’ in making her tasteless joke about the AIDS crisis in Africa . But her father, who has not been publicly named, was more forthright and said that what she did was ‘unforgivable’. Flying into the storm: This photo, snapped by Twitter user Zac_R, was taken as Justine Sacco got off a 12 hour flight at Cape Town airport after arriving from London. The PR representative would have just been discovering the furor her racist Tweet had created while she was in the air . He also apparently backed the campaign to name and shame his daughter as, in an ironic twist, it emerged he moved his family from Cape Town to the US in 1994 to escape racism at the end of Apartheid. Sacco is now thought to be holed up with her family in South Africa and will be spending Christmas coming to terms with her sudden ascent to the Internet's public enemy no.1. Losing her job as a communications director could also mean losing her US work visa -potentially forcing her to leave America. Sacco was fired by IAC, a major US media company which owns Match.com and Vimeo, after she sent the Tweet as she was about to board a 12-hour flight from London to Cape Town. It read: ‘Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just Kidding. I'm White!' The post was retweeted over 3,000 times and was picked up by media outlets around the world, however Sacco remained completely unaware of it all because she was in the air. The blonde publicist was pictured arriving in Cape Town looking shocked and talking on her phone. Moments later the offending Tweet and Sacco's Twitter account disappeared - and IAC announced it had fired her. Now she has apologised in a statement released to The Star, a South African newspaper. It read: ‘My greatest concern was this statement reach South Africa first. ‘Words cannot express how sorry I am, and how necessary it is for me to apologize to the people of South Africa, who I have offended due to a needless and careless tweet. ‘There is an AIDS crisis taking place in this country, that we read about in America, but do not live with or face on a continuous basis. Unfortunately, it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand. ‘For being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation, but which terrifies us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus, I am ashamed. Justine Sacco has no idea her offensive tweet made the news because she is on a flight to Africa . Career suicide: IAC says that they will take 'appropriate action' against the tweet sent by Justine Sacco (pictured above in shots from her Facebook account) with the high powered executive likely to lose her job . ‘This is my father's country, and I . was born here. I cherish my ties to South Africa and my frequent visits, . but I am in anguish knowing that my remarks have caused pain to so many . people here; my family, friends and fellow South Africans. I am very . sorry for the pain I caused.’ Twitter . user Zac_R, who lives in Cape Town, had been so astonished by the story . when it erupted he went to the airport to meet Sacco where he spoke to . her family. He Tweeted: . ‘Justine's dad is apologeti & basically in tears.""I decided to raise . her in the US. SA was too racist"". Oh, the irony!’ Zac_R . also said that Sacco’s father did not seem racist and claimed he said: . ‘I'm so incredibly ashamed of her. She's a f****** idiot’.

You most certainly can: This tweet Sacco wrote in January may have been a self fulfilling prophecy . The hashtag '#hasjustinelandedyet' was trending on Twitter around the world at the time as thousands awaited Sacco's response. As . Sacco’s Tweet went viral on the Internet she blasted for being . 'outrageous' and 'inappropriate', with titles like 'Worst Tweet of the . Year' stacking up against her. Before . confirming they had fired her - and with Sacco still in mid-air - IAC . released a statement condemning her behaviour as 'outrageous and . offensive'. 'This is an outrageous, offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of IAC,’ said the statement. ‘Unfortunately, . the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but . this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action,' a . representative from IAC told the International Business Times. IAC later announced she had been dismissed. In an ugly twist, Sacco herself is now being subjected to racism herself on Twitter. Amongst . the many brutal Tweets which were sent her way was one from a user . calling themselves Beyonce Supreme who wrote: ‘B**** I HOPE A GORILLA . RAPE U’. In-flight internet service provider Gogo was also forced to backtrack after trying to cash in on the row. On . its official Twitter account Gogo wrote: ‘Next time you plan to tweet . something stupid before you take off, make sure you are getting on a . @Gogo flight! CC: @JustineSacco’ When . users complained that such a comment was ‘shameful’ the company made . things worse by saying to one user: ‘With inflight connectivity the full . story would have already been out there.’ Only when Gogo’s first comment had been retweeted 1,000 times and branded ‘weak and exploitative’ did it change its mind. What a mess: Sacco will have some explaining to do for her sloppy behavior on twitter . The . next Tweet read: ‘@JustineSacco,apologize for response to your . tweet.Right or wrong,It’s not our policy to engage on these subjects.We . clearly need a review.’ Sacco’s blunder led to scrutiny of not just her racist Tweet, but Tweets she had written before.In . February 2012 she wrote: 'I had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night.' Then . about 12 hours before the racist Tweet, she wrote: 'Weird German Dude: . You're in first class. It's 2014. Get some deodorant' -Inner monologue . as I inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.' However it was 'joke' about Africa and AIDS that caused the commotion. Twitter user Stephanie Be wrote in response: 'WOW! Reinforce the ignorant American stereotype much?' John M. Becker tweeted: 'Are you even real?!? This is utterly ghastly on so many levels.' Josephine Baker wrote: 'listen, homegirl is about to be FIRED.' Huffington . Post stated that there is a possibility that the young PR executive's . account may have been hacked. However that is unlikely as her twitter . profile has a number of other tweets that may also be deemed offensive. Sacco wrote: 'I can't be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?' Sacco . also wrote: 'I like animals, but when it's this cold out I'll skin one . myself for the fur' and tweeted the comment directly at PETA, a famous . animal rights organization.

"An FBI spokeswoman says two special agents have been shot by a man in St. Louis County and that the incident isn't directly related to the Ferguson protests rather, the suspect is accused of murdering his mother.

Scroll down for video . Suspect: Major Washington, 33, allegedly shot two FBI officers who were trying to arrest him after he allegedly murdered his mother Donna Washington while burglarizing her home . FBI agents injured: News of the shooting comes after a second night of rioting in St. Louis but the incident was allegedly not related to the neighboring protests . The scene: The shooting, which took place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of Ferguson, was not related to the protests over the police shooting of a black unarmed teenager . At around 3:15 am.m. one agent was shot in the shoulder and the other agent was shot in the leg. Wu says neither injury is life-threatening. 'The incident is not directly related to the Ferguson protests,' Wu said, but did not elaborate further. Shortly after the shooting, which took place about 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of Ferguson, authorities from several agencies lined the scene.

"The axe has been reinvented for the first time in 8,000 years with a new curved blade which is designed to stop momentum immediately on impact. Retired air traffic controller Heikki Karna from Finland designed the bizarre looking Leveraxe which can cut an individual piece of fire wood with just one swipe. But users don’t have to worry about using the axe with too much force like with conventional axes, which don’t stop on impact and can cause injuries. Scroll down for video . The newly designed Leveraxe, the first reinvention of the axe since the Stone Age 8,000 years ago . Heikki Karna, left, the Finnish inventor of the Leveraxe. He developed several prototypes before the Leveraxe was finalised . This is because the curved design of the Leveraxe stops the axe’s momentum when it strikes the wood, reducing the risk of injury. Mr Karna came up with the idea of the Leveraxe, the first redesigned axe since the Stone Age, when he began clearing trees to build a new home in the forest. During the arduous task his axe swung dangerously close to his legs on several occasions. Thinking of ways to make his work safer and easier, he began to develop numerous prototypes which resulted in the creation of the Leveraxe. The red coloured axe head is made from steel and weighs a little over four pounds . The axe's centre of gravity, which isn't directly above the blade but to the side, means it automatically comes down at an angle . Mr Karna, who lives in a remote forest near Helsinki, said: ‘Everybody who has tried splitting wood with a traditional axe knows that it takes a lot of power to penetrate and split the wood. ‘The Leveraxe allows you to easily and safely start splitting suitably sized logs from the sides by striking closer to edges. A prehistoric stone axe, which hasn't changed much in 8,000 years until the invention of the Leveraxe . ‘Now, there is no need to split the log in two first - you can just chop away.’ The red coloured axe head is made from steel and weighs a little over four pounds. Its centre of gravity, which isn't directly above the blade but to the side, means the axe automatically comes down at an angle to split the wood. People wielding the axe are advised to hold the 3ft long handle loosely when bringing it down for the best results and to also avoid sore hands. It costs £158 and has been patented around the world. Mr Karna added: ‘The international interest has been so big that I have run out of stock. ‘There will be some delay until I have new axes available as the production is nearly all hand made. ‘I have ordered new stuff, but I cannot get it immediately and there is a three month waiting list at the moment for new customers.’","Heikki Karna designed the Leveraxe which can cut wood with just one swipe .

"A DIY store employee's Christmas lights use so much electricity he's afraid to put the kettle on. Hobbyist Wayne Skinner and his family are facing an extra £500 on their bills this year - but say it's all worth it to raise money for the local air ambulance. Dozens of neighbours gathered in Bolsover, Derbyshire, for the big switch-on at the two-bed semi-detached home where the 26-year-old lives with his parents John and Susan. Scroll down for video . Deck the halls! Hobbyist Wayne Skinner and his family are facing an extra £500 on the bills for their semi-detached home in Bolsover, Derbyshire - but say it's all worth it to raise money for the local air ambulance . The dazzling display includes glowing Santa figures, doves with flapping wings, and bells which sound as if they're ringing thanks to a synchronised soundtrack. Mr Skinner, who trained as an electrician and works in the electrical department at Wickes, said: 'The lights are sequenced in time with the music with special software and it's all controlled via two control panels. 'We don't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we've got the lights on because it's an old house and an old supply, and we don't like putting too much power on it. 'So we boil the kettle, pour it in a flask and have a flask of hot water while the lights are on.' The display, in its 12th year, takes seven weeks to assemble and costs a fortune - including £150 for a control panel, £150 for software and another £600 for a control board shipped in from the U.S. Electrician: Mr Skinner, 26, making the finishing touches to his glowing teddies. He has spent thousands on the displays, including £600 for a control board which had to be ordered from across the Atlantic . Mr Skinner said: 'We don't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we've got the lights on because it's an old house and we don't like putting too much power on it. So we boil the kettle and pour it in a flask' In many previous years it cost more than it raised, making an average of around £300 a year. But last year the donations rocketed to around £850, and Mr Skinner said he had high hopes for this year's event. 'We get more and more visitors as the word gets round and it's becoming more popular,' he said. Mr Skinner's mother helped switch on the lights this week dressed as Santa in a sleigh pulled by two shire horses. It took six and a half hours to program just one song, DIsney's Frozen, to play in time with the lights. Even if it's raining onlookers can still watch the display from their car, as it's being broadcast on FM radio. Ordinary home - extraordinary lights: The family house even broadcasts the soundtrack on FM radio . Then and now: Mr Skinner (right) was inspired as a toddler by the Blackpool Illuminations (left) There is also a pixel matrix screen which Mr Skinner built, a 'reindeer-cam' which beams the scene into the Skinners' front room and seven other cameras. Mr Skinner was a toddler when he became obsessed with Christmas lights after seeing the Blackpool Illuminations. It sparked a life-long hobby - and some of his display even includes lights once used in the seaside town. 'I've always wanted to get a job working on the Blackpool Illuminations but I think they only employ people who live nearby, so I decided to make my own', he said. 'It's a nice thing to put a hobby into making people smile, making people happy and raising money for charity at the same time. 'It's a win-win, everyone benefits really'.","Display in Bolsover, Derbyshire, costs Wayne Skinner £500 in electricity .

"What is it about airplanes that makes good manners fly out of the window? Whether it's stealing an armrest, pulling up your knees and resting them against the chair in front or refusing to acknowledge your neighbour for ten hours - we behave uncharacteristically un-British when air born. Research by travel search engine kayak.co.uk proves what we've long suspected. Scroll down for video . Forgotten art: Research says we behave badly on flights so here's a manners expert's lesson in Jet-iquette . The OnePoll survey questioned more than 1,000 UK travellers and found 16 per cent of us admit to dispensing with pleasantries and ignoring their neighbour during a flight, with eight per cent pretending to be asleep to avoid any kind of exchange at all. The research says that 10 per cent of us snub our time-honoured love of queuing to overtake when boarding to get a better seat on the plane and 55 per cent of us see red when the person in front reclines their chair without asking. Fly nice: The survey found that  we dispense with pleasantries and ignore neighbours during flights . Other top irritants, according to the poll, are overly chatty passengers, rudeness to cabin crew, eating smelly food, snoring and misbehaving children. To realign our sense of propriety, etiquette expert and author William Hanson gives us his jet-iquette guide to being the perfect plane passenger, and how to deal with ill-mannered neighbours: . 1. The Armrest Hogger . Ah, the age-old armrest dispute. Think of it as a seat divider, rather than an armrest and problems will ease. Inch your way in by placing just your elbow on it, which will leave plenty of space for your greedy neighbour to use it for their elbow – then everyone's a winner. Armrest hogger: There's always room for two. Inch your way in by placing just your elbow on it . 2. The Chatterbox . If your neighbour strikes up conversation, engage for a short while – it won't hurt you; they are only being friendly. We Brits find it difficult to be honest and direct but don't be afraid to say, 'I'm so sorry to be so anti-social but I'm just going to shut my eyes for a while' or words to that effect. Chatterbox: William Hanson says 'it won't hurt' to engage them for a while then tell them are going to sleep . Snuggler: The best etiquette to deal with a sleeping personal space invader is by coughing to wake them up . 3. The Snuggler . It's really quite flattering that the stranger next to you thinks of you as snuggle-material when they fall asleep. But one must respect personal space boundaries, especially in confined spaces. Cough repeatedly to jolt them out their slumber, they won't cuddle up to you again if they think you're harbouring germs. 4. The Chair Recliner . Sadly, the only way to deal with a Chair Recliner is to be one yourself – if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Just make sure you recline your seat once the meal service has been completed. Also, a glance behind to check that they aren't using the tray table for a laptop or children's colouring book is also sensible and gives a subtle yet polite warning to the person behind. Chair recliner: Flight fire with fire on this one and recline your seat but check behind first with a quick glance . Snorer: Invest in a good pair of earplugs to drown them out rather than impolitely elbowing them in the ribs . 5. The Snorer . The ultimate solution to deal with the noisy sleeper would be to invest in a good pair of earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones. Many of us dream of employing a more unorthodox method: a sharp elbow to the ribs, but in reality the only way to combat the snorer is to block out the sound. 6. The Aisle Seat Snoozer . You find yourself needing the toilet during the flight but are faced with an awkward human obstacle. In the event of this happening, you are left with one option only: gently tap the sleeping offender on the shoulder and ask them to move. Under no circumstances must you attempt to clamber over the person, as it's likely you will disturb them anyway and be caught in an uncompromising straddle position. Aisle Seat Snoozer: Under no circumstances  attempt to clamber over the person which will look uncouth . 7. The Merry Flyer . Should you have a tipsy passenger near you, heed this warning: avoid any eye contact at all costs. Any direct exchanges with the intoxicated individual and you may land up with an enemy on your hands at 30,000 feet – or even worse, a new best friend. It's much wiser to alert the staff rather than try to intervene yourself. 8. The Surly Cabin Crew Member . Nobody likes a brisk flight attendant, but confrontation in front of others will only make matters much worse. If you have an issue, quietly ask to speak to the cabin manager or, better still, write a firm letter once home. Merry flyer: Avoid eye contact with tipsy passengers. Alert staff rather than intervening yourself . Feral children: Statistically you are bound to come across feral children on pretty much any flight . 9. The Feral Child . Statistically you are bound to come across feral children on pretty much any flight. If there's space, ask the cabin crew if you can move seats to get away from the little rug rats. If not, those earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones are proving to be a sound investment indeed. 10.The Seat Kicker . Should the darling youngster behind be incessantly kicking your seat, simply turn around with a nice smile, and very politely ask if they would mind stopping. Resist temptation to show your distress – children act up more if they if they sense vexation in adults.","A survey by kayak.co.uk found passengers are ill-mannered on flights .

"Global animal lovers are up in arms over a teenage Texas girl's love of killing big African game, so much so that they're even demanding she be banned from posting pictures of herself smiling alongside her trophies online. Nineteen-year-old Kendall Jones claims photos of dead hippos, elephants, lions and other beasts on Facebook are a testament to her hunting skills and dedication to game preservation. But critics are appalled by the teen's beaming social media and are calling Kendall sick and depraved for killing the rare animals and boasting about it online. Scroll down for video . Conserving by killing? 19-year-old Texas cheerleader Kendall Jones really likes to kill rare animals in Africa. While she pays for her legal hunts, her critics says she's not the conservationist she claims to be . Loves to hunt: Jones faces criticism over her claims that she's a conservationist. The Texas Tech cheerleader's smiling poses alongside dead rare African animals have won her particular ire . An online petition to force Kendall to remove her page because it promotes animal cruelty had gained over 40,000 signatures in just a week. 'For the sake of all animals,' reads the petition as it implored animal lovers to sign, 'especially the animals in the African region... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal!' Jones, whose Facebook indicates she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' maintains she is doing what's best for the preserves, where there isn't always space for even threatened species like elephants or lions. 'Controlling the male lion population is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes. 'Funds from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their property.' Jones's photos show her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she's killed. One particular photo, in which she's posing alongside a an extremely endangered rhinoceros, has her critics especially steaming, but the Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well. 'The vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino population through conservation,' she wrote. Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion) Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals . Hugs! Here Jones poses with the near threatened African leopard after one of her hunts, which she describes as 'fair chases' Hungry: Jones defends her killing of elephants by saying their meat goes on to feed hundreds of thankful village families . However, Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a white rhino, which number around 20,000. 'The first animal I ever shot was a White Rhino with a .416 Remington!!' the teen writes on her Facebook page. Because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be banned from hunting in Africa completely. family pride: Jones first learned to love the hunt when she started following her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9 . 'Harvest': 'Another harvest for today,' wrote Jones with this photo. 'White springbok, it's 1 of the 4 color shades of this animal! And let me tell you it's one of my favorite kinds of meat so far!' A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that. 'Kendall Jones is an American born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting African wildlife under the facade of conservation,' reads the petition. It continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.' Critics say the 19-year-old is not conservationist and is simply reaping the benefits of her Facebook photos with African animals to help get a television deal . 'This time I got my leopard,' writes Jones of a third safari she took at age 14.  'And also took down a hippo to get 6 of the Dangerous 7'","Kendall Jones, 19, is posting the photos on Facebook, where some believe the shots should be taken down .

"A smartphone game that encourages girls to dress sexily and go on dates with 'hot guys' in the hope of becoming models has come under fire for promoting the wrong values to girls. Star Girl, which has 1.3million likes on Facebook and was until recently aimed at children aged four+ on iTunes, is now rated 12+ but is played by thousands of young children. It invites children to step 'into the high heels of an aspiring celebrity who is setting out to build her career as a superstar while having a ton of fun along the way'. Controversial: Previously age-rated four+ but now upgraded to 12+, Star Girl encourages children to dress sexily and meet men in nightclubs . Values: Gamers are told they must dress well and date sexy celebrities in order to further their careers . Gamers are encouraged to dress their celebrity avatar, or on-screen character, in racy clothing from lingerie shops and to visit nightclubs to flirt with 'hot celebrities' in exchange for gifts. The app, which is free to download but lets players make in-app purchases, tells girls: 'You've got the looks, but it takes more than than to be a star! 'Just remember that first impressions are the most important so make sure to wear only the trendiest outfit.' 'Hang out with your friends and go on dates with the hottest guys in town to find your perfect match.' Players are told they have 'three main career options: singer, actress, model', and encourages them to 'Shop til you drop!  Flirt and go on dates to find the man of your dreams.'

"Police arrested a prominent former Canadian Broadcasting Corp. radio host on sexual assault charges on Wednesday. Toronto police said in a statement that former CBC star radio host Jian Ghomeshi has been charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of what they called 'overcome resistance — choking.' The allegations, first reported in the media in October, rocked the Canadian public broadcaster, a vaunted Canadian institution. Scroll down for video . Jian Ghomeshi, a prominent former Canadian Broadcast Corp. radio host, was charged with four counts of sexual assault on Wednesday . Ghomeshi, 47, was released Wednesday afternoon on $100,000. He was told he must stay in Canada and live with his mother, reports Mashable. He had hosted 'Q', a CBC radio show on culture, since 2007. His show was also heard on National Public Radio and Public Radio International stations in the U.S. Ghomeshi arrived at a Toronto courthouse in the back of police car ahead of what's expected to be a brief appearance. Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair declined comment earlier, saying the matter is now before the courts. CBC fired Ghomeshi in October, saying his firing was prompted by the emergence of 'graphic' evidence that he had caused physical injury to a person. Ghomeshi defended his actions in a 1,500- word statement on Facebook then, saying he had consensual 'rough sex' with women and is the victim of a disgruntled ex-girlfriend. After the Toronto Star reported several more allegations days later, Ghomeshi posted that he would confront the allegations 'directly,' but wouldn't discuss them with the media. Canned: CBC fired Ghomeshi in October, saying his firing was prompted by the emergence of 'graphic' evidence that he had caused physical injury to a person . Police urged in late October for other women to come forward. Police began the investigation after nine victims had contacted various media sources to report incidents of assault and sexual assault involving Ghomeshi. One of the women who contacted police was actress Lucy DeCoutere, a star of the long-running TV and film series 'Trailer Park Boys.' DeCoutere, who also serves as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force, was the first woman who made allegations against Ghomeshi to speak on the record about her experience. DeCoutere said she went on a date with him and alleges that when they returned to his home, he pressed her up against a wall, choked her and slapped her across the face several times. Author and lawyer Reva Seth became the second woman to go public, writing in the Huffington Post that Ghomeshi put his hands around her throat and sexually assaulted her, although it was not known if she was one of the women who filed a complaint to police against Ghomeshi. Seth described in the blog how Ghomeshi was 'funny and charming,' when the pair first started seeing each other casually. But one evening, she claims, his behaviour suddenly changed. Accuser: Reva Seth (pictured right) says she met Jian Ghomeshi (left) in 2002 as a 26-year-old after starting a new job in Toronto, Canada . She wrote: 'When it was over, I got up and it was clear I was really angry. My sexual interactions until then had always been consensual, enjoyable and fun. 'He gave me some weird lines about how he couldn't tell if I was actually attracted to him or not. And somehow this was meant to explain his behaviour.' Afterwards she decided not to involve the police and opted not to come forward fearing the impact of online trolls. But she eventually decided to reveal her identity after hearing Lucy DeCoutere speaking on CBC about her 'remarkably similar experience'. None of the allegations from any of the women have been proven. Ghomeshi's lawyer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. After he was fired, Ghomeshi launched a $55-million lawsuit against the CBC for breach of confidence and defamation. He dropped that lawsuit Tuesday. A union grievance alleging dismissal without proper cause remains.

"Gordon Ramsay is being sued by his father-in-law's former mistress for breach of privacy over claims he hired a private detective to take intimate photos of her through her bedroom window. Sara Stewart, 50, an accountant who had a five-year affair with Ramsay's father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, lodged a writ at the High Court on August 17 claiming breaches of personal privacy while she was employed by the chef's firm Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH). The allegations relate to photographs that Mrs Stewart – a widowed mother of four who worked for Ramsay for 12 years – has previously claimed were obtained through surveillance during her relationship with Ramsay's business partner Mr Hutcheson. Claim: Sara Stewart, who had a five-year affair with Gordon Ramsay's father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, is suing the celebrity chef for breach of privacy - alleging he hired a private detective to take intimate photos of her . In an interview with The Mail on Sunday last year, Mrs Stewart told how she believed detectives took a number of intimate pictures of her with Mr Hutcheson through a bedroom window of her £ 2.5 million home in Ascot, Berkshire, which she claimed Ramsay threatened to make public. In November 2010, Ramsay, who is married to Mr Hutcheson's daughter Tana, admitted in an open letter to his mother-in-law Greta that he hired private detectives to watch her husband, whom he suspected of financial misconduct and reading his personal emails. It read: 'To curb my suspicions I employed a private detective and the situation started to unravel very quickly. The very complex life that Chris leads has seen many of my key staff feeling that they had to cover on his behalf. His away days were rarely what I thought they were.' Family affair: Gordon Ramsey is married to Chris Hutcheson's daughter Tana . The High Court case, which will be heard by judge Master Bowles later this year, is the latest round in a series of highly publicised legal battles that have torn through the multi-million-pound Ramsay empire over the past two years. In October 2010, Ramsay sacked his father-in-law as chief executive of GRH and suspended Mrs Stewart, the company's director of digital media, while her lover was investigated. Later that month, Mrs Stewart claimed Ramsay sent Mr Hutcheson's son Adam a text message which read: 'Please tell Sarah [sic] to close her curtains in Ascot there's a footpath right outside her window. Shots are amazing. Happy to pass the whole ******* lot to the NOTW [News Of The World] . . . ps I've also got a [memory] stick for your PC if you want to see the most amazing footage.' Mrs Stewart claims that when she emailed Ramsay to say his actions gave her 'significant concern' for her children's safety, the chef replied by sending her a photograph showing her topless with Mr Hutcheson. Last August, Ramsay filed a writ accusing his father-in-law of hacking into personal and company files and of using £1.4 million of company money to fund a double life with his mistress. In December 2011, Ramsay was awarded £250,000 for breach of confidence for accessing private emails, but faced a counter-claim from Mr Hutcheson for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages. The cases were settled out of court in February for an undisclosed amount after both parties withdrew their claims. In a statement, GRH said: 'We can confirm that Gordon Ramsay and Gordon Ramsay Holdings have reached a settlement with Chris Hutcheson and other members of the Hutcheson family. 'The terms of the settlement are confidential but we can confirm that Chris Hutcheson is no longer a director or shareholder of Gordon Ramsay Holdings and all civil litigation and employment tribunal claims brought by each of the two parties and other family members have been withdrawn.'

"A couple who moved to France from Britain for a ‘dream retirement’ have been found shot dead in their home in their picturesque Pyrenean village. Derek Hawkins, 98, is thought to have blasted his wife Sheila, 86, to death with a .22 calibre rifle before turning the weapon on himself. He is said to have told his therapist he was ‘morally tired’ and ‘if I go, it won’t be alone.’ Derek and Sheila Hawkins, who moved to France from Britain for a ‘dream retirement’, have been found shot dead in their home in Fabas, southern France (file picture of the town hall in the village) The suspected suicide pact is likely to have happened because of the couple’s advanced age, local investigators believe. A cleaning lady found the body early on Monday morning in Fabas, not far from Toulouse, in the Ariege department in the foothills of the Pyrenees. The Hawkins moved to the village, which has a population of less than 250, in the 1980s and ‘often spoken about their dream retirement’, said a near neighbour. He added: ‘They were a lovely couple who raised Dachshunds, and they got on extremely well with everybody.’ But, as they got older, life appeared to be getting much harder for both, said the neighbour. The gun was found close to Mr Hawkins, who originally came from the USA, while Mrs Hawkins, who was British, had a single wound to her body. An autopsy will be held in Toulouse today, and detectives are currently working on the theory that the husband ‘killed his wife and then turned the gun on himself.’ French police believe Derek Hawkins may have shot his wife Sheila before turning the weapon on himself (file picture) Police from Sainte-Croix-Volvestre are investigating, with Foix prosecutor Geraldine Labialle saying: ‘Suicide is the most likely track. There was no sign of a struggle. ‘Mr Hawkins is thought to have told his therapist he was tired of everything, and if he went it would not be alone.’ Nobody else is being searched for in connection with the tragedy. In 2010, the Hawkins were involved in a fire drama, when the large barn in which they kep their dogs burned down overnight. Simon Bavard, the mayor of Fabas, said: ‘They moved here around thirty years ago, and were very well integrated. ‘Despite their age, they continued to live on their old farm house just on the outskirts of the village.’","Cleaning lady discovered the couple dead in their home early on Monday .

"Actor William Shatner has been forced to deny he will be switching on the Christmas lights in a Cheshire market town after being caught up in hoax. The Star Trek legend took to his Twitter account to say he was not booked to switch on the festive lights in Frodsham after promotional material advertising his appearance was circulated online. Shatner, who played Captain Kirk in the cult sci-fi series, joked: 'There's a reason why the word Sham is in the name!' before confirming the rumours weren't true. Scroll down for video . Hoax: Star Trek legend William Shatner took to his Twitter account to deny he was booked to switch on the festive lights in Frodsham after promotional material advertising his appearance was circulated (pictured) Denial: The Hollywood actor confirmed he would not be attending the event as it was revealed to be a hoax . It came after the Twitter account @Frodshamxmas claimed the actor was set to appear at this Saturday's light switch-on in the town, which is best known for being the former home of Take That star Gary Barlow. The account tweeted a picture of 83-year-old Shatner, with a signed 'quote' from him that read: 'I'm very excited to be coming to Frodsham. 'I've long been fascinated by the glacial landscape of the Cheshire countryside - its vast plain and sandstone ridges, not unlike some distant planet visited by the crew of the Enterprise! See you there!' Other 'promotional' material featured his face on a poster of the event, alongside the words: 'With special guest William 'Captain Kirk' Shatner'. Another tweet also claimed the actor would be 'singing some songs from his new Christmas album' at the switch-on, and accompanied the message with an old video of him performing Rocket Man. However, the Hollywood actor took to his Twitter page to deny he would be attending the event. He wrote: 'The village of Frodsham UK is promising I will turn on holiday lights? There's a reason why the word Sham is in the name!

Fake: The Frodsham Xmas 2014 Twitter account also suggested Shatner would be performing at the event . Councillor Mike Pusey, chairman of Love Frodsham which helps organise the switch-on, ruefully admitted: 'It's a hoax. The account has been set up by a young lad who has done it as a joke. 'Fortunately I don't think it will cause any hassle, as I don't think for one minute people would have believed that William Shatner would come and switch the lights on. 'It would have been more of a problem if they had said it was Gary Barlow, as he's from here so people might have believed that.' Mr Pusey said there were other attractions at this weekend's event and added: 'Santa will be here from 12pm until 8pm, and we've got face painters and children's entertainers, with no charge to the public.

"The Fairphone (pictured) is built using conflict-free minerals and is assembled in a factory where the welfare of workers is a top priority . It may not boast the most impressive camera or respond touch ID, but a new smartphone claims to beat the big smartphone brands at being the most ethical in the world. The Fairphone is built using conflict-free minerals and is assembled in a factory where the welfare of workers is a top priority. The mobile has been designed for people who care more about their gadgets’ environmental and societal impact than top specifications, but it still hosts an array of apps and looks like any other smartphone. The Fairphone is available from The Phone Co-op, which claims to be the UK’s most socially-minded mobile provider. The Android handset has a quad-core 1.2Ghz processor and 16GB of memory, an eight megapixel rear camera and a 4.3 inch touchscreen – comparing with a mid-range smartphone, rather than the likes of the Galaxy S5 or iPhone 6. It's cheaper than the two high-end options, costing from £22 a month, or £250 up front with £2 a month line rental, with an additional monthly fee of £5 for 1GB of data. A pay as you go option will be available soon. In comparison, a 16GB iPhone 6 handset costs £539, or from £38 a month on contract, albeit with twice as much data as the Fairphone.

Fairphone works directly with initiatives in the Democratic Republic of Congo to source tin and tantalum in a responsible way. Many mines in the Republic are controlled by armed rebel groups who extort money from the miners, contributing to political and economic instability. So Fairphone invests in certified conflict-free mines to improve workers’ rights and economic prosperity. The company also works with a Chinese factory where it has set up a worker welfare fund. For every phone sold, $5 (£3) is paid into this fund, worth $300,000 (£190,165) to date. The money will be spent on projects that benefit workers, such as wage levels, workplace improvements, skills training and leisure activities. Large electronics companies have come under fire for working with Foxxconn, in China, which produces around 40 per cent of the world’s consumer electronics. The company has been accused of underage labour, long shifts, poor conditions and even suicides in the past and there has been demand from consumers for ethical products.

'Eventually the mother moved on and slowly the cubs followed - after a little dancing and playing. 'It was just great to be in the right place at the right time and have great light to see and also photograph the cubs. 'If the weather had been foggy then it would have been a lot harder to even spot the bears let alone observe them. Even as they disappeared into the distance, the  cubs continued play fighting and leaping around . 'I have been carrying a camera around with me since I was a teenager and developed images in my darkroom before the wonderful digital cameras emerged.

"A NSW teenager celebrating the end of school exams in Bali was rushed to hospital after consuming a dangerous cocktail which was suspected to have been laced with methanol. Jackson Tuckwell, from Stockton in Newcastle, NSW, was partying with friends at a popular Legian nightclub on Sunday evening when he consumed a 'blaster' cocktail. The concoction of vodka, other spirits and pineapple juice rendered the 18-year-old unable to walk, talk or see,The Newcastle Herald reported. Jackson Tuckwell was hospitalised while partying in Bali for Schoolies after he suffered suspected methanol poisoning . His distressed mother Tanya said she was first notified that something had happened when her daughter rang to say she'd heard her brother was in hospital with methanol poisoning. 'She said he was blind and he couldn't walk, that’s when I really started to panic,' Tanya told the Newcastle Herald. 'I didn't know whether to hop on a plane and fly over there or what.' Since receiving the devastating news the anxious mother had desperately been trying to contact Jackson - who turned 18 on Wednesday - and had already reached out to his hotel and the Australian Consulate-General in Bali. The teenager's mother heard her son has been unwell but is yet to speak to him . It is Tanya's understanding that her son has since been released from hospital but it was unlike him to drink from anything he didn't open himself. Jackson's friends think his drink may have been spiked. His mother said Jackson had been to Bali before and understands how it works, but despite this Tanya wasn't happy about him travelling to the island for Schoolies. Around 6000 students will travel to the popular Indonesian island in search of cheap drinks, all-night parties and other adventures in the coming weeks. Jackson has travelled to Bali before and his family said he knows he should only drink alcohol he has opened himself . The teenager is one of thousands of Australians who have flocked to Bali to celebrate Schoolies . 'The message needs to get out there, Bali is a beautiful place, but there is a downside and that is the nightclub scene. It can be very dangerous,' Tanya warned. Just last year Perth teenager Liam Davies died of a suspected methanol overdose, while holidaying in Lombok, Indonesia. The 29-year-old was evacuated to Perth but passed away in hospital.

"Terrorists are taking out student loans and cheating the welfare system to bankroll jihad overseas, a senior police officer warned last night. Terri Nicholson, of the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said charity scams were also being used to fund Islamic State fanatics in Syria. ‘We are seeing diverse fraud including substantial fraud online, abuse of the benefits system, abuse of student loans, in order to fund terrorism,’ she said. Terrorists are also turning to online fraud and are using some forms of internet currency to transfer money abroad to fund jihadist groups, according to police . ‘We have had a number of cases in recent times where student loans have been abused to fund both crime and terrorism. ‘We have seen some cases where virtual currency is being considered and used by both criminals and terrorists. And so we are increasing our understanding of the abuse of those methods.’ The Detective Chief Superintendent said women were increasingly being deployed to take the money overseas because they arouse less suspicion. ‘It is far better in many cases to use somebody who is not known to law enforcement, and females absolutely are used by both criminals and terrorists alike to move funds,’ she said. She urged the public to be careful when donating to charities to ensure their money is not diverted by ‘undesirable individuals’. In the past 18 months, police in London have seized £2.5million of donations destined for criminal and terrorist gangs. Miss Nicholson’s intervention came amid continued fallout from the Intelligence and Security Committee’s report into the Lee Rigby atrocity. His sister, Sara McLure, said she ‘blamed’ Facebook for the fact MI5 failed to prevent his appalling murder at the hands of Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo at Woolwich Barracks. As the Mail reported yesterday, the social networking site hosted ‘graphic and emotive’ messages by Adebowale in which he revealed his grotesque wish to ‘kill a soldier’. The new warning comes amid fallout from the report into the killing of Lee Rigby (left) after it emerged that Facebook failed to report messages from Michael Adebowale (right) about wanting to 'kill a soldier' In ‘substantial’ online exchanges with an Al Qaeda extremist codenamed FOXTROT, the Muslim convert received advice on how to carry out an assault and was instructed to use a knife – one of the weapons used to hack Fusilier Rigby to death in May last year. But Facebook did not alert MI5 to the messages, which were not detected by its automated software and only emerged after the murder in May last year. It also failed to tell the security services it had already disabled seven of Adebowale’s accounts – five for links to terrorism. The ISC report also criticised MI5 and MI6 for blunders made while tracking Adebowale and Adebolajo.","Online fraud and internet currency being used to funnel money abroad .

Jason Lindsley was seen talking to Ali Joubouri (both pictured far left) before Lindsley was punched to the ground . Jason Lindsley's friends rush to his aid after he was knocked to the floor with one punch . Within seconds, Joubouri is seen stepping back and punching Mr Lindlsey in the face before he slumps to the ground and his friends crowd around him. In other angles from CCTV footage, security guards are seen rushing to where he was lying before they escort Joubouri out of the venue. The Advertiser reported Joubouri's lawyers blamed the attack on a racial slur, it is believed their client heard before he threw the punch and referred to him as 'over-sensitive' due to an attack months earlier where he was stabbed. Already in custody for 18 months, his lawyers also asked for his release so he could 'continue his rehabilitation'. But the court was urged not to hear his excuses, as prosecutor Kos Lesses argued Joubouri was on bail, banned from the CBD and in breach of curfew. Joubouri, 22, from Walkley Heights initially pleaded not guilty to charges, just last month he pleaded guilty to recklessly causing serious harm to Mr Lindsley who was in a coma for a fortnight and needed several surgeries after suffering a serious brain injury. It took Mr Lindsley 10 months of recovery and rehabilitation before he could return to work full-time. The victim was 24 years old when the attack happened and left him in a coma for a fortnight . It took Mr Lindsley 10 months to recovery from his injuries inflicted in August 2012 . Another one of Joubouri's lawyers, Jon Lister, said his client  was suffering from post traumatic stress, The Advertiser reported. 'There was turmoil in his life, he was off the rails because of the fallout from his terrifying ordeal when he himself was nearly killed,' he said. In a letter of apology addressed to Mr Lindsley's parents, Joubouri said he was 'deeply sorry' for the pain he had caused the family as a result of that 'terrible night'. 'I have written this letter over and over again for the past year but I have been too embarrassed and ashamed to send it,' he said. 'I have finally had the power within myself to send it and more importantly I thought your family would like some closure.' The district court was shown shocking vision of CCTV footage (pictured), from the night of the incident at Adelaide nightclub Zhivago in August 2012, where Ali Joubouri threw a single punch at the victim, which saw him instantly drop to the ground . The footage shows Jason Lindsley talking and drinking with friends before he is punched and falls to the ground where friends crowd around him . While claiming his letter wasn't to 'look for sympathy' or to 'justify' his actions he wanted to explain his difficulty growing up and being the victim of a vicious assault himself. 'I hope you will accept my apology and forgive me for what I have put your family through and I apologise to your son for all the pain and suffering I have put him through,' he said. Joubouri also wrote a letter to the judge detailing his tough upbringing and how sorry he was for his actions. 'I have learnt a lot of life lessons and grown more mature in my time in prison,' he said. 'Hope you will find mercy within yourself to give me a second chance.' Joubouri has been remanded in custody for sentencing next month. Mr Lindsley's father, Doug, told The Advertiser outside court there was no justification for his violent behaviour. 'Let’s hope justice comes forward, and that (the sentence) shows a lot of people you can’t do this and get away with it,' he said.","Adelaide court sees distressing CCTV footage of Jason Lindsley knocked down by a single punch in a city nightclub in August 2012 .

"Convicted murderer Charles Manson is marrying a 25-year-old supporter, she has claimed. Star, a name given to her by the 79-year-old cult leader, moved next to California's Corcoran State Prison when she was just 19 to be closer to him and has recently carved an X into her forehead to match his swastika. 'Yeah, well, people can think I'm crazy,' she told Rolling Stone magazine in a lengthy article about her beau. 'But they don't know. This is what's right for me. This is what I was born for.' Star, who runs multiple websites calling for Manson's release, said she knows she will be his wife. Scroll down for video . 'Together': Convicted killer Charles Manson, left, has apparently found love with a 25-year-old artist and supporter he named Star, right. She has claimed that they are going to marry . Fan: Star, pictured in a support video for Manson, moved beside his California prison when she was 19 . 'I'll tell you straight up, Charlie . and I are going to get married,' she said. 'When that will be, we don't . know. But I take it very seriously. Charlie is my husband. Charlie told . me to tell you this. We haven't told anybody about that.' But Manson sounded a little more apprehensive when the interviewer asked him about his impending nuptials to Star. 'Oh . that,' he said. 'That's a bunch of garbage. You know that, man. That's . trash. We're just playing that for public consumption.' Star, . an artist, was born in St Louis, Missouri to a religious family who . locked her in her room throughout her high school years after she . refused to go to church and started taking drugs. While in high school, a friend told . her about Manson's environmental writing and she decided to contact him, . Rolling Stone reported. When she was 19, she took $2,000 she saved working in a retirement home kitchen and jumped on a train headed to California. See more of this video on YouTube . Visits: Every Saturday and Sunday she visits him at Corcoran State Prison, pictured, for up to five hours a day . She . now visits him every Saturday and Sunday for up to five hours a day and claims that her parents like him, and have even offered them to move in with the family if he ever gets out of prison. Photographs on Facebook and websites calling for his release show the couple posing . beside each other and touching during the lengthy visiting hours - which she said was not enough. 'I just want to be alone,' she said. I don't want to be always in that visiting room with people staring at me. But that's the only time I get to see him, in that room, with people staring. It's hard. But things change, you know. And who knows what could happen?' He is also pictured in the images with Craig Carlisle Hammond, 63, whom Manson called 'Gray Wolf'. In March, Hammond was accused of trying to smuggle a cell phone to Manson during visiting hours, raising questions over the apparent freedom Manson is enjoying with his visiting friends. If his marriage to Star does go ahead, it will not be the first for Manson, who has two ex-wives and at least three children. He . married Rosalie Willis in 1954 but they divorced in 1957 - a year into . his prison term for stealing cars. After leaving prison in 1958, he . married a prostitute called Candy Stevens. But again, she divorced him . when he was sent back to jail. Victim: Among those killed by Manson and his followers was actress Sharon Tate, pictured left with her husband director Roman Polanski and right. She was eight months pregnant when she was killed in 1969 . Locked up: Manson, pictured during his trial in 1970, was married twice before his murder convictions . In the interview with Rolling Stone, he also hinted that he is more fluid about his sexuality than previously thought. 'Sex to me is like going to the toilet,' he said. 'Whether it's a girl or not, it doesn't matter. I don't play that girl-guy s***. I'm not hung up in that game.' He also recounted an incident from when he was 17 in which he said he asked a man to have sex, and when the man refused, he brandished a knife and promised to take the blame if they were caught. The man agreed. Manson brainwashed members of a commune known as The Family into butchering eight people including film director Roman Polanski’s pregnant wife Sharon Tate in July and August 1969. He was convicted of the slayings as well as the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in July 1969. He was originally given a death sentence but spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Manson will next be eligible for parole in 15 years, when he will be 92-years-old. When he was denied release in 2007 the parole board ruled that he 'continues to pose an unreasonable danger to others and may still bring harm to anyone he would come in contact with'.","'Star' began writing to the convicted killer as a teen and moved next to Corcoran State Prison when she was 19 to be close to him .

"The house where notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed is on the market – and it could be transformed into a tourist destination. With an asking price of $250,000 (£160,000), the five-bedroom house in Medellin is already a draw for curious visitors who want to see where the wealthy and ruthless drug lord’s reign of terror came to an abrupt end 21 years ago. But it could become a legitimate tourist site – such as a themed guesthouse or public museum – now that it is being advertised as an opportunity for rich foreign investors, according to Colombia Reports. Scroll down for video . The five-bedroom house where Pablo Escobar spent his final days has been listed for £160,000 . 'King of Cocaine': Pablo Escobar is said to have had a net worth of nearly £20bn . After becoming one of the world’s wealthiest and most feared men, Escobar, who is said to have had a net worth of nearly £20bn, was gunned down on the roof of the two-storey house as he tried to elude the Search Bloc, a special police unit established to lead the manhunt, on 2 December 1993. ‘The King of Cocaine’ and other members of the Medellin Cartel were among the world’s most wanted drug traffickers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with US special forces joining the manhunt a year before he was killed. A man walks in front of the house in 2008, the year it was purchased, after falling into disrepair . Colombian police and military forces storm the rooftop where drug lord Pablo Escobar was shot dead . Today, tourists regularly pull up to the house to snap photos, but current homeowner Omar Restrepo has denied their requests to get a peek inside the bedroom where Escobar spent his final days or a look at the roof where he was killed, Colombia reports said. Before it was purchased by Mr Restrepo in 2008 the property was abandoned and had fallen into disrepair while it was occupied by drug users and homeless people. Thieves stripped the house of almost everything, including its electrical cords and light switches, and even ripped open walls hoping to find cash or objects left behind by the drug lord. With his wealth, Pablo Escobar built a luxurious Medellin estate known as Hacienda Napoles . After extensive renovations the house was listed for sale in 2012 but was taken off the market. Earlier this year, restaurant owner Christian Berdouare paid nearly £6m for a Miami Beach mansion once owned by the cocaine kingpin. Mr Berdouare planned to tear down the coral pink house, seized by US officials in the late 1980s, and rebuild.","Medellin property is already a draw for curious tourists .

"A 12-year-old boy had a lucky escape after a glass table close to his bed spontaneously exploded. Adam Hodges had just left his bedroom in Basildon in Essex to go for breakfast when the table exploded, leaving thousands of sharp shards of glass embedded in the wall and door. The table was near the boy's bed and next to a radiator which may have caused it to spontaneously shatter through a reaction known as 'thermal shock.' Scroll down for video . Adam Hodges, 12, narrowly escaped being injured after a table in his bedroom spontaneously exploded, leaving thousands of shards of glass embedded in the walls and doors of his room in Basildon in Essex . Adam's father Nick Hodges, 41, said the explosion sounded like a gunshot and his son would certainly have been injured had he been in the room on Sunday morning. When he heard the loud bang Mr Hodges went up to the bedroom and saw thousands of pieces of glass, most of them sharp and measuring up to half an inch, embedded in the wall and door of the room. 'All of a sudden there was a terrific bang - like a gunshot,' said Mr Hodges. 'We went up to have a look and there was glass everywhere. 'The glass was still crackling like a log on a fire. 'There was glass embedded in the door and wall.' Mr Hodges said a computer monitor, keyboard and printer had been placed on the table and none of the items were very heavy. He had bought the Ikea table for his son about a year ago for £60 from Ikea in Lakeside in Thurrock, Essex. It had taken two people to lift and position the hefty piece of furniture close to a radiator in his bedroom. Mr Hodges said had his son been in the room he would probably have been hurt by the sharp pieces of glass . 'If it had happened at night, in the dark, and my son had woken up and got out of bed without shoes on, he would have suffered cuts,' added Mr Hodges. It is thought the table may have exploded because of thermal shock, where temperature changes over time can cause parts of an object to expand by different amounts. Ikea agreed to pay the family £100 in compensation. The family bought the table for £60 last year and have been offered £100 in compensation after it exploded . A spokesman said: 'The safety of our products is always the highest priority and our entire range is tested rigorously. 'Whenever we learn of a possible fault with the design, material or manufacture, we investigate immediately and thoroughly. 'We have already been in contact with Mr Hodges to apologise and are investigating the matter further.'","Adam Hodges, 12, left the room just before his glass table exploded .

"A facial palsy sufferer who spent years hiding indoors and undergoing painful surgery has found love and married. Carly Bailey, 33, from Sheffield, was diagnosed with the condition, which causes a weakness of the facial muscles and paralysis, when she was 14 years old. The mother-of-two felt she was ‘too ugly’ to find love and hardly ever went outside after suffering years of torment. Carly Bailey, on her wedding day to husband Scott, pictured, with children Madalyn, Harvey and Ashton. Mrs Bailey thought she would never find love after suffering from facial palsy . Mrs Bailey was diagnosed with facial palsy when she was 14 and had to pluck up the courage to ask out now husband Scott, right . But after plucking up the courage, she asked out her now husband Scott for a drink and their relationship blossomed. Now they are married, with Mrs Bailey saying he is helped her to transform her life. She explained: 'I never thought I’d find love, I had given up hope on finding my Mr Perfect. 'I’ve spent the last twenty years hiding my face and after a few unsuccessful facial surgeries, I was left feeling ugly and alone. Mrs Bailey has credited her husband Scott with helping to transform her life and building her confidence . The couple were married last month in a ceremony at Sheffield Town Hall, despite Mrs Bailey spending years hiding indoors . 'I had known Scott for about seven years but I had never plucked up the confidence to tell him how I felt about him. 'I was terrified he’d reject me because of the way I looked. I didn’t think for a second that he’d actually fancy me too. 'I’ve been living on cloud nine ever since I met Scott, it was the happiest day of my life when we got married. 'He has completely transformed my life and I finally feel comfortable in my own skin.' The couple tied the knot last month in a ceremony at Sheffield Town Hall. She added: 'I had never been in love before I met Scott. Since her diagnosis, the 33-year-old has undergone 16 operations to try and correct her face leaving her with scars, right . 'But he was worth the wait as we are perfect for each other.' Mrs Bailey had been bullied throughout school for her facial palsy, something that had dented her confidence for more than 18 years. Doctors first thought she was suffering from Bell’s Palsy, a temporary facial paralysis that would last about six weeks. But three months later, she was sent for an MRI scan, after there was no improvement. This revealed she was suffering from cholesteatoma, a serious infection of the ear. In Mrs Bailey's case the disease was attacking the bones in her ear something that led to facial palsy. She was left feeling too frightened to leave the house and only ventured outdoors to go to work. Mrs Bailey with her two daughters Madalyn and Ashton. She says she can't thank the charity Changing Faces enough for helping her to accept her appearance . She added: 'Since my diagnosis I have undergone 16 operations to try and correct some of the muscles in my face but all of them failed to improve my self-esteem. 'It wasn’t until talking to the charity Changing Faces that I started to accept my appearance. Facial palsy is caused by a weakness of the facial muscles due to either temporary or permanent damage to nerves in the face. When the nerves are damaged they are unable to receive the necessary messages in order to function properly, which results in paralysis in the affected part of the face. Nerve damage can be caused by viral infections such as Bell's palsy or bacterial infections affecting the ear. Other causes are surgery, traumatic injuries and stroke. It can affect one part or all of the face and can also affect tears, saliva production and taste. 'This new confidence gave me the push I needed to approach Scott and tell him how I felt. 'I can’t thank the charity enough, they have transformed my life. 'I couldn't be happier with how things have turned out, I feel as though as my dreams have come true.' The couple who both have children from previous relationships, can’t wait to start their new lives together. Scott has three children, Harvey, three, Nikki, 14 and Josh 15 and Carly has two, Madalyn, 11 and Ashton, six. Dr James Partridge OBE, chief executive of Changing Faces said: 'We are so proud that our work has helped Carly so much. 'She is a truly amazing, inspirational woman, and her determination just goes to show that with the right help and support, having an unusual appearance shouldn't be a barrier to success. 'We have a fantastic team in Sheffield, helping people right across Yorkshire and The Humber, and we hope that Carly’s story will encourage other people to come to us and get support. We wish Carly and Scott every happiness in their life together.'","Carly Bailey was diagnosed with facial palsy when she was 14 years old .

Senator Lundy said she had decided not to contest the ACT Senate seat at the next federal election, a decision which had come after a period of deep reflection. 'Next March will mark 19 years since I was first elected to represent the ACT in the Australian Senate,' she said in a statement. Senator Lundy said she had decided not to contest the ACT Senate seat at the next federal election . 'I will work with the ACT ALP to ensure a smooth transition over the next six months.' Senator Lundy, 46, a former union official, was elected to the Senate in 1996, holding a range of opposition and ministerial positions. She said it had been an honour to serve the people of Canberra for almost two decades. Senator Lundy said it was important to have a strong opposition to oppose cuts to public service pay and conditions, to protect Medicare and keep universities accessible. She made the announcement on Twitter on Wednesday night . 'With political battles raging on a range of fronts for the Australian community – challenges such as fighting against APS cuts and condition reductions, protecting Medicare, keeping university fair and accessible, defending the CSIRO and research funding and fighting ABC/SBS cuts make it more important than ever to have a strong opposition,' she said.

"One in ten people would take a pay cut if they were allowed to reduce their working week, file picture . One in ten employees feel so overworked they would happily take a pay cut if they could do fewer hours. The number of overstretched workers has risen 10 per cent over the past year to three million, official figures show. Chief executives, doctors, dentists and senior police officers were the most ‘overemployed’, with the highest concentration found in the South West. They typically want to cut back 11 hours back a week, according to the Office for National Statistics. Staff in their 50s and early 60s were keenest for more time off and those in their 20s the least eager. Women were slightly more overworked than men. The ONS report also shows that one in ten staff wanted to work extra hours to gain more money. Three million people are now classed as ‘underemployed’, a problem most common among waiters, cleaners and sales assistants. The number of underemployed Britons has fallen only slightly over the past six years, which economists said cast doubts on the country’s ‘jobs miracle’. The Government has seized on figures showing employment has climbed to 30.7million in the last quarter, the highest since records began in 1971. But the ONS report on underemployment, which is affecting 9.9 per cent of the workforce, suggests there is still slack in the economy. John Philpott, of The Jobs Economist, a research consultancy, said it was the sixth successive year in which the underemployment rate had been above 9.5 per cent. He added: ‘Such a prolonged period of mass underemployment demonstrates the extent to which the very good headline employment and unemployment figures of recent years mask a substantial underlying shortage of work, the persistence of which takes some gloss off the UK’s supposed jobs miracle.’ One in five part-timers is underworked compared with one in 20 in a full-time job. The North East has the highest percentage of underemployed workers in Britain. Frances O’Grady, of the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘It makes no sense that there are so many people wanting more work, while others complain of being overworked. ‘The Government should strengthen flexible working rights, which could help solve both problems.’ Ministers have already introduced a shake-up giving every worker the right to ask for flexible hours whatever their circumstances. But there is no legal requirement for firms to grant the requests. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We have record employment with countless individual stories of hard work and determination. ‘The vast majority of the rise in employment over the last year has been in full-time jobs and more than four out of five people who work part-time do so because they want to.’ Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress said it was madness that people were being overworked at a time when there was so many people out of work, she said more flexibility should be encouraged .","One in ten workers want to work fewer hours according to new research .

"Google's deal with Apple as the default search engine on Safari (pictured) expires in 2015. Reports claim Yahoo and Microsoft are pitching for the slot . Firefox turned its back on Google as its default search engine last week, and Apple may be looking to do the same. Google has been the default engine on Apple's Safari browser for the past five years, but the deal is due to expire in early 2015. This could see Microsoft's Bing or Yahoo taking its place - or the tech giant could be working on developing a search engine of its own. Both Yahoo and Microsoft have already started canvassing Apple about becoming the default engine on iOS devices and Macs, according to The Information's Amir Efrati. Mr Efrati said Apple is likely to base the decision on the 'quality of the product as much as the potential money made from search ads.' Google reportedly paid Apple $82 million (£52 million) in 2009, and $1 billion (£636 million) last year for the partnership. Search engines make money from such partnerships by sending traffic to their servers, and profiting from ad revenue. But Apple has been distancing itself from its rival for sometime. When it launched iOS 7, the default search engine for Siri was Microsoft's Bing. While Yahoo was the default weather app until Apple launched iOS 8, at which point it was replaced by the Weather Channel. Apple also replaced Google Maps with its own proprietary service, and stopped pre-installing Google-owned YouTube on devices. Within Apple Maps, local searches are made using services such as Yelp. The reports follow an announcement from Firefox last week that it is ditching Google as its default search engine. From the start of December, people using the browser in the US will be switched to Yahoo as the default service. Mozilla said the UK will remain unaffected, for the time being . Back in 2010, analysts at Piper Jaffray claimed there was a 70 per cent chance Apple would launch its own mobile search engine by 2015, and the impending end of the Google and Apple deal has bolstered these claims. After a decade, Mozilla announced last week it is ending its partnership with Google as the default option for Firefox web searches. From the start of December, people using the browser in the US will be switched to Yahoo. In Russia, Firefox will start using local search engine Yandex, and Baidu will continue to be the default search engine in China. Mozilla said the UK will remain unaffected, for the time being. Firefox is an open-source browser that was launched by California-based Mozilla in 2002. As of October 2014, it was the third most used web browser in the world, behind Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and Safari. In November, Apple Insider reported that a so-called web-crawling bot had been spotted on Apple's servers. This could be the start of developing its own search engine, but may also simply be used to boost its local and built-in search options. For example, OS X Yosemite's Spotlight Search tool scours the desktop, but also the web, maps and Wikipedia. In 2013, Re/code reported Yahoo was 'aggressively' working to increase revenue and the focus was to become the default on Apple products. Firefox signed a deal with Yahoo last week to replace Google as the default search option - although users can revert back in Settings. Five years ago, Yahoo signed a deal with Microsoft to have Bing to carry out behind-the-scenes indexing of online content. Yahoo and Microsoft agreed to split ad revenue under terms of the 10-year search deal, which let Yahoo focus on customising query results for users. Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer has repeatedly stressed that Yahoo remains devoted to the search market that the company pioneered, but which Google eventually dominated. Even if Apple does replace Google as its default engine, users are expected to be able to revert back, or select an alternative in the browser's settings. Google told MailOnline is doesn't comment on speculation. Apple has not replied to MailOnline's request for information. As of October 2014, Firefox is the third most used web browser in the world, behind Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Safari .","Google's partnership with Apple is due to expire in early 2015 .

"A pill that helps people stop drinking by reducing the urge for alcohol will become available in England and Wales today to those who drink at least half a bottle of wine or three pints every day. According to experts, the drug - called nalmefene – reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support. It is said to be suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women. Scroll down for video . The drug - called nalmefene – reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support. It will be available to people in England and Wales from today, having been launched in Scotland last October . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has today published formal guidance recommending the drug, following on from draft guidance released in October, which means that patients have the right to request it if they meet certain requirements. Nalmefene, which also goes by the name Selincro, helps patients gradually cut back on their alcohol intake. Experts said it is not suitable for anyone with a severe alcohol problem who needs to stop drinking immediately. The pill, which costs £3, can be taken up to once a day and is designed to be used whenever the patient wants to stave off the desire to drink. Lyndsey Dudley, a spokeswoman for NICE, said the drug would be suitable for people who 'probably don't even recognise themselves as an alcoholic'. She said: 'It is much like a patch that you might wear to give up smoking to support you to cut down on your alcohol intake. Some days you might feel stronger than others.' Some 2.1 million Britons are believed to be mildly dependent on alcohol and around 35,000 people are expected to be given nalmefene as part of treatment for alcohol dependency in the first year. However, the actual figure might prove to be much lower. Data released yesterday for Scotland, where nalmefene has been approved for use since October last year, shows only 53 people have so far been prescribed the drug. The daily pill, which costs £3, is said to be suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women . The estimate of 35,000 people is based on the prediction that 58,000 people are expected to receive psychosocial intervention for mild alcohol dependency while 60 per cent are expected to be given nalmefene. Ms Dudley said the figure may change as 'people might not want to go down the medication route straight away'. Information given by the drug's manufacturer Lundbeck identifies fictional examples of the sort of people eligible for nalmefene, including Sue, 39, who 'looks forward to a glass of wine after work when the kids go to bed but always finishes the bottle while cooking and eating with her husband, and opens a second bottle a few days each week'. Professor Carole Longson, NICE health technology evaluation centre director, said: 'Many people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem. 'But regularly drinking over the recommended daily amount of alcohol can seriously damage your health. 'Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes. 'We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence. 'When used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial support alone.' Professor Jonathan Chick, a medical adviser for Drinkaware, said: 'Two glasses of wine per day is not by any definition ""mild alcoholism"". 'Nalmefene is for people who are concerned about their drinking, have tried to cut down, have been given brief advice/counselling by their doctor and are still regularly drinking more than low-risk levels. 'The risks start at 14 units per week for women and 21 for men but patients who will be prescribed nalmefene will be drinking higher amounts than that, and will have provoked changes in their brain patterns which have led to difficulty controlling their drinking.'","Nalmefene will be offered to people who drink alcohol regularly from today .

"Doll face: 200,000 people in Iran are having nose jobs each year to mimic the western look . Young women in Iran, some as young as 14, are having cosmetic surgery in the hope of attaining the Hollywood 'doll face'. Iran has been named the nose job capital of the world - with seven times more operations carried out there than in America - despite the high cost of the surgery. Cosmetic procedures cost five to six times the average monthly wage in Iran but according to a report in their . conservative Etemad newspaper, as many as 200,000 Iranians are undergoing rhinoplasty operations every year. The reasons behind the surgery include self-esteem and marriageability, as well as medical issues and the fact that some women in the country find the Islamic practice of the hijab so limiting when it comes to beauty. One woman told The Guardian: 'It's human nature to want to seek out attention with a beautiful figure, hair, skin … but hijab doesn't let you do that. 'So we have to satisfy that instinct by displaying our 'art' on our faces.' The newspaper also reported concerns that the surge in demand has led to a huge increase in unlicensed practioners and means that some people are putting their health at risk in their quest for a new face. In Tehran there are only 157 licensed plastic surgeons but there are 7,000 unlicensed surgeons. Problems associated with botched procedures include respiratory problems, the nose being . dented or malformed, . sinus pain and congestion during the winter months, growth of extra . tissue or bone, and loss of the sense of smell. The prohibitive price has meant that some are also taking out bank loans, often under deception, to fund the surgery. Stand-up comedian Shappi Khorsandi is Iranian-born but does not wear a hijab like many other women from the Islamic republic . But the risks are not putting people off. The Rhinology Research Society of . Iran who conducted the study in co-operation with Johns Hopkins . University in the US found that the rate of nose jobs per capita is . seven times that of America and as prevalent in the the Islamicrepublic . as it is in Brazil. Another anonymous Iranian woman who had a nose job not long ago told The Guardian: 'I do have . a better social life and I don't have to be ashamed of my big, fat nose . anymore. 'In our family, different types of . cosmetic surgery are a totally normal thing, and most of the women and . girls have had their noses done.' While there are benefits, she confesses 'when I get a cold, I get a runny nose - something fierce. I have to be careful then'.","Iranian women strive for Hollywood button-nosed 'doll face'

"They do say a safari trip gets you up close and personal to some of the most beautiful, and yet ferocious wild animals. And in this video, one family show no fear as they hand-feed a tiger from within their tour truck. The unusually close-up footage was captured by a lady who visited Zoobic Safari in Subic Olongapo, Philippines with her five-year-old son earlier this month. There may be bars between tiger and human, but the fingers come worryingly close to the beast's mouth . The tiger eyes up his piece of raw chicken - thankfully it doesn't add human to his meal . There are squeals of delight as the big cat clambers on top of the vehicle, and the lady captures the whole scene on video. The truck accelerates on, but the tiger keeps its balance on the roof, until finally clambering off once the vehicle parks up. The sheer size of the tigers jaws and teeth become apparent as people began to feed raw meat to the big cat. The tiger peers into a packed tourist truck after dismounting from the vehicle's roof . Although bars separate the animal from the tourists, the fingers come a bit too close for comfort to the giant and razor-sharp incisors. The Zoobic Safari is a 25-hectare wildlife sanctuary located in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone  of the country. 'Hold on to your seats as you enter a two-hectare enclosed area aboard our customized Safari Jeep and experience the thrill of being chased by full-grown tigers on the loose,' is how the park's website chillingly describes the trek.","Amazing video shot in Zoobic Safari park in the Philippines .

"Frolicking in the autumn leaves, this little lion cub is having the time of her life as she excitedly plays in her enclosure. Tiny cub Karis proved she's not too dissimilar to human children as she threw herself into the pile of golden leaves carefully collected by her keepers, even ending up with a pile on her head. Staff at the Blair Drummond Safari Park, near Stirling, Scotland, had been raking up the leaves to keep the attraction tidy, when Karis's keeper Brian Reid realised that his little charge might enjoy playing in them and moved the pile into her enclosure. Autumn days: Karis, an 11 week old lion cub, plays in fallen leaves brushed up by keepers in her enclosure at Blair Drummond Safari Park, near Stirling, central Scotland . Adventure: Tiny cub Karis proved that she's not too dissimilar from human children as she threw herself into the pile of golden leaves carefully collected by her keepers . Playtime: Staff at the park had been raking up leaves, when Karis's keeper David Reid realised that his little charge might enjoy playing in them, and moved the pile into her enclosure . The adventurous 11-week-old cub, who was born in September, is proving to be quite the character, with Mr Reid constantly coming up with new ways to entertain her. 'The keepers try to keep things interesting for Karis,' said park manager Gary Gilmour. 'Brian Reid, the head lion keeper, had put a pile of leaves in for her to jump about in. 'We were raking up the leaves at the park as you do at this time of year to keep things tidy and David came up with the idea to pick the leaves up and given them to Karis. 'She's loving them, just like any child would. Handful: The adventurous 11-week-old cub, who was born in September, is proving to be quite the character, with Mr Reid constantly coming up with new ways to entertain her . Mother's daughter: Karis has also enjoyed playing with cardboard boxes, although as she is still so young her mother Teekay is still keeping a watchful eye over the playful cub . 'The keepers use any opportunity to use materials we have to hand and are available.' And it's not just Karis who has been making the most of the autumn, meerkats at the park, which is closed to customers for the winter, have also taken to playing in piles of leaves as they hunt for mealworms to eat. Mr Gilmour said that Karis has also enjoyed playing with cardboard boxes, although as she is still so young her mother Teekay is still keeping a watchful eye over the playful cub. Karis was born on September 10 to Teekay and father Dudley, joining her older sister Libby who was born two years ago. Happy: Karis almost seems to have a smile on her face as she poses in the pile of leaves . Family bond: Karis was born on September 10 to Teekay and father Dudley, joining her older sister Libby who was born two years ago . The cub will grow to around 150kg and brings the Blair Drummond pride to eight lions in total. 'She's doing absolutely great,' said Mr Gilmour. 'She is growing fast, and she has quite a wee temper on her. 'She's just starting to eat meat now.' Karis has been kept away from the rest of the pride since her birth as keepers wait until she is a little bit bigger, although they expect her to be introduced to her fellow lions around Christmas time. Lion Queen: Karis appears to be working on an almighty roar as she leaps through the leaves . 'She's still with her mum but she will be mixed with the group in the next two or three weeks,' said Mr Gilmour. 'We leave it three or four months before we mix them to make sure they're a bit bigger and more robust. 'She's got a big sister Libby who she will be able to play with.' And winter in Scotland might be a long way from the warm plains of Africa, Mr Gilmour said that the lions are not affected by the falling temperatures. 'They're not bothered by the cold the lions, they even like playing in the snow,' he said. 'They're like us though, if it's raining and miserable they will go inside.'","The 11-week-old cub was born in September at Blair Drummond Safari Park .

"The cricketer who bowled the bouncer that critically injured Phillip Hughes has been seen for the first time since the accident. Sean Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground - where the incident happened on Tuesday - with a pair of sunglasses on, flanked by fellow teammates. A day after the horrific accident, Abbott continues to be surrounded by counsellors and teammates amid concerns for the talented paceman's well-being and playing future following the injury to Hughes. Scroll down for video . Sean Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground, where the horrific incident happened . The young cricketer was seen on Wednesday wearing a pair of sunglasses and was flanked by teammates . All NSW and South Australian players are receiving counselling and psychological support in the wake of the delivery that left Hughes in a critical condition. The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely. It was reported Abbott was struggling as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support. '[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his teammates and also the counselling services,' ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson said. 'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.' New South Wales' Sean Abbott (right) bowled the bouncer that hit Phil Hughes on Tuesday . Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him. 'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.' Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and said the incident was not his fault. 'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said. 'I hope he's got support... You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.' There is a long history between Abbott and Hughes who came up through the junior ranks of the NSW cricketing system and are close friends. The 22-year-old made his first-class debut for New South Wales in 2011, and has since played 15 Sheffield Shield matches for his state, taking 38 wickets at an average of 33.94. He broke into the Australian side in the shorter form of the game after being the leading wicket-taker during the 2013-14 domestic One-Day Cup. He made his national debut during Australia's ODI and Twenty20 series with Pakistan in the UAE in October. The sporting community, including Marcus North and Brett Lee, have come out in support of Abbott . Cricket legend Glenn McGrath wrote 'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott' after he paid tribute to Hughes . Former Test bowler Brett Lee said Abbott did not deserve any of the blame for the incident. 'You know you're always on edge bowling fast or being out there batting,' Lee told Channel 9. 'When you see something as shocking as this you really feel for Phil. 'I know first-hand that no one goes out there to try and maim a batsman, no one tries to hurt a batsman.' Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen. Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott. 'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes. Phillip Hughes remains in an induced coma at St Vincent's Hospital in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst .

"The Manhattan Dunkin' Donuts store that made headlines this week when a YouTube user uploaded videos showing a rat infestation has been shut down by the New York City Health Department.

"Two British tourists have died in the Netherlands after snorting what is believed to have been white heroin that was sold to them as cocaine. The men aged 20 and 21 were found dead in an Amsterdam hotel room after taking a deadly batch of drugs just days after Dutch police stopped issuing warnings to holidaymakers. The Foreign Office is liaising with Dutch authorities and is 'providing consular assistance to the family', a spokesman said . Two British tourists have died in Amsterdam (file picture) after snorting what is believed to have been white heroin sold to them as cocaine . One British visitor has died and 14 other tourists - mainly from the UK – have been taken ill in recent weeks after snorting white heroin which is being sold as cocaine. Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said the bodies of the two men, both from England, were found next to traces of a white powder. The men's names have not yet been released by officials. A post-mortem examination is due to be conducted later this week to confirm the time and cause of their deaths. 'We did a quick test to find out what kind of powder it was. It wasn't cocaine, it was an opiate - in this case, white heroin,' Mr van der Veen said. 'We took the sample to the Dutch forensic institute and they found out that the contents of this material is the same contents as other material that we already seized in other cases where people got sick.' He said investigators believe the men were targeted by the same street dealer, or ring of dealers, involved in the death of another Briton last month . Amsterdam police had launched a major public alert targeted at visitors from Britain, many of whom view taking drugs as a big part of the city’s attraction, including English-language matrix-style signs reading: ‘Extremely dangerous cocaine is sold to tourists.’ But after no cases for more than a fortnight, the authorities ended the alert at the weekend – meaning the two Britons found dead in their hotel room on Tuesday after apparently snorting the drug may have been unaware of the warning. Police in the city have now urgently resumed their awareness campaign, putting up posters in hotels and hostels and handing out fliers. There have been at least 14 other cases, although until this week’s tragedy all were found in the street, meaning passers-by were able to raise the alarm. Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said the bodies of the two men, both from England, were found next to traces of a white powder in a hotel in Amsterdam (file picture) Police blame a rogue dealer who is selling white heroin – regarded as a ‘luxury’ version of the drug, which is normally brown-tinged – as cocaine to unsuspecting English-speaking visitors. No arrests have been made, but they believe the dealer is unaware as he is selling at cocaine prices, rather than white heroin which is more expensive. The double tragedy comes a month after a 22-year-old British tourst died after apparently taking cocaine and heroin on a trip to Amsterdam. Joel McDevitt was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city, but discharged himself before he was treated. Officers found him nearby and took him to a police station, where he had to be resuscitated. He was then taken back to hospital, but later died. Mr van der Veen added: ‘The last such incident was two-and-a-half weeks ago, so we hoped he was through the merchandise and stopped the alerts at the weekend. ‘The other cases were people found in the street, but unfortunately these men were staying in a hotel so nobody was aware of what had happened until staff found their bodies.’ Leaflets handed out to visitors since last month at main squares and Amsterdam's Centraal railway station warn: ‘The last couple of weeks several tourists were hospitalized with severe health problems after using cocaine bought on the street. ‘Research has revealed that the cocaine used was not cocaine but white heroin.’ They add that in Amsterdam ‘you won't be arrested for taking drugs’. A UN report named Amsterdam and Antwerp as Europe’s top cities for cocaine use based on analysis of urine in sewage, the equivalent to 1.5 grams per day per 1,000 people.","Two men aged 20 and 21 found dead in a hotel room in Amsterdam .

"Diners at a restaurant in China will no longer have to deal with human errors from their waiters.

The machines navigate their way around with the use of an optical sensing system. Although wages for the robots are non-existent, they still do not come cheap, costing at least £6,000 each. But with a five-year-warranty on each one, and the fact that they only need to be charged four-hours-a-day, the owner Lu Dike, 48, says that in the long-term it will save him a fortune in wages. The machines are a popular draw at the restaurants, with diners wanting to experience being serviced by them. They also have the capability to speak up to 40 phrases in Mandarin Chinese, such as 'enjoy your meal'.

"A Romanian billionaire who paid £20,000 to shoot an elephant has spent another £30,000 to have it stuffed, mounted and sent back to his home. Agriculture magnate Ioan Niculae, believed to be Romania's richest man, gunned down the bull elephant in Hoedspruit, a town in South Africa's Limpopo province in in February last year. It was then collected by a specialist taxidermist who spent seven months stripping the hide of the animal so that it could be dried and refitted in their facility just outside the city of Pretoria. Scroll down for video . Ioan Niculae paid £20,000 to shoot the bull elephant in South Africa. After paying to have it stuffed and mounted it will be transported to his home in Romania . The elephant weighed about four-and-a-half tons when alive, but after the taxidermy was complete it now weighs around half a ton . The elephant's real tusks were removed and replaced with fiberglass replicas, so the originals could be stored in a glass trophy case . The stuffed elephant weighs half a ton... four tons less than it weighed when it was alive . Deiter Ochsenbein, 51, who runs the Highfield taxidermists company which carried out the project, said: 'Stuffing an elephant is a lengthy process.... Alive, the elephant weighed about four-and-a-half tons, but now with all the original interior scraped out and a new fiberglass interior in its place, it weighs about half a ton.' The elephant's real tusks were also replaced with fiberglass replicas, so the real ones could be separately mounted in a glass display case. Ochsenbein added that it took six people to complete the body of the elephant, which was made of 47 different pieces. Niculae, who made his fortune after founding Romania's leading agricultural and fertilizer conglomerate, paid for 19 animals to be stuffed in total . Niculae, who is currently valued at $1.1 Billion by Forbes made his fortune after founding Romania's leading agricultural and fertilizer conglomerate.

"An experimental Ebola vaccine appears safe and triggered signs of immune protection in the first 20 volunteers to test it, U.S. researchers reported Wednesday. The vaccine is designed to spur the immune system's production of anti-Ebola antibodies, and people developed them within four weeks of getting the shots at the National Institutes of Health. Half of the test group received a higher-dose shot, and those people produced more antibodies, said the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Some people also developed a different set of virus-fighting immune cells, named T cells, the study found. 'Seems to work': The first participant enrolled in an investigational Ebola vaccine at the National Institute of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md.  The vaccine now appears safe and triggered signs of immune protection in the first 20 volunteers to test it, U.S. researchers reported Wednesday . Stimulating both types of immune response is 'a promising factor', said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose employees led the work. The researchers reported no serious side effects. But two people who received the higher-dose vaccine briefly spiked fevers — one above 103 degrees — which disappeared within a day. Earlier this month, Fauci told Congress this first-stage testing was promising enough that the U.S. planned much larger studies in West Africa, starting in Liberia in early January, to try to prove whether the vaccine really works. Scientists are racing to develop ways to prevent or treat the virus that has killed more than 5,600 people in West Africa, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Wednesday's publication offered scientific details about the initial testing of the vaccine candidate furthest along, one being developed by NIH and GlaxoSmithKline. Additional safety studies are underway here and abroad. A different Canadian-made vaccine also has begun small safety studies. All smiles: Ebola survivors (from left) Amber Vinson, Dr. Kent Brantly, Nina Pham, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra and Ashoka Mukpo appeared on the Today show on Tuesday for their first ever joint interview . Many questions remain as larger studies are being designed, including the best dose and how soon protection may begin, cautioned Dr. Daniel Bausch, a Tulane University Ebola specialist who wasn't involved in the study. Plus, monkey research suggests a booster shot will be needed for long-term protection. 'The road is still long and there are many challenges but we are nevertheless one step closer to a solution,' he wrote in an accompanying editorial. On Tuesday, six of the seven Americans who contracted Ebola and were successfully treated for the virus appeared together on the Today show. Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, Amber Vinson, Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo appeared for their first ever joint interview. They were not joined by Dr Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who was diagnosed with the virus after returning to New York City from Guinea. He was released earlier this month. Most of the group had been working with Ebola victims in West Africa or in the U.S. when they contracted Ebola, but when asked if they would do the same again, it was unanimous 'yes'.","Vaccine stimulates immune system's anti-Ebola antibodies .

"The Melbourne woman who was rescued after she was swallowed by a three-metre deep sinkhole as she was hanging out the washing has told of the moment she thought she was going to die. Christine Beaumont's oldest daughter Rebecca told the Herald Sun her mother was terrified that no one was able to hear her cry for help as she was submerged in water and had to float on a piece of wood. 'She thought, no one's gonna hear me,' Rebecca said. 'She said she was thinking of all of us [her six children] because she thought she was gonna die.' Mrs Beaumont also says she had spiders crawling on her while she was trapped underground. Scroll down for video . Christine Beaumont of Melbourne was swallowed by a three metre deep sinkhole and thought she was going to die . The sinkhole may appear small in width, but authorities said it was actually at least three metres deep . Mrs Beaumont, a 53-year-old cleaner, was assisting an elderly woman with her washing when the ground gave way beneath her at about 11:30am . The 53-year-old cleaner was assisting an elderly woman in her Springvale home in Melbourne's south-east when the ground gave way beneath her at around 11:30am, the Herald Sun reports. Paramedic Stephanie Palamberis said that at one stage the woman's head was submerged underwater. 'The woman states that she was hanging her washing today over some grass and the ground has just given way from underneath her feet and she's just slid straight down and she's fallen into a pool of water at the bottom,' Ms Palamberis said. 'She was initially submerged, but she managed to get her head back above water, attempted to climb out of the hole and she remained there because she was just too deep.' After about half an hour swimming in the sinkhole, she managed to attract the attention of her neighbours who called 000 around 12:10pm. 'The woman told us she couldn't touch the bottom of the hole, so was trying to swim and stay afloat, to avoid the risk of further mud collapses,' Ms Palamberis said. After about half an hour swimming in the sinkhole, she managed to attract the attention of her neighbours who called 000 around 12:10pm . A Country Fire Authority spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the woman was removed from the sinkhole within 15 minutes of the 000 call. 'The hole was only half a metre wide (at the top), but actually it opens up very big inside, so there was nothing for her to grab on to get herself to try and get herself out,' Paul Carrigg from the Country Fire Authority told the Herald Sun. 'There was only dirt there, and every time she put her hands up, the dirt disappeared.

"Much-maligned Star Wars character Jar-Jar Binks is killed off in a deleted scene leaked from the Phantom Menace. But everything is not as it seems as it appears the scene has been edited by one anti-Binks fan to show the character going to his watery grave. The minute-long clip, apparently scrapped from the 1999 film, opens with Jedis Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) surfacing in their ship with Gungan Jar-Jar Binks on a fast-flowing river. Scroll down for video . Unpopular: Jar-Jar Binks was derided by the Star Wars fan base . Realising their craft is about to be dragged over a waterfall and smashed onto the rocks below, the two Jedis shoot a hook into a brick wall and pull themselves across. A panicky Binks fails to grab hold of the wire in time and as the force of the water pulls the vessel over the waterfall he is heard plummeting to his death. But sharp-eyed Star Wars fans have spied this newly-surfaced clip, shown on digg.com, may not be the whole story. As Sploid reports, this clip is an cut down version of the actual scene which has an extra 20 seconds of footage showing the Jedis pulling a soaked Jar-Jar out of the water before the three of them head away from the shore. It is believed the original scene was released on DVD but then cut from later releases. Fans of the blockbuster films have a long-running dislike of the unpopular character and some hailed the clip as the way the film should have been. One commenter wrote: 'I'm so happy this exists, yet so sad they deleted it.' Another added: 'I don't care if it makes kids cry. That was the Star Wars we deserved.'

"A toy baby will cost American Sniper the Oscar, movie insiders predict. Clint Eastwood's movie  picked up six Academy Award nominations and more at the box office than the other seven nominees combined. But the scene which shows Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller cradling a doll was widely mocked. Anticipating the outcome of this Sunday's ceremony, a panel of experts agreed that one prop is the movie's Achilles Heel. Fatal flaw: This fake baby will prevent American Sniper from winning Best Picture, experts say . In a scene where Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller discuss Chris' duty to the military, a fake was used . The panel assembled by Vanity Fair on Tuesday consisted of movie producer Jennifer Todd, Vanity Fair's Krista Smith, Allison Samuels of the Daily Beast, IndieWire's Anne Thompson, Pete Hammond of Deadline, Fandango's Dave Karger. Best Picture, they say, will be between Boyhood and Birdman. American Sniper would win if it were a public vote, a study showed. But the biopic about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who claimed to have killed 255 people, will be snubbed by the upper echelons of Hollywood, the group agreed. According to Pete Hammond, Eastwood had cast a baby but the child was ill on the day of shooting so he made the fatal error of substituting a plastic doll. The movie stoked heated debate over the morality of war - and the art of prop selection. Feeding: Sienna Miller had the difficult task of playing Taya Kyle and breastfeeding the fake baby . The man on whom it is based, Chris Kyle, was shot and killed by a veteran before the movie was completed . On the same weekend American Sniper hit movie theaters, director Michael Moore tweeted: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' He later claimed that his words were incidental and not aimed at the movie. Seth Rogen also hit out at Eastwood's latest piece, likening it to a violent episode in Quentin Tarantino's Nazi-era movie Inglorious Basterds. But it was that baby that merited unabashed ridicule. The scene involves Cooper, as Chris Kyle, and Miller, as Taya Kyle, having a conversation about him leaving the family and returning to war. Both parents hold their 'baby' daughter as they discuss whether soldiers or Chris' wife and children are more important. A second instance of using a doll instead of a human occurs earlier in the film, when Chris and Taya welcome their baby son into the world. Tough call: Because the babies cast in American Sniper were ill, Eastwood decided to use a doll instead . Nod: The panel of experts believe Julianne Moore can clear shelf space for her Best Actress Oscar already . Favorite: Birdman, starring Michael Keaton, is tipped as one of the two favorites to take Best Picture . Early reviews identified the scene as a major flaw for the Oscar contender. On the website HitFix, for example, reviewer Drew McWeeny wrote, 'I get so distracted by the baby... the entire rest of the scene, that's all I can look at.' 'Neither one of them looks like they are comfortable holding it,' McWeeny continued, speaking on the actors. 'Cooper in particular looks like he's just plain never held a baby.' 'Hate to ruin the fun but real baby #1 showed up with a fever,' script writer Jason Hall tweeted in response to those questioning the choice to use a doll. 'Real baby #2 was no show. (Clint voice) Gimme the doll, kid,' Hall continued in a message published by The Hollywood Reporter. The original tweet has since been deleted. Unanimously, the panel of experts said Patricia Arquette will take home Best Supporting Actress for Boyhood, JK Simmons the equivalent for Whiplash, and Julianne Moore will land the Best Actress award for Still Alice. Ceremony: Neil Patrick Harris is presenting this year's Academy Awards show this Sunday . A Harvard senior and statistics whiz who uses a mathematical model to predict an Oscar nominees chance of winning - and has a 75 percent success rate from previous years - also gave the nod to Birdman for Best Picture. However, Matthew Belloni, executive editor of industry journal The Hollywood Reporter, told AFP: 'Boyhood and Birdman are the frontrunners, and American Sniper is the dark horse.' According to other forecasters, it could be that the top contenders split best picture and best director, as 12 Years a Slave and Gravity did last year. 'It seems a lot of people are saying that if they vote Birdman in one of those two categories, they are going to vote Boyhood in the other,' said Paul Sheehan, editor at awards handicapper GoldDerby.com. But because of the best picture category's preferential ballot, in which members rank their top films rather than vote for just one, a movie that is many people's second choice could prevail. For Sheehan, that's director Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. BEST PICTURE . American Sniper . Birdman . Boyhood . The Grand Budapest Hotel . Whiplash . The Imitation Game . The Theory Of Everything . BEST ACTOR .

The gang fled afterwards with their victims' valuables including cash, credit cards and mobile phones. The women, aged between 30 and 32, were last night receiving counseling. Guerrero state Attorney General Martha Garzon said the motive was ""robbery, and to have fun' with the gang drinking mescal during the attack.

"Michael Phelps' intersex girlfriend was convicted to two years in jail for stealing $10,000 from a businessman, she claims. Taylor Lianne Chandler went by the name David Roy Fitch when, at the age of 19, she blackmailed a man she met in a Maine bar in 1992. It was, she claims, a desperate bid to pay for gender reassignment surgery, which she completed years later before striking up a romance with Olympic gold medalist Phelps. Scroll down for videos . Secrets: Taylor Chandler (left), who claims to be girlfriend to Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps (right) says she was jailed in 1992 for blackmailing a businessman into giving her $10,000 for her corrective surgery . Claims: The 41-year-old wrote on Facebook that she served 30 days before completing two probation years . Shocker: Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler (above) has admitted she was born David Roy Fitch, and had both male and female genitalia . In the dark: Chandler said her new man Phelps (above) was not aware of her past, though there's no actual proof that the two were ever an official item . Her choice: Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia . Feet in the sand: Chandler has since been a champion for gender rights . Chandler only served 33 days in state prison before receiving a two-year probation order. She claims she pleaded for probation after being raped by three men in her cell. She explained on Facebook: 'At 19, I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. 'As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion. 'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. 'Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped. 'I sued the state of Maine and got them to provide training for staff to deal with people on different spectrums of gender. 'They even created new facilities for housing someone with special needs. 'I plead and got probation for two years. I went on the talk show and tabloid TV circuit pleading my case for gender rights. 'After a brutal rape and a horrible trial in 1993 I went away to get my surgery and changed my name to Taylor Lianne Whitney to escape back into anonymity and have a normal life. 'For the last 20 plus years that is exactly what I have done.' The revelation comes a day after Chandler first revealed she was born with both male and female genitalia. As a teenager Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then, in her early twenties, underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia. Chandler was born a male however in name only, and is actually intersex, meaning she had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries. As she explains in a Facebook post, 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.' She then adds, 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.' She is also revealing how in love she is with Phelps, and claims the two clicked after meeting on Tinder. 'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair,' she says. 'I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.' In costume: Chandler dressed as Wonder Woman for Halloween with a pal . Bad night: Chandler (left) claims she was with Phelps (right) the night he was arrested on suspicion of DUI .

She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer. 'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview. 'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Famous friends: Chandler cozies up to RuPaul's Drag Race alum Detox . So sweet: Chandler posted this image of Phelps to her account and wrote about how excited she was to see him again . Now however, Chandler thinks Phelps may 'leave her' after telling her truth. 'I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light,' she says. Her Facebook is a shrine to the swimmer, with his photos plastered all over her wall and banner. She also seems to repost any and all stories that mention their relationship. He's out: Chandler said on her Facebook on Wednesday that Phelps is out of rehab . Still on?: Phelps has yet to comment on any of this . Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland. The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program on Wednesday according to Chandler. The alleged couple also have a bit of an age gap between them, and Phelps is 29 and Chandler is 41-years-old. Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI. Boots for days: Chandler's Facebook page is a shrine to Phelps, with the swimmer's photos everywhere . In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life. 'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains. 'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.' 'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.' 'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.' She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights.","Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler has revealed she was David Roy Fitch when she stole $10,000 and was jailed .

"The BBC is saving £1.1billion a year compared to than seven years ago after slashing 1,000 staff and top talent - but could still have to take the axe to programmes, its finance director has warned. Publishing a new report on ‘BBC efficiency’, Anne Bulford said the corporation still needs to find an extra £400million a year by 2017 and 'the challenge to avoid having to cut content is very real'. The cuts included £35million a year from the £229million-a-year talent budget compared to five years ago, after widespread criticism of high salaries paid to top stars. BBC finance director Anne Bulford (above) said the Corporation needs to save an extra £400million a year . The departures of Susanna Reid and Jeremy Paxman have helped reduce the annual BBC talent budget . Former BBC presenters prompted anger when their salaries were revealed, including the £6million a year reportedly paid to Jonathan Ross before he moved to ITV in 2010. Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman was also thought to be earning more than £500,000 before he left this year - with the highest-paid 'talent' now thought to be stars such as Graham Norton and Jeremy Clarkson. The departure of Susanna Reid, who departed for ITV and a reported £400,000 salary in April, has also helped trim BBC budgets. But because many of the other cuts that were made to date - including more than 1,000 redundancies and a string of property sales - were one-off savings, bosses are expected to target the BBC programming budget next to save more cash. The BBC’s director general Tony Hall has already announced plans to axe youth channel BBC3 and make it online-only, angering many of his own TV presenters. But according to an insider, bosses are prepared to make further ‘tough choices’ in order to save more money, meaning services such as the arts channel BBC4 could also find itself under threat. BBC director general Tony Hall has already announced plans to axe BBC3 and now BBC4 is under threat . A source said yesterday that it is ‘increasingly likely’ that other stations and programmes will be slimmed down or cut as the corporation puts further pressure on its budgets. Although no plans have been drawn up, the BBC would prefer to make a few dramatic cuts, such as by axing an entire channel, than to make many smaller savings to programme budgets. Miss Bulford, who is paid £395,000 as the BBC’s managing director of finance and operations, said: ‘Many savings delivered in this charter period come from structural or one-off initiatives that can’t easily be repeated, making it more likely that content and services will be impacted if the real terms value of the Licence Fee continues to be reduced.’ In recent years, the BBC has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money. The controversial IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative was axed by Lord Hall at a cost of £100million to the licence fee payer. And the corporation was castigated by MPs after a report by the National Audit Office discovered it had handed out £369million in severance payments to its staff over eight years. Stars such as Jack Whitehall, left, have criticised the decision to axe BBC3 and make it online-only . However, Miss Bulford argued that the BBC’s efficiency ‘compares well’ to Government departments and boasted that it is ‘on track’ to achieve £1.5billion in savings by 2017. To save more money, Lord Hall will introduce a ‘compete or compare’ strategy that will force programme makers to slash their costs and compete with independent production companies. The decision to axe BBC3 – which is expected to save around £100million a year – must be approved by the corporation’s governing body before it can go ahead. Stars including comedian Jack Whitehall and DJ Greg James have already criticised the idea in public. In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest.","A new report on BBC efficiency said an extra £400 million had to be cut .

"Iconic '90s model Jodie Kidd, who championed the 'heroin chic' look of the grunge era along with Kate Moss, is making a comeback. She quit the business to compete as a professional motor racing driver at Silverstone and then play polo for England but Kidd is coming full circle and returning to the fashion world after seven years away. The 6ft 2"" mother-of-one, who still boasts the razor-sharp cheekbones she was famed for, has now been signed to Next models. Jodie Kidd is returning to the fashion world after seven years away from the industry . 'Even though I walked away . from [modelling], I was still surrounded by it. I've always loved seeing it all . in magazines, and my sister Jemma is a big make-up artist, so it was . still part of my world. But I saw a big resurgence of my friends - Erin . [O'Connor], Karen Elson, Guinevere [Van Seenus] - in magazines. There . seemed to be this huge revival, with the public falling in love with . them again, and they all look so bloody amazing!' the 34-year-old tells Time Out. 'It was so refreshing, as a . consumer, to be looking at a beautiful woman for once, rather than a . teenager. When I was modelling, I was a skinny little 16-year-old girl, . supposedly selling clothes to 40-year-old women. I love seeing these . women - not girls - modelling fashion,' she says. Kidd, who features on the cover of this week's issue of the listings magazine, started out as a waifish teenager, but is now happy that 'proper, grown up' women are being chosen for fashion campaigns. Kidd enjoyed the perks of modelling but after a while became disillusioned and left to explore other careers . She enjoyed the glamorous side of the job, such as drinking and partying with the Rolling Stones, and working for then-up and coming designers Alexander McQueen, Julien Macdonald and Matthew Williamson. But Kidd was disillusioned abut the rewards hard work would bring. The control she had over her sporting career meant it was more fulfilling for her in that respect. Kidd, still stunning at 34, has signed up to Next models and says modelling is her priority now . 'Fashion was always something I had to . learn. I would turn up and put 110 percent in, and be on time with clean . hair and a full night's sleep. But it wouldn't necessarily make any . difference at all, and you could easily lose out to someone who'd just . come in stinking of booze. I had to learn that you can't do a ""good . job"". With animals, what you put in is what you get out. As a competitor . - showjumping and racing cars - I have the control. With modelling, you . just had to sit there. It wasn't possible to have ambitions.' While modelling is top priority for her career at the moment, Kidd says she would love to go back on Top Gear.

"White air passengers are routinely stopped and searched by customs officials simply to ensure the right racial ‘mix’ of travellers are being  approached, a report reveals today. It found staff searching for illegal goods at Gatwick Airport selected white passengers to balance the numbers against black and other ethnic minorities they suspected to help avoid race discrimination complaints. Details of the practice are exposed in one of two highly critical reports by John Vine, chief inspector of the UK Border Agency, who said it was unlawful and must stop. Checks: White air passengers are routinely stopped and searched by customs officials simply to ensure the right racial 'mix' of travellers at Gatwick Airport (pictured) The second, criticising Heathrow Terminal 3, raised concerns about queues at the borders and found staff were allowed to clock off at some of the busiest times, resulting in long delays for passengers. Targets for queuing  times for passengers from outside the European Economic Area were breached 62 times between September 18 and 30 last year. A watchdog report has revealed that rota changes and staff numbers could both be key factors in the recent chaos at passport control. Alterations in the rota mean that staff are clocking off at the start of busy periods, leaving on duty border officers to deal with the deluge of passengers. It also found that staff numbers at Heathrow Terminal 3 fell by 15 per cent in a year. Low levels of staffing could also be a contributing factor to the fiasco has become increasingly . embarrassing in the run-up to the Olympics, prompting fears that Britain . will become a laughing stock as half-a-million spectators arrive here . from around the world. The rota revelations will no doubt incense passengers who have spent hours waiting to clear the checks - last week it was revealed that passengers were storming past border guards at Britain's airports in frustration at lengthy queues at passport control. The longest wait was two hours and 15 minutes. The racial scanning, seemingly widespread at Gatwick, involved pulling out white passengers when officials wanted to question a black passenger. One official told inspectors he and his colleagues ‘specifically detained a number of white passengers’ from one flight so they could ‘show that white people were also being questioned’. He said that when they saw arrivals they ‘knew they had a problem’ because the person they wanted to intercept was the only black passenger on the flight. The inspectors added: ‘The officer also reported that this practice ... is also used for Caribbean flights to reduce the potential for future race claims.’Mr Vine said the approach was ‘not justifiable’ and that there was ‘no legal basis for detaining people for such purpose’. At Heathrow Terminal 3, inspectors found two-thirds of passenger searches were ‘neither justified nor proportionate or in line with legislation and agency guidance’. The reports reveal a number of other areas where the border controls at Britain’s two biggest airports are failing. At Heathrow Terminal 3, they raised . questions over immigration controls, with the number of people refused . entry by border staff falling by 20 per cent from 2009/10 to last year. The numbers kicked out of the country after being blocked at the terminal border fell by one third. Mr Vine questioned whether the UK Border Agency was still able to maintain ‘an effective and efficient border control’. At . Gatwick’s North Terminal, inspectors found passengers arriving from . outside the EU were routinely allowed to enter through the ‘nothing to . declare’ channel with too much alcohol and up to three times the legal . amount of cigarettes. Staggeringly, customs officers waved through passengers found with cannabis in their luggage, instead of arresting them. The report said they had failed to follow ‘appropriate procedures’ and the passengers should have been arrested. Inspectors reported ‘an almost total lack of visible detection presence’ in customs for ‘large parts of the day’. And too many suspected illegal migrants were being allowed through, including cases where attempted deception and breaches of immigration rules were clear, it found. The reports are published today as two major immigration unions – the PCS and Immigration Services Union – walk out on strike.","Report finds white passengers are searched to balance out other ethnicities .

"New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has laughed off allegations that his team used illegal deflated footballs in their 45-7 thrashing of the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game on Sunday night. In a Monday morning radio interview with WEEI, Brady was still riding high on clinching his record sixth trip to the Super Bowl and refused to comment on the NFL's investigation of whether his team at doctored game balls so they were easier to catch and throw. 'I think I’ve heard it all at this point,' he said today. 'That’s the last of my worries. I don’t even respond to stuff like this.' The NFL has confirmed it is investigating the case. Footage from the Fox Sports broadcast shows referees took at least one football out of play on Sunday night. They later turned over the ball to the NFL so officials could weigh it. Scroll down for video . In the third quarter of Sunday night's game, referees took the Patriots' ball out of the game and replaced it with another. According to reports, the ball was taken in to be weighed . The referee snatched the ball the Patriots had used on the field and threw it to an official on the sidelines. He then replaced it with a different ball . The NFL is reportedly investigating whether the New England Patriots illegally deflated footballs in their victory over the Colts, which secured their a spot in the Super Bowl; pictured above is Rob Gronkowski . New scrutiny: Head coach Bill Belichick - who has lead the Patriots to six Super Bowls in 14 seasons - was fined $500,000 in 2007 for videotaping sideline coaches during a game . NBC blog Pro Football Talk reports that the league is examining several footballs from the game. The claims are especially damaging because the Patriots have already been caught cheating once before. In 2007, the NFL fined the team and head coach Bill Belichick for videotaping an opposing team's sideline coaches during a game. The practice, which is against the rules, gave Patriots coaches insight into the plays that the defense was about to make. Indianapolis columnist Bob Kravitz of WTHR TV has claimed a source has told him that NFL officials are investigating New England for ball tampering. Officials reportedly took a ball out of play to check whether it weighed the league-required 12 and a half to 13 and a half pounds. Kravitz tweeted: 'The NFL is investigating the possibility.' If the Patriots are found to have been using deflated balls, they will likely be fined at least one draft pick. The suggestion has promptly been dubbed 'deflate-gate.' The Colts have not responded to the claims. NFL rules require that each team bring 12 Wilson footballs to the game to be used by their own offense. The footballs are weighed and tested by officials prior to the game. In 2012, the University of Southern California Trojans were penalized and an assistant was fired after the team was caught playing with deflated footballs. Deflated footballs are easier to throw and catch in windy conditions. In 2012, USC was fined for deflating footballs; pictured above Patriot's player Nate Solder surges towards the touchdown line against the Colts . Brady and Belichick have built an incredible run at New England. In 14 seasons together, they have recorded only one losing record and missed the playoffs just three times . The Patriots are infamous for SpyGate which occurred before their fist Super Bowl in January 2002 - the team were accused of filming Rams' practices; pictured above, New England quarterback Tom Brady holds up the championship trophy following the AFC Championship game on Sunday . Teams frequently vary the weight of their footballs - within league rules - to suit their quarterbacks and the conditions on the field. Most NFL pundits agree that deflating footballs would not have given the Patriots so much of an advantage as to be the cause of the 38-pound thrashing that the team handed to the Colts on Sunday night. And regardless of the outcome of any investigation, the result of the game is final. The Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix on February 1. Seattle Seahawks who won their spot earlier in the day with an amazing comeback performance again overtime victory against the Green Bay Packers. The Patriots are already one of the most despised teams in football - both because of their consistent, enviable success and previous allegations of cheating and misdeeds by coach Belichick. In addition to the 2007 'Spygate' scandal, the Patriots were accused of filming the St. Louis Rams practice prior to Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 - a claim that was later found not to be true by the NFL. And just last week, the Ravens accused the team of deceit and trying to confuse officials. The Patriots yesterday won their eighth AFC championship - their sixth under Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick . Players were mobbed by fans after the game. It's the eighth time the Patriots have won the AFC Championship . An ecstatic Tom Brady spoke to reporters after leading the Patriots to victory against the Colts .

Fans rushed to congratulate the Patriots after their 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts . Tom Brady threw for three touchdowns and LeGarrette Blount ran in three more to lead his team to their 45-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. New England opened a 14-point lead in the first half and then ran away with the game, with three third-quarter touchdowns and another to start the fourth. That made it the second-most lopsided game in AFC championship history. Brady completed 23 of 35 passes for 226 yards. Blount ran 30 times for 148 yards. Andrew Luck completed 12 of 33 passes for 126 yards with two interceptions for the Colts. Earlier in the day the Seahawks confirmed their spot with a stunning comeback against Green Bay in the NFC championship game. Russell Wilson hit Jermaine Kearse for a 35-yard touchdown, just over three minutes into overtime to lift the Seattle Seahawks to an improbable 28-22 victory. The victory reduced Wilson to tears.

"Christa Engles, 26, died after being shot in the head at her home in Tulsa, Oklahoma . This is the first photo of an army veteran mom who was accidentally shot dead by her toddler son as she changed her daughter's diaper.

Her body was found by her mother-in-law, who lives with the family. Police said that the three-year-old tried to leave the home after the killing. Neighbors told the local KRJH TV station that the child had found the handgun under the couch in the home. On Facebook, Engles is pictured wearing Army fatigues - The Tulsa World confirmed she was an enrolled military member.

In a social media post after her death was confirmed he said: 'I lost my wife to an accident yesterday. 'Don't forget to tell your loved ones they are loved. You really never know when the last 'I love you' really is the last.' On Wednesday he wrote: ''It's a new day, it will be my first without you,' her devastated husband wrote on Facebook.

"A British father has made medical history by having his healthy prostate removed after discovering that he carries a defective gene that boosts his risk of cancer, it was reported last night. The businessman’s increased risk of cancer through the BRCA2 gene is believed to  have come to light when he  took part in a trial at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London. He entered the trial because he has relatives who have suffered from breast or prostate cancer in the past. Scientists believe that others who know they are carriers will choose to go down the same route (stock image) The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to be linked to an aggressive form of breast cancer. Last week Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had had surgery to remove both her breasts to reduce the risk of getting breast cancer after testing positive for the rogue BRCA1 gene. In the latest case, the Briton, 53, who is married with children, asked to have his prostate removed so that he could avoid the fate of his relatives. It is understood that doctors were initially reluctant to perform the operation as removal of the prostate leaves men infertile and can also result in incontinence. It is believed there were no signs to suggest the man’s prostate was unhealthy. Angelina Jolie chose to have a double mastectomy as her chance of developing breast cancer was very high . Roger Kirby, the surgeon who performed the procedure, told The Sunday Times: 'the relatively low level of cancerous cells we found in this man's prostate before the operation would these days not normally prompt immendiate surgery to remove the gland, but given what we do know about the nature of BRCA2, it was definitely the right thing to do for this patient.' Following the surgery, a number of previously undetected BRCA cells were discovered. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have prostate cancer for many years. Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis). When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied. However, these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer. It is more likely they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement). NHS Choices . Experts say that knowing you are a carrier of the cells is difficult, and that they believe other men may now follow suit. Prostate cancer affects one in eight men in the UK and there are 10,000 deaths each year. Angelina Jolie announced earlier this week that she had a double mastectomy as she was a carrier of the BRCA1 gene. The 37-year-old actress's decision was made all the more poignant by the fact that Angelina lost her mother Marcheline Bertrand to ovarian cancer when she was just 56. She paid tribute to her husband Brad Pitt and family who supported her decision. In an editorial piece in the New York Times entitled 'My Medical Choice', Angelina wrote: 'I am fortunate to have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and supportive. 'So to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through this, know that you are a very important part of the transition. Brad was at the Pink Lotus Breast Center, where I was treated, for every minute of the surgeries. Following the operations, Angelina's risk of contracting breast cancer has now dropped to under five per cent. She wrote: 'My doctors estimated that I had an 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.

"The heartbroken parents of a 14-year-old boy murdered by an 'online predator' are suing two police forces they say failed to stop his killing. Breck Bednar was brutally stabbed to death by Lewis Daynes, an older teenager he met playing violent computer games on the internet. Breck's parents Barry Bednar and Lorin LaFave went to police in Surrey two months before his killing and told them he was being groomed by an older man over the internet. After Daynes pleaded guilty to the murder yesterday, it emerged the couple are now suing Surrey Police and Essex Police over their handling of the case. Barry Bednar and Lorin LaFave, the parents of Breck Bednar, are suing Surrey Police and Essex Police over the murder of their son by an internet predator . Breck (left) met 19-year-old Lewis Daynes (right) online after joining a gaming group to play Battlefield 4 . Breck is believed to have met Daynes when he joined an online gaming group  run by the older teenager. His parents, who are from the US but live in Caterham, Surrey, raised the alarm after noticing a change in the once committed student's behaviour. They went to police in December last year, two months before Breck's murder in February this year. After his death, his mother said: 'Like most teenagers, socialising, computers and games were what he enjoyed. 'The problem was a predator who was trying to control his ideology about religion, government, family and education. 'Breck looked up to him because of his interesting manner and computer skills. Breck couldn't see the bad and when I pointed out his obvious lies, they were overlooked by Breck, his friends and, unfortunately, the police.' The family believe that despite their pleas, no action was taken by Surrey Police to prevent Daynes carrying out his crime. The family also accuse Essex Police of failing to share information with Surrey Police in relation to the case. Mr Bednar and Ms LaFave say Surrey Police failed to act and Essex Police did not share information . Surrey Police is also being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the murder. An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Essex Police have been notified of a civil claim against the force and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.' Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, of Surrey police, said that since the murder the force had reviewed its call-handling procedures and implemented changes to improve the way information was handled and shared. He said: 'This has been a tragic case and our thoughts remain with Breck's friends and family. In December 2013 a call was made to Surrey police by a relative of Breck expressing concerns around online grooming, and due to the prior contact the case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 'They have since decided to conduct an independent investigation into the actions taken by Surrey police following this communication. We will fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation.' Breck told his parents he was going to a sleepover with friends before travelling to Daynes' flat in Grays, Essex (pictured), where he was stabbed in the neck in a 'sexually or sadistically motivated' attack .","Breck Bednar, 14, knifed to death by internet predator Lewis Daynes .

"Is there a sweeter, more seductive sound than the opening of a new toy or gadget? Not to a select group of professional 'unboxers' and the millions of people who watch their videos on YouTube. With the holidays nearly upon us and with them the start of the busiest shopping season, unboxing videos are more popular than ever, according to YouTube, which estimated that the video category received 57per cent more views this year than last. For the uninitiated, unboxing is the recording and sharing of the big reveal of a newly-acquired item, whether it's Dad behind the camera on Christmas Day or a geek reviewer fawning for his tech-specific fans. Scroll down for video . New game: Lewis Hilsenteger (pictured) is the founder of Unbox Therapy, where he unveils a wide range of tech and other products on YouTube . While not the most popular activity on the site, unboxing is up there and has enjoyed steady growth since such videos first surfaced, believed to be in 2006. The phenomenon covers everything from Happy Meals to gaming consoles, usually in minute detail accompanied by either great goofiness or hardcore earnestness - or both. Unboxing videos feature a wide variety of subjects, including wide-eyed toddlers who have just discovered the surprise hidden inside a chocolate egg cracked open by disembodied hands, or eager consumers who love nothing more than ripping the plastic wrap off plug-ins and cables. Product reviewers young and older soak up advertising dollars through the unboxing of swag provided them by the makers of stuff. And their allure has not been lost on brands looking to sell, sell, sell on social media. One in five consumers in a recent survey done by Google, which owns YouTube, said they've watched at least one unboxing video. As of mid-November, there were more than 20 million search results on YouTube for the keyword 'unboxing.' Screen time: Marques Brownlee (pictured) is one of the top tech unboxers with nearly two million YouTube subscribers . 'They're definitely integral to the way I buy things,' said 20-year-old Willy James, a YouTube fan from Pittsburgh who is particularly fond of user MKBHD (aka Marques Brownlee), one of the site’s top tech unboxers with nearly two million YouTube subscribers. 'They're definitely integral to the way I buy things,' said 20-year-old Willy James, a fan in Pittsburgh of MKBHD (aka Marques Brownlee), one of the top tech unboxers with nearly two million YouTube subscribers. 'They're therapeutic. My favorite is when they're doing the tablet reviews and they peel off the layer of plastic film on the glass. I check the unboxing videos before I check an actual company website,' he added. Grand opening: In one video, Mr Brownlee is seen unwrapping a Google Nexus tablet . While some might view unboxing as commercialism run amok, the unboxers themselves insist their videos are all about the emotion involved in the act of opening a new item. 'I'm doing this in spite of a great urgency within myself to rip this box open and get to my iPhone,' declares one unboxer who stretched his video – which even features the item’s packaging and shipping - to 18 minutes and 50 seconds. He made sure to take his time to combine the experience with that of another YouTube phenom, ASMR, the video-sharing shorthand for the controversial autonomous sensory meridian response. It's a specific tingling in the body that cult followers believe is brought on by whispering and certain sounds shared in videos also intended to help people fall asleep. 'I wonder if the box sounds any different now that it's empty?' muses our soft-spoken sharer, with only his hands present on screen as he presses lightly on the tape-fringed flaps of his cardboard shipping box to create a scrape-crunch. Egg on: DC Toys Collector (recently renamed from DisneyCollector), a channel that shows an anonymous woman's hands opening children's playthings, had nearly four million views just in October . 'You've got your full-time unboxers in search of a living, your companies looking to cash in and some professional comics looking for a laugh, but you've also got your random folk who want to freeze that special moment, said Matt McLernon, a Google spokesman. 'It's one of the larger trends on YouTube,' he said. 'You can unbox a cellphone, a vinyl record, a Happy Meal. It's not just over-the-top consumerism as much as it's feeling this connection with the thing that you're watching.' Like most phenoms, unboxing videos have spawned a backlash. 'It even comes with an extra long twisty tie,' jokes one tongue-in-cheek parody video, complete with magical music. Posted in 2011, it has earned several thousand comments both pro and con on unboxing. Small package: A Happy Meal unboxing video, posted by Mr Hilsenteger in 2012, has garnered more than 700,000 views . Lewis Hilsenteger, 29, in Toronto is the open-faced Everyman on the popular Unbox Therapy channel, which has more than 1.6 million subscribers. He said he was motivated to 'go pro' on unboxing nearly four years ago after becoming a fan of such videos. Primarily tech-focused, his regularly posted videos on the channel have surpassed 211 million views, including a huge bump when he showed himself bending an iPhone 6 plus with his bare hands. Before he hit it large on YouTube, the art school grad had a downtown shop where he repaired computers and mobile phones. 'If I'm not into it, there's no video. I have to be excited about it,' Mr Hilsenteger said, describing his audience as largely male between 18 and 40. And then there was that time in March when he and his adorable son, who was 4 at the time, unboxed a giant Gummy Bear, with each chomping on an ear. 'The unboxing video sort of fits in between what a brand wants you to know about a product and what it will feel like for you to have it,' Mr Hilsenteger said. 'That's what I like about it. It's my reaction, which is impossible to fake.'","The phenomenon covers everything from gaming consoles to Happy Meals .

"Cash machines stopped working in rebel-held areas of Ukraine today and businesses no longer accepted credit cards after Kiev moved to shut down the banking system. The measures form part of the government's new strategy to suffocate Russian separatists after its costly military campaign has foundered. Authorities have also pulled funding for all state services such as schools and hospitals  in the apparent hope the  population will rise up against the insurgents. In the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, dozens of people were today queuing up in the biting cold outside banks around the city after the ATMs stopped functioning. Left out in the cold: People wait in front of a closed bank in the rebel-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk after cash machines were shut down by the Kiev government in a new strategy to isolate Russian separatists . Cut off: The vast majority of businesses said their credit card systems were no longer working in the city . 'I came here at 5am to start queueing up,' retiree Nina sai, as she waited outside a closed branch of Russian-owned bank Sberbank in the hope that it would open later in the day. Inside, tellers said that they had been ordered to stop operations yesterday by Ukraine's central bank. 'We received the order to close the establishment yesterday. 'There are no more money transfer here,' said Valery, a worker at state-run Oschadbank, which was open but not providing cash withdrawals. Ukraine's central bank yesterday ordered all banks to 'suspend' their operations in the rebel-held areas as part of a push by Kiev to isolate the separatist regions. The move followed a November 14 decree by President Petro Poroshenko that also pulled the plug on all social services, such as schools and hospitals, in the towns under insurgent control. In Donetsk, where shelling between government forces and rebels rumbles on in outlying districts, the vast majority of businesses said their credit card systems were no longer working. 'It worked for half-an-hour this morning but now it seems like it has finished,' said Pavel Yalanbenko, an employee at the Amstor supermarket in the city centre. Frustrated: A woman tries and fails to get cash out of an ATM after Ukraine's central bank ordered all banks to 'suspend' their operations in the region . Impasse: The central bank has said that banking services will only be restored when the areas come back under Ukrainian control, an unlikely scenario as the Kremlin-backed rebels have solidified their power . Only a small handful of hotels and shops said that they could still process card payments Wednesday. The central bank has said that banking services will only be restored when the areas come back under Ukrainian control, an unlikely scenario as the Kremlin-backed rebels have solidified their power. Over 4,300 people have been killed and some one million displaced by over seven months of brutal fighting between government forces and insurgents. However, if President Petro Poroshenko hopes to turn people in eastern Ukraine against the separatist leadership, evidence on the ground suggests the strategy may only be hardening their resolve. Donetsk retiree Georgy Sharov said: 'What Poroshenko is saying to us is: ""You are no longer Ukrainians. You won't get pensions, you won't get social payments. 'When you croak, then we'll stop this war against you. But I don't want to go to Ukraine and beg for their mercy.' Could backfire: If President Petro Poroshenko hopes to turn people in eastern Ukraine against the separatists, evidence on the ground suggests the strategy may only be hardening their resolve . The lines have typically formed in front of cash machines belonging to state savings bank Oshchadbank, which handles pensions and social support payments. 'Even they don't always have money,' said Donetsk resident Sergei Smotovsky, standing outside a branch of the bank. 'The worst thing is that not only can you not get social payments. You can't even withdraw money that you earned, your salary.' Even though cash machines don't work, account-holders wait from early morning until lunchtime in the hope that bank workers will top them up, but the doors to the banks often remain firmly shut. Despite the unremitting fighting taking place across Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions affected by the armed separatist conflict, large supermarkets are still reasonably stocked. Supplies come from other parts of Ukraine and customers often use bank cards to pay for shopping. Ukraine's government is now about to block bank cards, cutting off another means of sustenance. Hard-pressed recipients of state benefits have for months turned expectantly to the rebel government for cash. Crowds of pensioners and single mothers assemble daily before the separatist headquarters. When anybody in the crowd becomes especially vocal, one of the gunmen guarding the building rushes to bundle them away, accusing them of being 'provocateurs.' The brunt of the rage, however, is still directed at the Ukrainian government. 'Ukraine says Donetsk is Ukrainian territory, and yet they came here with tanks and weapons instead of paying pensions properly,' said Donetsk retiree Anatoly Visly. 'I am a disabled veteran and I haven't received my pension for three months.' Many pensioners have re-registered in towns outside rebel zones, meaning payments have still accrued to their accounts. The challenge for those people will now become making the monthly trip to banks in government-controlled areas, which can be costly and difficult, especially for the most infirm. Prospects for the rebels to set up a welfare system any time soon are bleak. Conflict: A Russian T-72 tank  moves along a snow-covered avenue in the district of Kievsky in Donetsk, where shelling between government forces and rebels rumbles on . Over 4,300 people have been killed and some one million displaced by over seven months of brutal fighting between government forces and insurgents . Anna Kharzhevskaya, an official with the rebel social affairs and labor ministry, said separatist authorities have only a crude notion of how many people are eligible for social payments. Ukraine's government has been blocking access to state records and is trying to spirit away hard copies of databases still in rebel-held areas, Kharzhevskaya said. Separatist authorities say militiamen are under instructions to stop any unsanctioned removals of government records by Ukrainian authorities. Without a properly functioning tax system in place, there is no immediately obvious and transparent way for money to be raised. As a result, Kharzhevskaya said she could not estimate when her department would begin paying regular pensions. Things are even grimmer in the Luhansk region. Separatist command there is divided fractiously among the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic and an assortment of armed Cossack leaders. One Cossack commander, Pavel Dryomov, had to admit to rebel media that he had overextended himself in promising 500 hryvnia one-off payments ($35) to pensioners — grossly miscalculating the number of people who needed to be paid. 'We had no idea of that figure,' he said in a video interview. If hospitals are still working, it is in large part down to the sheer determination of the staff. Viktoria Lubintseva, director of Donetsk central hospital, said the government had stopped providing funding since the start of November, well before Poroshenko announced the cutoff of state support. 'Medicine is usually bought by the patients as we need different kinds of medicines to do operations,' Lubintseva said. 'Staff is working voluntarily because they sincerely want to help people, as their conscience dictates.' As state support and cash supplies dwindle, reliance is growing on outside aid. Some of it is coming from Russia, but there are also substantial supplies being provided by the charitable fund of billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, whose wealth is built on eastern Ukraine's vast industrial resources. Despite such help, many in eastern Ukraine plan to leave: 'It is impossible to live here,' Smotovsky said as he waited in vain outside the bank.","Ukraine government orders banks to 'suspend' operations in rebel areas .

"Parents can rely too much on technology to entertain children these days so a mother-of-two has published a book on how to get your kids back to the good old-fashioned way of playing - by using their imagination. Neva Elliott with her two kids Josie and Ryan . Photographer Neva Elliott knows all too well how easy it is to plonk your kids in front of the TV with the busy schedule she leads with her four-year-old daughter, Josie, and two-year-old son Ryan. But the Gold Coast woman wanted her kids to experience the imaginative play that she enjoyed throughout her childhood and says her family now lives in a more harmonious household.

'I thought the playing side of things came easily to children before I had kids but when I became a parent I found myself turning the TV on too often,' she said. 'They need to look, listen, touch, feel and taste things and I think watching TV is such a passive form of entertainment that they really don't learn much about the world - they learn through tangible types of things.' But this is not to say that the TV never goes on in the Elliott home. 'They still watch it occasionally - just not as much as they used to,' she said. 'It takes a little bit more effort to get them to do imaginative sorts of things but it's just a habit that you have to get into.' Neva's mother's words of wisdom have always stayed with her since she was a little girl: 'Teach to entertain yourself and you have a friend for life.' 10 WAYS TO GET YOUR KIDS OUTDOORS THIS SUMMER .

"America's long-standing fixation with impossibly white teeth is leading some to develop what dentists refer to as 'bleachorexia.' According to Los Angeles-based cosmetic dentist Laurence Rifkin, over-bleaching is an all too common practice; one that causes severe and permanent damage by stripping tooth enamel and causing gums to recede. 'Once the enamel has been chemically eroded away, then it’s gone, it’s gone forever,' Mr Rifkin, who has even encountered people rubbing Clorox on their teeth in a desperate bid for a megawatt smile, tells Yahoo News. Scroll down for video . Painfully white: According to cosmetic dentist Laurence Rifkin, over-bleaching is an all too common practice; one that causes severe and permanent damage by stripping enamel and causing gums to recede . Fifteen years of bleachorexia? World Boxing Council champion Mia St. John, pictured (left) in 1999 and (right) in 2014, admits she was so obsessed with over-bleaching her teeth, they were in danger of turning to 'mush' World Boxing Council champion Mia St. John tells Yahoo that she became so obsessed with over bleaching her teeth, her dentist had to intervene. 'He said my teeth could basically turn to mush just because I was destroying the enamel,' she reports. Carbamide peroxide, the bleaching agent used in most whitening treatments, can make the teeth brittle and chalky, leading to hypersensitivity. According to a recent survey conducted by the American Association of Cosmetic Dentistry, 96per cent of adults believes a good smile can make a person more attractive, and 74per cent consider a bad one to be a career disadvantage. All those questioned said that if they could improve one thing about their smile, it would be whiter teeth. Which is probably why Americans spend $1.4 billion annually on tooth whitening products, a 300per cent rise since 1996, and why many are ignoring product guidelines and bleaching their teeth more frequently than is recommended. Way back when: Countless Hollywood stars over the years have refused to settle for their natural tooth shades, including Kate Beckinsale (left) in 1998, Blake Lively (center) in 2005, and George Clooney (right) in 2000 . Don't be fooled! These stars may now sport blindingly-white nashers (all pictured in 2014), but this is most likely down to porcelain veneers rather than over-bleaching . So how do you know if you're overdoing it with the carbamide peroxide? Spoiler - if you are exceeding the number of regular treatments advised by your dentist, or with your at-home-whitening products, you probably are. The main warning signs are excessive sensitivity, gum irritation and translucent blotches appearing on the teeth, Van Haywood, DMD, a professor in the Department of Oral Rehabilitation at the Medical College of Georgia, writes for Wedmd. 'Some people's teeth get more transparent if you continue whitening,' he states. 'You can see right through them and see the dark shadows of your mouth.' Cautionary tale: In one of TV show Friends' most memorable episodes, Ross Geller leaves on his at-home whitening treatment for too long and ends up in quite the predicament . It should also be remembered that depending on your teeth's natural shade, brightening them up to white-as-snow levels is actually near-impossible, no matter how much you frazzle them with bleach. Most of the megawatt smiles we see paraded by celebrities from Kim Kardashian and Blake Lively to Brad Pitt and George Clooney are the results of porcelain veneers, not bleach. Veneers are thin shells of medical-grade ceramic that are attached to the front surfaces of teeth, and will set you back anywhere from $800 to $2,500 per tooth. New York-based cosmetic dentist Dr Jennifer Jablow, who is thought to have first coined the term 'bleachorexic' in 2005, assures, however, that with caution and realistic expectations, getting your teeth a few shades lighter can be pretty risk-free. 'Bleaching is very effective in moderation, and it's safe in moderation,' she told ABC last year. 'It's when you're bleaching all the time, beyond what is recommended, that's when you run into problems.'","Bleaching your teeth more often than is recommended can erode tooth enamel permanently .

"San Diego State University has suspended all fraternity activities after members allegedly threw eggs and waved sex toys at women protesting rape on campus. The move by leaders of the school's Greek community comes just days after the University of Virginia also suspended its fraternities after a student said that she was gang raped at a frat house. SDSU officials stepped in after male students from two different fraternities yelled obscenities and threw eggs at woman taking part in a Take Back the Night march. As part of the event, students march through campuses to protest sexual assaults. Just 24 hours after the march, a student at the university reported that she was raped at a party near campus - the seventh such report made since September, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Suspended: All fraternity social activities have been suspended at San Diego State University (pictured) following reports of sexual assaults. Last week, women protesting sexual abuse were pelted with eggs . Hours later, a 19-year-old woman reported that six men tried to pull her into their car near campus, but she managed to escape unharmed, the paper reported. In light of the incidents, the university's InterFraternity Council announced on Tuesday that it is suspending all fraternity social activities until members undergo sexual assault prevention training, which will also teach them how to respond if they witness dangerous behavior. 'It was time to really address these issues,' J. Cole, student president, told the San Diego Union-Tribune. 'We take those allegations very seriously. We've seen this spike in sexual assault reports.' University President Elliot Hirshman gave his support, saying in a statement: 'We must work as one community to create the substantive changes necessary to end sexual violence on our campus.' UVa shut down fraternity activities after Rolling Stone published a piece describing a woman's account of a brutal gang rape by seven men in September 2012 and what the magazine called a hidden culture of sexual violence. Speaking out: Protestors carry signs and chant slogans in front of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia on Saturday night after Rolling Stone reported on a gang rape at the residence . Tagged: The Phi Kappa Psi house has also become a target for graffiti after a student identified only as 'Jackie' told the story of how she was raped by seven brothers at the fraternity in September 2012 . The university's President Teresa Sullivan has asked police to investigate the alleged rape at the Phi Kappa Psi house, and the school has temporarily banned fraternity activities. The article says school administrators and students keep sexual assaults quiet. Sullivan, however, said the university takes sexual misconduct seriously.

"The family of a severely disabled teenager who has the mental age of a five-year-old were left furious after benefits officers demanded the girl be put through a fitness-to-work assessment. Ellie McDonald, 19, suffers from the extremely rare genetic disorder called Chromosome 7 Deletion, which means she is unable to eat, sleep or walk without the help of mother Louise. In preparation for Ellie leaving her special needs school, her mother and her full-time carer applied for employment support allowance (ESA) to replace their child benefit payments. But the family were shocked to be told Ellie would need to be tested to rule out her being fit for work - a process Miss McDonald branded 'bureaucracy gone mad'. Now, since reports of Ellie's situation came to light, the Department of Work and Pensions have said she is no longer required to do a Work Capability Assessment. Louise McDonald is angry that her daughter Ellie - who has a mental age of five and cannot walk or eat without help - has been told she will have to undergo a fitness-to-work assessment . The family, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, hit out the government's refusal to realise that Ellie, who cannot read or write and needs around the clock care, is entirely unfit to work. They had been told they would have to wait up to a year to receive medical tests, in which time they would have missed out on around £200 a month they were entitled to. Miss McDonald, 42, said: 'Ellie is completely reliant on us - she is unable to do anything for herself and has been in care from birth. 'Two weeks before she left her special needs school we applied for employment support allowance as we would no longer be receiving child benefit. 'They told us she would have to have another screening process to rule out she is unfit for work - even though the doctor has sent a note to show how disabled she is. 'We filled this form out asking what Ellie could and couldn't do. It was a joke - just crosses in every box. Ellie can't read, write, talk or even sleep without help.' The teenager, who turns 20 next month, was born with part of a chromosome missing and has to be sedated each night due to the part of her brain which induces sleep being disabled. She also lives with one kidney - meaning she is prone to frequent infections - as well as bowel and bladder paralysis and 70 per cent curvature of her spine. Ellie, now 19, has an extremely rare genetic disorder which has left parts of her brain disabled . Miss McDonald applied for support for when Ellie leaves special school and was shocked to hear of the test . Miss McDonald, who lives with partner Ben, 38, and Ellie's younger sister Megan, seven, and ten-year-old brother Joshua, added: 'The system is too bureaucratic and it sees us as figures instead of people. 'Surely anyone can see Ellie will never be able to be independent, let alone work. I know they only want to check to avoid fraud, but if you look fraud only accounts for one per cent of disability allowances.' Speaking before the DWP decided not to make Ellie take the test, Miss McDonald said: 'It's a standard case of ""computer says no"" and it's made things really difficult. 'It's a waste of public money and a drain on the NHS - they know of Ellie's condition but will now have to conduct a series of degrading tests on her for the sake of proving what we all already know.' The family receives £310 every four weeks for disability living allowance and £141 every fortnight for employment support allowance. The family say Ellie will continue to go to her day care centre after she finishes at her special school. A DWP spokesman said earlier today: 'No-one should doubt our commitment to ensuring that people who need an assessment get the best possible service and are seen in the quickest possible time.' But following reports of Ellie's situation they released a new statement, saying Ellie would not have to take the test. A spokesman said: 'Miss McDonald is not required to do a Work Capability Assessment and she has been put in the support group of ESA. 'She has also been paid arrears of £244.98.' Miss McDonald says it should be clear to anyone that her daughter cannot work and has branded the demand she undergo the assessment 'bureaucracy gone mad'","Ellie McDonald cannot eat or walk alone due to a rare genetic disorder .

"Dame Helen Mirren is one of our classiest actresses, best known for her portrayal of The Queen, both on stage and screen. But when it comes to food, her tastes are rather less than regal. ‘My favourite dish in the world is fried egg and chips, cooked in a special way by a particular restaurant in Spain,’ she says. ‘I might struggle to cook it myself, though — my talents in the kitchen are strictly limited. My signature dish is baked beans on toast. Actually, I make even better cheese on toast. Or Marmite on toast, and marmalade on toast. I’m a dab hand with a toaster.’ Scroll down for video . Dame Helen Mirren is best known for playing The Queen, but when it comes to food her tastes are less regal . All of which means her latest role in The Hundred-Foot Journey, as the formidable Madame Mallory, owner of an upmarket, Michelin-starred restaurant in the South of France, is a bit of a stretch. ‘We do tally with our love of food — regardless of what it is or where it came from,’ Helen insists. That said, it’s hard to imagine the fictional Madame Mallory getting too excited about 69-year-old Helen’s ‘favourite dish in the world’. ‘It’s from a restaurant in Madrid that cooks the chips in suet, then breaks an egg over the top of them, that then cooks over the hot chips. Trust me, it is truly delicious.’ If this is an attempt to be seen as a woman of the people, rather than as Britain’s best-known movie actress, it’s not Helen’s only one. An Oscar-winner with The Queen eight years ago, she insists she is nothing more than a jobbing actress — happy to hitch from film to film rather than pose for the paparazzi on the red carpet and be feted wherever she goes. ‘I’m not a movie star, I’ve never thought of myself as that,’ she says. ‘Sure I won an Oscar but I got very, very lucky. And I wasn’t even a blip on the Americans’ radar until I was well into my 40s. ‘It’s very important to me that I’m not seen as a star, especially one readily associated with one role or one type of role. I fought very hard to wriggle free of my role as Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect because I didn’t want to be limited in the parts I was offered. ‘I’m always trying to escape from something, and I’m currently trying to see my way clear of my Queenliness. But it’s easier said than done when you’ve appeared as Her Majesty on film and in the West End.’ Especially as Helen won an Olivier for her stage performance as the Queen in The Audience last year, and will reprise the role on Broadway this autumn. ‘I suspect taking the part to New York may be the final nail in my coffin as far as trying to escape from Queenliness is concerned!’ she says. ‘I used to think that if I hadn’t been forgotten by the time I died, my obituary would read: “Actress who played TV cop Jane Tennison, and who used to take her clothes off, has died.” ‘Now, it would probably read: “Actress who played the Queen, and who used to take her clothes off, has died.” But that’s fine, as long as I still have the freedom to play a variety of other parts.’ Dame Helen has certainly varied the mix since her Oscar triumph. The roll-call includes two movies with Russell Brand — an adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Tempest and a remake of the comedy Arthur — the animated Monsters University, in which she voiced the frightening Dean Hardscrabble; TV film Phil Spector, when she was lawyer Linda Kenny Baden; spy movie The Debt, playing a former secret agent; and the big-screen thrillers Red, National Treasure: Book Of Secrets, and Red 2. The story follows Hassan Kadam (Manish Dayal) and his family who move from India to a village in the South of France where they open a restaurant and encounter Madame Mallory (played by Dame Helen Mirren, right) Dame Mirren describes The Hundred-Foot Journey as a 'charming story' and said it meant she could spend a couple of months in the South of France . Her latest film, The Hundred-Foot Journey, was very much a choice from the heart, as it meant she could spend a couple of months in the South of France and take part in what she calls a ‘charming story’. ‘It was also about getting a classic phone call when I was offered the film. I was told, “It’s Steven Spielberg on the line.” He is one of the producers, and I did think somebody was having me on, but it really was Steven, and I quickly said yes. ‘And, of course, there was the food. The Hundred-Foot Journey is a food movie, whether it’s the Michelin-starred dishes prepared by Madame Mallory’s establishment or the wonderful Indian fare in the restaurant 100ft across the road in the small town where the movie’s set.’ She adds: ‘When I appeared in The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, which also had a strong culinary element, the off-set catering for the cast and crew was terrible! I think they’d blown all the budget on the food you saw on screen, and everyone was reduced to eating Spam for lunch. ‘There was none of that on The Hundred-Foot Journey. The French caterers were excellent, and my co-star, Om Puri, who plays the Indian restaurant owner, used to bring in bowls of Indian food containing the most delicious snacks. It was culinary heaven.’ Dame Helen at the UK gala screening of The Hundred-Foot Journey in London this week . But wasn’t she worried about piling on weight? ‘Some actresses are always on diets and I am no different because you feel you have to be,’ Helen admits. ‘I suppose I’m fortunate in that I don’t put on huge amounts of weight — and the odd bout of illness where I’m off my food soon takes off the pounds. ‘I have about 10lb that seem to come and go from my body — I should give each one of them a name because they’ve become so familiar to me — and that’s been the way of things for as long as I can remember. Maybe I should do something about them — finally say goodbye to them. Giving up those two spoonfuls of sugar in my coffee might help! But food is surely something to be celebrated, something to be enjoyed.’ It’s certainly celebrated in The Hundred-Foot Journey, a comedy-drama that follows the intense rivalry between the two restaurants. Dame Helen says: ‘I seriously recommend that people don’t eat before they see it, so they salivate over all the gorgeous food — especially in the Indian restaurant — and then have the appetite for the most delicious meal later. ‘Isn’t it interesting how we Brits have taken to Indian food, how it’s become such a key part of what we eat? It’s the first meal my husband Taylor [Hackford, the American film director] and I have when we get back to London from abroad. ‘And the one food I really miss when I’m abroad is not fish and chips but a really good Indian meal.’ Helen will be able to sample the real deal for the first time when she travels to India in December to visit a literary festival. The trip dovetails with work on her next movie, Woman In Gold — about a Jewish refugee seeking justice for what happened to her family in World War II. As for next year, Helen has various projects under consideration. Not that the fear of unemployment ever leaves her, she admits. ‘I say to Taylor: “It will come to an end, you know, we all have finite careers.” ‘My aim is to carry on working, and enjoying that work, for as long as I possibly can. And if each project is as enjoyable to work on as The Hundred-Foot Journey, I shall be more than happy.’ PINK CHAMPAGNE SISTERS: The Live Sessions . THE vogue for vintage gathers pace with this sparkling debut by close harmony trio the Pink Champagne Sisters.

"Winds gusting up to 65 mph caused Lake Michigan waves to slam into the Chicago shoreline, sending water onto part of Lake Shore Drive. The waves which were up to 23-feet high slowed traffic and prompted the cancellation of a Halloween attraction. Parts of the scenic highway were flooded on Friday, leading to some lane closures and traffic was backed up for miles.

At one point cars were in a single-file line as waves crashed across the three lanes closest to the water. Emergency crews and trucks blocked the lanes to traffic while they worked to remove water off the road, city officials said. At one point, waves reached the southbound side, causing traffic in both directions to stop. It was a magnificent sight, and some people risked getting splashed just to see it. The high waves prompted Navy Pier, one of Chicago's top tourist attractions, to close its eastern end. The Ferris Wheel, Grand Ballroom and End Plaza were also closed because of the extreme weather.

Further west, mountain residents are excited about the first strong winter storm  that hit the Sierra Nevada overnight. Change of season: A wintry mix of colder temperatures, snow and strong winds seem to be heralding the arrival of winter . People in Truckee, a local ski resort, are hoping for a wet and snowy winter. The director of ski operations said the resort's 40 snow guns were primed for the weekend. 'We're excited -- (the) first real storm of the season is coming in,' Shaydar Edlemann said to KCRA. 'It looks like we might get a couple of real good nights of cold snow-making at the end of the weekend.' In the Sierra above 7,000 feet, 8 to 14 inches of early season snow was possible, with up to 6 inches falling around the Lake Tahoe's level. This photo shows snow in Lexington, South Carolina. Snow fell on states in the Upper Midwest and the South for the first time this season . Snow in Asheville, North Carolina: Areas of the South got in on the action over the weekend, with reports of snow falling in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and North Georgia . Snow was falling across the mountains of western North Carolina early Saturday, and higher elevations could see up to 10 inches of snow by Saturday evening . Several inches of snow was possible in some higher foothill locations. The storm is fairly typical for this time of year but decidedly welcome as the region struggles through three straight years of drought and looks to the coming winter to help turn things around. The storm should clear out Sunday, with temperatures in Reno Sunday night dropping below freezing. If people have yet to prepare sprinkler systems for winter, now is the time, Boyd said. Conditions should warm to average levels by Tuesday, with highs in the lower 60s expected in Reno. Snow also fell on states in the South for the first time this season. There were reports of snow falling in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and North Georgia. Up to 2.5 inches of snow coated grassy areas near Greenville, South Carolina, as well as Boone, North Carolina, early Saturday and two inches were reported in Asheville, North Carolina . For parts of the South, it's the earliest snow in 46 years. Up to six inches may fall in some places . The imminent arrival of winter is also given another visual reminder with the darker evenings beginning from Sunday night. At 2 a.m. Sunday, people will be turning back their clocks by an hour to mark the end of daylight savings time this year. As people return to standard time, police and safety officials are taking the opportunity to remind the public to change the batteries in their smoke detectors. Daylight savings time will return on the second Sunday in March 2015. Daylight saving time was put in place during the First World War to save energy in North America and Europe.","23-foot waves entirely cut off Chicago's Lakeshore Drive and at one point strong winds pushed the water ashore .

"The first facial recognition app for Google's Glass wearable computer has launched - and it claims to be able to spot your perfect date in a crowded room. It can scan the room, trying to match people with pictures takes from social networking and dating site. Its makers claim it can even check the sex offenders register before deciding on a match. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . The ultimate date finder: A new app for Google Glass can take a picture of a face then scour social networks for the person to see if they are a good match. Frame game: App designer Kevin Alan Tussy demonstrates how the software works . For peace of mind the NameTag app will cross-reference photographs against the sex offenders registry . NameTag can spot a face using the camera built into Google Glass. It then sends this via the wearer's mobile phone to a server and compare it to millions of records. In seconds, it will return a match complete with a name, additional photos and social media profiles. FacialNetwork.com, the developer of NameTag, is also currently creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as PlentyOfFish.com, OkCupid.com and Match.com. The technology will also allow users to scan photos against the more than 450,000 entries in the National Sex Offender Registry and other criminal databases. Called NameTag, it blurs the lines between online and offline dating by allowing smartphone users to simply glance at someone nearby, or take their photo, and instantly see that person's name, occupation and even visit their Facebook, Instagram or Twitter profiles in real-time. NameTag sends photographs wirelessly to a server, compare it to millions of records and in seconds return a match complete with a name, additional photos and social media profiles. FacialNetwork.com, the developer of NameTag, is also creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as PlentyOfFish.com, OkCupid.com and Match.com. For added peace of mind, the user can also cross-reference the photos against more than 450,000 entries in the National Sex Offender Registry and other criminal databases. Keeping it real: NameTag takes online dating offline . NameTag's creator Kevin Alan Tussy said: ‘I believe that this will make online dating and offline social interactions much safer and give us a far better understanding of the people around us. ‘It's much easier to meet interesting new people when we can simply look at someone, see their Facebook, review their LinkedIn page or maybe even see their dating site profile. Often we were interacting with people blindly or not interacting at all. NameTag can change all that.’ NameTag is currently available on Glass for Beta testers – meaning that the developer is letting people outside the company examine how it works to help iron out bugs and glitches. However, Google will not allow the app to be used for Glass beyond this as it contravenes its privacy rules - and NameTag has not made it clear how it will distribute the app. Following privacy concerns the firm included a line in its Glass Developer Policies banning any Glass app that uses 'the camera or microphone to cross-reference and immediately present personal information identifying anyone other than the user, including use cases such as facial recognition and voice print.' Tom Wiggins, Deputy Editor of tech mag Stuff, thinks the app is a good idea, but that users should exercise caution. He said: 'It could be very handy if you're not afraid of scaring people off with your creepy app. 'It's evidently pretty clever but I think most people would find it quite invasive. 'And isn't the point of dating to find out more about people? This kind of defeats the object. 'In terms of privacy, I assume it's only finding information that you've already put online, so it's not really any more of a risk to privacy than adding photos to Facebook.'","NameTag allows users to snap strangers and see their social media profiles .

"Wrong crowd: Nathen Channing, 27, face felony charges after pointing a banana at two deputies . A man is facing felony menacing charges after pointing a banana at two police officers. Nathen Channing, 27, of Fruitvale, Colorado, was arrested Sunday after two sheriff's deputies believed the yellow fruit aimed in their direction was a gun. Mesa County deputies Joshua Bunch and Donald Love said they 'feared for their lives' even though they saw that the object was yellow. Mr Channing was arrested on two counts of felony menacing. If convicted, he could face one to three years in prison and a fine of between $1,000 and $100,000. Deputy Bunch had been driving in Mesa County when he noticed Mr Channing on the sidewalk, an arrest affidavit states. He says he saw Mr Channing 'reach into the left side of his coat and pull out a yellow object, pointing it into the air then in my direction as I approached him,'Fox 31 Denver reports. Deputy Bunch sped off, believing Mr Channing to have drawn a weapon, and  radioed his fellow deputy, who was driving behind him, to warn him. Returning to the scene, Bunch says he saw Love approach Mr Channing as he pointed the same object at him. According to the arrest affidavit written by Deputy Bunch, Deputy Love 'observed what appeared to be a yellow tube with a black center'. 'Deputy Love stated he was in fear for his life at this point and was in the process of pulling out his handgun when Nathen yelled, ""It's a banana!"",' Bunch wrote. Deputy Bunch added that he also believed the banana to be a handgun 'based on training and experience'. The deputies say Channing told them he was doing a trial run for a planned YouTube video and he thought it would 'lighten the holiday spirit.'

"Many a woman on the online dating scene will have arranged a date with a man who claimed to be 6ft tall - only to find him somewhat shorter in reality. But according to new research the man was right to exaggerate his height - because the woman wouldn't have looked twice at his profile otherwise. New data from online dating website AYI.com has found size really does matter when it comes to a woman's search for Mr Right. The long and short of it: Women prefer taller men, as illustrated by petite 5ft 1in actress Hayden Panettiere who is engaged to 6ft 6in boxer Wladimir Klitschko . Researchers analysed more than 80,000 interactions between users of the dating website in the UK. They found that every inch increase in a man's height directly correlated to his likelihood of being contacted by a woman. Taller men were significantly more likely to be contacted by women than shorter men. Their data revealed that the ideal height women seek in a man is 6ft. The 6ft men who were members of the site were 33 per cent more likely to be contacted than a man of average height (5ft 7), and 77 per cent more likely to be contacted than a man under 5ft 4. But there is a limit to this height preference as women tend to shy away from men that are too tall. A man who is 6ft 4 or taller is 24 per cent less likely to be contacted by a woman. The statistics reveal how women will measure up a man based on his online profile before arranging to meet - and if they're too short they won't stand a chance. Height filter: Women using an online dating website are more likely to contact taller men, with 6ft being the ideal height of Mr Right . It might seem like a superficial aspect of online dating but it seems the same is also true in the real world. Earlier this year, British and Dutch researchers studied more than 12,000 couples in the UK to compile data specifically on their height differences. The study found that in 92.5 per cent of couples, the man was taller. Susan Krauss Whitbourne explains the appeal of taller men in Psychology Today. She writes: 'There's just something appealing about tall men. Napoleon aside, tall men are more likely to win the popular contest in presidential votes and to be re-elected once in office. Their greater leadership potential may have something to do with the fact that tall men have higher self-esteem (whether or not deserved), are happier, and less likely to feel jealous toward other men. 'When it comes to romantic partners, men and women tend to sort themselves out so that they form pairs of similar height. However, among married couples, women are more likely to be shorter than their husbands, if only by a few inches.' Perfect match: When Kate is not wearing heels, there's 7 inches in height between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - which is the ideal height difference many women want between them and their partner . When it comes to romance, she said tall men are more attractive because: 'Evolutionarily speaking, one might argue that a tall man would be preferred by women because, if you follow the argument, he'll be stronger and better able to ward off physical treats to his family.' She adds that while this is no longer relevant today when we're not looking for man to go out and hunt wild animals for us, women are now 'conditioned by media images' of the ideal man to seek taller men. The study by Dutch researchers found that women were most satisfied when they were much shorter than their male partners by about 7-8 inches.

"Loom bands may have been 2014’s bracelet of choice, but take a look around any office, gym, or High Street today and you’ll spot another kind of rubber bracelet. Unlike the purely decorative loom band, these sleek rubber bands — some with a watch-like face, some just a simple bracelet — have a function. Acting like mini personal trainers, these high-tech pedometers register calories burned, steps taken, distance travelled and even how well you’ve slept, handily logging all of the data on to an app on your smartphone. Scroll down for video . Anna Magee (pictured) tested out six of the most popular high-tech pedometers that register calories burned, steps taken, distance travelled and even how well you’ve slept . They’ve been a huge hit with fitness freaks and desperate dieters alike, and look set to become even more prevalent as both Apple and Google launch their versions this year. By 2018, it’s estimated that 130 million fitness trackers will have been sold worldwide — and they’re particularly popular in the UK, with more Britons wearing one than in any other country in Europe. But sales figures aren’t the only things on the up. A growing body of rather worrying research suggests that, when it comes to counting calories, some of these high-tech, high-priced gadgets — which start at around £80 and can cost several hundreds of pounds — could, in fact, be completely wide of the mark. Anna (pictured) was put through different exercises to see if the fitness trackers she were accurate . Just last week, a study by Iowa State University in the U.S., revealed some of the bands could overestimate wearers’ calorie burn by as much as 40 per cent — a huge margin of error when you’re trying to work out how many calories you should be consuming. Could this be why a raft of dieters on weight-loss forums across the web are joining discussions entitled such things as ‘My Fitbit [one of the most popular brands] is making me fat!’ with tales of gaining, rather than losing, pounds? As someone who has become a devotee of the gadgets over the past six months, I didn’t want to believe the stories. Anna completed the tests at Bath University with Dr Oliver Peakcock who measured her breath to get acute results . As the editor of the women’s health website healthista.com, I get sent new health products to test every day. After a stint trialling the Nike+ FuelBand (£89, nike.com) — dubbed the A-list fitness accessory by Vogue, no less — I had become obsessive about tracking my calories and steps, and competing with myself to increase my daily activity. But despite my slavish devotion to the technology, even I had begun to have my doubts. After a trialling the Nike+ FuelBand, Anna (pictured) become obsessive about tracking calories and steps, and competing with herself to increase her daily activity . Recently, I was sent another new tracker — the Misfit Shine (£79.95, johnlewis.com). One day, I wore both the Misfit Shine and the Nike+ FuelBand while doing my regular 30-minute morning workout and 25-minute walk to work. But when I arrived at work, I noticed the Misfit Shine said that I’d burned 250 calories more than the FuelBand said I had. I was stunned. Which to believe? I asked the manufacturers of both if they could send me studies conducted by the companies proving the accuracy of their trackers. Neither supplied them. Which is when I discovered that, actually, there isn’t much evidence out there at all. Anna appealed to the companies that produce the fitness trackers to ask if they could provide her with studies conducted by the companies proving the accuracy of their trackers, but they didn't and she discovered there isn't much evidence available to prove the accuracy of the bands . ‘There’s little published data from manufacturers on the validity of these fitness monitors,’ says Gregory Welk, professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University, who has conducted trials on fitness monitors, which also showed wide inaccuracies between their readings. Reluctant to give up my fitness tracker addiction, I decided to put them to the test myself, pitting my Nike+ FuelBand and Misfit Shine against the other most popular models on the market — the Jawbone UP (£99.99, jawbone.com/up), the Fitbit Flex (£79.99, fitbit.com/uk/flex), the Garmin Vivofit (£99.99, buy.garmin.com) and the Ki Fit (£268.99, kiperformance.co.uk). I began by wearing all six bands at once for a day to see how much of a difference they would show in calories burned — the main thing most of us are worried about when it comes to tracking activity. Initally Anna wore all six bands to see the figures they came up with for the same activities, she found the calorie counters varied widely between all six of them . After my morning workout, my walk to and from work (25 minutes each way) and spending the rest of the day typing at my desk, the results ranged from 1,591 calories burned (the Jawbone UP) to a staggering 2,196 (the Misfit Shine). That’s a difference of 605 calories that I might, or might not, be burning — or more than 4,000 calories a week, around the same number you need to cut out to lose an entire pound of fat! It was a huge and alarming discrepancy, I had to admit. So, why was it happening? Anna visited the lab of Dylan Thompson, professor of sport, health and exercise science at the University of Bath, where she was measured by his Indirect Calorimetry (IC) machine . Jon Denoris, a fitness trainer and author of The Pop-up Gym, has tested countless fitness trackers, and explains that most of them use something called an accelerometer — essentially a motion sensor — which registers your movements and feeds them into the device. Using this information, your personal calorie expenditure is then calculated using the average burn of other people of your weight and height, making it a lot less scientific than you might think. Some are clearly more sophisticated than others. In order to work out which was the most accurate, I visited the lab of Dylan Thompson, professor of sport, health and exercise science at the University of Bath, to be measured by his Indirect Calorimetry (IC) machine. The results that came back from the experiment showed some areas where there were massive differences between the readings given by the different fitness bands . This involves wearing a mask that analyses the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your breath — the universally recognised gold standard technique for calculating calorie burn. Wearing the IC mask and each of my six bands, I carried out four different activities, with different levels of intensity and ranges of movement, for eight minutes each — walking on a treadmill; cycling on a stationary bike; sitting at a computer, typing; and packing groceries — to see how they stacked up. All the numbers represent calories burned in the eight minutes. Here are the surprising results . . . As you can see from the table, the results were not exactly impressive. For each of the activities, I ranked the trackers according to how accurate they were. The Garmin Vivofit came first or second in all our tests, with the exception of cycling — where it wildly underestimated the number of calories I’d expended. Although I’d always far prefer that something underestimated than overestimated calories burned, lulling you into a false sense of security and giving you licence to over-eat. In fact, the Garmin only thought I’d burned more calories than I actually had during one test, the typing test — if I was typing, as I often do, for eight hours, I would think I’d burned 960 calories when I’d only really have burned 600. ‘Every device will have some room for error,’ says Professor Thompson, although he points out that our trial wasn’t as controlled as a proper research experiment. That said, I wouldn’t invest in the Misfit Shine, which overestimated my calorie burn in almost every task — by more than 700 per cent in one case. This experiment has made me question my devotion to fitness trackers. I’m not the only one. Recent research found that although sales are on the up, like gym memberships, they’re soon ditched, with a third of people abandoning theirs after only six months. I’m going back to that simple equation of moving more and eating less. It’s low-tech — but at least I know it works.","Anna Magee has tested out the newest trend seen on joggers and gym-goers across the country .

"The American Ebola victims have said they would not hesitate to treat patients with the virus again. Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, Amber Vinson, Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning for their first ever joint interview. They were not joined by Dr Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who was diagnosed with the virus after returning to New York City from Guinea. He was released earlier this month. Most of the group had been working with Ebola victims in West Africa or in the U.S. when they contracted Ebola, but when asked if they would do the same again, it was unanimous 'yes'. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Ebola survivors (from left) Amber Vinson, Dr. Kent Brantly, Nina Pham, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra and Ashoka Mukpo appeared on the Today show on Tuesday for their first ever joint interview . 'Nursing is a calling and it's such a rewarding career,' said Nina Pham, who contracted the virus while treating a patient in Dallas, Texas. 'It's in our personalities and our nature to help.' Ashoka Mukpo, an NBC News video journalist who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, quipped: 'I wish I had used a little bit more chlorine.' Writebol, who contracted the virus in July while on a missionary trip to Liberia, added that she would even 'possibly' return to carry out further aid work. Dr Sacra, a married dad-of-three who also contracted the virus in Liberia, agreed he would return. A few of the former patients - Dr. Rick Sacra,  Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo - had fought the virus after getting plasma donations from Dr. Brantly. For more video, please go to Today . No regrets: The survivors told Matt Lauer, left, that they would treat Ebola victims again in the future . Brantly, 33, and Writebol, 59, were both in Liberia when they contracted Ebola and were flown back to Emory Hospital in Atlanta, where they both recovered and were released. Brantly's blood was then used to cure other patients. 'I just want to say thank you,' Mukpo said to Brantly on Today. 'It's a good opportunity to express my appreciation for what you did. It's just amazing that you gave so much to all of us.' Pham added: 'He's a selfless man and he's like our angel. He gave us a second chance at life.' But Brantly responded with characteristic modesty, saying: 'I think God saved my life and I have a responsibility to use my life in a way that is glorifying to Him and helpful to other people. Together: Amber Vinson, a nurse who contracted Ebola in Texas, shared new photos of her with her fiance . Happy: Vinson and her fiance, Derrick Markray, smile as they show off her new engagement ring, which she was given for free by a Dallas jewelers; her first ring was destroyed after her diagnosis . 'It was an honor and a privilege but also just a natural thing to help others.' His blood had not proved a match with that of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to be diagnosed with Ebola and who later died. Pham and Vinson contracted Ebola while treating him. Another high-profile survivor was Pham's dog Bentley, a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel, who was put in quarantine after concerns he might have contracted Ebola. But he showed no traces of the virus and has now been reunited with Pham, 26. 'He gets more questions than people ask about me,' she said, laughing. 'He just celebrated his second birthday.' She and the other survivors said that while some people had been extremely supportive following their diagnoses, they had also been bombarded with abuse from others, who deemed them careless. Reunited: Nina Pham's dog Bentley, who was put into quarantine, has just celebrated his second birthday . Back together: Dr Kent Brantly, 33, has also been reunited with his wife Amber and their two young children . 'There's been a lot of scrutiny,' Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, said. 'We've all been under a magnifying glass or under a microscope for the past couple of months. There's a lot of criticism on social media that you see.' Recovered: They were not joined by Dr Craig Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola in NYC . They agreed that they believe some people will always keep their distance from them - with Mukpo quipping that he believes they'll get pretty good seats on future plane journeys. Another former patient to receive criticism was Vinson, who contracted the virus while working in Dallas and then - unaware she had it - flew to Ohio to plan her wedding before returning to Texas. The 29-year-old has previously said she would never have boarded the planes if she felt ill. Now she is looking forward to marrying her fiance, and shared photographs with the Today show of them together in front of their Christmas tree. 'It gave me hope [that other people had survived],' she said. 'I knew that it was a struggle but.. [medical staff] told me there would be rough days but there are others who have made it through.' At the conclusion of the interview, the group expressed their thanks to family, friends and strangers who have offered their support over the past few months. Mukpo added: 'I'm thankful for all the brave men and women in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone who put their lives at risk to deal with this epidemic. They're the real heroes.'","Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, Amber Vinson, Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning .

"A smart frying pan that helps you cook by telling you what to do and when has been released. Called Pantelligent the smart device uses a heat sensor to give you specific instructions on how to prepare food. It syncs up with your smartphone or smartwatch to give you alerts and reminders as to when you need to perform a task. Scroll down for video . A team of former MIT engineers in California has created Pantelligent. The smart frying pan (shown) syncs up with phones to make cooking easier. It has a temperature sensor and wireless connectivity to send instructions and reminders to your smartphone or smartwatch . The team behind the project, four former Massachussets Institute of Tehcnology (MIT) engineers from California, is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter. ‘Now anyone can cook delicious meals perfectly,’ they write. ‘The secret ingredient is temperature control.’ First, you’ll need to open the app and choose what you want to cook. It will then give you steps to follow to get in the ingredients prepared. The app will tell you how hot the pan is, and how hot it should be for the meal you have selected. A graph with a red line (actual temperature) and target temperature (green line) helps you keep it at the right level. Technology in the handle connects to your smartphone, and it will send you a reminder when you either need to do something with the food, or when it is done. It operates just like a regular pan on a hob but has some technology hidden safely inside. In the middle of the frying pan is a temperature sensor that communicates with an iOS app. This gives you constant reminders as your food cooks, telling you what to do and when to do it. Most of the methodology revolves around time and temperature; by knowing the temperature of the pan, the technology knows how long food needs to cook for. Before you start cooking it asks for specifics about the food you intend to cook - such as the thickness of salmon - so it knows exactly how long to cook it for. This helps it keep track of the temperature and time required. And it will tell you when to flip or move your food so that it cooks evenly. Using an app for your phone it will display a graph showing you the temperature of the pan. And when it is time for you to do something, or the food has finished cooking, it will send you a notification. The pan is non-stick while the handle, containing the technology that syncs with your chosen device, is made of commercial-grade thermoset plastic resin, the same material used for high-quality frying pan handles. ‘Pantelligent helps you cook anything you can cook with a regular frying pan, only smarter, and perfect every time,’ the team adds. There are dozens of recipes available in the app at the moment but there are apparently more on the way. The £159 ($249) device is due to begin shipping in August next year.

"Mother of three Allison Baden-Clay was engaged to a strapping scuba diving instructor before she was pursued by Gerard Baden-Clay, the real estate agent she would eventually marry and who would later strangle her and dump her body in a creek near their family home. The new revelations about the murder that gripped Brisbane society are in a new book called The Murder of Allison Baden-Clay by The Courier Mail's crime and courts editor David Murray. Baden-Clay, who had a string of affairs throughout his marriage and who was jailed for life in July, two years after his wife's murder, wooed Allison. They eventually married and had three daughters.

She told told Bulgarian TV that she gave birth to a girl while working in Greece 'several years ago' but that she had to leave the child because she didn't have enough money to take her home. She has had eight children. 'I intended to go back and take my child home, but meanwhile I gave birth to two more kids so I was not able to go back' she said, insisting that she did not get paid for giving up the girl. Maria's discovery at a Roma camp has given hope to parents with abducted children, including Gerry and Kate McCann. But documents suggest Mrs Ruseva may have given the girl away after she lied on birth documents, meaning her daughter was never officially recorded. Paperwork from Lamia show that Mrs Ruseva gave birth to a girl on January 31, 2009. That is the same date given as Maria's birthday by the Roma couple who the youngster was living with. Charged: Hristos Salis (right) and  his wife, . Eleftheria Dimopoulou (left), said they were given Maria, centre, by an impoverished Bulgarian woman who handed over the child, saying that she could not afford to support her . Charges: Hristos Salis, 39,  left, and . Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, right, appeared at a courthouse in . Larissa to answer charges of abducting a minor and holding false papers. They are pictured here last Thursday . Mrs Ruseva tried to register her daughter 10 days after she gave birth. In a document submitted to authorities, she claimed that she was unmarried and did not know who the father of the child was. Police in Ireland have been accused of racism after DNA tests proved that two blond children taken from their Roma gypsy parents were rightfully theirs. Detectives were responding to public tip offs fueled by media coverage of the alleged child abduction case involving blonde-haired girl Maria and a family of Roma in Greece. In both cases, police suspected that the children, a seven-year-old girl from Dublin and two-year-old Iancu Munteau from Athlone, might be victims of abduction because they were blond haired and blue eyed unlike the rest of their immediate family. Garda commissioner Martin Callinan has now been ordered to produce a report explaining why the two children were taken from their families. Ireland's Ombudsman for Children is also to investigate the issue. But an identity check at the time showed that Mrs Ruseva was married and had two children to another husband. A note was put on her application which read: 'Warning – she is married'. 'NB: she is married although at the . hospital stated she was unmarried but she gave her married name – we are . awaiting judicial decision.' There is no record of that decision being . reached, however. Greek police are now working with Bulgarian colleagues to determine if Mrs Ruseva's case is connected to Maria. Neighbours of the Bulgarian woman said she has at least four children who are 'very blonde' like Maria. The revelation tallies with the story told by the Roma couple Christos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, who were found to be caring for Maria. They have been charged with child abduction after a raid on the Farsala settlement last week but deny the allegations. The pair claim that Maria was handed to them when she was just weeks old by a poor Bulgarian woman who said that she could not afford to support the child.","Greek police trace possible biological mother in Bulgaria .

"Police have asked villagers armed with a speed gun to stop clocking drivers breaking the law - because they can't cope with the paperwork. Residents in Ticknall, Derbyshire, were given the gun by officers to catch speeding motorists who break the 30mph limit through their village. So far the volunteers have carried out 10 speeding operations on the A514 main road through the village clocking a total of around 200 motorists. Residents in Ticknall, Derbyshire, have been given a speed gun by officers to catch speeding motorists who break the 30mph limit through their village . But now police have told the group its operations are netting so many motorists they can't cope - so they'll have to stop clocking speeding drivers. They have announced a new crackdown in the area as part of a new road safety scheme  - and told them they can stand down. Drivers caught by the speed gun are sent warning letters from force saying they have breached the limit and if they do it again they risk prosecution. They are allowed 6mph leeway over the limit. So far the volunteers have carried out 10 speeding operations on the A514 main road through the village clocking a total of around 200 motorists . Volunteer Kevin Harris said: 'We are getting so many cars speeding that the police said they couldn't cope. 'But we will keep doing the speed watches because if we don't do something someone will be killed. 'The police are doing what they can with the resources they have.' Police say the new crackdown by the Derbyshire Road Safety Partnership will tackle speeding on problem roads in the county. A Derbyshire Police spokesman said: 'Community speedwatch events are an extremely valuable resource of information for us, as they help to illustrate the volume of speeding in certain areas. 'This allows us to focus our efforts on areas that we know are a problem or could become one. But now police have told the group its operations are netting so many motorists they can't cope - so they'll have to stop clocking speeding drivers. Instead, they have announced a new crackdown in the area as part of a new road safety scheme - and told them they can stand down . The A514 through Ticknall has been identified as one of 100 roads across the county that we will be focusing on over the coming year, and that is partly down to the work of local residents carrying out the speed watches. 'However, the watches do result in increased workload for police staff, as every driver seen speeding receives a letter and this has to be processed. 'That is why we ask residents to be reasonable with the frequency and length of time spent recording details.'","Residents in Ticknall, Derbyshire, were given a speed gun by police .

"The world's cruellest zoo has claimed another victim after an African lion was found hanging in its cage, it emerged today. The Surabaya Zoo in Indonesia, which has outraged MailOnline readers around the world after an expose on the treatment of its animals, is being investigated by police following the death of the 18-month-old lion called Michael. But the lion's body was removed before police were able to examine it and cannot now be found. A senior officer declined to say whether it was believed the zoo was trying to hamper the investigation. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Michael the lion is found hanging in his cage after apparently getting his head stuck between steel cables at Surabaya Zoo in Indonesia which has been heavily criticised for its treatment of its animals . Michael was found strangled in his cage after his head became stuck between steel cables, the Jakarta Globe reported today. The tragedy comes just 24 hours after it was learned that a wildebeest died in its enclosure from a stomach problem, although the zoo said that the wet weather was partly to blame. The death of Michael the lion is certain to cause further demands from animal lovers around the world for urgent action to be carried out at the zoo. Closing it down, however, is not an option because no other zoo has expressed an interest in taking the animals. Latest statistics, covering the months between July and September last year, reveal that 43 animals died at the zoo during that period. Horrific: Chained by three legs, this juvenile male elephant was one of several animals which featured in a recent expose for MailOnline last month that has outraged readers around the world . Emaciated: This camel's ribs were plain to see as it ate grass in its enclosure when reporter Richard Shears visited the zoo last month . Among those which have died there previously is a giraffe that was found to have 20 kilograms of plastic in its stomach and a Sumatran tiger found to have a rotten digestive tract after being regularly fed meat laced with formaldehyde. In the wake of Michael the lion's death, zoo spokesman Agus Supangkat denied that his death was caused by zookeepers' negligence. 'We are still investigating how the steel cables could entrap the African lion's head,' he told the Globe. 'Michael was relatively young. He was only one and a half years old. It could be that he was playing around and somehow his head got stuck.' Sad: A South American brown capuchin monkey looked imploringly out of its cage for several minutes before grabbing a banana and returning to the cage's edge . Cramped: This Sumatran tiger groaned as it sat in a brick hutch. One tiger last year died after its digestive tract was rotted by the formaldehyde-laced meat it ate . Mr Agus said each of the zoo's lions - there are now only four left - spends its days in two different cages. Each morning, the lions are taken to a display cage where visitors can view them. Then, in the afternoon they are moved to another cage where they sleep, said Mr Agus. He explained that the zoo used steel cables to secure the cage so zookeepers did not have to manually open or close the cage door with their hands. This, he said, was a safety precaution to prevent the keepers being injured. Michael was sent to the zoo last March by the East Java Natural Resources Conservation Agency. Dwindling numbers: A zoo spokesman said each of the lions - there are now only four left - spends its days in two different cages, one for displaying to visitors, the other for sleeping . Exposed: A MailOnline probe before Christmas found several cases of animals in miserable conditions . Surabaya Police detectives chief Senior Commander Farman told the Globe that a team of officers had visited the zoo to gather evidence but the corpse was missing. He said that if the lion's body could be found 'we are going to wait for the autopsy results, then we can further examine the case.' A MailOnline investigation into the zoo before Christmas found numerous cases of animals living in miserable conditions, including a young elephant that was chained by three legs, one of which was ulcerated because of its tight shackles. Dozens of petitions were started pleading for the zoo to be closed and animal rights groups have added their voice to the demands. But a management team, headed by the Surabaya Mayor, Mrs Tri Rismaharini, has resisted improvements saying they want to retain the original structures erected by Dutch colonialists in 1916.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Brought up as an Orthodox Christian by her mother, Aminat Kurbanova looked a picture of happiness at her wedding nine years ago - marrying the man with whom she had fallen in love at drama school. But she converted to Islam in 2007 and three months ago walked into the house of a Muslim cleric in Dagestan, Russia, wearing a 3lb bomb, and blew herself up - killing eight people including her. Once a stage actress, the 29-year-old mother had transformed into a Muslim suicide bomber. The blast shocked Russia but her mother Vera Saprighina insists she was ‘a kind person, not a monster’. Happy: Aminat Kurbanova, 29, of Dagestan, Russia, is seen smiling on her wedding day in 2003 to Marat Kurbanov. She converted to Islam four years later and blew herself up earlier this year . Kurbanova was brought up in Makhachkala, Dagestan, and gained top marks at the city’s arts and drama college - where she met her future husband Marat Kurbanov, reported the Sunday Times. The couple married in 2003 and she gave birth to a daughter, Malika, two years later. In 2006 the couple were introduced to Islam by Marat’s brother Rustam - and Kurbanov converted a year later. ‘She said she had finally found the right religion for her,’ her mother Vera Saprighina told the Sunday Times. ‘Before long, both left the theatre because dancing and acting are considered un-Islamic.’ But Rustam was killed in a police house raid on suspected militants in 2008. It shocked the couple. Marat left home, never to come back, and is thought to have joined militants to avenge the death. Conversion: The 29-year-old woman transformed herself from an actress into a Muslim suicide bomber . Location: At least 12 religious leaders have been killed over the last two years in Dagestan - allegedly by militants angry that they are too friendly with the authorities . However 12 months later, Marat also died when police opened fire on a car that did not stop at a checkpoint - and Kurbanova ‘often said she wished she had died with him’, Ms Saprighina stated. Mugshot: A photo of Amanat Kurbanova issued by the Dagestan branch of Russia's Interior Ministry . Then Marat’s other brother Ali, a sportsman living in Moscow, vanished on holiday in Dagestan after being allegedly killed by police. Therefore by this stage, both of Marat’s brothers were dead - along with him. Kurbanova started to earn money as an Islamic dress seamstress and became more religious. She began to be watched by security services, who allegedly searched her flat and questioned her after the death of her husband. She later married the best man at her wedding, Timur Kurbamagomedov, but this was short-lived - and she left a note for her mother in March saying she was worried about being tortured. Kurbanova walked into the home of Sheikh Said Atsayev, 74, after kissing her daughter goodbye and blew herself up with a steel-bolt bomb, killing seven others - including the cleric himself and a 12-year-old boy who was there with his father. Her relatives tried to keep the news from Malika, but she overheard at school that ‘your mum’s a suicide bomber’ and saw her mother's severed head on TV, reported the Sunday Times. At least 12 religious leaders have been killed over the last two years in Dagestan - allegedly by militants angry that they are too friendly with the authorities. Atsayev could have been targeted because he spoke against violent Islam. Kurbanova’s family said Malika often asks questions about her late parents and wants to know ‘when she will join them up there in the sky’.","Aminat Kurbanova, 29, of Dagestan, seen smiling on wedding day in 2003 .

"More than 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for Tony Blair to be stripped of a controversial charity award for his 'legacy' in Africa. Save the Children has been hit by a furious backlash over the prize - amid claims it is 'a betrayal' of the charity's principles. It comes after the row   reached the Commons today when an MP questioned how Mr Blair could be awarded a prize after taking Britain to war 'unnecessarily' in Iraq. The intervention, during Prime Minister's Questions, sparked David Cameron to mock the prize - pointing out it had been awarded by a former member of Gordon Brown's staff. Scroll down for video . Former prime minister Tony Blair was given the Global Legacy award by Save The Children at a star-studded event in New York last week. In the Commons today, David Cameron mocked the decision to give the former Prime Minister a prize . Mr Blair was given Save The Children's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership on international development at a star-studded ceremony in New York last week . Lassie the dog was among the stars on the red carpet, along with Ben Affleck, who also won an award, his wife Jennifer Garner and Twilight starlet Dakota Fanning. But it has attracted criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for rewarding Mr Blair, who is a divisive figure on the world stage after taking Britain to war in Iraq in 2003. An online petition set up less than three days ago has already attracted more than 100,000 signatures demanding that the award is rescinded. In the Commons today, Tory MP Andrew Turner – who represents the Isle of Wight - condemned Save the Children's award. He asked Mr Cameron: 'Does the Prime Minister's believe that Tony Blair should get a global legacy award from Save The Children for taking us to war unnecessarily in Iraq?' Mr Cameron refused to get involved but can't resist a swipe at the old Labour battles. He said: 'The remarkable thing about this award is that Tony Blair got it from someone who used to work for Gordon Brown. 'Obviously the person who gave the award knows about peace-making and peace-keeping.' Save the Children's UK chief executive is Justin Forsyth, who worked as an adviser for Mr Blair for three years and then for Mr Brown. However, the award was given by the US arm of Save the Children. Meanwhile a petition calling for a charity to take back an award presented to former prime minister Tony Blair for his work to address poverty in Africa has gained more than 90,000 signatures. Comedian Dom Joly tweeted that he was 'pretty embarrassed' to be an ambassador for Save The Children 'when they hand out awards to Tony Blair for his 'anti-poverty' work'. He added: 'I can only assume they meant his own, personal poverty?' Comedian Dom Joly said he was 'pretty embarrassed' to be an ambassador for Save The Children after it gave the award to Mr Blair . Last night it emerged 200 workers at the charity staff have signed a petition saying the award 'endangers our credibility' and calling for it to be withdrawn. The letter demands a review of the charity's decision-making process which led to the award being given to Mr Blair. Extracts of the letter published by The Guardian stated: 'We consider this award inappropriate and a betrayal to Save the Children's founding principles and values. 'Management staff in the region were not communicated with nor consulted about the award and were caught by surprise with this decision.' But in a statement, Mr Blair's office claimed the article 'sought to traduce the reputation of Save the Children, and was neither balanced nor fair'. The statement added that the Guardian 'conveniently disregards the facts that support the award as well as quotes from African Presidents, the head of USAID and indeed anything which would give a more balanced view than the one presented'. It added: 'The award was in recognition of Tony Blair's work in leading G8 nations at Gleneagles in 2005 to pledge to double aid to Africa and provide 100 per cent debt relief to eligible countries, as well as his ongoing work in partnership with African governments through his Foundation, the Africa Governance Initiative. 'The AGI is helping some of the world's poorest people and is today working in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Guinea, Nigeria and Ethiopia.' Looking sharp: Mr Blair (left) rubbed shoulders with Hollywood royalty including Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner (right) as guest of honour at the star-studded event . Hero dog: Lassie, or rather her latest incarnation, was also among the guests at the sumptuous gala event . Star-studded bash: (From left) Mr Blair, Mike Bezos of the Bezos Family Foundation, actress Dakota Fanning, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nicholas Kristof at the event in New York . Two former aides of Tony Blair have significant roles in Save the Children. Poverty adviser to Blair: Justin Forsyth . Justin Forsyth, who worked in Downing Street from 2004 to 2010, is chief executive of Save the Children UK. And 12 months ago, Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff throughout his time in power, was appointed to the board of Save the Children International. Mr Forsyth was recruited by Mr Blair to work in Downing Street as an adviser on poverty and climate change. He worked on the Government's aid agenda, including the Make Poverty History campaign. Mr Forsyth worked for Oxfam before entering No 10, and stayed on after Mr Blair left as Gordon Brown's director of strategic communications and campaigns. Jonathan Powell, former chief of staff . He was appointed as Save the Children UK's chief executive soon after the General Election in September 2010. Mr Forsyth attracted controversy two years ago when Save the Children UK warned some parents in the UK could not afford hot meals and shoes for their children. The Tories accused him of turning the charity into a political organisation. His pay packet was also criticised last year when it emerged he was paid £163,000 a year. It has since fallen to £140,000. As Mr Blair's chief of staff, Mr Powell was among his most senior advisers, and played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. The award has renewed the focus on links between senior figures in the charity and Mr Blair. Jonathan Powell, who was Mr Blair's chief of staff, is on the board of directors of Save the Children International. One of the charity's senior managers sent an email last week commenting on the backlash, and admitting the charity had received a 'high volume of complaints and negative reactions' regarding the award. Global media manager Krista Armstrong accepted that Mr Blair was a 'hugely controversial and divisive figure in many parts of the world'. She also listed questions received by outraged staff members asking why Save the Children would hand out one of its most prestigious awards 'to a man accused of being a war criminal'. Mr Blair was presented with the award last Wednesday at an 'Illumination Gala' at the Plaza Hotel in New York. He was praised for his 'leadership on international development' and the charity pointed to two major summits on debt relief for poor countries during his premiership. Accepting the award, Mr Blair said: 'From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. 'But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.' Mr Blair set Britain on course to meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. But critics of the ballooning aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – say the target is arbitrary, warn huge increases in spending will lead to waste, and point out that money is going to India, a country with its own space programme. Much of the opposition to Mr Blair centres on his decision to take Britain to war in Iraq. But his consultancy work for the autocratic President of Kazakhstan has led to opposition leaders in the former Soviet state saying he has 'blood on his hands'. Mr Blair is said to have earned millions of pounds advising Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1989, on how to 'spin' a massacre of civilians by his regime. Last night a Save the Children spokesman said: 'Contrary to some reports, the award was not awarded by Save the Children UK or Justin Forsyth, its UK CEO. It was given to Tony Blair last week by Save the Children US at their gala event in New York. 'He received the award because of his work on Africa and poverty when Prime Minister. He led the G8 nations at Gleneagles to agree a doubling of aid to Africa, debt cancellation and universal access to Aids treatment. 'In a global organisation like ours of thousands of people, our staff have strong views on a whole range of issues and people and we respect that diversity of views.' In a lengthy criticism of The Guardian posted on the website of The Office of Tony Blair last night, a spokesman said: 'The award was in recognition of Tony Blair's work in leading G8 nations at Gleneagles in 2005 to pledge to double aid to Africa and provide 100 per cent debt relief to eligible countries, as well as his ongoing work in partnership with African governments through his Foundation, the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI). 'It is extraordinary that while ignoring the body of work undertaken by Tony Blair, the AGI and the people they work alongside in African governments . . . the article also sought to traduce the reputation of Save the Children, and was neither balanced nor fair.'","Online petition on 38 Degrees website was only set up three days ago .

"An icebound convoy in Alaska is in nearly the same position it was a day ago, despite efforts to extricate it from the ice so it can deliver fuel to the capital, nearly 100 miles away. Because of strong currents from the Bering Sea and thick ice, the vessels moved through 56 miles of the sea Tuesday, but made minimal progress Tuesday, only advancing 50 feet. Its progress is being aided by a 2.5-pound drone, which flies overhead and sends information to scientists on shore. When the Russian tanker Renda – which is carrying 1.3million gallons of fuel for Nome – arrives at its destination, it will still have to face a 25-foot pressure ridge that is blocking the entrance to the harbour. Partners in ice: The Russian vessel moved only 53 feet Tuesday after advancing 50 miles the day before . Tricky maneuvering: Shifting ice, described as dynamic ice, has slowed the progress of the paired vessels, which moved forward 53 feet, but then back 50 . World of white: The US Coast Guard the cutter Healy, left, breaks ice around the Russian tanker Renda . The camera-equipped drone looks like a smoke detector with wings and legs. It glides on 20-minute missions ranging from 10 feet to 320 feet above the ice, and its images can be instantly viewed on a tablet-type computer screen. It has sent back images that are being analysed at the University of Anchorage, where researchers hope to guide the ships on the most successful route. Once the ships make it to Nome, the other obstacle awaiting them is a 25-foot ice ridge. Though it extends well down into the ocean, geophysicists say the ice won’t prevent the 370-foot tanker from delivering the much-needed fuel, though it won’t be able to dock. The tanker is equipped with a hose more than a mile long for offloading and the icebreaker is creating a path for the tanker in ice that is up to three feet thick. If successful, the shipment would mark the first time petroleum products have been delivered by sea to a Western Alaska community in winter. Jason Evans, chairman of Sitnasuak Native Corporation, the company arranging the delivery, said the mission remains challenging. 'I think there continues to be a lot of pressure on the ice, so when they break the ice it wants to immediately squeeze together, or the broken ice wants to shoot back into the hole they just made,' he said Tuesday. Slow and unsteady: During the winter months, the ice is around three feet thick. The ships must also fight the strong currents of the Bering Sea . Careful monitoring: Bill Walker, with the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, gathers aerial photos and video of daily ice conditions in preparation for the planned fuel transfer from the Russian tanker . Shifting ice, described as dynamic ice, has slowed the progress of the paired vessels. The ice tends to close in, cutting off the path between the two ships. When that happens, the icebreaker doubles back and makes a relief cut to take pressure off the tanker and open a pathway. 'I think they continue to do well with the circumstances,' Mr Evans said. He said the tanker and the icebreaker were expected to go through a large section of thinner ice and then encounter thicker ice again near Nome. Without the gasoline delivery, Nome could run short of fuel before a barge delivery becomes possible in late spring. Clearing the way: The Russian tanker Renda moves slowly through the cracked sea ice in a path made by the Coast Guard icebreaker the Healy . Slow going: The Coast Guard icebreaker Healy leads the way for the Russian tanker the Renda . Stuck: Ice flows about a foot thick have trapped the Renda, forcing the Healy to turn around the free the tanker before they can move forward . A massive storm prevented the town of 3,500 on the northwestern coast of Alaska from receiving its last delivery of supplies before it was socked in by the unspeakable winter cold. The town could run out of the fuel it needs to heat and power homes, vehicles, hospitals and schools. If the mission is successful, it will be the first time petroleum products have been delivered by sea to a Western Alaska community in winter. The Coast Guard said the Russian tanker came upon ice about a foot thick very early Friday near Nunivak Island, a large island in the eastern Bering Sea. Last chance: The tanker is carrying 1.3 million gallons of fuel that could not make it to Nome before winter because of a massive storm . Much needed supplies: If the tanker doesn't reach Nome this winter, the village might run out of supplies . Surrounded: The Renda, which is a 350-foot tanker, can steam through sea ice on its own, as long as it's not too thick . The Coast Guard icebreaker should have no problem getting through the ice even if it becomes several feet thick, said Coast Guard Petty Officer First Class David Mosley. 'In the worst-case scenario, it might stop and back up and ram their way through the pressure ridges, where it gets really thick,' he said. However, conditions are so cold that the ice quickly freezes around the tanker, requiring the Healy to back up and free it. Additionally, maneuvering is a problem. The tanker must stay close enough to its Coast Guard escort that the lanes through the ice freeze back over. However, that distance puts the two vessels at risk of slamming into each other. This means that progress is exceptionally slow during the long, dark nights, which last most of the day close to the Article Circle. Long way: The ships encountered the ice near Nanivak Island, about 300 miles from its destination of Nome Alaska .","Drone photographs ship's position and sending images to researchers .

"A paternity case between NBA Indiana Pacers player Paul George and former stripper Daniela Rajic was reportedly resolved Tuesday. 'They have reached a settlement with full joint custody and a financial package,' Harriet Newman Cohen, who is George's attorney, told Page Six. She continued, 'They will be raising their daughter together. Paul George had always intended to do the right thing, and he is thrilled to have a daughter. The settlement is generous, the child is going to have a wonderful life, and both parents will be equally involved in bringing her up.' Mother: Former stripper Daniela Rajic reportedly resolved a paternity case with NBA player Paul George, who is an NBA All-Star player . New move: A lawyer for Rajic has said that she and daughter Olivia Felder are going to relocate making regular visitation possible for George . George and Rajic are parents to a baby girl named Olivia. According to Page Six, last year Rajic was a Tootsie's Cabaret dancer - which is how she crossed paths with George. The media outlet reported that approximately $18million annually is made by George - and that his 2013 contract extension may be valued at over $90million. In a statement issued to Page Six, the parents together said 'We are both very grateful for the opportunity to be joint parents to our beautiful daughter Olivia. While we have our separate lives, we are committed to providing her with all the support, nurturing and love she deserves.' Fatherhood:Sources have said George was given the opportunity to have father-daughter time after breaking his leg in the summer on the court . Page Six reported that Raoul Felder, who represented Rajic, did not speak about the confidential settlement's terms. 'If this was baseball, they would say he stepped up to the plate,' Feder told the news outlet. However, Felder reportedly said that both Rajic and Olivia are going to relocate making regular visitation possible for George.

"Google is throwing its money, brain power and technology at the humble spoon. But these spoons  are a bit more than your basic utensil: Using hundreds of algorithms, they allow people with essential tremors and Parkinson's disease to eat without spilling. The technology senses how a hand is shaking and makes instant adjustments to stay balanced. In clinical trials, the Liftware spoons reduced shaking of the spoon bowl by an average of 76 percent. Scroll down for video . The technology senses how a hand is shaking and makes instant adjustments to stay balanced. In clinical trials, the Liftware spoons reduced shaking of the spoon bowl by an average of 76 percent. 'We want to help people in their daily lives today and hopefully increase understanding of disease in the long run,' Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari said. Other adaptive devices have been developed to help people with tremors — rocker knives, weighted utensils, pen grips. But until now, experts say, technology has not been used in this way. 'It's totally novel,' said UC San Francisco Medical Center neurologist Dr. Jill Ostrem, who specializes in movement disorders like Parkinson's disease and essential tremors. She helped advise the inventors and says the device, which has a fork attachment, has been a remarkable asset for some of her patients. 'I have some patients who couldn't eat independently, they had to be fed, and now they can eat on their own,' she said. 'It doesn't cure the disease — they still have tremor — but it's a very positive change.' Google got into the no-shake utensil business in September, acquiring a small, National of Institutes of Health-funded startup called Lift Labs for an undisclosed sum. The technology senses how a hand is shaking and makes instant adjustments to stay balanced. In clinical trials, the Liftware spoons reduced shaking of the spoon bowl by an average of 76 percent. 'The idea is to use active cancellation (which is currently in noise cancelling headphones) to stabilize larger scale motion,' said Anupam Pathak, it's inventor. 'At the University of Michigan, I was doing my PhD on new materials that can be used for active cancellation in the military. 'I figured out how to make the hardware for active cancellation of human tremor very small, and realized that this would be the perfect application for active cancellation technology.' In his studies, Pathak noticed little technology has been developed to help people with essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. 'People have tried making contraptions that force a person's tremor to cease, but these looked like robotic arms that I would hate to use in public. 'I thought that the concept of active cancellation would be of huge help here.' More than 10 million people worldwide, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin's mother, have essential tremors or Parkinson's disease. Brin has said he also has a mutation associated with higher rates of Parkinson's and has donated more than $50 million to research for a cure. But the Lift Labs acquisition was not related, Jabbari said. Anupam Pathak, a senior hardware engineer at Google, shows off the prototype of the Liftware Spoon he developed that helps people eat without spilling in Mountain View, Calif. Lift Lab founder Anupam Pathak said moving from a small, four-person startup in San Francisco to the vast Google campus in Mountain View has freed him up to be more creative as he explores how to apply the technology even more broadly. His team works at the search giant's division called Google(x) Life Sciences, which is also developing a smart contact lens that measures glucose levels in tears for diabetics and is researching how nanoparticles in blood might help detect diseases. Joining Google has been motivating, said Pathak, but his focus remains on people who are now able to eat independently with his device. 'If you build something with your hands and it has that sort of an impact, it's the greatest feeling ever,' he said. 'As an engineer who likes to build things, that's the most validating thing that can happen.' Pathak said they also hope to add sensors to the spoons to help medical researchers and providers better understand, measure and alleviate tremors. Shirin Vala, 65, who is an essential tremor patient, uses a Liftware Spoon to eat without spilling at her home in Oakland, Calif. Not surprisingly, the company that has brought the driverless car and Internet glasses is bringing a unique improvement to the utensils. Built with hundreds of algorithms, these specially designed spoons make it much easier for people with tremors and Parkinson's Disease to eat without spilling. Shirin Vala, 65, of Oakland, has had an essential tremor for about a decade. She was at her monthly Essential Tremor group at a San Ramon medical clinic earlier this year when researchers developing the device introduced the idea and asked if anyone was interested in helping them. As it was refined, she tried it out and gave them feedback. And when they hit the market at $295 apiece, she bought one. Without the spoon, Vala said eating was really a challenge because her hands trembled so hard food fell off the utensils before she could eat it. 'I was shaking and I had a hard time to keep the food on a spoon, especially soup or something like an olive or tomatoes or something. It is very embarrassing. It's very frustrating,' she said. The spoon definitely improved her situation. 'I was surprised that I held the food in there so much better. It makes eating much easier, especially if I'm out at a restaurant,' she said.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has called on moderate Muslims to stand up to local extremists, warning the community shouldn't be complacent against a possible 'mass casualty event'. Mr Abbott is meeting community leaders in Sydney on Monday and in Melbourne later in the week, to try to sell sweeping new anti-terror powers aimed at stopping Australian militants fighting overseas. The government is facing a backlash from Islamic groups, who fear they will be unfairly targeted by the new laws. Mr Abbott says Australia faces a serious threat from radicals who travel overseas to fight with terror groups in Syria and Iraq and then become 'militarised and brutalised' by the experience. Scroll down for video . Mr Abbott says everyone should put the people and the values of Australia first . Australian jihadists have recently captured headlines for their actions overseas, including convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf (right) Addressing a 'multicultural media conference' in Sydney's inner-west, Mr Abbott said the laws were not about protecting 'one group of Australians from another group of Australians', in an apparent reference to concerns from the Muslim community. He said it was in the 'absolute interests' of every community to 'expose and to counter any potential for home-grown terrorism'. 'Because if there is one thing that could damage the rich and strong social fabric of our country, it would be a mass casualty event,' he told the forum. Mr Abbott is concerned that the 150 Australians involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq may bring their radicalised view of Islam back to Australia. 'The last thing we should be is complacent about this,' Mr Abbott said. 'We've been successful up until now in identifying and preventing potential terrorism. 'I pray to God that we continue to be successful in this very important (area).' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf last week posted this picture of his son brandishing a severed head on Twitter . On the threat of terrorism: 'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia.' Reporters from AAP, Fairfax Media and the ABC were prevented from attending the event and were told that it was intended for 'multicultural media'. Mr Abbott earlier urged moderate Muslims to join the 'Team Australia' fight against locally-bred extremists. 'What we need to do is to encourage the moderate mainstream to speak out,' he told Macquarie Radio. 'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia. 'Everyone has got to put this country, its interest and its values and its people first.' He was also asked about reports that shops in Sydney's southwest were flying Islamic State flags despite the group being listed as a terrorist organisation. 'I don't know what the legal position is, but frankly, the only flag that should be flying is the Australian national flag,' he said. 'If people want to fly other flags - a corporate flag for instance - fine, but the Australian national flag should always be part of it.'","PM says Australia can't be complacent on terrorism .

"Vince Cable today warned Royal Mail to stop 'scaremongering' that deliveries which allow letters to be sent anywhere in the country for the same price are under threat. The Business Secretary said the firm - part-owned by the taxpayer - must stop 'whinging' about competition from rival companies 'cherry-picking' the delivery of letters and parcels in high density areas. It comes after Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, told MPs that the 'precious' universal service obligation is under threat with competitors undermining her firm's economics. Scroll down for video . Business Secretary Vince Cable hit back at claims from Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, that the the universal delivery service was being threatened by rival firms taking lucrative work in big cities . Last week profits in Royal Mail slumped after Amazon shook up the parcels market by setting up its own delivery network. Royal Mail profits fell from £353 million to £279 million. The universal service obligation (USO) cost £7.2 billion a year because of the high cost of delivering post to rural and remote areas of the UK. Giving evidence to the business select committee today, Ms Greene said: 'The universal service is a precious service. It its essential for most people in Britain and it has a fixed cost. 'It requires a number of internal subsidies in order to make the economics work. 'So for example, the low cost urban areas are needed - and mail that's high density and high volume mail are needed - to cross-subsidise the suburban and rural areas which are much higher cost. 'If you allow cherry-picking in urban areas you undermine the economics. It siphons off very quickly a lot of revenue. It makes the universal service uneconomic.' 'Unlike many universal services in the world, we do not require or rely on government subsidy.' She insisted the firm has made 'great strides' in making efficiencies. Royal Mail was part privatised last year in a controversial sell-off which critics claimed saw shares bought on the cheap. Today Mr Cable insisted the competition in the postal market was known at the time of the flotation and Royal Mail should stop suggesting the universal service was in jeopardy. He told IT News: 'It is scaremongering. There is no prospect of the universal service obligation being removed. 'The truth of the matter is the Royal Mail is operating in a very competitive market. 'We knew that when we brought in private ownership. It was very clear to anybody that bought shares that they were operating in this very competitive market. 'And we don't want frankly people whinging about it. They have got to compete.' Royal Mail needs the high volume, low cost work delivering letters in built-up areas to subsidise the cost of services in rural areas . Royal Mail has lost 50,000 staff in the last decade, and is shedding 2-3,000 jobs a year, she added. Letter deliveries are falling by around 4-6 per cent a year and competitors taking business off the Royal Mail in urban areas was making the USO 'uneconomic', she said. Officials from competitors Whistl and UK Mail denied they were cherry picking work, or that they threatened the universal service. But the Unite union warned: ' The postal service is a bit like the Nation Health Service (NHS). We want the assurance that it is there if we need it. 'However competitors to the Royal Mail are again like the privateers in the NHS. 'They are happy to do the ingrowing toe nails and the tonsil removal operation but, not to do those that require high cost / low return after care or expensive drug treatments.' Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), told the MPs: 'The sustainability of the USO faces its greatest threat.' As well as competition, postal workers were delivering to more and more addresses, while the number of letters was declining, he said. Mr Ward added that unions could not understand why the regulator Ofcom was still to decide if it will bring forward a review of the USO from next year. CWU general secretary Billy Hayes said he wanted Royal Mail's competitors to publish their employees' pay and conditions so there was transparency across the industry. As the UK's 'universal service' provider, Royal Mail is required to provide access to competitors such as TNT for final mile deliveries. Postal regulator Ofcom is investigating a complaint from TNT over Royal Mail's decision to change conditions and increase the prices it charges to deliver post collected and pre-sorted by its competitors. Labour's shadow trade minister Ian Murray said: 'This stark warning from the Chief Executive of Royal Mail will be deeply worrying for the millions of consumers and small businesses who rely on Royal Mail's six-day delivery and essential services. 'Labour warned that David Cameron's Royal Mail fire sale would put vital services at risk, and Moya Greene's evidence today has confirmed our worst fears. IT comes after taxpayers were short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds by the botched sale. 'Ministers urgently need to clarify what action they will take to secure the future of postal services following the mess created by their botched fire sale.'","Business Secretary hits back at claims universal service is in jeopardy .

"Twelve members of a single Brooklyn-based family were charged Thursday with lying about being wealthy to obtain mortgages or lying about being poor to get food stamps and other benefits. Some did both, the indictment said . 'They alternately played the part of prince or pauper depending on which scam was being perpetrated,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a news conference in the White Plains courthouse. 'Regardless of whether they were posing as rich men or poor men, they were always con men.' He said one indicted couple claimed monthly income of $25,000 when taking out a mortgage and $180 when applying for food stamps and Medicaid. The fraudulently obtained mortgages totaled more than $20 million and the welfare fraud realized about $700,000 in benefits, the indictment said. Scroll down for video . Authorities: Carl DuBois, the sheriff of New Yorkís Orange County, speaks with reporters following an announcement by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, left,on the unsealing of an indictment charging the defendants . Scam: FBI Assistant Director George Venizelos, left, addresses the media. The indictment alleges that 12 members of a single family lied to lenders over the past decade to falsely obtain more than $20 million in mortgages and other loans . Yehuda Rubin, 29, of Monroe, was described in the indictment as 'an organizer' of the scheme but Bharara would not say he was the leader. Rubin's father, Irving Rubin, 58, of Brooklyn, is the lead defendant. Both men pleaded not guilty later Thursday to charges of bank fraud and making false statements. The maximum penalty is 30 years in prison. Other defendants include Irving Rubin's wife, another son, three brothers and five in-laws. Three unrelated men also were charged, including a real estate lawyer and an appraiser. Eleven of the 15 defendants live in Brooklyn. Thirteen were arrested Thursday and the other two were expected to surrender, Bharara said. The indictment said family members lied to lenders about their assets, income, employment and primary residence to obtain mortgages on at least 18 properties they claimed to own, most of them in Brooklyn. Scheme: U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara references a chart as he announces the indictment charging the defendants with bank and wire fraud . Bogus: The indictment said family members lied to lenders about their assets, income, employment and primary residence to obtain mortgages on at least 18 properties they claimed to own, most of them in Brooklyn . The lies gave 'the false appearance of creditworthiness, when in fact the assets and/or bank accounts were nonexistent' or were not fully owned by the applicant, the indictment said. The defendants used the proceeds to pay their credit card debts and their own home mortgages and to fund other real estate projects, Bharara said. When the loans defaulted, he said, the defendants would lie again, either to claim poverty or to claim they had found buyers who would take the properties - at a discount. Bharara said the overall deception was so widespread that prosecutors still do not know exactly what properties the defendants own or how wealthy they are. 'It's hard to find any examples of when they told the truth,' he said. But the government is asking the court to order forfeiture of 23 properties and several bank accounts.","Twelve members of a single Brooklyn-based family have been charged with either lying about being wealthy to obtain fraudulent mortgages or lying about being poor to get food stamps and other benefits .

"Increasing numbers of students are taking the pills which are being sold online for as little as £2 each . Growing numbers of students at some of Britain’s best universities may be putting their health at risk after an ‘explosion’ in the numbers taking a ‘smart drug’ bought via the internet. Doctors say increasing numbers of teenagers are using the prescription-only medicine Modafinil to stay awake and alert for long periods. The drug is designed to combat narcolepsy. However, research shows it is available to anyone from dozens of online retailers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that as the . new academic year begins there is now a black market at universities . including Oxford and Cambridge with students selling it to each other . for around £2 a pill, Sky News has reported. Some students are said to be demanding drug tests before exams to eliminate a practice they believe . to be equivalent to cheating. One Oxford student said he believed that up to a quarter of his student friends had taken Modafinil, of which the long-term effects are not known. Buying prescription-only drugs is not illegal, although supplying them is. Barbara Sahakian, professor of clinical neuropsychology at Cambridge University, said there had been an ‘explosion’ in the number of students taking Modafinil in recent years. She said: 'A lot of young people are purchasing . these drugs over the internet, which is a very unsafe way to get these . drugs because you don’t really know what you’re getting and you don’t . know if it’s safe for you as an individual.' Ms Sahakian added some students feel pressure to take the drug in order to keep up with their fellow students. 'There’s this kind of coercion that goes on. 'I think a lot of students feel it’s very unfair that other students are . taking these drugs during exams and they feel that they’re losing out . because the other person has a competitive advantage. 'Some students feel when you go into the exam perhaps there should be a . test to see whether you’re on the drug or not, because otherwise there’s . no way of detecting whether you are or not.' Though Universities UK said there is no firm evidence that taking 'smart drugs' is widespread among students, Professor Sahakiann expressed concern for the growing problem. 'What are the effects of putting a drug into and changing the chemicals in your brain as your brain’s developing?' she asked. 'What will society be like in the future? Will we all be just popping pills to stay awake, and alert and keep working? Will we accelerate into a 24/7 society? Is that what we really want?' Laurie Pycroft, a masters student at Oxford University, admits taking the drug every few weeks. He said: 'Some people report that they become very focused or very good at concentrating on a repetitive task. 'I have found the ability to go without sleep, when necessary, quite effective. It’s essentially like caffeine, just a bit more effective and with less jitters. 'The people I’ve met who offer me Modafinil for sale, they’ve all been fellow students, or academic types, rather than your stereotypical wheeler dealer in a hoodie down a dark alley.' Dr Anders Sandberg, research fellow at Oxford University’s Future of Humanity Institute uses Modafinil every one or two weeks. Some university students are calling for drug testing before exams as they feel their classmates who take the drugs are 'cheating' While he believes he is doing himself no harm, he would rather be able to get the drug from his GP. 'Going via an internet drug store means the money ends up in the grey market, and that’s problematic,' he said. 'You might be feeding your money into a market that is actually doing a lot of harm in the world. It would be much better if it were in the open market, which would mean that we could actually control that it’s actually healthy, that side effects get reported, that you could actually study it properly. 'I don’t regard the use itself as immoral or problematic. I’m not competing with anyone else. I am taking the risks on my own.' Buying prescription only drugs is not illegal. However, supplying them is. Universities UK released statement however contradicting people's concerns the problem is growing out of control. They said: 'We would be very concerned if the impression were given that most students at UK universities are now taking...’smart drugs’. We are not aware of any new research or data to suggest that such drugs are widely used and available among the UK’s higher education student population of 2.5 million students. 'Such unsubstantiated claims could cause real and unnecessary alarm to students and parents and, perversely, could serve to inspire students to obtain such drugs illegally for fear of being at a competitive disadvantage. 'UK universities take the issue of drug abuse very seriously and would have grave concerns about students taking drugs not prescribed to them by a doctor. Not only is this illegal but it also poses health risks to those students. 'All universities have policies relating to alcohol and substance abuse. 'All . universities would advise students under pressure to seek advice from . university counselling services, welfare officers or their GP.' Students at top universities such as Oxford (pictured) and Cambridge are among the many who have resorted to taking 'smart drugs' during exams . A spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: 'Modafinil is a prescription only medicine. 'It should only be taken following a full consultation with a doctor who can fully assess you for any possible risks associated with taking a medicine. 'People who buy medicines without the benefit of a consultation with an appropriate healthcare professional run the risk being supplied with medicines that are not safe or suitable for them to use.' An Oxford spokesman said: 'If ‘cognitive enhancement’ drugs are a particular problem at Oxford we have yet to see any substantive evidence for it. We would strongly advise students against taking any drugs that have not been prescribed to them as this could involve putting their health at risk.' A spokesman for Cambridge said: 'The use of prescription drugs without the approval of a qualified medical practitioner is not to be recommended under any circumstance as unforeseen side effects can be serious. 'Hence we would advise any student to take appropriate medical advice before considering taking any prescription drugs, including those such as Modafinil, Ritalin, or Adderrall. 'More generally, we would encourage students to talk to their supervisors, tutor, director of studies or senior tutor if they’re having difficulties with their studies for any reason. 'By sharing any problems, they together should be able to develop improved academic good practice and appropriate confidence. 'These should do away with any perceived need for performance enhancers of any type other than those developed through expertise and academic study.'","Students have resorted to taking narcolepsy drugs to stay alert .

"Hearing the sound of birdsong and listening to music is something most of us take for granted, but around one in every 1,000 babies is born deaf and many people lose their hearing as they get older. Cochlear implants have revolutionised life for people who are deaf or hearing impaired and cannot benefit from a hearing aid. But until recently, the experts who design and implant the devices have not known what they sound like. Now, scientists have revealed what it sounds like to hear via an implant. Scroll down for video . Cochlear implants (pictured) enable some people who are deaf or hearing impaired who cannot benefit from a standard hearing aid, hear again. Now scientists have revealed what the world sounds like through their ears . The cochlear implant is a surgically placed under the skin behind the ear and includes microphones to pick up sounds and a speech processor to prioritise audible speech externally - splitting the sound into channels and sending the electrical sound signals though a thin cable to the transmitter. The transmitter is a coil held in position by a magnet placed behind the external ear that transmits power and the processed sound signals across the skin to the internal device by electromagnetic induction. A receiver and stimulator secured in the bone beneath the skin concerts the signals into electric impulses and sends them though an internal cable to electrodes. An array of electrodes wound through the cochlea send the impulses to the nerves in the scala tympani and then to the brain through the auditory nerve system. As of December 2012, approximately 324,000 people worldwide have received cochlear implants. In the best case scenario, the implants, which convert sound to electric impulses that travel to the brain, allow patients who cannot hear anything at all to achieve 100 per cent speech understanding. Michael Dorman, an Arizona State University professor of speech and hearing science, made the discovery of what the world sounds like via an implant, when one of his patients who had lost hearing in both ears and had received an implant, regained his natural hearing in one of his ears. ‘That allowed us to have him match the sound quality of an implant with his hearing ear,’ he said. ‘And we'd always wondered, “what does it really sound like?”’ ‘It was a tremendous help to us in understanding cochlear implants.’ The experts first experimented with tones in order to pinpoint what certain frequencies sound like to someone wearing an implant. The video shows that they appear slightly echoey, but nonetheless amazing to someone who has been without the ability to hear either temporarily or since birth. They then showed what speech sounds like via a cochlear implant and it is clear – if slightly more robotic than natural hearing. Professor Dorman’s team is currently working on a project to test the performance of patients by using a surround sound system that is calibrated so that if someone sits in the middle of the array of speakers, it sounds as if they are in a restaurant. Busy spaces like restaurants can be a difficult places to distinguish speech for people with hearing difficulties. 'It's really a striking replication of the environment and will help them evaluate new signalling algorithms for the implant,’ he said.

"A blind and bleeding mole has been nursed back to health by the SSPCA after it survived a near death encounter with a 'psycho' cat. Cosmo, a half Bengal house cat, caught and carried the mole as a gift to his sleeping owner Natalie Johnson on Saturday morning. In her shock, Ms Johnson thought the mole was a rat and threw Cosmo out of the window. But the cat got such a shock the mole escaped and was picked up by Ms Johnson before Cosmo could gather his wits. The blind and defenceless mole pictured during its rehabilitative stay with the local SSPCA branch in Clackmannanshire, near Stirling . The mole was released after having its bloody nose cleaned and eating several bowls of mealworms . He had been caught and carried inside by Cosmo (pictured), a half Bengal house cat known for hunting down smaller animals such as bats . Natalie Johnson, who lives in Bannockburn, Stirling, claims her cat Cosmo (pictured) is a 'psycho' Ms Johnson, a 48-year-old IT support worker who lives in Bannockburn, Stirling, said: 'He jumped in the bedroom window with it. 'I didn't have my contacts on so I thought it was a rat at first, I quickly threw him out the window then ran downstairs to the garden to make sure he didn't bring it in the house. 'I think he got quite a shock at my reaction and dropped it in the garden.' She added: 'The mole did a runner across the garden and straight into a wall, probably because they're blind. Once I chased Cosmo away I followed it along the wall and picked it up. 'It had a bloody nose from hitting the wall but apart from that it didn't seem injured so I put it in a shoe box in the dark and called the SPCA.' It has now been nursed back to health by the SSPCA and released having suffered nothing worse than a bloody nose after running into the wall in its desperation to escape Cosmo. Natalie Johnson got such a fright when her cat brought her a mole she threw the cat out the window then rescued the little mole . The incident is not the first time an unusual victim of Cosmo's has had a lucky escape - he previously caught a bat and released it in the kitchen. She added: 'I never realised he was such a psycho because I never had a garden before so he wasn't able to go out but since moving here he's brought back all sorts of things. 'He's even brought back a bat that he let loose in the kitchen. I came downstairs to this bat flying in my kitchen which was terrifying but thankfully it managed to escape out the window.' Cosmo is a half British Blue and half Bengal cat, and according to his owner, 'probably more Bengal - which would explain a lot.' The mole was taken to the charity's National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Clackmannanshire and released the following day. Centre manager Colin Seddon said, 'Moles are very difficult to keep in captivity as they have a high metabolic rate and have to feed constantly on earthworms. 'Thankfully he was relatively unscathed and his injuries were not serious. 'We kept the mole in a tank half filled with earth to burrow into which he did as soon as he was put in it. 'He cleared a couple of bowls of mealworms overnight and was fit enough to be released the following day close to where he came from.'","Predatory house cat Cosmo captured the mole then brought it to its owner .

"A 16-year-old accused of opening fire in an ice rink in Manhattan's Bryant Park grinned, laughed and cursed at reporters as he was led by police to a court arraignment on Monday evening. 'F*** all you n******,' Corey Dunton yelled as two detectives from the Midtown South Precinct station ushered him into a waiting car before driving to the court. Dunton is accused of shooting two people at the ice rink on Saturday night, including Adonis Mera, an innocent 14-year-old who may be paralyzed from the waist down. The shooting was reportedly over a 'biggie' jacket. Grinning: Shooting suspect Corey Dunton, pictured, grinned, laughed and cursed at reporters as he was led by police to a court arraignment on Monday evening . But, according to the New York Daily News, the Bronx teen told reporters, smirking: 'It wasn't over a jacket. It was over your mother, n*****.' Dunton was charged with attempted murder on Sunday after he allegedly shot at skaters and then seemed to confess to the crime on Facebook. During an hour-long standoff at his Bronx apartment on Sunday morning, Corey Dunton, 16, wrote on the social media website: 'Feds trien [sic] kick down my door its over were do i go from hereeeee...[I don't know] wat to do i f----ed up.' Minutes later, he added: 'These n----s gunna have to take me out take my life … I aint goin to jail i reather [sic] take my life!!' He is suspected to be a member of the Bloods gang. When police began banging on his door at . around 8 a.m., he posted: 'Feds at my door Im goin out with a . bang!!!!!!! take my soul.' Detained for questioning: Corey Dunton is suspected by the NYPD of carrying out the shooting at Bryant Park skating rink that left two people hospitalized . When he finally emerged, he was taken . to the Midtown South precinct house in Manhattan after he was arrested . but he refused to answer questions and demanded a lawyer. The teenager allegedly fired on . Javier Contreras, 20, of the Bronx, but in doing so hit Mera . of Manhattan. Police . believe that Contreras was targeted for the particular Marmot Mammoth . 'biggie' jacket he was wearing and was shot in the hand and the hips. A source with the NYPD confirmed that Contreras and Dunton knew each other. The arrest of Dunton comes after the distraught family of 14-year-old Mera expressed their fears he will never walk again. Currently being held in Bellevue Hospital in a critical but stable condition, Mera's brother Jorge Arias told the New York Daily News he visited his injured sibling. Harrowing scene: Twitter user Raghuram Krishnamachari shared this image of paramedics attending to two people who were shot while skating on the ice rink in Bryant Park saturday night . Dispute: NYPD believe that Corey Dunton entered into an argument with Javier Contreras, 20, of the Bronx, over a particular style of jacket . Video Source YouTube . 'I didn't really try to get him to speak,' Arias, 24, said. 'I just wanted to see his face. He's a baby. He's a little kid.' Contreras was approached by the gunman and asked to hand over his jacket. When he refused the shooter left the rink but returned minutes later to unleash three gunshots - hitting both Contreras and Mera. This is not the first time the puffy 'biggie' jacket has become a source of problems in New York. The jacket, which costs $600, is believed to be the source of a scuffle in the Lower East Side earlier this year which led to Raphael Ward, 16, being shot in the chest over the coat. The coat was discontinued by Paragon Sports last year and as such has become a desirable and rare piece of fashion. Facebook: The alleged shooter took to Facebook early Sunday morning in a series of posts including the above . Desirable: Police believe that Contreras was targeted for the particular Marmot Mammoth 'biggie' jacket - which are no longer made and retailed for $600 . The shocking incident happened just . after 11pm Saturday, on the skating rink in the heart of the popular . midtown park located at 42nd Street and 6th Avenue. Witnesses of the harrowing incident took to Twitter to share their accounts and photos from the crime scene. 'People just fell on the floor because they heard a gunshot and they had ice skating skates on so they couldn't run,' said Raghuram Krishnamachar, 29, of Brooklyn, who was eating dinner with his girlfriend and her family at the park's second-floor restaurant Celsius. 'People were scared they didn't know what was going on,' he said. Krishnamachar said he heard three shots ring out and saw skaters down below scramble for safety, while one person lay motionless on the rink. He posted a photo of the scene on Twitter. Full house: The free-admission ice rink was teeming with skaters just moments before gunfire erupted . Gunned down: Police say one of the victims was hit in the back while the other was struck in the leg . He said restaurant patrons were told to lie on the floor and eventually were ushered to a back room. 'We didn't know anything. The shooter could've been a lunatic with a machine gun,' he said. A witness told the New York Times Saturday night that he saw a man skate up to another person in the middle of the rink, pull a gun and open fire. In total, three shots reportedly rang out, sending park goers running for cover, some of them wearing only socks. A young woman believed to be a victim's sister was heard exclaiming, 'My brother just got shot in front of my face.' Christopher Guerrero, 19, said one of the victims was his friend Adonis Mera. Victim: One of the Bryant Park shooting victims has been identified as Adonis Mera . Skating enthusiast: Shortly before the shooting, Mera posted a message on his Facebook page saying that Bryant Park was crowded . Mera's friend who witnessed the shooting said the teen told him he could not feel his legs . According to Mr Guerrero, the teenager told him he could not feel his legs as he was lying on the ice. On his Facebook account, Mera posted a message Friday about his weekend plans: 'Catch me at Bryant Park!!' Shortly before the shooting, the boy wrote on his page that the park was packed with people. Early Sunday morning, Mera's numerous friends and well-wishers took to Twitter to post messages of support for the injured young man. Arelis Marie wrote: 'The fact that people can't go ice skating without someone tryna catch a body is crazy! Pull through Adonis, we're praying for you.' Terrifying moment: A paramedic is attending to Adonis Mera, who was shot on the ice rink . First aid: Mera was loaded into a  waiting ambulance with his skates still on and rushed to Bellevue Hospital . NYPD officers . converged on the park after receiving reports of shots fired and . quarantined some 50  skaters, who were later released after being . questioned by police. Joe . Carella, a spokesman for Bryant Park Corporation, the not-for-profit . company that privately manages the park, said the public area is virtually . crime free. In the 1970s, Bryant Park, like much of Midtown Manhattan, had been taken over by drug dealers, prostitutes and homeless people and was considered a no-go zone by law-abiding city dwellers. The park went through a massive overhaul in the late 80s, emerging as an exemplary urban green space after a 4-year renovation, which was praised by Time Magazine as a 'small miracle.' Manhunt: Police are searching for a suspect with dreadlocks and a red hoodie . Quarantine: Police secured the rink and questioned the park goers before letting them leave . These days, the park is packed with office workers on fair-weather weekdays, tourists and families on the weekends and ice skating enthusiasts during the winter months. In 2005, Bryant Park introduced Citi Pond - a free ice skating rink that became a fixture in the Manhattan holiday scene. It is open until midnight on the weekends.","Corey Dunton, 16, grinned, laughed and cursed at reporters as he was led by police to a court arraignment on Monday evening .

"If you already have your concerns about the number of young children using mobile phones, the situation is set to get even worse. By 2020, Ericsson predicts that as many as 90 per cent of the world’s population over six years old will own a handset. And within the next six years, the total number of people globally with smartphones could exceed 6.1 billion - up from this year’s 2.7 billion. By 2020, Ericsson predicts that as many as 90 per cent of the world’s population over six years old will own a mobile phone. Sales in Europe will reach  95% by 2020, while in the Middle East, numbers will peak at 55% . The predictions come from Ericsson’s latest Mobility Report, which tracks trends around mobiles, data and networks worldwide. The report claims that in the near future, there will be significant regional differences when it comes to people buying smartphones. For example, sales in Europe will reach around 95 per cent by 2020, while in the Middle East they will peak at 55 per cent. Gadgets, Google and social sites such as Facebook are leading children to mature much faster than in previous generations. The majority of parents in a recent poll by BullGuard admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly, and 77 per cent blamed the web. They attributed this accelerated maturity, in particular, to peer pressure, the vast amount of information they see online, and social networks. And many of these devices will predominantly be used to watch videos. In fact, Ericsson predicts that video traffic will increase tenfold by 2020, and make up 55 per cent of all mobile data traffic. Devices used to watch videos will also evolve, explained the report. Many  will have larger screens, higher picture quality and, with the advent of 5G, will have improved streaming quality inside, and outside the home. Rima Qureshi, Senior Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of M&A, Ericsson, said: ""The falling cost of handsets, coupled with improved usability and increasing network coverage, are factors that are making mobile technology a global phenomenon that will soon be available to the vast majority of the world's population, regardless of age or location.’ ‘The Ericsson Mobility Report shows that in 2020 the world will be connected like never before,’ Mr Qureshi added. Over the past three months, 70 per cent of all phones sold were smartphones, compared with 55 per cent in the same quarter for 2013. The report is the seventh edition of the Ericsson Mobility Report. A recent survey from BullGuard found that gadgets, Google and social sites such as Facebook are leading children to mature much faster than in previous generations.

"A couple 'traded in' their daughter for a used car to a family who used her as a domestic slave for three years, a court in France was told. The 23-year-old woman was sold in £600 'part-exchange' for a second-hand hatchback - then subjected to daily sexual and physical abuse at a travellers' camp outside Paris. The daughter - named only as Sabrina - was then forced to live in a squalid shed owned by Franck Franoux, 58, and his partner Florence Carrasco, 56, in the suburb of Melun. Squalid: The shed on a site outside Paris where the girl known as Sabrina was kept as a sex slave . She was burned with an iron and cigarette ends, made to look after their seven children, beaten with iron bars and sticks and hired out for sex to other men. When she finally fell critically ill in 2006, she was dumped outside a Paris hospital, with no teeth left and weighting less than six stone, the court heard. The woman's father was sentenced to 20 years in prison and her mother to eight years for human trafficking in an initial trial two years ago. Franoux and Carrasco were both sentenced to 30 years on charges of rape, kidnapping, torture and forced slavery. All four are now appealing their sentences at a court in Bobigny, near Paris. Police told the first trial: 'The girl's parents handed their daughter over to another couple in part exchange for a used car, with her value being estimated at around £600. The victim, known as Sabrina, was sold to work as a domestic slave and taken to Melun, site of a traveller camp outside Paris, where she was sexually abused . 'She was treated worse than an animal, with beatings, sexual abuse and scraps of food being tossed on the ground for her to eat. 'Her identity papers were stolen while her captors illegally claimed her unemployment benefit, and she was chained up at night to prevent her escaping. 'She was in a deplorable physical and psychological state. 'She needed reconstructive operations on her nose and ears, which had been mutilated. 'It took her a year to recover from her ordeal and she will bear the physical and mental scars all her life.' A verdict in the ongoing appeal trial is expected on September 14.","Woman, named only as 'Sabrina' was sold in £600 part-exchange to travellers who kept her as a slave .

"A crowd of 300 angry protestors forced three buses carrying 140 undocumented migrant children and their parents to turn around in Murrieta, California, on Tuesday after they blocked the road. The dramatic confrontation between the flag waving protestors and the Homeland Security buses came one day after Mayor Alan Long urged residents to resist the federal government's plan to transfer the Central American migrants to California to ease overcrowding of facilities along the Texas-Mexico border. Holding up banners that said 'Return to Sender' and suggesting the children should be sent to the White House instead, the irate protestors succeeded when the buses turned around and headed to a customs and border facility in San Diego - within sight of Mexico.

Demonstrators picket against the possible arrivals of undocumented migrants who may be processed at the Murrieta Border Patrol Station . Border Patrol agents watch as demonstrators picket against the possible arrivals of undocumented migrants who may be processed at the Murrieta Border Patrol Station . The illegal immigrants had been flown from Texas to California on Tuesday and arrived at 2pm to face many Murrieta residents furiously protesting the processing of the migrants to the Riverside County city US Customs and Border Protection facility. It was the first flight planned for California under the federal government's effort to ease the crunch in the Rio Grande Valley and deal with the flood of Central American children and families fleeing to the United States. Many of the immigrants were detained while escaping violence and extortion from gangs in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The government is also planning to fly migrants to Texas cities and another site in California, and has already taken some migrants to Arizona. Unequivocal: The protestors did not hold back with their strident opinions outside of Murrieta .

Buses packed with undocumented migrants who were scheduled to be processed at the Murrieta Border Patrol Station retreat up the road after being stopped in their tracks by demonstrators . More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained after crossing the Texas-Mexico border since October in what President Barack Obama has called a humanitarian crisis. As the caravan neared its destination, a group of 150 protesters waiving American flags and shouting 'Go home - we don't want you here,' filled a street leading to the access road for the Border Patrol station, blocking the buses from reaching the facility. The demonstrators disregarded orders shouted by local police to disperse, but officers did not attempt to intervene physically to break up the demonstration. After about 25 minutes, the buses backed up, turned around and left. A board member of the union representing border patrol agents, Chris Harris, said the buses would likely be rerouted to one of six other Border Patrol stations in the San Diego sector. Lois Haley, a spokesman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, declined to say where the buses were headed. 'For the security of everybody ... we're just not saying anything about any contingency plans now.' Many of the migrants are under the impression that they will receive leniency from US authorities. Another flight was expected to take 140 migrants to a facility in El Centro, California, on Wednesday, said Lombardo Amaya, president of the El Centro chapter of the Border Patrol union. The Border Patrol would not confirm that arrival date. Mayor Alan Long has warned his citizens to expect busloads of people every 72 hours for the next several weeks, while Mayor Pro-Tem Harry Ramos has warned that Tuesday's standoff could be repeated in the coming days. ‘I believe that there will be protests every time there are buses on track,’ he told a local radio station.

The detainees are primarily children and were supposed to be placed under the supervision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials before being reunited with family through the United States. However, Long said that by sending the migrants to Murrieta the federal government is not enforcing immigration laws. 'Murrieta expects our government to enforce our laws, including the deportation of illegal immigrants caught crossing our borders, not disperse them into local communities,' said Long.

'What kind of criminality will happen?' 'The Democrats are making it easy for them to come here so they can produce more Democratic voters.' Police were on standby, but the protest passed without incident, bar the u-turn performed by the buses. Long urged residents in the suburb of 107,000 people some 60 miles north of San Diego to call their elected officials and voice opposition to the plan. 'We want to make sure everyone is doing what they say they're going to do,' Long told reporters. U.S. authorities announced last week that Central American migrants would be flown from the Rio Grande Valley to Texas cities and Southern California.

"Joan Rivers' 'outraged' daughter will sue throat specialist to the stars Dr Gwen Korovin, friends have revealed. Melissa Rivers is preparing to launch legal action against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, which was blasted yesterday in a damning report by the New York Department of Health and Human Services. And she will not just include the clinic in her legal action - but her mother's personal ENT doctor as well. A source told MailOnline today: 'Melissa is undaunted, she's going after the clinic and the doctors personally involved. These doctors will rue the day they went near Joan.' The DHH report revealed a catalog of errors at the clinic where the legendary comic suffered a heart attack during a routine throat procedure that led to her death. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Melissa Rivers, right, has hired a top NYC law firm to launch legal action against the clinic where her mother Joan suffered cardiac arrest following a routine endoscopy before her death on September 4 . Joan's doctors: Dr Gwen Korovin (left)  is Joan's private throat specialist, while Dr Lawrence Cohen was the medical director at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic. Both are believed to have been treating Joan Rivers when she went into cardiac arrest during a routine endoscopy on August 28 . Among the series of blunders, it was reported that staff at the Manhattan clinic failed to weigh Joan before sedating her with Propofol - the anesthetic that killed Michael Jackson. The clinic also comes under fire for allowing a doctor without privileges, known to be Dr Korovin, to practice at the medical center. Indeed, Dr Korovin is said to have declared 'I'll go first' as she stepped into the operating room with Dr Cohen, the report says. It also confirms a picture was taken of the star while she was under anesthesia, alongside Dr Korovin. Heartbroken Melissa Rivers, 46, will file a multimillion-dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Yorkville  and is working with top firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz. In a statement, attorneys Jeffrey B. Bloom and Ben Rubinowitz said: 'Our client, Melissa Rivers, is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the CMS report. 'As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure. Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.' Meanwhile, the friend said that although grief-stricken, Melissa wants to continue to produce her mother's E! show Fashion Police in memory of Joan. The network is looking to replace the venerable Joan, although the star's close friend Kathy Griffin, who has been linked with the spot, told People: 'They did offer it to me. I don't know if the situation is correct or right at this time for me. We'll see.' ​Rivers’ official cause of death is “anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation.” The firm needs to obtain Joan's medical records before filing a case in Manhattan Supreme Court and her will also needs to submitted to court and an executor appointed by the judge. On Monday, the DHH reported that the legendary comic was in excellent health before undergoing what was supposed to be a routine endoscopy. While the doctors who treated Joan are not mentioned by name, they are believed to be her personal throat specialist Dr Gwen Korovin and Yorkville medical director Dr Lawrence Cohen. And most worryingly,  both Dr Korovin and Dr Cohen failed to notice that Joan's vital signs were going down, as the report claims they failed to provide 'timely intervention'. According to the findings, Joan, 81, arrived at Yorkville on the morning of August 28 for tests after suffering chronic reflux. She was in good health and her blood pressure was a normal 118 over 80 when her vital signs were first taken at 8.44am. Her pulse was 62 and regular. The star was set to undergo an EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy), where doctors insert a thin scope and camera into the area between the throat and upper intestine. However, even though Joan had only agreed to only the ONE procedure, the report states she underwent a Nasolaryngoscopy performed by her personal ENT doctor Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to practice at the clinic. This was stopped when Dr Koroway said she did not have a clear view. The EGD then went ahead, carried out by Dr Cohen, and Dr Korovin performed a second Nasolaryngoscopy. Worryingly, a staff member told the DHH investigators that Joan was NOT weighed before Propofol was administered. This is 'critical' according to the report. The records note an 'inconsistent' log of the Propofol dosage. Although it says she was given a total of 300 milligrams, the clinic's anestiologist said this was a mistake and only 120 milligrams was administered. Propofol hit the headlines after the death of superstar Michael Jackson in 2009, when it was revealed he had overdosed on the powerful sedative. BFFs: Distraught Melissa posted a picture of her son Cooper and her mother Joan, writing: 'Connecticut, 2004. Mom + Cooper = BFFs... A perfect day. #TBT' Still working: Dr Gwen Korovin is still working at her Manhattan office. She charges $460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance. She is believed to have been in the room at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest on August 28 . Perhaps the most damning criticism of the clinic comes as the report says 'the physicians in charge of Joan failed to identify deteriorating  vital signs and provide timely intervention during the procedure'. Indeed, by 9.30am, Joan's blood pressure had plunged to 85 over 49 and no pulse was recorded. The report, released after interviews with Yorkville staff and others, says there is conflicting information as to the time that Joan was resuscitated and transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital. Last month, it was revealed that Joan's daughter Melissa Rivers has signed up a Manhattan legal powerhouse and will launch a multimillion-dollar law suit against the endoscopy clinic where the comedienne fell into a coma. Today, Dr Korovin's lawyer, Michael Kelton, declined to comment. Dr Korovin is known as the throat specialist to the stars and counts Celine Dion and Ariana Grande as well as a host of Broadway stars among her patients. Previously, Mr Kelton told MailOnline: 'Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who is believed to have been in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her ill-fated procedure, counts Celine Dion as one of her patients. In the singer's 2010 documentary, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords . 'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. 'For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.'","Joan Rivers died age 81 on September 4 at Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC .

"A patient believed to have been in a vegetative state for more than a decade has been able to communicate using the power of thought. Scott Routley, who was left severely brain damaged after a car crash, has managed to tell his doctors he is not in any pain. He is one of several such patients being treated using a pioneering technique developed by researchers at Cambridge University. Scroll down for video . Incredible development: Scott Routley (pictured) has been in a vegetative state for ten years but can finally communicate - using the power of thought . Scott’s case marks the first time a patient said to be in a permanent vegetative state has been able to answer questions relating to his care – suggesting he is aware of his condition. It also means he can communicate in a way that could help doctors improve his quality of life. Professor Adrian Owen uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to detect changes in the flow of the blood around the brain. Scott, from Ontario, Canada, and British patient Alex Seaman both feature in a BBC1 Panorama programme on the groundbreaking approach to brain-injured patients tonight. A team led by Professor Adrian Owen (pointing at screen) study brain scans from Scott Routley . Mr Routley has been able to confirm his father's name and that he has a niece . First, patients are asked to imagine they are playing tennis. This prompts an increase in blood-flow to an area at the front of the brain called the premotor cortex, which can be detected by the scan. Patients are then told to picture themselves walking around different rooms in their house. This activates an entirely separate area of the brain, the parahippocampal gyrus, situated in the middle. A functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) machine measure real-time activity of the brain by tracking the flow of oxygen rich blood in the brain. Patients are asked repeatedly to imagine playing tennis or walking around their home. This demonstrates consciousness. In healthy volunteers imagining the scenarios produces distinct patterns of activity in the brain. Scientists have matched these to a minority of severely injured patients. Once these patterns have been established, patients can answer yes or no by imagining either walking around the home or playing tennis. They are then asked a question and told to imagine they are playing tennis if the answer is no and if yes, to pretend they are walking round the house. From the subsequent changes in blood flow, doctors can work out their answers. The technique has been successfully used on a number of vegetative patients at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge and by Prof Owen at the Brain and Mind Institute of Western Ontario in London, Canada. Prof Owen said: 'Asking a patient . something important to them has been our aim for many years. In future . we could ask that we could do to improve their quality of life.' Scott is the first to have been able . to answer whether he was in pain. On two occasions in the last six . months he has told doctors ‘no’ by imagining he was playing tennis. Until then patients had responded to basic questions such as ‘is your . father’s name Alexander?’ or ‘do you have a niece?’ Doctors hope that over the coming . weeks Scott will be able to answer questions such as what time he . prefers to be bathed or given his dinner. His family also want to know whether he likes listening to ice hockey on the radio. ‘Scott . has been able to show he has a conscious, thinking mind,’ Professor . Owen said. ‘We have scanned him several times and his pattern of brain . activity shows he is clearly choosing to answer our questions. We . believe he knows who and where he is.’ Scott's parents said they always thought he was conscious and could communicate by lifting a thumb or moving his eyes, but this was never accepted by medical staff. Professor . Bryan Young of University Hospital in London, Ontario, who has been . Scott’s neurologist for a decade, said: ‘He had the clinical picture of a . typical vegetative patient – no emotional response, no fixation or . following with his eyes. He didn’t have any spontaneous movements that . looked meaningful and I was quite impressed and amazed that he was able . to show these cognitive responses with fMRI.’ The medical team use brain scanning to detect hidden awareness in patients and to enable them to communicate . The Canadian was asked to imagine playing tennis if he wanted to answer no to various questions while he was in an MRI scanner . Not all vegetative patients can respond using this technique as it requires so much concentration. Professor Owen says that about one in five who have scans can answer questions. Alex de Martelly Seaman, 20, suffered severe brain injuries last year when he jumped off a moving bus. He had to have a large section of his skull removed due to internal bruising. Alex was too ill to have a full assessment at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney, which collaborates with the team at Cambridge University. However, despite appearing vegetative his brain scans show he is minimally conscious. He has some periods of awareness and may be able to recognise the faces of his family and friends.

"A grieving Afghan mother took bloody revenge on the Taliban militants who gunned down her son, killing 25 and injuring five of them during a seven hour gun battle.

'I couldn't stop myself and picked up a weapon,' Gul told TOLO News. 'I went to the check post and began shooting back.' Her daughter-in-law Seema added: 'The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet.' She added that the combats zone was strewn with Taliban bodies when the fighting was over. A spokesman for the Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior told the agency it was a symbol of a public uprising. The Taliban is yet to comment about the incident. Alongside other insurgent groups, the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month. Targeting, government, security and foreign installations, especially in the country's capital Kabul, members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire. At least 50 people were injured earlier this week, when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament at an inter-district competition in Yahyakahil, Paktika province. The attacks have prompted Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the country's defense forces. He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids, banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered a top-to-bottom inspection of his country's military forces after a rise in Taliban attacks . Ghani is considering whether night raids, barred by his predecessor Hamid Karzai, should be reintroduced . The latest attacks come as it was revealed US President Barack Obama signed a 'secret' order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal. The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed. Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years. Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the US and NATO allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country. The international combat mission in Afghanistan, which began after the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban, was due to conclude at the end of this year .","Reza Gul looked on as the militants attacked her son's police checkpoint .

"A couple who originally adopted two brothers have now taken on six more of their siblings to create a family of eight. Melissa and Scott Groves, from Omaha, Nebraska, are parents to eight brothers ranging from a young teen to a baby. Melissa, who became pregnant when she was 17, already had a four-year-old daughter Autumn when she met Scott. A couple who originally adopted two brothers have now taken on six more of their siblings to create a family of eight. Pictured: Melissa's biological daughter Autumn, 17, and her eight adopted brothers Noah, Chase, Garrett, Hayden, Ashton, Curran, Bryer and Zayn . After a whirlwind romance he proposed six months after their first date and they were married a year later. They were both to keen expand their family, but they discovered conceiving naturally was very unlikely. The couple decided to become foster parents in December 2003 after Melissa visited her aunt who was a foster carer and was inspired by her story. Melissa and Scott Groves, from Omaha, Nebraska, are now parents to eight brothers ranging from young teens to a baby. Pictured: The couple with their newest addition Zayn . They enrolled in foster parent training for ten weeks, although Melissa admits they 'wondered if all the red tape and hoops were worth it or if we’d ever get through the classes as the weeks seemed to drag.' But the couple eventually qualified and were awarded their license - a few weeks later received their first case. They were told there was a sibling group of five and two of the younger boys needed emergency care. Melissa admit they panicked about the idea of two young charges, but agreed to take Noah, three and his brother Chase, 22 months. 'Almost instantaneously these two seem to capture our hearts, and it wasn’t very long before I knew that if the chance arose I wanted to have them in our lives forever. Perhaps it was fate, perhaps it was divine intervention, I don’t know, but what I do know was that the boys’ ‘short’ stay with us turned into adoption,' she says. The family line up to celebrate Zayn's adoption being officially recognized. Melissa says Zayn is just over a year now and he teaches 'us patience and unconditional love daily and I can’t imagine life without him' The couple continued to provide foster care, although they did feel the need to adopt any more children. But within weeks of the legal adoption going through for Chase and Noah they received a phone call from their previous case worker informing them the pair had a new brother with an immediate need for a foster placement upon his birth. 'There was no question, how could I deny my sons and this new child the possibility of being together? So after less than a year, our family grew yet again with the addition of Baby Garrett,' says Melissa. 'Then, just eleven months later we were surprised with another call concerning the arrival of another newborn brother, Hayden. 'Born with a cleft lip, drug exposed, and premature, this little guy had a rough road ahead, but he was as much ours as our other boys; of course we’d accept. And on National Adoption Day they officially became a part of our family!' Melissa admits at this stage people began to question her judgement, but she enjoyed her expanding family and getting to know her new sons. Which is why the couple also adopted two more of the brothers - Ashton joined at four-month-old and they then took on newborn Curran in May 2009. The family got into their stride and Melissa says life was going well as the boys became accustomed to their new home. But then she received a Facebook message from the boys’ birth mom asking if they would consider adopting her unborn baby. 'We had every reason to say no—not enough money, not enough time, etc. but somehow things seemed to fall into place and the following June we found ourselves in a hospital waiting room awaiting the arrival of our son, Bryer,' she says. 'In October 2013 our soon-to-be seventh son, Zayn, was born premature, drug exposed, and diagnosed with Down syndrome.' Melissa says Zayn is just over a year now and he teaches 'us patience and unconditional love daily and I can’t imagine life without him.' The family have now officially adopted him and Melissa says: 'For us, adoption was initially just a means to complete our family when having a biological child seemed impossible. But, it has become so much more to us. It has opened our eyes, widened the horizons of our family, enriched all of our lives, and brought us so much love and happiness.'","Melissa and Scott Groves are now parents to eight brothers ranging from young teens to a baby .

"Eight people have been arrested as part of an investigation into child sexual exploitation. Six men and a 16-year-old boy were arrested in raids in Rochdale and Oldham this morning and are now being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to commit sexual acts with a child. A seventh man was arrested later and is also being questioned. The investigation was set up because police were trying to establish why teenagers aged between 13 and 15 in the area were going missing from home, when one suggested she was being groomed. Eight people have been arrested in early raids in Rochdale (pictured) and Oldham and are being questioned by police on suspicion of conspiracy to commit sexual acts with a child, one of the eight is a 16-year-old boy . The operation was launched in the wake of the Rochdale child sex grooming gang scandal, where vulnerable girls were exploited by a gang of nine men who plied them with drink before passing them around for sex. The case led to an increased awareness of sexual exploitation and the need to protect children from becoming victims in the area. Early morning raids today led to arrests of the seven, who are aged between 16 and 47. The raids were led by Sunrise, a dedicated sexual exploitation police team in Rochdale. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Aston said: 'The Sunrise team were initially looking at reasons why the children - two girls aged 15 and 13 and a 13-year-old boy - were going missing from home. Officers spoke to one of the girls who suggested they were being groomed between 16 September and 17 October 2014. 'A swift investigation was launched and agencies worked together which has resulted in these arrests across the Rochdale and Oldham areas plus the safeguarding of three vulnerable children.' Paul Marshall, assistant director for children's social care at Rochdale Council said the raids were part of work being done in the area to tackle child sexual exploitation. He said: 'The success of Operation Infrared means that three vulnerable children are now safe and seven people have been arrested as part of this investigation.' Last month police investigating sex grooming of children arrested 11 people suspected of abusing a group of seven school-aged girls.The suspects - nine men and two women aged 19 to 38 - were held on supsicion of offences including rape, and inciting a child into prostitution during raids on six properties. This was also part of the wider campaign to tackle child sexual exploitation. A report into the child sex ring in Rotherham and Oldham, run by the nine-strong gang and exposed last year, found the girls were let down by all 17 agencies that were meant to protect them. The report criticised social workers, police and the Crown Prosecution Service for failing to work together to tackle the grooming which led to dozens of vulnerable girls being abused by the gang.

"A woman who accidentally flushed her diamond ring down the toilet has described her surprise after sewer workers returned it to her the following day.

I wanted to dive down that toilet right after it,' Ms Hanson told Medford Mail Tribune. Family heirloom: Pat Hanson was stunned when sewer workers returned a diamond ring that she had accidentally flushed down the toilet a day previously . Ms Hanson says the ring dates to 1920. Her mother died in 1989, and she's been wearing it daily since then. Since the day she lost the ring was a Sunday, she says there was little she could do but pray. The next morning she and a friend went to the regional sewer utility. Despite the sewer workers' best efforts, they were unable to find the ring and had to break the bad news to Ms Hanson. But the next day, without telling her, they went back to work. 'We didn't want to get her hopes up,' operations manager Shane Macuk said. They spent hours trying to find Ms Hanson's ring. Finally, after hours looking, worker Travis Cox spotted the ring and the crew managed to get it out. With the ring cleaned up, repaired and resized, Hanson is praising the sewer workers and crediting the patron saint of lost items. 'I'd done a lot of praying to St. Anthony,' she said. 'I feel I ought to write a letter to the Pope and let him know we had a miracle here in Central Point.'","Pat Hanson says the ring was her mother's and has been a keepsake since her death in 1989 .

"Showing a man screaming for his life as he is buried alive at gunpoint, this could be the most shocking video yet to emerge from Syria. While it is impossible to independently verify whether this short one-minute clip is genuine, it is still both powerful and disturbing - a sick reminder of a brutal civil battle for supremacy the West appears powerless to prevent. Propoganda or not, a man is seen buried up to his neck and surrounded by a handful of soldiers allegedly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime. Scroll down for video (WARNING: Disturbing content) Buried: The clip posted on YouTube shows a man buried up to his chin, with his head covered with a scarf, allegedly in Syria . As the unit's commanding officer approaches, subtitles say: 'Yes sir, we placed him in there as you have ordered.' The officer asks: 'What's he got? Did you find anything with this damn animal?' The helpless man, described as being from Al-Qussair, a rebel city in western Syria near Homs, is then accused of carrying a camera to capture footage Assad's forces to send to television networks. He is called an 'animal' several times and a 'dog' before the order is given to bury him. The surrounding soldiers then shovel dirt over his head as the man cries 'I bear witness that there is no god by Allah'. As his head disappears from view under the ground, the soldiers taunt him saying: 'Say that there's no god but Bashar you animal.' Soldiers, allegedly loyal to President Assad's regime, surround the man as he is trapped in the ground . Disturbing: The soldiers then pile on dirt with a shovel, covering the man's head . None of the soldiers' faces are visible in the video and it is not clear who obtained it or how before the footage was posted on YouTube. It is just the latest disturbing clip to emerge allegedly depicting atrocities in Syria since the rebellion began more than a year ago. Earlier this month footage was released allegedly showing Syrian troops beating an anti-government rebel in the . suburbs of the country's capital, Damascus. The mobile video, which came to light on April 8, has not yet been verified. Seconds later the man's head is completely obscured, suggesting he has been buried alive . It . shows a man lying face down on a dusty floor, his hands behind his back . as three others - two of them wearing fatigues -  stand on his neck and . back, kicking him and hitting him with a small club. Meanwhile, dissidents have claimed a massive explosion has killed 70 people in Hama. They said several houses in the Masha at-Tayyar district in southern Hama were destroyed by a big explosion. However, Syria's state news agency has said the blast was caused by anti-regime bomb-makers mishandling explosives and killed at least 16 people. The . Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it is not sure what set off . Wednesday's explosion and asked U.N. monitors to investigate. Grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube allegedly showing people searching for survivors under the rubble of collapsed homes in Hama . The homes were allegedly destroyed when a rocket fell during shelling by Syrian government forces . Following the attack UN envoy Kofi Annan voiced alarm about persistent violence in Syria . The . Observatory had initially cited witnesses as saying the blast on Hama's . outskirts was caused by government shelling. Another activist group, . the Local Coordination Committees, also blamed the regime and said . dozens were killed. Amateur . video posted online showed a ball of fire and smoke rising from the . neighborhood and residents searching the rubble. The Observatory said . Thursday that at least 16 were killed. Syria's infrastructure has been significantly damaged in more than a year of conflict, water and electricity supplies have been disrupted and many families cannot meet their basic daily needs, a United Nations mission has found. A confidential U.N. plan for responding to humanitarian needs, based on a joint assessment carried out with Syrian officials from March 18-26, was obtained by Reuters on Thursday. The United Nations is preparing a major aid operation and its 'Syria Response Plan' forms the basis of a $180 million appeal presented to donor countries last Friday at closed-door talks in Geneva. More than 9,000 people have been killed in the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, who is under international pressure to honour a U.N.-backed ceasefire that went into force on April 12. On Thursday, Syria blamed 'terrorist' bomb makers for an explosion that damaged a building and killed 16 people in the city of Hama, where hostility to Assad runs deep. At least one million Syrians need humanitarian aid in the 10 provinces the U.N. team visited, most of which reported shortages of essential medicines and sharp rises in food prices, it said. 'Jobs and livelihoods have been disrupted, the cost of ... goods has risen and many can no longer meet their basic daily needs or access essential social services due to insecurity and financial strain,' the document said. Dissidents also said Syrian security forces shot dead four civilians on a bus in the northern province of Idlib on Wednesday, as international pressure built on Damascus to honour U.N.-backed ceasefire pledges to order soldiers and tanks back to barracks. In the latest violence to undermine the flaky 13-day-old truce, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the four were killed at a checkpoint on the main road from Aleppo to the capital. It said an elderly man was killed in heavy fighting in the southern city of Deraa, crucible of the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad that flared after Arab uprisings elsewhere. A woman who visited Douma on Tuesday night said the largely anti-Assad town east of the capital had been under constant shelling and was without water, power or mobile phone signal. There was no mention of the bus shooting or bombardment in Syria's rigidly controlled media or comment from the authorities in Damascus, which has barred most foreign journalists since the revolt started more than 13 months ago. The International Committee of the Red Cross also revealed today that a Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer was shot dead and three others were wounded in the town of Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus. 'We are saddened and extremely shocked by the death of Mohammed al-Khadraa,' Dr Abdul Rahman al-Attar, the president of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, said in a statement. 'This is the third fatal incident involving the Red Crescent in less than eight months.' Mr Khadraa was shot and killed on Tuesday in a vehicle clearly marked with the Red Crescent emblem, the statement said. Syria's state news agency said an armed terrorist group killed Khadraa when it opened fire on a Red Crescent ambulance, but did not give details on the group. Opposition activists said that government forces have been shelling Douma with mortar bombs for a week.

"Millions of London homes rose in value by more than the average salary of a nurse or a teacher in the city last year. In 20 out of 33 boroughs, a typical house earned £38,000, compared to a London nurse on £35,300 and a secondary school teacher on £37,800. In a third of boroughs in the capital, houses even earned more than a typical solicitor on £70,000. And in two of London’s most exclusive areas – Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster – prices shot up by more than David Cameron’s salary of £142,000. Big earner: House owners in Kensington and Chelsea earned and average of £142,000 last year, more than David Cameron's salary, thanks to rising property prices (file image) The average price rise across the capital was £57,000 in the 12 months to April – far higher than what many residents earn. The National Housing Federation, which campaigns for affordable housing and analysed the latest Land Registry and Office for National Statistics data, said the figures showed a ‘chronic shortage of affordable homes’, which is driving up prices beyond the reach of earners. David Orr, of the federation, said: ‘It’s no secret that house prices are way beyond the reach of pay packets of hard-working Londoners, but these figures show just how absurd and unfair the housing crisis has become. ‘The housing market is clearly broken when house prices are rising by amounts larger than the entire salary of a nurse, teacher or firefighter. What chance have our core workers got of ever owning a home in London?’ Mr Orr said only Londoners earning more than £100,000 could comfortably afford a home in the city. He called for the Government to come up with a long-term plan to end London’s housing crisis ‘within a generation’. ‘The fact that even well-paid professionals in the city can’t afford to buy a home and in many cases even struggle to pay their rent should send alarm bells ringing,’ Mr Orr added. ‘And this isn’t a matter of choice in where you live. ‘We need nurses, teachers, firefighters and plumbers in every city. Therefore we need to build homes that they can afford.’ Nick Taylor, 26, a staff nurse in south London, told the federation: ‘I love working and living in London but I’ve resigned myself to the fact that I will never be able to afford a home here that I could afford elsewhere in the country.’ A third of boroughs saw rises of £70,000, more than the average salary for a solicitor, while the average for the whole capital was £38,000 - compared to a nurse earning just £35,300 . The average property in London rose in value by 18 per cent in the last 12 months and now costs £460,000. According to the Land Registry, this is two and a half times more than the national average of £177,000 – which increased by just 2.9 per cent in a year. Struggling first-time buyers get an average of £18,505 from ‘the bank of mum and dad’, according to property experts Slater & Gordon. But one in seven parents who help their children on to the property ladder are now in debt. More than three quarters of 500 parents polled dipped into their savings and some were forced to remortgage their own homes or downsize. Many said they were now anxious about their own financial situation – but just 6 per cent regretted lending the money.","Twenty of 33 boroughs  saw rise of £38,000 while a nurse earns £35,300 .

"A foster carer has claimed her husband was killed by the stress of a 'botched' £120,000 council extension to their home. John Gibbins suffered a heart attack and died at just 52 after battling with the local authority for 17 months to sort out the problems. The project - built to help house their six foster children - allegedly left water streaming down the walls, a flooded cellar and a damp kitchen after being built in 2013. Foster carer Sue Gibbins pictured with her husband, John, in their home before work on the extension started . 'The stress of the whole situation was too much for him,' said Sue Gibbins, of Llanarth in Ceredigion, Wales . 'He was extremely upset, and knew as a builder what they were doing wrong. 'He was very upset about the whole thing; we just wanted more space for the foster kids. 'One day, after months of getting nowhere with the council, he just went and sat down in the front room. 'When I went in, he was dead.He had suffered a massive heart attack.' Mr Gibbins died in June this year. The couple, who had looked after the six children aged seven to 18 since 2006, had to wait over two years after plans were approved for work to even start on the extension. 'What was supposed to be a help to our family, turned out to be the worst situation imaginable,' added 54-year-old Sue. 'We were just trying to do our best for the foster kids and Ceredigion Council offered the extension and at the time we were glad. We had no idea it would end up like this.' The extension, which provided three bedrooms and two bathrooms, has still not been fixed despite repeat promises. Sue Gibbins shows the damp coming through the roof of the extension built to provide an additional three bedrooms and two bathrooms . Water flooded the extension at the home in Llanarth in Ceredigion, Wales . Mrs Gibbins claimed the extension carried out by Ceredigion County Council has still not been fixed . 'I am getting nowhere with the council,' she said. 'People come round and disappear, but we have heard nothing. 'It has dragged on for 17 months and it needs to be sorted for the sake of my family.' Back in November 2012 Mr Gibbins, who was a builder by trade, said  that the extension was causing 'a lot of stress'. 'There's a lot of stress that's been put on the family,' he said. 'My wife has been crying her eyes out and there's no need for it. It's breaking us all up.' A spokesman for Ceredigion County Council said today: 'The Council has been involved in this large scheme which involved the construction of an extension to the property. 'The majority of this scheme has been satisfactorily completed, although it is acknowledged that as there are inherent difficulties with carrying out works to old properties, a snagging list of additional works has been identified and agreed. 'We are currently liaising with the client to agree a convenient and appropriate time for these works to be completed. 'We were saddened to hear of the client’s family loss.'

"Stuart Kerner, 44,  has been accused of having a sexual relationship with a former pupil, but today said the girl had invented the story . An R.E. teacher accused of having an 18-month affair with a former pupil  today told a court that the alleged victim is a 'vain stalker' who made the relationship up. Stuart Kerner, 44, the married vice principal of Bexleyheath Academy, is accused of having a sexual relationship with a former pupil. But today jurors at his trial were told the girl, now aged 19, is a 'psychopathic liar' who  thought 'everyone fancies her.' The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, claims that during her relationship with Kerner, which began when she was 15, the pair had sex 'all over' the school. She told jurors that Kerner took her virginity in one of the store cupboards, and claimed he had once taken her for a day-long sex session at his home while his wife at work. But at the Inner London Crown Court today, Kerner argued that the girl had stalked him, and used details gleaned from calendars, computers and gadgets in his office to construct her fantasy. Kerner's defence barrister Edward Ellis  said: 'He's a man who didn't look behind his back, and he was stalked, and information was found out about him for this carefully constructed elaborate ruse. 'Why? We don't know, it's not up to the defence to prove.' Marion King, a librarian at the school, also gave evidence to support Kerner's account, calling the girl a liar, and saying that she used to take Kerner's iPad to play games on. In court today Kerner also denied buying a Fifty Shades of Grey keychain - based on the erotic novel - for the female student, saying it was a 'joke present for his wife instead. He also denied carrying condoms in his suit jacket at the school, saying his wife would have noticed as she often hung up his jacket and removed things from the pockets. The court had previously heard that the girl had  lied about being in a car accident to skip school. Mr Ellis added: 'This particular lie, of the accident, was so elaborate it fooled people for weeks, even her friends didn't know about it, even her mum didn't know about it. 'It's not pleasant to talk about [the girl] in terms of being a liar, but the issue really is a credibility point.' The alleged victim, who cannot be identified, said Kerner took her virginity in school cupboard when she was 16, after which they had sex 'all over' Bexleyheath Academy where he was vice principal . The girl claims that her relationship with Kerner began when she was 15-years-old after they became close, spending time in the school library where she had volunteered since Year 9. According to prosecutors the girl's intimate knowledge of Kerner's private life, including birthdays and the fact he always wore a crucifix under his work attire, point to th truth of her claims. However defence barristers argue that the crucifix detail came from a photo of the teacher and his son kept in his office. The girl also claimed that, after seeing the teacher undressed, she noticed a scar on his back. However, it was argued he told her about the scar when he gave her sympathy following her false claims that she had been injured in a car crash. In an interview with police the girl claimed the pair slept with each other in the same week that his wife, Katy, suffered a miscarriage in late 2012. Mr Ellis said his client knew nothing of the allegations against him until the police interviewed him. He said: 'The police went through all the allegations with him, and of course how can you answer something you know nothing about. He has nothing to hide, nothing at all.' The jury heard Kerner was born in South London and was bought up 'not far' from Inner London Crown Court, went to King's College London to study a course in divinity and theology and had considered being ordained. Kerner also denied buying a Fifty Shades of Grey keychain for the girl, saying instead the he had bought it as a 'joke' present for his wife Katy (pictured right) Mr Ellis said; 'He was going to be ordained, but he didn't take it, and went into teaching.' Kerner has told of how he met the girl while taking a statement from her in the school library over accusations that her mother had been assaulting her. He told the court that he had taken a statement from the girl on behalf of the child protection officer at the school, but that was his 'last involvement' in that situation. He denies two counts of sexual activity with a child and six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. The trial continues.

"A dominatrix who chained, gagged and whipped her clients has applied for planning permission to allow her sex fetish club to remain open. Lorraine White has submitted a retrospective planning application asking for permission to change her warehouse on an industrial estate in Reddish to a place of 'photography and mild fetish play'. She had been using the unit already without permission but has submitted an application after Stockport Council received a complaint about the dungeon, which she wants to remain open from 11pm to 7am from Tuesday to Saturday. Lorraine White works as a dominatrix and applied for retrospective planning permission to change the use of her warehouse on a Reddish industrial estateto a sex fetish club where clients are restrained and humiliated . People living near to the Vauxhall Industrial Estate dungeon where Miss White restrains and humiliates men for their pleasure said they do not object to it as long as the business remains discreet. A website for Miss White's club has the warning: 'This site contains content pertaining to consensual sadomasochistic activity which some people may find offensive.' Miss White also refers to herself as a 'Manchester mistress' and 'sensual sadist.' Among her 'specialities' she lists bondage, psychodrama, sensory deprivation and humiliation. The fetish club was discovered in 2012 when firemen were unable to get into the building after it caught fire because of all the locked doors. Miss White, who is known as Princess Lucina, was fined £8,000 for breaching health and safety laws at the time . Firemen finally gained access and found a trove of handcuffs, chains and other restraining devices in the basement. They also discovered several canisters of nitrous oxide and laughing gas - also know as 'hippie crack' - which White’s clients used. At the hearing at Stockport Magistrates Court Miss White said men were generally restrained or gagged in the dungeon, but nothing was too severe. At the time she said: 'It involved a lot of humiliation, doing domestic work and dressingup in women’s clothes.' The club in Vauxhall Industrial Estate has a collection of handcuffs, chains and other restraining devices . White has previously been fined for breaching health and safety laws after firefighters were unable to get in . Jason Morris, 44, who lives nearby in Greg Street, said he wouldn't object to the change of use planning application. He said: 'I don't care as long as everyone is consenting. 'I wouldn't have known it was there (but for press coverage), as long as it stays that way I'm not bothered.' Miss White has made a retrospective planning application to change the use of the warehouse to sex dungeon . Miss White wants to open the sex dungeon from 7pm to 11am, but it will close on Sundays and Bank Holidays . Jacqui Wood, from Arc arts group, based in the same building on the industrial estate, said: 'If it's legal and the landlord is OK with it then that's their business.' Miss White, of Salford, submitted the retrospective application after the council received a complaint about the change of use. A council spokesman said: 'The council is satisfied the unit is currently being used for purposes connected to the adult entertainment industry. 'Should the application be refused then the matter will be reviewed again and the council will decide on the appropriate next course of action.' A dominatrix - or 'dom' - isn't a prostitute, but a female who feeds men's appetites to be controlled by a strong woman. Some dominatrixes don't even let their clients touch them.Their trade revolves around BDSM, or bondage, dominance and sado-masochism, with clients paying to be chained-up, whipped and gagged. It's an activity that famously takes place in bestseller Fifty Shades Of Grey. The upcoming movie based on the bestseller stars British actor Jamie Dornan (pictured above with Amelia Warner) as the BDSM-obsessed Christian Grey. A dominatrix will usually wear black and red, tightly fitting clothes made from leather or rubber latex - and high heels. Some might wear a corset to ensure their torso remains in shape. Dominatrixes sometimes let clients use nitrous oxide, sometimes called laughing gas or hippie crack', to attain a feeling of elation. According to talktofrank.com, nitrous oxide has 'several legitimate uses, but when inhaled can make people feel euphoric and relaxed' with some people experiencing hallucinations. It warns that there is a risk of death 'as a lack of oxygen can occur' with the risk increased if the gas 'is consumed in an enclosed space'. The dominatrix trade is legal in Britain - with practitioners only likely to fall foul of the law if they cause clients lasting injuries or marks.","Lorraine White runs a sex fetish club in a warehouse in Reddish, Stockport .

"Defence: Vicky Pryce, who was jailed for taking her ex-husband Chris Huhne's speeding points, has accused people of 'ganging up' on Ched Evans . Vicky Pryce, who was jailed for taking ex-husband Chris Huhne's speeding points, has been jeered after she said people were  unfairly 'ganging up' on rapist football Ched Evans. The economist told a charity event last night she was 'astonished by the attacks' on Evans  because 'none of us know exactly what happened'. The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years after a jury unanimously agreed he raped a drunk woman in a Rhyl hotel while his friends filmed it. Evans was released after serving half his sentence but is struggling to find a new club because of the furore over his crime and his lack of contrition. Speaking at a debate titled Are Celebrities Above the Law? in central London yesterday, Ms Pryce, who herself was jailed for eight months, said he has 'done his time' so can 'live his life'. She said: 'Why is football so emotional? Criminals return to the House of Lords. It just sends out the message that you can never be rehabilitated. I have been astonished by the attacks on him in the press. People are ganging up on him.' The Evening Standard described how the crowd at the event for Jewish charity Norwood, aped a football crowd as Pryce was heckled as she spoke. 'He should be able to live a life. None of us know exactly what happened. He’s done the time, we should be much more open to rehabilitation'. Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated. New life: The former professional's fiancee Natasha Massey has said 'all he wanted to do' was return to his career and Vicky Pryce says he had 'served his time' so should be able to start again . Scandal: Pryce took Chris Huhne's points and kept it secret until he had an affair with his PA and she decided to 'nail him', her trial heard . After failing to take a public stance for days, the club revealed Evans would be allowed to train with former teammates but did not invite him to return permanently. Career: The striker, pictured on Monday, who used to play for Sheffield United, had his invitation to train at the club revoked . Their invitation was revoked this week after mass public outcry.  In a statement, the club said the public reaction to their actions could not have been 'anticipated'. Ms Pryce was herself jailed in March 2013 for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points from her ex-husband to stop him losing his licence. Her trial heard she only revealed she had taken them to exact revenge on her cheating husband and 'nail him' after he left her for another woman. Former Energy Secretary Huhne was clocked driving too fast in March 2003 and persuaded Pryce to take the blame so he could avoid losing his licence. The couple separated after 26 years of marriage in 2010 after Mr Huhne admitted he was having an affair with his PR adviser Carina Trimingham, 46. After nearly two years proclaiming his innocence and fighting to have the case dropped, Huhne changed his plea at the start of the pair's trial at Southwark Crown Court, promptly resigning as Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh and ending his political career. Ms Pryce – who started her sentence in Holloway, Britain’s toughest women’s jail – was inspired by her experiences to write a book about how and why women end up in prison – and to express her concerns about the way they are treated there. She embraced prison life, taking part in karaoke – and playing bingo for the first time, before being released on a tag. Pryce has since been dating former Labour MP Denis MacShane, who was jailed for six months for fiddling his expenses. Ched Evans' loyal fiancee Natasha Massey has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned. Outrage: Jessica Ennis-Hill (left) vowed to have her name removed from one of Sheffield United's stands and Charlie Webster (right) resigned her patronage over the issue . Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. Her future husband raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted Evans on the way there saying: 'I've got a bird'. McDonald had sex with the victim, before Evans arrived and raped her, as two others filmed it through the window. Two years ago the victim had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012, but now may have to do the same again. The young woman was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’. Police put her ‘relocation package’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet. Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’. May 30, 2011: CCTV shows footballer Clayton McDonald meeting victim outside a kebab shop in Rhyl at around 4am, before taking a cab with her to a nearby Premier Inn. On the way he texts friend Ched Evans to say he's 'got a bird'. Mr McDonald and Evans both had intercourse with the girl, and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window. After waking up in the hotel room with no memory of the incident, the victim went to police, and later the same day Evans and Mr McDonald are both arrested. July 26, 2011:  Evans and Mr McDonald are charged with rape, which they both deny. April 11, 2012: Evans and Mr McDonald take the stand for the first time at Caernarfon Crown Court. April 20: Mr McDonald is acquitted of rape, while Evans is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. During the trial Evans told the court that he had gone to the hotel after getting a text from Mr McDonald, and let himself into the room where he found the pair having sex. He claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself, while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it. April 23: The victim is named for the first time online by supporters of Evans, who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to 'virtual GBH'. Officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her away from her home - protection usually reserved for high-profile murderers released from jail. August: Evans has request to appeal his conviction turned down, though this is later overturned by the Court of Appeal in London. November, 2013: Evans continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name. October 17, 2014: He is released from jail after serving half of his sentence and returns home to Rhyl where a bouncy castle is pictured being delivered to his parents' house, but is later taken away. October 18: Reports surface that Evans has been offered a £500,000 contract to re-sign for Sheffield United, though the club later deny the rumours. November 11: After a request from the Professional Footballers' Association, Sheffield United agree to allow Evans to return to the club to train, but refuse to say whether he will be signed. The same day patron Charlie Webster, who was abused as a child, walks away from the club. November 12: Lindsay Graham, another club patron, cuts her ties with the club along with another unnamed patron as 150,000 sign petition saying Evans should not be allowed to play again. November 13: Jessica Ennis-Hill asks for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, leading to abuse on Twitter. November 17: Karl Massey, the millionaire father of Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, says he will offer the former-footballer a job at one of his firms if the club will not have him back . November 20: Sheffield United confirm that they have withdrawn the offer to allow Evans to train at their ground. November 22:  The Ministry of Justice said while it cannot comment on individual prisoners, in general terms the terms of a sex offender's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad, scuppering any hopes that Evans may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence.","Pryce  jailed for taking her ex-husband Chris Huhne's speeding points .

"Animal rights activists are calling for a change to the law that allows people in Switzerland to roast their pet cats and dogs and serve the meat up on the dinner table. SOS Cats animal charity insists that the 'barbaric' and 'outdated tradition', which it believes is secretly adopted by up to three per cent of the population, simply has to stop. Roasted cat appears on traditional Christmas menus across certain areas of Switzerland, cooked with white wine and garlic in a similar way to rabbit. Scroll down for video . Although human consumption of dog meat is mostly associated with Asian countries such as China, (pictured) Swiss farmers also eat the animals . 'We especially see it in the regions of Lucerne, Appenzell, Jura and in the canton of Bern,' Tomi Tomek, founder of SOS Cats in Neuenburg, told the BBC. Dog meat on the other hand goes mostly into making sausages and in some rural regions it is considered to be a fatty remedy for rheumatism. Farmers in the areas of Appenzell and St Gallen  are said to be particularly fond of dog meat, with a breed related to the beefy Rottweiler thought to be a favorite for the dinner table. One farmer from the Rhine Valley told local media: 'Meat is meat. There's nothing odd about it. Construction workers in particular like eating it.' A loophole in Swiss law means that pet cats and dogs are not directly included in Swiss farming and agricultural welfare regulations. Animal rights activists are calling for a change to the law that allows people in Switzerland to roast their pet cats and dogs and serve the meat up on the dinner table . Food Safety and Veterinary Authority spokeswoman Eva van Bek told the Daily Star: 'They must not be sold as a food item, they cannot be donated or offered for sale, but it is true that under current Swiss law owners cannot be prevented from eating their own pets.' Around 16,000 people, including the life-long animal rights activist and campaigner Brigitte Bardot, have signed a petition that has been handed to the Swiss parliament, calling for the government to stop people eating 'domestic animals'. Mr Tomek said: 'No-one in Switzerland is now so starving they have to eat their pet. 'If we have to use the courts to stop this case by case we will. 'These animals form part of a family, they must not end up on a dinner plate. 'I am seeking a parliamentarian who will table my petition - and I will find one.'

"British taxpayers are forking out £13.5million a year to pay for EU subsidies for bullfighting in Spain, it has been revealed. Spanish farmers receive the handouts for breeding the animals killed in the controversial sport as part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Politicians are calling for Prime Minister David Cameron to refuse to make the payments immediately. It has been revealed that British taxpayers are forking out £13.5million a year to pay for EU subsidies for bullfighting in Spain, it has been revealed - pictured is Spanish apprentice bullfighter Gomez del Pilar . Labour’s Sir Alan Meale has tabled a Commons motion that says: ‘Bullfighting for fiestas is abhorrent as it involves the torture of animals in public display.’ The MP for Mansfield said it was ‘bizarre’ the Government is even contemplating paying for this and said ‘bullfighting is the last thing in the world we should be subsidising’. He said the practice flies in the face of Britain’s own Animal Welfare Act 2006 and of the European Convention on animals kept for farming purposes, which specifically states that animals should not suffer pain, injury or distress. ‘Such financial allocations are a clear violation of these laws.’ The motion ‘calls on the Government to immediately cease such payments forthwith’. Politicians are calling for Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) to refuse to make the payments immediately . The EU allocates £110million of CAP money each year to Spanish farmers who use their pastures to rear fighting bulls. An EU report claimed the subsidy kept the practice going and said: ‘Without such backing bullfighting would probably be on the brink of financial collapse.’ Animal Aid director Andrew Tyler said: ‘The idea that taxpayers across Europe are subsidising bullfighting is deeply offensive and Animal Aid certainly backs any political moves to put paid to this disgusting scheme.’ Ralph Cook of the Wales Alliance Against Cruel Sports said: ‘If the Government wants to save money with the support of the British people they could save that proportion of our money that would go towards rearing bulls for bullfighting. ‘They would probably get a pat on the back from most of the British public.’ The Common Agricultural Policy subsidises farmers across the EU’s 28 member states. Critics have argued it is outdated and called for it to be axed. Margaret Thatcher famously won Britain’s rebate because a significant proportion of the EU’s budget is spent of agricultural subsidies and the UK has a relatively small farming sector.","EU allocates £110 million each year to farmers who rear fighting bulls .

"A Florida man who bought a home at auction got a gruesome surprise when he went to look over the property on Tuesday and found a corpse on the bedroom floor. Cape Coral, Florida police are now conducting a death investigation at the home, where neighbors say they haven't seen or heard from the last resident in years. New owner William Wilson bought the home on SE 19th Lane for $96,000 and went over to the home earlier this week to mow the lawn and trim the hedges when he found the body next to the master bedroom bed. Scroll down for 911 call . What happened? William Wilson bought this Cape Coral, Florida home for $96,000. He went over to the house on Tuesday to mow the lawn and trim the hedges, and ended up finding a dead body in the master bedroom . 'You couldn’t tell who it was,' Mr Wilson told the News-Press. 'You couldn’t tell if it was a male or a female ... it’s disappointing and a sad thing that nobody cared enough to check.' He said the house was a cluttered mess, like someone was in the process of moving and that there were pictures of children on the fridge. There was also a bird cage and a pile of feces on the living room floor. The most recent piece of mail was from November 2011 and the property taxes hadn't been paid for the past three years. Neighbors say the home was last occupied by an older woman from Miami who lived with her sister. According to public records, the home was previously owned by a Carmen Garcia-Viso. They thought she had moved or disappeared since they hadn't seen her in years. Neighbor Gary Oben Jr, 30, said the woman was nice although she was reclusive and didn't speak much English. He says he only ever saw her when she went to get the mail or watered the lawn. 'I had a hunch,' Mr Oben said. 'Either it was a grow house or there was a dead lady in there.' Who is she?

Personal trainer and author of the Fat Burn Revolution Julia Buckley told MailOnline that it's 'a good solid session on the whole.' She said: 'Miranda has chosen some nice, effective moves for the legs like squats and lunges and great core exercises like plank and leg raises. Mountain climbers are a brilliant cardio move, those are great for torching fat. 'To make it more of a full body routine, I’d have liked to see a bit more balance and a couple more exercises for the arms, back and shoulders as it’s very core and lower body focused. But it’s not a bad workout at all.' Even though it's only 15 minutes long, Julia said Miranda's moves can give the body a decent work out but she recommends people try to exercise for longer more regularly and then do the shorter routine when they are pushed for time. She said: 'I'm all for short, sharp sessions, but there's a limit to how fit you can get on just 15 minutes training per day, so I'd recommend longer sessions for most people, most of the time. 'However, something like this could slip nicely into a schedule for days when time is time and you want a kit-free workout.' 1 minute of push ups . 1 minute plank (or 2 x 30 second holds for beginners) 1 minute of squats . 1 minute of jumping jacks . 1 minute of left leg raises . 1 minute of bicycle crunches . 1 minute of right leg raises . 1 minute bridge (hold 30 seconds, pulse 30 seconds) 1 minute of jumping jacks . 1 minute of alternating lunges . 1 minute wall sit . 1 minute of mountain climbers . 1 minute of jumping jacks . Take 30 seconds recovery between each move . MIRANDA'S MOVES EXPLAINED... PUSH UPS: Aka press ups this is a move that has never gone out of fashion. Julia explains why: 'Press ups are an awesome all-body move, again you're bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles to maintain a straight position, which is great for shredding the belly and at the same time you're sculpting the chest and arms.' To do it, start lying flat face down, position your palms face down under your shoulders and then push up so your body is balanced on your hands and toes and your back is straight. Slowly lower and repeat. Julia said: 'A minute of push ups would be pretty challenging for most beginners, but you could do them with your knees on the floor instead of your feet if full push ups are too much.' THE PLANK: This move engages your core muscles leading to a tighter, flatter stomach. Julia explains: 'The plank is one of the best exercises for tightening the tummy because it works the whole midsection of your body, including the deep abdominal muscles. It is also great for improving posture and balance and will build core strength to help you perform better many other exercises.' Begin by lying flat face down. Position your arms under your shoulders and then rise up onto your forearms so your body is balanced on your forearms and toes and your back is straight. Hold this position for a minute - be warned it isn't easy and you may start to wobble! Hold for 30 seconds to begin with if you are finding it too difficult. SQUATS: Julia said: 'Squats are among the best exercises you can do to firm up and sculpt the legs and bum and they also work the core and back muscles.' Begin from a standing position and then lower your body, bending your knees as if going to sit down in a chair, when your legs reach a right angle to the floor, push back up to standing and repeat. JUMPING JACKS: From standing, do a star jump splitting your legs apart and then jumping back to bring them together. At the same time, raise your arms up and apart. Lunges, left, tone the legs and bottom while press ups, right, are an effective all body exercise . LEG RAISES: Made famous by Jane Fonda, these are great for toning the thighs. Start lying on your side and raise one leg up and back down again. BICYCLE CRUNCHES: These are a different version of sit ups designed to strengthen the stomach muscles. Lie flat on your back and raise your legs off the floor with your knees bent. Position your arms so your palms are resting behind your ears. Then bring each leg in towards your stomach in turn and at the same time, raise your upper body, engaging your stomach muscles to pull you up. As you raise, slightly twist to one side so one elbow meets the opposite knee being pulled towards the body. BRIDGE: This is another move which will give you a flat stomach and a firm bottom. Lie flat on your back, bend your knees keeping your feet flat on the floor. Then raise your body so your weight is on your feet and upper body and your bottom and lower back is off the floor. Keep your body straight and hold this position. When Miranda says to 'pulse' for 30 seconds, this means holding the position but squeezing your bottom cheeks and thrusting your hips up and down in small movements. LUNGES: From standing, take a step forward and lower your body down till the front leg is at a 90 degree angle to the floor, then push back up to standing. For 'alternative' lunges as Miranda recommends, take it in turn to step forward with each leg. WALL SIT: This is similar to a squat (see above) but done with your back flat against a wall. Once in the squat position, hold it for a minute rather than continually squatting up and down. Burn fat: Mountain climbers raise your heart rate and tone the stomach . MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS: Bend down on the floor with your hands palm down and arms straight and then move your legs in a running motion bringing alternative knees up to the chest and straightening the leg again. Julia said this is another great move for toning and conditioning. She said: 'Mountain climbers are fantastic exercise, offering a total body workout in single “do anywhere” move. The core is activated to keep the body in position while you power the legs out behind you. They are hardcore, but if you want to burn body fat these will definitely get you ignited!'","Model, 31, has revealed the secret behind her slim and toned body .

"St. Louis' Gateway Arch was allegedly a bombing target of two men, who are also accused of having an alleged murder plot meant for two  officials, it was reported Wednesday. The alleged schemes and targets, namely Ferguson's Chief of Police Tom Jackson and St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, were revealed by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Ali Davis allegedly purchased a fake pipe bomb during a sting operation - and had hoped they could purchase another two bombs though the pair lacked  sufficient funds, sources told the newspaper. Indicted: Olajuwon Davis, pictured, is one of the men who allegedly had a plot to bomb the Gateway Arch. Sources have said that Davis was in charge of the plan . The newspaper reported that its sources expressed skepticism that the alleged plots could have been achieved by Baldwin and Davis. Davis was allegedly in charge  and more charges stemming from the scheme may come soon, the sources told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Baldwin and Davis were indicted on gun charges last week, and the alleged murder and bomb plots are not included in their indictment, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted. The newspaper obtained and published a copy of the indictment, which has been unsealed. Sometime from November 1 to November 13 Baldwin had said he was purchasing two guns for himself at a Hazelwood gun store, though they were being purchased for someone else, the document said. The Gateway Arch was supposed to have a bomb placed in its observation deck, sources told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Baldwin and Davis have been charged with 'aiding and abetting the making of a false written statement in connection with a firearms purchase,' the newspaper reported. The media outlet also reported that search warrants for two buildings were served. Davis and Baldwin appeared in court on Tuesday and entered not guilty pleas - and 'waived their right to make a case for bail, so the hearing did not proceed,' according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The newspaper noted that the New Black Panthers dismissed the allegations against Davis and Baldwin in a statement. The two men were the subjects of a months-long investigation, sources told television station KDSK. Brandon Orlando Baldwin, seen here, was also allegedly involved in the plot .","St. Louis' Gateway Arch was allegedly a bombing target of Brandon Orlando Baldwin and Olajuwon Ali Davis, who were arrested on Friday .

"If you were sunbathing on a beach over the summer but could only think of buying your Christmas turkey, tinsel and tree you are not alone. New research has confirmed the common complaint that the festive period starts earlier every year - August 19 to be exact. According to a study by the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) internet searches for terms such as 'Santa Claus', 'elf and 'presents' now increase markedly during the summer holidays. Statisticians say this means are now thinking about Christmas almost three months earlier than in 2007. Christmas IS getting earlier every year: Shoppers in Bristol standing close to the shopping centre's Christmas tree, but new research has revealed many now start planning for the festive period in August . Getting ready: The Christmas tree season has started with farms like this one in Germany, pictured today, which is getting ready to send them all over Europe in time for December 25 . Data analyst Nathan Cunningham looked at the volume of Christmas-related Google searches in each of the past six years. In doing so he managed to work out the probability of each week being defined as 'Christmas' or 'not Christmas using an algorithm he originally created for research into fossil pollen. He found that from a relatively late start of November 11 in 2007, we turned our minds to Christmas as early as August 19 in 2012. Christmas started on October 12 in 2008 and August 30 in 2009 before a slight delay to October 3 in 2010 and September 11 in 2011. However the last two years have seen the start settle at August 19 and August 25. Mr Cunningham's results are included in a paper entitled Does Christmas really come earlier every year?, which earned him a runner-up prize in this year's Young Statisticians Writing Competition organised by the RSS and Significance magazine. Describing his findings as 'a little startling', Mr Cunningham said: 'From a seemingly late beginning of November 11 in 2007 we had begun turning our minds to thoughts of the festive season as early as August 25 in 2013. 'While this of course seems absurdly early it should be borne in mind that the beginning of the Christmas period here reflects a marked change in our mindsets to thoughts of Christmas, and not the beginning of the full-blown holiday season. 'Nevertheless, it would appear that the prevailing notion is correct: Christmas is indeed coming earlier every year.' Early start: An employee at Selfridges in London checking the festive display which was unveiled on August 4 this year . Be prepared: Clinton Cards started selling Christmas Cards in Agust this year . RSS executive director Hetan Shah said: 'This is a great example of using publicly-available statistics to take a fresh look at an age-old debate. 'Whilst many of us haven't even started our Christmas shopping yet, this study suggests people are turning their minds to the festive period earlier and earlier.' Retailing giant Selfridges opened its Christmas store in early August with a scant 142 shopping days left to buy all the celebration's essentials. The department store proudly claims to be the first in the world to launch its Christmas shop this year. Clinton Cards decided to get the countdown to festive period under way in August when it started selling Christmas cards. But the decision by one pub to put its tree up in August made customers upset. Manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up a 12ft tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn restaurant in Ashford, Kent - despite there still being 140 days to go. But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, took down the tree because the plan 'backfired'.","Royal Statistical Society find Christmas enters British minds over summer .

"A ghost hunter staying overnight at a house where six children and two adults were killed by an ax murderer in 1912 has stabbed himself in the chest. Robert Laursen, 37, stabbed himself for no obvious reason just before 1am Friday at the Villisca Ax Murder House, a tourist attraction in Villisca, Iowa. Laursen was taken to hospital after inflicting the wound on himself. Local authorities could not ascribe a motive to his actions. Scroll down for video . 'Stabbed himself': Robert Laursen, 37, wounded himself at the Villisca Ax Murder House in Iowa in the early hours of Friday . The Ax Murder House is the site of a grisly 1912 murder, where eight victims were killed in their sleep by an ax-wielding killer who was never caught. According to local authorities, Laursen was carrying out a 'paranormal investigation' when he stabbed himself with an unknown object. It is not clear where in the house he was at the time. Laursen is thought to have had at least two companions. The Sheriff's department in Montgomery County, Iowa, said there was 'no indications of foul play' that night and that no criminal charges will be issued. Murder scene: Eight people were butchered in their beds at the house, pictured, in 1912 . 'Paranormal': Laursen was conducting a ghost hunt at the house, though it is not known where he was when he stabbed himself. He reportedly had two companions . The house, which is a well-known tourist attraction, has been restored to its 1912 condition and has no plumbing or electric lights. Laursen, from Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was taken to a local hospital then flown to Creighton Medical Center for more serious treatment. The owner of the house, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, has said called the event 'shocking'. History: The house, which still has no electricity or plumbing, is now a magnet for crime enthusiasts, who book daytime or overnight tours . Martha Linn, 77, told the Omaha World-Herald: 'It’s kind of shocking to wake up and hear that someone has nearly died at your tourist attraction... I can’t imagine why somebody would do something like this to himself.' According to Linn, a steady stream of crime enthusiasts visit the home, where day tours and overnight stays are on offer, in the hope of solving the case. However, nothing violent or dangerous has ever happened at the attraction in the 20 years it has been open.

"In what looks to be a horror movie come to life, a terrifying video shows as a hospital patient tears through a hospital attacking nurses with a large metal pole. Charles Emmett Logan Sr., of St. Paul, Minnesota, attacked multiple nurses over the weekend at St. John's Hospital, running through the nurse's station and hallways of the building as he violently swung a large metal pole at every person he came across. In the end, four nurses suffered severe injuries, including a collapsed lung and broken wrist. Scroll down for video . Horrific attack: Charles Emmett Logan (circled in red) attacked multiple nurses with a metal pole in the early morning hours on Saturday . Horror movie: The man had been a patient at St. John's Hospital in Minnesota . Unknown cause: It is not certain why he attacked, though medical workers did reveal he suffered from paranoia . The nurses injured in the attack were identified as 40-year-old Leslie Lichey; 22-year-old Brooke Scott; 32-year-old Nicole Eenisse; and 30-year-old Kelly Roberto. It is not known what caused the attack, though Logan, 68, did suffer from paranoia according to medical workers. Making the entire incident even more bizarre, police were unable to subdue Logan when they located him three blocks away, and, according to KARE, three officers were needed to take him down after the probes of their Taser failed to attach and take him down. Then, when they finally managed to get handcuffs on him, he suddenly died. Scary moments: The man ran through the nurse's station and hallway hitting everyone he came across . Victims: Four nurses suffered serious injuries as a result of the attack . Badly hurt: The worst was one woman who suffered a collapsed lung . An autopsy has been scheduled. 'Those familiar with Mr. Logan described a very recent change in which he became confused and periodically delusional,' said the police department in a release. 'Nothing in Mr. Logan's past or more recent history indicates a tendency toward violence.' One officer on the scene reports that Shane Perry, Logan's lawyer, said the incident occurred after a family disagreement earlier in the day. It is uncertain what exactly happened, but according to The Star Tribune, 'there was a difference of opinion between Logan and his wife and daughter about his treatment — so much so that Perry sought an emergency order from a Ramsey County judge to protect his client.' Logan told Perry at the hospital that he wanted to sell his house and give half of the money to his grandchildren, which he believes indicated that he wanted a separation from his wife. The family then caused a scene until Perry left the hospital. Running for their lives: Nurses could be seen fleeing from their station into the hallway . On the move: Logan was eventually found by police three blocks away from the hospital . Tragic end: Logan died shortly after police handcuffed him, this after he was hit with a Taser and wrestled to the ground . Officers were called roughly five hours later, shortly before 2 am when there was a report a man with episodes of confusion had suddenly attacked the nurses at the hospital. The actual video footage tracks Logan as he goes from nurse's station to the hallway, hitting anyone he can and not seeming to focus on any specific worker. The nurses are caught completely off guard when he first appears, rushing to the door as he lands blow after blow. 'It is fortunate that hospital personnel were not more seriously injured in the unprovoked attack,' said Maplewood Police Chief Paul Schnell. 'While what prompted the attack may never be known, we await completion of the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's inquiry, which we hope might answer questions about Mr. Logan's status for the sake of his family and all those involved in this incident.'","Charles Emmett Logan, 68, attacked multiple nurses with a large metal pole at St. John's Hospital in the early morning hours of Sunday .

"The number of children in care has risen to a record level following the death of Baby P and a spate of child exploitation scandals, a watchdog reported yesterday. The National Audit Office said the care system for children has not improved under the Coalition and called on the Department for Education, which is in charge of the system, ‘to break this pattern’. Children are still shunted between foster and care homes, and many are sent to live many miles from their original homes. The number of children in care has risen to a record level following the death of Baby P (pictured) They are a quarter as likely to get good school exam results as other children, and more than a third end up at the age of 19 without jobs or the hope of qualifications. The NAO inquiry comes six years after the Baby P trial, which convicted the mother of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, her boyfriend and his brother for involvement in his death. Peter had been seen 60 times by Haringey social workers, NHS workers and police officers, none of whom acted to prevent his death. Since then the number of children taken into care by social workers has risen 15 per cent and this year there were a record 68,840 living in children’s homes or with foster parents. Flowers and tributes were left for Baby P on the second anniversary of his death - since he died the number of children taken into care by social workers has risen 15 per cent . But the NAO, which is responsible for examining Whitehall spending, said the Government ‘cannot demonstrate that it is meeting its objectives’ for children in care. ‘The long-term consequences of such children not getting the right care are poorer outcomes for them and increased costs to taxpayers,’ it said. The report said the £2.5 billion spending on the care system in 2012-13 was a three per cent rise in two years. The NAO said the Government ‘cannot demonstrate that it is meeting its objectives’ for children in care . However, councils were under pressure ‘because of a rapid rise in children being taken into care, following the widely-reported abuse and death of Baby P in 2007, while many local authorities expect or are already experiencing a rise in referrals linked to child exploitation scandals’. On average, it costs between £29,000 and £33,000 a year to place a child with foster parents, the method used to look after three quarters of the children in care. A place in a children’s home costs more than four times as much, between £131,000 and £135,000 a year on average. It said that despite DfE efforts to bring more stability to the lives of children in care, more than one in ten move home more than three times in a year, and 34 per cent move home at least once. More than a third of children in residential homes live more than 20 miles from their original home. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said too many children are not getting the right placements the first time. ‘If their complex and challenging needs are not correctly assessed and tackled, the result is likely to be long-term detriment to the children themselves as well as cost to society,’ he said. ‘No progress has been made in the last four years.’","Number of children in care hits all time high following Baby P and child exploitation scandals across the country .

"It might not answer the age-old question of whether the chicken or the egg came first, but biologists have located the spot where they think the first domestic chickens appeared. Researchers claim to have found the earliest evidence for chicken domestication in an area around the Yellow River in northern China. They obtained DNA from 10,500 year old fossilised bones that confirmed they belonged to the same lineage as modern domestic chickens. The fossilised remains of domesticated chickens found at the Nanzhuangtou site in Xushiui County, northern China, are closely related to the red jungle fowl, which is thought to have roamed the area at the time . The researchers analysed fossilised chicken bones (top right) from four locations around north and east China with the oldest being found at the Nanzhuangtou archaeological site near the Yellow River . The results show that the animals, found  buried beneath a peat bog in China's Xushiui County, Hebei, are the oldest examples of domesticated chicken by several thousand years and traces of their genomes are still found in the birds sold in supermarkets today. It is thought that these birds spread out around Asia but later were bred with other ancient species of fowl to produce the modern domesticated birds that appear on our supermarket shelves today. The  bones found in northern China were closely related to the red jungle fowl, Gallus gallus gallus. Professor Michi Hofreiter, a palaeogeneticist at the  University of York and the University of Postdam in Germany, said: 'These are really exciting results as they suggest that societies with mixed agriculture developed in northern China around the same time they did so in the Near East. 'Our analyses also suggest that northern China represents one region of the earliest chicken domestication. Domestic chickens sold in supermarkets today still contain same genetic elements in the mitochondrial DNA as the birds that were domesticated in northern China more than 10,000 years ago . 'Chickens represent by far the most important poultry species, yet the number, locations, and timings of their domestication have remained controversial for more than a century. 'Our results these early domesticated chickens contributed to the gene pool of modern chicken populations. 'Moreover, our results support the idea that multiple members of the genus Gallus, specifically Gallus gallus and Gallus sonneratii (grey jungle fowl) contributed to the gene pool of the modern domestic chicken.' The scientists, whose results are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, sequenced the mitochondrial DNA from 39 chicken bones found at four different sites scattered around northern and east-central China. Modern domesticated chickens were found to share genetic similarities, or haplotypes, with other ground dwelling birds from around the world which allowed the scientists to trace their origins . Most livestock and pets we know today were originally tamed from the wild when humans began setting down in permanent settlements and began farming around 8,000 years ago. Dogs are thought to have been first being bred for tameness around 15,000 years ago from wild wolves in Asia. Sheep began appearing as a domestic species of the mouflon in the Middle East 10,000 years ago. Pigs were domesticated both in the Middle East and in China around 8,000 years ago while cattle also appeared in the Middle East. Brahman cattle are thought to have originated 6,000 years ago from wild species in Pakistan. Horses were domesticated from wild populations in many different places but were first thought to have appeared 6,000 years ago in Central Asia . Domesticated Llamas began appearing in Peru around 4,500 years ago from their wild relatives the guanaco. These ranged from being between 2,300 years old and 10,500 years old. The researchers then compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences with those from six different related fowl species along with ancient specimens found in Spain, Hawaii, Chile and Easter Island. Using phylogentic analysis, where the DNA was used to trace the evolutionary relationship between the species, the scientists found that the bones from the Chinese sites belonged to domestic birds. They were also closely related to taxonomic genus that includes modern domesticated chickens and  wild red jungle fowl. The DNA sequences found in the oldest bones from northern China were found to represent three major groups of mitochondrial DNA that are present in the modern chicken gene pool. This suggests that there has been a continuous genetic line from these oldest domestic chickens and modern populations. Many scientists had previously doubted whether the bones could belong to domesticated red jungle fowl as the area where they were found is too boggy and cold to be their usual habitat. However, around 10,000 years ago, the area would have looked very different with dense jungle thriving in a warm, humid climate. Professor Xingbo Zhao, who led the research at the China Agricultural University, said: 'People argued that northern China did not provide suitable habitat for red jungle fowl, the wild ancestor of domestic chickens but they do not take into account that climate and vegetation were very different 10,000 years ago.' Previously the oldest evidence of domesticated chickens dated back to around 7,000 years ago. However, the first animals thought to have been domesticated for livestock were sheep in the Middle East around 11,000 years ago. Previous research by Professor Zhao and his colleagues has shown, however, that other animals now commonly bred for human consumption were also originally domesticated in China. They found that pigs were domesticated in the Wu’an county of Hebei in northern China, also close to the Yellow river around 7,300 years ago. Evidence of barley and millet farming have also been found there. Archaeologists have also found that ox may also have been first domesticated in Asia.","Mitochondrial DNA extracted from fossilised bones found near to Yellow River in northern China were found to still exist in domestic species today .

"Authorities say a 37-year-old man was drunk when he crashed his car into a Syracuse-area home, setting off a fire that destroyed the house. The Onondaga County Sheriff's Office says Brian Aust of the town of Clay was driving on Route 31 around 1 a.m. Wednesday when he lost control of his car and hit a vehicle parked in a driveway in his hometown. Deputies say his car then hit the house, striking a natural gas line and sparking a fire that spread to his vehicle and the home. Bad day: Clay, New York resident Brian Aust was allegedly drunk Wednesday morning when he careened off the road after hitting a mailbox and then a parked car. He then smashed into a home, which ignited a gas line and set the home and the car on fire . According to Syracuse.com, Aust first over-corrected after smashing into a roadside mailbox. His Hyundai Elantra then swerved to the opposite side of the road and collided with a parked car. The collision sent his car careening into the home and a gas light was ignited. The home, as well as Aust's Elantra, went up in flames. The homeowner and another family member pulled Austin from his burning car before it became fully engulfed. Deputies say the family has been left homeless. It was a 'complete loss' Onondaga County Detective Jon Seeber said. Aust suffered only minor injuries to his face. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance. He's charged with driving while intoxicated, felony first-degree aggravated unlicensed operation, imprudent speed and failure to keep right. It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer. 'Complete loss': Officials say the home was a total loss and that the residents have been left homeless .","Brian Aust, 37, crashed into a Clay, New York mailbox, swerved across the street into a parked car and then careened into a home, igniting its gas line ."
"Four drunken teenagers beat a man to death in a savage attack in an underpass before going on to a party, a court heard. The group - three boys aged 15, 16 and 17 at the time and a girl who was 16 - launched a vicious group assault on Michael Green, 23, which left him with fatal head injuries, Cambridge Crown Court heard. Mr Green was hit twice  with a vodka bottle by the 16-year-old boy, knocking him to the floor, before the other boys kicked and stamped on him repeatedly as he lay dead or dying in May, the jury was told. The girl then walked over to his prostrate body and stamped on his face in apparent revenge for him accidentally striking her earlier that evening, the court heard. Bretton murder victim Michael Green was  beaten to death by four teenagers on their way to a party, a court has heard . Jane Bickerstaff QC said: 'It began with a vicious assault by the 16-year-old using a weapon inflicting brute force to Michael Green's head and causing him to fall to the floor. He never got up from that blow. 'The other three defendants saw that blow and saw its effects clearly. They saw Michael Green fall to the floor. They then got in on the act using ... either their fists or their feet while Michael Green remained on the floor defenceless.' All four defendants had been drinking heavily before the attack, the court heard, including two who had been bought vodka by Green and spent the afternoon and early evening drinking with him at his home in the Bretton area of the city. Green was also heavily drunk and affected by medication he was also taking. The defendants, all but the youngest of whom are now 17, all deny murder and grievous bodily harm. The girl also denies a charge of attempting to pervert the court of justice relating to claims she tried to make a witness change her evidence before the trial. The 23 year-old was found dead by a dog walker in a subway in Peterborough, on May 28 this year . The court heard that while drinking at his home earlier with the 16-year-old girl, the 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old female friend of theirs, Green became very drunk and came on to the 15-year-old, making her feel 'uncomfortable', and urging her to dump her boyfriend, the then 16-year-old defendant. When the 17-year-old defendant told Mr Green to stop he became violent, pinning him by the throat. The court heard Mr Green was on antidepressants and painkillers after fracturing his collarbone and should not have been drinking while taking them. Mr Green's mother, Barbara, told the jury that, despite not wearing a sling, her son had nevertheless been in some pain from his collarbone injury, caused by falling from a tree, and still could not lift his arm up to his head. She said he had appeared drunk on the night of his death but when she told him not to go out he swore at her. 'I said 'You should go to bed, you are not well, you have a bad shoulder and you are not in the right mood',' Mrs Green added. She thought the two girls at the house looked under-age but her son told her they were 18, she said, adding that he said knew them through Facebook. She described his hitting of the female defendant as an accidental 'flamboyant' wave of the arm for which he immediately apologised, which the girl seemed to accept. Mr Green was hit twice and knocked down in the  underpass with a vodka bottle by the 16-year-old boy, before the other boys kicked and stamped on him repeatedly as he lay dead or dying, the jury was told . Damen Fitzpatrick, Mr Green's best friend, who had been with him and the girls earlier in the day before going home unwell, told the court that his friend had been going through a tough time, having split with a girlfriend a few months previously as well as injuring himself. He said he had also warned his friend not to drink while taking medication, adding: 'I told him not to because I was really concerned about him.' The three friends then left Mr Green's house to meet the two other defendants who had been at a party. The court heard that the victim followed them and when they met at the underpass the 16-year-old confronted him about his actions at the house. Mr Green offered to fight all the boys before shoving the 15-year-old girl out the way, the court heard. This prompted her boyfriend to 'whack him' with the bottle, the prosecution claims, starting the attack. Miss Bickerstaff said after the initial assault the group walked a few metres away but could still see the victim laying in the same position. The defendants, all but the youngest of whom are now 17, all denied murder and grievous bodily harm at Cambridge Crown Court . She added: 'The girl then said something like 'f*** this' and then ran over and turned Michael Green over and stamped on him hard on the head, saying 'that is for hitting me earlier'.' She added: 'The girl had clearly seen what they had done and she joined herself to the enterprise by using the same type of force they had used and then she left with the others.' The group robbed Mr Green of his wallet, mobile phone and a neck chain and bracelet, the court heard, before going on to the nearby party. Other partygoers claim they were boasting at the party of having beaten up Mr Green, the court heard, with the 16-year-old boy telling a friend he had 'bottled someone' and the 17-year-old saying 'yeah, I hit him really hard'. The four defendants voluntarily went to police the following day, May 28, after news broke of Mr Green being found dead in the underpass, and were later charged.

"A 101-year-old woman who lived through the Great Depression received a standing ovation after giving a rousing 90-minute talk to an unemployment group. Annie Murphy spoke without notes about a difficult childhood which saw her defy her alcoholic father's wishes to attend grammar school - a five-mile walk away each day - and train as a teacher. The 30 job-seeking adult learners at Gateshead's Dryden Centre were so impressed she has now been nominated for a local award. Inspiring: Now 101, Annie Murphy (left today and right in her youth) received a standing ovation when she gave an inspiring talk to unemployed adult learners in Gateshead about the importance of education . Ms Murphy's talk began with her childhood in Gateshead, where she was born in 1913. She attended school aged five but her alcoholic father, who returned from the First World War with 'shell shock' - now known as post-traumatic stress disorder - wanted her at home. When she turned 11 he tried to stop her attending the local grammar school, too. 'He wanted me at home looking after my four little brothers and my sister,' she said. 'But even though it involved a five mile walk and two train journeys every day, I was determined to be educated'. Thanks to her endurance Ms Murphy earned the qualifications to embark on a two-year teacher training course in 1932. Strong-willed: As a child, Ms Murphy's alcoholic father wanted to stop her from attending school . But before she had the chance to begin her career, the Great Depression struck. She was left having to search for work, and eventually secured a teaching position in Coxhoe, County Durham. 'I know what it's like when you can't find work through no fault of your own, and that's what I told them during my talk,' she said. The talk also took in major events throughout her lifetime such as the miners' strike and the 27-year imprisonment of Nelson Mandela, who she described as one of her heroes. The struggle for Ms Murphy did not end when she found a job, however. She told the adult learners she was angry that would have to give up her job if she found a husband. That never happened, however - as in the same year that she met her future husband Michael, the Second World War broke out. Because men were needed to fight overseas, she could continue teaching, albeit with a £1-a-week pay cut. It meant she was lucky never to experience long-term unemployment again, and retired happily at the age of 60 after separating from her husband. Ms Murphy's talk was arranged by a reminiscence group at the Addison Court Nursing Home where she lives in Crawcrook, Tyne and Wear. Afterwards she said she had wanted to support people who were struggling to find work by sharing her experiences, having lived through war and the worst recessions of the 20th Century. The home's activities co-ordinator Deb Carter said: 'Annie is just amazing. When she gave her talk, the audience were absolutely fascinated. 'Her memory is crystal clear and she brought events they'd only read about, to life. We are now hoping to line up more talks for her - she really is an inspiration.' Ms Murphy has now been nominated for an award by a 'Workability Group' in the city, which helps find qualifications for people without a job. Education: Ms Murphy (back row, far right) as a teacher at Kelloe Primary School in Counry Durham. The struggle did not end when she found work, she said - as she found institutional sexism in the school system . The Great Depression began with the Wall Street Crash in October 1929, when years of rapid growth and hedonistic wealth reached a sudden peak. Images of distraught stock market traders hurling themselves from the newly-built skyscrapers of New York, days after the crash, became some of the most harrowing of the 20th Century. In the U.S., almost half the country's banks failed and up to 15million were out of work - but the pain was also felt keenly in Britain. By 1933 a quarter of the UK workforce was jobless. The people of Jarrow, near Gateshead, even arranged a 'crusade' march on Westminster - whereupon they were told to go home and figure it out for themselves. The Depression was only fully over once preparations began for the Second World War - an effort which cost millions and prompted an obvious boom in manufacturing. It was often said to be the worst in British history, but many economists have suggested the current slump is worse. Although the crash of 1929 was much more dramatic than that in 2008, analysis by Forbes suggests the economy picked up again more quickly afterwards. British Gross Domestic Product has largely flatlined since the crash, according to the analysts - compared to the Depression where it lifted beyond the pre-1929 level after the worst was over.","Adult learners gave Annie Murphy standing ovation after Gateshead talk .

"This is the shocking moment a shopper watched a pregnant woman and her young son beg for money - before getting into a Mercedes Benz and driving away. Melissa Smith, from San Diego, California, had witnessed the expectant mother and her child panhandling outside Eastlake Village Center every weekend for the past two weeks. Each time, they would hold a sign reading, 'Please help', and would receive money from dozens of shoppers. 'Lots of people gave them money,' Ms Smith said. 'Probably five people in five minutes.' Scroll down for video . Begging: Shopper Melissa Smith, from San Diego, California, had witnessed this expectant mother and her child begging for money outside the city's Eastlake Village Center every weekend for the past two weeks . But this week, Ms Smith was putting gas into her car when she saw the pair leave their panhandling spot and meet up with the woman's boyfriend - before driving away in a dark-colored Mercedes. 'I noticed they grabbed their little boy and they got into a Mercedes-Benz,' she told KGTV. 'I thought, ""Wow, a Mercedes-Benz. It's not even used - it's not old. It's a new Benz.""' The car appears to be an older Mercedes C320, which sold for $30,000 to $35,000 new. In outrage, Ms Smith immediately stopped pumping gas, climbed into her own car and followed the Mercedes down the road, while snapping photos of the luxury vehicle and its license plate. 'Lo and beyond they were in front of us,' she said. 'Here they are counting money, laughing and their little boy is not in a car seat or seat belt. He's all the way in the front seat with them.' Ride home: This week, Ms Smith was pumping gas into her car when she saw the pair leave their begging spot and meet up with the woman's partner - before driving away in a dark-colored Mercedes Benz (pictured) Caught on camera: Ms Smith took this photo of the car as it drove toward a shopping plaza on Bonita Road . Astonishingly, Ms Smith watched the car turn into a nearby shopping plaza on Bonita Road, before the pregnant woman got out, grabbed the sign and started begging again. As shoppers reached into their pockets to help her, Ms Smith started taking more photos of the woman, prompting the beggar to start shouting at her. She later sent the photos to KGTV.

"A former milkman accused of killing schoolgirl Claire Tiltman has admitted going on 'midnight walks' armed with knives and an air pistol to find someone to attack. Colin Ash-Smith, 46, called himself an 'animal' and said he was 'obsessed' with women, but hated them because he feared their 'power'. He also confessed to stockpiling and carrying knives because they made him feel 'powerful' and carrying out savage knife and sex attacks on women. Colin Ash-Smith (pictured left) is on trial for the murder of Claire Tiltman (right), who was killed in January 1993, just four days after her 16th birthday . A court drawing of Colin Ash-Smith, who denies the murder of schoolgirl Claire Tiltman in 1993 . Ash-Smith is on trial for stabbing Claire to death in a dark alleyway in Greenhithe, Kent, in 1993, just four days after her 16th birthday. Jurors at Inner London Crown Court had earlier heard that he has admitted stabbing two young women in 1988 and 1995 and leaving them for dead - but they both survived. Entering the witness box at Inner London Crown Court for the first time, he admitted to trying to murder and sexually assaulting a young mother near a quarry in 1988. He said: 'By that time I regularly went out about once or twice a week in the early hours of the morning. 'I would wait for my mum and dad to go to sleep first and then I would go out. I was 19 or 20. 'That was the first time I started doing it, in 1988. I used to do it quite regularly. I used to call them my midnight walks. School friends of Claire Tiltman - Philippa Fellows (left), Jo Roberts (centre) and Emma Edwards (right) arrive at Inner London Crown Court earlier this month for her trial - which is being held two decades after her death . 'I was hoping I would see someone and provoke someone into attacking me.' He said he never set out to rape and try to kill a woman. But jurors heard that once he found his victim he subjected her to attack and 'humiliation' by taking photos of her in sexual poses. Asked why he attacked the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, he said: 'I wanted to feel empowered, that I had control over someone. That I wasn't a doormat.' Ash-Smith obsessively wrote down his 'successful' attacks and his other plots in diaries he called his 'Assault Plans'. And he gave his attacks percentage marks to score his performance. He described the attack in 1988 as '95 per cent successful' and his 'masterpiece'. Parents: Claire's mother Linda and father Cliff, who died before a suspect was ever charged . Police pictured in 1993 searching for clues in a nearby forest during their investigation into her death . Police cordon off the murder scene of Claire Tiltman in Greenhithe, Kent, in 1993 . Asked why he carried out the attack, he told the court: 'I can't remember exactly, but the way I used to be, I would probably say there is no-one to stop me. 'I had a very limited moral compass.' Describing how he feels looking back at that attack, he told jurors: 'I always thought I would protect women, would protect people, wouldn't harm people, but I failed miserably, to be honest. The one chance I got to show restraint and wouldn't do anything and walk away, and I failed miserably. 'Before that I thought I was a reasonably good person. But, to be honest, I was an animal.'

"With a heated swimming pool, private cellar and three acres of garden, you might say this five-bedroom mansion is fit for a King. And, if local legend is to be believed, the £1.2m property really is home to one of the greatest monarchs in British history. According to those living in Caerleon, South Wales, this stunning house, which is encased by a 19th century stone wall, is the final resting place of the legendary King Arthur and his famous knights. This five-mansion property in Caerleon, South Wales has gone on the market for £1.2m - and is rumoured to be where King Arthur is buried . According to local legend, the famous leader and his knights are buried under a mound in the three acres of garden (pictured) The house, known as the Mynde, is just a few hundred yards from the remains of the town's Roman amphitheatre, believed to be the setting for Arthur's round table . Historian say the king's final resting place is at Glastonbury Abbey, Somerset, while others believe he lies in a cave in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. But the famous leader and his men are rumoured to be buried under a mound in the three-acre garden at the house in Caerleon, where he was chronicled as visiting on several occasions. To add to the folklore, the house – known as the Mynde – is just a few hundred yards from the remains of the town's Roman amphitheatre, which is believed to be the setting for Arthur's round table. Chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth described Arthur as holding court at Caerleon in his Historia Regum Britanniae, written in 1133. Legend says that the sixth-century leader, who helped Britons hold back Saxon invaders between 500 and 550AD, is simply sleeping until the day he is needed again by his people, when he will return to save Britain from its peril. Until then, history buffs wanting to buy the property will be content with the fact the grounds are on the site of a Norman motte and bailey castle. The current owners have unearthed various Roman and Normal archaeological remains from the garden. Although the property is steeped in history, ultra-modern development means there is now a swimming pool (pictured), a sauna,  a separate party room with a bar and a private cellar . The building is also surrounded by a 19th century stone wall, built as protection by the local sheriff during the Chartist uprisings of 1839 . As well as a huge, well-manicured garden, the grounds back onto the Celtic Manor Golf Resort, the home of this year's Ryder Cup . The building is also surrounded by a 19th century stone wall, built as protection by the local sheriff during the Chartist uprisings of 1839. Despite being drenched in history, the owners have added ultra-modern touches to the home, meaning there is now a swimming pool, changing rooms and showers, sauna, and a separate party room with bar. The house also comprises of seven reception rooms, as well as three acres of garden, which backs onto the Celtic Manor Golf Resort, home of this year's Ryder Cup. Simon Riggall, from Lambert Smith Hampton Auctions, who are selling the property: 'This is the perfect house for a history lover. It's in a beautiful location, and is a perfect family home. 'It's certainly a unique property and we've never sold anything quite like it before.' Thought to have lived during the late fifth and early sixth centuries, the original King Arthur (depicted right in a painting) is believed to have led the fight against the invading Saxons. However, the King Arthur that many people are familiar with today – thanks to TV shows, films and stage productions – is said to be a combination of many different myths and legends that have developed over the last 1,000 years. Modern historians often equate him with King Alfred the Great, the Dark Ages ruler of Wessex who led the fight against the invading Danes, eventually stopping them in their tracks. Either way, according to medieval romances and the Historia Brittonum, Arthur was a great king who defended Britain from enemies both earthly and supernatural. Arthurian legend claims Arthur was the son and heir of King Uther Pendragon, and was believed to have born on Castle Island in Tintagel, North Cornwall. Tintagel still exists in ruined form in Cornwall, although others have claimed that he was Welsh. A sorcerer called Merlin is said to have taken a sword called Excalibur from the so-called Lady of the Lake for King Uther, but upon the King’s death, he placed the sword in a stone. Merlin stated that ‘he who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.’ After the King's death, Arthur is said to have pulled Merlin’s Excalibur sword from this stone, proving his right to the throne. The legend doesn’t specify exactly where this lake was and there is a debate on whether it was Martin Mere in Lancashire, the Lily Ponds at Bosherston, or Dozmary Pool on the edge of Bodmin Moor. The latter is closest to the supposed birthplace in Cornwall. Legend continues that during his reign, in the kingdom of Camelot, King Arthur met with his knights at a Round Table, journeyed after the Holy Grail and fought a number of battles using the infamous sword. During the Battle of Camlann, in approximately 537, King Arthur was killed and his body was sent to the Isle of Avalon. Historians believe this area was Glastonbury and the Somerset levels. But there are other theories that King Arthur is buried on Mount Etna, the Eildon Hills in Roxburghshire or a cave in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. Later, legend expanded the story and claimed upon Arthur's death, the sword was returned to the Lady of the Lake. Early written accounts of the Arthurian story appeared in 1130 in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain where he claimed Merlin had the 15-year-old Arthur crowned at nearby Silchester, in Reading. Legend also says that the king could be buried at Glastonbury Abbey, Somerset, (left) or even Mount Etna, Sicily (right) The first mention of the Round Table, however, was in Robert Wace's Roman de Brut in 1155. This book claimed the round table was a wedding gift to Arthur from Guinevere's father, Leodegrance and is now believed to be hung in the Great Hall in Winchester. Arthur was said to have sat his knights on the round table so that none was ever in a position of power of importance. Whatever the truth of the real King Arthur, one thing is clear. According to prophesy, King Arthur and his knights – who are currently 'sleeping' – will return to Earth to defend Britain at its moment of greatest peril.","Local legend says the famous leader and his knights are allegedly buried under a mound in the garden of the house .

"Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old brain cancer sufferer who legally took her own life three weeks ago, appears in a new video released Wednesday calling upon states across the country to introduce new right-to-die laws. The footage to mark what would have been Maynard's 30th birthday shows her impassioned plea for a change in the law on behalf of other terminally ill patients who want to 'die with dignity'. Maynard, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given six months to live this spring, grabbed the national spotlight for about a month after publicizing that she and her husband moved to Portland from California so she could use Oregon's law to end her life with dignity. Maynard ended her life on Nov. 1. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New video: To mark what would have been the 30th birthday of Brittany Maynard, a right-to-die advocacy group has issued new video footage of her final interviews, three weeks after her death . Hitting back: Maynard defends her decision in the footage saying she suffered no coercion in her decision . The new video includes photographs of Maynard before her illness. It also features the voices of other terminally ill patients and their family members. Oregon was the first state to allow terminally ill patients to die using lethal medications prescribed by a doctor. 'I hope for the sake of other American citizens all these people that I'm speaking to that I'll never meet, that I've never met that this choice be extended to you. This right - that we mobilize it, we vocalize it, we start to talk about it,' Maynard says to camera. 'I decided to share my story because I felt this issue of death with dignity is misunderstood. I felt very valued by my physicians here, very protected. There's no way I could have possibly been coerced into this. It's not a fear-based choice - it's a logic-based choice. I'm coming to realize how much our community fears death and shuns death and how much of the medical community almost view death as a failure. 'If I can play, even the smallest part in helping to reduce fear or misunderstanding then it's worth speaking up for.' Since her death Maynard's impact has indeed been felt and her choice to die has already sparked debate across the country. Four other U.S. states allow patients to seek aid in dying: Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico. Compassion & Choices says legislators in about a dozen further states plan to introduce right-to-die laws next year, including in Wyoming and Colorado. But the political reality is that such legislation has been pushed for years, often unsuccessfully. The New Jersey Assembly passed a bill last week that would allow physicians to prescribe life-ending drugs to terminally ill patients, with some legislators citing Maynard's story as a deciding factor in their vote. But Republican Gov. Chris Christie has said he opposes the measure. WATCH BRITTANY'S FINAL MESSAGE . Support: The video includes images of the many messages of support Brittany received since publishing her decision to take her own life . Advocate: Brittany Maynard speaks of her wish to help the right-to-die movement in the video released three weeks after her death. It shows messages from those who agree with her campaign across the U.S. In California, the West Hollywood City Council this week passed a resolution that urges the Los Angeles County District Attorney to not prosecute physicians and family members who offer aid in dying to the terminally ill. But the state has no current bills or ballot measures on the issue. In Pennsylvania, where a death-with-dignity bill was introduced in October, its sponsor Rep. Mark Rozzi admits the bill's passage will be an uphill battle. Rozzi, a Democrat, said it has been difficult getting bills out of the judiciary committee when they are opposed by the state's Catholic leadership. Rozzi, whose 63-year-old father died of the same type of brain cancer as Maynard, said the young woman's campaign and his family's situation made it apparent why such bills are needed in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. 'I had to watch my father die of cancer... It was the most gut-wrenching experience our family and he had to endure,' Rozzi said. 'He would always tell me this is not the way he wanted to live.' Compassion & Choice said its website has had more than 5 million unique visitors during the past month, while Maynard's two previous videos have been viewed more than 13 million times on YouTube alone. 'I sense immense momentum right now,' said Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion & Choices. 'Brittany Maynard is a new voice for a new generation of activists ... she devoted her precious energy to help ensure other dying Americans would have a choice.' Maynard died in the arms of her devoted husband Dan Diaz and was supported throughout her journey by her parents. Maynard passed away in the arms of her husband, Dan Diaz, and surrounded by friends and family in her home in Portland . New message: The new video includes photographs of Maynard before her illness. It also features the voices of other terminally ill patients and their family members. In her latest video Maynard revealed her hopes that they continue her advocacy work. 'I know my family will continue to take this torch along for me that they'll believe in the importance of what I'm doing,' She said. 'If there's one message to come away with from everything I've been through it is no matter what life presents you with, never be afraid to use your voice. Speak up for yourself, advocate.' Not all the response to Brittany's decision has been positive. Some religious groups and social conservatives, including a Vatican official and the American Life League, have heavily criticized it. Just days after Maynard's death, the Vatican's top bioethics official called her choice 'reprehensible' and said physician-assisted suicide should be condemned. But Maynard's mother, Debbie Ziegler, issued a sharp written response, saying the Vatican official's comments came as the family was grieving and were 'more than a slap in the face.' 'My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation,' she wrote. 'Reprehensible is a harsh word. It means: 'very bad; deserving very strong criticism.' Reprehensible is a word I've used as a teacher to describe the actions of Hitler, other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles.' Carryubg the torch: Brittany says he family will now carry the torch and continue her campaign for right-to-die laws across the country. She has been backed by her family including mother Debbie Maynard (right) Support: In the three weeks since her death, Brittany Maynard's mother has already had to fight back against criticism from the Vatican . 'As Brittany Maynard's mother, I find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions.' Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, made the remarks just two days after Miss Maynard, 29, took a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home. Speaking to Italian news agency Ansa, he said: 'This woman (took her own life) thinking she would die with dignity, but this is the error. Suicide is not a good thing. 'It is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission in the world and towards those around us.' Monsignor Carrasco de Paula, whose Academy is responsible for ethical issues in the Catholic Church, even went so far as to describe assisted suicide, in itself, as a reprehensible 'absurdity'. He added: 'Dignity is something different to putting an end to your own life.' The Roman Catholic Church opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide, teaching that life starts at the moment of conception and should end at the moment of natural death. Brittany herself had words for such critics while she was still alive, . In one of her final videos, she hit back at people who questioned her decision. 'When people criticize me for not waiting longer, or whatever they've decided is best for me, it hurts,' she says in the heartbreaking video. 'I still have enough joy and I still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time right now, but it will come because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week.'","In the video, recorded in August by the group Compassion & Choices and released on Wednesday, Maynard calls on more states to enact legislation .

"Most three year olds can't wait for summer so they can play outdoors for hours on end. But for one little boy, being out in the sun causes his skin to blister and burn uncontrollably. Eddison Miller has become one of the youngest people to be diagnosed with a rare and incurable genetic condition which makes him completely intolerant to all UV rays. Eddison's parents Nicola and Andrew Miller try to keep his life as normal as possible, but every part of their son must be covered by UV-protective clothing when he ventures outside. He must wear gloves and a hat with attached visor made of specialist film that covers his face, neck and shoulders and clothes specially selected to block UV rays. Scroll down for video . Three-year-old Eddison Miller must wear a UV-protective suit  and visor (pictured left and right) to play outdoors, as he suffers from a rare condition that causes his skin to severely burn  in UV light . Eddison was diagnosed with incurable genetic condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) at three months old. The condition affects fewer than 1,000 around the world and means he is at an increased risk of getting cancer from sunlight . Eddison must be covered by factor 50+ sun block every three hours (he is pictured left and right playing in his protective suit). He also plays in his own specially-designed indoor garden when it's too bright outside . Eddison's body must also be covered by factor 50+ sun block every three hours and he plays in his own, specially-designed, indoor garden when it is too bright outside. He suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a condition which means he could get cancer from sunlight. His condition affects fewer than 100 people in Britain and about 2,000 around the world, but he is one of the youngest to be told he has the disorder. Mrs Miller, from Kingsnorth, Kent, said their lives 'completely changed' after Eddison's diagnosis at just three months. The 36-year-old, said: 'The condition affects every aspect of his life and we have to think of things that others would take for granted. 'People don't understand the everyday issues we have to consider. 'We have to make sure Eddison isn't near to the door when the postman opens the letterbox and we have had to have an AC system installed because we can't open any windows in our house. 'But he is just a normal little boy. He loves getting messy in his sandpit, playing on his bike or with his little brother Raife. 'Our goal is just to help him live his life like a normal child.' Eddison started displaying symptoms of being extremely sensitive to both natural and artificial light at just three months old. Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a life-altering genetic condition characterised by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV is in sunlight, most artificial lighting and even lightning. Unless patients with XP are protected from UV, their skin and eyes may be severely damaged and this can lead to cancer. XP is an extremely rare hereditary condition with less than 100 cases in the UK. About 30 per cent of people with XP also develop neurological abnormalities which can include hearing loss and loss of mobility. There is no cure for XP, but much can be done to prevent and treat some of the problems it causes. These include protection from UV, including total daylight avoidance, specialised clothing and sunscreens. People with XP must also undergo frequent skin, eye and neurological examinations and have prompt removal of cancerous tissue. Source: Teddington Trust . His eyes and skin were worst affected and he developed severe abnormal burns. After initially assuming he was suffering from allergies a number of hospital visits and tests at St Thomas' hospital in London later revealed he had XP. Eddison's family said that it was a common misconception that having XP simply meant keeping out of direct sunlight. Mrs Miller, said: 'UV is present during all daylight hours and danger is still present indoors, with UV rays emitted by many sources of artificial lighting.' She added that the family looks forward to the clocks going back. 'During the summer I calculated that Eddison and I spent less than 24 hours outside in six weeks so obviously that's an extremely challenging time of year,' she said. 'But the minute the clocks go back we get so much more time outside - it's wonderful. 'I know Eddison is going to face many challenges in his life but it is our job as parents to make sure he gets as much out of life as possible.' Following the diagnosis Eddison's aunt Rebecca Stewart from Cushnie, Aberdeenshire set up a fundraising group called the Teddington Trust. Overwhelmed by the support received by the Trust, Eddison's family decided they would build on its success and try and help others with the rare disorder. Now they have launched their own set of teddy bears and books and hope their 'Little Ted' products can be sent to all the estimated affected 300 children in the world. Mrs Miller, said: 'We looked for ways to help educate Eddison in understanding his condition, and we immediately looked for appropriate reading that might help us find the words to explain this. 'Eddison loved the initial story I wrote, and really engaged with it so before long I started thinking of further additions to this and a small series of 'Little Ted' stories emerged. Eddison's parents say their goal is to help him live his life like a normal child. Here he is pictured with parents Nicola and Andrew and brother Raife . Eddison is pictured being slathered with factor 50 sunblock by mother Nicola. Mrs Miller said: 'He is just a normal little boy. He loves getting messy in his sandpit, playing on his bike or with his little brother Raife' 'We have set ourselves a goal to provide a copy free of charge to all children within our reach around the world affected by XP.' The illustrator of the book, Michael Howdon, said: 'I feel very privileged to be a part of the Teddington project; it's fantastic to work on a book that will help children across the world, it has been a very rewarding experience.' A spokesman for Parkers Design & Print, who are printing the book, added: 'Receiving the book and teddy that the Teddington Trust have so lovingly and expertly created from scratch, could make a massive impact on the children who suffer from XP and their supportive families.

"Three priests and a religious education teacher have been arrested  over the alleged abuse of altar boys by a Catholic paedophile ring in Spain. The investigation was launched after one alleged victim wrote to Pope Francis claiming he was molested by a priest around ten years ago. Francis said he felt 'great pain' after learning of the allegations but insisted that 'the truth is the truth and we should not hide it.' He said he personally called the man, now 24, to offer his support and wrote to the Archbishop of Granada, Francisco Javier Martinez, urging him to launch an investigation. The Archbishop of Granada, Francisco Javier Martinez (purple skullcap) lies prostrate with other priests in front of cathedral's high altar to ask forgiveness for alleged sexual abuse committed in the diocese. Three priests and a religious teacher have been arrested in Spain after a former altar boy claims he was abused . The Pope says he wrote to the Archbishop of Granada, Francisco Javier Martinez (purple skullcap), to urge him to launch an investigation into the claims that a former altar boy was molested by a priest (not pictured) The group allegedly drew boys into their sphere of influence by taking them on as altar boys or assistants before molesting them. A Granada judge is reportedly targeting 10 priests and two lay people, although only four have been arrested so far. As they began appearing in court today, a second ex-altar boy filed a police report alleging he had also been abused, it was reported by The Local, which cited Spanish newspaper El País. The four men were reportedly arrested at a chalet owned by the alleged head of the ring on Monday. Officers confiscated two computers in the property but found contents had been deleted, it was claimed. A police van containing a priest arrives at Granada's Court after being arrested on suspicion of child abuse . Speaking after returning to the Vatican from Strasbourg yesterday, he said the allegations were causing him 'great pain... but the truth is the truth and we should not hide it.' The three Catholic priests and the teacher were arrested in Granada on Monday. It was not clear when the man, now 24, had written to the Pope. But investigations into the case started 'some time ago', Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters, without giving further details. 'Received news with great pain': Pope Francis said he personally called the alleged victim who claims he was molested by a priest around ten years ago when he was 14 . The Pope said he told the man to 'go straight to the bishop tomorrow' after receiving the letter. He added: 'I wrote to the bishop and told him to start an investigation. 'I received this news with great pain, very great pain, but the truth is the truth and we should not hide it.' Pope Francis has promised a policy of zero tolerance for sexual abuse of minors by clerics after church scandals in several countries over many years. However, groups representing victims say he has not done enough. The Vatican said earlier this year that between 2004 and 2013, it had defrocked about 850 priests who had been accused of sexual abuse of minors.","Former altar boy claims he was molested by priest around ten years ago .

"A new debate has broken out between some of the world's top Shakespeare experts over whether the playwright's sonnets prove he was attracted to men. Sir Brian Vickers, a visiting professor at University College London, began the row by condemning a book review which suggested Sonnet 116 appears in a 'primarily homosexual context'. In a letter to the Times Literary Supplement, he said the claim was 'anachronistic' because scholars now accept there were forms of rhetoric that allowed men to express love without implying sexual attraction. Professor Sir Brian Vickers started the debate over playwright William Shakespeare's (pictured) sexuality after condemning a book review which suggested Sonnet 116 appears in a 'primarily homosexual context' He also said that any attempt to find biographical information in the sonnets was doomed because Shakespeare was a professional who wrote under the identity of a 'poet-persona'. Fellow academics have since hit back at Mr Vickers' comments, accusing him of promoting 'one of the great fallacies of modern Shakespeare criticism'. Scholar Arthur Freeman, who described himself as a 'friendly acquaintance' of Mr Vickers when responding to him via the letters page, accused him of introducing 'presuppositions that many of us would question, if not reject out of hand'. He wrote: 'I cannot think of any responsible editor ... who would dismiss the premise of homosexual, as well as heterosexual passion pervading [the sonnets]. 'Why should Shakespeare alone be thought so committed to the ""negative capability"" of his dramatic craft that all his most personal writings are treated as potentially artificial? 'And even if we insist on regarding the sonnets, wholly or in part, as a kind of long-term dramatic narrative ... why on earth would Shakespeare choose so often to impersonate a pathetically ageing, balding, lame and vulnerable bisexual suitor, abjectly whingeing about rejection and betrayal — unless the self-humiliation that surfaces again and again through these particulars were both genuine and cathartic?' Love: The Bard (Joseph Fiennes) with his mistress Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in the 1998 blockbuster film Shakespeare in Love. When he first falls in love with her, she is dressed as a boy to act on stage . There are long-standing debates over whether the poet was gay or bisexual. Pictured: The Globe Theatre . Another academic, who wrote under the name Professor Wells, also responded to the letter, pointing out that Shakespeare used at least one sonnet to woo Anne Hathaway. He said: 'When a poet whose name is William writes poems of anguished and unabashed sexual frankness which pun on the word ""will"" — 13 times in [Sonnet] No 135 ... it is not unreasonable to conclude that he may be writing from the depths of his own experience.' Let me not to the marriage of true minds . Admit impediments. Love is not love . Which alters when it alteration finds, . Or bends with the remover to remove: . O no; it is an ever-fixed mark, . That looks on tempests, and is never shaken; . It is the star to every wandering bark, . Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks . Within his bending sickle's compass come; . Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, . But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, . I never writ, nor no man ever loved. Mr Vickers responded by saying he could not stop people from speculating, adding: 'Thought is free. 'But if you fix these codes and then say that his 126 poems are like this, then people stop reading them as poems. They read them as biographical documents, looking for imputed sexuality.' He said there was 'no bad blood' but has written a second letter in which he claims Professor Wells has too much insight into Shakespeare's motives. 'Such figments of the critic's imagination not only produce quantities of waste paper but ... are inimical to the proper reading of poetry,' he said. The row is the latest debate over the sexuality of the playwright. The first edition of his sonnets were dedicated to a 'Mr W H', whose identity has never been proven - leading to claims it could have been a male lover. The most likely candidates were often thought to have been his friends Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, or William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. Oscar Wilde explored a different theory, writing a fictional 1889 story about whether it could be a cross-dressing boy actor called Willie Hughes - and the same person as the 'fair youth' of the sonnets. That could also help explain punning references to the name 'Will', it was claimed. Although there are few references to anything other than noble love, some sonnets appear more explicit than others. Sonnet 20 is largely interpreted as being dedicated to a man, declaring: 'A woman's face with nature's own hand painted / Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion.' In 2012, Shakespearean actor Sir Ian McKellen boldly announced that there was absolutely 'no doubt' the bard was bisexual. In 2012, Shakespearean actor Sir Ian McKellen (pictured) boldly announced that there was absolutely 'no doubt' the playwright preferred sex with men. He  came to his conclusion after studying the poet's work . McKellen said Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice (the film version is pictured) referenced homosexuality . The Lord of the Rings star said he was adamant Shakespeare preferred sex with men even though he was married with children. The 75-year-old acclaimed thespian said he came to his conclusion after studying the English poet's work. At the time, he said: 'I'd say Shakespeare slept with men. 'The Merchant of Venice, centering on how the world treats gays as well as Jews, has a love triangle between an older man, younger man and a woman. 'And the complexity in his comedies with cross-dressing and disguises is immense. 'Shakespeare obviously enjoyed sex with men as well as women.' It is widely accepted that Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway when he was 18. Six months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, who was baptised on May 26, 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised on February 2, 1585. Speculation: Edward II relied on male favourites . Oscar Wilde called gay attraction 'the love that dare not speak its name', and that's one of the reasons why it has sparked so many debates - it just isn't written down. Instead of the modern references to same-sex love found in everything from poems to EastEnders, authors danced around the subject and rarely made their intentions clear. Even in the early 1900s gay authors such as E M Forster and Christopher Isherwood censored themselves, only releasing full accounts towards the end of their lives - and in the case of Forster's Maurice, after they were dead. Renaissance England is more complicated. Society 500 years ago had more fluid ideas about gender, with cross-dressing actors and a more lavish, flamboyant dress sense for men. That makes it more difficult for scholars to work out whether authors were talking about sexual attraction, or just love between friends. Christopher Marlowe's 1593 play about Edward II examined the king's relationship with his 'favourite' Piers Gaveston, never spelling out long-held rumours that the pair went further than friendship. But there are strong hints as his wife Isabella proclaims: 'He'll ever dote on Gaveston; And so am I for ever miserable.' And the king is killed with a red-hot poker, which Medieval writers later claimed was inserted into his anus as an act of retribution. Renaissance authors were also reliant on Greek texts, which had very different ideas about gay sex than those which are discussed today. Sex between older and younger men - 'pederasty' - was common in Ancient Greece, but homosexuality was not seen as a permanent state of mind. Instead it was seen as a temporary relationship, of a different type to that between a man and a woman, which came to an end when the younger man matured and went out to find a wife.","New debate between academics over sexuality of William Shakespeare .

Her 33-year-old partner, who was unidentified in the report read by CNN, allegedly told police they bought the firearm as they feared mass violence after the grand jury announces its verdict on the Michael Brown shooting. Seven men and five women have been deliberating whether to indict white officer Darren Wilson for three months. With the verdict anticipated for Monday morning, law enforcement has issued police with grenades, erected barricades around the justice center, and enlisted almost 100 FBI officers to line the streets. According to Miss Campbell's boyfriend, the victim had been waving the gun around, joking that she was 'ready for Ferguson', CNN reported. Ducking his head to get out of the firing line, the man claims he accidentally swerved and hit the car in front.

Despite calls for calm from Michael Brown's mother and President Barack Obama, attorney Benjamin Crump has revealed the family does not trust the procedure, which could see Officer Wilson avoid trial. 'The process is completely unfair,' Crump told ABC News. He added: 'I have no doubt if they were to indict the police officer, he would be guaranteed his full constitutional rights of innocent until proven guilty.

St Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch called for a jury - made up of nine white and three black people to reflect the racial make up of the county - to decide whether Officer Wilson should be charged. Following evidence from Officer Wilson, forensic pathologists and witnesses, the panel will have to decide whether Wilson intentionally violated Brown's civil rights by fatally shooting him. Crump said: 'I just think this is process is unlike anything I've ever seen in my 20 years of practice. We don't think it's fair. 'If this prosecutor says ... we're not going to recommend any charges, that's different from anything he's done in his past 28 years with grand juries.' He added: 'Why can't it be equal justice? Why can't we have the same process?' Last month, legal experts told MailOnline the charge is more complex and difficult to prove than a murder or manslaughter charge. Young and old took to the streets of Ferguson last night to show their support in the case of  Michael Brown . 'Racism': Protesters accuse the county police of creating a racial divide in the majority black suburb . Devastated: Daily tributes are paid to shrines for Michael Brown who allegedly had his hands up when he died . Life goes on: A group of boys break dance near the Michael Brown memorial in Ferguson, Missouri . Safety measures: Officials have erected these barricades around the justice center . Peter Joy, a professor at the Washington University of Law in St Louis, told MailOnline the charge of civil rights abuse is a much higher standard than murder or manslaughter, as the 12 jury members will have to be certain Wilson intended to violate Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. 'The civil rights abuses are even harder to prove than an underlying criminal conviction. The federal government does not step in to pursue a civil rights conviction unless they believe it was an intentional abuse. 'There are some criminal charges that don't involve that kind of mental state, like murder. 'For example anger. They can be guilty of acting knowingly and recklessly, but it is different to intentionally violating a civil right.' As a result, he said, they will need forensic evidence of damage to the car to disprove Wilson's account if they are to find him guilty. Duke University law professor James Coleman Jr told MailOnline an innocent verdict would 'totally undermine the St Louis criminal justice system'. 'If a grand jury accepts that every shot he fired at that kid was in self-defense that simply is not plausible,' he said. Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden has urged protesters to refrain from violence, and President Obama has called for calm. Obama added that he has not ruled out a trip to Ferguson following the announcement of the jury's verdict.","Woman named by police as Becca Campbell, 26, 'had bought the gun for defense'

"In an Australian and possibly global first a shopping centre in Melbourne has opened a 'quiet room' for people who have autism. The 'sensory soothing place' where children and adults on the autism spectrum can go to calm down was officially launched in conjunction with Victorian autism organisation Amaze on Tuesday at Northland Shopping Centre in Preston. The room's design is very plain with pastel colours, soft lighting and limited noise and smells to combat the 'sensory overload' people with autism often encounter when they go to shopping centres. Nicole Antonopoulos and her four-year-old son Greg, who has autism, enjoy the new Quiet Room at Northland Shopping Centre in Melbourne . The room's design is very plain with pastel colours, soft lighting and limited noise and smells and it has booths for extra privacy . Amaze spokeswoman Fran Ludgate said the room would allow parents of children with autism, and also adults on the spectrum, to spend longer in the shopping centre without being forced to leave. 'A lot of people on the spectrum are hyper-sensitive to light or sound - if you're in a shopping centre you probably don't notice how noisy the background noise is,' Ms Ludgate said. 'If you have a child you want to take shopping with you they might have a meltdown, which is a bit like a tantrum but not the same because they can't control it. 'If that's the case you're not going to force them to stay in that environment.' Ms Ludgate said instead of parents having to 'bolt for home' to get away from shopping crowds, the Quiet Room provided a suitable place where they could take their kids to relax and calm down. The room is not a childcare facility and children must be supervised by an adult when inside. Special care was taken to make sure the room doesn't evoke any kind of emotion . The room is not a childcare facility and children must be supervised by an adult when inside . One in 100 schoolchildren have autism and an estimated 250,000 Australians are on the spectrum, including those who are undiagnosed, Ms Ludgate said. Ms Antonopoulos, who lives in nearby Thornbury and often shops at the centre, was invited to the room's launch . Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental condition which affects individuals in two main areas: impaired communication and social interaction. Ms Ludgate said that some schools had quiet rooms for children with autism but adding one to a shopping centre was an Australian first, and possibly a global first. Northland Shopping Centre retail manager Simone Dirckze, whose seven-year-old son Keenan is on the spectrum, said the building's contractors had donated materials and labour to set up the room free of charge. Ms Dirckze, 37, said special care was taken to make sure the room doesn't evoke any kind of emotion. 'We put in some booths in the room for extra privacy,' she said. 'It's not even just for kids on the spectrum it is a place for adults and teenagers as well.' She said her son has specific things that calm him down, like his iPad. 'He has specific sensory games that he plays so this room will give kids the ability to charge their games to play it for a little bit to regroup,' she said. The Quiet Room was unveiled by Darebin Mayor Gaetano Greco and Amaze CEO Fiona Sharkie. The room was opened to provide a place of respite for kids and adults on the spectrum, who can become overwhelmed by crowds, lights and noise in shopping centres .

"Tragic: Alexander Denk, 26, from Munich, was found eight days after he died in his room in Cardiff . A university student lay dead in his room for eight days until his worried family raised the alarm. Alexander Denk, 26, was living with eight University of Wales undergraduates in a shared house when he mysteriously died in early November. But he went undetected for more than a week until his family became concerned that they had not heard from him. Police forced their way into his locked room in Roath, Cardiff, on November 8 and found his body. The German-born student was last seen on October 31, an inquest heard. Due to the time lapse, pathologist Gareth Leopold said the circumstances of death were unclear. He told Cardiff Coroner's Court Mr Denk could have been a victim of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome. Drinking too much caffeine to stay awake could have also been a factor, Mr Leopold said, adding: 'Consuming a large amount of caffeine has been known to cause death by a condition called arrhythmia, in which the heart beats too fast.' Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, known in medical circles as Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome, is the term given to an unexplained heart attack in healthy adults, also linked to so-called 'cot deaths'. Alexander moved to Cardiff from Munich last year to study for his masters degree in international business management at the University of South Wales. Undetected: Mr Denk lived in a house in Roath, Cardiff, with other students . Unexplained: Pathologist Gareth Leopold said the delay meant the cause of death is difficult to determine . Hard worker: His father, Raimund, paid tribute to Alexander, who worked hard on his MA at the University of Wales and loved sports . His father Raimund last saw his son at home in Munich in August, and spoke to him on the phone on October 29. He said: 'I knew he had a lot of pressure in relation to his studies and I told him he should take care of himself. He was very ambitious.' Coroner Thomas Atherton recorded an open verdict.","Alexander Denk, 26, lived in shared house in Cardiff with 8 undergraduates .

"Christopher Nolan has said the sound was mixed in an 'impressionistic way' in Interstellar . Interstellar director Christopher Nolan has reassured moviegoers that there's no need to worry if they find dialogue in his three-hour space epic practically inaudible - because that is exactly what he intended. The British director responded to concerns about poor sound quality in the £105 million blockbuster by praising cinemas for presenting the film just the way he wanted. Audiences have complained about drowned out dialogue and muffled conversations, with an overbearing soundtrack that obscures major plot points. But what they do not appear to have realized is that they were experiencing the 'impressionistic way' sound was mixed in the movie. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Nolan explained that he felt this 'unusual approach' to the use of sound was right for an 'experimental film' such as Interstellar. 'I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue,' he said. 'Clarity of story, clarity of emotions - I try to achieve that in a layered way using all the different things at my disposal - picture and sound.' As the space epic took the box office by storm, one commentator Tweeted: '#INTERSTELLAR premiere: can't hear > 50% of dialogue inc major plot points. baffling sound mix decisions by Chris Nolan.' Another Twitter user wrote: 'Very difficult to understand dialogue when score swelled in @Interstellar at @IMAX screening tonight.' One cinema in Rochester, New York, even went as far as to tape up notices around the box confirming that its equipment was functioning properly and this was how the movie was actually intended to sound. Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter that he likes to hear how his movies sound in actual cinemas so he makes a point to visit six or seven theatres. One cinema in Rochester, New York, even went as far as to tape up notices around the box confirming that its equipment was functioning properly and this was how the movie was actually intended to sound . I like to hear it out where people are going to see it, not just in the cocoon of the dub stage,' he said. That is something I have done for years, because everything we are doing is intended to communicate something to the audience.' The director continued on to say that the movie theatres he has visited have been doing 'a terrific job in terms of presenting the film in the way I intended'. He added: 'Broadly speaking, there is no question when you mix a film in an unconventional way as this, you're bound to catch some people off guard, but hopefully people can appreciate the experience for what it's intended to be.'

"If you overindulged this Christmas and are looking to jump on the New Year diet bandwagon, our favourite A-list health guru is here to help. Health advocate Gwyneth Paltrow has unveiled a January detox meal plan, which she promises is 'warming, filling and doesn't feel like a sacrifice'. While the 41-year-old probably didn't shovel in as much stuffing and Christmas pudding as we did this festive season, she has joined forces with a nutritionist to create a healthy and cleansing meal plan. It's detox o'clock! Gwyneth Paltrow, an avid foodie, has unveiled a January detox menu, which she promises doesn't feel like a sacrifice . Writing on her site Goop, she says: 'You know we love a good detox here at goop, and this January is no exception. 'We created detox recipes that won't leave you feeling cold and hungry during the winter months, with guidance from Dr. Alejandro Junger, a specialist on the subject. 'We took to the test kitchen to create a three-day menu of detox recipes that are warming and filling and don't feel like a sacrifice. 'We then turned to Dr. Alejandro Junger for some info on how to best detox during the cold winter months. Dr. Junger contributed the warm shakes - the rest of the recipes are from the goop kitchen.' Hard at work: Gwyneth and her team joined forces with a nutritionist to create some healthy recipes for her Goop fans to enjoy . The menu advises detoxers to start the day with room temperature water and lemon, followed by a herbal tea and special shake. Lunch consists of either a balsamic miso root salad or chickpea or carrot soup (bread rolls not included, obviously). If you're feeling peckish in the afternoon, Gwyneth suggests snacking on walnut lentil pate or a handful of nuts before feasting on coconut poached salmon, quinoa stuffed squash or pan-steamed chicken and broccoli for dinner. 'Adjust the times to your schedule and the meals to your taste,' advises the actress. What, no carbs? Plenty of herbal teas, salads, soups and oily fish feature on Gwyneth's menu . Foodies will be delighted to hear that this winter detox is much less strict than ones Gwyneth and her team have created in the past. 'Our winter detox has looser guidelines and restrictions than ones we’ve done in the past but', she adds, 'here is what we’re avoiding: dairy, gluten, shellfish, anything processed (including all soy products), nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and eggplant), condiments, sugar, alcohol, caffeine and soda,' she writes.

"A New York teen with a new haircut says he started has day at school feeling good about himself but left shattered when his assistant principal decided to shave his head in the school cafeteria. Notre Dame High School student Lucas Hull said many of his fellow seniors were even there to see the haircut. 'Just having people watch and have that done to you,' Lucas, 17, began before having to stop and collect himself. 'It kind of felt humiliating and inhumane and you know, it kind of crushed my spirits for the day.' Notre Dame High School student Lucas Hull said many of his fellow seniors were even there to see the haircut . His assistant principal said he didn't care for his new look, and took the rest of his hair off with clippers in the cafeteria . 13 WHAM reports that he had just gotten a 'faux-hawk' the day before. While a mohawk would violate the school's policies, Lucas says he asked for permission before getting his hair cut. 'My brother had so much confidence in him that day, and he was just ready to face the world,' said sister Lauren Hull. While a mohawk would violate the school's policies, Lucas says he asked for permission before getting his hair cut . But when he got to school the assistant principal called him to the cafeteria and said he didn't approve of the look. 'He just said you have the choice to either go home or get it cut,' Hull. 'I thought it looked good and I felt good about it and then he started cutting and it felt really bad.' Mother Denise Hull said it was an over-the-top reaction meant to embarrass her son. Hull's mother said no one at Notre Dame High School even contacted here about the incident . The administration didn't even call her to tell her what was happening. 'What really upset me even more than the haircut is how much his feelings were hurt for what had happened,' she said. 'I mean here is a good kid.' She said that since the incident he has been emotionally scarred. Though they've made complaints they've only received a 'halfhearted apology.' The school has since released this statement: 'The assistant principal has since apologized to the student, his parents, and the school community for his error in judgment in cutting the student's hair in the student's homeroom before discussing the violation with the student's parents.' However no action will be taken to reprimand the administrator.","Notre Dame High School student Lucas Hull said he had gotten a faux-hawk cut after asking permission from the school .

"A network of female beggars on the streets of New York have been exposed as working together using young children to appeal for cash while refusing available city services for shelter and food. An investigation by NBC New York followed the group of at least nine women for one month, gathering footage that suggests they are not homeless and are even trading off the children among themselves to exploit donations from passers-by. The women sit separately on the busy streets and subways of Manhattan's bustling Midtown neighborhood, but videos secretly filmed over the course of a few weeks showed them meeting for lunch, shopping, sharing ice cream and talking among themselves. At night they take the subway together back to the same building in East New York, Brooklyn, NBC News reported. Scroll down for video . Scam: An NBC New York investigation has identified a group of women begging on the city's streets who do not appear to be homeless and are refusing services such as food and shelter, but taking cash . Exploitation: The women appear to use their children to appeal for more money from passers-by . Coordinated: The NBC study showed the women live in the same building in Brooklyn but sit on the streets during the day . Appeal: They use their children and signs to ask for money . Lucrative: NBC reports the women could receive numerous handouts in a matter of minutes . One woman said on-camera that she is a Romanian immigrant who lives in an apartment with her mother. There are various services offered by the city for struggling parents and or homeless people. George McDonald, who works for a nonprofit called The Doe Fund, which assists homeless people, said not only are the women turning down such services, they are risking the health of their children. The children would be taken from the women should someone call child services. 'This is a scam - a business,' McDonald told NBC. 'It’s a group of women who who trade off the same children. Friends: Footage taken from the streets shows that the female beggars know each other . Home: At night the women travel to Brooklyn together and appear to live in the same building . Shopping: The women are seen here checking out items on a street stand together . No comment: One woman refused an interview with NBC investigative reporter Melissa Russo .

Social service workers in the area told NBC the women tell have refused shelter and other support when approached in the past. Karen Freedman, who works with the group Lawyers for Children, said what the women appear to do be doing walks a fine line with the law.

"Hundreds of fake Frozen toys have been seized by trading standards officers as the must-have Elsa doll sells out across the UK. A haul of 1,960 knock off toys were seized at the Port of Dover in Kent - including 426 Frozen character dolls from the blockbuster Disney film, intended for the Christmas toy market. The fake toys - confirmed by Disney as counterfeit - included copies of Queen Elsa and Princess Anna dolls as people try to cash in on the demand for this Christmas' most popular toys. Hundreds of fake Frozen dolls have been prevented from entering the UK after  a huge consignment of knock off toys was seized at Dover Docks . Also captured were 3,000 sets of Christmas lights which were not properly insulated and could have caused electric shocks. Many stores, such as Tesco, Toys r Us and Argos, are struggling to keep up with demand for Frozen toys including the interactive Frozen Snow Glow Elsa who sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99. Many list the item, tipped to be the most in demand toy this Christmas, as unavailable while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves. Among the thousands of seized items were 1,960 toys, including 426 character dolls from the blockbuster Disney film intended for the Christmas toy market . Demand is so high that eBay entrepreneurs are cashing in by charging as much as £149.99- a mark-up of almost 160 per cent. The rest of the lorry load made up nearly 170,000 items and they are believed to have originated in China. It had been stopped by Border Force officers after containers were spotted and Trading Standards was alerted. Kent County Council trading standards manager Mark Rolfe said this week’s seizure was one of the biggest hauls ever confiscated. He said: “Not surprisingly, it was a very time-consuming task for our officers to go through the consignments and examine samples of every product. “Some of the items we seized were clearly potentially dangerous and likely to be aimed at the Christmas retail market. “We are pleased that we were able to protect the public from these shoddy goods and prevent any injuries they might have caused. The lorry's dangerous load, which also included 3,000 sets of Christmas lights which were not properly insulated and could have caused electric shocks, has been permanently seized by KCC Trading Standards . “Others were counterfeit, so purchasers would have been buying an inferior product to what they expected.” Sales of official dolls and merchandise linked to the Disney film are on course to hit all-time high for any movie franchise - overtaking the phenomenally successful Toy Story. With one raise of Elsa’s arm you can watch her snowflake necklace light up while it plays the hit song ‘Let it Go’ and her dress magically shines. And with a touch of her magical snowflake necklace, Elsa talks to her Frozen friends with 15 sounds and phrases. While Toy Story sales were driven by versions of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, it is the Frozen Snow Glow Elsa which is number one on wish lists this year. The current top five toy best-selling toys also includes a Frozen Ice Skating Elsa Doll, which is £29.99, and an interactive Frozen Toddler Doll for younger children at £39.99. The real deal: The authentic Frozen Snow Glow Elsa, retailing at £34.99, is tipped to be the most popular toy this Christmas . UK sales of all Frozen merchandise, from dressing up outfits to dolls and jigsaws, are put at £31million up until the week ending November 8, according to retail experts at The NPD Group. Global toys industry analyst for NPD, Frederique Tutt, said: “New items have been launched, production has been increased to meet demand, and sales are getting stronger. “We counted three Frozen dolls in the five best-selling toys last week alone. “If Frozen continues at this level until Christmas, not only will the license keep top spot and get the license of the year accolade but it will also beat the all-time record of Toy Story 3 - in 2010 - in terms of toy sales.” Sales of Frozen toys are set to hit an all-time high, outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released. While Toy Story merchandise was most popular with boys, Frozen is clearly a favourite for girls. The storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter. The film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion, while the song ‘Let it Go’ won an Oscar and became a social media phenomenon. Such is the demand for themed merchandise that there were reports of fights among women shoppers at the opening of a new Poundworld in Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales. And last week, police were called to a toy store in Dublin to calm shoppers who were battling to get hold of the sought-after Elsa doll.","Almost 2,000 fake toys were found in one of the biggest hauls ever confiscated .

"A leading British energy firm has come under fire for offering its new boss a £25million pay package. Helge Lund, who will take over as BG Group’s chief executive in March, will receive £12million in shares on top of a lavish remuneration package of up to £13million a year. The deal, by British Gas’s former oil and gas division, was condemned yesterday as ‘excessive and inflammatory’ by shareholders and business leaders. Helge Lund, pictured, will receive £12 million in shares a year on top of his £13 million pay package . Two major investment advice firms have criticised the move, and the Institute of Directors (IoD) launched a withering attack on the scale of the deal. In a highly unusual intervention, IoD director general Simon Walker said the arrangements ‘bring the whole of British business into disrepute’. He added: ‘It is excessive, inflammatory and contrary to the principles of good corporate governance. ‘This pay deal would do serious damage to the reputation of British business six months ahead of a general election and at a time when the reputation of UK plc is still suffering. ‘It is a red rag to the enemies of the free market.’ He also pointed out that the awards were out of kilter with the size of the company, because chief executives at much larger rivals – such as Shell and BP – have smaller pay packages. Two respected shareholder advisory groups – which provide guidance to investors on how to vote on technical issues – have come out in opposition to the deal. Institutional Shareholder Services, whose clients include major City fund managers, yesterday advised investors to oppose the move at next month’s meeting. And the Investment Management Association, another advisory firm, has issued a ‘red top’ alert – its most serious warning signal about corporate governance breaches. Top ten shareholder Legal & General has also criticised the deal, saying that allowing executives to negotiate additional rewards on top of established annual pay packages ‘opens up a can of worms’. Mr Lund, 52, was recruited from Norwegian oil firm Statoil where he was chief executive. Simon Walker, pictured, of the Institute of Directors described Mr Lund's package as 'excessive' He will not be able to take possession of his free shares for three years and will be barred from selling until he leaves the firm. One of BG Group’s top ten shareholders, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that investors were being put under pressure to support the deal. The firm has insisted it must spend money on hiring internationally in order to recruit the best talent. But the investor said shareholders are being ‘held to ransom’, because refusing to support the vote could see Mr Lund refuse to join the company. This would jeopardise BG Group’s future and lead to an immediate drop in its share price, the source added. Last night a spokesman for the company defended the pay package, saying: ‘We believe Helge Lund is the right person to lead BG Group. ‘His proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry. ‘The shareholder vote on Helge Lund’s pay is in line with the letter and spirit of corporate governance legislation.’ The firm was created in 1997 when British Gas split into Centrica, which deals with domestic supplies, and BG Group, which manages oil and gas fields and exploration.","Helge Lund will receive £12 million in shares on top of £13 million pay .

Clearly upset with the officers' misconduct, the Facebook member uses his phone to film the unlawful act, hoping to name and shame the officers involved in the incident. 'Nice place for lunch,' the man filming the video says, taunting the officers with his camera. Officers were caught out by a disgruntled member of the public who decided to shame the two cops online by posting a video of the whole thing on the Facebook group 'Victoria Police Corruption' The video, which was taken on Hawthorn road Caulfield North, has already garnered over 230,000 views since it was uploaded 21 hours ago . 'Parked in a No Standing, you’d give us a ticket for that wouldn't you.' he says, repeating it when he gets no response from the officers. The police officers give the man the cold shoulder, not acting up for the camera. 'Wouldn't you constable' the man says, referring to the parking ticket,  as he zooms in on the officers name tag. The home video clearly shows the two officers sitting at an outdoor table eating breakfast, having parked their car within walking distance to their table, in a No Standing zone . 'Did you get my name?,' the constable asks, as the man decides to turn off his recording device as the policeman answers him back. As the Daily Mail understands, police vehicles may park in No Standing zones in emergency situations. Police officers also need to be in close proximity to their car, should an emergency arise. The man used his video phone to name and shame the police officers, zooming in on their name tags and asking them probing questions about their misconduct . Clearly upset with the officers' misconduct, the Facebook member uses his phone to film the unlawful act, hoping to name and shame the officers involved in the incident . The Facebook group 'Victoria Police Corruption' states that they are: 'An open platform for documenting police news, misconduct, brutality and abuse of power' 'The practice of Police investigating Police needs to end' the page says. Over 1,200 people commented on the post, with the majority of commenters siding with Victoria Police in this situation. Users of the Facebook page 'Victoria Police Corruption' had their say on the video . One commenter said: 'emergency vehicles can park where ever they want. they won't be fined. and they shouldn't. get a life and learn the rules before you slander people whos career is to to help ungrateful people like the original filmer when its their turn to cry for help. dont bite the hand that feeds you!' Many commenters sided with the police in this situation . Another member also sided with the police, telling the video-man that they should be left to have their breakfast in peace. 'This police officer should be commended for having such patience with a complete flog when he's just trying to eat his lunch. The exemption is not a privilege, they need to be near their car in case they're called for an emergency. I'm happy I don't have to worry about my job when I'm on my lunch break, have some respect for those that put their life on the line to keep you safe,' she said. One commenter said she was happy she didn't have to be on-call during her lunch brake and said the video-man should be ashamed of himself . However one Facebook user believed the police officers should be setting a good example to other road users. 'Yes you are all right. It's an emergency vehicle and they need to be close at all times. It's understandable he needs his car 5 feet away while he eats so how about put there desks on the footpath too. Wake up, they are taking advantage of their positions because they think they are higher in the food chain. How can you respect someone who can't set an example to be respected.' he said. However. not all Facebook users were as understanding, with one commenter suggesting the police should set a good example to other road users . Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia, that all employees are 'required to park police vehicles legally at all times, unless exempt from doing so.' 'An exemption is available under the Road Rules Victoria Regulation Act 2009 for drivers of emergency vehicles.

"A dying mother who has been told she has just 18 months to live would have been saved if she started getting cancer treatment five months earlier, a court heard. Katie Maytum, now 35, is suing the Welsh NHS for £750,000, claiming surgeons ignored official guidelines and refused her treatment because she was too young. The mother-of-two, who has terminal breast cancer, told the High Court in Cardiff that she was forced to wait five and half months before being seen by a specialist. She has now been told by doctors that she has only less than two years to live, robbing her of the chance to see her children grow up. Scroll down for video . Katie Maytum, (left) pictured outside the High Court in Cardiff, is suing the NHS after surgeon Vummiti Murali-Krishnan (right) downgraded the mother-of-two's cancer referral from urgent to routine because she was under 35 . A cancer expert told the High Court in Cardiff that by causing a five-month delay, surgeons at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board had denied Ms Maytum life-saving treatment. Consultant surgeon Frederick Skidmore said: 'My opinion is that she would have been cured of the cancer on the balance of probabilities. 'Looking at the results of 20,000 women of a similar age, we find 90% of those women are cured of the disease if treated at the earliest opportunity.' But a breast cancer surgeon, for the defence, said Ms Maytum's cancer was so aggressive that it would not have responded to treatment. Ms Maytum is now suffering from terminal breast canceras and has been told by doctors that she has only 18 months to live . Nigel Bundred, a professor of surgical oncology, said: 'The fact she relapsed despite all the surgery and most high-tech therapy available shows she is in the small percentage who would have died.' He added: 'If the key doesn't fit the lock then the door won't open and the patient isn't cured. It's black and white.' Professor Bundred also told the court Ms Maytum could have lessened her chances of survival because she took the pill during treatment. He said that taking the contraceptive pill could have affected her body's ability to fight against tumours and risk complications in surgery. 'If I saw somebody on the pill I would ask them to stop it because it increases the risk of blood clots at surgery. I'd ask them to stop it for that reason alone,' he said. 'If I stopped the pill then by the time that person came for surgery the tumour would have stopped growing.' Ms Maytum was 31 when she went to her GP after noticing a lump in her breast in July 2010. He sent an 'urgent referral' to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, but surgeon Vummiti Murali-Krishnan downgraded her to 'routine' and classed the case as not urgent because she was under 35. Ms Maytum finally had  chemotherapy in 2011 and was cancer-free for several years until a lump appeared in her neck in April this year. She was told by doctors the cancer had spread to her bones and she had only 18 months to live. A renowned cancer expert told the hearing NHS surgeons at the Princess of Wales Hospital (pictured) missed the chance to save Ms Maytum 'by a mile' A renowned cancer expert later told the hearing NHS surgeons missed the chance to save Ms Maytum 'by a mile'. Research has found that the pill is found to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, particularly in younger women. This risk only returns back to normal after ten years of stopping its use. It may also increase the risk of developing cervical cancer. But the combined pill is found to actually lower the risk of certain other cancers such as ovarian, womb and bowel cancer. Professor Justin Stebbing, who has published more than 500 papers on the disease, branded claims she would not have been cured if she had received treatment earlier as 'ridiculous and preposterous'. Prof Stebbing said a crucial 'window of opportunity' to treat Ms Maytum was 'missed by a mile'. He strongly rejected claims that Ms Maytum would not have survived treatment because her cancer was so aggressive. He said: 'Katie is not a chemotherapy resistant individual and you can just look at her to know that. 'With women we know you have to act more quickly because the breast cancer is a lot more aggressive. 'To say that Katie would have died on the same day is just ridiculous - it's just the most preposterous thing I've heard in a semi-academic forum.' Prof Stebbing, who sees up to 30 cancer patients a day, added: 'This cancer was allowed to grow for a great many months. When you have a young woman with a lump in her breast you have a window of opportunity and that was missed by a mile here. 'As far as I can tell 'common sense doesn't matter, she was going to die anyway so why bother treating her in the first place?' is what I heard a lot of this morning.' Ms Maytum, of Maesteg, South Wales, is due to marry her partner next month. Her children Megan, 14, and Zac, 10, will be by her side at the service. The hearing continues.

"Researchers have used Harry Potter to reveal that magic that happens inside our brain as we read. They scanned the brains of people reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and were able to work out which areas of the brain were being used. The team identified parts of the brain responsible for parsing sentences, determining the meaning of words and and understanding characters relationships. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of eight people as they read a chapter ofHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (pictured). The team devised a technique in which people see one word of a passage every half second — or four words for every two-second fMRI scan. For each word, they identified 195 detailed features — everything from the number of letters in the word to its part of speech. They then used a machine learning algorithm to analyze the activation of each cubic centimeter of the brain for each four-word segment. Bit by bit, the algorithm was able to associate certain features with certain regions of the brain, Wehbe said. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Departmentperformed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of eight people as they read a chapter of a Potter book. They then analyzed the scans, cubic millimeter by cubic millimeter, for every four-word segment of that chapter. The result was the first integrated computational model of reading, identifying which parts of the brain are responsible for such subprocesses as parsing sentences, determining the meaning of words and understanding relationships between characters. 'At first, we were skeptical of whether this would work at all,' Tom Mitchell of CMU said. Analyzing multiple subprocesses of the brain at the same time is unprecedented in cognitive neuroscience. 'But it turned out amazingly well and now we have these wonderful brain maps that describe where in the brain you're thinking about a wide variety of things.' The research, published in the online journal PLOS ONE,  was able to predict fMRI activity for novel text passages with sufficient accuracy to tell which of two different passages a person was reading with 74 percent accuracy. Leila Wehbe and Mitchell said the model is still inexact, but might someday be useful in studying and diagnosing reading disorders, such as dyslexia, or to track the recovery of patients whose speech was impacted by a stroke. It also might be used by educators to identify what might be giving a student trouble when learning a foreign language. 'If I'm having trouble learning a new language, I may have a hard time figuring out exactly what I don't get,' Mitchell said. 'When I can't understand a sentence, I can't articulate what it is I don't understand. 'But a brain scan might show that the region of my brain responsible for grammar isn't activating properly, or perhaps instead I'm not understanding the individual words.' Researchers at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere have used fMRI scans to identify activation patterns associated with particular words or phrases or even emotions. Researchers were able to pinpoint the areas of the brain that deal with different aspects of . But these have always been tightly controlled experiments, with only one variable analyzed at a time. The experiments were unnatural, usually involving only single words or phrases, but the slow pace of fMRI — one scan every two seconds — made other approaches seem unfeasible. The team devised a technique in which people see one word of a passage every half second — or four words for every two-second fMRI scan. For each word, they identified 195 detailed features — everything from the number of letters in the word to its part of speech. They then used a machine learning algorithm to analyze the activation of each cubic centimeter of the brain for each four-word segment. Bit by bit, the algorithm was able to associate certain features with certain regions of the brain, Wehbe said. 'The test subjects read Chapter 9 of Sorcerer's Stone, which is about Harry's first flying lesson,' she noted. 'It turns out that movement of the characters — such as when they are flying their brooms — is associated with activation in the same brain region that we use to perceive other people's motion. Similarly, the characters in the story are associated with activation in the same brain region we use to process other people's intentions.' Exactly how the brain creates these neural encodings is still a mystery, they said, but it is the beginning of understanding what the brain is doing when a person reads. 'It's sort of like a DNA fingerprint — you may not understand all aspects of DNA's function, but it guides you in understanding cell function or development,' Mitchell said. 'This model of reading initially is that kind of a fingerprint.'","Researchers studied people reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .

"Paying toll charges is an unfortunate reality of life on the road that most drivers just learn to deal with. But, as these pictures show, some motorists are so desperate to cling onto their loose change that almost anything is fair game for dodging the collectors- who often ask as little as 26 cents. Everyday tactics for avoiding number plate-tracking cameras including bending the plate back or trying to change the numbers by smearing on grease. Sneaky: A motorcyclist reaches back to obscure his numberplate - a dangerous move that will save him between 26 cents and a dollar and a half .

Bent back: Some drivers take the less eye-catching decision to bend their plates to an angle where they can't be read by cameras . But truly inventive - or desperate - road users have gone even further, leaning out the trunks of their cars, or even standing on top of them to obscure the plates. Motorcylists put their balance to the test, either reaching back to put their hand over the registrations plates, or even lifting up their legs and obscuring the letters and digits with their feet. New examples of the sneaky tricks were brought to light by an NBC6 investigation into the ongoing problem in southern Florida. An accident? Duct tape and innocent-looking smears have also been employed as means of getting out of charges . Not recommended: In the most extreme example pictures, a man clings to the top of a car and obscures the plates with his legs . Dirty trick: Another driver obscured his registration with semi-opaque plastic - while artfully-placed grease turned two zeroes into figures of 8 . According to Sunpass, the organization which operates tolling in the area, the company loses out on $36million every year because of drivers who skip the charges. NBC6 reporters rode along with Florida's highway patrol as they tried to crack down on the problem - though apparent offenders were reluctant to explain themselves. According to officers, truck drivers are the most frequent offenders, as they pass the toll plazas several times per day and can expect their bills to reach hundreds of dollars a month. Getting caught out dodging a toll can mean a fine of at least $135, and repeated offences can lose motorists their license. But the threat seems to do little to deter the hundreds of drivers, finding ever-more-inventive ways to beat the system.

Julia said: 'We had been looking for a US born, well raised and healthy baby sloth suitable for children's education for four years. Baby Alia is also friends with Boomeroo, the couple's kangaroo . 'It just so happened that the first one available to us was born just after I became pregnant with Alia, and ready for a new home just as Alia was born. 'Alia was two weeks late in arriving, and there was only one day we were able to have Daisy travel to us due to the weather warming up for the summer. 'So I believe that the events happened as God planned them. I guess he knew we could handle the work of two babies at the same time, and that it would be great for them to grow up together. Cute as can be: When the pair nap together, Daisy allows Alia to nuzzle into her soft fur . Jason and Julia are huge proponents of educating children about animal and environmental conservation . 'When Alia and Daisy sit next to each other, Daisy sniffs Alia while Alia nuzzles into Daisy's soft fur. They are so sweet together. 'They even wear the same coloured flower head pieces in their hair. Boomeroo, our kangaroo still comes into my office and hangs out with us too. 'Boomeroo walks up to Alia, puts her hands on her and sniffs her as Alia chuckles.' Mum Julia said: 'There are challenges to being an author with many animals, as well as two new babies' 'The sloth and baby have been growing up together and working alongside mummy as I write my books' Together Julia and Jason also conduct school and community events in Panama and Peru during conservation and missions trips to spread the love of nature and reading. Daisy is now accompanying them and Alia on their school visits and it is during their time together on these trips that Alia and Daisy have grown closer. Julia said: 'There are challenges to being an author with many animals, as well as two new babies that just want to be held and snuggled. 'But the challenges are also joys that allow me to teach my own child to love and care for the natural world. 'The sloth and baby have been growing up together, taking walks together, and working alongside mummy as I write my books and travel to schools. 'It may sound like an unusual situation, but the look on the school children's faces as they meet their favorite book characters in real life are priceless. 'These are memories that will stick with those children for a lifetime.'","Baby Alia was introduced to Daisy when she was just two days old .

"Liverpool are hoping to agree a deal with Burnley for Danny Ings that would avoid the need for a tribunal when his contract ends in June. Burnley have insisted Ings will not be leaving before the window closes but Liverpool are eager to sign the England Under 21 international. Real Sociedad are also determined to land the 22-year-old and they would only have to pay £300,000 in compensation if they waited until the summer. Liverpool are keen to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings during this transfer window . The Reds do not want to become embroiled in a tribunal for the out-of-contract striker . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is a firm admirer of Ings and rather than run the risk of missing out, the Reds are prepared to thrash out an agreement with Burnley. The initial idea was for Liverpool to agree a deal with Burnley and then loan Ings back for the remainder of the season but that would have been a contravention of Premier League rules. Burnley issued a statement on Friday saying that Ings was not for sale as the club focused their efforts on staying in the Barclays Premier League but there may yet be a twist. If Liverpool are to do any business, it is most likely to be for Ings. There will be some minor outgoings, such as youngsters Sheyi Ojo and Ryan McLaughlin, but no major departures, at this point, are anticipated.","Burnley forward Danny Ings still interesting Liverpool .

This is because many people who develop symptoms of COPD do not get medical help because they often dismiss their symptoms as a 'smoker's cough'.. COPD affects more men than women, although rates in women are increasing. The study's lead author Doctor Corinne Hanson said: 'Diet is a potentially modifiable risk factor in the development and progression of many diseases, and there is evidence that diet plays a role in both the development and clinical features of COPD. 'This study aimed to evaluate that association.'

"The steep rise in the number of 'ultra-rich' people living in San Francisco  this year, has seen the city push ahead of Los Angeles to become California's hub for multi-millionaires. According to a report on 'America's Ultra-Wealthy Population', the number of individuals in San Francisco worth $30million or more jumped by 12 per cent to 5,460 in 2014. In Los Angles, the figure climbed by a relatively modest four per cent from 4,945  to 5,135 ultra-high net worth individuals, leaving the city lagging slightly behind its northern neighbor. The number of individuals in San Francisco worth $30million or more jumped by 12 per cent to 5,460 in 2014 . But although California led the nation as the state with the most ultra-rich residents, neither of its metropolises could beat New York City as a hub for super-rich individuals. With 8,655 ultra-wealthy residents - up eight per cent from a year earlier - New York City was found to be the preferred home for high net worth individuals not just in America but across the world. Although no reason was given for San Francisco to overtake Los Angeles in terms of wealthy residents, it seems the city's booming tech industry - which appears to be turning the city into a playground for the wealthy - may hold the key. The survey by Wealth X, working with the Swiss bank UBS, also noted that the number of ultra-rich in the United States climbed 7.6 per cent to 34,789 in the past year, with their collective wealth increasing 7.3 per cent. In Los Angles - previously California's hub of multimillionaires - the number of ultra-high net worth individuals climbed by a relatively modest four per cent from 4,945 to 5,135 in 2014 . Florida's ultra-high net worth population grew by more than 10 per cent over the past year, due to strong growth in the state's financial and real estate sectors. It now has an extra 500 individuals with a net worth of $30million or more. Michigan also put on a good show in 2014, adding close to 200 new ultra-high net worth individuals to its population, thanks to rising confidence in the state’s economic outlook.

"Images of lonely polar bears seemingly stranded on chunks of drifting ice have become one of the defining images of global warming. Now scientists warn that a quarter of Canadian polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps. Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food. Scientists warn that a quarter of Canadian polar bears (pictured) could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps. Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food and mate . Biologists from the University of Alberta believe that as summers get warmer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - islands off the North American continent and Greenland – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year. This means that by 2100, each polar bear population in the Archipelago may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea, which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate. Projected global warming would adversely affect one tenth of their habitat, which is being damaged by man-made pollution, according to the study. It found that sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering the physical characteristics of marine ecosystems. Biologists from the University of Alberta believe that as summers get warmer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (mapped) - islands off the North American continent and Greenland – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year . By 2100, each polar bear population in the Archipelago may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea, which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate. A mother and her cubs are pictured . Carbon emissions from human activities must be cut to net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Other greenhouse gases, such as methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) must reach net zero by the end of the century . Emissions need to peak within a decade, with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century. Delaying taking action until after 2020 will lead to higher costs and increased risks to our way of life. Predatory animals are vulnerable to these changes in sea ice conditions because a smaller amount of sea ice lessens animals' opportunities to roam across expanses of ice and catch prey. The study, published in Plos One, used sea ice projections from 2006 to 2100 to gain an insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears. Biologist Stephen Hamilton from University of Alberta said: ‘We predict that nearly one-tenth of the world’s polar bear habitat, as much as one-quarter of their global population, may undergo significant habitat loss under business-as-usual climate projections.’ Last week, UN scientists warned that carbon emissions must be cut to zero by at least 2064 if the planet is to avoid the effects of climate change becoming out of control. They said that emissions from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, should hit net zero between 2055 and 2070 to prevent temperatures rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The stark report, by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said that emissions need to peak within a decade, with all greenhouse gas emissions halving by mid-century, in order to avoid sea levels rising and dramatic weather conditions, such as widespread droughts. Countries have already agreed to limit temperature rises to no more than 2°C - beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change are expected - but UNEP said that if the world carries on as it is, greenhouse gas emissions will be ‘way beyond safe limits’. Another study has revealed that the population of endangered African penguins fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and is continuing to decline. There are less than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild in South Africa. Every year, experts from Bristol Zoological Society rescue chicks abandoned by their parents foraging for food, but this year they say the chicks are coming in early ‘in their hundreds’. A study has revealed that the population of endangered African penguins fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and is continuing to decline . The crisis is not a direct result of global warming, but due to falling fish stocks. The rehabilitation centre in South Africa is already helping to care for 430 and the numbers are growing at a previously unseen rate. Because if the soaring price of fish, the Society has launched an appeal to feed and care for the chicks. Dr Christoph Schwitzer, Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society said: ‘Unless conservation organisations intervene, these chicks will starve to death. ‘As African penguin populations are currently facing a crisis due to a diminished food supply near their nesting colonies, there is a substantial risk that this species could eventually become extinct without action.’ Chicks are abandoned at this time of year just before their parents start their moulting cycle, when they develop a new set of waterproof feathers. Adult African penguins still need to make foraging trips during this time and leave their chicks behind. Due to an increasing decline in fish stocks, penguins have to journey further afield for their food but are unable to swim before their moulting cycle. This means that they cannot feed their chicks that are not old enough to fend for themselves, resulting in abandonment and starvation.

"Tragic L'Wren Scott's family have spoken of their fury at Sir Mick Jagger over the Rolling Stones' legal battle to claim $13million from insurers after canceling tour dates in the wake of her death. Miss Scott's closest loved ones are astonished by Jagger's 'unbelievable' decision to reap financial settlement and question his commitment to his girlfriend of 13 years, who hanged herself on March 17. Miss Scott's sister Jan Shane was so upset by the Rolling Stones front man's actions, who the family accuse of 'opening up old wounds,' she couldn't bring herself to comment. But her husband Rob, 58, spoke for the family and told MailOnline exclusively: 'We just can't believe Mick's doing what he's doing. Scroll down for video . L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses . Jan Shane, 53, left, and her husband Rob Shane find it hard to believe that money is so important to Mick Jagger he would  show so little regard for L'Wren . 'Jan is trying to put it all behind her, it's a really troubling part of her life losing her sister, and he's in a legal battle with some insurers.' Speaking at the couple's home near Salt Lake City, Utah, he said: 'The guy [Jagger] doesn't need the money, I laughed when the insurance company turned down his claim. 'All the s*** that Mick is claiming about being unstable, it's ridiculous he's trying to get his way. In a way, I'm not surprised he's doing it. The guy is just unbelievable.' The band postponed the Australian and New Zealand dates of their world tour when Miss Scott died in March of this year, then made a claim for the costs against their insurance policy. But the insurers are refusing to pay out, saying the policy did not cover suicide. A judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from Miss Scott's brother, Randall Bambrough, to find out more about her mental state. However, Mr Bambrough told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons. The documents, filed by the insurers and obtained by MailOnline from the federal court in Salt Lake City, claim Jagger's 'acute traumatic stress illness' was 'due to known, pre-existing physical, psychological and medical conditions of Miss Scott'. It's alleged Miss Scott 'had been suffering from a mental illness' and 'either received, or at least had been recommended, medical attention', therefore her death should not be considered to be 'sudden and unforeseen'. The underwriters make reference to Miss Scott's 'lack of care, diligence and/or prudent behavior in committing suicide by hanging herself', which they believe 'increased the risk and/or likelihood of a loss otherwise recoverable under the policy'. In the 105-page document the eight insurers, led by Cathedral Capital and Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Limited, both based in London, claim these points are suitable reasons for denial in settling the claim from the Rolling Stones. The Stones' insurance policy was covered for $24million, while the tour was expected to make $44million. An autopsy confirmed Miss Scott's death was suicide after she was found in her luxury Manhattan apartment. Family portrait: Childhood photos of L'Wren Scott in Utah. The intimate family photos were shared by L'Wren's sister Jan Shane. Pictured: (back row from left) Randall Bambrough, Ivan Bambrough, Lula Bambrough, (front row from left)  L'Wren Scott and Jan Shane in 1967 . Jagger greets his late partner L'Wren Scott before her catwalk show last year . Jagger developed the acute traumatic stress disorder after losing his long-time partner, according to the papers. Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of guilt and emotional numbness. If the disorder persists for more than one month, it becomes traumatic stress disorder. The singer was subsequently instructed by doctors to take a month off, forcing the Stones to cancel live shows in Australia and New Zealand. However the underwriters have accused the rocker of failing to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist before abandoning the scheduled dates Down Under. Rob, shaking his head in disbelief, told MailOnline: 'I read that he's claiming $12.7 million due to the cancellation of the [Rolling Stones] tour and I can't understand that. L'Wren left her entire estate to him and that was valued around the same amount. 'It seems heartless. How distraught could he have really been, seriously? It was only a month or two after L'Wren's death he was with this ballerina or whatever. I mean how distraught [was Mick]?' Defending his late sister-in-law Miss Scott he says: 'L'Wren wasn't mentally unwell, you know it's just some times life catches up to you.' Rob told how Jan, 54, is 'finding it hard' to discuss her sister right now, adding: 'The whole situation is a big ball of weight being dragged behind her and it's opening up old wounds.' The underwriters claim suicide was not covered in the $13million policy taken out by the Stones if they were forced to cancel their tour. The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after  L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life . Last month, the insurers also  filed a lawsuit in New York's Federal court, and subpoenaed Adam Glassman, the executor of Scott's will; the New York City medical examiner; and Brittany Penebre, her British assistant. The move was an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an 'actual or alleged attempt at self harm by Miss Scott' as well as her general mental health, or an 'actual or alleged suicide attempt'. Miss Scott, a fashion designer and model, was 49 when her body was found in her Manhattan apartment by Miss Penebre. An autopsy confirmed her death was suicide. Her fashion business had been £4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at London Fashion Week, supposedly due to technical difficulties. There were also reports she and Jagger had split up, leaving her 'devastated', although Jagger's spokesman denied this. Documents filed at the district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, reveal Miss Scott was on a long list of family on the Stones' insurance policy. Also on Jagger's list were his ex-wives Jerry Hall and Bianca Jagger, former girlfriends, seven children and four grandchildren. The documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked. The revenue for the tour was expected to be £28million, and this could have gone up if 15 extra European dates were added. The insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy. A spokesman for the Rolling Stones declined to comment. Lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment. * The Samaritans can be contacted by phone in the US 1 (800) 273-TALK and in the UK on 08457 909090 or www.samaritans.org. Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards . The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle. Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered. For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to 'alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis'. More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either. For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with 'alcohol abuse' is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica. The documents show the band expected to receive $46.6million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth $14.3million.","The Stones were forced to postpone Australia and New Zealand leg of tour after L'Wren Scott committed suicide .

"Many of us have become so reliant on our smartphones, we use them to carry out a staggering 221 tasks every day. A study of 2,000 smartphone owners revealed that the average user reaches for their phone at 7:31am each morning, to check personal emails and Facebook. And before they’ve even got out of bed, the majority of people check the weather, read the news, and send a text or two to friends. Scroll down for video . The average user reaches for their phone at 7:31am in the morning, according to new research, and these users typically check personal emails and Facebook before they even get out of bed. Almost four in ten smartphone owners admitted feeling lost without their gadgets . It also emerged that people will check the train times, do their banking and update Instagram early on in the day. The research was carried out by marketing agency Tecmark. In an average week, research has discovered that the average user pick ups their phone more than 1,500 times a week. The average owner uses this device for three hours and sixteen minutes each day - or the equivalent of almost one full day a week. Almost four in ten users admitted feeling lost without their gadgets. Many owners also confessed to finding themselves using their phone without realising they are doing so, with two thirds saying they have managed to log in and browse Facebook without thinking. And surprisingly, four in ten said they have, at one time or another, checked their emails automatically without thinking. The study  also revealed that smartphones are becoming more of a ‘go-to-gadget’, replacing desktops and laptops, which people only turn to for, on average, 140 tasks in a typical day. Managing director Richard Heyes said: ‘Smartphones are an easier way to access information and our friends through the Internet. ‘For most of us, it’s now second nature. 'And certainly we’re not surprised to see this huge reliance on our handheld devices. 'But many people may not realise just how many times a day they check their phone or carry out a simple task on it.’ ‘We’re all guilty of picking up our phones and checking the news or work emails when we first wake up - for many it’s how we set ourselves up for the day. ‘It’s so much easier checking your phone for Facebook updates rather than waiting for a desktop or laptop computer to load - we don’t have that much time in the mornings.’ In an average week, the research discovered that users pick up their phone more than 1,500 times to complete various tasks from emails to playing games and posting to social media. And the average smartphone user is on their phone for three hours and sixteen minutes a day. This amounts to almost one full day a week using their phone, so it’s no wonder almost four in ten users admitted feeling lost without their gadgets.

"Tanya Byron said modern parenting styles, and particularly a reluctance to say 'no' to children, were harming their offspring . Parents are increasingly adopting a ‘spreadsheet’ approach to family life and treating their children as friends instead of asserting their authority, according to a leading psychologist and broadcaster. In a speech to head teachers, Professor Tanya Byron spelled out how modern parenting styles – including an unwillingness to say ‘no’ to children - may be doing more harm than good. Some parents project their own ideas about success onto their children and force them to lead over-scheduled lives filled with activities, she said. This ‘spreadsheet’ approach leads to children being pushed in directions that ‘bear no resemblance to what they feel or want for themselves’. Parents also increasingly struggle to say ‘no’ to their children and try to act as their equal rather than their boss, she added. These ‘friend-parents’ are leaving youngsters ill-equipped for the real world and forcing schools to step in to lay down boundaries. Addressing the Girls’ Schools Association, Professor Byron said: ‘A lot of parents feel completely disabled to parent. They’re terrified. I see the friend-parent phenomenon. I see it when they’re very young.’ But she added: ‘This idea that I have to be my child’s friend is a really dangerous one. You need to say no and give them containment and structure. Say “stop”. ‘I remember when my parents said no. You sucked it up. ‘The problem for a lot of children is that their parents haven’t said no since they were little so by the time they get to be a teenager they’re b***ered. 'I don’t get what the issue is. Why can’t parents say no? What’s the problem?’ Professor Byron, who has been a clinical psychologist for 25 years and featured on the BBC series House of Tiny Tearaways, added: ‘The problem for schools is that not only do you have to educate kids and help them eat a healthy diet, you’ve kind of got to parent them as well. 'It is a systemic approach [that is required] and looking at how parents need to establish boundaries.’ She had also observed how ‘some families have an almost spreadsheet approach to parenting’. ‘We all want the best for our children but there are parents where the best is a huge projection, so that the child reflects something about them as parents,’ she told the GSA, which represents independent girls’ schools. ‘There’s nothing wrong with being ambitious but I meet a number of children who have been pushed and crafted into something that bears no resemblance to what they feel about or want for themselves.’ Professor Byron also said parents were being too friendly with their children, and were unwilling to assert their authority which wsa doing more harm than good . In a further warning, Professor Byron highlighted that growing numbers of teenagers are suffering from eating disorders and self-harm due to the pressure of exams. She said she was astonished at the attitude of some parents who were worried that treating problems might interfere with exam preparation. ‘Parents are often very concerned and shocked at how any treatment may impact on their child’s continued preparation for exams,’ she added. ‘For instance, you may tell them that their child may not be able to do her GCSEs at present.’ Parents’ attitudes can cause ‘incredible damage’ to their child, she said. Professor Byron said that self-harm among boys was also increasing, and that even the children of ‘aspirational middle class parents’ were vulnerable. ‘It is absolutely heart-breaking and it is increasing,’ she added. Professor Byron, who advised the last Government on the impact of video games and the internet on young people, went on to warn that some vulnerable youngsters were at risk from social media since they were using it in ‘really unhelpful’ ways. ‘Children are digital natives, we are digital immigrants,’ she added. The conference heard earlier in the week how social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are creating a generation of timid parents who are afraid to discipline their teenage children for fear of being shamed on social media. According to GSA president Alice Phillips, grumpy teens are increasingly refusing to back down in rows with their parents as friends egg them on via social networking sites. Parents are becoming ‘less bold and intuitive’ when disciplining adolescents amid fears that family disputes will be broadcast to hundreds of friends online, she claimed.","Professor Tannya Byron says modern parents cannot say 'no' to children .

"As all motorists will know, it is sometimes necessary to nudge out into queuing traffic or to merge into other lanes  in order to reach your destination that little bit quicker. Now Google has realised that if it wants its driverless cars to be able to compete with pushy human drivers on the open road, they too need to be more assertive. After testing its autonomous vehicles over 700,000 miles of public road, Google's engineers have tweaked the software that controls the cars to give them a slightly more aggressive edge. Scroll down for video . Software engineers working on Google's driverless cars have to teach the vehicles to drive more like human motorists to help them compete on busy roads where aggressive drivers tend to get ahead . This means that Google's cars will inch forward at junctions, particularly those with four-way intersections, to get through ahead of other drivers. The car will also drive closer to the vehicle in front than is recommended in the Highway Code, in an attempt to avoid other motorists from cutting dangerously in front of them. While this distance is recommended to give humans time to react to hazards and time to stop, experts say autonomous vehicles can react immediately and so drive closer together. 'We found that we actually need to be - not aggressive - but assertive,' Nathaniel Fairfield, technical leader of a team that writes software fixes for the vehicles, told the San Jose Mercury. 'If you're always yielding and conservative, basically everybody will just stomp on you all day.' Google has been testing a fleet of retrofitted driverless vehicles on roads around the US with a team of safety drivers who sit behind the wheel ready to take over should anything go wrong. Earlier this year the company also unveiled a new compact version of its car without a steering wheel. Google tested converted hybrid cars (pictured) over 700,000 miles on public roads in California and has tweaked its software to reduce gaps between vehicles to avoid other drivers from cutting in front of the car . It is planning to build around 100 of these prototype vehicles, and will begin testing them on the roads in the US, but they are not expected to be commercially available until at least 2017. The first driverless vehicles are due to begin appearing on British roads in January next year in three trials to be held in busy city centre environments. However, some experts have raised concerns about the safety implications of putting autonomous vehicles on the road with human drivers. A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars. Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly. Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to  begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. The cars are also expected to be electric, capable of going 100 miles (160 km) before needing to be recharging. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in an attempt to be safer for pedestrians. The prototypes are restricted to speeds of 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. But ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service, using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. The findings will raise fears that drivers may adopt other aggressive driving styles if they see Google's driverless vehicles behaving more assertively. However, Google has also been teaching its vehicles how to drive more safely by giving them instructions on 'defensive driving' styles. Brian Torcellini, driving program manager who has been overseeing testing on the Google self-driving car project, said: 'When our car drives more naturally it makes people in the car and those driving around us feel more comfortable and safe. 'One of the things you will notice a good defensive driver does is avoid other people's blind spots, knowing that it is unsafe to be somewhere where another driver cannot see you. 'Our car didn't always used to do this we thought that it would be a good feature to implement into the software to make our car a good defensive driver.' He added that they have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles 'body language' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are. 'We're now trying to teach the car different ways to sort of fit in with society and the way that other people drive,' he said. Most of the tests on Google's cars have been conducted around its headquarters in Mountain View in California in converted Lexus hybrid cars equipped with radar, video cameras and rooftop laser to sense the world around them. Google claims that none of its vehicles have yet to get a traffic ticket or to be involved in an accident, although there was one accident when a human driver took over control.","Engineers have programmed Google's cars to inch forward at junctions .

"Child killers Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead have been granted a divorce after he agreed to a separation while behind bars for killing their six children. Philpott, 58, who is serving life in prison for the manslaughter of six of his 17 children in Derby, agreed to a divorce after being asked by his 34-year-old wife. The pair were jailed at Nottingham Crown Court after their children - Jade, John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayn – died in a deliberate house fire at their home in May 2012. Scroll down for video . Child killer Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead have been granted a divorce after he agreed to a separation while behind bars for killing their six children. The pair were formally separated after she filed proceedings . Mick Philpott with the children he killed - from top left, John, nine, Duwayne, 13, Jack, seven, Jessie, six, Jayden, five, and Jade, ten - at their council home in Derby in 2012. He is currently serving life in prison . Mairead's sister Bernadette Duffy today said she was glad her relative had parted from Philpott. She told the Daily Mirror's Martin Fricker: 'She's divorced Mick  - she could have done it a lot sooner before they killed the kids. They're both evil, both as bad as each other and good riddance to the pair of them.' The pair are said to have been granted a decree nisi last week after Mairead began divorce proceedings  earlier this year after telling her cellmates she no longer loved him. It came after she reportedly started exchanging romantic letters with Paul Mosley, 47, who was also sentenced to 17 years for his part in the horrific crime. Philpott, a father of 17, is said to have already moved on from his partner of 11 years, and is keen to meet a new lover when he is released from prison. A source told The Sun: 'Incredibly, since he has been inside he has been getting letters from quite a few obviously sick women who have told him they would be keen to meet him when he gets out. Clockwise from top left - Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jessie, six, Jayden, five, and Jack, eight . The six children died in the blaze in May 2012 and dozens lined the streets for their funeral in June 2012 . 'He's been writing back to them and now says as a divorcee he will be able to find himself a more genuine woman than Mairead. 'That's just the kind of depraved nut he is. Mick still thinks he's God's gift to women and he will be able to take his pick when he gets out. He's always lived in a fantasy world.' The Philpotts married in 2003 and shared a cramped three-bedroom council house in Derby with his lover Lisa Willis and their children. Philpott led his wife and accomplice Mosley into a scheme to get a bigger council house by burning down his home and framing  Ms Willis for the crime after she walked out on him. He also hoped to win back custody of his five children who had recently moved out of the home. His intention was to rescue the sleeping children through an upstairs window but the plan went disastrously wrong after too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control. The blaze claimed the lives of Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five. Philpott, who had previously been jailed for stabbing his schoolgirl lover 27 times, wove a web of lies trying to get away with the crime and even plotted to 'get rich quick' off generous donations from the local community meant to pay for the funerals of his children. Floral tributes outside Philpott's council house in Derby following the house fire which killed his six children . The three-bedroom council house was torn down by diggers in September last year in the wake of the blaze . The semi-detached home was left ruined by the deliberate fire which was started by Mick Philpott in May 2012 . In the days that followed the fire, Philpott began his elaborate ruse to appear blameless and even appeared at a press conference appealing for information. During a fortnight of surveillance at the hotel where they were put up by police in May after the fire, the couple were heard whispering about the case, with Philpott recorded telling his wife to ‘stick to your story’. They were charged by police on May 30 in connection with the deaths and Mosley was arrested in the months afterwards, having told a friend the plan had been for him to rescue the children. Police initially charged the trio with murder but downgraded this to manslaughter because while their actions were sickeningly reckless, the defendants had not intended to kill the six. However, he was found guilty of the horrific crime at a trial in April last year and sentenced to life behind bars. The judge described the plot as 'a wicked and dangerous plan' that was 'outside the comprehension of any right-thinking person'. He is currently being held in Wakefield Prison  with a minimum term of 15 years after being branded a 'disturbingly dangerous' man. His wife, who is currently at Bronzefield women's prison near Ashford, Surrey, is likely to be released after serving half of her 17-year term for manslaughter. She hopes to be out of jail by her 40th birthday but lost a second bid to challenge the length of her sentence in November last year. There was applause from the public gallery as Court of Appeal judges sitting at Nottingham Crown Court dismissed the renewed application to challenge her jail term.

"An eco-friendly entrepreneur and former NYU student has gone two years without producing any trash after making a 'conscious decision to live sustainably' during her final year of college. Lauren Singer, who majored in environmental science, began working towards living a 'Zero Waste' lifestyle while still studying at NYU and has been completely 'trash-free' for the past two years. The New Yorker even makes her own toothpaste, deodorant and laundry detergent in an attempt to avoid creating any unnecessary waste - and recently founded her own eco-friendly company, The Simply Co, through which she plans to sell her homemade products. Scroll down for video . 'We are the future of this planet': Lauren Singer made the decision to go trash-free while she was a senior at New York University . 'There were two moments that brought me to a trash-free, waste-free lifestyle,' she writes on her blog, Trash is for tossers. 'The first was my senior year of college when my professor Jeffrey Hollender, of Seventh Generation fame, emphasized the importance living your values and made me think about my own personal environmental impact. 'The second was when a fellow environmental studies major would bring lunch to class every week in a single use plastic bag, a disposable water bottle, and a plastic takeout container. 'I would sit there and think, we are supposed to be the future of this planet and here we are with out trash, messing it up.' But while she was determined to embrace a waste-free lifestyle, the eco-blogger admits that the past two years haven't been without their difficulties - however after persevering for so long, she now feels that she is completely 'set up' with everything she needs to keep pursuing a trash-free lifestyle. 'As more and more time passes, I produce less and less,' she explained to New York Magazine. 'In the beginning, I was producing a lot more recycling. That’s because I don’t buy anything packaged in plastic anymore — I’m sort of set up. 'Compost? That has increased. Since I was buying a lot of packaged food, there wouldn’t be things like kale spines in there. Now, there are kale spines. I have more compost, more parts of whole vegetables.' Eco-entrepreneur: The sustainability blogger recently founded her own waste-free cleaning supplies company, The Simply Co . The NYU graduate makes clear that living a trash-free existence is not always easy, and she urges any budding Zero Waste followers to think carefully about the necessary planning that goes into her day-to-day life. 'I stopped buying packaged products and began bringing my own bags and jars to fill with bulk products at the supermarket,' she explained to Mind Body Green. 'I stopped buying new clothing, and shopped only secondhand. I continued making all of my own personal care and cleaning products. I downsized significantly by selling, donating, or giving away superfluous things in my life, such as all but one of my six identical spatulas, 10 pairs of jeans that I hadn't worn since high school, and a trillion decorative items that had no significance to me at all. 'Most importantly, I started planning potentially wasteful situations; I began saying ""NO"" to things like straws in my cocktails at a bars, to plastic or paper bags at stores, and to receipts.' In order to encourage others to adopt the same trash-free philosophy, Lauren began documenting the ups and downs of her lifestyle on her blog and became quickly inundated with queries from readers eager to follow in her eco-friendly footsteps, but worrying that they didn't have the time or skillset to product their own cleaning products like she does. Making big bucks: Lauren's Kickstarter campaign has already raised more than $35,000 . Enter The Simply Co, Lauren's new waste-free cleaning supply company which she is funding through Kickstarter. 'I was an environmental science major in college, and I not only wanted to learn about sustainability, I wanted to actually live it,' Lauren says in her Kickstarter video. 'I thought a lot about the questions ""Why the f**k are there so many chemicals in everything?"", ""When did this become OK?"" and ""Are they even necessary?"" 'Over the past two years, I've been trying to answer these questions, and in the process making my own, well, everything, from toothpaste to deodorant to laundry detergent.' Thus far, Lauren's Kickstarter campaign has received more than $35,000 in pledges from supporters - smashing her initial $10,000 target. Her first product, a three-ingredient laundry detergent, is set to go on sale some time in the new year.","Former NYU student Lauren Singer majored in environmental science but insisted she wanted to 'live' sustainability, not just learn about it .

"In a  discovery that has shocked everyone involved, experts have found DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space as well as re-entry into the atmosphere. Scientists who attached small double strands of DNA to the outer casing of a rocket said they were 'completely surprised' when more than half the samples remained intact. This was despite temperatures soaring to more than 1,000°C (1,800°F) during the short flight to sub-orbital space and back, and it raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life molecules arriving on Earth from space. Scientists at the University of Zurich have discovered that DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space and re-entry into the atmosphere. The  finding was made by attaching DNA to the outer casing of a rocket, shown launching from the Esrange base in Kiruna, Sweden. It has led to questions about the origin of life on Earth . The research, published online in the journal Plos One, was carried out by scientists from the University of Zurich in Switzerland. The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European base of Esrange in Kiruna, northern Sweden, and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket. But scientists decided, in addition, to test the effects space travel has on DNA when carried at three positions on the rocket's outer casing - and found it survived. Panspermia is the theory that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets, in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos. Panspermia proposes life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surface, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed. Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the Earth early in its history. But some go further and suggest that DNA, the essential molecule of life itself, could reach the Earth in meteoric dust, 100 tonnes of which hit the planet each day - a theory known as panspermia. During the experiment, around 53 per cent of the DNA was recovered from the grooves in screw heads, and more than a third remained fully functional. The 'plasmid' DNA carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance. It was shown to function by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria, and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells. Dr Cora Thiel, one of the scientists from the University of Zurich, said: 'We were completely surprised to find so much intact and functionally active DNA.' Professor Oliver Ullrich, from the same university, added: 'This study provides experimental evidence that the DNA's genetic information is essentially capable of surviving the extreme conditions of space and the re-entry into Earth's dense atmosphere.' The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European  Esrange Space Center (shown on map) and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket - but the surprising DNA discovery is likely to spark considerable attention . The type of DNA carried by the rocket was known as 'plasmid DNA' (stock image shown). This carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance. It was shown to function on its return to Earth by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria, and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells . The research also suggested that scientists conducting space missions to other planets needed to be careful about contamination. Proffesor Ullrich said: 'The results show that it is by no means unlikely that, despite all the safety precautions, space ships could also carry terrestrial DNA to their landing site. 'We need to have this under control in the search for extraterrestrial life.' Back in August, traces of plankton and other microorganisms were found living on the exterior of the International Space Station (ISS) by Russian cosmonauts. They claim the plankton were not carried there at launch - but are thought to have been blown there by air currents on Earth. Incredibly, the tiny organisms were found to be able to survive in the vacuum of space despite the freezing temperatures, lack of oxygen and cosmic radiation. Some said the plankton may simply have been contamination from other areas of the ISS. Nonetheless, the discovery appeared to prove extremely primitive life could survive in the harsh environment of space. And, coupled with this latest research, the finding raises interesting questions about the origin of life on Earth. Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the early Earth. But, some go further and suggest DNA, the essential molecule of life itself, could reach the Earth in meteoric dust from elsewhere in the universe (stock image shown) - a theory known as panspermia .

"STAR QUALITY Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Beckhams, Kate Moss. VITAL STATISTICS Before Mustique became the Caribbean playground of the Princess Margaret set in the 1970s, this island in the Grenadines was given over to sugar production. Cotton House's main buildings were originally a warehouse and sugar mill before being transformed by theatre designer Oliver Messel. Celebrity hangout: The Cotton House in Mustik is a playground for the rich and famous . Cotton House on the island of Mustique, in the Grenadines, boasts 17 sea-view rooms, suites, and cottages . Of the hotel's 17 rooms and suites, the garden cottages are the cheapest (although this is a relative term), while the sea-view rooms, with plunge pools, are the most popular. The two-bedroom residence is the most private - with its own butler and a large private swimming pool. The Veranda restaurant cements its seriousness with sashimi alongside a world-class wine list; Prince William and Kate regularly eat here on their stays. The beach cafe is more family-friendly and Basil's Bar - the least manicured part of Mustique - is where everyone ends up for rum punches and beer. Kate Moss limbered up for her 40th birthday celebrations here. Fans of the luxe property include Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . The restaurant of the Cotton House, which has hosted the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Kate Moss . LOCATION REPORT A short hop from Barbados, on an island that mixes classic Caribbean charm (white-sand beaches, palm trees) with about 100 souped-up villas belonging to celebrities, hedge-fund managers and fashion magnates. Surrounded by perfect grass lawns, the hotel also houses tennis courts, riding school and a dive centre. A fleet of golf carts get guests around the island. Stunning location: The blue waters and pristine sand of the Cotton House Hotel . Luxury break: The stunning property boasts 17 rooms and suites and is located in St Vincent .

Kate's family, the Middletons, stayed here before upgrading to the Aurora villa. Recently given a facelift by hotelier Grace Leo, the Cotton House has stayed true to its Caribbean roots with white furniture, overhead fans and a studied informality. Homeowners and guests turn up for the weekly drinks parties in the barn-like Great Room, with its squashy sofas and a bar with every spirit known to mankind. X Factor judge Cheryl Cole tied the knot on Macaroni Beach (pictured) in July . IN THE NEWS X Factor judge Cheryl Cole took on the slightly more unwieldy moniker of Fernandez-Versini when she married on Macaroni Beach in July.

"The U.S. plans to deploy tanks in eastern Europe to reassure Nato allies fearful of Russian aggression, a top American general has said . About 150 tanks and armoured vehicles will be sent as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve in the Baltic states and Poland, with U.S. troops spending months at a time doing joint exercises. Nearly 50 armored vehicles are already in place and another 100 M1 Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles will be 'pre-positioned' in Germany and possibly elsewhere, Lieutenant General Ben Hodges told AFP. Show of force: U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division 1st Brigade Combat team soldiers deployed in Latvia attend a military parade during Latvia's Independence Day celebrations in Riga last week . 'The troops will come over and train, and they'll go back. The equipment will stay behind,' Lt Gen Hodges said in a phone interview from Estonia. The general said arrangement was 'a lot cheaper' than transporting tanks across the Atlantic and more efficient for the training mission. 'I'm going to look at options that would include distributing this equipment in smaller sets, company-size or battalion-size, perhaps in the Baltics, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, places like that,' he said. The plan was revealed as Nato's top commander in Europe said regular Russian forces were providing the 'backbone' to separatist rebels in east Ukraine. The U.S. has about 29,000 soldiers permanently stationed in Germany, Italy and Belgium but has stepped up temporary deployments of troops for training and exercises designed to send a signal to Russia and NATO partners. Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula and its backing of rebels in east Ukraine has sparked grave concern in a region still carred by decades of Soviet occupation and Communist dictatorship. Reassurance: Soldiers of the U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division attend a military exercise 'Iron Sword 2014', at the Gaiziunu Training Range in Pabrade,  38 miles north of the Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania . Today U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, visiting Kiev as head of U.S. forces in Europe, said Russia's 'militarisation' of Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in March, meant Moscow could influence the entire Black Sea region. He met Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and others in the pro-Western leadership to discuss ways the United States could assist Kiev in the conflict with separatist rebels in the country's east. Asked for an assessment of the situation, Gen Breedlove said Russian troops in the east were 'training, equipping, giving backbone ...helping (separatist) forces in the field.' Russia denies sending troops or equipment to the rebels but accuses Kiev of using indiscriminate force against civilians in the two eastern territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ready to fight: U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division 1st Brigade Combat team soldiers deployed in Latvia attend a military parade during Latvia's Independence Day . Lt Gen Hodges, explaining the decision to send heavy military equipment close to the battle zone, said joint exercises are meant 'to provide assurance to those allies that are closest to the threat'. About 600 U.S. Army troops from the 1st Cavalry Division are to depart in mid-December after a three month stint in the Baltic countries and Poland. They will be replaced by soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment based in Vilseck, Germany, who then will hand over in the spring to members of the 3rd Infantry Division, he said. Gen Hodges, who took over as head of the U.S. Army in Europe three weeks ago, said the troop rotations will continue through 2015 and into 2016, saying: 'This is going to go on.' He said American troops had received an overwhelming welcome in eastern Europe. 'I was in Lithuania yesterday, Estonia today, Poland a few weeks back. All I get is ""thank you, thank you, thank you"" from those host nations for what these soldiers represent,' he said.","About 150 M1 Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles will be deployed .

"The massed ranks of St Winifred's School Choir are getting back together on TV to see if there is still no-one quite like grandma. The angelic young singers from Stockport rose to fame - and the top of the charts - in Christmas 1980 and soon found themselves performing on Top of the Pops. They even knocked former Beatle John Lennon off number one spot with their sickly sweet tune. Scroll down for video . The chart-topping children of St Winifred's primary school in Stockport, Cheshire pictured in 1980, have reunited once again to appear in a nostalgic Christmas singing show . There's No-One Quite Like Grandma spent a week at number one having knocked Happy Christmas (War is Over) off the top spot, before being replaced by another Lennon tune, Imagine, in the wake of his death. At their peak the choir even performed with Abba, met Margaret Thatcher and sold more than one million copies of the song. In 2009 the group reunited to create a reworked version of the song in aid of Age UK and other charities. And now the singers will come together once again, to appear on a nostalgic, Channel 4 programme, Rewind its Christmas. Among the original members are Sally Lindsay, who starred in Coronation Street as barmaid Shelley Unwin, and Jennifer Hennessy, a recurring BBC One and Two actress. The choir reformed in 2009 to create a reworked version of the single in aid of various charities. Some of its original members will come together again for the Channel 4 show . Among the original members are actresses Sally Lindsay (left) and Jennifer Hennessy (right) Eileen Brown (left) is now married with children and lives in north London and Tara Daynes (right) who recalls being more excited about staying in a hotel than appearing on Top of the Pops . Five years ago 14 members of the choir reunited  to record a new version of the song for charity Age Concern. The Christmas themed Channel 4 show will include a performance by glam-rockers Slade and The Darkness and an interview with Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan and the family of Kirsty MacColl about the inspiration behind The Fairytale Of New York. In 2009, some of the choir's original members reunited to produce a reworked version of the song in aid of charity. Eileen Brown, who sang alongside her sister in the 1980 hit, recalled chatting with Benny from Abba as an 11-year-old. 'It seems ridiculous now to think that we did things like that.' Tara Daynes, another original choir member, said she was more excited at the prospect of staying in a hotel than she was about performing on Top of the Pops. 'People forget that we were gigging a choir before 'Grandma' so performing was the norm.'

"A little girl with an extremely rare medical condition that made protein poisonous to eat will enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner for the first time, thanks to a recent liver transplant. Three-year-old Kennedy Stevenson, from Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, is one of only eight people to have been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder called S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency, which rendered her body unable to process protein, resulting in degenerative neurological effects. Two weeks ago, Kennedy received a life-saving transplant from Michael Thompson, a high school classmate of Kennedy's mother, Donya McCoy. Smooth operation: Three-year-old Kennedy Stevenson, pictured with her mother Donya McCoy on Monday, underwent a life-saving liver transplant two weeks ago . Mr Thompson, who shares Kennedy's blood type, donated 25per cent of his liver after Mrs McCoy posted a desperate plea for a donor on Facebook. 'She can now have turkey and stuffing,' Mrs McCoy told ABC News of Kennedy, who will remain at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh throughout the holidays, recovering from the 12-hour operation. 'It's just going to be really special that she can eat a Thanksgiving dinner.' 'She just ate a chicken finger for the first time ever,' the proud mother added, noting that Kennedy also got her first taste of chocolate milk, which she was particularly keen on. Devastating diagnosis: Kennedy was born with a metabolic disorder called S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency, which rendered her body unable to process protein . 'Her eyes got big and she just kept sucking the straw. She didn't want to stop,' she said. Kennedy's previous diet had allowed no meat or dairy and just 20 grams of vegetable or fruit protein a day. Mrs McCoy discovered that Kennedy had the devastating disease when she had a seizure at eight months old, and a local doctor was baffled by the results of her MRI. 'He came out to talk to us and told us the white matter in her brain looked like nothing he’d ever seen before,' Mrs McCoy told the New York Daily News. Extremely rare: Kennedy is one of only eight people to have been diagnosed with the metabolic disorder . New diet: Kennedy, who had not been allowed to eat meat or dairy, will now enjoy her first Thanksgiving meal . While other doctors were similarly stumped, Dr S. Harvey Mudd, an 86-year-old metabolic specialist, came out of retirement to treat Kennedy, and diagnosed her with the disorder. After Dr Mudd died 11 months later, Dr Kevin Strauss, the medical director of the Clinic for Special Children, in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, took Kennedy on as a patient and determined that a liver transplant was the best option. 'So she’s the first in the world to have a liver transplant for her disease,' Mrs McCoy said. Generous donor: Kennedy received a transplant from firefighter Michael Thompson (pictured), a high school classmate of her mother . Selfless: 'It’s just something that I want to do. I was put here on Earth to help people,' Mr Thompson (pictured with Kennedy) said . Mrs McCoy posted the request for a liver donor on Facebook in July, and Mr Thompson, 36, a firefighter from her hometown of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, responded - even though they weren't close friends at the time. 'It’s just something that I want to do,' Mr Thompson, who has a wife and two young children of his own, told LancasterOnline before the surgery. 'I was put here on Earth to help people.' Mr Thompson was only hospitalized for a week, but was advised not to work for several months. Kennedy will need to stay in the hospital for four months, where her father, Nick Stevenson, and stepfather, Josh McCoy, plan to visit her regularly.","Kennedy Stevenson, from Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, is one of only eight people in the world to have been diagnosed with this metabolic disorder .

"Bill Cosby testified under oath in 2005 that he gave the National Enquirer an exclusive interview about looming sexual-assault accusations by a Canadian woman against him in exchange for the tabloid spiking a second accuser's story. Excerpts released Wednesday of Cosby's deposition from a civil lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand quote Cosby as saying he feared the public would believe her sexual-assault accusations if the Enquirer published similar claims by Beth Ferrier. Both women accused Cosby of drugging and molesting them. Scroll down for video . Bill Cosby testified under oath in 2005 that he gave the National Enquirer an exclusive interview about looming sexual-assault accusations by a Canadian woman against him in exchange for the tabloid spiking a second accuser's story . Constand later sued Cosby and the Enquirer, alleging defamation. The claims were consolidated with her sexual-assault lawsuit against Cosby and were settled. 'Did you ever think that if Beth Ferrier's story was printed in the National Enquirer, that that would make the public believe that maybe Andrea was also telling the truth?' Cosby was asked. 'Exactly,' Cosby replied, according to court motions initially filed under seal and made available from archived federal court records. Cosby, in the deposition, said he had a contract with the Enquirer. 'I would give them an exclusive story, my words,' Cosby said in the Sept. 29, 2005, deposition. In return, 'they would not print the story of - print Beth's story.' The release of the documents comes after Cosby this month was shown on an Associated Press video trying to persuade the news cooperative not to use his response when asked this month about sexual-abuse allegations. 'I would appreciate if it was scuttled,' Cosby said in a videotaped exchange with the AP on Nov. 6. Cosby said in 2005 he had been given a draft of Ferrier's interview with the Enquirer and was told she had passed its lie-detector test. He said he also was given an advance look at his exclusive, titled 'My Story,' which warned that he would defend against anyone trying to 'exploit' him. Constand later sued Cosby and the Enquirer, alleging defamation. The claims were consolidated with her sexual-assault lawsuit against Cosby and were settled. Email messages seeking comment Wednesday from the National Enquirer's editor and spokeswoman were not immediately returned. Cosby said in 2005 he had been given a draft of Ferrier's interview with the Enquirer and was told she had passed its lie-detector test . Cosby had said at his deposition that Constand and her mother asked only for an apology in early phone calls about the issue in January 2005, and he said they received one. 'Andrea's mother said, `That's all I wanted, Bill,'' Cosby testified. Constand's lawyers argued in their defamation suit: 'Requesting only an apology is not the action of an extortionist or someone who wants to `exploit' a celebrity.' They said that Cosby later called back and offered to pay for Constand's 'education.' Constand had met Cosby through her job with the women's basketball team at Temple University in Philadelphia, and she said he sexually assaulted her at his nearby home in 2004. She quit the job and moved home that year, and she first filed a report with Ontario police on Jan. 13, 2005, and filed a federal civil suit that March. After prosecutors near Philadelphia decided not to file criminal charges, several other women came forward to support Constand's claims, including Ferrier. Ferrier has gone public about what she called her brief affair with Cosby when she was a model in 1984. She said that he once drugged her coffee during an encounter in Denver and that she woke up hours later in the backseat of her car with her clothes disheveled. A comedian this year referenced the accusations anew in a performance, prompting some of the suit's Jane Doe witnesses to reveal their names and other women to raise new accusations . The Enquirer in 2005 withheld her story and instead published Cosby's account, in which he said, 'Sometimes you try to help people and it backfires on you and then they try to take advantage of you.' In the legal deposition, taken at a Philadelphia hotel, Constand's lawyer asked Cosby if he tried in the Enquirer article 'to make the public believe that Andrea was not telling the truth?' 'Yes,' Cosby replied. Constand's civil lawsuit grew to include nine women willing to testify about allegations of sexual assaults involving Cosby. Some came forward after a suburban Philadelphia prosecutor declined to file criminal charges over Constand's police complaint. A comedian this year referenced the accusations anew in a performance, prompting some of the suit's Jane Doe witnesses to reveal their names and other women to raise new accusations. Cosby has refused to discuss allegations raised in recent weeks by numerous women.","Excerpts of Cosby's deposition from a civil lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand quote Cosby as saying he feared the public would believe her sexual-assault accusations if the Enquirer published similar claims by Beth Ferrier .

"This striking video shows the moment a rare albino deer is captured on camera as it strolls around a park in Minnesota. The deer was spotted by an amateur wildlife photographer in Father Hennepin State Park located on the southeast corner of Mille Lacs Lake. And the stark white animal is such a rare deer that some experts suggest that only one in 20,000 are born. Scroll down for video . Snowy: The white deer emerges from the park as other deer walk ahead of it . The photographer told Jukin Media: 'We occasionally drive through the park after work in hopes of seeing a white deer. 'On Friday, November 14, 2014, as we entered the park, the deer were there and we captured this clip.' It can be difficult to spot a white deer when there is heavy snow, and even more rare to see an albino deer in the wild. Sadly, the beautiful animals rarely live to adulthood because predators can spot them so easily, making them easy prey. They also suffer from very poor eyesight. Rare: The white-haired animal is so rare that some experts suggest that only one in 20,000 are born . Standstill: Two deer stop for a moment in Father Hennepin State Park in Minnesota . They are the incredibly striking animals with a coat of white fur and even a white tail. The White deer's color is passed on as a genetic trait. And the animals are extremely rare. Wisconsin naturalist John Bates, co-author of 'White Deer: Ghosts of the Forest,' said albino deer are born once in about 20,000 births. However, some biologists claim only one in 100,000 deer is born albino, the report said. Any white deer that lacks all color pigments are called 'true albinos.' The animals are typically identified by their pink nose and eyes–the result of blood vessels showing through the skin and clear lens of the eyes. Deer that have normal eyes and nose but a white coat color are referred to as 'white deer.' Seneca County, New York has one of the largest herds of white deer. The White pigmented white-tailed deer live in what is known as the Conservation Area of the former Seneca Army Depot. The army gave the white deer protection while managing the normal-colored deer through hunting. Another population of white deer live near Boulder Junction in north central Wisconsin, with smaller populations in Manitowish Waters and Land O’ Lakes (all in Vilas County). These deer are also protected. Historical records suggest that white deer may have lived in the Boulder Junction area since the earliest years of white settlement.","The albino deer was spotted roaming around Father Hennepin State Park .

"A woman who was just 13 when her parents handed her over to a cult leader who allegedly sexually abused her for a decade has confronted her father in an emotional interview. Lindsay Tornambe, now 27, was selected by Victor Barnard, the leader of the River Road Fellowship in Minnesota, to be one of his 10 'Maidens' and allegedly went on to endure years of sexual abuse at his hands. Barnard, 53, is being sought by authorities for 59 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct but has eluded authorities for months. Police believe former members of his cult may be harboring him. On Monday, Lindsay appeared on Dr Phil and came face-to-face with her father, Carmen, for the first time in more than a year and demanded to know why he had not protected her from Barnard. Scroll down for video . Anger: Lindsay Tornambe, 27, has confronted her father on Dr Phil about why he allowed her to live with an alleged cult leader when she was 13 - even though he knew the man would have sex with her . Denial: Her father, Carmen, said he did not know that the leader, Victor Barnard, was abusing his daughter . She was sent to live with Barnard after he held a special ceremony where he 'spiritually married' the 10 girls by putting veils on their heads, rings on their fingers and by placing salt in their mouths. 'My parents witnessed the salt ceremony,' she told Dr Phil. 'It was clear to me at that moment that my parents weren't going to stop it.' At the ceremony, Barnard told her parents that he 'may or may not' have sex with her, she said, and shortly after she moved in with him, he began abusing her, she said. 'He said that Jesus Christ had Mary Magdalene and other women... and that it would be spiritual and natural for him to take care of me in that way,' she said. But her father, Carmen, insisted on Dr Phil that he did not know about the sexual abuse. 'How could you not know?' she asked, fighting back tears. 'You saw me with a veil over my head with a ring he had given me. He said he may or may not have sex with me. How would you not know?' 'Abuser': Victor Barnard, pictured with Lindsay, is on the run from authorities after she and another woman went to cops with their claims two years ago. There is a warrant out for his arrest . Demands: He selected 10 'Maidens' including Lindsay (pictured) to live with him, look after him and have sex with him, Lindsay said. The girls were between 12 and 14 when they were chosen . She went on: 'You didn't do your job as a father. You abandoned me. You left me there for years. You saw me humiliated and kicked out of meetings in front of the whole church. I don't understand why you keep saying you didn't know what happened.' Her father insisted that the cult leader had indicated that if he ever had sex with Lindsay it would be 'later on in... life' and that 'my biggest mistake was to trust the wrong man'. 'I felt like I was manipulated into his power,' he said. 'My perspective was that she was serving the church, I didn't know all those other things were happening.' But he added: 'There's not a day that goes by that I don't count the cost of realizing that I take my full accountability and responsibility for what had taken place. I did not give a blessing or an OK.' He added that he himself thought about leaving the group many times over the 10 or 11 years he stayed there but he had 'no back up'. Lindsay told Dr Phil she believes some of her relatives are still involved with Barnard, who is still hiding from authorities. A nationwide warrant was issued for his arrest on April 11. Barnard fled from Minnesota in 2009 after he was confronted about sleeping with married women. 'Sick': Lindsay, pictured with Barnard, said she did not even know what sex was when she went to live with him and he became angry that she did not understand - and had sex with her anyway . Hurt: She said that she believes her father, pictured with her when she was younger, knew about the abuse but was just a 'coward'. He claimed that he had been manipulated by Barnard and could not leave . In 2012, after enduring years of abuse, Lindsay alerted authorities to the girls' plight. Another former cult-member, Jess Schweiss, also told authorities her story and the counts of abuse against him stem from their claims. He could face more if other alleged victims come forward. The women say they were just 12 and 13 when, with their parents permission, they went to live with Barnard as part of a group known as the Maidens. On the run: Barnard is now being sought on 59 counts of criminal sexual conduct involving 2 girls . The Maidens, aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Bernard and forced to have sex with him anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade. He said that Jesus and King Solomon had many women followers, so 'God's word' meant that it was normal for him to have sex with them. 'I still had a conscience, I knew it was wrong,' Schweiss, who marked every sexual encounter with Barnard with an 'x' on a calendar, told Fox in an interview earlier this year. Her father told authorities that he 'felt pressured to not say anything' about the sexual activity, according to the criminal complaint. Schweiss has now cut her parents out of her life. 'I don't look at them as my parents anymore,' she said. 'They weren't the parents I wanted or needed. My parents, the people I grew up with as a child, don't exist anymore.' Lindsay said in the Fox interview that she did not even know what sex was before she went to live with Barnard and that he came angry with her when she said she didn't understand. He had sex with her anyway and urged her not to tell anyone, she said. She added that her parents rarely came to visit, even though they lived just five miles away. She left his cabin when she was 15 but after her parents berated her with their disappointment and Bernard spoke to her about damnation, she reluctantly returned. 'I was really scared, and I didn't know what receiving damnation from God would be like,' she said. 'I ended up just staying.' Scene: The River Road Fellowship had land in Minnesota before the claims surfaced and they fled west . But a few years later, she left permanently and went to live with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania. They still placed Bernard's photographs around their home. When she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', the criminal complaint notes. Tornambe eventually became a nanny, but when she heard cousins happily talking about their lives at a New Year's party in 2012, she realized Bernard had robbed her of hers and she called police. Likewise, Schweiss split from the group and moved to Wisconsin in September 2009, but she said she attempted suicide in 2011. When her brother confronted her, she told him about the abuse. 'I feel bad in one sense that I am taking Victor's life away from him by putting him behind bars, but then again, he took my life away from me, which I should have had,' she said. 'So, I feel that - for lack of better words - I think I'm even.' Pine County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Steven Blackwell said that the 59 counts only relate to the claims by the two women and that authorities are hopeful more will come forward. When asked if he believed there were more, he said: 'I don't know how we couldn't think that.'","Lindsay Tornambe was just 13 when Victor Barnard chose her to be one of his 'Maidens' who were expected to take care of him and have sex with him .

"Created: . 19:27 EST, 25 December 2013 . A doctor attacked a female patient in his surgery when she disagreed with his diagnosis. Dr Abiodun Bale, 42, grabbed Sheena Cunningham as she tried to leave his consultation room in tears after they argued over treatment for a facial condition. The doctor, who is of Nigerian origin, denied assault when he appeared in court but was found guilty after a two-day trial. Dr Abiodun Olumuyiwa Bale, 42, denied being a 'thug' at the hearing . He was given a six-month  conditional discharge but will face a disciplinary hearing at work and could lose his job. Bale, who qualified as a doctor at the University of Lagos in 1995, worked as a gynaecologist in his home country before coming to Britain and registering with the General Medical Council in 2006. He was given a licence to practise here in November 2009 and was on a placement, for speciality GP training, at Hyndburn Medical Practice in Accrington, Lancashire, when the assault happened on March 26. Eddie Harrison, prosecuting, said Bale had asked Mrs Cunningham to come in to the practice after a telephone consultation about a problem with her face, during which she had become distressed. When she arrived, the doctor told Mrs Cunningham she might need to call for an ambulance if her condition deteriorated later when the surgery was closed. Mr Harrison told Burnley Magistrates’ Court: ‘She didn’t want to do this and at this point he raised his voice.’ Burnley Magistrates' Court: Dr Bale 'flipped' the court heard . Mrs Cunningham was frightened, got up to leave and said she wanted a second opinion, the court was told. ‘[Bale] became agitated and, as she stepped out, he grabbed her hand to prevent her closing the door,’ Mr Harrison said. ‘He then grabbed her by the forearm with both hands and tried to drag her back into the room. She screamed and shouted at him to get off her arm. This attracted the attention of another doctor and two cleaners. The other doctor told Bale to go back into his office and then escorted Mrs Cunningham out of the surgery.’ The court was told that a week earlier the GP, who lives in  Manchester, ‘flipped’ at another patient, shouting at her: ‘For God’s sake, I have other people to see besides you.’ ‘She got up to leave and he tried to grab her hand. She felt frightened and vulnerable,’ said Mr Harrison. Bale claimed the incident with Mrs Cunningham was a misunderstanding, saying: ‘I’m a  doctor, not a thug.’ But Mr Harrison said: ‘There was no mistake or misunderstanding. She was crying so loudly that two ladies outside heard her crying.’ After the allegations, the GMC placed conditions on how Bale worked, including allowing him to carry out consultations only if another qualified medical practitioner was present. The Pennine Acute Hospitals Trust, which employs Bale, said he would face disciplinary  proceedings. ‘The trust will now consider the consequences for his ongoing employment and training,’ a spokesman said. Dr Bale said: 'I have complied fully with the police investigation, I am disappointed with the outcome and I intend to pursue an appeal. I would like to thank my family and friends for their support during this difficult time'.","Dr Abiodun Bale grabbed patient as she tried to leave .

He denied assault but was found guilty after two-day trial .
An article about Dr Abiodun Bale published on 26 December implied that Dr Bale had assaulted two patients. In fact, while he was charged with two counts of assault, he was acquitted of the second. We are happy to clarify this.
Dr Bale's appeal was upheld in April 2014. He made this statement following the verdict: 'I am happy that my appeal was upheld at the Crown Court. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my family and friends for their support during this difficult time.'"
"A pregnant woman was gunned down just moments away from her Queens apartment building Wednesday, ending both her life and that of her unborn child. Anastasia Massey, 27, was reportedly on the way to her home at the Horace Harding Expressway building in LeFrak City at the time of the shooting, having just taken her three children to school at 8:30 a.m. that morning. That's when an unidentified gunman shot the six-months-pregnant Massey in the arm and chest. Anastasia Massey, 27, was reportedly on the way to her home at the Horace Harding Expressway building in LeFrak City at the time of the shooting, having just taken her three children to school . The Daily News reports that a neighbor's daughter started to scream as the shots echoed through the neighborhood. 'It was like a big loud boom,' an anonymous witness said.

"Natalie DuBose was pictured weeping outside her bakery on Monday after vandals broke her windows during the Ferguson protests . A mother-of-two whose cake shop in Ferguson, Missouri, was vandalized and looted during Monday night's protests has received almost $200,000 in donations to help rebuild her business. Natalie DuBose, 32, opened Natalie's Cake's & More at 100 S. Florissant Road in June after finally raising enough money to open her own store. During the violent protests that followed a Grand Jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson her small shop had its front windows smashed in and equipment damaged. 'Hurt is the only word I could really describe,' she told NBC News. 'I was like, 'Wow, you guys really just didn't care, you didn't care, and this affects whether I can feed my children or not, and you just bust through the window with a chair.'' A friend suggested she start a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to clean up and repair her bakery. The response has been beyond Natalie's wildest dreams and she has raised more than $190,000 in just 24 hours. 'I am so grateful and appreciate it. I just can't express it,' she said.

"The cricketer who bowled the bouncer that critically injured batsman Phil Hughes has been seen for the first time since the accident as concerns grow for his well-being. Sean Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground a day after he cradled the injured batsman when he collapsed to the ground. Abbott, who wore a pair of sunglasses, continues to be surrounded by counsellors and teammates over concerns for his state of mind. All players involved in the match are also receiving counselling and psychological support. Scroll down for video . Distraught: Bowler Sean Abbott was seen walking into Sydney Cricket Ground a day after he delivered the bouncer that critically injured batsman Phil Hughes . The young cricketer was seen on Wednesday wearing a pair of sunglasses and was flanked by teammates . Abbott cradles Hughes, who is currently in the Intensive Care Unit at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner suburbs. He is in an induced coma and in a critical condition . The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott closely. It was reported Abbott was struggling mentally as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support. '[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his teammates and also the counselling services,' ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson said. 'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.' Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him. 'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.' The moment Phil Hughes  is struck in the head by a delivery during day one of the Sheffield Shield match between New South Wales and South Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground . This sequence shows Hughes in a daze after being struck by the ball before collapsing to the ground . Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and said the incident was not his fault. 'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said. 'I hope he's got support... You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.' Abbott and Hughes came up through the junior ranks of the NSW cricketing system and are close friends. The 22-year-old made his first-class debut for New South Wales in 2011, and has since played 15 Sheffield Shield matches for his state, taking 38 wickets at an average of 33.94. New South Wales' Sean Abbott (right) bowled the bouncer that hit Phil Hughes on Tuesday . The sporting community, including Marcus North and Brett Lee, have come out in support of Abbott . Cricket legend Glenn McGrath wrote 'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott' after he paid tribute to Hughes . He broke into the Australian side in the shorter form of the game after being the leading wicket-taker during the 2013-14 domestic One-Day Cup. He made his national debut during Australia's ODI and Twenty20 series with Pakistan in the UAE in October. Former Test bowler Brett Lee said Abbott did not deserve any of the blame for the incident. 'You know you're always on edge bowling fast or being out there batting,' Lee told Channel 9. 'When you see something as shocking as this you really feel for Phil. 'I know first-hand that no one goes out there to try and maim a batsman, no one tries to hurt a batsman.' Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen. Phil Hughes remains in an induced coma at St Vincent's Hospital in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst . Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott. 'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes. Another former Australian Test cricketer Marcus North called on Abbott to keep his chin up. 'Thoughts also go out to a great young kid @seanabbott77 Stay strong mate! #CricketFamily,' he said. Abbott made his state debut at the age of 18 and won the Steve Waugh Medal as New South Wales player of the season in 2013/14. Last month he made his One Day International and Twenty20 debuts both against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.","Sean Abbott was one of the first players to help the injured batsman .

"There's a letter from Joe DiMaggio begging her to come back to him following their separation; an intense love note from Arthur Miller, a message from Cary Grant, and even an old prescription pill bottle from a pharmacy in Bedford. Over 200 rare personal items of Marilyn Monroe's that have never been seen by the public will go up for auction in Los Angeles next month. The collection of belongings - which also includes her supposedly-favorite black coat, circa mid-1950s, photographs and other memorabilia - were until now kept by her mentor and coach Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982. Each item will go under the hammer separately at Julien's Auctions Beverly Hills gallery on December 5 and 6. Scroll down for video . Private collection: Over 200 personal belongings of Marilyn Monroe will go up for auction in Los Angeles on December 5 and 6 . Intimate: The collection gives a rare insight into the life of the late screen goddess . Personal: Among the items is a prescription bill bottle from a pharmacy in Bedford, New York . For Miss Monroe: Numerous phone messages that were taken at the Beverly Hills Hotel . Insightful: This letter was written to Monroe by Joe DiMaggio after she announced she wanted a divorce. In the letter the baseball star begs for his wife not to leave him . Bling: The belongings, such as this necklace, were left to mentor and coach Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982 . 'We are all in awe of this opportunity to offer such a rare collection and glimpse into Marilyn Monroe’s life,' said Martin Nolan, Executive Director of Julien’s Auctions. 'You can’t help but get emotional on several levels when you have the chance to read the letters and view some of the photographs and witness Marilyn’s own attempt at correspondence.' The collection is a strange glimpse into the late screen goddess' private world. Arguably the most insightful item is a letter from Joe DiMaggio, written after the baseball star learned his wife wanted a divorce. Monroe made the announcement during a press conference in 1954, nine months after their wedding. 'He writes this amazing letter, beautiful handwriting, very impressive,' Nolan told CCTV. 'But his first and foremost number one concern was he truly loved Marilyn, but he was concerned for her welfare, he felt she looked as though she was about to collapse. 'He didn't like to see her crying. And then he expressed his love, he expresses his regret and apologies if he had anyway hurt her. 'And he is begging her to come back to him. So it's a true love letter.' The most expensive item at the auction is said to be Monroe's favorite - a coat she wore consistently in the mid-1950s. The piece originally sold as part of her estate in 1999, but is expected to fetch at least $120,000. Favorite: This coat is said to have been Monroe's go-to and she wore it consistently .

"A seven-year-old girl battling cancer has arrived in America for proton beam therapy, after strangers helped raise more than £180,000 so her parents didn't have to sell their family home. Frankie-Rose Lea, left the UK on Tuesday with her parents Michelle and Sam Lea,  and brothers Alfie, 11, and Freddie, five. Proton beam therapy, which the family hope  will save Frankie’s life after her tumour tripled in size, will start at a clinic in Oklahoma City this week. The family faced a setback before they got on the plane as there were fears that Frankie-Rose, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in August, would not be fit to fly. Frankie-Rose Lea, seven, has arrived in America to receive proton beam therapy treatment for her cancer. Well-wishers donated £180,00 for her treatment. Here, Frankie is pictured thanking readers for their donations . Frankie-Rose's parents Michelle and Sam updated her Facebook followers, revealing the family were off to America on Monday afternoon. She said a 'heartfelt thanks' to all their supporters . Initially, Michelle and Sam Lea, pictured with their sons Alfie (right) and Freddie (left) had vowed sell their family home in a bid to raise £160,000 to fund treatment for Frankie-Rose (centre). But their story received widespread publicity, spurring donations from  well-wishers . A scan revealed a dangerous build of fluid on her brain which indicated she might have needed surgery. The news came shortly after her family and friends raised funds for the treatment, which is not currently available in the UK. Frankie-Rose was admitted to hospital last Wednesday where it was originally feared a shunt on her brain to drain a build-up of fluid  had stopped working and she would need to undergo emergency brain surgery. But her parents were relieved when doctors found the shunt was working, and successfully cleared the build up without the need for surgery. They were then given the green light to fly to America for the treatment they hope will save Frankie’s life. The family initially put their home on the market for £50,000 less than it's market value to try and raise the money for Frankie-Rose's treatment quickly. But her plight gained a huge amount of publicity and donations from well wishers meant the family have raised £185,371 to date. Doctors said the proton beam therapy treatment offers Frankie-Rose the best chance of survival. Without it, she may not live past Christmas, they said . Doctors misdiagnosed Frankie-Rose's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer. She is pictured left and right during treatment . This means they will no longer have to sell their family home in Kent. The family will now stay together in accommodation near the hospital in Oklahoma City where Frankie-Rose will be treated for one hour a day between Monday and Friday for two months. It means they will be able to spend Christmas together in America. Before she left for America, mother Michelle, 36, a dinner lady, revealed the family had been told that the NHS would not have funded Frankie-Rose to have proton beam therapy because her tumour is too aggressive. Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. The radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy. Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body. It enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely. The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues. The treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours, including those found in the head and neck, eye, central nervous system, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal tract. The precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs, such as the eye, brain and spinal cord. Source: Mayo Clinic . She said: ‘Even if we had have applied for funding we wouldn’t have got it so thank goodness we started fundraising.’ She also spoke of her joy at not having to sell the family home and the importance of being able to stay together as a family. She said: ‘Friends, family, everyone that donated, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts. ‘It’s so important for us to be able to stay together at a time like this. As parents you want to be there for all your children and that is what keeps you strong. ‘I’m in awe of the way people have rallied together to help us, our friends and family have been incredible and the kindness of complete strangers has restored my faith in everything.’ But she added that she hoped her daughter’s case would highlight the need for proton beam therapy to be available in the UK sooner rather than later. She said: ‘We are the lucky ones because we have amazing friends and family who have helped us and the public support has been overwhelming, but we still feel that Frankie-Rose and every other patient should be able to access this therapy in the UK. ‘When you are dealing with the news that your child or someone you love has cancer you want to be supporting them and spending time together not desperately fundraising and searching for treatment to try and save them. ‘We need it here now, not in five years time and I hope what happened to us helps make that possible for another family so they don’t have to go through this.’ They now plan to keep their 9,000 followers on Facebook updated with Frankie-Rose’s progress and on Monday evening posted a status with the news that they were set to travel to the states. It said: 'Dear friends, family, donators and well wishers…Everyone who has helped us achieve the following. 'We are off to America at 6am tomorrow morning. Our heartfelt thanks to you all for your help it means we will be together at Christmas getting the best medicine we can. See you next year…Feeling positive.’ Mr and Mrs Lea had planned to cancel their August wedding, after Frankie-Rose, was diagnosed the same month. But the seven-year-old told her parents she was desperate to be a bridesmaid . The comment was met with a surge of over 2,000 likes from supporters. A family friend told MailOnline Frankie-Rose and her parents were in good spirits when they left their south London home yesterday morning. She said: ‘They were feeling really happy and positive to be on their way at last. It’s been a rollercoaster but they got there and Frankie-Rose was smiling. ‘I cannot express how much they appreciate the support they have had from the public across Britain and even worldwide as well as all their family and friends in London. 'Everyone has worked so hard to make this possible and it means so much to them. ‘They they were just so pleased and relieved to be on their way to getting their daughter the best medicine.’ Though the target has been met to cover the initial cost of treatment the fund raising page remains open to help meet the ongoing cost of after care and future treatment Frankie-Rose might need.

"For millions a strong coffee is the perfect start to the day. But today, new research suggests coffee could also protect against  dementia. Drinking between three and five cups  a day could cut the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by up to 20 per cent, scientists said. Nutrition can play an important role in preserving memory and thinking skills, especially during the phase of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms of dementia occur. This is according to a report published by the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee, who are funded by major European coffee companies such as illycaffe, Nestlé and DE Master Blenders. However, experts from leading charities  Alzheimer's Research UK and Alzheimer's society today warned the research does not conclusively prove drinking coffee can prevent Alzheimer's, because no clinical trials have been carried out. Scroll down for videos . Experts found that those who drink between three and five cups of coffee a day could cut the chance of getting Alzheimer's disease by up to a fifth thanks to the ingredients the beverage contains (file picture) The number of cases of dementia is set to triple by 2050, totalling 115.4 million worldwide, and Alzheimer's disease will make up the majority of these cases, according to World Health Organisation predictions. The new report presents new research explaining how diet can affect the development of the disease. A Mediterranean diet, consisting of fish, fresh fruit and vegetables, olive oil and red wine, has been associated with a reduced risk for development of Alzheimer's disease, it argued. Research suggests that compounds called polyphenols are responsible for this protective effect; compounds also found in high quantities in coffee. Other studies cited in the report found regular, life-long moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Dr Iva Holmerova, vice chairman of Alzheimer Europe, said: 'The findings presented in this report are very encouraging. 'Coffee is a very popular beverage enjoyed by millions of people around the world and I'm pleased to know that moderate, lifelong consumption can have a beneficial effect on the development of Alzheimer's disease. 'Cognitive decline is a feature of ageing, and although some changes can be expected in all of us, there is some evidence that diet and lifestyle may be related to cognition.' A recent study, suggested that moderate coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of developing dementia over a four year follow-up period, however the effect diminished over longer follow up period. Caffeine helps prevent the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrulary tangles in the brain - two hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease, it said. In addition to this, both caffeine and polyphenols reduce inflammation and decrease the deterioration of brain cells - especially in the hippocampus and cortex, areas of the brain involved in memory. The report, released by the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee, suggested that moderate coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of developing dementia over a four year period (file picture) Dr Arfram Ikram, from the Erasmus Medical Centre Rotterdam, presented his findings at the symposium. He said: 'The majority of human epidemiological studies suggest that regular coffee consumption over a lifetime is associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, with an optimum protective effect occurring with three to five cups of coffee per day.' But Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer's Research UK, the UK's leading dementia research charity, said clinical trials are needed to prove a link between drinking coffee and a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. He said: 'Although some studies have suggested a possible link between coffee consumption and lower dementia risk, there is currently not enough evidence to be able to draw firm conclusions about its effects. 'Many studies that have investigated these links have been observational studies, which are not able to tell us definitively whether coffee can prevent or reduce the risk of Alzheimer's. 'While many of us enjoy a cup of coffee now and again, we'd need to see clinical trials to know whether the drink could prevent Alzheimer's disease. 'With half a million people currently living with Alzheimer's in the UK and that number set to increase, we must invest in research to find ways of preventing the disease. 'In the meantime, current evidence suggests that we can lower our risk by eating a healthy, balanced diet, doing regular exercise, not smoking, and keeping blood pressure and weight in check.' Jess Smith, of Alzheimer's Society, echoed comments that the evidence is not conclusive. She said: 'The evidence is not conclusive that drinking coffee will help to protect against Alzheimer's disease. 'Some research suggests that caffeine and antioxidants in coffee may be beneficial but studies in people show mixed results - more research and clinical trials are needed to see if positive effects occur in people over the long term. 'There is no single way to reduce your risk of dementia. 'Exercising frequently, as well as eating a healthy balanced diet, avoiding smoking, not drinking in excess, and managing other health conditions can play a role in reducing your risk of dementia.' Meanwhile Professor John Hardy, Professor of Neuroscience, UCL, added: 'This type of study needs both replication and assessment for the possibility/probability of confounding variables to do with other aspects of lifestyle.' The report also highlighted the role nutrition can play in preserving cognitive function, especially during the pre-clinical phase of Alzheimer's, before symptoms of dementia occur. It found that a Mediterranean diet, consisting of fish, fresh fruit and vegetables, olive oil and red wine, has been associated with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's. The research and key findings were originally presented at the Alzheimer's Europe Annual Congress in Glasgow last month before being officially released today. Alzheimer's affects one person in 20 over the age of 65, amounting to 26 million people worldwide. In Britain alone, 850,000 people are affected by dementia, with 60 per cent of those suffering from Alzheimer's.

"Liver disease treatment and detection facilities must be 'scaled up' to deal with the increase in those dying, experts claim . Excessive drinking among the middle classes is fuelling an increase in deaths from liver disease, experts warned yesterday. They claim alcohol dependence has become a ‘lifestyle choice like Armani jeans’ rather than being recognised as a potentially deadly disease. Figures show deaths among younger people have gone up 500 per cent in 30 years, while other European countries are seeing their rates tumble. And current tests for liver damage may be ‘falsely reassuring’ because they cannot show the true extent of scarring caused by alcohol, obesity or viral hepatitis. The Lancet Commission said liver disease treatment and detection facilities must be ‘scaled up’ to deal with the problem. They are calling for GPs to have access to simple scanners which would help detect those at risk from a ‘silent killer’. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, a member of the commission and former president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: ‘Four out of five case of liver disease are caused by alcohol, while death rates from cirrhosis are tumbling in countries like France.’ He said excess drinking was polarised in the UK, ranging from binge drinkers in their 20s to those in late middle age, and blamed the problem on the low price of alcohol. ‘Alcohol dependence is being treated like a lifestyle choice like Armani jeans rather than as a disease. We sell it for pocket money prices,’ he said. ‘People say we have always been big drinkers. In fact it mirrors price almost exactly. ‘If you go back 20 years most drinking was done in pubs and bars. Eighty per cent of all drinking now is done at home – especially old people behind closed doors.’ Apart from Finland, the UK is the only country in western Europe where the prevalence of liver disease has increased. Death rates for those under 65 have increased from 2.82 per 100,000 in 1970 to 10.85 in 2010 – claiming 11,000 lives a year in England and Wales alone. In Finland the death rate is 18.8 per 100,000. The death rate in France is 9.6 – a dramatic fall of two-thirds in recent years. Experts believe 80 per cent of all drinking in the UK is done at home - especially by the elderly behind closed doors. Stock image used . A pill that cuts brain damage caused by binge drinking is being developed by scientists. In tests on rats, the drug reduced the number of brain cells killed by alcohol. Cells saved included those vital to navigation and orientation. The drug, known only as ethane-beta-sultam, also seemed to stop the rats from behaving impulsively. Mike Page, of the University of Huddersfield, said the drug would be a treatment, not a pill youngsters could take before a night out. At present, problem drinkers are given a liver function blood test but the results can be ‘falsely reassuring’ because 80 per cent of people with cirrhosis have normal results, Professor Gilmore said. Instead of relying on outdated testing, GPs should buy or share cheap £30 portable scanners or £70 fixed machines that reveal liver scarring. Dr Nick Sheron, who runs the liver unit at Southampton General Hospital and is co-founder of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said most drinkers will quit when confronted by hard evidence of liver damage. ‘Three-quarters of liver disease is not being picked up,’ he said. ‘[GPs] are using outdated technology and tests that don’t work – they think they work but they don’t. ‘If you give feedback that their liver is scarring 65 per cent will stop, compared to 30 per cent if you just give advice.’ The report also calls for minimum pricing of at least 50 pence per unit. Professor Julia Verne, who speaks on liver disease for Public Health England, said: ‘This is a silent killer. ‘A large glass of wine is like three shots of vodka. It is very easy for people to pour a glass and have no idea how much they are drinking.’","The middle classes are fuelling an increase in deaths from liver disease .

During an awkward interview with A Current Affair, the 71-year-old avoided directly answering the question, 'are you bankrupt,' giving a vague undecipherable answer instead. 'Under chapter seven … by asking that question … a show in Australia, people conjure up what it means in Australia... it's totally different,' Mr Edelsten Channel Nine, before adding, 'everything is under control.'

'I am solvent and in the petitions we will produce to the courts I think it showed assets of $38 million and liabilities of $28 million of which $10 million are disputed. 'So there's probably about $18 million, so it's comfortable.'

The ATO plans to reverse a settlement Mr Edelsten made with the Mawardi family after $30 million was mysteriously removed from his private trust account's financial records . Despite the Australian Federal court restricting his assets last month and the millions of dollars that Mr Edelsten owes the National Australia bank, he remains positive that his debts will not reach above $12 million. 'If I am successful with the case against Mawardi, it's going to be around about 12 million,' he told A Current Affair, adding that if he was not successful, his debts would be around $20 million. 'But I will be successful because justice will be on my side,' Mr Edelsten said. Mr Edelsten, who earlier this year declared bankruptcy in the US, owes money to over 30 international creditors, according to the ABC.

"A drunken passenger was forced to clean up his own mess after he urinated in front of other travellers on an internal flight in South Africa. The Mango Airlines plane was flying from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg on Sunday when the man pulled down his trousers and relieved himself in the aircraft’s galley. But the cabin crew didn’t let him off easy – in addition to being ordered to clean up after himself he was detained by police when the flight landed at OR Tambo International Airport. A passenger urinated in full view of other travellers on a Mango flight in South Africa . Mango Airlines spokesman Hein Kaiser told The Herald that the man wanted to use the toilet during take-off, but was told he had to remain in his seat until it was safe to move about the cabin. That’s when he went to the galley and relieved himself next to the seated cabin crew in full view of other passengers, she claimed. He was forced to return to his seat after resisting and searing at flight attendants and the captain of the flight. Passenger Samantha Meyer told The Herald that the man’s indecent behaviour and the delay it caused were distressing. The unruly passenger was detained and forced to clean up his mess when the plane landed . She said: ‘We had already been forced to wait at the [Port Elizabeth] airport for two hours due to the bad weather which had delayed flights, but when we landed in Johannesburg, we were all told to stay seated while the man and his belongings were removed from the aircraft.' Ms Meyer added that her boyfriend had also needed to use the toilet, but waited patiently until the right time. Ms Kaiser said the airline doesn’t tolerate such behaviour, adding: ‘Moving around the cabin during turbulence presents opportunity for personal injury as well as endangering fellow guests and flight crew on board. ‘When the commander of a flight advises travellers to fasten their seatbelts, it is for good reason and is standard operating procedure on airlines the world over.’","Indecent act occurred on flight from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg .

"For four decades, he has negotiated obstacles placed in his way by foes and erstwhile friends alike. But tonight, an emotional Ken Livingstone announced his retirement from frontline politics after he was defeated by Boris Johnson in the election for Mayor of London. He said it would be his 'last election' and that he was 'sincerely sorry' he had failed to win for Londoners in 'the defeat I most regret'. Mr Livingstone, 66, said: 'This is my last election. Forty one years ago, almost to the day, I won my first election promising to build good council housing and introduce a free bus pass for pensioners. 'Now I have lived long enough to get one myself. I did not think I necessary would at the time. Since then, I have won 11 more elections and lost three. The candidates listen after the announcement of Boris Johnson's victory in the London mayoral elections at City Hall tonight. Ken Livingstone wells up with emotion at the news of his defeat . As Boris Johnson was returned as London Major tonight, a watery eyed Ken Livingstone announced he would not stand again . Ken stood in the background as Boris took centre stage in City Hall tonight . 'But the one that I most regret . losing is this. This is the defeat I most regret, because these are the . worst times for 80 years and Londoners needed a mayor to help them get . through this very difficult period.' In a closely fought race, Mr Johnson garnered 1,054,811 votes (51.53 per cent) to Mr Livingstone's 992,273 (48.47 per cent). But there is no denying that 'Red' Ken has had a good innings. Way back in 1971, when he first stood for Lambeth Council, he proved the master of the dark arts of political manipulation, propaganda and campaigning. Labour MP Michael Foot with Ken Livingstone - when he was leader of the Greater London Council - in Tottenham in 1983 . 'Red' Ken became a bete noire of the Right, supporting everyone from striking miners to Sinn Fein's leaders at the height of the IRA's bombing campaign. Pictured with Sinn Fein MP Gerry Adams in 1989 . Boris Johnson was re-elected as Mayor of London in a surprisingly narrow victory that saw him beat rival Ken Livingstone. The . Conservative polled 1,054,811 to the Labour's candidate's 992,273 . following a deeply personal and bitter campaign battle that saw the two . men clash furiously in public and in private. Mr . Johnson vowed to continue 'fighting for a good deal for Londoners' from . government as he thanked voters for giving him a 'new chance'. The . Mayor outperformed his party, which suffered a significant drubbing . nationally, but failed to secure the massive win predicted by polls over . recent days that had put him as far as 12 points ahead. Early . results in the contest also suggested the incumbent was significantly . in the lead and even senior Labour figures conceded the Tory was poised . to win. But . later count declarations saw the gap reduce, fuelling speculation Mr . Johnson's victory was not the done deal that had been tipped. No candidate won enough votes in the first round to secure victory, meaning second preferences had to be counted. Labour . secured eight of the London Assembly's 14 first-past-the-post . constituencies, gaining two from the Tories, which left them with six. In his most controversial years during the Eighties and Nineties, first as leader of the ultra-radical Greater London Council and then as a hard-left MP for Brent, he was untouchable at the ballot box. Even when Tony Blair kicked him out . of the Labour Party in a desperate bid to stop him becoming London mayor . in 2000, Mr Livingstone still emerged triumphant having run as an . independent. Exactly four years ago, his political . obituary was penned by many pundits after Mr Johnson dramatically . brought to an end his eight-year reign at City . Hall. Reports of his demise . proved as exaggerated as Mark Twain's: within two years, he had not . only secured the Labour candidacy for a fourth tilt but appeared . well-set to return in triumph. But . a seasoned campaigner famous for defying the odds has proved unable to . win even when they were stacked in his favour - neither his personal nor . political magic working on Londoners. And now that door has firmly closed. It . is impossible to imagine Labour - the party which once begged him to . return to the fold - will ever again invest in Mr Livingstone as the . answer to its prayers in the capital. As . his campaign unravelled - in the main thanks to controversy over his . personal taxes - high-profile Labour figures lined up to express regrets . at his return and tell voters not to back him. Such was the poisoned atmosphere that . Labour election chief Tom Watson went so far as to say that voters . should 'hold their noses' and vote for his own party's candidate. That was a sentiment echoed by an eve-of-poll editorial in The Guardian. In his heyday he was the left-wing thorn in the side of the Tories - Margaret Thatcher resorted to legislation to remove him in 1986 - as well as Tony Blair's Government which was so determined to exclude him that it stitched up the selection process, to disastrous effect.

Ken on a march in April1, 1973 protesting against GLC proposals to enclose the Crystal Palace lakes and charge admission . Within two years of joining the Labour Party in 1969, Mr Livingstone was elected as a councillor in his native Lambeth in south London before joining the Greater London Council in 1974. Soon notorious as 'Red' Ken, he became a bete noire of the Right, supporting everyone from striking miners to Sinn Fein's leaders at the height of the IRA's bombing campaign. He famously goaded Mrs Thatcher across the Thames in Parliament during the turbulent 1980s by hanging a banner from County Hall with the unemployment figure on it. After she secured revenge by abolishing the GLC, he joined the ranks of Labour's left wing MPs, harrying the Tories but also clashing frequently with the New Labour modernisers. The Queen and Prince Philip, with Mr Livingstone at the official opening of the Thames flood barrier in 1984 . When Mr Blair restored devolved government to the capital - and created the powerful post of mayor - he certainly did not anticipate that it would open the door for his foe's return. But his every attempt to prevent his worst-case scenario backfired - and such was Mr Livingstone's popularity that he was forced to ensure he was the official candidate in 2004. During that second term, Mr Livingstone won widespread praise for the way he stood up for London after the July 2005 suicide bombings and helped win the 2012 Olympic Games for the capital. There were a string of popular policies too - though tempered by the sorts of personal and professional controversies that have followed him throughout his career. Comedian Eddie Izzard joins Ken Livingstone to protest against rail fare increases last year . In 2005, he narrowly avoided serious punishment when he likened a Jewish reporter to a Nazi concentration camp guard - a theme that also dogged this most recent campaign. A close aide was forced to quit over claims he misused public funds and Mr Livingstone's unusual private life, involving five children by three partners, was the subject of intense scrutiny. Despite that - and the dismal opinion poll ratings of Gordon Brown's unpopular Labour government - he may have clung on but for an equally maverick and colourful opponent in Boris Johnson. With the roles almost exactly reversed four years on, for some time it looked possible that Mr Livingstone could cut short the Tory's tenure. But his momentum was dramatically arrested by a row over claims he set up his business affairs to avoid paying large sums in income tax - and his refusal to publish accounts in full. A bitter personal battle between the two main rivals ensued - one which today's results demonstrate was won by the incumbent. As he contemplates defeat, Mr Livingstone will be a spectator rather than a key participant for the London Olympics he helped secure. And he looks destined to be a spectator too when the contenders next line up for the race for the mayoralty. Just don't expect him to be a quiet one.","Veteran campaigner Livingstone: 'This is my last election'

"This is the tender moment when Pope Francis kissed a bandaged, poorly child in St Peter's Square at the Vatican during his weekly audience. It was a poignant gesture that those watching found very emotional. Every Wednesday, Pope Francis has made a habit of touring for approximately 30 minutes among the thousands of pilgrims who  attend the weekly audience, blessing and shaking hands with various groups of people, and often receiving gifts.

Several other children were also blessed by the Pope as he made his way around the Square including a little girl dressed in pink hat and a baby in a blue coat whose cheek he rubbed. The pictures emerged following the Pope's declaration that dialogue with Isis should always be on the table. He said yesterday that while it was 'almost impossible' to have a dialogue with Islamic State insurgents, the door should not be shut. 'I never say 'all is lost', never. Maybe there can't be a dialogue but you can never shut a door,' he told reporters on his plane returning from Strasbourg, France, where he addressed the European Parliament and the Council of Europe. 'It is difficult, one could say almost impossible, but the door is always open,' he said in response to a question about whether it would be possible to communicate with the militants. Ultra-radical Islamic State has captured thousands of square miles (km) of territory in Iraq and Syria, beheaded or crucified prisoners, massacred non-Sunni Muslim civilians in its path and displaced tens of thousands of people. The Iraqi government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back Islamic State, although Shi'ite Muslim militias and Kurdish peshmerga have helped contain the Sunni insurgents and repelled them in some provinces.

"A foster dad pleaded guilty Wednesday to involuntary manslaughter for leaving a 10-month-old girl inside a sweltering car outside of his house in July while he and his partner smoked marijuana. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett has said Seth Jackson, 29, went to a drug dealer's house July 24 before picking up the girl from a baby sitter. After arriving home, he went inside with a 5-year-old child, but left the baby in the vehicle. It was around 90 degrees outside, and police say the girl was inside the car with the windows up for more than two hours. An autopsy showed she died of hyperthermia due to heat exposure. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Seth Jackson pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter for leaving his 10-month-old foster daughter inside a sweltering car outside of his house in July while he and his partner smoked marijuana . Killed: It was around 90 degrees outside, and police say the girl, Kadillak Poe Jones, was inside the car with the windows up for more than two hours . Sedgwick County District Attorney's Office spokesman Dan Dillon said authorities are identifying the child only by her initials, which are K.P.J. Local media, however, and MailOnline earlier reported the girl's name is Kadillak Poe Jones. The affidavit said that Jackson realized that Jones was in the car when he heard a baby crying on an episode of 'Game of Thrones' they were watching. The couple allegedly viewed one-and-a-half episodes of the program, the affidavit said. The men rushed outside, Jackson unlocked the vehicle and his partner, Payton Schroeder, removed the child. Schroeder told investigators Jones was hot and stiff when he carried her into the house. As he called 911, Jackson attempted CPR but could not get the child's mouth open, according to the affidavit.
