The war of words between Brandi . Glanville and her ex-husband Eddie Cibrian's new wife LeAnn Rimes has . taken a further extraordinary twist. The . Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star took Cibrian and LeAnn to task on . Wednesday night, responding to an open email from her ex with her own . abusive and hate-filled rant. In . it Brandi accused LeAnn of being a heavy drinker, addicted to . prescription drugs, having 'severe mental issues' and putting her . children in danger. She labelled the singer angelfish . 'because she sings like an angel and drinks like a fish' and told her . ex to 'man the f*** up, put the tequila down and be a proper parent.' Brandi's claims were strongly denied by a representative for the singer, who told MailOnline the reality star was' 'spewing forth inaccuracies, rants and . half-truths,' and added: 'None of Brandi’s allegations are true.  People . need to see it for what it is – publicity'. Brandi later removed the tweeted . message and admitted it had been a mistake, saying: 'I'm taking email . down I was in defense mode after seeing [Cibrian] put his online. 'Let's not talk of them anymore I was wrong 2 put it up.' Brandi's rant was just the latest in a series of exchanges between the two families. It began when an interview was published on Us Weekly on Wednesday morning  in which Brandi accused LeAnn of having a . 'severe eating disorder' and claimed her son fell ill after swallowing . one of the country star's laxatives. The 40-year-old branded LeAnn 'unstable', adding that she didn't want Mason, nine and Jake, five, to be around her alone. In the interview Brandi said: 'LeAnn has a severe eating disorder. She has [a laxative] in every purse. 'Mason, . my eldest, ate some of Le's candies and got extremely ill. And Le's . candies are laxatives,' 'It was a big f***ing deal for me, and I lost my . mind.' 'Mason found on on . the floor and thought it was a Skittle! They don't keep sugar in the . house,' Glanville explains. 'He thought he finally found candy.' She . added: 'I, unfortunately, don't find her to be stable and I don't want . her around my kids when Eddie's not there - or at least the nanny, his . parents, someone.' Defensive: LeAnn Rimes with Eddie Cibrian before the online clash with Brandi Glanville . Cibrian then responded to Brandi's interview with a public email of his own which was published on Radaronline. The 39-year-old weighed in saying: 'It is absolutely . ridiculous that my ex-wife continues to put the personal lives of . myself, LeAnn, our sons and my family on public display for the sake of . her notoriety. 'She is fully capable and has the . means of contacting myself and LeAnn privately to discuss any matter . concerning the children. 'The fact she chooses not to, should be pretty . transparent. And while I do not wish to fuel her ever-igniting fire, . there is a breaking point where enough is enough.' And he added: 'One day when wine and . narcissism are not consuming you, you will realize how fortunate the . kids are to have LeAnn in their life. She is amazing with them, as the . kids will 100 percent attest to.' He continued: 'The love they have for . their ""bonus mom"" continues to grow each day as we navigate the changes . to our family; a fact that Brandi cannot argue as she herself has stated . as much. 'If my ex-wife truly cared about the . welfare of our sons, she would stop the constant bashing on an important . person in their lives and focus on productive co-parenting to make our . blended family the strongest it can be. And she would do so privately. Let's see...' In response Brandi published her email on Twitter. LeAnn, who underwent a 30-day . treatment program for stress and anxiety in August, has previously . denied suffering from an eating disorder. The confrontation comes . less than a week after Brandi hit out at the country singer, 30, for . referring to her stepsons as 'my boys' in a Twitter post. 'They are my boys, Eddie's boys and your stepsons... for now,' a furious Brandi tweeted on November 30. She has also recently criticised LeAnn after she posted a video of one of her stepsons riding a bicycle without a helmet. Eddie dumped Brandi, his wife of nine . years, in 2009 after beginning an affair with married LeAnn on the set . of their film Northern Lights. He married the Blue singer in 2011.","Brandi started confrontation when she claimed her son got 'extremely ill from swallowing one of LeAnn's laxatives'

Guests are promised ‘unforgettable days and pleasant surprises’ in a four-star hotel combining ‘impressive luxury and elegance.’ But for more than 400 British holidaymakers, staying at the Royal Park Hotel in the Bulgarian resort of Elenite was a nightmare. Dirty conditions and appalling food hygiene proved a dangerous combination, with numerous families suffering illness and being struck down by a vomiting bug. Compensation: First Choice yesterday paid out £500,000 to be shared by 281 customers who stayed at the Royal Park Hotel in Bulgaria . Yesterday 281 holidaymakers who stayed at the hotel four years ago won a settlement of more than £500,000 from tour operator First Choice after suing the holiday company. It follows an earlier £200,000 payment to nearly 100 holidaymakers who suffered a similar fate when they stayed between 2004 and 2007 through the same holiday firm. Many of the unlucky tourists were so badly hit with gastric illness they continue to suffer from symptoms four years later. Guests at the ‘hotel from hell’ complained of flies buzzing around the food, inadequately cooked chicken, dirty crockery and cutlery in the restaurant, rude staff and unhelpful tour reps. Out of almost 300 people to receive the latest compensation payout more than 30 were so ill they required hospital treatment.

It's unlikely to win a gold with those who like their Christmas cards 'traditional'. But as the winter chill bites, David and Samantha Cameron's seasonal greetings remind us that there were a few days of sunshine this year. The Prime Minister and his wife are photographed on a bright July day waving from Number 10 as they welcome the Olympic flame to Downing Street on the eve of the London Games. David Cameron has chosen this picture of the Olympic torch, carried by Kate Nesbitt, arriving in Downing Street for his Christmas card . The PM tweeted a picture of himself signing the cards, saying it was a 'lengthy task!' The flame is carried by war hero Kate Nesbitt, whose treatment of wounded troops while under fire in Afghanistan won her the Military Cross to be awarded to a woman in the Royal Navy. Aides will hope the card will act as a reminder of the amazing summer of sport - and the mood of optimism it created. Today he tweeted a picture of himself . signing the cards on the way to visit businesses in the West Midlands. He wrote: 'Nearly finished signing my Christmas cards, a lengthy task!' The PM is a fan of summery shots in Downing Street - last year he opted for a similar photo from a Royal Wedding street party. Assuming one of his cards gets to Nick Clegg, Mr Cameron can expect to receive a more festive one in return. The Deputy Prime Minister’s cards this year feature a Santa and a grinning snowman in a collage by eight-year-old Caitlin Costello, a patient at Sheffield Children’s Hospital . Ed Miliband’s friends will be treated to a snap of him grinning along with wife Justine and their sons, Daniel, three, and Samuel, two. The picture was taken at their north London home. Labour leader Ed Miliband has a relaxed family photo on his card, featuring wife Justine and sons Daniel and Sam . Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband both chose images taken by Press Association photographer Stefan Rousseau. All three party leaders went with traditional Merry Christmas' messages inside their cards. Aides to Mr Milband revealed the thinking behind the choice of photo. 'Ed's family are at the centre of everything he does and he is looking . forward to spending time with them this Christmas,' said a party source. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who last year enlisted his own children to draw a picture, has chosen a painting by a young patient at Sheffield Children's Hospital. This seasonal collage featuring Father Christmas and a snowman by eight-year-old Caitlin Costello was picked by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for his Christmas card . Nick Clegg and wife Miriam, who are keen to keep their three children out of the spotlight, again chose not to use a photograph of their family . Eight-year-old Caitlin Costello's . collage featuring Father Christmas and a snowman won a competition to . feature on the Lib Dem leader's card. On the back of the card is the second-placed entry by Cameron Delaney, nine, and information about the work of the hospital. Mr Clegg said: 'The cards designed by the children were fantastic festive efforts. We were so impressed, we chose two - one for the front and one for the back. 'Sheffield Children's Hospital do amazing work all year round but especially for those children who have to be in hospital over the Christmas period. It's a cause very close to mine and Miriam's heart.' Last year the Cameron's chose a photo taken on at a street party to celebrate the Royal Wedding held in Downing Street . Since becoming Labour leader Mr Miliband has always chosen family portraits, opting for black and white images in 2011 (left) and 2010 (right) Last year Mr Clegg enlisted his three sons to draw a family of snowmen for his card . For the last two years Mr Clegg has enlisted his children to design his card. In 2011 the Clegg boys' felt-pen scrawl depicted the family as snowmen, each offering their best wishes for the festive season. Those wishes were 'happiness' from Mr Clegg, 'peace' from wife Miriam, 'fun and no homework' from Antonio, 'cakes and sweets' from Alberto and 'lots of presents' from two-year-old Miguel. A year earlier the Cleggs were shown as gingerbread men, but raised eyebrows because the sons showed their father on the mobile - suggesting he often had to take calls since becoming Deputy PM. It later emerged Miriam insisted the boys added the phone. Mr Clegg admitted: 'She says I spend far too much time on the blower.' Mr Clegg's 2010 Christmas card, featured his family as gingerbread characters .","Tory and Labour leaders select snaps of themselves for official greeting .

The biggest single turning point in modern history was the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Japan at the end of the Second World War, according to new research. The use of nuclear weapons to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki was more pivotal than a series of other milestones, including the events that sparked World War One and the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, according to a survey of more than 1,000 British adults. The research found that more than one in four people rated the end of the Second World War and the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 as the most significant. Total devastation: A man looks at the ruins left by the atomic bomb explosion in Hiroshima in 1945, an event which is seen as the biggest single turning point in modern history according to new research . Next most significant was 9/11 with 16 per cent of those polled rating the terrorist attacks in the U.S. as the most monumental. The bombings in Japan represent the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. An estimated 150,000 to 220,000 people were killed in the two Japanese cities. The research, commissioned by adult learning website Love to Learn, marks the release of a new online course exploring Turning Points in Modern History. The six-part course looks at the causes and effects of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand that went on to trigger World War One, along with five other historical turning points that bring people up to the present day. The research uncovers how the 50-plus generation perceives key events, spanning from the beginning of the First World War to the destruction of the World Trade Centre in 2001. While historians might long debate which events since 1900 have had the greatest impact, the people polled identified the 9/11 attacks on the United States as more significant that Hitler's rise to power in the 1930s. Nuclear annihilation: The bombings in Japan killed an estimated 150,000 to 220,000 people in the two cities and represent the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date . The Turning Points in Modern History online course is led by history author John Child who said: ‘History is not just about isolated events. It's also about understanding their causes and evaluating their effects. ‘Some famous events accelerate the pace of change but other, more momentous turning points in history create a world which is very different than it was before. ‘The fascinating thing about this course is that it creates a debate about how significant each of these famous events really was. People really enjoy arguing the case for their own view.’ Opinions varied according to age with younger respondents in their early fifties putting more significance on more recent events such as 9/11. Monumental: The next most significant point was considered to be the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City, as voted by 16 per cent of the more than 1,000 British adults who participated in the survey . Adults in their seventies were more likely to cite the start of the Second World War and Hitler's rise to power. The vast majority of those who took part in the research believed the key turning points should be taught in schools. More than three-quarters of people (77 per cent) said that the end of the Second World War and the dropping of the atomic bomb should be continued to be taught in History lessons in British schools. More than half (54 per cent) believed that the Archduke's assassination leading to the First World War should continue to be on the curriculum. Dr Sean Lang, senior lecturer in history at Anglia Ruskin University, said: ‘The research underpinning this online course suggests that different age groups, even among the over fifties, have different perspectives on this. ‘Perhaps not surprisingly, those with longer memories tend to emphasise the significance of earlier events in history. They are, after all, well placed to know.’ Older generations: Adults in their seventies were more likely to cite the start of the Second World War and Hitler's rise to power as the major turning points in modern history .","More than 1,000 British adults were surveyed .

"By . Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 21:05 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:22 EST, 4 December 2012 . A South Carolina man has won a long legal battle to gain back custody of his 21-month-old daughter after his wife placed her with an adoptive couple without telling him. Terry Achane, 31, will soon have his daughter back after a Utah judge ordered the girl's adoptive parents to return her to him within the next 60 days. In a 48-page ruling, Judge Darold McDade condemned the adoption agency that handled Achane's daughter's case for refusing to disclose any information to him nearly two years ago when he learned that his child had been given away without his consent, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Terry Achane, 31, will soon have his daughter back after a Utah judge ordered the girl's adoptive parents to return her to him within the next 60 days . Custody: A fight over custody of this baby who was unknowingly by her father put up for adoption by her birth mother in 2011 has her adoptive parents in Utah vowing an appeal on a judge's ruling to give her back . The adoptive parents, Jared and Kristi Frei, have been fighting to keep custody of the baby, whom they call Leah, and plan to appeal McDade's ruling. On a blog about the case, where the . Freis have raised more than $20,000 to help with legal bills, they . described the arrival of Achane’s daughter in their lives as 'a . righteous desire blessed to fruition by God.' 'We have not lost our conviction that . we are in the right!!!!!!' Kristi Frei wrote. 'We have only ever wanted . to do right by Leah, and have always felt we have been acting in her . best interest to keep her with our family and raise her as our own. Our . hearts have demanded it — there has never been any question to us that . she is OURS!!!' Achane, a drill instructor . in South Carolina, says it was just days after he left his pregnant wife . for his new job out of state that she quietly signed over their unborn . baby to a family of seven in Utah. Mr Achane says that he and his wife, Tira Bland, were having marital problems not long after learning she was pregnant in 2010, leading to her decision and his now spiraling struggle today despite a judge ordering the girl returned to him last October. The now ex-husband says Ms Bland had suggested having an abortion or giving their child up for adoption - fearing she would end up as a single mother - but he said no, encouraging their daughter's birth. New home: Days after Tia Bland gave birth to her daughter while her husband was working out of state, Kristi Frei, a Utah mother of six others welcomed the baby into her home knowing that the father didn't know about the adoption . It was just months later in February . of 2011 that Mr Achane found himself sent to Fort Jackson in South . Carolina for work, believing he’d leave and come back a new dad. Ten . days after his move, however, his wife went gave birth to a premature . baby and signed away their child before cutting all contact with her . husband. 'I was like, ""Utah? Where is Utah?"" I’d never been to Utah. She's never been to Utah,'"" Mr Achane told the Salt Lake Tribune of the moment he first heard the bizarre and horrifying news. Sent to live with Jared and Kristi Frei, who had spent . the last few years struggling to naturally expand their family of five . children, the baby found herself in the city of Spanish Fork. 'We knew that we were not done having . children, but after years of sudden infertility and several miscarriages . … we discovered somewhere down the line that Kristi had advanced . endometriosis, and would not likely conceive or carry another child . again,' the Frei family write of their struggle in a blog aimed at raising money for their court battle. Turning to adoption, in early 2009 the Frei family grew their family by one more with a baby boy named James. Desiring to add one more child - 'a close, similar sibling' for James - they found Mr Achane's daughter, whom they named Leah. 'Since that eventful day, we have, as a family, come to know that this dream was a righteous desire blessed to fruition by God, and that Leah would be that child - and yet, little did we know the challenges and trials that awaited us in finding and fighting for this little girl,' they wrote. Scared: The baby's mother, Tira, pictured, told the family in Utah that she was alone and scared during her baby's birth and wasn't sure if her marriage would last . The adoption agency, Adoption Center . of Choice, told the new family that Mr Achane wasn't aware of his . daughter's placement with them and that he would most likely contest it if he found out. The Tribune . reports that Ms Bland had given the adoption agency Mr Achene's former . address in Texas for contact, knowing full well at the time that he was . not living there. With the judge's recent ruling, he noted the Freis family acknowledged the risk of the father's upset but 'decided they wanted to proceed forward with the adoptive placement anyway.' Kept in the dark throughout this with months of being unable to reach his wife, Mr Achane asked a friend to visit her home in Texas who reported that the house appeared vacant. Feverishly calling anyone who may know where his wife could be, while fearing she may have carried out the abortion she once threatened to do, he learned from a family doctor that his wife was no longer pregnant but they could not legally disclose what had happened to the baby. An ounce of relief only came to the horrified man when his wife finally called him in June, telling him she had signed away their baby to the Frei family. ‘I believe she felt guilty at that point because she just made a call out of the blue,' he said of his ex-wife’s phone call. Once he learned of his daughter's fate, he immediately tried to track his little girl down but upon contact with the adoption center they refused to disclose any information on her whereabouts. The agency told the court in October that it was standard procedure to not share any information with a father of a potential adoptive child when asked. Missing: The baby's mother admitted to giving the adoption agency an incorrect address for her husband to use as contact, preventing him from finding out about his little girl's whereabouts for months . 'I am not a very religious person,' Mr Achane has since told the Tribune, 'but thou shalt not steal.' Speaking of the drawn out legal battle, he said: 'If they prolong it, that is more time away from my daughter. There are precious moments I can’t get back. ... It has been a year and a half now. There is no court order saying they have the right to my child. I just won the case. I want to get my daughter and raise my daughter,' he said. Judge Darold McDade berated the Adoption Center of Choice's handling as 'utterly indefensible.' 'This is a case of human trafficking,' Mr Achane's attorney Mark Wiser told the Tribune. 'Children are being bought and sold. It . is one thing what [adoption agencies] have been doing with unmarried . biological fathers. It is in a new area when they are trying to take a . child away from a married father who wants to have his child.' When an attorney for the Frei family contacted Mr Achane, asking him to consent to the adoption, he said no and demanded his little girl returned to him - to the Frei family's complete surprise. 'Over the last 19 months, despite the law requiring that a father show interest in his child and at least attempt regular communication to establish a bond, the father has never shown any interest in Leah other than to hire an attorney,' the family writes in their blog. Despite a judge's order to return the child within 60 days, the family now asks that his parental rights granting him custody of her be terminated. They accuse him of abandoning both the mother and baby during her pregnancy and therefore demonstrating no capability for raising the girl. 'The right of a fit, competent parent to raise the parent’s child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and constitution of this state of the United States, and is a fundamental public policy of this state,’ said Judge McDade. He added that there is no law requiring the father to 'prove himself' as fit to father his own child. 'Once Mr Achane contacted the Adoption Center of Choice ... to let them know he opposed the adoption and wanted his daughter back, that should have been the end of this case,' said Mr McDade. Not going down without a fight, the Freis vow to appeal the judge's decision, asking friends and family to support their case financially through their blog. They note having paid for 'two already expensive adoptions (each costing around $25,000),' with a continuing fight only requiring more money. Their online petition has since raised more than $20,000. A hearing has been set for January 16 of next year on the child's transition back to her father.","Judge gives adoptive couple 60 days to return daughter to natural father .

The two children were later transferred to a burns unit, where Muneeb died. Maheen remains in a critical . condition, while Dr Shakoor is being treated for severe smoke inhalation . and is ‘utterly distraught’. Police have launched a ‘major crime . investigation’ while they try to establish whether the fire was . deliberately started, and by whom. Burned out: Special fire crews attend the scene of a major house fire in Barn Mead, Harlow, Essex . Tragedy: Four children died in the blaze, aged 13, 11, nine, and six. Fire damage can be seen at the back of the house, on the brickwork and the walls are black with smoke . Among various lines of inquiry is the . theory that the Shakoor family were singled out because of issues . within the local Muslim community, in which they were reportedly very . popular. Officers stressed, however, that there is no evidence of any racial motivation. Another theory is that the Shakoors . were not deliberately targeted, and the fire was either intended for . previous tenants or started by arsonists who had attacked other cars on . the estate. Neighbours reported seeing as many as . four people in the street beforehand, and said other vehicles had been . previously targeted by arsonists in the area. Firefighters were called to the Shakoors’ rented house in Harlow, Essex, shortly before 2am yesterday. They found flames pouring from both . front and back doors and temperatures inside in excess of 1,000 degrees . Fahrenheit. Nearby a Ford Focus was also on fire. Neighbours told of ‘horrible screams’ and a woman calling for help from inside. Dr Shakoor had jumped from . the house to raise the alarm, then desperately tried to fight the flames . to get back inside to rescue his family.

Beautridge, of Essex Police said: ‘In the history of Essex Police, . seldom has there been an incident of this gravity, in which five people, . four of them children, have lost their lives.’ Ruling out any suggestion that Dr . Shakoor was involved, he continued: ‘I would like to stress that the . father of these children was in the property at the time and fought hard . to save his family in appalling conditions. ‘He, as you would expect, is in . severe shock. Our work with Dr Shakoor to establish some of the facts of . this case will, inevitably, take time because of the emotional trauma . he has suffered at the loss of his family.’ But he indicated that the answers to . the mystery lay in the local community of Harlow, and appealed to anyone . with information to come forward. Chief fire officer David Johnson said . the blaze, which started downstairs while the family was asleep . upstairs, had developed rapidly suggesting some kind of fuel and . accelerant may have been used. The family are originally from . Karachi, Pakistan, but had moved to the UK in 2009, first settling in . Winchester and then moving to Harlow just over a year ago. Both parents were doctors but while . Dr Shakoor worked at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow as an . endocrinolgist and diabetes registrar, Dr Usmani cared for their . children.

'The last time I saw my cousin was three months ago when he came back to Pakistan.

A suspected Islamic fundamentalist thought to have fought in Syria while on sabbatical from his job as an NHS doctor was in custody last night. The man was arrested with his wife at Heathrow Airport on Monday after returning to Britain from Egypt. Counter-terrorism officers suspect he was an AK-47 wielding medic among a gang of kidnappers in war-torn Syria. Hostage: British photographer John Cantlie (right) said one of his captors in Syria claimed to be an NHS doctor after he was abducted with Dutch colleague Jeroen Oerlemans (left) and held captive for a week in Syria . The man is accused of being part of a . small British contingent among a 40-strong cell called Al Absi, which . aims to convert Syria to sharia law. The group occupied a camp inside the Syrian border and took two veteran war photographers hostage on July 19. The fanatics accused the men of . working for the CIA before handcuffing and blindfolding them after they . were shot when they attempted to escape. The two hostages – John Cantlie, who . had worked for the Sunday Times, and Jeroen Oerlemans – eventually ran . away a week later with the help of the Free Syrian Army. On returning to Britain, Mr Cantlie . said a doctor with a strong London accent used a saline drip and other . equipment with NHS branding to treat a gunshot wound to his arm. Conflict: Smoke is seen billowing over shelled buildings in Saif al Dawle in Aleppo, Syria, earlier this month . Mr Cantlie said the heavily-bearded . AK-47-wielding medic, of Pakistani descent, claimed to have taken a . sabbatical from his work in London to treat injured fighters in Syria. He told the prisoners he wanted to . wage ‘holy war’ and that his experiences on the frontline would serve as . good training for a career in treating trauma injuries. The man, who said he had a wife and . child in Britain and kept his face covered with sunglasses and a scarf, . said he held a senior post at a South  London A&E department. The photographers were told during . their ordeal that two Syrians would be beheaded for spying but they were . eventually spared after repenting and promising to follow sharia law. Mr Cantlie will now be asked if he recognises the man. He previously said there were up to . 15 British nationals at the terrorist camp where the men were held in . northern Syria. On one occasion Mr Cantlie heard the doctor on the phone . to his family. ‘He was saying, “Hello babes, how’s the little ‘un? Put . him on and let me hear him.”’ At another point, the man even complained to the hostages about the state of the NHS. Mr Cantlie said: ‘I asked for his . help as we were both from London but he refused to even send a text to . my girlfriend to say we were alive. He said he would be beheaded if he . did. ‘It wasn’t much fun expecting to end . up on an execution video at the hands of extremists – one of whom was . treating Londoners like me a few months ago.’ Arrests: The two 26-year-olds were arrested by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command at 8.30pm last night after arriving on a flight into Heathrow Airport . Last night Mr Cantlie, 41, told the . Daily Mail he was aware of the arrests but that he could not comment due . to any potential on-going involvement. A source close to the investigation . said detectives have warned him he will soon be asked to view a video . identification parade. The suspected terrorist and his . 26-year-old wife were arrested after UK intelligence officers studied . medical records and interviewed health sources to try and identify him. Police are investigating whether the . woman may have flown to Egypt to meet her husband as a ‘cover’ so they . could pretend they had been on holiday when they returned at 8.30pm on . Monday. Officials believe that up to 100 British nationals have travelled to Syria to fight against Assad’s regime. Analysts say the majority of people . fighting the regime of President Bashar Assad are ordinary Syrians and . soldiers who have defected. But an increasing number of foreign fighters . with militant Islamic beliefs from countries including Britain and . France are crossing the borders. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Government is monitoring evidence of British people who want to join the conflict. A Metropolitan Police spokesman . confirmed the couple were arrested as part of an investigation into . people travelling to Syria to commit terrorist acts. He said two homes in East London were searched by officers following the arrests.","Husband and wife, both aged 26, were detained after arriving on a flight from Egypt into Heathrow at 8.30pm last night .

Former French justice minister Rachida Dati faces jail if she returns to her native Morocco after naming the father of her baby born in 2009 . France's glamorous former justice minister Rachida Dati is facing jail if she returns to her family's native Morocco for having a child out of wedlock. The 47-year-old MEP has been warned she risks up to a year behind bars for breaking the Muslim state's strict 'morality code'. The one-time French cabinet minister this week finally revealed who fathered her three-year-old daughter Zohra, and is taking him to court to force him to recognise paternity. She has named luxury hotels tycoon Dominque Desseigne, 68, as the man who got her pregnant but the admission could now cost her her freedom if she ever returns to Morocco, where her father M'Barek Dati was born and she still has dozens of relatives. Moroccan public prosecutor Adil Fath has written to justice minister Mustapha Ramid asking for her to be arrested if she sets foot in the country, the Moroccan media revealed. Dati - a french citizen born in France - is in breach of article 490 of the Moroccan penal code, which stipulates from one month to one year in prison for anyone who has sexual relations out of wedlock. The ex-minister put an end to four years of speculation this week by finally revealing who fathered her child and solved a mystery that had left two of Europe's former leaders under suspicion. Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and ex-Spanish premier Jose-Maria Aznar had both been named as among Dati's string of lovers. The man named by Dati as the father, . multi-millionaire Mr Dessiegne - boss of the Lucien Barriere hotel chain . and one of France's richest men - has so far to refused to make any . comment on Ms Dati's claims that he is the father. Cannot return: Dati cannot return without risking jail to Morocco, the country where her father M'Barek Dati (pictured right with Dati) was born and many of her relatives live . Mystery solved: Dati (left in 2009) named luxury hotels tycoon Dominque Desseigne (right) as the father putting an end to four years of speculation but the admission may put her behind bars if she returns to Morrocco for breaking the Muslim state's strict 'morality code' which forbids sexual relations out of wedlock . His name never emerged when the scandal over the possible father of the child erupted in 2008.Former Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar threatened legal action after Moroccan news site L'Observateur named him as the father. Other potential fathers named in a . frenzy of media speculation, included President Sarkozy himself, his . brother Francois and the chief prosecutor of the Arab state of Qatar, . Ali Al Marri. Named as lover: There was media speculation that former French president Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured with Dati in 2007) was the father. He used to call her 'my little Arab girl' and invited her to join his election campaign which he went on to lose in May . Former French First Lady Carla Bruni was said at the time to have accused Dati of 'sleeping her way to the top'. She was so jealous that her husband may have had a relationship with Dati that she demanded she be fired, it was reported. Sarkozy later ordered Dati to quit her justice ministry job and stand as an MEP. Former Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar (left) threatened legal action after Moroccan news site L'Observateur named him as the father while Sarkozy's partner Carla Bruni (right) accused Dati of 'sleeping her way to the top' The ex-president later invited Dati - who he used to call 'my little Arab girl' - to join his election campaign team this year hoping she would boost his appeal among France's large Muslim population but Sarkozy went on to lose the election to socialist Francois Hollande in May. The ex-president later confessed that he regretted not protecting Dati more than three years ago, adding: ‘I believed in her. She has talent.’ She is now at the centre of more speculation she will vie for the leadership of Sarkozy's right-wing UMP party to pave her way for a bid for the French presidency in either four or nine years’ time.","Rachida Dati broke Morocco's strict 'morality code' by having sexual relations out of wedlock .

A British monk has died after dousing himself in petrol and setting himself on fire at a Buddhist monastery in southern France. Venerable Lobsang Tonden, 38, who was born David Alain, may have been making a 'political gesture' against the Chinese occupation of Tibet, police said. Horrified fellow monks discovered the man ablaze at the Nalanda monastery in the village of Labastide-Saint-Georges at 5pm on Thursday. Self-immolation: Venerable Lobsang Tonden, who was born David Alain, died after setting himself on fire in France . Firefighters and police were called to the scene but were unable to save the monk's life. Gendarmerie . colonel Pierre Bouquin said: 'The man appears to have poured petrol . over his head and clothes and set himself on fire. 'He was discovered a few minutes later by other monks in a garden at the monastery. 'We . believe he may have been making a political gesture related to Tibet . but an investigation will be carried out to establish the full facts.' Protest: Images on the Nalanda monastery website show monks supporting Tibetan monks in their struggle against China - this self-immolation is suspected to be in support of Tibet . Discovery: Monks from the monastery stumbled across the Brit ablaze in the garden . Head monk the Venerable Lobsang Tendar said the victim had been at the monastery for five years but had no comment to make on the tragedy. The Nalanda monastery was set up in 1981 and has around 50 monks from 20 countries. Self-immolation by Buddhist monks occurs has occurred around 60 times since March 2011 in Tibet, as gestures of defiance against the Chinese occupation of their country and oppression of Tibetan culture and religion. Tension has risen in the past year but . Beijing insists that Tibetans have benefited from improved living . standards brought on by China and say the monks enjoy religious freedom. There has been a spate of . self-immolations in recent days with Chinese military forces mobilised . in occupied Tibet on November 8 after a trio of teenage monks set fire . to themselves. Scenic: The Nalanda monastery is located in southern France, in the village of Labastide-Saint-Georges . The boys called out for freedom . in Tibet and for the return of the Dalai Lama as they set themselves on . fire. Security forces arrived at the scene almost immediately. The youngest monk, 15-year-old Dorjee, died at the scene. His companions, 16-year-olds Samdup and Dorjee Kyab, were taken to hospital by security forces. In late October Dorjee Rinchen, 58, set himself alight outside a Chinese government building. He burned to death in Labrang, . occupied Tibet, and security forces clashed with mourners when they . attempted to bring his body back to the Gansu province, northwestern . China. Protest: Dorjee Rinchen is seen burning on the street outside the Chinese Armed Forces department in Labrang, Chinese Tibet . When Tibetan monks from the Labrang Monastery, the scene of Monday’s self immolation, later attempted to visit Mr Rinchen’s home to pray, they were stopped by security and forced to pray by the roadside. Free Tibet Director Stephanie Brigden said: 'Dorjee Rinchen is the second Tibetan to set himself on fire in Labrang in two days. 'Like many Tibetans in the last eighteen months, he set himself on fire in front of a government building that symbolises China’s occupation. 'Tibetans are paying a terrible price for the Communist Party leadership’s determination to maintain stability.'","Firefighters were unable to save the monk's life after he was discovered by fellow monks in the garden .

'These photos were taken on the orders of Closer, who asked him to sit around for several days to take them. 'For his efforts he did not earn a lot. He could have sold them for 10,000 euros. 'But in fact he was just paid his wages for going to take them. 'He didn't put them on the open market either, where he could have earned a lot more.' Another French photographer outside the Chateau d'Autet where the snaps were taken was a French woman named Valerie Suau - nicknamed The Sewer because of the pronunciation of her surname. She has admitted taking pictures of Kate in her bikini, but said she does not know who took the topless photos. The Royal couple this week won a landmark injunction preventing further distribution of the images by Closer, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine. They have also handed over all files containing the images to representatives of the couple on the orders of the judge, after they were ruled a 'brutal' invasion of privacy. The court made no ruling for the magazine to name the photographer, however, and it has the right to protect his or identity under France's laws on protection of journalistic sources. Meanwhile a criminal investigation is under way to find and prosecute the photographer - who could face a year in jail and a £36,000 fine. X marks the spot: The long lens pictures taken of the topless Duchess were shot from the side of the road between trees around half a mile away from the chateau . Yet the photos are still being touted on the open market worldwide, with magazines in Italy, Denmark and Sweden all publishing them. Closer published 13 grainy images of Kate's breasts and bottom last Thursday, branded 'grotesque and unjustifiable' by a Royal spokesman. Mr Rostain did not specifically say he knew the identity of Kate's photographer, but is known to be very well connected among the French paparazzi community. He defended the person who took them, adding: 'As a photographer, I take the pictures I want and let the publication decide whether to print them. Italian magazine Chi also published the pictures, while Michael O'Kane, editor of the Irish Daily Star, was suspended after publishing a selection that he called 'tasteful' 'What they choose to print is not the photographer's problem, but the editor's.' There are thought to be up to 200 photos taken of Kate and William at the time - many of them much more explicit. Closer magazine's editor Laurence Pieau defended her decision to publish 13 of the photos, insisting the images were 'joyous'. She said: 'These photos are not in the least shocking. They show a young woman sunbathing topless, like millions of women you see on beaches. 'They were not making any special effort to conceal themselves. Critcising our magazine is stupid.' Ms Pieau also warned also that Closer had more photos, adding: 'Intimate pictures exist that we haven't published and will not publish. Probably other newspapers will choose to publish them.'

A diet of junk food and a couch-potato lifestyle is turning the traditionally skinny French into a nation of fatties, health experts have warned. Almost seven million people in France are now classified clinically obese - nearly double the figure of 15 years ago - the latest study has revealed. Despite still being officially Europe's second thinnest people, the weight of the average French person has soared by just over half a stone to 11 stone 6lbs since 1997, the report found. The biggest weight gains were among 18 to 24-year-olds, who are becoming 'addicted to fast food', according to the government sponsored survey by pharmacists Obepi-Roche. Poorer people in the industrial areas of northern and eastern France were also twice as likely to be overweight as better off families in Paris, Brittany and the French Riviera, the study showed. France's food minister has now called for traffic light-style warning labels on all food labels to warn of high sugar, salt or fat content. Guillaume Garot also blamed food manufacturers of not 'playing the game' by presenting high calorie foods as healthy products. Changing diets: The French have switched from Bouillabaisse to French fries . He said: 'These days you virtually need a degree in chemistry to understand the nutritional information on food labels. 'We need a simpler system that simply says in three colours if a food will make you fat, if its neutral or if its healthy. 'This a a health problem that affects the whole of our society and the government will tackle it as a matter of priority.'

Furious French First Lady Valerie Trieweiler is claiming £70,000 pounds in damages over a book claiming she cheated on her husband with two lovers at once. Valerie Trierweiler was the shared mistress of left-wing President Francois Hollande and a right-wing minister while she was married, the biography called The Troublemaker claimed. The 47-year-old divorcee has now launched legal action against the authors, which exposed the details of her complicated sex life. Fury: Valerie Trierweiler, partner of France's President Francois Hollande, is suing the authors of a book over claims she was a 'shared' mistress of Hollande and conservative ex-minister Patrick Devidijan . Claims: It is alleged in the book that left-wing President Hollande knew he was 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler with Patrick Devidjian during their affair nine years ago . Her lawyer Frederique Giffard said the first lady was seeking damages for libel and breach of privacy for the 'malacious and unproven rumours aimed at sullying her character'. Ms Trierweiler also recently sued a French magazine for publishing photos of her in her bikini while on holiday with President Hollande this summer - and was awarded the 'minimum' 5,000 pounds in damages. Rumour: Patrick Devedjian allegedly had an affair with Valerie Trierweiler . The new biography claims she was having . affairs with Mr Hollande, 58, and former conservative minster Patrick . Devidjian, now 68, while still married to Denis Trierweiler nine years . ago. Both men knew they were 'sharing' Ms Trierweiler as their mistress, the book by political writers Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet says. But when Mr Devidjian refused her demands to leave his wife, she chose her affair with Mr Hollande over him, before finally divorcing her husband in 2010. The book says: ‘Patrick Devedjian hesitated so much that Valerie Trierweiler allowed herself to be courted by a second man of another political persuasion: Francois Hollande. ‘Little by little, the relationship with Hollande took precedence over the other, notably after an ultimatum in 2003 which Devedjian failed to respect.’ The case is due to be heard in a Paris court on December 10. Since becoming first lady, Ms Trierweiler has also been at the centre of accusations she tried to wreck the political career of Segolene Royal - the mother of Mr Hollande's four children. She sparked national outrage in June when she tweeted her support for a candidate standing against Ms Royal in the parliamentary elections. Ms Royal lost the election and later said she had been 'stabbed in the back' by Mr Hollande's girlfriend.

Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has escaped charges of gang rape after a vice girl told police they were playing 'sex games'. The alleged victim had changed her story to tell police that the group sex with prostitutes at an orgy in Washington DC was 'consensual', prosecutors have revealed. Strauss-Kahn, 64, had faced 20 years in prison over the claims by the prostitute named Marion that he used force against her and other girls during the sex session in December 2010. The 800 pounds-a-night hooker had told police in initial interviews last year: 'He gripped my hands, he pulled my hair, he hurt me.' She insisted he had tried to subject her to degrading acts, adding: 'I refused, telling him no. I said firmly and loudly several times that I did not want that.' But judicial officials said today that the woman had now retracted her statement. A judicial source added: 'She has retracted her deposition in a letter sent to judicial police. 'She said that in fact the sex was consensual and that the group was playing sexual games. 'The investigators, who believe they have gone as far as they can with their inquiries, have sent the file back to the prosecutors and a shelving of the inquiry will follow.' But the man once tipped as a future president of France still stands accused of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around the world. He and four other men are also charged with knowing fraudulently obtained money was being paid to the vice girls by a prostitution racket based in Lille, northern France.

Strauss-Kahn was accused of trying to rape French writer Tristane Banon in 2003. The allegations were later dropped . Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since he was arrested for trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year. After being held in New York's notorious Ryker's Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he returned to France only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. When those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with more claims he used hookers supplied by the Lille vice network. He has admitted to attending many 'swingers parties' but insisted the young women were not prostitutes and he often had sex with 'willing girls' in their 20s. His lawyer Richard Malka has described DSK as a 'simple swinger' who has committed nothing more than 'crimes of lust'. Mr Malka said his client would now do everything in his power to have the charges brought by two judges in Lille dismissed. Strauss-Kahn is now formally under 'judicial control' on £85,000 bail until judges decide whether to send him to stand trial. It also emerged this week that Strauss-Kahn may be hired by Greece to help rescue the bankrupt nation's collapsing economy. The disgraced French economist jetted to Athens to meet with government ministers last week, it was claimed. France's Europe1 radio station said: 'The Greek media is convinced he has been hired as a debt advisor. 'As the former head of the International Monetary Fund, he certainly has the qualifications.

French officials will exhume former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's remains next month in a bid to discover if he was murdered. A team of medical and forensic experts will arrive in the West Bank city of Ramallah on November 24 to carry out the gruesome operation. The exhumation comes after Arafat's widow Suha asked judges in France this summer to launch a murder probe into her husband's death. Investigation: Yasser Arafat (right) in 2004 with his wife Suha who alleges he was poisoned . Mrs Arafat, 48, believes her husband's death at a Paris hospital eight years ago was caused by the radioactive toxin polonium. She claims he was poisoned because he was an 'obstacle to peace'. Mrs Arafat launched her legal action after Swiss scientists who analysed her husband's belongings said in June that they found 'surprisingly high' levels of the lethal substance on his clothes. Palestinian authorities have now given final approval for Arafat's body to be exhumed so further tests can be carried out. Polonium-210 was also used to kill former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. Poisoned: Alexander Litvinenko was killed by polonium-210 in 2006 . Mrs Arafat's lawyer Pierre-Olivier Sud told the French media: 'Suha Arafat hopes that the authorities will be able to establish the exact circumstances of her husband's death and uncover the truth, so that justice can be done. 'She and her family want the truth and nothing but the truth. There is no question of any ideological or political exploitation.' Mrs Arafat also told arabic TV channel Al Jazeera in July that both the US and Israel had regarded her husband as 'an obstacle to peace'. She added: 'I want the world to know the truth about the assassination of Yasser Arafat.' Scene of the crime? Percy military hospital, where Mr Arafat died . Arafat had been confined by Israel to his headquarters in Ramallah when he fell ill in October 2004. He was jetted to the Percy military hospital near Paris, telling aides before he left: 'God willing, I will be back.' But less than a month after arriving, he slipped into a coma and died on November 11th, 2004. Doctors who treated him said at the time he may have died of a blood clotting disorder and ruled out poisoning. French daily Le Monde reported at the time that it had 'very good sources' who had revealed he died of a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In mourning: Suha Arafat with then French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin (right) at the funeral .

Apple has hit back in the increasingly bitter patent battle with Samsung by naming six more products in its lawsuit against its tech rival. The latest tit-for-tat move in the legal war between the two companies comes after Samsung filed papers at a US court . claiming that Apple's iPad mini, released this month, infringes . eight technology patents. Apple Inc has now asked a federal court to add six more products to its patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co, including the Samsung Galaxy Note II. The case is one of two patent infringement lawsuits pending in the U.S. District Court in San Jose by Apple against Samsung. An earlier lawsuit by Apple that related to different patents resulted in a $1.05 billion jury verdict against Samsung on Aug. 24. Tit-for-tat: Apple has added Samsung's Galaxy Note II (left) to its lawsuit after the Korean giant filed papers claiming that Apple's iPad mini, released this month, infringes eight technology patents . Apple is also seeking to add the Samsung Galaxy S III, running the new Android 'Jelly Bean' operating system, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 Wifi, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, the Samsung Rugby Pro, and the Samsung Galaxy S III Mini, to its lawsuit, according to a court filing on Friday. 'Apple has acted quickly and diligently to determine that these newly-released products do infringe many of the same claims already asserted by Apple,' the company said in the filing. Samsung representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple filed the second lawsuit in February, alleging that various Samsung smartphone and tablet products including the Galaxy Nexus infringed eight of its patents. Samsung denied infringement and filed a cross-complaint alleging that Apple's iPhone and iPad infringed eight of its patents. A U.S. judge on Nov. 15 allowed Samsung to pursue claims the iPhone5 also infringes its patents. Last week Korean giant Samsung has asked a judge to add Apple's new 7.9-inch tablet to a list of products, including the iPod Touch 5, and the iPad 4, which it claims violate patents on radio signalling technologies. The rivals have filed cases against each other in more than 10 countries, each accusing the other of violating its patents. Last week Apple successfully applied to add Google’s latest mobile operating system, Android 4.2, Jelly Bean, to the case. In a minor victory for Samsung, on Wednesday, the judge ordered Apple to disclose the financial details of its patent licensing deal with HTC. A patent war has engulfed Samsun ang Apple, with the former even forcing its rival to disclose the financial details of its patent licensing deal with HTC . Apple and HTC signed a 10-year licence agreement earlier this month, but did not make the details public. But the court ordered Apple to produce a full copy of the settlement . agreement 'without delay', subject to an 'attorneys' eyes only' designation, meaning it will not be made public. Legal experts say the question of which patents are covered by the HTC settlement, and licensing details, could be instrumental in Samsung's efforts to thwart Apple's subsequent quest for a permanent sales ban on its products. Samsung has argued it is 'almost certain' that the HTC deal covers some of the same patents involved in its own litigation with Apple. It seeks to show Apple is willing to license its technology if the price is right. It has been speculated that HTC has agreed to pay Apple a royalty of up to $8 on each smartphone it sells, but the figure has been flatly denied by the firm’s chief executive. The settlement of Apple and HTC ended their worldwide litigation and brought to a close one of the first major flare-ups in the global smartphone patent wars. Apple first sued HTC in 2010, setting in motion a legal conflagration that has since circled the globe and engulfed the biggest names in mobile technology.","Apple has added Samsung's flagship Galaxy SIII phone to its patent infringement lawsuit .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez put his full weight behind Vice President Nicolas Maduro, officially naming him his successor on Saturday after he revealed that his pelvic cancer has returned. ‘If something happens that disables me . some way, my irrevocable opinion is that you should elect Nicolas Maduro . as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,’ Chavez said in a national broadcast late Saturday night. According to Venezuelan law, Maduro would assume the presidency if Chavez is too ill to carry out his duties. He would remain there until the beginning of the new presidential term, which is January 10. Should Chavez die, elections must be held within 30 days. Scroll down for video . Successor: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, left, threw his support behind Vice President Nicolas Maduro after announcing his pelvic cancer has returned . Distraught: Supporters of Chavez rallied in the capital after the president's announcement . Vice President Nicolas Maduro, the man Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez named his successor, has been an active member of the country's government since Chavez assumed power in 1998. The 50-year-old Maduro has been close friends with Chavez since the 1980s. He got into politics as a teenager, joining the Socialist League, which sent him to Cuba for training in union organizing. He then became a union organizer in the Caracas Metro system, for which he served as a bus driver. Maduro worked as a coordinator during Chavez's first presidential election and later became a congressman and president of the assembly until 2006. As vice president, Maduro has been key in designing the country's radical anti-imperialist policy. He has worked to grow Venezuela's relationship with Iran, Russia and China. Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan government official told the Washington Post that this was Chavez saying ‘goodbye to power.’ ‘It’s a statement full of resignation . and appeals to God,’ he said. ‘There is no plan. The only talk of the . future is that there will be elections and he asks for people to vote . for Maduro.’ Meanwhile, Henrique Capriles Radonski, . who lost to Chavez in October, wished the president well but urged . people to ‘embrace democracy.’ ‘Venezuela does not have succession,’ he . said. ‘This is not Cuba nor is it a monarchy that has a king. Here in . Venezuela, when someone leaves a position, the people get the last . word.’ The 50-year-old Maduro is a former union . organizer and bus driver who has rose steadily through the ranks of . Venezuelan government. He is one of the founding members of the . political party that was the precursor to Chavez’s current party. In some circles, Maduro is considered . one of the strongest voices behind the country’s radical . anti-imperialist policy moves and the man responsible for strengthening . ties with Libya, Syria and Iran. Hugo Chavez, (left), speaks to Cuba's President Raul Castro, (center), before the South American leader departed Cuba for Venezuela on Friday . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez . announced Saturday night that his cancer has returned and that he will . undergo another bout of surgery in Cuba. Chavez, . who won re-election on October 7th, also said for the first time that . if his health were to worsen, his successor would be Maduro. 'We should . guarantee the advance of the Bolivarian Revolution,' Chavez said on . television, seated at the presidential palace with Maduro and other . aides. The president said that tests had . shown a return of 'some malignant cells' in the same area where tumors . were previously removed. He said he would return to Cuba on Sunday to . undergo surgery in the coming days. Chavez called it a 'new battle.' It is to be his third operation to remove cancerous tissue in about a year and a half. The . 58-year-old president first underwent cancer surgery for an unspecified . type of pelvic cancer in Cuba in June 2011, after an operation for a . pelvic abscess earlier in the month found the cancer. He . had another cancer surgery last February after a tumor appeared in the . same area. He has also undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Victory lap: Hugo Chavez waves a Venezuelan flag while speaking to supporters after receiving news of his reelection in Caracas . Celebration: A Chavez supporter revels in the streets after the vote in October . Chavez made his most recent trip to . Cuba on the night of November 27th, saying he would receive hyperbaric . oxygen treatment. Such treatment is regularly used to help heal tissues . damaged by radiation treatment. Chavez said that he has been coping with pain and that while he was in Cuba thorough exams detected the recurrence of cancer. He . arrived back in Caracas on Friday after 10 days of medical treatment in . Cuba, but until Saturday night had not referred to his health. His . unexplained decision to skip a summit of regional leaders in Brazil on . Friday had raised suspicions among many Venezuelans that his health had . taken a turn for the worse. Chavez . said that he was requesting permission from lawmakers to travel to . Havana and that he hoped to have good news after the surgery. This . news comes just two months after Chavez drafted tanks and soldiers . wielding AK-47s onto the streets of Caracas as he won a historic third . re-election after almost 14 years in office. The decision marked the end of a bitter campaign in which the opposition . accused him of unfairly using Venezuela's oil wealth and his near total . control of state institutions to his advantage. Chavez rallied thousands of supporters from a balcony of the presidential palace as he declared victory, holding up a sword that once belonged to 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar. 'The revolution has triumphed!' Chavez told the crowd, saying his supporters 'voted for socialism.' The crowd responded chanting 'Chavez won't go!' The election triumph gave Chavez a freer hand to push for an even bigger state role in the economy and continue populist programs. Six more years: The win gives Chavez another term to cement his legacy and press more forcefully for a transition to socialism in the country with the world's largest proven oil reserve . Jumping for joy: Supporters of Hugo Chavez celebrate in the streets as the longtime president won re-election . He pledged before the vote to make a . stronger push for socialism in the next term. He's also likely to . further limit dissent and deepen friendships with U.S. rivals. A victory for his opponent Henrique Capriles would have brought . a radical foreign policy shift including a halt to preferential oil . deals with allies such as Cuba, along with a loosening of state economic . controls and an increase in private investment. Good feeling: Chavez gestures to supporters after casting his vote during the election in Caracas . During the election Chavez's critics said the president has inflamed divisions by labeling his opponents 'fascists,' 'Yankees' and 'neo-Nazis,' while Chavez backers alleged Capriles would halt generous government programs that assist the poor. The news of the return of his cancer is a big blow for his supporters in South America's biggest oil exporter, who elected him in October to a new six-year term in power. Chavez has twice said he was cured, and then had to return to Cuba for more surgery. In a televised broadcast flanked by ministers at the Miraflores presidential palace, Chavez said that if anything happened to him and a new vote had to be held, his supporters should vote for Vice President Nicolas Maduro - the first time the socialist leader has named a successor. Chavez returned to Venezuela on Friday from having medical treatment in Cuba, ending a three-week absence from public view. 'Unfortunately, during these exhaustive exams they found some malignant cells in the same area ... . It is absolutely necessary, absolutely essential, that I have to undergo a new surgical intervention,' the 58-year-old said, looking resolute. 'With God's will, like on the previous occasions, we will come out of this victorious.' The president has already had three cancer operations in Cuba since the middle of last year. News of more surgery will likely raise new doubts about his future and the fate of his self-styled 'revolution' in the OPEC nation. Chavez, who has dominated Venezuelan politics since taking power 14 years ago, said he would return to Havana on Sunday. Under Venezuela's constitution, an election would have to be held within 30 days if Chavez were to leave office within the first four years of his next term, due to begin on January 10. The president has been receiving treatment at the Cimeq hospital in Havana as a guest of his friend and political mentor, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

Devious: Adrian Callen, 57, repeatedly lied to officials, claiming he had no income other than benefits and just £250 in savings . Devious Adrian Callen, 57, claimed he had no income other than benefits and had just £250 in savings. But the grandfather was actually raking in thousands of pounds in rent from ten flats he had bought across the South West, worth around £100,000 each. Bristol Crown Court heard how he renovated the properties and used rent to pay for huge mortgages he had taken out on them during the eight-year scam. His property empire - which he began to build in 2002 - is now crippled with £800,000 of mortgage debt due to the crash in the housing market, the court was told. Callen, of Bedminster Down, Bristol, was caught out when one of his tenants applied for benefits and officials launched an investigation into the landlord's own finances. He was arrested and later admitted nine counts of fraud, telling police he had been buying properties as a 'chance to better himself'. His honour Judge Julian Lambert jailed Callen for six months, calling him a 'greedy' cheat . He said: 'Your offending continued over a period of about eight years. Eventually you came to own 10 properties and received rent from those. 'You had a gross worth of hundreds of thousands of pounds. 'What you did was deliberate and greedy. Yours was one of the worst types of this fraud. This behaviour makes honest folk who struggle to get by feel sick. 'Your behaviour incites ill feeling . towards genuine benefit claimants who deserve sympathy and compassion. Your claim was fraudulent from the outset.' Bristol . Crown Court heard how Callen first began claiming council tax benefits . for his three-bedroomed detached house in Bristol after his estranged . wife moved out. Investment: Callen bought three flats in Glenwood Mansions, Weston-Super-Mare, between 2004 and 2006, costing £259,000 in total. Big spender: In December 2005 Callen purchased a flat at Weston Lodge in Bristol for £113,000 . Empire building: Callen snapped up a £122,000 flat in this Knightstone Road block, Weston-super-Mare, in January 2006 . Callen . started claiming the cash when he became the sole carer for his then . four-year-old grandson after social services told him he would have to . quit his job to care for the boy. He signed forms stating that he had no savings, properties or investments - despite £29,000 in savings he had stashed in a bank account. But in April 2003 he purchased a flat in Splott in Cardiff for £38,000 without a mortgage and sold it a year later, in July 2004, for £107,000. Callen continued to claim benefits - each time stating that he had no savings other than £250 and owned no properties other than his home address. In November 2004, Callen bought a flat at Glenwood Mansions in Weston-super-Mare for £67,500, purchasing another flat there in August 2005 for £71,500. The following December, Callen purchased a flat at Weston Lodge in Bristol for £113,000. He snapped up a flat for £122,000 in Knightstone Road, Weston-super-Mare, in January 2006 and bought another flat at Glenwood Mansions in the town for £120,000 in February. In June 2006, Callen paid £102,000 for a flat on Meadow Street in Avonmouth. Along with his son, Callen took out three mortgages worth £300,000 to purchase three flats at Warden Road in Bristol in February 2007. His final purchase was a flat on Locking Road in Weston-super-Mare for £86,000. Callen secured huge mortgages for the properties by telling lenders he had an income of £31,000 - £16,000 from a retirement fund and £15,000 from renting. Alan Fuller, prosecuting, told the court that Callen repeatedly lied about his income, savings and investments as well as telling officers he did not own any properties. But the landlord finally came clean when he was arrested in February 2011 after one of his tenants submitted a benefits claim. His fraud was revealed to be £59,886 in come support, £8,923 in council tax allowance and £4,882 in Jobseeker’s Allowance. Mr Fuller said: “He said social services had completed the forms initially and he had simply signed them. “He thought there was nothing wrong about owning properties. He said he had no money after leaving work and took a chance to better himself. Entrance to Weston Lodge, where Callen bought a flat in 2005 for £113,000 . “He admitted he owned ten properties that he rented out. The rent was paid into his bank account. “He said he knew he had done wrong and he would take it on the chin.” Callen, who has a previous conviction for obtaining a property by deception in 1992, has been repaying the amount he fraudulently claimed, the court heard. But his finances have been left 'in the red' - with his properties 'mortgaged to the hilt' with £800,000 outstanding. He is currently £5,000 overdrawn, while his credit cards are 'maxed out'. Buy-to-let: Callen spent £259,000 on three flats in Glenwood Mansions, Weston-super-Mare . Timothy Rose, mitigating, said: 'He is mortgaged to the hilt. He is in an utter mess. It is estimated that he owes up to £800,000 in mortgage debt. 'Some if not all of these properties are in negative equity. He is being pursued by bailiffs and he has handed me a whole sequence of red letter demands. 'He is not in fact a sophisticated man despite what he has done.' He said Callen suffers from depression, fully accepts responsibility for his actions and has already started paying back his ill gotten gains.

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 20:19 EST, 31 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:18 EST, 1 November 2012 . Plans to force women to undergo independent counselling before they could have an abortion were dramatically scrapped yesterday. Health minister Anna Soubry revealed that the Government now has no intention of changing either the law or guidelines on counselling – despite previous promises to consult on the issue. The move was met with fury by pro-life campaigners, who accused Miss Soubry of imposing her personal beliefs on government policy. Decision: Health minister Anna Soubry revealed that the Government now has no intention of changing either the law or guidelines on counselling ¿ despite previous promises to consult on the issue . Tory MP Nadine Dorries said it was ‘bizarre’ to scrap a consultation on plans to prevent clinics, such as those run by Marie Stopes and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, from offering counselling to women at the same time as carrying out  terminations. She said there was a conflict of interest as many pregnant women who seek advice from clinics go on to have abortions. Instead, campaigners say ministers should have rubber-stamped proposals forcing women to take advice from counselling services separate from the clinic they had chosen to carry out their abortion. Miss Soubry’s surprise intervention comes only weeks after the newly-appointed minister spoke out in favour of legalising assisted suicide. Health minister Anna Soubry, left, revealed that the Government now has no intention of changing either the law or guidelines on counselling.  Tory MP Nadine Dorries, right, said it was ‘bizarre’ to scrap a consultation . During a debate in Westminster Hall, she said she had decided to call off the consultation because the Government had no intention of changing the law – adding that if ministers were to plough on regardless it would be an ‘otiose exercise’. ‘There is other work we should be doing on counselling,’ she said. But Mrs Dorries accused Miss  Soubry of imposing her views on  policy. ‘What Anna Soubry has said today doesn’t improve services for women,’ she said. Scrapped: Women will not be forced to undergo counselling . ‘The Government has decided that it is not the right decision. ‘This announcement comes down to Anna Soubry’s very personal belief on abortion. She is as pro-choice as many Labour women MPs. ‘[Health Secretary] Jeremy Hunt believes in a 12-week limit but he is not trying to push his agenda on women because he acknowledges it is his personal belief. ‘What she has done is try to impose her personal belief on her role and that is out of order,’ she added. A spokesman for BPAS – which would have had to send women  seeking an abortion to a separate counsellor under the plans – said: ‘Current abortion counselling arrangements serve women well, and so BPAS is pleased to see the Government has dropped its plans to unnecessarily overhaul services. ‘Calls to do so had been driven by a handful of MPs with an anti-abortion agenda who wished to create barriers in women’s access to care. ‘BPAS hopes that government  policy can now focus on efforts to support women trying to prevent pregnancy, and ensure the highest quality care for those who do need abortion services.’ In a statement released after the debate by the Department of Health, Miss Soubry said: ‘The most  important thing is that women get the help they need during a difficult time in their lives. ‘We consider that this important issue can be most effectively addressed by considering counselling alongside all aspects of unplanned pregnancy rather than separately.’","Anna Soubry revealed that the Government now has no intention of changing either the law or guidelines on counselling .

Controversial: Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has backed calls for the abortion limit to be cut to 12 weeks . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night made a provocative call for the abortion time limit to be slashed from 24 weeks to just 12 weeks. Mr Hunt said he had not changed his mind since 2008, when as a member of the Shadow Cabinet he voted in the Commons to halve the upper limit at which a woman can opt for a termination. As a newly appointed Health Secretary, many would have expected him to adopt a more independent line – but he has opted to be the first politician in the position for years to express such an extreme view. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) called the Health Secretary’s intervention ‘insulting to women’. Earlier this week, new women’s minister Maria Miller also called for a reduction in the upper time limit, albeit to just 20 weeks. In an interview with The Times newspaper, Mr Hunt denied that his stance was a consequence of his Christian beliefs. ‘Everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is, and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it,’ he said. ‘It’s just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start. I don’t think the reason I have that view is for religious reasons.’ Mr Hunt said it was for Parliament, not the Government, to determine the law on moral issues such as abortion. ‘There are some issues that cut across health and morality, a bit like capital punishment does for crime,’ he said. About 91 per cent of abortions happen before 12 weeks. But opponents said a 12-week limit would effectively end testing for conditions such as Down’s syndrome. RCOG spokeswoman Kate Guthrie said: ‘The politicisation of women’s health is absolutely shocking. Politicians talk about putting patients at the centre, which is quite right. How is the woman at the centre of her healthcare with something like this? ‘If everybody had to have abortions by 12 weeks, my worry would be that women would be rushed into making decisions. That’s an absolute shocker. You will absolutely create mental health problems if you start dragooning women into making decisions before they have to.’ Clare Murphy, head of public policy for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: ‘What’s disconcerting about people like Jeremy Hunt is that they don’t seem to understand why women would need later services. These are often vulnerable women. 'Insulting to women': The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) said a 12 week limit would prevent testing for conditions such as Down's syndrome . ‘They completely fail to engage with the reality of people’s lives and their take on science seems completely wrong.’ Downing Street sought to play down the provocative remarks. A source said: ‘Mr Hunt was expressing a personal view and there are no plans to make time in government business for a vote on the issue. ‘Given the strong views of most Labour and Lib Dem MPs against any reduction, whatever Tory MPs think it seems unlikely that there will be a change in the law.’ Last week, pro-choice activists delivered 600 coat hangers – used by desperate women to terminate their babies before 1967 when abortion was decriminalised – to Mr Hunt’s office to urge him to ditch his support for a lower time limit. In an interview during the election campaign, David Cameron said: ‘My own view is that we do need to review the abortion limit. ‘I think that the way medical science and technology have developed in the past few decades mean that an upper limit of 20 or 22 weeks would be sensible.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Parliamentary practice is that any proposals to change abortion laws come from backbench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes.’","Cutting the 24 week abortion limit to 12 would prevent testing for conditions such as Down’s syndrome .

Tragedy: Ana Hernandez, 32, fell in love with Darren Stott, 42, in Gran Canaria, and moved to South Yorkshire with him. A pregnant lawyer who died from an apparent overdose had told friends she feared her fiancé was trying to kill her, an inquest heard. Ana Hernandez, 32, was found dead on her bed at the home she shared with Darren Stott. A post-mortem examination revealed a cocktail of drugs – none of which had been prescribed to her – in her system. Tests also revealed the drugs may have been mixed into a spicy stew which she had eaten. Police initially concluded there was nothing suspicious about the death as she had been given paracetamol for a headache despite her strong opposition to the idea. But now a coroner has dramatically adjourned the hearing into her death so that police can look into ‘very important’ claims that she believed she was being poisoned by her university lecturer fiancé, who was described as a ‘control freak’. The coroner’s office was recently unable to contact Mr Stott, 42, who moved to the Canary Islands – where the couple originally met – after her death in June and he did not attend the inquest on Thursday. Friends and relatives of the Spaniard, who was four months pregnant, were stunned by her sudden death as she was a fitness fanatic and vehemently opposed to taking medication during pregnancy. Her family insisted the staunch Roman Catholic would never have taken her life. The inquest heard Mr Stott, who lectured at Leeds Metropolitan University, met Miss Hernandez in April 2011. She proposed to him on February 29 and moved in March to live with him in the village of Barnburgh, near Doncaster. A statement from Mr Stott said said when she found out she was pregnant ‘I was extremely happy and so was Ana’. In early June the couple visited the home of local friends, Geoff and Carolyn Telford, for a drink. Mr Telford said: ‘She told me, “Darren is trying to kill me. He’s trying to make me take drugs.” She wasn’t very happy.’ Mrs Telford said Miss Hernandez complained of a headache and said: ‘He’s trying to kill me with these drugs.’ The inquest was told Mr Stott travelled to Berkshire to attend a course on June 26. His fiancee’s body was found two days later at their three-bedroom bungalow after Mr Stott asked the Telfords to check on her. Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna said ‘very high’ levels of paracetamol, tramadol, codeine and cyclizine  were found in her stomach. Each of the drugs on their own would have been enough to kill her. She had died after eating a highly-spiced stew and the pathologist said there was evidence to suggest the tablets could have been ground down. Discovery: Ms Hernandez's semi-naked body was found on a bed at the three-bedroom bungalow home she shared with university lecturer and partner Mr Stott in the village of Barnburgh, near Doncaster . The coroner has ordered further . toxicology tests to shed more light on how she died. The inquest heard . tablets were found in every room in the house, all prescribed to Mr . Stott for a variety of ailments. Asked about Mr Stott, Detective Sergeant . David Roberts told the inquest: ‘There was just something about him . that made me feel uncomfortable.’ Miss Hernandez’s brother Rafael, 42, . who lives in the Doncaster area, said Mr Stott was a ‘control freak’ who . wanted to know her every movement. Coroner Nicola Mundy adjourned the . inquest in Doncaster and said: ‘I am far from satisfied with what I have . heard. Very important matters have come out which need to be pursued.’ She said there were ‘glaring inconsistencies’ in Mr Stott’s account. New life: Ms Hernandez moved to the village of Barnburgh (pictured), South Yorkshire, to live with Mr Stott who she met in Gran Canaria.

"Since March 2011, around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire in protest against the Chinese occupation of Tibet . By . Matt Blake . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:37 EST, 5 December 2012 . Martyr: Sangay Dolma betrays nothing in this picture of her plan to set herself on fire in the name of home and country . Peering thoughtfully into the camera, her mouth curved into the faintest of smiles, 17-year-old Sangay Dolma looks the picture of youthful promise. But by the time she took this photograph in the darkness of her bedroom, her plans were already in motion to travel to a Chinese government office building in eastern Tibet, douse herself in petrol and light a match. The only clue to her final act are the haunting words, scrawled roughly on her hand in Tibetan script: 'Tibet is an independent nation'. By then she knew this act of self-immolation . would be her last, so she left a will in an envelope, alongside this . picture, written in the form of a poem. At the head of the note, she wrote: 'Beloved children of the Snow Lion, sons . and daughters of the Land of Snows, warriors of the snow mountain, don’t . forget your are Tibetans.' She . became the latest of a string of young Tibetans to set fire to . themselves in the name of independence when she took her life in a ball . of flame on November 26. Since . March 2011, around 90 people are known to have set themselves on fire . in protest against the Chinese occupation of Tibet. There were 25 in . November alone, according to campaigners. This . wave of self-immolations reveal . the desperation among Tibet's youth after 60 years under Beijing's . thumb and underlie a harsh crackdown in recent years by the Chinese . government any who dare question its sovereignty over the mountain . nation. Until her tragic and violent death, Sangay Dolma had been a nun at the Gonshul Nunnery near the Sangag Mindrol . Dhargeyling Monastery. She left a note with the picture, in Tibetan script, which included the words: 'Look up, Tibetans, look at the snow mountains. The snowland’s era has begun. And Tibet is free and independent' There she would have been well . schooled in Buddhist teachings, in particular its emphasis on . non-violence, even in the face of conflict. Indeed, the first of the five precepts that all Buddhists should follow is 'avoid killing, or harming any living thing'. Her death serves as a stark reminder . of the passion that fuels this spate of self immolations and . the lengths young people in Tibet are prepared to go in order to raise . awareness of their region's plight. She goes on with a call to arms to her countrymen to join her fight for a free Tibet. Sangay Dolma's name joins a rapidly growing list . of young Tibetans so angry at their Chinese rulers that they are willing to . make the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to draw the world's attention to their region's plight. Self immolations in Tibet have become so common that they happen on an almost daily basis. Already since Sangay Dolma's death, on November 26, nine Tibetans have followed suit as calls for an independent . Tibet continued to echo throughout the world, according to campaign group Free Tibet. In November, 25 protesters - aged . between 15 and 30 - set themselves on fire, following ten such cases in October. And on Sunday, 17-year-old Sangdak Kyab, set himself on fire near the Bhora Monastery in Sangchu County. He is believed to have survived and was taken away by Chinese police. The . first stanza reads: 'Look up, fellow Tibetans, look at the blue . twilight above, Like a heavenly tent of white mountain, My lama has . returned.' In the fourth . stanza, goes on: 'Look up, Tibetans, look at the snow mountains. The . snowland’s era has begun. And Tibet is free and independent.' In . the two closing stanzas, she pays tribute to the Dalai Lama and the . Panchen Lama, who has been missing since 1995, spirited away by the . Chinese government at the age of six after he was officially named the . reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama. 'His Holiness the Dalai Lama, when he . lived far away, he travelled around the world, praying for the end of . suffering of the red-faced Tibetans, and released us from darkness, at a . time when Panchen Lama is in prison, he looks out from his prison cell, . prays for ""the dawn of peace and happiness in my land of snow"".' She becomes the sixth person to set herself on fire in Tibet in as many weeks. The . Chinese government has sought to crack down on Tibetan dissidents . issuing a stern warning to the authorities of eastern Tibet to punish . all self-immolators and their relatives - and even those who send . condolences to bereaved families. It . said all government aid would be removed from the families of . self-immolators while development projects in communities that have been . home to such protesters would be cancelled.

'Free Tibet is receiving reports of protests inside Tibet on an almost daily basis. These protests will only continue until each and everyone one of us stands with the Tibetan people in their struggle for freedom and our Governments stop kowtowing to an unelected Chinese regime.'

A pair of Muslim NFL stars have sacrificed their million-dollar paychecks and quit their top-flight American football teams - to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Brothers Hamza and Husain Abdullah are at the peak of their careers, playing every week in front of tens of thousands of cheering fans at the heart of two of America's top gridiron teams. But in June this year, the pair broke the news to their respective coaches that they would not be available to play in the 2012 NFL season because they were taking their ailing parents on a 7,000-mile 'road trip' to Islam's spiritual heartland. Lifelong Muslims Hamza, 29, a first-team starter for the . Arizona Cardinals and Husain, 27, of the Minnesota Vikings, have enjoyed . highly successful careers in American football, climbing the ranks from . little leagues, to high school and college football to the NFL. Faith: Hamza Abdullah (left), 29, left the Arizona Cardinals while his brother Husain (right), 27, quit the Minnesota Vikings to make the trip to Islam's religious heartland in October . High flyers: Hamza (left) and Husain (right) both earn around a million dollars a year as NFL players . But in a country so polarised by perceptions of faith, both say they have experienced Islamophobic abuse on and off the field. Far from accept it as an inescapable byproduct of multiculturalism, however, it inspired them to use their high-profile status to educate fellow Americans in a bid to nurture a better understanding of their faith. 'You . know,' Hamza told NBC News. 'We're playing football, America's number one game. We went on a road trip. What's more American than a road trip?' Born and bred in tough South Central Los Angeles, the brothers say no amount of success . could satisfy their aching desire to honour the most demanding of the . five pillars of Islam - The Hajj. On the flight: They swapped their gridirons for 'ihrams' as they made the 7,000-mile journey . Loyal: Brothers Hamza (far left) and Husain (far right) Abdullah took their ailing parents on the 7,000-mile trip to Islam's religious heartland in October after telling their coaches they would not be available to play in the 2012 NFL season . In the crowds: The brothers swapped their on-field body armour for traditional Islamic clothing designed to make it impossible to tell who is rich and who is poor . It . is a journey all able-bodied Muslims are required to make at least once . in their lifetime and is the largest spiritual pilgrimage in the world. 'We’ve been playing football since we were 8 years old,' Husain told NBC News. 'And although we're knocking down all these barriers, doing things that . people said you can't do, all of a sudden, it was like there's more to . life than this. There's more. And we had to go for it.' The brothers decided to take with . them their mother, a teacher, and ailing father, a former carpenter . whose chronic diabetes leaves him needing daily dialysis treatment. Popular: The brothers in Mecca with a group of Saudi NFL fans . Celebrity: Even in Mecca the borthers were recognised by NFL fans (pictured: Hamza and a young fan) The Kaaba: The Hajj is one of the largest spiritual pilgrimages in the world and is embraced by nearly two million people each year . But before . they embarked on the mission, they spent 30 days . travelling America, having 'Iftar' - the daily Ramadan fast-breaking . meal - at a different mosque each night while giving talks on . fasting and its impact on athletes. The journey that followed was a far cry from the luxury they had become accustomed to as coveted sports stars in their homeland. The Hajj is one of the largest spiritual pilgrimages in the world and is embraced by nearly two million people each year. Many make the journey to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, as it is laid down in the Qu'ran that the journey is a duty that must be carried out at least once by every able bodied Muslim, provided they can afford it. It takes place during the last month of the Islamic year, known as Dhu’l Hijja and once there pilgrims are required to walk seven times around Mecca's most sacred site, the Kaaba, a cuboid shaped building in the centre of the holy city. Although pilgrimages to Mecca are thought to date as far back as 2.000BC, it is believed that the first hajj, in which the prophet Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca, was performed by Muslims alone in the 7th century. Once there Muhammad is said to have cleansed the Kaaba and re-ordained the building as the house of God. From this point the hajj became one of the Five Pillars of Islam. The other four pillars are Shahadah, a statement recited in Arabic, the Salat, five daily prayers, the ritual fasting of the Sawn of Ramadan and the Zakat, a charitable donation. It involved travelling in packed buses . for many hours on end, bustling through vast crowds and sleeping on the . floors of makeshift accomodation erected to help house the two million . pilgrims that visit Mecca every year. First . they traveled by plane to Saudi Arabia then made a series of long-haul . bus journeys - some of which became stuck in traffic jams of up to 12 . hours at a time - before completing their journey on foot. They also swapped their on-field body armour for the requisite 'ihram', a garment of two sheets of white, unhemmed cloth worn by pilgrims to make it impossible to tell who is rich and who is poor. Hamza said the trip shattered any preconceptions he had about negative foreign feeling towards the US. He said the first thing he noticed was 'how much the other Muslims we met love Americans'. He said he was ambushed by a surprising and overwhelming sense of pride at being American. But it has not always been so. Both men have found themselves victims of Islamophobic abuse both on and off the field, especially since 9/11 rocked the nation. But far from roll over and accept the wave of anti-Muslim sentiment that swept the country in the wake of the attack, they saw it as an opportunity to use their status as high-profile sports stars to educate their fellow Americans in a bid to nurture a better understanding of their faith. Hamza said he believes 9/11 was an 'educational opportunity' that 'opened the eyes of a lot of people' and forced many Americans to ask questions about a faith of which many knew next to nothing. He said: '[People] would ask: ""Can you guys . kill people?"" And I would ask them: ""In what book does it say that you . can go and do acts of terrorism?"" The Quran doesn’t say that. Islam is a . religion of peace.' Since taking their leave of absence, both brothers are now free agents, with no certainty of a future in the NFL. Indeed, in a country so polarised by . perceptions of faith, would this overt celebration of their religious beliefs . hinder their return to big league American football? They think not. 'A lot of the times [the concept of being Muslim and American] gets lost in translation,' Hamza said. 'Islam is our religion, yes.  But . our country is the United States of America.' In action: Hamza (right) tackles Virgil Green of the Denver Broncos in a during the preseason NFL game at the University of Phoenix Stadium in September 2011 . Early years: Hamza (left) and Husain (right) have enjoyed highly successful careers in American football, climbing the ranks from little leagues, to high school and college football to the NFL, but never forgot their roots . Happy family: Hamza and Husain (back center left and right) have ten brothers and sisters. Pictured with their mother and father, centre front . And their former clubs have been encouraging.

'The bodies are decomposed badly,' a police spokesman said, adding that Korean writing on the hull was impossible to read. The boat was found around 9am on Wednesday by local fishermen. It had been so battered by the elements that it was barely afloat by the time it washed ashore. Investigation: Various belongings and rubbish from food packaging was also found scattered inside, suggesting its occupants may have been attempting to flee the world's most secretive nation but became lost at sea . Mystery: The bodies on board the boat were so decomposed that it may take some time to identify them, police said .

Details were not yet known, including when the five died. In January, the coast guard found three people adrift in a small boat off the Sea of Japan coast. The three North Koreans and another man, who had died of hypothermia, were originally thought to be defectors from the communist state. But they told officials their boat had developed engine trouble during a fishing trip and they had unintentionally drifted. They were later repatriated.

The canal is nowadays mostly used by tourist ships as cargo vessels have grown too big over the ages. It was conceived in 620 BC by the Tyrant of Corinth. But he was over-ruled by the Oracle of Delphi who feared upsetting Poseidon, the sea god, and so built a roadway instead. Around 300 years later, Demetrios, the Macedonian king, began building the canal, but it was the Roman emperor Nero who, in 66 AD, moved the work into top gear by importing 6,000 prisoners from Galilee to do the digging. He was sentenced to death two years later, bringing work to a halt. Short cut: The Corinth Canal is a man-made waterway that cuts through Greece between the Aegean sea to the east and the Ionian to the west . Some 1,600 years after that, the Venetians, who then controlled the Peloponnisos, took up the baton. But it was not until 1869 that Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French architect of the Suez Canal, came along and finished it off in 11 years.

The vast sum is three . times more than the $54 million previously disclosed, and 50 percent . more than the $100 million Adelson once said he was prepared to spend. His apparent aim was to unseat Obama and help Republican lawmakers take back control of Congress after the November 6 elections, but his spending failed with Obama defeating Mitt Romney and the Democrats retaining the Senate. Power: The 79-year-old tycoon, who owns a number of casino resorts across the world, funded several Republican candidates and affiliated groups during the race for the White House . The money bankrolled groups ostensibly working against Obama and in support of Republican presidential nominee Romney and other candidates who ran for Congress against members of the Democratic Party. Adelson, whose fortune is estimated at . $20 billion by Forbes magazine, is also being investigated by the US Justice . Department over how his casino network is operated. During the election he revealed in an interview that the Justice Department investigation, on top of the way he felt treated by prosecutors, was his the driving force behind the investment. He has also said that a second Obama term would bring 'vilification of people that were against (Obama)'.

Last week, his company reportedly approved a special dividend of $1.2 billion for Adelson and his wife - they own around 52 percent of Las Vegas Sands Corp. - in advance of an expected federal tax hike. The two fundraisers quoted by the Huffington Post said Adelson shelled out between $30 million and $40 million to Crossroads GPS, a campaign group run by Karl Rove, former Republican president George W. Bush's top political aide. He also paid at least $15 million to grassroots efforts with financial links to Charles and David Koch, the online news portal reported as well as $5 million to the US Chamber of Commerce and the Republican Jewish Coalition, which got the lion's share of its $6.5 million budget from him, it was said. While US law places limits on the amounts that can be given directly to political candidates, a Supreme Court ruling in 2010 allows corporations, unions and individuals to make unlimited donations to arms-length groups. The Citizens United ruling led to the creation of super-PACS (political action committees), such as GPS, that spent millions of dollars on campaigning though it was not officially endorsed by a specific candidate. Adelson's company faces two investigations into its practices, though the charges do not directly concern him. First is a money laundering investigation probing whether the casino broke the law by failing to . report millions of dollars of potentially laundered . funds that two gamblers transferred to its casinos. The other involves allegations that Adelson’s lucrative casinos on the Chinese island of Macau may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by paying bribes to Chinese officials to expand its operations there.","The 79-year-old tycoon funded several Republican candidates and affiliated groups during the .

Banned sports drug EPO - allegedly used by Lance Armstrong - may not enhance performance at all, experts say . The banned sports drug allegedly used by cycling legend Lance Armstrong - may not enhance performance at all, experts say. And using the hormone erythropoietin, known as EPO, may actually put the lives of unscrupulous sportsmen at risk, they have  warned. The drug is banned from sports because it is believed to give users an edge over their competitors by improving oxygen delivery to their muscles. The USA’s anti-doping agency said EPO was used by Armstrong. But now researchers writing in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology say there is no scientific evidence that it does enhance performance, but there is evidence that using it in sport could place a user’s health and life at risk. Professor Adam Cohen, from the Netherlands Centre for Human Drug Research, said: 'Athletes and their medical staff may believe EPO enhances performance, but there is no evidence that anyone performed good experiments to check if EPO would actually improve performance in elite cyclists.' He added that the potential harm arose from the fact EPO thickens the blood, adding to the risk of clots. These can obstruct blood flow to areas of tissue, meaning oxygen doesn’t get to the cells and they die, damaging the organ. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a naturally-occurring hormone, produced by the kidneys, that stimulates the production of red blood cells.This is said to improve endurance. However the hormone can also be manufactured and injected into the skin or directly into the blood stream. EPO may be used in medical practice to bring patient's red blood count into normal levels, such as in patients suffering from anaemia. A recent report by the US anti-doping agency alleges that Armstrong and his team were able to avoid detection of EPO use by injecting cyclists with saline just before tests to lower their blood cell count. If the organ is the heart or brain this can potentially result in heart attack or stroke. EPO is normally used to treat anaemia, where its effect on each patient is carefully monitored. Professor Cohen points out that researchers work hard to prevent patients taking drugs that don’t work or have dangerous side-effects. He said: 'So why should the standards be different for the same drugs used in athletes? 'Although doping is forbidden, the pressure to win in sport is so great that some athletes seem to be willing to try any way of getting ahead of their competitors. 'When elite athletes and their coaches discover that there is no evidence of benefit and clear risk of harm, I hope many may reconsider trying to cheat. Silent but deadly: EPO may thickens the blood, adding to the risk of clots (above), leading to heart attack and stroke . 'Education may work where attempts at enforcement have failed.“I believe there is a clear need for high-quality research to investigate the effects of supposedly enhancing drugs in sport. 'If, as is expected, many substances in current use are found to be ineffective it will help keep our athletes safe and improve confidence in sporting results.'","Dutch researchers found no evidence the drug, known as EPO, improves performance .
But did discover it may thicken the blood, increasing the risk of clots, stroke and heart attack .

The girl shares Kate's beauty with a heart-shaped face, . striking blue eyes, and long dark hair . Good looking: William and Kate are an attractive couple and Washington based . artist Joe Mullins has used computer-generated imagery to show how their best features could combine in their child . Mr Mullins studied recent photographs of the couple and used the latest computer technology to predict how the child may look during their formative years. If the couple have a son, the boy is expected to inherit many of William's features. Mullins has included the famous Windsor ears and William's slightly receding hairline. A daughter is predicted to closer resemble Kate, with a high forehead, heart shaped face and long brown hair. The Windsor ears: If the couple have a son, artist Joe Mullins says he will inherit William's features, including his hairline and slightly large ears. But Mr Mullins has also imagined him with Kate's colouring and complexion. The controversial image bears little resemblance to the Prince as a baby (right) There are some similarities between Mr Mullins' mock up of the couple's child as a girl (left) and Kate as a child (right), most markedly the face shape, piercing blue eyes, and rosy cheeks . In the past he has taken the faces of other well known couples and imagined how their children may look, and has carried out magazine work where he 'ages' celebrities such Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. But it seems some people are not so hopeful for the couple's offspring. Popular website Morph Thing creator Charanjeet Kondal has taken William and Kate's more 'unique' features and morphed them into what they would look like combined. And less flattering images are a far departure from the glossy American images released by Mr Mullins  - showing a child with thinner hair and slightly protruding ears. While they are not as polished as those produced by the US artist, they do still bear a striking resemblance to the couple as children. Less flattering: The British take on the couple's child uses some of their more unique features, but still has porcelain skin and deep blue eyes. This interpretation appears to bear more of a resemblance to William . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had been hoping to keep the news they were expecting a baby to themselves until Christmas Day. But after Kate was admitted to hospital with extreme morning sickness, sparked by a rare condition called Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), they had little choice but to make the announcement. Kate, 30, who is thought to be between six and eight weeks pregnant, was taken to the hospital just after lunch on Sunday by her husband and put on a drip to stop her becoming dehydrated. But the news delighted millions around the world – including their own families. Sources say she appeared to be responding well to treatment and there was ‘no cause for alarm’. However, doctors at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London have taken the precautionary step of keeping her in for the next few days. Joe Mullins is a highly respected forensic artist based in Washington.

His work has helped trace countless missing children over the 11 years he has worked in forensics. But when he is not hard at work in . the serious day job, he enjoys creating 'fun but scientific forecasts' forecasting how celebrities will look when they are older and how their children might look. Mr Mullins said he took recent . pictures of the Duke and Duchess, and took account of their colouring, and . predominant genes and outstanding features, such as Kate's olive skin, William's ears, and their clear complexions. While he tries to make then as 'cute as possible' he says it is all highly scientific. He said the future king or queen of . England was bound to be 'adorable' and added: 'For Kate and William's . baby - I think there is a lot of good genes in the mix there. 'There is a science behind the . process. The darker features are more dominant with Kate's olive skin . and dark hair.  I would say you are not going to get a fair skinned baby . with blonde hair and blue eyes  - like Diana.' He added: 'Over the years I have done lots of different celebrities. 'I did Jennifer Anniston and Brad Pitt when they were married and I have done a few of Angelina Jolie.

A wife went into labour at her husband's hospital bedside nine weeks early after the shock of finding out he had suffered a horrific car crash. Adam Hambly, 32, was left fighting for his life after suffering multiple injuries in the head-on smash in November. Wife Jo, 35, rushed to be by his side and waited anxiously for signs of recovery. But she was admitted as a patient herself to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, when she started suffering contractions two months before she was due. Adam Hambly and wife Jo in hospital together after the birth of their baby Grace, more than two months early. The couple believe the early labour was triggered by the shock of Mr Hambly's major accident . Jo and Adam - and baby Grace - are all now recovering in neighbouring wards at the Plymouth hospital . After four days of complications, she gave birth to daughter Grace - their first child - by emergency caesarean section and was immediately taken to recover on a ward with her husband lying beside her. Now all three of the family are recovering in neighboring wards and face a Christmas in hospital. But the couple still insist they are 'the luckiest people in the world.' Mr Hambly, a fisherman, said: 'The last two weeks have been the lowest and highest points of my life. I’m just so happy to be here at all.' 'The nurses rushed me into the lift and got me to the maternity ward. A couple of Naval nurses got me down there like a bat out of hell. 'I was in the delivery room on one bed and Jo was on the bed next to me. It was amazing what they did for us - it’s never happened before, apparently. 'We’re convinced it was the stress of the crash that brought on the contractions. 'As soon as the baby arrived I just forgot about everything. She’s amazing. We couldn’t have asked for a healthier baby. She’s just beautiful.' Mr Hambly nearly lost his life when his silver Subaru Impreza was involved in a head-on smash in Plymouth, Devon, on November 17. He had dropped off a workmate when his car was hit by a black Ford Focus. Little Grace was two months premature and was whisked straight to an incubator after she was delivered by emergency caesarean section . The two men in that vehicle escaped unhurt but Mr Hambly's passenger suffered a chest injury and fractured sternum. Rescuers then spent two hours carefully freeing Mr Hambly, of Plymouth, from the wreckage of his car. He said: 'The roof was one inch clear of my head. The police said if I was in a different car I would’ve died.' He shattered his right leg, ripped muscles in his neck, fractured his hip and damaged his finger. He was rushed to Derriford Hospital and underwent the first of four emergency operations. Surgeons fitted metal pins to re-attach 20 pieces of bone, stitching his leg back together with dozens of thick staples. The couple now face Christmas in hospital while little Grace, mother Jo and father Adam recover . Mrs Hambly said when she received a phone call from the scene of the crash telling her that her husband was trapped in she had feared the worst. After racing to the hospital she watched helplessly as her husband recovered from the serious surgery in intensive care. Then six days later, in what experts believe was delayed shock, she began to have contractions despite not being due to give birth until January 24. She was then officially admitted to the hospital where her bed-bound husband had asked hospital staff to be on 24-hour standby to whisk him to the maternity ward. Four days later, in the early hours of Thursday morning, he was told his baby was on the way and was wheeled down in his bed to the birth. Mr Hambly was not allowed into the operating theatre as doctors performed a Caesarean section on his wife. But within minutes of tiny Grace arriving at 4lbs 60z Jo was wheeled back into the delivery suite where Mr Hambly was waiting. The proud father was allowed to see his daughter briefly before she was whisked off to an incubator. She faces a further four weeks in hospital and is on a drip in intensive care but is perfectly healthy. The whole family are preparing to spend Christmas in hospital as they each recover, and Mr Hambly faces six months of operations and rehabilitation before he will be able to walk again . But last Friday he was able to hold little ‘Gracie’ for the first time after leaving his bed in an adapted wheelchair. He said: 'I was in massive discomfort but when I got down there I didn’t feel the pain. 'She’s just amazing. Her whole hand is as big as my thumb. Every single thing that’s happened to us, it’s the mathematical equation of a miracle, really.' Mrs Hambly, who is in a wheelchair and recovering in hospital herself, said she felt blessed that both her husband and daughter had survived. She said: 'It’s been a pretty horrific few weeks but now we have a baby. 'I’m the luckiest person alive at the moment. I thank my lucky stars every day. It could have been a totally different Christmas.' Devon and Cornwall police appealed for anyone with information about the crash, which happened at 7.30pm on November 17, to call 101.","Adam Hambly, of Plymouth, suffered serious injuries in the head on collision in November .

Hospitals are so 'full to bursting' that staff are struggling to keep patients safe, an influential report has warned. And death rates at 12 NHS hospitals are 'worryingly high'. The Dr Foster Hospital Guide report - produced annually by the NHS watchdog, and part funded by the Government - also warns 'quality should not be sacrificed for cost' or patients could be in danger. Unless there is change there could be a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal -  where up to 1,200 patients died because of poor care, it said. The report, which excluded specialist centres but included 145 hospital trusts, said when hospitals were too busy patient care suffered because systems started 'breaking down' The Dr Foster guide shows how admissions were broken down by patient group across the country . The main findings of the report published today, were: . The guide said when hospitals were too busy patient care suffered because systems started 'breaking down' It said: 'Hospitals are under pressure from the rising numbers of emergency admissions, particularly among frail elderly patients. 'For 48 weeks a year most trusts are more than 90 per cent occupied. High levels of occupancy make it harder to provide a safe, effective service.' Each of the 12 trusts which had high death rates fell short on two of four mortality rate indicators - 'deaths after surgery' and the deaths of patients who were admitted for minor ailments or 'low-risk conditions'. 'These measures are to be used as a warning sign that poor-quality care may be leading to a higher-than-expected mortality. 'With the rising demand for care and falling . revenues, there are concerns that trusts will focus more (or . exclusively) on cost of care rather than quality of care. 'Because of this, there is a fear that there could be another Mid Staffs. Hospital managers must ensure that they do not sacrifice one for the other.' The Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust is at the centre of an £11million inquiry. As many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at the trust between 2005 and 2009 due to poor care and medical errors. Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust . Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust . Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust . George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust . Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust . Medway NHS Foundation Trust . North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust . Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust . United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust . University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust . Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust . Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust . The report comes as the government drives forward an 'efficiency' plan which will see £20bn slashed from the NHS budget. Katherine Murphy, Chief Executive of The Patients Association, said: 'These distressing figures reveal bed occupancy rates are at the very limit of what is safe or indeed desirable for patients. 'Our Helpline hears day in day out from patients and relatives who are experiencing unacceptably poor care, with nursing staff telling relatives that they simply not having time to deliver the fundamentals of good care or dignity. 'The Government must consider the devastating impact its £20 billion efficiency drive is having  on the number of hospital beds, at a time when we have an aging population and rising admissions. 'Moving forward care, particularly for the elderly, must be better integrated so that when appropriate it can take place in home and community settings.' But University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) - one of the 12 trusts named as having higher death rates in the two categories - raised concerns about the validity of the Dr Foster indicators. The Dr Foster reports rank mortality - or deaths -  with a measurement called the Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio (HSMR). It measures if the death rate at a hospital is higher or lower than expected using a series of indicators. Dr Dave Rosser, medical director at the trust, said: 'The HSMR (Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio) is widely considered to be unsuitable for use as a comparative indicator between hospitals. 'Dr Foster frequently changes the methodology of the HSMR which, in our opinion, further reduces its credibility as a comparator.' He said: 'In our opinion, the mortality indicator relating to conditions of low clinical risk is deeply flawed. 'To illustrate, one of the patients identified by Dr Foster to be in this category was a patient admitted into one of UHB’s specialist services with a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis, which is known to have a mortality in excess of 50 per cent. 'Under Dr Foster’s methodology, this condition is classified as an allergy and therefore treated as ‘low clinical risk’. There are many similar examples.' The report also found that death rates at three of the 12 hospitals have been consistently high for three years running. Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust and George Eliot Hospital Trust in Nuneaton had high death rates three years in a row. Authors of the Dr Foster report had alerted authorities to problems at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust - where the deaths rates were also high for a number of years. The Dr Foster report has warned death rates at a dozen trusts are alarmingly high. It has warned 'quality must be put over cost or there will be another Mid Staffs situation', where 1200 patients died due to a lack of care . Kevin McGee, chief executive at George Eliot, said the trust commissioned an external review of its historically high mortality rates last year and acknowledged the figures had been 'unacceptably high.' He added: 'We are obviously pleased with the improvements in mortality rates seen so far this year and it is testament to the efforts of all our staff, but we are still some distance from where we want to be.' A spokesman for the Dudley Group said it took mortality indicators very seriously and recent reports had suggested 'a significant and sustained improvement.' But the Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust strongly denied that it had a higher than expected mortality rate and questioned whether the hospital guide reflected new ways of operating. Medical Director Graz Luzzi said: 'The title says it all. This is a hospital guide, but our care is also delivered at home, in the community and in a hospice. To be effective it is important to compare like with like.' Dr Foster Intelligence's Director of Research, Roger Taylor, said: 'Given the current pressures on NHS budgets, it is no longer enough to just provide good quality care. 'Of course the best possible patient outcomes will always be of paramount importance. We have shown that there are a small number of trusts that are able to deliver high quality care in an efficient way which other hospitals should learn from.'","Dr Foster, the NHS watchdog, found 12 trusts have 'worryingly high' death rates .

They played a key role when the young couple walked down the aisle. And now Prince Harry and Kate's sister, socialite Pippa Middleton, are favourite to become godparents to their child. It is no secret the siblings are two of the most important people in the young couple's life and if the royal tradition of appointing the best man and maid of . honour from their wedding is observed they will definitely be offered the roles. New role: Prince Harry and Kate's sister Pippa are favourites to become godparents to the new royal baby . Happily married: Only 20 months after the couple were married they are now expecting a baby. The baby will become monarch, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl . Joe Little, Managing Editor of the Majesty royal magazine, said his money would be on the siblings: 'I think Harry and Pippa are very likely. 'As you know most people have just one or two godparents. But in royal circles you have a lot more, certainly William had quite a team. 'I rather think they won't have quite so many - perhaps four. Harry would take care of the royal connection and Pippa would take care of the Middleton side. 'There are few options amongst their close friends. The van Cutsems and the van Straubenzees certainly.' Thomas van Straubenzee has been one of the Prince's closest friends since they first met at Ludgrove Prep School. Tom, also known as 'Van', accompanied the Prince on his first official tour to New Zealand and William and Prince Harry are patrons of a memorial fund dedicated to his brother Henry, who was killed in a car crash in 2002. Possibility? The van Cutsems are among those also hotly tipped to become godparents. Grace van Cutsem, pictured, is Prince William's god daughter. She stole the show at the Royal Wedding when she grumpily covered her ears during a noisy flypast . Edward, Hugh, Nicholas and William van Cutsem are close family friends from Norfolk who have known the Prince since childhood. Three-year-old Grace van Cutsem - who almost stole the show at the Royal Wedding when she was pictured clapping her hands over her ears during a noisy RAF fly past - is William’s god-daughter and the son of Rose Astor and Hugh Van Cutsem, a friend of William and Harry. Mr Little added: 'William is a godfather of several children, one of whom was Grace van Custem, the little bridesmaid covering her ears on the balcony on their wedding day. 'Quite possibly the favour will be returned to them. 'I would say Harry and Pippa, a Van Cutsem, and maybe one of Kate's close chums from school and that might be it. 'In . the past there have been a shed load more godparents, both royal and . non royal, but I don't think they will want do things on such a grand . scale. That was then and this is now. 'Whoever . it is it would have been given careful consideration. It would be a . huge honour to be the godparent of a future King or Queen.' Bookmakers are already offering odds on who will take on the important role with Pippa and Harry being odds on favourites. The couple's . first child will push Prince Harry into fourth place in the line of . succession to the throne - even if they have a girl. Prince William and Kate's child would move into third place, become more important than Harry and not be subject to the centuries-old law of primogeniture, which puts male heirs ahead of women. He or she will leapfrog Harry by being be the first born of first-in-line Prince Charles's first son. So close: The Duchess of Cambridge, (centre), Prince William (right) and Prince Harry (left) wave as they pass the Houses of Parliament during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in June . The baby will be third in line to the throne regardless of gender after Prime Minister David Cameron agreed a deal with other Commonwealth countries to change the rules on  the royal line of succession which means male heirs will no longer be given priority. This means that in the 15 other countries where the Queen is head of state the rules must be changed. It had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the Royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed. But the announcement that the . Duchess of Cambridge is expecting the couple's first child - third in line to the throne - has come after the deal was agreed. In . October 2011, David Cameron announced that the 16 Commonwealth . countries where the Queen is head of state had agreed to give female . royals the same rights of succession as their brothers. 'Put . simply, if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were to have a little . girl, that girl would one day be our queen,” Mr Cameron said. The changes mean that, for all descendants of the Prince of Wales, younger sons will no longer take precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession. Members of the Royal Family who marry a Roman Catholic will also in future be able to succeed to the Crown. And an ancient and unused rule saying . descendants of George II are supposed to gain the consent of the . monarch to marry will only apply to the first six people in the line of . succession. The law was brought in following the . Glorious Revolution – when a Dutch invasion helped overthrow a Papist . king – so that a Catholic could never sit on our throne again. It . also means that the Princess Royal, the Queen’s second born, is just . tenth in line to the throne behind her younger brothers Andrew (fourth) and Edward (seventh). The 15 other countries where Elizabeth II is queen are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Soloman Islands, Tuvalu, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and St Kitts and Nevis. The Commonwealth leaders also agreed . to overturn the 1701 Act of Settlement, which means that only the . Protestant heirs of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of . James I, can become king or queen. The . Queen hailed the deal on changing the rules as the 53 Commonwealth . countries met last year, saying she wanted the theme of allowing women . to play a full part to last for years. She said: 'The theme this year is Women As Agents of Change. 'It . reminds us of the potential in our societies that is yet to be fully . unlocked and it encourages us to find ways to allow all girls and women . to play their full part. 'We . must continue to strive in our own countries and across the . Commonwealth together to promote that theme in a lasting way beyond this . year.' Her comments were taken as a sign that the Queen approves of the reform.","The pair, who took lead roles at the wedding, are odds on to be named godparents .

Worldwide support flooded in for Caden Beggan after his parents shared his battle against meningitis on Facebook. He has since died and his schoolfriend have stormed into the download charts with a single in his honour . Caden's classmates at Ladywell Primary School, Motherwell, have peaked at number nine inthe iTuens charts with their rendition of O Holy Night. They want to raise money for meningitis research in his name . Now school friends of the little boy, described by his family as a 'warrior', have released their rendition of the classic carol Oh Holy Night to benefit the Meningitis Research Fund in his name. The single by Ladywell Primary School, sold quickly after its release on November 21 and broke into the top twenty downloads on the iTunes chart soon after, peaking at number nine. The track, which costs 79p, has so far been downloaded almost 10,000 times, raising £3,680 for charity and £409 for the school. Pat Ashworth, the school’s head teacher, said they had only hoped to sell a few hundred downloads to parents and family and never expected it to go so high into the charts in such a short time. Mrs Ashworth told the Wishaw Press: 'It’s absolutely incredible and is due to the tremendous public support shown to Caden’s family through Facebook and in the media.' After recording the song as part of a Christmas CD, the forward thinking year two pupils suggested the track be uploaded onto iTunes. Another song recorded by the school children for the CD, If I Were a Butterfly, was one of Caden’s favourites and was played at his funeral. The choir at Ladywell Primary School have rocketed into the top 10 on the iTunes download chart after releasing the song in tribute to their much missed friend . The majority of the funds raised from sales of Oh Holy Night will go towards researching meningococcal septicaemia, and the remaining 10 per cent will go towards helping school funds. Caden died at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow on November 20, after a four week struggle against which saw him undergo several operations and have both legs and his left hand removed in a bid to increase his chances of survival. Messages of support and prayers were sent from people around the world after his parents, David and Angela, set up the Facebook page, to keep friends and family up-to-date on his condition. It attracted more than 30,000 followers from well-wishers - the majority of them strangers - eager to know how he was getting on. The sparky little boy was obsessed with pirates and mourners at his funeral heard how he loved to sing and draw pictures, of cowboys, his beloved dinosaurs, and, of course, pirates.","A rendition of Oh Holy Night by Ladywell Primary School was recorded in honour of classmate Caden Beggan .

A month after the bitterly fought election, President Barack Obama has his highest approval ratings since the killing of Osama bin Laden, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll, and more Americans say the nation is heading in the right direction now than at any time since the start of his first term. Obama's approval rating stands at 57 percent, the highest since May 2011, when U.S. Navy SEALs killed the terror leader, and up 5 percentage points from before the election. And 42 percent say the country is on the right track, up from 35 percent in January 2009. Pointing the way: More Americans say the nation is heading in the right direction now than at any time since the start of President Obama's first term . A majority think it's likely that the president will be able to improve the economy in his second term. 'Compared to the alternative, I'm more optimistic about government and the economy with him in office,' said Jack Reinholt, an independent from Bristol, R.I., who backed Obama in 2008 and again in 2012. 'I feel he has the better path laid out.' Still, four years of partisan conflict in Washington have taken a toll on the president's image. 'I'm less enthusiastic about him than the first time he was elected,' Reinholt added. Phew: Obama's ratings are the highest they have been since the killing of Osama bin Laden . Americans are divided on what kind of president Obama has been, with 37 percent saying he's been above average or outstanding and 36 percent describing his tenure as below average or poor. Another quarter say he's been just average. Obama held much stronger numbers on this measure at the start of his first term, with two-thirds expecting an above-average presidency. And the public's take on Obama's relative performance has bounced back and forth over his four years in office, moving higher following the death of bin Laden, after declining in the summer of 2010, a few months before the GOP took back control of the House. Looking ahead to Obama's final four years, most Americans doubt he can reduce the federal budget deficit. President Obama speaks at a manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania at the end of November. A majority of Americans think it's likely that the president will be able to improve the economy in his second term . But almost 7 in 10 say he will be able to implement the health care law passed in March 2010 and remove most troops from Afghanistan. And most think he'll be able to improve the economy and boost race relations in his final term, though both those figures are down significantly from January 2009. About a quarter say the economy is in good shape in the new poll, similar to pre-election poll results, but optimism about the economy has dipped since before the election. In October, 52 percent of Americans said they expected the economy to get better in the next year; now, that stands at 40 percent. Among Republicans, the share saying the economy will improve in the coming year has dropped sharply since before the election, from 42 percent in October to 16 percent now. On the up: The President's approval rating stands at 57 percent, the highest since May 2011, when U.S. Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden . Americans are divided on what kind of president Obama has been, with 37 percent saying he's been above average or outstanding and 36 percent describing his tenure as below average or poor . 'The economy, if left alone, will gradually improve because of our people wanting to better themselves and make more money,' said Bobby Jordan, 76, a Romney voter from Green Valley, Ariz. 'They're going to be doing things to improve their own position, which will collectively mean the economy will gradually get a little better. But (Obama's) not doing anything to improve the economy.' Overall, the public gives Democrats the advantage on handling the economy, 45 percent saying they trust the president's party to do a better job on it, 39 percent favoring Republicans. As Obama took office four years ago, Republicans were mostly optimistic about his chances for improving the economy, with nearly 7 in 10 saying it was likely the new president could improve it in his first four years in office. The president, with first lady Michelle Obama, has seen his approval ratings rise since the November elections . Now, just 21 percent of Republicans feel the next four years are that promising. Independents, too, have grown skeptical about Obama's ability to turn around the economy. About three-quarters thought he could fix it in 2009; just a third do now. Those sharp partisan divides in expectations are represented in the president's approval ratings. About 9 in 10 Democrats say they approve of the way Obama is handling his job, compared with just 2 in 10 Republicans. That gap approaches the 82-point partisan gap in George W. Bush's approval ratings according to Gallup polling in December 2004. The Associated Press-GfK Poll was conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 3 by GfK Roper Public Affairs and Corporate Communications. It involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,002 adults nationwide. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups. Most Americans doubt that Obama can reduce the federal budget deficit. But almost 7 in 10 say he will be able to implement the health care law passed in March 2010 .","More Americans say the nation is heading in the right direction now than at any time since the start of Obama's first term .

As he stood on the church steps dozens of balloons - each marked with the children's ages - were released to the sky. Members of the media were not allowed within the services. However in a statement made before the funeral Desautels,  expressed the terrible agony of his loss. 'I’d like to thank everyone who have banded together to help us — . myself and my family — in this terrible ordeal,' Desautels said in a prepared statement. 'The pain we are experiencing is . inexplicable.' He asked that media respect the privacy of his family, and said he would deeply miss his beloved children for the rest of his life.

A BBC documentary will claim a mystery man was living in the house where Lord Lucan's nanny was murdered. The man may have been the boyfriend of one of the women in the property at the time nanny Sandra Rivett was battered to death there in 1974. The programme, due to be screened tomorrow night on Inside Out South East, claims that researchers have found a witness statement which they say was not shown at Miss Rivett's inquest. It was made by the aristocrat's sister-in-law Lady Sarah Gibbs, who said she had spoken to the earl's daughter Camilla, then aged four. The child told her about a man living at the house in Westminster, London, which her mother Veronica shared with her brother George and sister Frances. She suggested he could have been a boyfriend of her mother - then separated from Lucan  - but Lady Sarah is believed to have said he was more likely to have been in a relationship with Miss Rivett. The documentary also reportedly found two police reports that Lucan was alive in 2002. But the family have rejected all the claims. George Bingham, seven at the time of the killing, told the Sunday Mirror: 'If there is new evidence that is credible and from serving officers all well and good, but I very much doubt there is. 'We have been very clear with the BBC that we do not agree with what they are saving and we do not believe their claims.' Battered: nanny Sandra Rivett whose body was found in Lucan's basement and his wife Lady Veronica Lucan . It was the first time they had been told of an alleged conversation between Camilla and Lady Sarah, according to the family. Conversation: Lucan sister-in-law Lady Sarah Gibbs talked to his young daughter Camilla . Last February the Inside Out programme spoke to two witnesses who alleged the disgraced peer was smuggled out of the UK to a secret life abroad. 'Jill' worked for Lucan's friend John Aspinall, a zoo owner and gambling club host, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She claimed Mr Aspinall, Sir James Goldsmith and others held secret meetings at which she was present where they discussed getting the peer's children out to see him in Africa using second passports. The allegations were rejected by Mr Bingham, now 45. He told the Mirror: 'So much has been written and said about my family and their links to Africa. 'There is absolutely no way my father went there. If he was going to flee he wouldn’t have gone to Africa.' The killing of 29-year-old Miss Rivett on the evening of 7 November 1974, sparked Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. Her body was found hidden in an old U.S. mail sack in the basement of the home at 46 Lower Belgrave Street, Westminster. Lady . Lucan was also attacked and later identified Lucan as her assailant.

The referee waved the fight to an end as Marquez celebrated and the sold-out crowd at the MGM erupted. Pacquiao was down for about two minutes before his handlers managed to get him up. While Pacquiao will hope that he left nothing in the locker room despite his defeat it emerged that Romney had $25.7 million left in the bank days after the November 6th election.

Police are investigating claims against 25 celebrities of alleged sex offences in connection with the Jimmy Savile inquiry. At least six of the high-profile figures are expected to be arrested this month and in the new year. The 25, reportedly mostly television and radio entertainers, are named in a list of tip-offs to Operation Yewtree -  the police inquiry set up after late Top Of The Pops presenter Savile was exposed as a serial abuser. Police are investigating claims against 25 celebrities of alleged sex offences, it has been reported. Scotland Yard has said it is dealing with about 450 potential victims . A source with knowledge of the inquiry told the Sunday Times: 'They all tend to be white men of the Savile generation'. In some cases victims will not be identified or press charges. But in at least a dozen cases, police are reported to believe there is enough evidence for the celebrities to be detained. 'Damaging and totally untrue': Max Clifford speaks outside Belgravia police station in central London last Thursday evening . The source added: 'We are halfway through'. There . are three strands to the Yewtree operation – two involving Savile, and a . third termed ‘others’. The first strand, involving Savile, relates to allegations against Savile himself and the second, another category of sex offence where Savile committed the alleged crimes with other people. The third strand relates to a separate individual unconnected to Savile. Five arrests have so far been made under the strand termed 'others', which means they were not questioned about anything connected to Savile. PR guru Max Clifford was the fifth suspect to be arrested - and sixth person to be questioned - last week. His arrest followed the questioning of one man in his 80s and from Berkshire, who was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences.

A woman was forced to have a mastectomy after a private clinic took nearly a year to pass on the results of a crucial scan that revealed she was suffering from breast cancer. The X-ray showed Judith Dawson had a potentially cancerous tumour in her left breast but by the time she received the results from Medicentre 11 months later, it had grown into an aggressive 2in lump. The grandmother, 64, then endured months of gruelling chemotherapy and surgery which experts say could have been prevented. However, she is unable to bring a legal claim against Medicentre for the appalling blunder after the chain went into administration last year. Ordeal: Victim Judith Dawson had an X-ray on a potentially cancerous tumour in her left breast but by the time she received the results from Medicentre 11 months later, it had grown into an aggressive 2in lump . The firm, subsequently bought by another organisation, has also failed to apologise for the error. Social worker Mrs Dawson, from Reading, said: ‘I was flabbergasted to receive an envelope in the post after 11 months. It said I needed a follow-up and originally I thought, “Well, a follow-up is fine.” ‘It wasn’t until I took it to my GP, who said the time-lapse was appalling, that I realised something was wrong. Within ten days I had seen a consultant and had a  tissue biopsy. ‘The tumour was too large by then to save my breast. I felt horribly let down. Doctors say the mastectomy wouldn’t have been necessary if someone had seen the X-ray results a year earlier. I can’t get anyone to admit they did anything wrong.’ 11 months too late: Mrs Dawson was forced to have a mastectomy after a private clinic took too long to pass on the results of a crucial scan (stock picture) that revealed she was suffering from breast cancer . The mother of four had regular health . assessments with Medicentre because her employers, Wandsworth Council in . South London, had a contract with the company. In May 2009, she went . for an annual check-up at its site in Waterloo and was referred to a . respected Harley Street clinic for a routine mammogram because of her . age. It is understood the clinic sent the results on the same day by courier to Medicentre’s main office, with a recommendation that a further investigation be carried out immediately. No action taken: After a routine mammogram, the results were sent to Medicentre's main office, with a recommendation for immediate investigation . However, no action was taken. Mrs Dawson . contacted Medicentre in July 2009 to ask about the results but nothing . was passed on, which she assumed was a good sign. It was only after Medicentre rang her . in April 2010 to make an appointment for another health check that the . X-ray was posted to her home with a recommendation that it be ‘followed . up’. Medicentre, which went into administration  in 2011, was later . taken over by General Medical Clinics, but it still operates clinics . under the Medicentre name. Medicentre’s insurers, which would have been responsible for making a payout, deemed Medicentre’s policy invalid as one doctor working at the group was found not to have personal liability insurance.

Fruit, vegetables, oily fish, grains, eggs, nuts and poultry all come to mind as examples of a ‘healthy diet’. Yet new European rules this month will turn all that on its head. The Nutrition and Health Claims regulations were brought in to ban misleading or unproven claims on food and drink products, such as weight-loss promises or claims about mental function or heart health. In their place will be a list of health claims authorised by the European Commission. Ripe rules: The new EU rules do not favour broccoli, instead recommending Ribena . It means that websites, labels and even brand names will be affected. Gone will be Slimfast, for instance, as there is not enough scientific proof that it helps people slim. Consumer groups have welcomed the demise of unregulated health claims, but dieticians are unimpressed. Why? Because many of the foods on the newly approved list are processed ingredients, while many foods that cannot make health claims are obviously good for us, such as tomato juice, honey, pumpkin seeds and broccoli. So if you’re starting a health kick, what should you be eating according to the European Commission and its expert panel? Better than broccoli: Ribena . ‘HEART HEALTHY’ IN . Plant stanol esters or plant sterols are the active ingredient in some . products that claim to reduce cholesterol. You need 3g daily to reduce . the bad LDL cholesterol by ten per cent but you can get this from only . two UK brands, Benecol  and Flora Proactive, as the ingredients are . patented. Products containing Omega-3  fats can also make this claim. OUT . Soya. Despite several clinical trials showing that soya foods can . maintain healthy blood cholesterol levels, the claim was rejected . because the scientific panel didn’t know if the effect came from the . soya protein or other natural substances in the soya. MY VIEW . It’s still worth eating soya foods for heart health because it doesn’t . matter if we can’t nail down the detail, it does have an effect. Oats, . also good for us, did get a positive opinion from the EC for heart . health. ‘MAINTAINS NORMAL BOWEL FUNCTION’ IN . Lactulose, that sugary substance prescribed for old people and toddlers . – a large tablespoon will get you going. Activated charcoal was also . highlighted as a cure for flatulence. OUT Probiotics. There were many positive studies but the panel was unclear which . strains are best. Prunes were almost banned, but when an MEP challenged . the European Commissioner to a prune-eating contest, he relented and put . them on the approved list. MY VIEW Go for the natural solution of prunes. No yog: The commission could not agree on which strain of probiotics. which can be found in yoghurt, was best, so put none on the approved list . ‘KEEPS YOU FULLER LONGER’ IN Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose fibre. Never heard of it? Me neither. But now, because it can claim to keep blood sugar levels stable, it will probably become a common additive to lots of foods. OUT Saying something is ‘low GI’ and will keep blood sugar stable, because there are so many low GI foods that EU experts dismissed this area. Also out are high-protein foods that claim to keep you fuller for longer, as the panel thought the studies were too short and didn’t account for other nutrients. Calorie-controlled diets were not even assessed for a claim. MY VIEW The evidence for low-GI foods, such as oats, pasta, wholegrain rice and pulses, is good, with no side effects. High tea: The new laws rule in favour of energy drinks over tea in the battle of the caffeinated beverages . ‘ENERGY BOOSTING’ IN Magnesium . and B vitamins, such as riboflavin, B6 and niacin. These are now being . added to energy drinks – usually alongside stimulants such as caffeine. Only 15 per cent of the Recommended Daily Allowance is needed per 100g . for manufacturers to make a claim. OUT . Tea. Despite good evidence that small amounts of caffeine, such as . those found in tea, perk you up, a claim (plus a health warning) was . given only to high-dose caffeine products. MY VIEW Tea is a healthier source of caffeine than energy drinks, as it’s naturally sugar-free and released at a slower rate. ‘MAINTAINS IMMUNITY’ IN Vitamins A and C which means that Ribena, a syrup containing five per cent fruit, can make an immune claim due to its added vitamins. OUT Broccoli, as most of the studies weren’t controlled enough and the panel thought there was too much variation in broccoli species. Manuka honey was also rejected because the composition varies depending on the source. MY VIEW Stick to the natural stuff. Carrots and spinach are rich in Vitamin A, while kiwi, oranges and kale provide enough Vitamin D.

An expensive tea set that no one has ever dared to use has sold for a record price of more than £500,000. The service’s decoration has been hailed as the 'very, very best' Meissen porcelain a collector could hope to get. The ‘Half-Figure Service’, made in around 1723, sparked a bidding frenzy at the Bonhams sale in central London. Careful: A beaker and saucer from the world's most valuable tea set, which fetched a record £541,250 at a Bonhams auction in central London . Delicate: An intricate Oriental-style painting of a man leading a horse on one of the service's saucers . It was eventually snapped up by an overseas buyer for a staggering £541,250, believed to be a world record for a tea service. The set consists of a hexagonal tea canister and cover, tiny tea bowls, beakers and saucers, a milk jug and sugar bowl - but is missing its teapot. It takes its name from the intricate Oriental-style decoration by Johann Gregorius Hvroldt - the most famous painter at the porcelain factory in Meissen near Dresden - and features half-length figures engaged in various pursuits. His beautifully-painted scenes include a man leading a camel and another with his horse. Intricate: Another very expensive porcelain saucer shows a man leading a camel . Ornate: A lavishly-finished Meissen Hausmalar eagle teapot and cover, . made in around 1715, sold for £31,250 . The tea set was the star lot in Egyptian-born seller Said Marouf’s 'incredible' Meissen collection that raised more £1 million in total at the sale. Many of his porcelain pieces have been exhibited in museums worldwide. Bonhams’ European porcelain specialist Nette Megens said the set is so valuable that it has probably never actually been used to take tea by its original high society owner or since. She said: 'The rarity and quality of this tea set makes it the very, very best Meissen porcelain a collector could hope to get. 'The set is made from the most subtle porcelain possible. It is very thin and translucent. Left, a rare Meissen chocolate cup and saucer made in around 1739 sold for £55,250 at the Bonhams auction in central London, and right, an intricate painting on one of the beakers in the tea service that sold for £541,250 . 'Johann Gregorius Hvroldt is the most famous painter from the Meissen factory and his chinoiserie scenes are imaginative and beautiful. 'Individual pieces of his work rarely come to market and never has a tea service of this calibre come to market before. 'This service was not even made to be used. It was made to be displayed on brackets on the wall to show off its quality.' A rare Meissen chocolate cup and saucer, made in around 1739, went for £55,250 at the auction. And a lavishly finished Meissen Hausmalar eagle teapot and cover, made in around 1715, went for £31,250. The Meissen collection being sold by Mr Marouf and his wife Roswitha is one of the world’s biggest and most highly regarded. Expensive: The 'Half-Figure Service', made in around 1723, consists of a hexagonal tea canister and cover, tiny tea bowls, beakers and saucers, a milk jug and sugar bowl, but is missing its original teapot . Expert: Ceramics specialist Nette Megens with the the rare Meissen Hausmalar eagle teapot and cover . Sebastian Kuhn, Bonhams’ director of European porcelain, said: 'The Said and Roswitha Marouf Collection is without doubt one of the most important collections of 18th century Meissen porcelain to come to the market. 'It is incredible to see such a selection of fine pieces, including some rare and intimate items from the royal toilette, with fascinating provenance. 'Said Marouf has been an avid collector all his life and started out collecting pocket and wrist watches. 'It is not hard to see why his eye for detail attracted him to the extremely detailed and intricate decoration of early 18th century Meissen porcelain.' Production of porcelain at Meissen started in 1710. It was the dominant style of European porcelain among royals and nobility until around 1756. The techniques used in the manufacture of pieces were meant to be kept utterly secret, although there were betrayals. According to Meissen's website, the arcanist Samuel Stöltzel attempted to use his knowledge to set up a rival to the company in Vienna in 1718. This attempted faking exercise rendered a system of 'marking' necessary to prove the authenticity of any given piece. Several means of identifying porcelain were devised in the next few years, although it was not until 1920 that an underglaze cobalt blue was perfected by Meissen. This ensured a forgery-proof system of marking was found. Johann Melchior Steinbrück, first inspector at the manufactory, proposed using a motif from the Electoral Saxon coat-of-arms as the official symbol of the company, in keeping with the monogram of the then Elector Prince of Saxony and King of Poland, . Augustus the Strong. The ensuing adoption of the 'crossed swords' gave rise to its renowned mark, which was formally adopted by Meissen in about 1731. The 'crossed swords' are still painted on by hand today.","Rare tea service hailed 'the best' in Meissen porcelain sold for record price .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced Saturday night that his cancer has returned and that he will undergo another bout of surgery in Cuba. Chavez, who won re-election on October 7th, also said for the first time that if his health were to worsen, his successor would be Vice President Nicolas Maduro. 'We should guarantee the advance of the Bolivarian Revolution,' Chavez said on television, seated at the presidential palace with Maduro and other aides. Scroll down for video . Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, (left), speaks with his Defense Minister Diego Molero upon his arrival to Simon Bolivar airport in Maiquetia, near Caracas today . The president said that tests had shown a return of 'some malignant cells' in the same area where tumors were previously removed. He said he would return to Cuba on Sunday to undergo surgery in the coming days. Chavez called it a 'new battle.' It is to be his third operation to remove cancerous tissue in about a year and a half. The 58-year-old president first underwent cancer surgery for an unspecified type of pelvic cancer in Cuba in June 2011, after an operation for a pelvic abscess earlier in the month found the cancer. He had another cancer surgery last February after a tumor appeared in the same area. He has also undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Hugo Chavez, (left), speaks to Cuba's President Raul Castro, (center), before the South American leader departed Cuba for Venezuela on Friday . Chavez made his most recent trip to Cuba on the night of November 27th, saying he would receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Such treatment is regularly used to help heal tissues damaged by radiation treatment. Chavez said that he has been coping with pain and that while he was in Cuba thorough exams detected the recurrence of cancer. He arrived back in Caracas on Friday after 10 days of medical treatment in Cuba, but until Saturday night had not referred to his health. His unexplained decision to skip a summit of regional leaders in Brazil on Friday had raised suspicions among many Venezuelans that his health had taken a turn for the worse. Chavez said that he was requesting permission from lawmakers to travel to Havana and that he hoped to have good news after the surgery. This news comes just two months after Chavez drafted tanks and soldiers wielding AK-47s onto the streets of Caracas as he won a historic third re-election after almost 14 years in office. Victory lap: Hugo Chavez waves a Venezuelan flag while speaking to supporters after receiving news of his reelection in Caracas . Celebration: A Chavez supporter revels in the streets after the vote in October . The decision marked the end of a bitter campaign in which the opposition . accused him of unfairly using Venezuela's oil wealth and his near total . control of state institutions to his advantage. Chavez rallied thousands of supporters from a balcony of the presidential palace as he declared victory, holding up a sword that once belonged to 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar. 'The revolution has triumphed!' Chavez told the crowd, saying his supporters 'voted for socialism.' The crowd responded chanting 'Chavez won't go!' The election triumph gave Chavez a freer hand to push for an even bigger state role in the economy and continue populist programs. Six more years: The win gives Chavez another term to cement his legacy and press more forcefully for a transition to socialism in the country with the world's largest proven oil reserve . Jumping for joy: Supporters of Hugo Chavez celebrate in the streets as the longtime president won re-election . He pledged before the vote to make a . stronger push for socialism in the next term. He's also likely to . further limit dissent and deepen friendships with U.S. rivals. A victory for his opponent Henrique Capriles would have brought . a radical foreign policy shift including a halt to preferential oil . deals with allies such as Cuba, along with a loosening of state economic . controls and an increase in private investment. Good feeling: Chavez gestures to supporters after casting his vote during the election in Caracas . During the election Chavez's critics said the president has inflamed divisions by labeling his opponents 'fascists,' 'Yankees' and 'neo-Nazis,' while Chavez backers alleged Capriles would halt generous government programs that assist the poor. The news of the return of his cancer is a big blow for his supporters in South America's biggest oil exporter, who elected him in October to a new six-year term in power. Chavez has twice said he was cured, and then had to return to Cuba for more surgery. In a televised broadcast flanked by ministers at the Miraflores presidential palace, Chavez said that if anything happened to him and a new vote had to be held, his supporters should vote for Vice President Nicolas Maduro - the first time the socialist leader has named a successor. Chavez returned to Venezuela on Friday from having medical treatment in Cuba, ending a three-week absence from public view. 'Unfortunately, during these exhaustive exams they found some malignant cells in the same area ... . It is absolutely necessary, absolutely essential, that I have to undergo a new surgical intervention,' the 58-year-old said, looking resolute. 'With God's will, like on the previous occasions, we will come out of this victorious.' The president has already had three cancer operations in Cuba since the middle of last year. News of more surgery will likely raise new doubts about his future and the fate of his self-styled 'revolution' in the OPEC nation. Chavez, who has dominated Venezuelan politics since taking power 14 years ago, said he would return to Havana on Sunday. Under Venezuela's constitution, an election would have to be held within 30 days if Chavez were to leave office within the first four years of his next term, due to begin on January 10. The president has been receiving treatment at the Cimeq hospital in Havana as a guest of his friend and political mentor, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

He noted that 22 per cent of Americans get their news from Fox, telling HuffPost Live that the network has 'divided our country in a way that we haven't been divided probably since the Civil War'. RFK Jr later attended the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest which benefits the charity he is president of and founded, the Waterkeeper Alliance. He was pictured with girlfriend Cheryl Hines as he mingled with celebrities including Neil Patrick Harris, Gavin Rossdale and Larry David.

Sporting: Kerry Kennedy and actress Cheryl Hines attend the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Park City, an event which raises money for charity the Waterkeeper Alliance . Last month, it was widely reported that the family of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s late wife has hired a high-powered investigation firm to look into ‘unanswered questions’ about her death. Mary Richardson’s relatives have asked Washington-based Investigative Group International to see if the suicide on May 16 was actually a ‘wrongful death’. The company - which was hired by Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal -  is said to have assigned a former homicide prosecutor to the case which will also examine Mr Kennedy’s movements in the days before. The explosive development opens the door to the Richardson family bringing an unlawful death lawsuit against Mr Kennedy because they believe he is in part responsible for her demise. The reports suggest Miss Richardson’s family are not convinced by the official account of what happened on the day of her death, which a coroner ruled was suicide by hanging.","Robert F Kennedy Jr attended celebrity ski event in Park City, Utah with girlfriend Cheryl Hines ."

Three million cheering spectators lining the streets of Manhattan were treated to the awkward sight of Elmo the puppet singing together with Big Bird at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The potentially inappropriate decision by the makers of Sesame Street follows directly in the wake of allegations that Kevin Clash, the puppeteer behind the much-loved red Muppet sexually abused up to four young men. Taking their place among stalwarts such as Buzz Lightyear, Sailor Mickey Mouse, the Pillsbury Doughboy, Spider-Man and Kermit the Frog, Elmo and his buddies have long been a fixture in the parade enjoyed by up to 50 million people watching from the warmth of their homes. Despite the controversy, organisers said they hoped the parade will lift the spirits of New Yorkers still recovering from the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, and thousands of those affected were given front-row seats by Macy's.

Meanwhile, beneath blue skies and 50-degree temperatures, the huge balloons were carried along a new route down 6th Avenue by 8,000 trained wranglers. It kicked off at 9am at 77th Street and Central Park West, continued on to Columbus Circle and turned onto Central Park South.

A Stradivarius violin described as the 'Mona Lisa' of the music world has sold for a record £9.8million at  auction to raise money for victims of the  Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The pristine instrument was made by the famed craftsman Antonio Stradivari in 1721 and is one of  the two best preserved among his violins. The 'Lady Blunt' is named after former owner Lady Anne Blunt, granddaughter of the poet Lord Byron. Record sale: The Lady Blunt violin, made by Stradivarius in 1721, fetched nearly £10m following the online auction . Master craftsmanship: Experts said it was rare to find a Stradivarius in such pristine condition . Previous owner: The violin was named after Lady Anne Blunt, the granddaughter of Lord Byron . The density of the wood used is what's thought to give Stradivarius violins their uniquely sweet sound. Tests . were carried out on violins made by Stradivarius and another renowned . Italian violin maker, Guarneri del Gesu, along with eight 'modern' violins. Experts discovered . that variations in wood growth density, determined by tree growth . cycles, were considerably larger in the modern violins. Early . growth wood, produced during spring, is more porous and less dense than . late growth wood which provides more structural support rather than . transporting water. The . early and late growth wood in the modern instruments had noticeable . different densities not present in the older instruments. Experts concluded that wood treatments used by the Italian craftsment may have contributed to the instruments' sound. It was bought by an  anonymous bidder in an  internet auction in London on Monday. It sold for almost £4million more than was paid for it in 2008. Stradivari made violins, violas and cellos in Cremona, Italy. Some 600 are still in existence. The Lady Blunt violin has survived, like the Messiah Stradivarius of 1716, in near-original condition. Jason Price, director of Tarisio, the online auction house that sold the violin, said: 'Fine instruments appreciate in value just like fine works of art. 'The Lady Blunt is the most significant violin that a collector can buy. 'In the world of stringed instruments, it is the equivalent of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa or Michelangelo's David.' The Nippon Music Foundation, which sold the violin, donated the proceeds to victims of the Japanese disaster. Kazuko Shiomi, president of the Foundation, said: 'While this violin was very important to our collection, the needs of our fellow Japanese people ... have proven that we all need to help, in any way we can.'",Proceeds will go to victims of Japanese earthquake .

'Unethical': Judge Wade McCree reportedly got a witness pregnant after working on her case . A Detroit judge has been placed on leave after texting topless pictures of himself to a married bailiff been accused of getting a witness pregnant while presiding over her child support case. Michigan Judge Wade McCree was placed on leave Friday, sources told The Detroit News. McCree, who is married, allegedly had an affair with  Geniene La'Shay Mott after she brought her ex-boyfriend into his court for failing to pay child support. The lovers even allegedly exchanged text messages discussing potential punishments for her former boyfriend, Robert King, who served jail time following the case. The accusations come just three months after McCree was forced to apologise - and barely held onto his job - after sending nude photographs of himself to a female colleague. Coming forward with these latest claims, his alleged mistress told MyFoxDetroit.com: 'I met him as a litigant, a complaining witness in his courtroom, and he stayed around after the case was over and that's when... our relationship picked up. 'It went from being a summer fling . and just something to do... to falling in love, promises of marriage, me . getting pregnant, us buying a house together, name it.' After McCree's wife found out about the baby, the couple separated but Mott said she will keep the child, despite McCree offering her 'anything she . wanted' to have an abortion, she said. She added that she decided to speak out about the . affair after he went to the Wayne County prosecutor claiming she . was stalking him. Investigators found his complaints baseless, Fox . reported. Affair: McCree allegedly promised Geniene La'Shay Mott, both pictured, he would get divorced and marry her . Together: But he allegedly had a change of heart after his wife found out about her pregnancy . But there had been a time when she had wanted him around, Mott said, and described their sexual encounters in his . chambers, and how she had even gone with him to deliver his divorce papers. And alleged text messages between Mott and McCree shown to Fox  allegedly reveal the couple talking about King's punishment in the child support case, discussing his options. 'OK, The math will be based on his . failures since being placed on probation, but if U'r right. The threat . of jail will loosen his purse strings!' an alleged text from McCree said. Another message apparently shows his fears that the relationship will be discovered. 'My judicial tenure commission has me nervous, as you might . expect,' it read. 'I have to be real careful until this matter is put to rest. 'You . are the complaining witness on a case that is before me. Naturally if it . got out that we were seeing each other before your BD's [baby daddy]'s . case closed everybody could be in deep s***. Speaking out: Mott said she decided to speak to Fox News about the affair after McCree went to a prosecutor to claim she was stalking him - claims which investigators found were baseless . 'Why you want to spend time . with a man like me remains a mystery but if you'll have me... then as Bill Withers said, 'use me up!' SMOOCHES.' And further messages show he had a change of heart about the relationship and buying a home together after McCree's wife, Laverne, found out about . the pregnancy. Under fire: He previously had to apologise for sending topless pictures to a colleague . 'I WANT . (AND SO DOES LAVERNE) THIS TERMINATION,' one text read. 'U'LL GET . WHATEVER U WANT 4 IT! I'VE BEEN CLEAR ON IT FROM THE GET GO! WHATEVER U . WANT YOU SHALL HAVE!' McCree refused to comment on the allegations. Mott said she realised people who heard about her situation would tell her 'she knew what she was getting into messing with a married man'. But . 'I believed him with everything,' she said. 'His actions showed me that . he was leaving. He filed for divorce. I mean, there was nothing to say . that we weren't moving forward.' No criminal action will be taken against . Mott, the Wayne County prosecutor's office told Fox, and the matter . is being referred to the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission. It . comes as yet more trouble for McCree, who barely held on to his job . after it emerged he had sent topless pictures of himself to a court . employee. McCree admitted in April that he had sent the picture to bailiff LaDawnn Malone in 2006 and initially boasted about physique, memorably saying: 'I've got no shame in my game.' 'I've sent that out to other women,' he said. 'There's nothing nude about it. I'm in no more clothes than I'll be at . the Y this afternoon when I swim my mile.' But . the judge soon backtracked and issued a public apology, saying: 'I am . embarrassed and truly sorry for my actions, which have hurt and caused . great pain to my family.' A . ruling issued by the Michigan Supreme Court allowed McCree to . keep his job, but ordered that he be publicly censured for his antics. Outrage: She had been in court over child support from her ex partner, Robert King (pictured), and allegedly discussed his potential punishments over texts with the judge while the case continued . The . court declared that the judge 'conducted himself in a flippant manner . and did not give the interview the seriousness he should have. He brought shame and obloquy to the judiciary.' The bailiff's husband added: 'It's totally inappropriate. It says a lot . that he's flawed. 'He's . been looked upon as some great figure but, as you can see according to . the picture, you see what he's really all about. 'What kind of man would . send this to a married woman, knowing he's a married man himself?'","Judge Wade McCree was put on leave Friday .

A Wisconsin father of nine who's behind on child support payments has allegedly agreed with a judge's order not to have any more children until he can show he can provide for them. Corey Curtis, who fathered the children with six women, owes nearly $100,000 in back child support and interest, according to Racine County prosecutors. In sentencing the 44-year-old father Monday in Racine County Circuit Court for failing to pay support, Judge Tim Boyle lamented that he didn't have the authority to order sterilization for Curtis. Scroll Down for Video . Deadbeat dad: Corey Curtis, 44, of Racine, Wisconsin, owes about $90,000 in back child support and interest to the six mothers of his nine children . 'Common sense dictates you shouldn't have kids you can't afford,' the judge said. Assistant District Attorney Rebecca Sommers told the judge he did have some authority regarding Curtis' reproduction rights. Sommers cited a 2001 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling upholding a judge's power to order a defendant, as a condition of probation, to not procreate again unless he can show he can financially support the child. 'I will make that a condition of the probation,' Boyle said immediately, sentencing Curtis to three years' probation. Defense attorney Robert Peterson argued the probation condition was not recommended in Curtis' pre-sentencing investigation report by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, The Journal Times reported. Curtis told WDJT-TV he planned to comply with the condition. Deadbeat dad: Luther Crawford of Kentucky, who had 12 children with 11 women, was ordered to stop having sex in an effort to keep him from having his 13th child . 'Judges, they make rulings,' Curtis said, 'they make them kind of hastily. So, if that's what he feels one of my conditions should be then I'm going to abide by it.' The July 2001 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling affirming the probation condition involved a case from Manitowoc County. David Oakley had been charged with seven counts of failing to support his nine children, . The justices said that Oakley's constitutional right to procreate wasn't eliminated because he could still reproduce as long as he made child support payments. Curtis’ record includes convictions for passing bad checks, criminal damage and burglary.

A rare collection of Meissen ceramics valued at more than £1million will go under the hammer at top auction house Bonhams, in London, this week. Among the lots expected to spark a bidding war is an elaborately decorated Hausmalar eagle teapot and cover, made in around 1715 and valued at between £25,000 and £35,000. Lavishly finished with a gilt eagle spout and gilt ear-shaped handle, the piece depicts four figures beneath a golden tree. The lid, which attaches to the handle and spout by a chain, is covered with birds perched on branches. Time for tea: Bonhams ceramics specialist Nette Megens admires the rare Meissen Hausmalar eagle teapot and cover expected to fetch between £25,000 and £35,000 . Gilding: The ornately decorated teapot features a gilt eagle spout and gilt ear-shaped handle and a lid depicting birds perched on branches . Among the other 80 stunning lots set for auction on Wednesday is a chocolate beaker bearing a coat of arms, which is expected to fetch £25,000 to £30,000. Originally part of a set of six beakers, it was given as a wedding present to the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony for her marriage in 1738 to Charles VII, King of Naples. The young bride was only 14 years old when her marriage was arranged by her father, King Augustus III, successor of Augustus the Strong, who first set up the Meissen porcelain factory near Dresden. The beaker is one of the few surviving pieces from the wedding present, which originally comprised six teabowls and saucers and six chocolate beakers. Collectors will also be able to bid for a very rare early Meissen part tea and coffee service valued at up to £100,000, and a chamberpot, known as a bourdalou, which is expected to fetch as much as £60,000.

Production of porcelain at Meissen near Dresden started in 1710. It was the dominant style of European porcelain among royals and nobility until around 1756. The Meissen collection being sold by Mr Marouf and his wife Roswitha is one of the world’s biggest and most highly regarded. Sebastian Kuhn, Bonhams’ director of European porcelain, said: 'The Said and Roswitha Marouf Collection is without doubt one of the most important collections of 18th century Meissen porcelain to come to the market. 'It is incredible to see such a selection of fine pieces, including some rare and intimate items from the royal toilette, with fascinating provenance.

Paramedics were called to a drunken Shakespeare show performed by Sussex University students . Paramedics were called to help student actors who had more than their fair share of Dutch courage before a Shakespeare performance, which saw them staggering on stage and smashing up the set. The boozed-up thespians, members of the Sussex University Drama Society (SUDS), had deliberately downed drinks just minutes before their show which featured scenes from Macbeth and A Midsummer Night's Dream. One audience member told The Badger, the student newspaper for Sussex University: 'I saw Lady Macbeth smash a glass jug on the ground.' Others reported the director had to take one actor off stage after he entered at the wrong scene, during the show at a bar in Falmer, East Sussex. The opening night sold 100 tickets and seemed popular with the audience, with one member calling it 'really impressive and entertaining.' But the booze-fuelled show was cancelled after the second night when an ambulance was called for an actress in her early 20s. A message on the Sussex University Drama Society Facebook page said the cast and crew were 'devastated' by the decision to cancel the show, and added: 'The decision was taken understandably by Falmer Bar after some of the drunk actors got out of control, putting their safety at risk.' 'We never want to place Falmer Bar in that position.' An investigation has been launched by the Students' Union. Society President Jacob Jackson and publicity officer Rachael Welsh have both stepped down from their positions. Kit Bradshaw, communications officer for the University of Sussex Students' Union, said: 'SUDS staged a show in Falmer Bar on the University of Sussex campus on Monday, 19 November and Tuesday, 20 November. 'Due to a number of incidents during those performances, the final night's show, due to take place on Wednesday, 21 November, was cancelled.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:30 EST, 11 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:47 EST, 11 December 2012 . An international study has revealed that students in U.S. schools perform better than the global average, but still lag behind many of their peers in Asia and Europe. Fourth-graders have improved their scores in reading and math over the past four years, according to a study released Tuesday. But progress seems to fall off by eighth grade, where math and science scores are stagnant. Meanwhile, kids in countries like Finland and Singapore are outperforming American fourth-graders in science and reading. Lagging behind: Hong-Kong is leading in fourth-grade reading, with the U.S. in sixth place, while Singapore is No 1 in fourth-grade math, 10 spots ahead of the U.S. By eighth grade, American students have fallen behind their Russian, Japanese and Taiwanese counterparts in math, and trail students from Hong Kong, Slovenia and South Korea in science. ‘These 2011 international assessments provide both encouraging news about our students' progress and some sobering cautionary notes,’ said Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who applauded gains among fourth-graders but warned those gains aren't being sustained in later grades. ‘That is unacceptable if our schools are to live up to the American promise of giving all children a world-class education.’ The results of the study, conducted every four years in nations around the world, show mixed prospects for delivering on that promise. A nation that once took pride in being at the top of its game can no longer credibly call itself the global leader in student performance. Wringing their hands about what that reality portends for broader U.S. influence, policymakers worry it could have ripple effects on the economy down the line, with Americans increasingly at a competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace. Numbers game: American eighth-graders are behind their Russian, Japanese and Taiwanese peers, with South Korea and Singapore in the forefront . Elevating the skills needed to compete with emerging countries has been a priority for President Barack Obama, who has pledged to train 100,000 new math and science teachers over the next decade. ‘Think about the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs,’ he said this year in his State of the Union address. The U.S. has a long way to go to reach those goals. In the meantime, other countries are making significant strides. Russian eighth-graders were about tied in math with their American peers in 2007, the last time the study was conducted. Four years later, Russia's scores have surged and now surpass the U.S. by a significant margin. Reading skills are a major strength for American students. Only a few points separate American students from the top-scoring students in the world. In Florida, which took part in the study separately, reading scores are second only to Hong Kong. Asia continues to dominate the top echelon of scores across subject fields. The tiny city-state of Singapore takes first place in eighth-grade science and fourth-grade math, with South Korea scoring nearly as high. Singapore takes second place to South Korea in eighth-grade math, with Taiwan in third. Under the microscope: Singapore takes first place in eighth-grade science, while U.S. is only in the 10th spot . High marks: Eighth-graders in Massachusetts and Minnesota score far better in math and science than the U.S. average . The results also lean toward Asian nations when it comes to advanced levels of learning. In Singapore, four in 10 eighth-graders achieved the ‘advanced benchmark’ in science, which requires an understanding of complex and abstract concepts in physics, chemistry, biology and other sciences. About two in 10 make the grade in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. In the U.S., it's about one in 10. ‘There are a small handful of countries or systems that are managing to get a much larger percentage of their students over the advanced benchmark,’ said Jack Buckley, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. ‘There's clearly some room for improvement.’ Unimpressive: One one in 10 U.S. eighth-graders achieved the 'advanced benchmark' in science, compared to four in 10 in Singapore . The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and its sister test, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, are used to measure knowledge, skills and mastery of curricula by elementary and middle school students around the world. Students in rich, industrialized nations and poor, developing countries alike are tested. In 2011, 56 educational systems — mostly countries, but some states and subnational entities like Hong Kong — took part in math and science exams. Fifty-three systems participated in the reading exam, which included almost 13,000 American fourth-graders. ‘These kinds of tests are very good at telling us who's ahead in the race. They don't have a lot to say about causes or why countries are where they are,’ said Brookings Institution senior fellow Tom Loveless, who in previous years represented the U.S. in the international group that administers the test. Some U.S. states that were measured separately were clear standouts, performing on par with or better than some top-performing Asian countries. Eighth-graders in Massachusetts and Minnesota score far better in math and science than the U.S. average. But in California and Alabama, eighth-graders fell short of the national average. Racial and class disparities are all too real. In eighth grade, Americans in the schools with the highest poverty — those with 75 per cent or more of students on free or reduced-price lunch — performed below both the U.S. average and the lower international average. Silver lining: Only a few points separate American students from the top-scoring students in the world when it comes to reading . Gender gap: Boys do better than girls in fourth-grade science and eighth-grade math, but girls lead in reading . Students at schools with fewer poor kids performed better. In fourth-grade reading, all ethnic groups outperformed the international average, but white and Asian students did better than their black and Hispanic classmates. Boys in the U.S. do better than girls in fourth-grade science and eighth-grade math. But girls rule when it comes to reading. On a global level, the gender gap appears to be closing. About half of the countries showed no statistically meaningful gap between boys and girls in math and science. The tests are carried out by the International Association for Evaluation of Educational Achievement, a coalition of research institutions. The U.S. portion of the exams is coordinated by the Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics.","Hong-Kong is leading in fourth-grade reading, with the U.S. in sixth place .

This morning, thousands of . Brotherhood members gathered in Cairo outside the mosque of Al-Azhar, . Egypt's most respected Islamic institution, for the funeral of two . members of the fundamentalist group who were killed during Wednesday's . clashes. During the funeral, thousands . Islamist mourners chanted, 'with blood and soul, we redeem Islam,' pumping their fists in the air. Egyptian supporters of Muslim Brotherhood carry the coffins of members of the group who were killed in clashes with Egyptian opposition protesters, during their funeral today . 'Egypt is Islamic, it will not be . secular, it will not be liberal,' they chanted as they walked in a . funeral procession that filled streets around Al-Azhar mosque. Ultraconservative Islamists known as Salafis are organizing their own . rally Friday against what they say is biased coverage of the crisis by . private Egyptian satellite TV channels. Speaking outside his palace President Mohammed Morsi gave a fiery speech denouncing his opponents, deepening the crisis. The opposition turned down his appeal for talks, saying the president had not fulfilled their conditions for beginning negotiations. Protesters are demanding that Morsi rescind decrees that give him almost absolute power and push an Islamist-friendly constitution to a referendum on December 15. The coffins were carried from Al-Azhar mosque, in Cairo - supporters and opponents of President Mohamed Morsi had clashed earlier this week in front of the city's presidential palace . Patriotically waving national flags, thousands gathered for another protest against the President's regime as the coffins were carried to the burial site . Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets today after midday prayers in rival rallies and marches across Cairo, as the standoff deepened over what opponents call the Islamist president's power grab . The decrees sparked a crisis that has boiled for more than two weeks. Demonstrations have reached the size and intensity of those that brought down President Hosni Mubarak early last year. In a televised address late yesterday, an angry Morsi refused to call off the vote on the disputed constitution. He accused some in the opposition of serving remnants of Mubarak's regime and vowed he would never tolerate anyone working for the overthrow of his government. He also invited the opposition to a dialogue from Saturday at his palace, but he gave no sign that he might offer any meaningful concessions. Morsi's opponents said they would not talk until Morsi cancels his decrees. Opposition leader and former Presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi waves to the protesters as he gives a speech during a sit-in against the President Mohamed Morsi decree, in Tahrir Square, today . An unidentified Muslim cleric speaks during the Friday noon prayer as anti-Morsi protesters stage a sit-in against the President Mohamed Morsi decree, in Tahrir Square, in Cairo . Anti-Morsi protesters hold a banner reading in Arabic 'Go away' referring to the President Mohamed Morsi during today's protest in the heart of the city . Anti-Morsi protesters perform the Friday noon prayers as tensions in the Egyptian capital city remain high . The president's remarks were his first comments to the public after bloody clashes outside his palace on Wednesday, when thousands of his backers from the Muslim Brotherhood fought with the president's opponents. Six people were killed and at least 700 injured. The speech brought shouts of 'the people want to topple the regime!' from the crowd of 30,000 Morsi opponents gathered outside his palace — the same chant heard in the protests that brought down Mubarak. Since the crisis erupted, the opposition has tried to forge a united front. The squabbling groups created a National Salvation Front to bring them together, naming Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei, the country's top reform campaigner, as its leader. More . demonstrations are planned for the streets of Cairo today after Egypt's . Islamist President Mohamed Mursi failed to calm angry protestors in a . televised speech on national television last night . Moving in: An Egyptian Army tank deploys near the presidential palace to . secure the site after yesterday's overnight clashes between supporters and . opponents of President Mohammed Morsi . Peaceful: . Egyptian Army generals claim they have moved in yesterday to keep the . peace between rival groups who have clashed outside the . presidential palace . Making a grab for power: An Egyptian army tank is seen behind barbed . wire securing the perimeter of the presidential palace in Cairo yesterday . Speaking on the new umbrella group's behalf, ElBaradei responded to Morsi's speech in his own televised remarks, saying that Morsi's government showed reluctance in acting to stop Wednesday night's bloodshed outside the palace. He said this failure has eroded the government's legitimacy and made it difficult for his opposition front to negotiate with the president. ElBaradei said Morsi has not responded to the opposition group's attempts to 'rescue the country' and that the president had 'closed the door for dialogue' by 'ignoring the demands of the people.' Crisis: Tension has been building ever since President Morsi passed measures giving him almost total control over Egypt on November 22 . Deadly: Seven people have died and hundreds more have been injured amid violent clashes in Cairo . Faith and force: Army soldiers install barbed wire, as supporters of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi pray in the background . After today's prayers, protesters began marching to the palace from several different directions. The April 6 movement, which played a key role in sparking the uprising against Mubarak, called its supporters to gather at mosques in Cairo and the neighboring city of Giza to march to the palace. Egypt's military intervened for the first time yesterday, posting tanks around the palace and stringing barbed wire. The military played a crucial role in ending Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule by taking over from him to manage a transitional period, but it has stayed out of the latest crisis until now. The recent clashes are the first time rival groups have fought openly in the streets. Thousands of Mr Morsi's Islamist supporters descended on an area near the presidential palace where 300 opponents were staging a sit-in. The fighting erupted late on Wednesday when members of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood chased the protesters away from their base outside the palace's main gate and tore down their tents. After a brief lull, hundreds of opponents arrived and began throwing firebombs at the president's backers, who responded with rocks. Tanks: The Egyptian Army has moves in yesterday but promises not to repress demonstrators on either side . Appeal for unity: The United States and Britain have called for restraint and an 'inclusive' political process . The crowds swelled and the clashes continued well after nightfall, spreading from the immediate vicinity of the palace to residential streets nearby. Hundreds of riot police could not stop the fighting as officers fired tear gas in a bid to disperse Mr Morsi's opponents. Volunteers ferried the wounded on motorcycles to waiting ambulances, which rushed them to hospitals. By . dawn, the violence had calmed, but both sides appeared to be digging in . for a long struggle, with the opposition vowing more protests later . today and rejecting any dialogue unless the charter is rescinded.

The United States, worried about the . stability of an Arab state which has a peace deal with Israel and which . receives $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid, urged dialogue.

Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekky proposed 'personal ideas' for a negotiated way out yesterday, saying . amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with . the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be . elected after this month's referendum on the constitution. But the opposition stuck by its demand for Mr Morsi to cancel . the November 22 decree and postpone the referendum before any dialogue. Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. But Mr Mursi has shown no sign of . buckling under pressure from protesters, confident that the Islamists, . who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown, can win . the referendum and the parliamentary election to follow.

As the Spice Girls prepare to reunite briefly next week for the premiere of their new musical Viva Forever! and a major new TV show, there’s a growing prospect this might not be the final chapter for the world’s most successful girl group. The pressure to get back together is being driven by Melanie Brown — Scary Spice — who has been in Australia judging a version of The X Factor there. In her first interview about the stage production and highly anticipated ITV Christmas special, she reveals: ‘I keep saying to the girls, “Let’s reunite and tour again!” I’m up for it and I’m always championing it.’ Getting back together? The Spice Girls - from left to right, Mel B, Mel C, Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton and Victoria Beckham - could be considering a longer-term reunion . While Victoria Beckham was believed to have ruled out performing with her bandmates — Mel B, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell —again, their well-received outing at the closing ceremony of London 2012 may have changed that. ‘We didn’t get paid for the Olympics — we funded it ourselves, costumes and everything. It just goes to show how much we do get on and do like each other. But it’s easier said than done with our schedules,’ Mel adds. 'We're like sisters': Melanie Brown is said to be pushing for the group to get back together . ‘We’re like sisters. We can bicker and make comments to each other. We go through highs and lows together. We go through fallouts and make-ups and break-ups. That’s just the way we are.‘We’re five very passionate, creative girls. But we love each other and we’re like family. Well, the family you want to have.’ Mel could be referring to her high profile rift with her mum Andrea, who, I revealed, will not feature in the ITV documentary. ‘Not all the Spice Mums did the documentary,’ Mel says. ‘All I said during filming was that I adore my family. All of us love our mothers.’ ITV’s cameras followed Mel for a ‘few days’ and she found it emotional looking back at the band’s career. ‘It was really nice to be able to reflect,’ she says. ‘It makes you feel humble and appreciative of where you come from. I owe everything to the Spice Girls. I wouldn’t be able to live or travel like I do if it wasn’t for those four other girls.’ The world premiere of Viva Forever! on Tuesday at London’s Piccadilly Theatre will see the Spice Girls attend with their partners, including David Beckham. Victoria’s husband’s attendance has excited ITV producers because it means he will now feature in the Spice TV show. A star audience: David Beckham, left, will be joining his wife Victoria Beckham, right, at the premiere of Viva Forever!

For weeks, viewers have asked why Strictly Come Dancing’s judges have given Olympic gymnast Louis Smith tougher scores and critiques than his rivals. It was only after his near-flawless performance on Saturday that Len Goodman, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Darcey Bussell began to award him marks comparable to front-runner Denise Van Outen. I’m told that’s because staff on the show are well aware the heart-throb has been topping the viewers’ phone vote for weeks and is almost assured a place in the final on December 22. Tough critics: Olympic gymnast Louis Smith pictured with dancer Flavia Cacace on Strictly Come Dancing . My Strictly source reveals: ‘It’s been known behind the scenes for weeks now that Louis is a sure bet for the final. As a result, the judges knew there was no point giving him nines and tens every week because it would allow him no progression throughout the series. ‘To be truthful, they have marked him harder than the other dancers because he is a gymnast who has a natural advantage over a rival like Lisa Riley.’ While I don’t want to see the judges going easy on the celebs, it’s been clear to me they’ve been marking Louis, 23, down unfairly for weeks. If anything, that has only increased his support with the public. Barring a huge surprise over the next two weeks, it’s hard to see a scenario where he won’t become this year’s king of the dancefloor. ITV will premiere The McFly Show tomorrow night — a 1970s-style variety programme fronted by the popular boyband. If it’s a success, the one-off edition could be developed into a weekly series, featuring comedy sketches and performances. ‘It’s something we’ve been working on for a long time and we hope it could become something more regular,’ drummer and last year’s Strictly winner Harry Judd tells me.",Girl group back together next week for premiere of their new musical Viva Forever! and a major new TV show .

A police report shows that the meat came from the Swift Packing Plant in Greeley, Colorado, and is marked with the date June 8, 2011. Greeley police say that they are reviewing cases to see if the gun had been used in any crimes.

Egypt’s top court said it was suspending its work indefinitely to protest against the ‘psychological assassination’ of its judges. The declaration came after supporters of the country’s Islamist president prevented the judges from entering the courthouse yesterday. The strike is the latest turn in a crisis pitting President Mohammed Morsi and his Islamist allies against the mostly secular opposition. New powers: An Egyptian man shows support for President Mohamed Morsi, whose new legislation extends immunity to the panel drafting the constitution . The standoff began when Morsi issued a . package of decrees on Nov. 22 that gave him sweeping powers and . extended immunity from the courts to a panel tasked with drafting a new . constitution. The . Islamist-dominated panel then raced in a marathon session last week to . vote on the new charter’s 230 clauses without the participation of . liberal and Christian members. The . fast-track hearing preempted a decision expected from the court on . Sunday on whether to dissolve the committee - a ruling the judges . postponed on Sunday. Morsi . announced at the weekend that he would hold a referendum on the draft . charter on December 15, despite opposition protests and questions about . the document’s legitimacy. Fed up: An Anti Morsi protestor holds up a placard which reads: 'No to a dictator. Morsi is to Egypt as Hitler was to Germany. Too much authority and power lead to corruption' Protesting powers: Rallies were held across Egypt, including this one in Cairo, as a result of President Morsi's decree broadening his powers and giving him immunity . New dictator: Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi has been accused of turning into a new Hosni Mubarak . 'It is the Egyptian judiciary’s blackest . day on record,' the court said in a statement carried by the official . MENA news agency, describing the scene outside the court complex, with . Islamists carrying banners denouncing the tribunal and some of its . judges. Supporters of Morsi, who hails from the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, claim that the court’s judges are loyalists of ousted president Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak appointed them to their positions, and Morsi supporters say they are trying to derail the country’s transition to democratic rule. The court statement said the judges approached the court but decided against entering the building because they feared for their safety. 'The judges of the Supreme Constitutional Court were left with no choice but to announce to the glorious people of Egypt that they cannot carry out their sacred mission in this charged atmosphere,' the statement said. The judges also were expected to rule to on the legitimacy of the Islamist-dominated upper house of parliament, known as the Shura Council. By suspending its work, the court joined the country’s highest appeals court and its sister lower court in their indefinite strike to protest what they see as Morsi’s infringement on the judiciary.

Cheers: A team of archaeologists have been toasting the discovery of a Bronze Age 'microbrewery' in western Cyprus . We are often warned not to overindulge in more than a glass or two of our favourite tipple, but it seems that we may owe some of our drinking habits to our Bronze Age ancestors. A team of archaeologists are toasting their latest find - a 'microbrewery' dating back some 3,500 years. The two metres by two metres mud-plaster domed structure, which the group says was used as a kiln to dry malt and make beer, was found in western Cyprus. Beers of different flavours would have been brewed from malted barley and fermented with yeasts with an alcoholic content of around 5 per cent - much the same as a modern day beer. The yeast would have either been wild or produced from fruit such as grape or fig, according to the researchers. Dr Lindy Crewe, from the University of Manchester, who has led the excavation at the Early-Middle Bronze Age settlement of Kissonerga-Skalia, near Paphos, since 2007, said: 'Archaeologists believe beer drinking was an important part of society from the Neolithic onwards and may have even been the main reason that people began to cultivate grain in the first place. 'But it's extremely rare to find the remains of production preserved from thousands of years ago so we're very excited. 'The excavation of the malting kiln with associated sets of pottery types and tools left in place gives us a fantastic opportunity to look at Bronze Age tool kits and figure out techniques and recipes.' The discovery was found at one end of a 50 metre square courtyard with a plastered floor. As well as the 'microbrewery', the group also found grinding tools and mortars which may have been used to break down the grain after it was malted, a small hearth and cooking pots made of clay said to have been used to cook the beer gently. They also found juglets, which they believe probably contained yeast additives or sweeteners to produce beers of different strengths or flavours. The beers' ingredients were found by the team as carbonised seeds. The malting kiln seen in the far end of a large courtyard with plastered floor from Kissonerga-Skalia. Dr Crewe added: 'Beer was commonly drunk because it is more nutritious than bread and less likely to contain harmful pathogens than drinking water which can make you ill. 'But alcoholic beverages were also used to oil the wheels of business and pleasure in much the same way as today. Work brought communities together for tasks such as bringing in the harvest or erecting special buildings. 'Instead of payment, participants are rewarded with a special feast, often involving quantities of alcohol which also transformed the work from a chore into a social event. 'The people of the Bronze Age, it seems, were well aware of the relaxing properties of alcohol.' Success: The team of archaeologists from the University of Manchester pictured working on site in western Cyprus . An experimental archaeology team, led by Ian Hill of Heritage and Archaeological Research Practice Archaeology, recreated the drying kiln using traditional techniques to test Dr Crewe's theory in August, said the university. The modern version used hot air to produce a temperature of 65C - perfect conditions for heating and drying grains but still preserving its enzymes and proteins. And Mr Hill said that the beers produced weren't half bad. He said: 'After the beers had been strained, we felt they were all pretty drinkable, though some varieties were better than others. 'The grape was less pleasant - a bit too sweet - the outcomes are less reliable when using wild yeasts, compared to brewer's yeast, but the fig beer was definitely the most popular.'","The team from the University of Manchester made the rare discovery in western Cyprus .

Court battle: Judges at the London Technology and Construction Court ruled in favour of a decision to stop a businessman carrying out piling work on his home on an estate owned by the Duke of Westminster's (pictured) A businessman has been banned from carrying out piling work in the basement of his home in an exclusive London street after taking on one of Britain's richest landowners in court. George Papamarkakis wanted to carry out the work as part of plans to extensively develop the basement in his home on Chester Row, but was denied permission by the Duke of Westminster's Grovesnor Estate. The Estate argued that the work would cause 'significant nuisance to the neighbours and nearby residents' and was 'likely to damage neighbouring properties'. Unhappy with the decision, Mr Papamarkakis took his fight to London's Technology and Construction Court but today failed to get the Estate's decision overturned. Judges dismissed his argument that the Estate had taken the 'wrong mental attitude' towards him and let 'animus' cloud its judgement. Mr Papamarkis had gained planning consent to modernise the property above and below ground last year after buying the house as a home for himself, his wife and their two daughters. But the hedge fund manager also needed permission from the Grovesnor Estate who gave the thumbs up to his above ground plans but refused to give the green light to plans for the home's basement. His company, Constance Long . Term Holdings Ltd, was also refused permission to carry out piling work . - a prerequisite for any future basement extension. Lawyers argued that consent to the . piling had been 'unreasonably refused' by the estate and that the works . were essential to make the property 'future proof' and keep open the . option of developing the basement at some point in the future. Constance vehemently denied claims that . it had not always followed 'best practice' in the past and that it had 'deliberately sought to hide away the piling details in the documents in . the hope or expectation that Grosvenor Estate would not notice them'. Appeal: George Papamarkakis lost his appeal at the Tecnology and Construction Court . While Judge Justice Ramsey dismissed Constance's claims that the plans had been refused due to 'animus' or a 'wrong mental attitude' on the part of a senior Estate employee, he also said that criticisms of Mr Papamarkakis' holding company were unjustified. Despite expressing 'some sympathy' for Mr Papamarkakis' frustration at the lack of approval, the judge ruled that the Estate had been entitled to withhold consent . due to the 'significant additional disruption' to neighbours the work . would entail, in terms of dust, noise and extra time taken to complete . the job. He added that the piling work was not necessary for the above ground project.

Then that's why you're probably not an artist. However, Gustav Metzger, who really is an artist - and one of some renown - did wonder how his empty mind might appear if made corporeal. To find out he hooked himself up to an electroencephalograph scanner connected to a robot carving machine, then tried not to think. What thinking about nothing looks like: Art and technology group London Fieldworks hooked up celebrated sculptor Gustav Metzger to an EEG scanner connected to a robot sculpting machine and got this . The result was this void space in the middle of a block of Portland stone, now on display at London's Work Gallery. The shape carved out from the lump of rock is pictured below. The project was the idea of art and technology group London Fieldworks, whose members developed bespoke software to translate Metzger's brainwaves into 3D shape information. This data was translated into instructions for a manufacturing robot, which carved out the shapes from the interior of a block of stone to create the curious sculpture. The project utilised a relational database comprising of several hundred digital EEG recordings from participants who have donated their brainwaves from the UK, Europe and U.S. These EEGs were recorded while the participants perceived 3-dimensional depth information within autostereograms and were instrumental in the translation of Metzger's EEG into instructions for the manufacturing robot to create the sculpture, London Fieldworks said. Strange: The shape of the space carved out from inside the stone . As well as the sculptural representation of Gustav Metzger thinking about nothing, exhibits will include a film of the carving of the stone as well as other documentation of the development and delivery of the work.

He speculated that the Napoleon letter could have fetched as much as $325,000 (£202,820). 'This is a nice letter because it's in code, and he's going to blow up the Kremlin - so it's appealing,' he said. Vladimir Hofmann, a French artist of Russian descent who with his brother Andre also bid today, said they'd wanted to purchase the letter for Russia's famed Hermitage museum. 'Why? You know, it's a question of perhaps nostalgia, perhaps patriotism, to return the thing - very important for Russia and for Russian people - to them,' Vladimir Hofmann said. Referring to such Russian interest in the letter, Lheritier said with a chuckle: 'I prefer that it stays in France.'","1812 letter show history's famed general at one of his weakest moments .

As the heart of Middle Earth, who could blame the country for its overzealous support for the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Especially when New Zealand's tourism revenue is to rise by up to £250m annually because of the hit films. And Hobbit mania erupted in New Zealand's capital today for the world premier of Peter Jackson's new movie, with as many as 100,000 fans - many in costume - gathering to catch a glimpse of the stars. In full spirit, a weatherman dressed as an elf as he presented the weather in Elvish on a New Zealand breakfast show this morning. Scroll down for video . Good morning Middle-earth! New Zealanders woke up to a rather unusual weather forecast this morning ahead of The Hobbit premiere . The weather map covered Middle Earth and, in particular, the Shire, also known as Hobbiton . The forecast confirmed 'they appear fair the lands, and a season good for wanderers' And politicians sitting in Parliament burst into raucous laughter as National minister Steven Joyce adapted JR Tolkein's work, referring to a 'fellowship', and comparing a politician to a 'wizard' and another to a 'slimy, bearded creature'.

The forecast by TVNZ confirmed, 'they appear fair the lands, and a season good for wanderers'. Host Tamati Coffey's transformation into an Elf happened gradually over the course of the morning's broadcast with the aid of an Elf costume, makeup and wig. He spoke in Sindarin - a language that was spoken in conversation between various Elves and friends of Elves in Middle Earth. He had been coached by dialect specialist Leith McPherson, who also coached the Elven cast during filming of The Hobbit Trilogy.

Going all out: The fans spared no expense to dress up for the event, with many of them wearing elaborate costumes .

Joyce said he had heard of one, featuring a fellowship 'led by a tall, thinning grey wizard who surrounds himself with a loyal legion of halflings sworn to protect him against a slimy, bearded creature hiding and plotting in the darkness, consumed by jealousy, and relentlessly in pursuit of his ""precious"".' At this point the roars of laughter - including from that 'wizard' - David Shearer - and the 'slimy bearded creature' - David Cunliffe - nearly drowned out Mr Joyce.

Darel Agerton, 38, of Joliet, Illinois, was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon for the November 30 death of Veronica Schick, whose unconscious body was found on the floor of her home. Agerton was staying at Schick's home at the time of his grandmother's death. Accused of murder: Darel C. Agerton, 38, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon for the death of his grandmother, whose unconscious body was found on the floor of her home . Agerton dialed 911 for an ambulance and police were called in to assist after paramedics arrived at the home, a local Patch site reports. Agerton told the emergency responders that he awoke from a nap to find his grandmother unresponsive and laying on the floor, according to a release from the local sheriff's office. When investigators called Agerton in for questioning, he made statements that were inconsistent with his original story, the release says. Undisclosed physical evidence was also allegedly found at the scene. ‘It was very suspicious,’ Will County sheriff's spokesman Ken Kaupas was quoted as saying. Prosecutors say Agerton beat his grandmother with his hands and feet and strangled her in her home.

All the trimmings: Cash-strapped families can have a Christmas turkey dinner for as little as £2.51 per person . Austerity-hit families can deliver a turkey dinner with all the trimmings for as little as £2.51 per person, according to a high street study. The figure is lower than the £3 a head charged in 2009 and follows a move by supermarkets to introduce new cheaper value lines to attract struggling customers. The prices come from a study by the Good Housekeeping Institute which claims it is possible to feed eight people on the big day for a total of just £20.12. Many families will spend more than that on a turkey, while the figure is also less than the price of a bottle of champagne such as Moet et Chandon. The Institute has taste tested the cheap festive meal, which includes mince pies, brandy butter and an 85p Christmas pudding, and insists it is a perfectly acceptable and tasty option. Researchers surveyed prices across seven major food retailers including Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Asda and Lidl. Putting together the cheapest menu involves shopping around, with the budget stores Aldi and Lidl, together with Morrisons providing most of the items. While Morrisons came out as the cheapest single source of all the ingredients for those who want to do all their festive shopping in a single outlet. Lidl provided the cheapest turkey a 4.8kg Glenfell frozen bird at just £9.99, while it is also selling a 2.5kg bag of Maris Piper potatoes for £1.79. Shopping around: Researchers taste tested the cheap festive meal which included mince pies (left) and Christmas pudding (right) and insist it is a perfectly acceptable, tasty option . Aldi was the best option for sprouts and parsnips which were both 78p a kilo. The Morrisons ‘M Saver’ range was the cheapest for carrots at 55p a kilo, brandy butter at £1 for 200g, and cranberry sauce at 50p for 185g. It also offered the cheapest Christmas pudding at just 85p for the 454g centrepiece. Asda’s Smartprice Christmas cake is on the menu at just £1.05 for 454g, while Sainsbury’s provides the Basic puff pastry mince pies at 63p for eight. The Tesco contribution to the meal is its Everyday Value sage and onion stuffing mix at 15p for an 85g packet. Budget products from Sainsbury’s and Morrisons were the same price. Consumer director at the institute’s Good Housekeeping magazine, Caroline Bloor said: ‘We cooked up Christmas dinner from our budget basket of groceries and can report that the items taste as good as they are cheap.’ Single source: Morrisons came out as the cheapest place to source all festive ingredients . The total price of the budget feast has come down for three years in a row according to the organisation’s annual survey. She said: ‘The supermarkets are focusing hard on keeping down the cost of Christmas essentials but they’ll need to make the profits up somewhere. So people need to keep an eye on the kind of luxury items that we like to fill our baskets up with at this time of year.’ The Institute’s research cannot compare food products that are identical, rather it looks at the cheapest possible product from each outlet. Buying all the ingredients from Morrisons came in at £21.10, with Tesco proving to be second cheapest at £28.97. At the other end of the scale, the cheapest menu for eight at Marks & Spencer was £54.33, while Waitrose was the most expensive at £56.23. Significantly, the study does not include the all-important, and very expensive, drink from the Bucks Fizz for breakfast to the sherry, wine and spirits enjoyed during the rest of the day.

One of only two prototypes of the very first magnetic strip credit cards developed by IBM is up for sale for the first time. Sotheby's are offering the relic of financial history for sale at their New York branch, with an estimate of between $10,000 to $15,000. Made of card, with its magnetic strips printed stuck somewhat askew across both sides, the card has been carried for nearly 50 years in the wallet of its developer Jerome Svigals. Relic of financial history: This unassuming oblong of brown card is one of only two of the original prototypes of the modern day credit card developed by IBM in the late Sixties . Credited with making possible today's trillion dollar consumer credit industry, the card is a unique piece of financial history. While credit cards for individual companies had been in use in the U.S. since the Twenties, it was only in the Fifties that the idea of a universal credit card came into general use and acceptance. However, these raised letter cards required extensive customer service and substantial time to process. Seeking to create an application that would increase computer sales, IBM set about transforming the raised letter credit card to make it more efficient. Going under the hammer: The card is available for sale at Sotheby's at an auction set for December 14, with an estimate of between £10,000 and $15,000 . Also going under the hammer in the same auction as the IBM prototype credit card is this complete microfilm Bible, thought to be the very first book to make it to the moon. One of 100 tiny Good Books carried aboard Apollo 14 on behalf of the Apollo Prayer League, the microfilm comes complete with a letter of certification signed by Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell and James Stout of the prayer league's 'Governing Committee'. NASA’s weight restrictions prohibited the transport of a convention book to the moon so in lieu of a large heavy codex, so microfilm was used to condense the 1,245 page King Hames version into the tiny 1.5in square. Mitchell carried the microform bibles aboard the lunar module Antares, which landed on the Fra Mauro Highlands of the Moon on February 5, 1971. The company's Advanced Systems Team, . headed by Mr Svigals and Forrest Parry, settled on magnetic tape as the . only convenient data storage method capable of easily accessing the . necessary alphanumeric information. Once the engineers decided on magnetic tape, the biggest challenge was designing a durable, inexpensive card. The earliest trials were done on cardboard, but quick progress with the invention meant that only two such prototypes were made before the plastic card was developed. 'IBM did the work for free and didn’t even patent the machine-readable card it came up with,' Mr Svigals said. 'Rather, it offered its solution gratis to all, assuming that the more transactions conducted using machine-readable media, the more computers would be sold to process them. 'The strategy worked beyond anyone’s dreams.' American Express in 1970 became the first company to take up IBM's new design, issuing 250,000 plastic magnetic strip cards which for the first time allowed customers to transact directly with banks and airport kiosks. Consumers and the rest of the banks quickly adopted the idea and, by last year, more than 20billion credit card transactions were recorded in the U.S. alone. Mr Svigals' prototype card goes on sale December 14 as part of a fine books and manuscripts sale at Sotheby's in New York. On one side the magnetic strip has come away and been stuck back down with sellotape, but it is not thought to have affected the value of the almost unique item. The only other example is kept at the Computer History Museum in California.","One of only two in existence - the other is held in California's Computer History Museum .

But Sainbury's workers' Maggie, 60, and Mike Davies, 63, created a wedding fund with a twist when they spent 18 months collecting 40,000 loyalty points which paid for all the food when they tied the knot. The maximum they would have had to spend to get the points is £20,000 - but the couple guess they only spent £5,000 . Scroll down for video . Maggie and Mike Davies pictured in the car park of their local Sainsbury's on their wedding day. The pair met whilst working in the supermarket . Using their Nectar points they managed to put together a sumptuous buffet to feed all 140 of their guests. The Davies, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, spent the £200 worth of points on a feast of sandwiches, quiches, sausage rolls and desserts. Mr Davies said: 'The food went down very well. The points paid for everything food wise, the only extra thing we had to get was the gateau which Sainsbury's didn't do.' They met working at the supermarket and a choir of  their colleagues sang at the ceremony. The pair, who both still work at the shop, mainly collected in-store but also  by paying their British Gas bill online. Normally two Nectar points are awarded . per £1 spent. They . believe they spent roughly £200 a month on food shopping and bought . 'everything', including Mrs Davies honeymoon wardrobe, in the shop. Mr . Davies said: 'We definitely didn't spend £20,000 getting the points - . we work at Sainsbury's and don't spend that much in a year. It would be . less than half, probably a quarter, of that.' Maggie and Mike Davies, pictured in a less traditional type of aisle on their big day, used the points to pay for their wedding buffet . Mrs Davies added: 'If we went through the tills and were given a voucher that says you get a thousand points to buy this product then we would actually go out of our way to get that product.' Deli worker Mrs Davies, nee Alderman, added: 'It would have been really tight without the points. 'Our big day could not have been more perfect - it was more than I could ever have imagined.'

Supermarkets that deal with suppliers unfairly could be fined by a new industry regulator, it was revealed today. New rules to be introduced by Competition Minister Jo Swinson will give the Groceries Code Adjudicator the power to name and shame offenders. It will also be able to suggest recommendations and levy fines against companies found to have breached industry guidelines. A new watchdog, the Groceries Code Adjudicator, will be given the power to name and shame supermarkets that treat farmers unfairly . Ms Swinson said: 'Where supermarkets are breaking the rules with suppliers and treating them unfairly, the adjudicator will make sure that they are held to account. 'We have heard the views of the stakeholders who were keen to give the adjudicator a power to fine, and recognise that this change would give the adjudicator more teeth to enforce the Groceries Code.' The change was immediately attacked by the British Retail Consortium as 'unnecessary and heavy-handed'. British Retail Consortium director general Stephen Robertson told The Daily Telegraph: 'We’ve long maintained that the power to impose fines is unnecessary and heavy-handed and should be kept in reserve. 'This flies in the face of common sense and is yet another piece of disproportionate legislation aimed at food retailers. 'It's a major let-down and makes it even more important that retailers are given a full right of appeal against being fined or ""named and shamed"".' The British Retail Consortium immediately attacked the plans as 'unnecessary and heavy-handed' The new adjudicator is expected to publish guidelines on its approach to sanctions within six months of the new Bill coming into effect, expected some time next year. As well as fining companies the adjudicator will be able to arbitrate disputes between retailers and suppliers and investigate confidential complaints from direct and indirect suppliers. Ms Swinson said: 'The food industry plays an important role in economic growth, and the Groceries Code Adjudicator will help to ensure that the market is operating in a fair and healthy way. 'Large supermarkets form a big chunk of this industry, and generally provide consumers with low prices and variety whilst providing business for farmers and suppliers.'","New Groceries Code Adjudicator will have .

A U.S. drone strike has killed a senior al Qaeda leader described as the second in command of the terrorist organisation. Sheik Khalid bin Abdel Rehman al-Hussainan, who was also known as Abu Zaid al-Kuwaiti, was killed when missiles slammed into a house in Pakistan’s tribal region of North Waziristan, near the Afghan border. Al-Kuwaiti appeared in many videos released by Al Qaeda, and was presented as a religious scholar for the militant Islamic group. Death from above: The second in command of Al Qaeda, Abu Zaid al-Kuwaiti, was killed in a drone strike . He had formally replaced Abu Yahya al-Libi, Al Qaeda’s second in command, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in North Waziristan in June. Al-Kuwaiti appeared to be a less prominent figure than al-Libi, and less of a military commander. His role was more as a scholar developing the group’s ideology and training jihadists. But his death leaves a large hole at the top of the organisation, which has been headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri since the assassination of Osama bin Laden by US special forces last year. Covert CIA drone strikes have killed a series of senior Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in Pakistan’s tribal region over the past few years. But the attacks are controversial because the secret nature of the program makes it difficult to determine how many civilians are being killed. The second-in-command died when missiles hit his house in the region of North Waziristan near the Afghan border (pictured) Pakistani officials often criticize . the strikes as a violation of the country’s sovereignty, which has . helped make them extremely unpopular in the country. But senior . Pakistani officials are also known to have cooperated with strikes in . the past. Al-Kuwaiti’s wife . and daughter were wounded in Thursday’s drone attack, according to . Pakistani intelligence officials. His wife died a day later at a . hospital. Al-Kuwaiti was buried in Tappi village in North Waziristan on Friday, the officials said. A Pakistani Taliban commander in the area told the Associated Press that local fighters were ‘very aggrieved’ and that they had lost a ‘big leader’. Many analysts believe the biggest threat now comes from Al Qaeda franchises in places like Yemen and Somalia rather than the traditional base of Afghanistan and Pakistan.","Abu Zaid al-Kuwaiti killed in Pakistan's tribal region of North Waziristan .

Moseman, a retired electrical contractor, started off with just a wooden stove when he started his collection about 20 years ago. But within 10 years, he had built a collection of hundreds of store items. Colorful: The shelves of Roy Moseman's basement are filled with an incredible array of bright tobacco tins, with long-gone names such as Q-Boid, Queed and Holiday Pipe Mixture . 'I just started buying it up,' said the decorated Vietnam veteran, who was wounded while serving on a river boat. Now, it's all displayed on shelves, counters and cabinets, which also date from many years ago. The shelves and boxes hold a dizzying array of tobacco packs of long-gone brands like Hi-Plane, Prince Albert, Q-Boid, Dixie Queen and Cherokee. There's a curious snuff ball made by Levi Garrett just down the shelf from tins of Possum Cigars. 'Am Good and Sweet,' the slogan says. Comprehensive: Moseman has hoarded a wide range of general store items . 'Graphic art': Moseman says he likes the advertising on the packaging . On the medicine shelves, Moseman's got Dr. Thracher's Mixture for Diarrhoea Due to Dietary Indiscretions near the section containing Hopalong Cassidy Hair Trainer, along with dozens of other products from Castor Oil to toothache drops. There's even a veterinary medicine section, featuring products such as Dr. LeGear's Poultry Inhalant. Nearby are tin and paper containers that once held such scary-sounding stuff as Mexican Brand Insect Fluid and El Vampiro. Moseman didn't neglect food and drink as he built his store collection. One unopened box contains Kate Smith's Bake-a-Cake Kit, just 31 cents. Veteran: Moseman served in Vietnam . Dedication: Moseman has built up his collection over the last two decades . 'I've even got a case of kite string down there,' he said. A tin sign celebrates a product once made here in Athens. 'Ice Cold Bludwine, for your health's sake,' just 5 cents a bottle. Most of the items in the collection aren't worth much on the collector's market, thanks in part to Internet shopping. But a few, like his Wrigley chewing gum man, are pretty rare, he said. Proud: Moseman shows off his basement . But Moseman built the collection mainly because these products are a kind of history in and of themselves. 'That's the thing I like; the graphic art,' said Moseman, pointing to an old wooden cabinet with a colorful lithograph on the front proclaiming 'It's Easy to Dye with Diamond Dyes.' Companies weren't spending money on TV, radio or Internet advertising 100 years ago, Moseman said. 'Their advertising is basically on their tins and boxes.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 04:40 EST, 10 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 10 December 2012 . When archaeologists unearthed the well-preserved tomb of a second-century Roman general that had lain under muddy clay for 1800 years, their find was hailed as the most important ancient Roman monument to come to light for decades. The burial place of Marcus Nonius Macrinus, the general who advised Emperor Marcus Aurelius and fought Germanic tribes in the second century, was found at Saxa Rubra, north of Rome, in 2008, and boasted marble pillars and Latin inscriptions. But despite the joy of historians who pored over the important ancient mausoleum, Italian authorities say it may now have to be reburied as they cannot afford the preservation works necessary to keep it open. Beautifully preserved: The tomb of Marcus Nonius Macrinus lay under thick clay for nearly 2000 years before being excavated in 2008 . Austerity measures mean cash for maintaining Italy's archaeological sites has been cut by 20 per cent since 2010, which means that unless a sponsor comes forward soon with the €2-3m (£1.6m-£2.4m) needed to preserve the ancient tomb, it will have to be be covered up. 'It is a painful choice but we cannot risk losing the monument,' Mariarosaria Barbera, Rome's archaeological superintendent, told the daily La Repubblica. 'The marbles can't face another winter [so] we must bury the site in order to preserve it.' Unlike Russell Crowe's character Maximus Decidus Meridius, Macrinus died a rich man after a long and successful career, and his extravagant tomb bears testament to that. With marble roof tiles, a panel carved with Latin script detailing his military career, which included a visit to Spain, and perfectly preserved carvings and friezes, the monument has lain under the thick clay of the nearby river Tiber, which has helped it stay in such good condition. Since it has been opened up, however, cracks have appeared in the stonework and the delicate letterwork has been discoloured by air pollution. 'The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor': Russell Crowe in the 2000 film, Gladiator . Darius Arya, an American . archaeologist who is campaigning to keep the monument open, said: 'This . is an extraordinary site, it blows you away. 'Burying these remains is a disaster - you wonder what is the point of archaeology.' Maria Grazia Vernuccio, of the heritage group Italia Nostra, told The Observer that cuts were threatening the condition of many historical sites including Pompeii and Villa Jovis, Emperor Tiberius' palace on Capri. She said: 'Over 40 per cent of Italy's archaeological sites are now closed due to lack of funds.  Inspectors often cannot even get to the more remote sites in their cars because the ministry won't give them petrol and there is less money for guards to keep looters out.' Macrinus' tomb, which lies close to the ancient Via Flaminia which linked Rome to the Adriatic sea on the east coast, was attacked by looters shortly after it was uncovered in 2008.  However the thieves were unable to carry the heavy piece of marble they wanted, and had to dump it nearby. As winter approaches, the filling-in work may begin any day soon. Daniela Rossi, the archaeologist who led the dig, said: 'There are more mausoleums waiting to be revealed along this stretch of the Via Flaminia.  It's a gold mine we may never get to see.' Marcus Nonius Macrinus was born in Brescia, northern Italy . Born to a distinguished local family, Macrinus became a senator at around 25 and a consul 16 years later in around 154AD . Macrinus was a general and consul who led campaigns for Marcus Aurelius from 161AD to 180AD . He fought numerous battles against adversaries including the Germanic Quadi and Marcomanni tribes who invaded Italy . He became one of the Emperor's favourites and part of his inner circle, serving as proconsul in Asia .","Burial place of Marcus Nonius Macrinus was found near river Tiber in 2008 .

Britain's biggest police force wants to change the way crime is reported by getting rid of front desks in police stations and opening police counters in places such as Costa Coffee instead. The Metropolitan Police Force is planning to axe 65 police counters in stations in London and replace them with high street contact points in coffee shops, faith centres and football stadiums. A Costa coffee shop in Highgate, North London, has been designated for a . reporting counter, and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club has been earmarked for desk space, The Times reported. Coffee and crime: A Costa coffee shop in Highgate, North London, has been designated for a reporting counter . The proposals will be forwarded to Boris . Johnson (left), Mayor of London, and Stephen Greenhalgh (right), his . deputy for policing, next month . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We are considering replacing 65 under-used front counters across London . with over 200 new contact points - either part of our estate, shared . with partners or other public places - which would increase the amount . of face-to-face contact we have with the public.' Critics of the plan said it alienated victims who would be less inclined to report the crime, particularly crimes such as rape,  if they had to do so in the company of the coffee-drinking public. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, told The Times: . 'Going into a police station is often the last thing people want to do: . they are often under emotional strain. This is not the environment in . which you expect victims to be sharing the space with people drinking . lattes. It’s a serious public service that requires serious public . premises.' The proposals have been under consideration by Met chiefs for the last six weeks and will be forwarded to Boris Johnson and the Mayor of London, and Stephen Greenhalgh, his deputy for policing next month. It is hoped the proposals, along with the sale of Scotland Yard headquarter in Westminster will help the Met achieve its £500 million budget cuts target. The plan to set up a replacement counter in the predominantly Jewish area of Golders Green, North London, on Fridays and Saturdays has been labelled 'culturally insensitive' by Andrew Dinsmore, the London Assembly member for Barnet, bearing in mind the Jewish holy day begins on Friday evening and ends on Saturday evening. Budget targets: It is hoped the proposals, along with the sale of Scotland Yard . headquarter in Westminster will help the Met achieve its £500 million . budget cuts target . The Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We are reviewing our front . counter services at police stations to see how effectively these . services are used. 'We have looked closely at how many and . what types of crime are reported in person at police stations, which . will help inform any decisions to alter opening hours or close front . counters whilst being there where victims need us. 'Public . access to policing services has changed considerably in recent years. The introduction of the 101 non-emergency number and our ability to . diary appointments for members of the public, coupled with internet . access, means greater flexibility to access our services. 'At . least one police station per borough will provide access for the public . 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

A mother whose daughter was strangled to death by her wealthy ex-boyfriend has revealed how she tormented the killer with handwritten cards in a bid to get him to speak about what he had done. Deborah Edwards found her daughter, 32-year-old Dana Clair, in a pool of blood in her luxury San Antonio, Texas apartment after she was murdered in the early hours of New Year's Day, 2009. More than two years later, Dana Clair's ex-boyfriend, Thomas Ford, was found guilty of strangling her and beating her beloved pet dog to death after he was unable to deal with their break up. Speaking with 48 Hours Mystery, which recounted the often troubled investigation in a special episode,  Mrs Edwards revealed how she tormented Ford for the months leading up to his trial. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Dana Clair Edwards, right, was found strangled in her apartment in January 2009, three months after breaking up with Thomas Ford, left, who was found guilty of her murder . On February 14, 2009, while Ford remained a free man, Mrs Edwards sent him a Valentine's Day card, with the words: 'I'm thinking of you.' 'I wanted him to know I was thinking about him and that he needed to think about me,' she said. Another card read: 'Mother's Day - Never the same', while an email sent from her daughter's account read: 'How long were you planning this murder?' 'Remember how you ended her life' another card read, with a photo enclosed, with the words: 'Happy New Year. Dana Clair as a child.' In the 2011 trial of Edwards, in which . he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison, defense attorneys . attacked her for what they branded 'harassment' - but she stood by her . actions. Heartbroken: Her mother, Deborah, sent Ford a series of cards 'harassing' him after the murder . Unrelenting: She sent cards on special occasions 'so he knew I was thinking about him', she said . Demanding: Other messages were more direct, such as this email sent from Dana Clair's account . 'What does a mother do when she's seen her daughter laying in a pool of blood?' she said. She sent the letters as investigators and prosecutors began building their case against Ford, 43, who had dated Dana Clair for two-and-a-half years before she broke up with him in October 2008. Following the break up, Ford, a well-educated man from one of the area's 'best' families, sent her letters describing his heartbreak and how he was unable to sleep. 'I need you to know that I am deeply . saddened, hurt and disappointed at the sudden termination of our . relationship,' he wrote on a card, dated October 1, 2008, shown at the trial. 'I just lie in bed crying over this . tremendous loss and loneliness I now feel... I wish you would . reconsider... You are the person I want to spend the rest of my life . with and raise a family with!' Killed: Two weeks after her death, her beloved dog Grits (pictured) was found killed and dumped in a field . Just before Christmas, Ford asked . Dana Clair to his house to talk about the break up. Mrs Edwards explained: 'She told me that it had been a really . hard meeting. He was going on and on and crying and she was worried and . she said, ""Finally, I just had to leave, mother"".' But the two shared the same circle of friends and went to the same New Year's Eve party, although Ford left before midnight and claimed he was heading home. His early departure came after he had been left upset by a game of word association, where two of Dana Clair's friends teased him after he was given the word 'marriage', they said at the trial. Dana Clair left after midnight and returned to her condo complex. Scene: She was found by her mother face down on the bathroom floor, pictured, in a pool of blood . But after she failed to pick up her . family's dozens of calls on New Year's Day, they went to her apartment . and found her lifeless body face down in the bathroom, with a towel over her . head. Arrest: Her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Ford, denied the murder but phone records placed him at the scene . 'I opened the door and I yelled for Dana and there was no sound back and no dogs,' her father Darrell said. 'She was lying on the bathroom floor in a big pool of blood. And I felt her leg and it was cold.' Her mother added: 'I kneeled on the floor next to her and pushed the towel off . of her head and looked at her beautiful green eyes. I have no idea . how long I was there. It was 'til the police made me get up and leave.' Yet authorities initially believed she had slipped in the bathroom and ruled it accidental - until the autopsy found the cause of death was ligature strangulation. Her apartment showed no signs of a robbery but a rolled up carpet, scattered belongings and smeared blood also raised alarm bells. 'When I heard, I just knew it had been . deeply personal just because of the way the killing was perpetrated,' Dana Clair's friend, Cornelia Sawatzky, told 48 Hours. Police turned to her heartbroken . ex-boyfriend, who denied he had anything to do with the death and said . he had immediately gone home to bed after the party. But . grainy surveillance footage outside her condo complex filmed a white . truck - like that belonging to Ford - waiting outside the building in . the early hours of January 1. Footage also caught a person walking into her building after she arrived home. In court: Ford, 43, was found guilty of the murder in 2011 and sentenced to 40 years in prison . Cell phone records also showed that, when he received calls that night, signal bounced off towers near her home, rather than his own, and placed him at the scene for more than an hour-and-a-half. Records taken later that morning placed him two miles from her apartment, where Dana Clair's murdered Jack Russell dog, Grits, was found two weeks after her death. Two of Dana Clair's friends also claimed they had gone to Ford's home after the party to drop off a beer cooler he had left behind, but did not see his car in his driveway. And DNA on the towel also matched Ford's - yet his attorneys argued that he had been at the apartment as recently as 10 days before her death, so his DNA would be on her belongings. It was not the only troublesome piece of evidence in the case. Investigators lost her fingernail clippings and the underwear she was wearing when . she was killed. Loved: Dana Clair Edwards' family remembered her as a loving sister and daughter committed to her pets . Breakdown: Ford had written her begging letters after she broke up with him after more than two years . They also misplaced clearer surveillance footage and instead had to rely on the grainier images, which did not even make the gender of the figure clear. 'There were . points in the case that we were despairing, that we were depressed,' prosecutor Kirsta Melton said. 'We knew he did it... My biggest fear was that justice might not be done here.' But at trial, Ford was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 40 years in prison. 'I guess what was a little bit of . amazing was I could feel all my daughter's good memories come back to me . without Thomas in all of that,' Mrs Edwards said. 'I felt like I had her back.' Thomas Ford is appealing his conviction. He will be eligible for parole in 20 years. And for now, all her family can do is mourn the loss of the caring animal lover, sister and daughter. 'She was just always full of . life and love,' Dana Clair's brother, DJ, said. 'The . ultimate American girl.'

An unexpected new proposal put forward by Arab states to create sweeping governmental powers to regulate the Internet today raised fears of an expansion of online censorship.

A leaked draft of the Russia-led . proposals would block some Internet locations and wrest control of allotting web addresses from a U.S.-based body. It could allow governments to render . websites within their borders inaccessible, even via proxy servers, and create multinational pacts in which . countries could terminate access to websites at each others' request. A controversial proposal for a new treaty which would give countries more powers to block websites and monitor emails has been put forward by a group of Arab states at a global conference in Dubai (above) The coalition also wants the new treaty to . include measures to combat spam email, but its definition of spam is so . broad that it could be applied to almost any emailed message. That would provide a pretext for . authoritarian regimes to suppress opponents, critics warn. Russia and its supporters, which include many African and Arab states, seek to formally extend the remit of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to govern many aspects of the Internet. But the United States, Europe and other allies including Australia and Japan insist the treaty should continue to apply only to traditional telecommunications such as international wireline and wireless calls. The proposals have caused a deep rift between the 193 nations at the conference as the West is calling for lighter regulation of the internet . Countries can opt out of parts of the revised treaty when it emerges or refuse to sign it altogether. 'If we have no agreement it will create political tension around the Internet,' said Markus Kummer, vice president for public policy at industry think tank The Internet Society. A leaked draft of the Russia-led proposals would give countries 'equal rights to manage the Internet including in regard to the allotment, assignment and reclamation of Internet numbering.' Such moves would undermine ICANN, a self-governing, non-profit organisation under contract to the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is ultimately responsible for making sure that people trying to reach a given website actually get there. 'Much of the Internet was developed from U.S. research funding, and the U.S. has kept a residual role, so many other governments say it's not right that one government 'controls' the Internet,' said Kummer. 'The irony is the U.S. has a very laid-back role and protects the Internet from political interference, but the fact it's the U.S. makes it highly political.' Markus Kummer, vice-president of The Internet Society . Rod Beckstrom, until recently the chief executive of ICANN, which currently sits atop the addressing system, said: 'The reason some countries want to create national control over addresses is so they can have another point of control.' Decentralising the process could prove chaotic if many countries demand that companies use only their national system. Beyond web locations and addresses, the Russia-led coalition document says ITU member states should be able to control other elements of the Internet's infrastructure within their borders, as Russia has sought for months. The revision would give nations the explicit right to 'implement policy' on net governance and 'regulate the national Internet segment,' the draft says. 'If you throw in addressing and naming, that puts the entire ecosystem in play, which is what the U.S. and E.U. said they would never agree to,' said a Western participant at the conference who asked not to be named to maintain his ability to negotiate. 'You're almost guaranteeing lock-up in certain areas that might prevent the other areas from easily going forward,' he said. The coalition wants the new treaty to include measures to combat spam email, but critics fear that would encourage authoritarian regimes to suppress opponents, while also doing little to solve what is a technical problem. Another clause states any country should have the right to know the route of telecom traffic 'where technically feasible,' which differs from an earlier submission and appears to acknowledge tracing Internet traffic is impractical. 'Internet networks don't follow national borders and a lot of governments are not happy with that notion, that they don't have control over their territory,' said Kummer. 'Some governments feel threatened, which they see as undermining their national sovereignty.' Egypt was named as a co-author of the Russia-led submission, but on Sunday it disavowed the document in what may be a sign of cracks emerging in the loose anti-U.S. coalition. 'Our name was associated to this proposal by mere misunderstanding,' Nashwa Gad, a department manager at Egypt's Ministry of Communications & Information Technology (MCIT), said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 'Egypt has always been supporting the basic Internet principles that ... the Internet should remain free, open, liberal. We do not see that the ITU mandate deals with the Internet.' The United States has made a counterproposal co-signed by Canada that would stop the treaty being applied to Internet companies such as Google or government and business networks. It say increasing the treaty's scope could provide a platform for governments to stifle free speech, reduce online anonymity and censor Internet content. But Russia and its supporters argue they need new powers to able to fight cyber crime and protect networks. After six days of largely private talks, very little seems to have been agreed, with the main plenary committee meeting on Monday to again consider the U.S.-Canada proposal among others. The ITU usually agrees decisions by consensus, but the intransigence of both sides means it could come down to a vote, which may leave the United States and its allies in the minority. 'The U.S. is not considering walking out of the conference and is still participating as normal,' a U.S. spokesman said in an emailed statement, denying an earlier report that the United States could quit the summit, which ends on Friday.","Russia, Saudi Arabia and UAE among countries which signed have controversial new plan .

Now they have celebrated their 90th birthday in the house they still share together. Timeless twins: Albert and Fred Trethewey live together and have just celebrated their 90th birthday . Albert said: ‘We're plodding along like we always have, doing the same things, watching the football. ‘There's . really very little difference between us. We're been watching one . another's back for 90 years but that's what twins are for.’ Fred added: ‘We are lucky to have each other, it's a lovely thing, we never feel lonely.’ The brothers, from Torpoint in Cornwall, were born 45 minutes apart on December 4, 1922, to parents Emmie and James. Growing up they had the same interests. Albert said: ‘We were both into football . and chasing the females. And if you ever got into a fight you always . knew there was someone coming to help you out.’ Now and then: The inseparable duo remain as close now as they were aged 14 (left) when they took turns to play right midfield in the football team at the school they went to together .

RAF Coastal Command at Cornwall's RAF St Eval, a Second World War . airbase that provided anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols off the . south west coast of Britain. The base was heavily bombed by the . Luftwaffe while the twins were stationed there but they survived and . went on to see service further afield in North Africa, Singapore, and . cities including Bombay and Karachi, where they struggled with the harsh . climate.

Millions of E.on customers face an increase of more than £100 a year in energy bills after it announced a rise in tariffs. The company, which will put up prices from January 18, is the last of the ‘big six’ suppliers to hit customers with an increase. E.on blamed higher wholesale prices, coupled with the cost of cutting the nation’s carbon emissions through a shift to green energy. It also pointed to Government policy which requires companies to add money to bills to fund the installation of free insulation for elderly and vulnerable customers. Prices are on the move: E.on is the last of the 'big six' energy suppliers to put their prices up . The German-owned firm is putting up gas by 9.4 per cent and electricity . by 7.7 per cent, which will squeeze the cost of living for some . 4.8million customers. Families who have a dual fuel contract will pay an . extra 8.7 per cent – £103 a year, with the average annual bill rising . to £1,263. Director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, Ann Robinson, said: ‘As winter temperatures plummet, consumers could buckle under the strain of higher energy prices. ‘This winter almost nine in ten households are expected to ration their energy use to save on bills.’ Heating up: Price rises had been expected at the gas and electricity supplier after it said there would be no increase before the end of the year . A graph showing a breakdown of E.on energy costs rises . 'The fact is that high energy prices have a big impact on consumers and leave many unable to turn on their heating for fear of running up a large bill.’ Director of energy at the official customer body, Consumer Focus, Audrey Gallacher, said consumers doubt whether the recent industry price rises are justified. She warned: ‘Higher energy prices will be, yet again, the greatest concern for many households this winter. ‘Bill payers need to know that wholesale prices and other costs have increased enough to justify these rises. As it stands the pressures on price are just too opaque and contested to provide confidence.’ E.on was the last of the six big energy firms to announce its price increase: . E.on made clear that government policy and its pressure to support wind, solar and other low carbon sources for electricity is driving up bills. It said the cost of renewable energy schemes, building new networks of pylons to connect wind farms to the national grind and funding social schemes to insulate homes is rising fast. E.on chief executive, Tony Cocker, said: ‘We have held back from increasing our prices for as long as we possibly could and at the same time have worked hard to reduce our own costs as a business so that our customers can get the best price possible.’ He insisted the company’s profit margin of around two per cent last year was fair. But he said, ‘Unfortunately the other costs which make up energy bills are rising. ‘The price we pay for energy on the national and global wholesale markets is higher than it was and next year the Government’s Carbon Price Floor will add another charge to electricity bills which we and others regard as simply a tax. ‘Network costs are rising too. These are the prices we pay to other companies to use the wires and pipes which transport the energy to your home, which are now more than 10per cent higher than last year and are expected to climb higher still in 2013. ‘The cost of the Government’s social schemes, which often focus on providing subsidised or free insulation, have more than doubled in the last 12 months and another increase is expected next year too. ‘Finally, the cost of increasing the amount of energy we get from renewable sources such as wind farms, has risen by over 60 per cent when compared with last year. As with the other costs, this is expected to rise in 2013 too.’ Mr Cocker said while energy firms are under fire for their role, Government ministers also need to explain how their decisions are driving up bills.","German-owned supplier will put gas and electricity prices up on January 18 .

David Cameron today revealed how the rough and tumble of life in politics had not prepared him for the onslaught of abuse from Twitter trolls, telling him to lose weight and wishing he was dead. The Prime Minister said he had been stunned by the stream of vitriol which every message on the site attracted – though he let slip it is not always him typ[ing the 140 characters. As Tory leader in 2009 he declared on live radio that he would not join Twitter, warning: ‘Too many tweets might make a t***.’ David Cameron revealed how an apparently innocuous picture of him talking on the telephone to Barack Obama attracted an angry response about his weight . But this autumn the PM announced he would be making a foray into the Twittersphere, promising an ‘edgier’ outlook than the official Number 10 account which is monitored by civil servants. Nothing Mr Cameron has posted since has come close to the bitter response from other users to his @David_Cameron account. ‘You get a lot of abuse in politics, I don’t mind that, but you have to get used to trolls,’ Mr Cameron told a lunch for journalists in Parliament. ‘Trolls are my new favourite things. I have had some very good things.’ However, he admitted that aides are more likely to be posting to the account than himself. Last month a photograph was released on the account of him talking on the telephone, apparently to US President Barack Obama. ‘I tweeted the other day, apparently – . or someone tweeted on my behalf – I tweeted the other day about that . picture of me talking to Barack Obama, celebrating the special . relationship and his re-election. ‘And a particularly unpleasant troll . tweeted back: “Nevermind the special relationship…looks like you’d do . better on the Special K diet.” News of a royal baby was not enough to stop one of the PM's trolls from wishing he was dead . He also revealed that an apparently . harmless message responding to the news that Prince William and Kate . were expecting a baby had been seized on by trolls. Here is a selection of some of the comments which @David_Cameron was bombarded with soon after starting his account: . ‏@Gaslef mornin dave, what atrocities are you planning to inflict on the working classes today then? #toriesruiningthenation . ‏@Codeine74 Hello Dave, this is your daily reminder that thousands of Britain's most vulnerable people are suffering more thanks to you. @thisisamy_ . I am seriously angry by @David_Cameron 's comments. Stop LYING & . pretending you're helping the poor & vulnerable. You do not care one . bit. @Chad_C_Mulligan Yawn. Another super-shiny PR opportunity. Why aren't your sleeves rolled up, Dave? ‏@Bethemediauk I thought you said you wouldn't tweet much. That's 7 now. 7 too many. ‘I tweeted that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would make wonderful parents, and the troll rapidly tweeted back “and you’d make a wonderful corpse”. This is what happens on Twitter.’ The Prime Minister did not appear to regret his u-turn after ruling out joining Twitter, saying it had added to an ‘interesting year’ for me. Media watchdog Ofcom cleared Absolute Radio of breaching broadcasting regulations despite 20 complaints from listeners after Mr Cameron’s foul-mouthed outburst on the Christian O’Connell breakfast show in 2009. ‘The adjudication from Ofcom is on the wall in Number 10 Downing Street,’ he said today. When someone joked it was hanging in ‘the loo’, the PM replied: ‘No, it’s in the hallway it’s a beautiful thing between two people.’ Mr Cameron also revealed that he did not watch . suspended Conservative MP Nadine Dorries on TV reality show I'm a . Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, but said that he would be 'tempted' to . vote for Boris Johnson to undergo a bushtucker trial if the London . Mayor ever went onto the ITV show. But the PM appeared to blunder when he claimed to have voted for Will Young to win the X Factor on the orders of his daughter Nancy. However, Young won the first series of Pop Idol in 2002 - two years before Nancy's birth in 2004. Mr Cameron also revealed that he once had a 'fantastic conversation' trying to explain I'm A Celebrity to Margaret Thatcher, when the former Prime Minister's daughter Carol was a . contestant in 2005. With millions of people – and potential voters – on Twitter, the lure of the site became too strong to resist for the PM. Ahead of the Tory party conference in October, Mr Cameron announced his arrival on the site with a . reference to his 2009 warning: ‘I'm starting Conference with this new . Twitter feed about my role as Conservative Leader. I promise there won't . be ""too many tweets...’ Before the account was set up aides . promised it would be an ‘edgy’ and ‘more political’ outlet for the Prime . Minister to target voters. One of the first pictures Mr Cameron posted on his Twitter account featured a caterpillar birthday cake presented to him by his staff . To . date it has been rather more sedate, consisting of posts praising . speeches by colleagues, alerting people to imminent TV appearances and . photos of charity work. Mr Cameron was the 370th MP to start an account. Within . 12 hours the account had 75,000 followers but bookmakers Ladbrokes were . offering odds of 25/1 that he would reach 100,000 before the Tory . conference in Birmingham closed.

Researchers have observed the brightest flare-up yet seen from the black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy. As supermassive black holes go, Sagittarius A* is relatively quiet, giving off roughly as much energy as the sun - in spite of the fact it is some 4billion times as big. About once a day, however, it emits a burst of light - a phenomenon scientists have been keen to investigate to get a better understanding of how black holes evolve. Supermassive: This false-color image shows the central region of our Milky Way Galaxy as seen by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, with a flare from the Sagittarius A* black hole visible as a bright, point-like source at the centre of the image . Now an international team using Nasa's Chandra X-Ray Observatory have detected the brightest flare yet observed from Sagittarius A*, which for an hour glowed some 150 times brighter than the black hole's usual luminosity. They say the brief burst of activity may offer a vital clue about how mature black holes behave. Joey Neilsen, postdoctoral associate at MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, told MITnews: 'We’re learning what black holes do when they’re old. 'They’re no young whippersnappers like quasars, but they’re still active, and how they’re active is an interesting question.' As black holes swallow nearby matter, they emit light energy which allows astronomers to detect them. However, while the centres of newborn galaxies and quasars spew huge amounts of energy as they devour matter around them, older black holes tend to slow down as they age, consuming less and appearing fainter. Brief: This animation shows the unexplained hour-long burst of light detected emanating from Sagittarius A* in February which scientists say could offer clues as to how supermassive black holes evolve . An influential astrophysicist hired by DC Comics to pinpoint the location of Superman’s home planet, Krypton, has done just that. The fictional planet Krypton would have orbited a red dwarf star called LHS 2520, says Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium in New York City. The star is 27.1 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Corvus, also known as ‘The Crow’, says Dr. Tyson. The star is cooler and smaller than our sun. ‘This is a major milestone in the Superman mythos that gives our super hero a place in the universe,’ DC Entertainment co-publisher Dan DiDio said in a company statement. ‘Having Neil deGrasse Tyson in the book was one thing, but by applying real-world science to this story he has forever changed Superman’s place in history,’ he said. ‘Now fans will be able to look up at the night’s sky and say, “That’s where Superman was born”.’ While the popular idea of black holes . is like a vacuum sucking up everything that drifts by, Frederick K. Baganoff, a research scientist explains that 'in this really . low-accretion-rate state they’re really finicky eaters, and for some . reason they actually blow away most of the energy.' However, . an analysis of Sagittarius A* made by Chandra' High Energy Transmission . Gratings Spectrometer on February 9 showed a spike of 700 photons - 150 . times brighter than its usual luminosity. 'Suddenly, for whatever reason, Sagittarius A* is eating a lot more,' said MIT Kavli research scientist Michael Nowak. 'One theory is that every so often, an asteroid gets close to the black hole, the black hole stretches and rips it to pieces, and eats the material and turns it into radiation, so you see these big flares.' Dr Nowak told MITnews that he suspects such flare-ups occur more frequently than scientists had previously thought and the team have now reserved more than a month on Chandra to observe Sagittarius A* in the hopes of detecting more and finding out what is causing them. Another question the team hopes to investigate is why the black hole gives off so little energy. Dr Baganoff in 2003 calculated that given the amount of gas surrounding it, Sagittarius A* should be a million times brighter. His findings suggested that the black hole is actually throwing away most of the matter that floats into its gravitational pull - the physics of which remains a puzzle that could explain the history of our galaxy.","Flare up measured at 150 times the usual luminosity of Sagittarius A* .

A husband shot and killed his Transportation Security Administration official wife before turning the gun on himself in an apparent murder-suicide, authorities said today. Officials said that the TSA agent, 20, was being followed by her estranged husband, 28, who tailed her into a remote parking lot for the Cleveland-Hopkins International airport. Police said that the husband followed her into the parking lot, slammed her car with his, then fired five shots at her. Horror: A TSA officer was fatally shot by her husband Sunday before he killed himself on an off-site parking lot at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, pictured . The Riveredge Parking Lot is far away from the passenger area of the busy Ohio airport, and is located off of Interstate 480. The husband fired at a second TSA employee who had been riding with his wife but missed, police spokesman Sgt. Sammy Morris said. The late morning shooting at an airport employee parking lot was an apparent homicide and suicide, Morris added. No names were immediately released. The 20-year-old woman was rushed to MetroHealth Medical Center, where she died, according to fox8.com. The husband was pronounced dead at the scene. Occupation: The woman, 20, worked as a TSA agent at the busy Ohio airport and was carpooling with a coworker at the time she was shot (file photo) A woman who witnessed the shooting told Fox 8 that she confronted the gunman after the shooting. ‘I’m happy to be alive,’ she said, adding that she told the gunman that she called the police after witnessing him shoot his wife. Officials said the husband and wife were estranged, but investigators weren't sure of a motive for the shooting.

'Shooting spree': Hector Ceyala is accused of shooting three people dead in California . Hector Celaya, suspected of  fatally shooting three people and wounding his two daughters and one other child, has died of wounds sustained in a gunfight with police. Celaya, 31, allegedly shot and . wounded his two daughters, aged five and eight, who were with him in a vehicle as he fled across California Indian reservation where he was caught at 2am, officials said. It was unclear when the girls were shot. A motive for the attacks was not immediately known. Authorities . apprehended Ceyala about six hours after Tulare County sheriff's . deputies were called at 8pm on Saturday, to a trailer on the Tule Indian . Reservation. Inside the home, they found the body of a man and a woman; the body of another man was discovered in a nearby shed. Deputies . also discovered a boy, believed to be about seven, wounded. He was . taken to a hospital in Visalia, then on to a second hospital in Fresno, . said Shelby Charley Jr., an engineer and supervisor with the Tule River . Reservation Fire Department. 'This . is a once in a lifetime kind of deal,' Mr Charley said of the call. 'It's one of those calls you could go your whole career and not walk . into. This is one of those calls that will stick with you for the rest . of your life.' Police . tracked Celaya's cellphone and pulled him over in a rural area outside . the tiny community of Lindsay at 2 am, about 20 miles from the . reservation. Celaya fired his weapon, prompting deputies to return fire, sheriff's Sgt. Chris Douglass said. She . did not say how many shots were fired but said Celaya fired his gun . 'multiple times'. Celaya was wounded during the exchange of gunfire and . was being treated for life-threatening injuries, Douglass said. Celaya also shot his daughters. One girl suffered life-threatening injuries while the other girl was less seriously hurt. Celaya . is described by authorities as 'known to law enforcement, is known to . use drugs,' though Douglass could not provide additional details. The reservation where the initial shooting took place is about 50 miles north of Bakersfield. Since the shootout more details have emerged about Celeya's background as the church bell that . rings out to announce the deaths of tribal members on the Tule River . Indian Reservation tolled four times Sunday. The . remote reservation relies on the Eagle Mountain Casino for revenues. Each tribal member receives $500 a month, but Hunter said most of the . profit is invested into educational programs for the children. The . compound where the shooting took place is on a dirt road in a scenic . canyon lined with oaks and sycamore trees. Herds of horses graze the . hillsides, and modular houses sit on hilltops. But tribal members said the former custodian at the . reservation's casino had a troubled past. 'He . had a real hard life,' said Rhoda Hunter, the tribal council secretary. 'But all of us do, we all have a hard time. But we try not to let it get . the best of us.' Hunter said that Celaya's . mother was a friend of hers. Her name has not yet been released by . authorities at the Tulare County sheriff's department, which is . investigating the case. The killings stunned the tightknit tribal community. 'We've had a lot of deaths here, but nothing like this. Not murder. No, not murder,' Hunter said.

"By . James Chapman and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 19:29 EST, 9 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:24 EST, 10 December 2012 . Chancellor George Osborne, who was out jogging in Westminster today, has defended the rise 1 per cent rise in benefits, saying welfare handouts had risen at twice the rate of wages . Liberal Democrats are to hold talks on voting against a cap on welfare rises, branding them a ‘horrible thing to do’. Backbench MPs claim they are ‘distressed’ that leader Nick Clegg signed up a below-inflation 1 per cent rise in benefits in each of the next three years. The Labour party is also suggesting it will try to block the move, which Chancellor George Osborne said was needed after benefits rose at twice the rate of average wages. The Coalition hopes to save £4.4billion a . year through the cap on working-age benefits announced last week by . Chancellor George Osborne. Tory sources say the amount is equal to 1p a . year on basic income tax. But some Lib Dem MPs are considering voting against the measure, and plan to voice their opposition this week. Cheltenham MP Martin Horwood attacked Tories who sound 'pleased' about cutting benefits. 'I mean they seem to be hitting some of the most vulnerable people in this country. 'The remaining real-terms cut in benefits is a very painful thing to swallow and it's a difficult thing for us to swallow politically but much more difficult for people to cope with who are actually struggling to live on a very small amount of money each week,' he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour. Asked if he would vote against the cap when legislation is drawn up in the new year, he replied: 'I . would like to talk to Liberal Democrat colleagues about this but I am . very unhappy about it. I'm not happy about some of the welfare cuts at . all.' Fellow Lib Dem MP Stephen Gilbert also said he was 'distressed' by the 1 per cent rise, and attacked 'loose language' from Tories who wanted to curb state handouts. Meanwhile Labour has given the clearest indication yet that it will block a cap on welfare handouts, saying that it will ‘struggle’ to support the plan. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna fears a below-inflation 1 per cent rise in benefits in each of the next three years will increase child poverty and harm lower-income families. ‘Unless fundamental changes are made to the proposals that we’ve seen so far I think we will struggle to support this,’ he said. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Labour would 'struggle' to support the cap unless changes are made . 'The Chancellor is seeking to set up a debate between the so-called strivers on the one hand and people in receipt of benefits on the other, whilst totally and wilfully ignoring the fact that many people who are on benefit are actually in work. 'Six out of ten households that are going to be affected by the cuts that have been announced this week are working households, so to set this up in this way is completely reprehensible because many people who are on benefits and working are striving.' The move will dismay the few Blairites left on Labour’s front line, because it risks suggesting to voters that the party is in denial over the need to cut the size of the welfare state. Free bus travel will be offered to  more than 800,000 unemployed people in an attempt to get them to find a jobs. Anyone who has been out of work for between three months and a year will be eligible for the Britain-wide scheme . Transport minister Norman Baker said: 'Good bus services play a huge role in boosting economic growth by helping people to access employment and training opportunities. 'I have been encouraging bus operators to look at the fare deals they can offer to young people looking for work, so I congratulate the operators that are doing so in January and look forward to seeing other offers in the future.' The scheme has been organised by a coalition of transport bodies. Claimants will need to hold a JobCentre Plus Travel Discount Card, which already entitles them to half-price journeys. Arriva, . First, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach are among the . operators signed up to the deal, which covers 70% of routes in England, . Wales and Scotland. The Government is to introduce a Bill to . enshrine the one per cent cap in law – forcing the Opposition into a corner over . whether to oppose limits in welfare which polls show are popular with . the public. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan . Smith will today tell MPs that three million families will be better off . by an average of £168 a month after multiple benefits are replaced by a . single, universal credit. The new system is designed to ensure it . always pays to take a job or work more hours. Under cuts outlined by Mr Osborne last week, working . age benefits will not rise in line with inflation - due to be 2.2 per . cent next year - but will be capped at one per cent for each of the next . three years. The Chancellor told MPs the changes . were needed because 'fairness is about being fair to the person who . leaves home every morning to go out to work and sees their neighbour . still asleep, living a life on benefits'. He said Jobseekers Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support and Housing Benefit would be affected. But the changes also affect maternity pay - with Labour dubbing the plans a 'Mummy Tax'. Business Secretary Vince Cable attacking the 'demonisation' of people on benefits. 'Given the country's now poorer than it was before the banks collapsed, we have a massive budget deficit, we've going to have to look at the welfare budget because it's rising so much up up in forms of public spending,' he told BBC Radio 5Live. 'So certainly we should look at it, but we shouldn't gloat over the misfortune of others. The majority of people who are affected by this are actually in work and I think what we should be talking about a bit more is he steps the Government has taken to lift the tax threshold for people who are in low pay and are in work - that goes some way to offset the pressures on them.' Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, a Lib Dem, denied the squeeze will hit lower-income working families. The Lib Dem MP said they would be more than compensated by other measures, including a rise in the basic-rate income tax threshold to £9,440. Officials said that overall the average working family would be £125 a year better off next year. In a YouGov survey yesterday, 52 per cent of voters backed the cap or said benefits should not rise at all, against 35 per cent who said the Government is wrong. In an email to party members, Mr Clegg sought to distance himself from the policy. The Lib Dem leader wrote: ‘We worked to limit the impact of the next wave of cuts on low income families, ruling out the abolition of child benefit for families with two or more children, and saying we should keep housing benefit for under-25s who need a place to stay. ‘The welfare savings are less than half of the £10 billion cuts first floated. They give people on benefits exactly the same rise as we are giving in pay to nurses, civil servants and everyone else in the public sector.’","Backbenchers Martin Horwood and Stephen Gilbert criticise plan to limit rises to one per cent for each of the next three years .

Elderly and disabled people who live in care homes are treated like ‘brutes or malfunctioning machines’, Booker Prize-winning novelist Hilary Mantel has warned. The Wolf Hall author, who was awarded a second Man Booker Prize in October for Bring Up The Bodies, said that even those in the best homes were talked down to by staff in ‘the doting tones we use with babies’. She made the comments after helping to find a care home place for a disabled friend who needed round-the-clock care. 'Depressing': The writer spoke out after helping to find a care home place for a disabled friend . ‘Nobody should place the whole blame on scarcity of resources,’ the 60-year-old said. ‘That would be too complacent. ‘All the money in the world cannot remedy failure of imagination.’ She told the Sunday Times Magazine it was not just cases where residents were ‘grossly violated’ that were important, adding: ‘With old age and disability it is the daily, unspectacular reality that poses a challenge.’ The novelist was horrified by the institutions she saw, which she said were either ‘excruciatingly expensive’ or ‘utterly depressing’. ‘We didn’t see anywhere dirty, but we saw places that were utterly depressing,’ she said. ‘Behind august frontages, Edwardian houses degenerated into tiny . passages, narrowed further by dumped food trolleys and filing cabinets. ‘Manicured gardens and coastal views – all costed out in the monthly bill – were accessible only to visitors and the spryest of residents, while those in wheelchairs could gaze at the wall,’ she said. 'Unspectacular reality': The author said care homes treated elderly and disabled people as 'brutes' or 'malfunctioning machines' (FILE PHOTO) In one home, they saw a 'wet room' containing a mop, bucket and . disinfectant. ‘This display said, plainly, ‘It would be easier if we . just hosed you down,’ ”’said Mantel. Mrs Mantel eventually found a home that seemed suitable but her friend was dealt with so appallingly that staff had to be reminded she was a ‘resident not a prisoner’. But the author, who worked in a geriatric hospital in the 1970s, admitted that standards were far higher now than in that era, when institutions were 'heart-rending'.","Writer claimed even those in the best homes are 'talked down to' by staff .

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge celebrated news of her pregnancy with a shepherd's pie and an early night, a friend claimed today. Former school friend Jessica Hay claimed the Royal couple discovered she was expecting at their small, three-bedroom cottage in Wales in October. She described it as 'the most nerve-racking moment of Kate's entire life'. But according to Jessica, there were no champagne corks popping. Instead, the pair tucked into a home-cooked traditional shepherd's pie and went to bed early. Baby joy: A former school friend of Kate Middleton has claimed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge learnt of her pregnancy at their small, three-bedroom cottage in Wales in October . In an exclusive interview with Australian magazine New Idea, Jessica also tells of the drama which unfolded when Kate fell ill and how the Royal couple's plan to announce their baby news at Christmas was blown. Jessica was completely correct when she first tipped the pregnancy, with a nod and a wink predicting a Christmas announcement, when she spoke exclusively to the magazine three weeks ago. Not even the Royal pair could have predicted what would happen next. The ecstatic Duchess was excited to share . the news with her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and the couple . visited them at the family cottage in the village of Bucklebury, . Berkshire. Kate was well and putting on weight. No champagne corks popping: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (pictured leaving hospital on Thursday after she was treated for severe morning sickness) celebrated news she was expecting with a shepherd's pie and an early night, the friend claimed . During a relaxing weekend, Wills and Kate were looking forward to some of Carole's cooking ahead of a busy Christmas when they planned to tell the world Kate was finally expecting. But on the Saturday morning, December 1, Kate became ill. Jessica, one of the Duchess's oldest friends, tells New Idea: 'She took to her bed for most of the weekend and on Monday morning, her mother and William told her she must get herself checked out by medics.' William insisted on driving Catherine himself, keeping things low-key but then Kate was admitted to the private King Edward VII Hospital. The good news, says Jessica, is that after her hospital ordeal, Kate is now feeling much better: 'I'm hearing she's already craving food again - she particularly wants papaya fruit and they're busy making plans for Christmas. 'She's already feeling much better and, as they do with everything, they're getting through the ordeal by making each other laugh.' Excited: The friend claimed the couple told the Duchess's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton (pictured left with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at the Royal wedding) about ten days ago . Although the Royal couple originally planned to make their announcement on December 24, Jessica says a great weight has been lifted from the pair's shoulders because they don't like keeping secrets: 'They're relieved everyone knows and they're just focused on getting her health firmly back on track.' One that speculation that the early pregnancy condition called hyperemesis gravidarum can be an indication of twins, Jessica says: 'Catherine would love twins and a lot of people in their circle in London say it could indeed be the case that she is expecting twins. 'If it were a boy and a girl, it would be a dream come true for them both.' However, she reveals that Wills and Kate have told doctors they don't want to know the sex and have not been buying any baby clothes yet, either. They are keeping with tradition and want to find out when he or she arrives. Jessica's tip for a girl's name for their summer baby is Diana: 'Funnily enough, Diana is a name Catherine has always loved.' Victoria is another favourite. But Jessica says that Catherine is following her mother's suggestion that she should meet the baby first and then decide on a name. And the duchess will be a hands-on mum, with very few nannies: 'There will be a house with a lot of laughter rather than staffed with nannies, governesses and butlers and so on.' Jessica claimed the Royals learnt of the pregnancy after using a simple High Street testing kit which would have revealed the thin blue line the couple had been praying for.","Royals learnt of pregnancy at their Welsh cottage in October, according to one of the Duchess's oldest friends .

China is poised to make its largest purchase of a U.S. company yet. The American insurer AIG said on Sunday said it will sell up to 90 percent of its airplane leasing unit, International Lease Finance Corporation, to a Chinese investor group for approximately $5.28 billion. This deal is significantly larger than the $3 billion purchase of a stake in Blackstone Group by China Investment Corporation in 2007. Big business: AIG have sold 90 percent of their plane leasing unit to a Chinese consortium . U.S. regulatory approval is needed. AIG said the agreement had been submitted to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. This agency investigates deals for any security concerns. The Chinese consortium is led by Weng Xianding, chairman of New China Trust Co. Ltd., and also includes China Aviation Industrial Fund and P3 Investments Ltd. The group will acquire 80.1 percent of ILFC for approximately $4.23 billion, with an option for an additional 9.9 percent stake. According to its website, ILFC is 'world's largest independent aircraft lessor measured by number of owned aircraft.' A plane over Hong Kong. A Chinese consortium is poised to acquire 90 percent of the market leader in aircraft leasing . The company has a portfolio of over . 1,000 owned or managed aircraft in more than 80 countries. In China ILFC . has a 30 percent market share and leases out more than 175 aircraft. If Chinese regulatory approval is obtained and the option is exercised, the investor group is expected to expand to include New China Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and an investment arm of ICBC International, a subsidiary of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013. AIG will keep at least 10 percent of the Los-Angeles-based company. ILFC will continue to operate out of Los Angeles and remain incorporated in the U.S. CEO Henri Courpron and President Frederick S. Cromer will continue to operate and manage the business. ILFC is headquartered in the top two floors of Constellation Place (formerly MGM Tower) in Century City, Los Angeles . In June, Courpron was docked $1 million in pay after acknowledging he had an inappropriate relationship with an unnamed employee that was 'contrary to AIG’s expectations of its officers.' The company currently employs about 560 people, including more than 450 people based in the U.S., and expects to hire additional U.S.-based staff to replace AIG-supported operations. AIG has said the jet-leasing business is a non-core asset. The company had previously planned to take the unit public. The insurer has been selling off parts of its business to raise money to pay back the $182 billion bailout that it received from the government during the financial crisis of 2008. It was the biggest of the government’s bailouts. The government, which earlier this year owned 77 percent of AIG stock, has been gradually selling its stake. As of Sept. 30, the U.S. owned just under 16 percent of AIG’s outstanding common stock, according to a regulatory filing. AIG announced it was in talks to sell to the Chinese investment group on Friday. Investors reacted by pushing AIG stock up 2.6 percent, 87 cents, to $34.13.

Jailed for assisting: Bernie Beddoe was jailed for four years after helping a woman wrap her boyfriend's body in tarpaulin and hide it in a wheelie bin . The man who helped a woman hide her boyfriend’s body in a wheelie bin after she killed him has been jailed for four years. Bernie Beddoe, 60, helped Karen Otmani, 42, wrap the body of Shaun Corey in layers of tarpaulin, put it into a plastic packing case before depositing it in a wheelie bin which she kept in her bedroom of her Forest Hill house for 11 days. Otmani drugged Mr Corey, 42, and then tied him to her bed at her home in south London, before either placing a plastic bag over his head or smothering him with a pillow on June 4 last year. Beddoe, who was caught after a footprint found on the tarpaulin wrapped around the body was identified as his, was cleared of murder but convicted of assisting an offender today. Otmani had been found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey in November and jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years. When police found Mr Corey, his body was so decomposed they could not establish a cause of death. Judge Gerald Gordon told Beddoe, of Brockley, south London at Old Bailey: 'There can be no doubt that with your assistance the body was concealed and remained concealed for a total of 11 days. 'As a result of that delay, no positive cause of death could be established pathologically and there was no toxicology possible. 'I have no doubt that all caused further distress to the family. 'Assistance of the type you provided in the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence.' Murdered boyfriend: Beddoe helped Karen Otmani (right) hide the body of Shaun Corey (left) after she had drugged him and tied him to her bed at her home in south London, before either placing a plastic bag over his head or smothering him with a pillow on June 4 last year. She was jailed for life in November for murder . During Otmani’s trial, the jury at . Old Bailey heard that she had been talking about getting rid of her . on-off lover and had even asked another boyfriend to experiment with . some blue liquid to see if it would knock him out. Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, told the jury: 'When she began to speak about killing Mr Corey, he did not take it seriously.' Mr Corey was heard arguing with Otmani in her bedroom before they were joined by Beddoe, 60, whom she called Uncle. New boyfriend Keith Jones rang police after visiting the flat and being told 'He’s in there'. Miss Cheema said: 'She said she’d measured her freezer but it was too small and she needed to get another freezer. So badly decomposed: Judge Gerald Gordon told Beddoe at Old Bailey (pictured) that because Mr Corey's body was found 11 days after his death, the cause of death could not be established causing 'further distress to the family... the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence' The court heard that Otmani told officers: 'I killed him. He freaked me out and I killed him.' Described in court as a ‘wicked . liar’, mother-of-two Otmani had met Mr Corey, from Rossendale, . Lancashire, in 2007 through internet dating site ‘Plenty of Fish’ and in . 2010 they had a child together. The relationship became 'tempestuous and inconsistent' and the couple separated several times. Otmani was said to be angry when she found out that Mr Corey was seeing other women. Convicted and cleared: Beddoe was cleared of murder but convicted of assisting an offender . After discussing plans to kill him . with boyfriend Keith Jones, Otmani put Rohypnol into Mr Corey's can of . beer when he was at the flat on June 4 last year. He fell asleep and came round to find Otmani had tied him to the bed with her tights. A young boy in the house heard him screaming at Otmani to let him go as she called Beddoe to the maisonette to help her kill Mr Corey. The child was told Mr Corey was asleep because he was 'very, very tired'. Otmani sold Mr Corey's car and phone and used the wheelie bin as bedroom furniture. She even invited Mr Jones into her bedroom and asked if he could smell the decomposing corpse. He called the police but an initial search of the flat failed to reveal the body. It was not until June 15, 11 days after he was killed, that the wheelie bin was opened. By then in the heat of summer the body was too badly decomposed to establish a cause of death.","Bernie Beddoe: cleared of murder but convicted of assisting an offender .

Admitted child porn: Christopher Exley is a serving police officer who works for the Met's Special Operations, which protects the Royal Family . A serving policeman who works in the Met’s Special Operations division, which protects the Royal Family, has admitted downloading child porn. Christopher Exley, 33, faces jail after an illegal stash of pictures was found on his computer when his home in Clapton, east London was raided in February this year. Exley admitted having 53 indecent images, including 11 at level four which involves penetrative sexual activity containing a child or children, or both children and adults, after looking at websites at Southwark Crown Court. He denied arranging or facilitating a meeting to engage in sexual activity with a child, and this allegation was dropped by the prosecution. Exley has been suspended from his duties since his arrest and now faces the sack after his guilty pleas. He was due to stand trial today but the prosecution accepted his guilty pleas to four charges of making indecent images of children. No evidence was offered against him in respect of a charge of arranging sex with a boy, which he denied. He was freed on bail on the condition he stays away from children until a sentencing hearing at the same court on January 14. The Special Operations Division, in which Exley served, is an elite section of the Metropolitan Police service, which includes the Royal Protection squad and counter terrorism units. The case comes as the former business partner of Louise Mensch has been arrested on suspicion of viewing or possessing indecent images of children. Luke Bozier, Labour's former e-campaigns manager, was questioned by police last Friday. It follows allegations made online last week that he posted explicit photographs on Craigslist under a pseudonym. Illegal stash: Exley admitted having 53 indecent images including 11 at level four which involves penetrative sexual activity containing a child or children, or both children and adults, at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) New sentencing rules for courts that mean paedophiles who trade in child pornography will be spared jail were revealed last week. The Sentencing Council suggested community punishments for those convicted of trading or possessing child pornography in its guidelines on dealing with all types of sex crimes. People caught selling or distributing internet child pornography may receive ‘high level community orders’, and the council also proposed community orders for people possessing images of non-penetrative sex between adults and children. The current benchmark jail sentence for those with a small number of images is three months. Only those with pictures of children posing alone or small quantities of images of children engaged in sex acts, but not with adults, are not jailed.

'Looking down from a hovering helicopter you see the landscape from a birds eye perspective and suddenly everything becomes abstract and symmetrical with no distracting horizon line.

For many men December is the worst time of year because it means one thing: Christmas shopping. And this Christmas, Britain’s 12 million married men will waste up to 193 years of precious time if they decide to join spouses on shopping trips, waiting diligently outside changing rooms as wives turn the Christmas shop into an opportunity to treat themselves to some new clothes or shoes. And according to the latest survey, an average woman takes one hour and 41 minutes to make up their mind before buying a pair of shoes or item of clothing. Wasted time: Britain's 12 million married men will waste up to 193 years of precious time if they decide to join spouses on shopping trips . In December that equates to 1.7 million hours of so-called Lost Football Time (LFT) or 1.2 million 90-minute football matches. With the busiest shopping day of the year forecast for 23 December, the survey calculated that 60,000 man hours will be lost by bored, bag-carrying men that day. If men think it is bad enough joining their other halves on just one shopping trip a month, spare a thought for the partners of the fifth of women who admit they shop for clothes twice a month. And it appears that the fruits of men's labours go to waste anyway, as more than half of women admit to . never wearing an average of six items of clothing and three pairs of . shoes that are in their wardrobes. Lost football time: In December men will lose 1.7 million hours of football time . That equates to a whopping 87 million items of clothing remaining unworn in the wardrobes of Britain’s 28.5 million women.

He later took images of his car parked on his driveway which he claimed were taken at the same time - and proved he had returned the courtesy car before the incident. However, police officers later calculated that the length of shadows in pictures he submitted did not match with that time of year. Moore, of Plymstock, Devon, has now admitted acting with intent to pervert the course of justice and will be sentenced next year. Plymouth Crown Court heard how he was caught speeding on Billacombe Road in Plymstock at around noon on February 22 last year. David Gittins, prosecuting, said that only four minutes later he returned the courtesy Peugeot to a nearby garage and picked up his own car. Legal proceedings began but five months later he submitted footage from a home CCTV system which showed his Mitsubishi Pajero parked on his driveway.

Referring to to the raft of directives that come from Europe, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said Britain 'would do a lot better if we made more laws locally in our own Parliament'. In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Paterson also defended his handling of the ash tree crisis and branded TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh a 'muppet' for criticising him. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson (left) clashed with TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh (right) over the ash tree crisis, branding the celebrity a 'muppet' He also warned current fishing policies are a 'disaster', pledged to see through the badger cull and, in a departure from Government policy, said shale gas is a preferable alternative to wind farms. Mr Paterson told the Daily Telegraph Europe's determination to save the single currency was isolating Britain, but said the country would be better for being left behind. 'If in order to resolve the Euro crisis there has to be this new arrangement that’s effectively creating a new country from which we’re excluded, (then) we want to get our country back, which means making our laws in our own Parliament... 'We would do a lot better if we made a lot more laws locally in Europe,' he said. The former Northern Ireland Secretary also defended the Government's handling of the ash tree crisis . MP Mr Paterson said wind farms were 'inappropriate' and defended his handling of the ash tree crisis in the wide-ranging interview . The MP has also reiterated the Government's commitment to a badger cull to stop the spread of TB in cows . On Thursday he announced a ban on imports of the trees from Europe to stop the spread of a bacteria which is causing them to die, but Mr Titchmarsh thinks this should have been done earlier. The celebrity gardener also accused the Government of 'losing its roots' in rural areas, but Mr Paterson said he hadn't been paying enough attention. 'He is a complete muppet, missed completely everything we're doing,' he said. And the Environment minster slammed current fishing policies, saying they threaten to destroy the British industry . In a diversion from Conservative policy, Mr Paterson said wind farms were 'inappropriate' and 'matured in the Middle Ages', and said Britain should follow the United States and invest in shale gas, which doesn't require public subsidy, unlike wind farms. On fish stocks, he says the current Common Fisheries Policy is driving British fisherman out of business and revealed the Coalition is close to securing a ban on discards by which 'perfectly good fish' are dumped dead overboard because they don’t count towards the quota. Mr Paterson said the badger cull, to stop the spread of TB in cows, would go ahead next year after being postponed due to a combination of legal challenges and the animals going into hibernation.","Environment minister Owen Paterson says Britain would 'do better making own laws'

The 69-year-old, whose ex-husband owned a £15million nightclub business, had returned home to be ambushed by a gang of burglars who made off with her cash and jewellery. But although they bound her wrists, she managed to improvise...and dialled 999 on her phone by pressing the numbers with her tongue. Police were quickly dispatched to put an end to her 90-minute ordeal. The raiders waited until Shelia Quadrini, 69, had opened the door before forcing their way in. She was left bruised and shocked but was not seriously injured . She was attacked at her detached house in Gosforth at around 6.30pm on Thursday. A neighbour said: 'Things like this just do not happen around here.

They bundled her inside and ripped off . her jewellery before searching the house in the affluent Gosforth area . of Newcastle for  valuables. Before they left they tied her up and . doused her in petrol. Her ex-husband Michael Quadrini, who . owned the Tuxedo Princess floating nightclub in Gateshead along with a . string of bars and restaurants, said the encounter had left her bruised . and badly shaken up. ‘She was tied up for an hour and a half and had petrol poured on her and she had to dial the police with her tongue,’ he said. ‘She’s totally distressed, she’s in a state of shock and she doesn’t want to go back to the house.’ Sheila Quadrini (left) and her former husband Michael (right) before they were divorced in 1985 .

Mr Cameron branded it 'government by fax'. 'I believe Britain does have a future in Europe, particularly in the heart of the single market. It is very important that we are writing the rules of that market rather than just obeying them.' Big mouth: Mayor of London Boris Johnson revealed that the Prime Minister is going to announce his ideas for Britain's future relationship with the EU and that a referendum is on the cards . Mr Cameron will use his speech within weeks to insist he does not . think it would be in Britain’s interests to leave the EU but wants to . return to a more arms-length, trade-based relationship with Brussels. It is 'obvious' that an independent Scotland will have to reapply to join the EU, president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso said today. Asked if Scotland would need to reapply to join if it leaves the UK following the referendum in 2014, he said: 'I did not comment on specific situations of member states because I very much respect that it is their right, their sovereign right to decide about their organisation. 'Now what I said, and it is our doctrine and it is clear since 2004 in legal terms, if one part of a country - I am not referring now to any specific one - wants to become an independent state, of course as an independent state it has to apply to the European membership according to the rules. That is obvious,' he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme. The Westminster government insists Scotland would have to reapply, but the Holyrood government denies this. The Spanish government has vowed to veto admission for a new independent state, fearing the reaction from separatists in Catalonia. He is expected to set out details of how he wants to renegotiate our membership, repatriating powers in key areas. But . Mr Johnson, who has discussed plans for a referendum with Mr Cameron, . predicted voters would be offered ‘broadly an in/out referendum on the . new terms’. His intervention irritated Downing Street, which has been reluctant to discuss what the Prime Minister is planning. Former Tory cabinet minister Dr Liam Fox increased the pressure on the Prime Minister today, insisting that the party needs a ‘settled position that is clear, concise and consistent’. ‘The longer we hold a clear position, the more likely we are to be credible and thus to both take advantage of a growing trend amongst the British electorate and to see off parties such as UKIP by supplanting them rather than accommodating them,’ he said in a speech. The former defence secretary said public attitudes point towards a ‘new, looser and largely economic relationship with the European Union’, adding: ‘I, for one, hope to see “back to a common market” as the Conservative slogan on Europe at the next general election.’ ‘To be frank, if the choice is between the current trajectory towards ever closer union and leaving, then I would choose to leave, albeit reluctantly. ‘If the choice is between a looser, more economic relationship and leaving, then I would choose to stay. It is a view that , I believe, is gaining ever greater traction with the British people,’ he added. London Mayor Mr Johnson said yesterday that Britain should exploit the eurozone crisis to free itself from key areas of the EU, including fisheries policy, social policy and farming subsidies. He agreed with Mr Cameron that an in/out referendum on the current terms of membership was ill-advised, a shift from the position he held earlier this year. Secret vote: Downing street has been reluctant to reveal details of Prime Minister David Cameron's plans for Britain's relationship with the EU . ‘If you have a simple in/out referendum I think at the moment the chances are that the British people would say stuff that for a game of soldiers, and 56 per cent say let’s pull out,’ Mr Johnson told Sky News. Largely economic: Liam Fox wants to take the EU 'back to a common market' ‘Now the risk - and I’ve been writing . about Europe for about 25 years, and I spent a long time in Brussels as a . correspondent, and the really good bit about it is the single market -- . that’s something that allows British firms, British jobs, British . enterprise to work freely with other European countries in a way that I . think might be in peril if we were to pull out unilaterally. ‘So all I’m saying is let’s have a renegotiation in which we chop off the bits we don’t like, chop off all the kind of excrescences likes the fisheries policy and the social chapter or whatever. ‘I think probably what David Cameron is going to say, he’s got some speech coming up, I reckon he is going to commit to a referendum which will be broadly an in/out referendum on the new terms. ‘So we’ve got to go in and get a better deal for Britain, which is basically the single market, making sure that British ministers are in the internal market able to protect British interests, make sure that British companies continue to have unfettered access to that market.’ Mr Johnson, seen as one of Mr Cameron’s chief rivals for the Conservative party leadership, repeated his attacks on Eurozone countries for rushing ‘full tilt towards fiscal union’. As Mr Cameron prepared for a Brussels summit on Eurozone plans to coordinate banking policy later this week, the Mayor predicted such a union would be a ‘disaster’ for those countries that join it. Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair warned last month that Mr Cameron would be shunned by other EU leaders if he attempted to carve out a special deal for Britain in exchange for agreeing to a new Eurozone treaty on political and economic union.","David Cameron is due to set out major new policy on Europe within weeks .

The long-running Dominique Strauss-Kahn saga could come to an end today as his lawyers are set to appear in court alongside the hotel maid who claims he sexually assaulted her. The two sides are expected to announce that they have reached a financial settlement which could run into millions of dollars in return for Nafissatou Diallo dropping her civil lawsuit against the former head of the International Monetary Fund. The court date comes less than two weeks after it was widely reported that the pair had negotiated a settlement after months of haggling. Conclusion? Dominique Strauss-Kahn has allegedly reached a settlement with hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo . Troubles: The scandal ended Strauss-Kahn's presidential ambitions and wrecked his public reputation . However, a source said details of the settlement are not likely to be made public at the hearing, which is scheduled to begin at 2pm EST (7pm GMT) on Monday in New York State Supreme Court in the Bronx. The agreement would end a legal saga that began when Diallo, 33, told police that Strauss-Kahn attacked her in his suite at the Sofitel Hotel in Manhattan on May 14, 2011. The scandal forced Strauss-Kahn to resign his post as head of one of the world's most influential finance organisations and wrecked his hopes of running for president in his native France. New love: Strauss-Kahn was spotted visiting Venice with his new girlfriend Myriam Aouffir over the weekend . Relief: Strauss-Kahn will doubtless be pleased to bring an end to his long-running legal battle . Prosecutors initially expressed confidence in the evidence, including DNA that showed a sexual encounter. But they dropped the case in August 2011 after developing concerns about Diallo's credibility, including what they said were inconsistencies in her account of what happened immediately following the incident. She filed the lawsuit just weeks before the charges were dismissed, claiming he forced her to perform oral sex and caused her physical and emotional damage. Strauss-Kahn, 63, filed a countersuit earlier this year against Diallo for defamation. He has said the sexual encounter was consensual but has admitted it was a 'moral error.' Accusation: Diallo claims she was sexually assaulted by the former IMF boss in New York last May . The resolution of the civil case brings Strauss-Kahn closer to ending his legal troubles, which have persisted since his return to France. The former politician is awaiting a decision by a French court on his request to halt an inquiry to determine whether he should stand trial on pimping charges related to sex parties attended by him and by prostitutes. Strauss-Kahn has quietly begun to resume his career in recent months, delivering speeches at private conferences and setting up a consulting firm in Paris.","French politican's lawyers set to appear in court at 2pm EST (7pm GMT)

The Dallas Cowboys player accused of vehicular manslaughter was released from jail yesterday after posting bond - one day after the car crash that killed a fellow player. As he stepped out of the Irving City Jail, defensive tackle Josh Brent said he was 'just trying to deal' with the death of his teammate and 'very best friend' Jerry Brown. 'Jerry Brown was my very best friend, and I'm just trying to deal with his death right now,' Brent said, stopping briefly when asked if he had anything to say to Brown's family. Scroll down for video . Out of jail: Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Josh Brent is escorted out of Irving Jail by his attorney George Milner after posting $500,000 bond . He would not answer any other questions. Brent was behind the wheel of a 2007 Mercedes-Benz at about 2:20am on Saturday when the vehicle veered off the road, flipped at least once and slid about 900 feet. Brent has allegedly been speeding before the accident, which occurred hours before the team was due to fly to Cincinnati for Sunday's game against the Bengals. NFL.com reported that the car was on fire when police arrived, and officers spotted Brent pulling Brown out of the mangled car. Brown, a practice-squad linebacker who also was Brent's teammate for three seasons at the University of Illinois - was found unresponsive at the scene and pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Attorney George Milner bemoaned the fact that Brent's bond was set '16 times higher than it would have been for . anybody that doesn't play for the Dallas Cowboys.' 'He is torn up,' Milner said. 'It's not a good moment for anyone. I'm going to take him home. He needs family around him.' Meanwhile, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported . that the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission would be investigating the . club where several Cowboys may have been before the crash. The agency said it would be interviewing other clubgoers, bartenders and any other witnesses. Deceased: Jerry Brown (in a 2012 file photo) died in the accident at 2:20am on December 7, 2012, in the Dallas suburb of Irving . Release: Brent did not answer questions from reporters as he walked out of the Irving City Jail . If it is found that players were served alcohol while visibly intoxicated, the club could be subject to heavy fines and face the loss of its liquor license. TABC spokeswoman Carolyn Beck told the Star-Telegram: 'We're establishing where [the players] had been and if they were sold alcohol while they were drunk.' The club was not immediately identified, but reports indicated that it was Privae Dallas, where comedian Shawn Wayans was performing on Friday night. The Cowboys bowed their heads in a moment of silence for Brown before their game against the Bengals yesterday - the second straight weekend that an NFL game was preceded by tragedy. Last week, Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher killed his girlfriend before committing suicide in front of his coach and general manager at the team's stadium. Second tragedy: Dallas Cowboys players hang their heads during a moment of silence today honoring teammate Jerry Brown who was killed in an accident last night. Lineman Josh Brent has been charged with DUI manslaughter . Crash: Tire skid marks are seen leaving the road where the car driven by Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent crashed on Saturday morning.

He was reportedly speeding and hit a curb, . flipping the car . Before the game, the Bengals held a . moment of silence before the national anthem. Most Cowboys bowed their . heads, and Dallas quarterback Tony Romo and several other players had . their hands over their hearts. On Fox's NFL Sunday show, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team had focused on Brown's death in the 'last few hours.' He didn't mention Brent. 'First of all we all know, but we remind ourselves that there is something more important than football, and this is life, and certainly the lost life of Jerry,' Jones said on the TV show. 'On the other hand, they know the best way they can honor Jerry, because he was such a hard worker, so conscientious and enthusiastic about his career.' Best friends: Brent is charged with intoxication manslaughter that resulted in the death of his passenger and teammate whom he's since called his best friend . Reality check: Brent's charge of intoxication manslaughter is a second-degree felony that's punishable by two to 20 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000 . Officers conducted a field sobriety . test on Brent and arrested him on suspicion of driving while . intoxicated, Argumaniz said. The charge, a second-degree felony . punishable by two to 20 years in prison, was upgraded after Brown was . pronounced dead. In February 2009, Brent was arrested . in February 2009 near the Illinois campus for driving under the . influence, driving on a suspended license and speeding, according to . Champaign County, Illinois, court records. In June 2009, Brent pleaded guilty to . DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 . hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000. As part of his . plea deal, prosecutors dropped one count of aggravated DUI/no valid . driver's license. Brent successfully completed his probation in July . 2011, court records show.

Dallas Cowboys' Josh Price- Brent (pictured in Jan. 2012) is facing an intoxication manslaughter charge after a one-vehicle accident that killed linebacker Jerry Brown, a member of the team's practice squad . Brent, a nose tackle, has played in . all 12 games this season and played a bigger role than expected with . starter Jay Ratliff battling injuries.

Hero: Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who admitted in a letter that he suffered seasickness . Famed for his fearless leadership during the Napoleonic war, Admiral Horatio Nelson is undoubtedly a national hero. But a letter sent from Nelson's flagship the HMS Victory has revealed that even the inspirational commander occasionally struggled with life at sea. In the previously unseen letter which has gone on display at the Tunbridge Wells Museum and Art Gallery, Admiral Nelson confesses to being seasick. Nelson wrote the letter to the 2nd Earl of Camden in October 1804 to explain why his nephew had left the HMS Victory just a few months after joining the Navy. He wrote: 'I am ill every time it blows hard and nothing but my enthusiastic love for the profession keeps me one hour at sea.' It was sent to Lord Camden's home at Bayham Abbey estate, near Frant, East Sussex, and Nelson tells Lord Camden that 16-year-old Francis James left HMS Victory because he was not suited to naval life and suffered from seasickness - a condition he could sympathise with. Now the letter has gone on display at Tunbridge Wells Museum. In the letter, which was found recently in the Camden family archives, Nelson also discusses the military and political situation with Lord Camden, who was secretary of state for war and the colonies at the time. A spokeswoman for Tunbridge Wells Museum said the letter was 'hugely important because of its historical context'. She added 'The letter was written in October 1804 from HMS Victory in the Mediterranean where Nelson was permanently stationed to counter French influence. 'This was just a year before his great victory - and death - at the Battle of Trafalgar. 'The letter links Admiral Horatio Nelson with the local noble Camden family who lived on the Bayham Abbey estate. Artifact: Written in October 1804, the letter to the 2nd Earl of Camden has gone on public display for the first time . Understanding: The letter sympathetically explains why the Earl's nephew left the Navy just months after joining - because he suffered greatly from seasickness . Iconic warship: The letter was sent from Nelson's flagship HMS Victory which is now docked at Portsmouth Harbour . 'It also gives a fascinating insight into the character of this great naval hero.' In November a letter from Nelson to his lover Lady Emma Hamilton was sold at auction for £20,000. The Nelson letter has been chosen for display by Mike Bevan, Assistant Archivist at the National Maritime Museum. Experts there were excited to learn about this new discovery and have helped to put it in its historical context. The letter is on long-term loan to the museum from the Camden family. In action: HMS Victory depicted during the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . Hero: A portrait of Admiral Nelson by Lemuel Francis Abbott (1760-1802). The Naval commander became synonymous with the HMS Victory in 1803 . HMS Victory was launched in 1765 at Chatham Dockyard and was used in active duty for 34 years from 1778. It is the only surviving warship that fought in the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars. The first rate 100 gun ship was designed by the Surveyor of the Navy, Sir Thomas Slade. The famous ship became the fladship of a string of fine Admirals including Admiral Keppel, Admiral Kempenfelt, Admiral Hood and Admiral Sir John Jervis. But it wasn't until May 1803 that the ship became synonymous with Admiral Horatio Nelson. With the threat of invasion by Napoleon causing renewed hostility with France, the ship carried the newly appointed Commander in Chief Nelson to the Mediterranean on May 16. For the next 18 months Nelson blockaded the French fleet in Toulon to prevent them escaping to join forces with other squadrons based on France's Atlantic arsenals. Its finest hour came at the Battle of trafalgar in 1805. In September 1805, the Victory sailed with Nelson from Portsmouth to join a blockading fleet under Collingwood off Cadiz. French commander Villeneuve's orders were to take the combined Franco-Spanish fleet into the Mediterranean. On October 18 1805 frigates signalled that the enemy were weighing anchor. Villeneuve's fleet, now comprising 33 ships of the line, headed for Gibraltar but, unable to shake off the British fleet, turned back for Cadiz and inevitable combat. As day broke on Monday 21 October 1805, off Cape Trafalgar, Nelson's fleet of 27 ships formed into two columns and sailed towards the enemy. Battle commenced with Collingwood's division breaching the rear of the enemy fleet. War: 'The Battle of Trafalgar' - as painted by Clarkson Stanfield, 1805 . Nelson in Victory followed shortly, driving into the centre and opening a devastating fire into the stern of Villeneuve's flagship Bucentaure. Victory then engaged and grappled the Redoutable. But when the fighting was at its fiercest, Nelson was shot by a French marksman and taken below where he died at later the same afternoon. By this time the enemy had been routed and a great victory won. 17 ships had been captured and one, the French Achille, blew up as a finale to the battle. The French battle-fleet was never again a threat. Much damaged, the Victory was towed to Gibraltar and finally returned to Portsmouth, arriving on December 4 1805, bearing her dead Admiral. Wounded: The death of Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. Painting by Daniel Maclise, Houses of Parliament . After repairs at Chatham, the Victory was recommissioned in March 1808. For the next 4 years she was on active service in the Baltic and off the coasts of Spain. In 1812, now 47 years old, she finally returned to Portsmouth on December 4 and paid off 16 days later, ending her sea-going life. For the next 110 years the Victory remained at her moorings in Portsmouth Harbour fulfilling a combination of practical and ceremonial roles. In 1922, amid fears for her continued survival, the Victory was moved into Portsmouth's Royal Naval Dockyard and placed in No2 Dry Dock. Work then began on restoring the Victory to her 'fighting' 1805 condition and continues today.

Social services and mental health workers made 'serious and cumulative failings' that contributed to the deaths of two children who were killed by their mentally-ill mother, a coroner ruled today. Paranoid schizophrenic Vivian Gamor killed ten-year-old Antoine Gamor-Ogunkoya and his sister Kenniece, three, when the children were allowed to stay with her unsupervised overnight in January 2007. She was allowed to have the children without supervision on three separate visits and on the third bludgeoned . Antoine to death with a hammer and suffocated Kenniece with cling film . at her flat in Pembury Close, Hackney, east London. Tragic: Ten-year-old Antoine Ogunkoya (left) and his sister Keniece Ogunkoya, three, were killed by their mother during an unsupervised visit . Assistant Deputy Coroner for Inner London North Selena Lynch said today their mother probably would not have been given unsupervised access if the risks to the children had been 'properly recognised and managed'. The inquest heard social services told the children's father Gabriel 'Jimi' Ogunkoya there was nothing he could do to stop Gamor seeing them. This was despite her having been sectioned under the Mental Health Act in the past for threatening a relative with a knife and believing her children had been swapped at birth. She also had not had contact with the pair for several months before she asked to see them. Loving father Mr Ogunkoya told the inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court last month he was told he could not stop contact between the children and Gamor, who had parental responsibility. He said he had told social worker . Catherine Edwards that his former partner had requested overnight . contact with the children after one brief supervised day visit and was not comfortable with increased access. He said: 'Catherine Edwards told me that . there is nothing to stop her from seeing the children as I don't have . parental responsibility. I didn't have a leg to stand on.' He said he was getting advice . from lawyers about seeking parental responsibility at the time but . allowed two overnight visits which seemed to have gone well. However, Gamor killed the children on the third. The court heard that the couple's . relationship deteriorated around 2002 and two years later she started . denying the two children were hers. By January 2006, Mr Ogunkoya was in contact with social services and Gamor had stopped seeing the children. Gamor, a paranoid schizophrenic, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after threatening a relative with a knife in 2006, when a referral was made to Hackney Social Services. But . after her condition apparently improved, she was allowed unsupervised . access to her children, who were in the care of Mr Ogunkoya. Mrs Lynch said their father was not told there was any risk to his children. She said: 'The children wanted . to see their mother, and the father was led to believe that he could . not prevent the mother from having contact. 'He . was not made aware that there was any risk to the children. In the . absence of any word from social services, the parents made their own . arrangements for contact. 'When . mental health and social services learned that further contact had . taken place without their supervision, they acquiesced in the . arrangement, and social services decided to close the file and take no . further part in safeguarding the children.' After the short period of supervised contact, there was a total failure to carry out any risk assessment, the coroner said. An inquiry was launched when Gamor was detained indefinitely after admitting two counts of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in August 2007. The coroner said that Mr Ogunkoya was a loving father and was not to blame for what happened to his children. 'Heartfelt condolences': Alan Wood, director of children's services at Hackney Council, said social service work has since been 'transformed' 'I hope he is able to make a good life for himself notwithstanding the terrible and enduring grief he must suffer,' she added. In her narrative conclusions, she said the mother had delusions about her children, believing they had been swapped for her children who were stillborn. 'She was prescribed medication but had probably stopped taking it for some days prior to the killings,' the coroner said. Mrs Lynch said 'insufficient thought' had been given to the possibility that Gamor's condition was not fully controlled or that she may relapse. She said: 'There were serious and cumulative failures by social service and mental health workers to collaborate and liaise with each other, to fully share or request information from the other, and to inform and support the father. 'Mental health services focused on the mother's condition and failed to assess the risk she might pose to the children. 'Social workers failed to carry out important tasks in a timely fashion or at all, partly because they had too much to do and were not adequately supported. 'Their managers failed to supervise or manage them in spite of obvious performance issues, poor working relationships, and staff absences and shortages.' The coroner said that because of various changes which have been made since, she would not be making any report to the authorities. Alan Wood, director of children's services at Hackney Council, said the deaths were a 'terrible tragedy'. He said: 'Our heartfelt condolences go out to Mr Ogunkoya and his family. 'As the coroner has identified, the social work service for children in Hackney has been transformed over the last six years. We can never be complacent about our work to keep children safe and our social workers have studied carefully the issues in this tragic case. 'In close partnership with colleagues in other services, we continue our vigilance to ensure we are together doing all that we possibly can to keep children safe.' Inquest: Social services and mental health workers made 'serious and cumulative failures' the hearing at Poplar Coroner's Court, pictured, was told . Dr Robert Dolan, chief executive, East London NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We offer our deepest and most sincere condolences to the children's father, grandparents and other family members. 'We have worked very closely with our partners in the local authority, community services and the police to strengthen and improve our care and management of the whole family when the person with a mental illness is also a parent.' He said training is now mandatory to all staff that emphasise the importance of assessing needs to all children whose parent has a mental illness, even if they are not living together. He added: 'Following this incident, the National Patient Safety Agency issued guidance to all NHS trusts which has been embedded in our training. 'The Trust acknowledges that people with mental health problems should not be denied a relationship with their children. We recognise that they may pose a risk of emotional or physical harm to their children and this risk needs to be assessed and managed appropriately. 'Since 2007, we have reviewed and improved practice in all our community mental health teams across the Trust and will continue to prioritise the needs of the whole family, including children.'","Vivan Gamor killed her children Antoine Gamor-Ogunkoya, and his sister Kenniece, three, in Hackney in 2007 .

David Cameron claimed that TV debates 'sucked the life' out of the general election campaign . The TV debates which dominated the last general election are unlikely to be repeated after David Cameron claimed yesterday that they ‘sucked the life’ out of the campaign. The Conservatives are expected to propose a single leaders’ debate, probably taking place before the formal election campaign starts, with a different format to the three that took place in 2010. Tory strategists believe the TV debates, the first to take place in Britain, probably cost the party an overall majority at the last election. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, a relative unknown compared to Gordon Brown and Mr Cameron, enjoyed a surge of support after unscientific push-button polling of viewers meant he was seen to have ‘won’ the first debate. Though so-called ‘Cleggmania’ faded as the campaign went on, it helped shore up the Lib Dem position and enabled them to hang on to dozens of vulnerable seats, senior Conservatives believe. The debates are also seen to have crowded out coverage of other important elements of the campaign. Though they do not believe Ed Miliband would put up a strong performance in a fresh round of debates, Tories fear Labour will seek to mimic Mr Clegg’s success by positioning him as a relative unknown against two established figures. Mr Cameron signalled yesterday that he wants to see changes to the format of any debates if he is to take part again in 2015. ‘I think TV debates are good. I enjoyed them last time - particularly the last one,’ he told a Westminster lunch. ‘We have a fixed-term parliament now, . so we can think about it in a slightly different way. I haven’t made my . mind up exactly what we should do but I am in favour of these debates. ‘My . reflection on last time was that they did suck all the life out of the . campaign. The press and all of us were interested in the run-up to the . debate, the debate and the post-debate analysis, not the rest of the . campaign, which I really enjoy. Tories fear that Labour will try to emulate Nick Clegg's (right) success when he 'won' the first TV debate by putting Ed Miliband (left) up against two established figures . ‘I like campaigning, I like being out there, the public meetings, the awkward moments, the difficulties - it is an incredibly exciting time, trying to explain what you are about and what you are trying to do. ‘I found the TV debates took all the life out of it.’ Britain’s first-ever televised general election leaders’ debates were staged on BBC, ITV and Sky News in 2010 after prolonged negotiations between the parties and the TV companies, which resulted in strict rules on the style of questioning and the division of time for leaders’ answers.","Tories expected to propose a single leaders' debate with a different format .

Kimberley Walsh, who’s been stuck in a dancing rut for ages and nearly got booted off, not only topped the leaderboard but scored the only 40 of the series so far. Then Denise Van Outen, who has been the stand-out dancer and the one to beat, ended up in the dance-off. Blimey, what drama! After all that excitement I think I need to lie down in a darkened room and be fanned by a (shirtless) Artem. Earning the perfect score for a routine is Strictly’s ultimate accolade and one that only a handful of the celebrity dancers ever manage to achieve. But on Saturday night Kimberley Walsh – or ‘Nimble Kimble’ as she’s been nicknamed on the show – joined their ranks following her half cha-cha-cha, half tango routine. Cha-cha-stars: Kimberley Walsh and partner Pasha danced their way to a 40 . It was enough to earn a standing  ovation from Len Goodman and cries of ‘the dance of the series’ from a highly excitable Bruno. And it’s not just fancy footwork that our Kimberley had down pat – whether she’s fired up for the tango or letting it all hang out in the salsa, the girl pouts better than a toddler on the naughty step. Dance fusion, stolen from Dancing With The Stars – the American version of Strictly – is a new, and somewhat baffling, concept that seemed to have left audience, presenters and dancers alike in a state of complete confusion. Competing couples had to blend two different dances into one routine using just one piece of music. Kimberley Walsh's routine was met with a standing ovation from Len Goodman while Bruno labelled it 'the dance of the series' Taking it to the max: Judges Craig Revel Horwood, Darcey Bussell, Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli . Why do this instead of just performing two separate dances is anybody’s guess, but as it appears to have, thankfully, replaced the god-awful swing-a-thon then I’m not complaining. Denise, the contestant who consistently puts in the most hours of training, kicked things off with her jive and quickstep routine which Craig Revel Horwood dismissed as ‘a bit boring’. Boring? Denise Van Outen with her partner James ended up in the dance-off . Her score of 35 left her in fourth place (out of six) on the leader board and in last night’s dance-off with Nicky Byrne. Thanks to the judges, Denise was saved and  Nicky left the show, but if it had been solely down to the public  vote then I’m not sure she would have survived. The question of whether Denise’s experience in musical theatre gives her an unfair advantage has never gone away and there’s a strong feeling on many of the Strictly online forums that she shouldn’t be in the final in a fortnight’s time. Conspiracy theorists were given plenty of food for thought last week, when it was mysteriously announced that producers were changing the rules this year to have four, instead of the usual three, couples in the final. Is it all a ploy to get Denise to the final? Or maybe Lisa, who, good as she is, is not quite up to the standard of the others? Who knows. But, surely, more people dancing on a dance show can only be a good thing? While Denise suffered a setback, dinky Dani Harmer gets better every week and finished second to Kimberley with her quickstep and Charleston mix. It helped that she at least got two dances that vaguely went together, unlike poor Nicky, who had to cobble together a samba and an American smooth. Following his brilliant performance in the Charleston in the previous show, Louis Smith kept up the high standard with his tango and rumba fusion. Louis revealed that winning the Strictly trophy would mean a great deal to him, since he has won only silver and bronze medals as an Olympian. Ahh. Bless. I’m guessing he hasn’t seen the trophy, otherwise he’d know it’s just a disco glitterball glued to an old shoe box.","CLAUDIA CONNELL: VIEW FROM THE SOFA .

Links: Sir David Bell, who is one of Lord Leveson's key advisers, is also on the board of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism . A senior adviser helping Lord Leveson's inquiry into press standards is a trustee of the organisation behind the shambolic Newsnight report that falsely implicated Lord McAlpine as a paedophile, it has emerged. Sir David Bell is on the board of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, whose botched investigation into abuse at a north Wales children's home has left its reputation in tatters. The former chairman of the Financial Times is also one of six senior figures aiding Leveson's inquiry, whose official report is due out this month. Meanwhile the head of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism Iain Overton has quit after starting the crisis that has ripped through the . BBC. His name and photo has been removed from the Bureau's website and his . linked Twitter account, which announced the disastrous Newsnight . investigation to the world before it was broadcast, has been shut down. 'An appointment of an Interim Editor is likely to be announced in the near term.An inquiry to establish the role of The Bureau in the story is in urgent progress. An interim report will be issued as soon as possible,' a BIJ spokesman said. 'Trustees reaffirm The Bureau’s commitment to fact-based, non-sensational investigation in the public interest. Any role by the Bureau or its officers in this story was strictly contrary to the fundamental principles and standards of the Bureau.' MailOnline has been told Mr Overton was diagnosed with a serious and . life-changing illness that led to him consuming 'potent medication' and . ‘taking his eye off the ball' as the investigation was put together by . his staff, a source close to him said. Gone: Former BBC journalist Iain Overton has quit the BIJ today for his part in the scandal . He is 'distraught' at what had happened and is 'desperate to . apologise', they added. 'Iain is distraught and mortified by his tweet and what happened . next. He desperately wants . to say sorry. 'He fears he has undone years of hard-work for him and the Bureau.' The source added that his Twitter post was something 'he deeply . regretted' and despite Mr Overton later erasing the message all the . damage was done. But the source said the BBC, not the bureau, should blamed for taking the decision to go ahead with it. 'The moment the BBC take an investigation from the Bureau then all . editorial decisions leave their hands and are taken by them’. Mr Overton spent yesterday holding crisis talks with the group’s trust over its role in the fiasco. In the spotlight: Bureau reporter Angus Stickler who led the Newsnight probe into child abuse in north Wales . It is understood that Mr Overton . receives an annual salary and pension totalling £75,000, plus a . discretionary bonus of up to £6,000 per year. He was previously a commissioning executive at ITN and a senior producer at the BBC. His staff – including reporter Angus Stickler – had worked with the BBC on the botched report which has already forced the resignation of director general George Entwistle. But it was a message Mr Overton tweeted in which he claimed Newsnight was about to reveal ‘a very senior political figure who is a paedophile’ which prompted an online storm. Although Mr Overton did not identify Lord McAlpine – and Newsnight chose not to – the former Conservative Party chairman’s name was soon widely linked to the investigation. A statement from the BIJ said: 'The Trustees are appalled at what appears to be a breach of its standards. 'To the extent that the principles of the Bureau have been ignored by an involvement in this story, remedial action will be taken against those responsible.' The BIJ was founded in 2009 with a £2million donation from a charitable foundation run by computer tycoon David Potter, a former Labour donor, and his wife Elaine Potter, a former Sunday Times investigative journalist. Based out of subsidised offices in London's City University, the BIJ employs a combination of experienced journalists and students, including interns from the university's journalism department. At its launch, some of the most respected investigative journalists in the industry gave the project their backing. In 2009 Nick Davies, the journalist who exposed the News of the World hacking scandal, freedom-of-information campaigner Heather Brooke, David Leigh were among 20 journalists who met to set up a new organisation to promote investigative journalism. The BIJ was an offshoot of those meetings but Mr Davies, Mr Leigh and Ms Brooke have never had any role in its inception at all or any connection to the bureau since. The few journalists who appear to be on permanent staff include Mr Overton and Mr Stickler, who was once named News Journalist of the Year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. Scoop: Newsnight, presented by Jeremy Paxman, failed to reveal the man's identity and the BBC has so far refused to comment . Investigations he has worked on in the past two years include an exposé on 'counterfeit pharmaceuticals, corporate killings in Iraq, human rights abuses by the Brazilian police and Glasgow gang-land murders linked to security contracts,' he says on his website. He has won one Peabody Award, two Amnesty International Awards, a OneWorld Award, a Prix Circom, a BAFTA Scotland and 3 RTS nominations. Last night a source said Mr Overton had been taking 'potent medication' for a recently diagnosed serious illness and that this, in part, had led to him to tweet 'unwisely'. The source added that his Twitter post was something 'he deeply regretted'. Mr Overton later erased the message but the damage was done. He is now under pressure to quit. A source who works at the City of London university where his team are based told the Mail Online: 'He will be lucky to survive.' The BIJ claims to have been behind 47 front page stories since its launch and has won awards from Amnesty International and Thomson Reuters. Explosive: Managing Editor of the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Iain Overton, revealed the scoop online . Tweeting: A message from Ian Overton today ass he faces pressure to quit over his earlier online message . But it attracted controversy in August over a joint investigation with Newsnight which claimed the charity Help For Heroes used some of its money to subsidise Ministry of Defence building projects rather than help for injured service personnel. The charity claimed the report was misleading. The McAlpine investigation was handled by BIJ 'lead reporter' Mr Stickler, a former BBC journalist who worked on Radio 4's Today programme and File on Four. He was seconded to Newsnight to work on the abuse investigation, under the supervision of acting editor Liz Gibbon, to preserve the BBC's editorial control. Mr Stickler issued a statement through the National Union of Journalists yesterday, saying he was cooperating with reviews by the BBC and the BIJ, but would make no public comment until they were completed. All reports by the Bureau have been suspended by the BBC.","Sir David Bell is one of six key people helping Leveson with his probe into press standards and is a trustee of  Bureau of Investigative Journalism .

IT glitch: RBS Chief Executive Stephen Hester said he was sorry for the difficulties customers were facing . Stephen Hester, boss of NatWest owner RBS, tonight personally apologised for the technical glitches that have left the bank in chaos. The chief executive said 1,200 branches would be opened nationwide tomorrow morning to tackle the problems caused by faulty computer software. Mr Hester admitted that NatWest had let down its customers after hundreds of people vented their anger over the issue. The IT glitch has led to payments going missing, wages disappearing and holidays and home purchases being disrupted. Account balances were not updated properly overnight, meaning credit and debit payments were not showing up as quickly as they should. In a statement released tonight, Mr Hester said: 'I am very sorry for the difficulties people are experiencing. 'Our customers rely on us day in and day out to get things right, and on this occasion we have let them down. 'This should not have happened. 'Right now my top priority, and the priority of the entire RBS Group, is to fix these problems and put things right for our customers. 'This is taking time, but I want to reassure people that we are working around the clock to resolve these problems as quickly as we are able.' Mr Hester, who owns a £7million home and earns £1.2m a year, bowed to pressure and declined a £963,000 bonus last month. Empty wallets: NatWest cashpoints across the country were left out of order because of 'technical difficulties' NatWest - owned by taxpayer-funded RBS - . admitted the breakdown resulted in money credited to customers accounts . overnight not appearing in their balances 'as it should'. In some cases people were left homeless after the computer problems meant house purchases fell through. The bank said: 'We appreciate this has caused an unacceptable level of inconvenience. 'We have fixed the initial problem and our priority has been to work round the clock to sort the backlog as soon as possible.' Today over 900 branches extended their opening hours until 6pm and they will open again from 9am until 12pm tomorrow to cope with emergencies. Frustrations: Branches will open tomorrow to deal with problems including unpaid wages and disrupted mortgage payments . Others were stranded abroad, unable to access funds which should have been in their account. Frustrated customers said the bank's response was not good enough, with some vowing to take their business away. The problem arose after staff tried to install a software update on RBS’s payment processing system, but ended up corrupting it. When checking their accounts on Wednesday many customers found their balances had not updated properly to show new payments in. This meant those relying on wages being paid in were unable to pay their mortgage and other bills. Anger: NatWest allowed customers to post their 'feedback' on their website - and people were using it to record their disgust . Three days later, many of those payments have still not appeared – meaning thousands of customers are now likely to have been hit by penalty charges for missing the payments. Although the banking group has promised that no one will be out of pocket as a result of the problems, it may take weeks to clear the backlog of claims. The problems have hit 7.5million personal customers, many business customers and 100,000 customers of Ulster Bank. Messaging boards were flooded yesterday with complaints from those who were unable to access wages or who had their cards declined in shops.","Account balances did not update, leading to unpaid bills and missing wages .

Ian Duncan Smith: Family breakdown should be at the top of the agenda for tackling child poverty according to the Work and Pensions Secretary . Children whose parents have separated could be as impoverished as those in poor families, Iain Duncan Smith will suggest today. In a radical move, the Work and Pensions Secretary will propose that family breakdown should be included in a new official measure of determining child poverty. Little more than half of British children still live with both their birth parents by the time they are 15, according to the latest Government statistics. Eight out of ten babies are born to couples living together, but that figure falls to only 55 per cent as they grow up. Mr Duncan Smith will argue that family breakdown is a key indicator of children's likelihood to succeed later in life and should be included in a new, broader measure of child poverty. This will prompt outrage from Labour MPs, who are likely to accuse the Government of deliberately changing the goalposts to mask the impact of its austerity policies and stigmatising children whose families have broken up. But Mr Duncan Smith will insist that the last government's strategy of spending more than £170billion in extra benefit payments for poor families comprehensively failed to address the issue. Despite the huge increase in welfare spending, Labour failed to meet its aim of halving child poverty by 2010/11. Its measure of poverty – 60 per cent of median earnings – was enshrined in law. But the Coalition has agreed to tear up Labour's flagship measure – insisting that basing it purely on a crude assessment of family income is perverse, when other factors can determine children's life chances. In a speech, Mr Duncan Smith will suggest other factors in determining child poverty – including whether or not their parents are in work, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health. Work – not a few pounds extra in welfare handouts – is one of the main factors in lifting families out of poverty, he will argue. The Work and Pensions Secretary says the Government's universal credit, which will replace all out-of-work benefits from next year, will ensure the vast majority of children will be lifted out of poverty if at least one parent works 35 hours a week at the minimum wage, or 24 hours if they are a lone parent. Mr Duncan Smith, speaking at the Clyde Children's Centre in Deptford, south-east London alongside Lib Dem schools minister David Laws, will say: 'It is widely understood that the current relative income measure by itself is not providing an accurate picture of child poverty. 'A fixation on relative income, on moving people over an arbitrary line, does little to identify those most in need and entrenched in disadvantage, nor to transform their lives.' He said that a few extra pounds a week in benefits would not help families who were not only poor but also afflicted by 'worklessness, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health'. 'Worse still, unless there is a meaningful, sustainable change in the lives of the recipients, they become more dependent, not less, resulting in poor social outcomes and deeper entrenchment. 'Entrenched in disadvantage': The Coalition Government claims Labour's campaign to end child poverty was a failure . 'We must learn the lessons of the previous decade, where despite Labour's best intentions and despite an unprecedented level of spending – £171billion on tax credits and a 60 per cent real increase in welfare bills, the Government failed to reach their target to halve child poverty by 2010. 'The ""poverty plus a pound"" approach failed because the root causes of poverty were left unchecked, and not enough was done to break the cycle of disadvantage. 'No statistic will ever perfectly reflect what it means for a child to live in poverty. Nevertheless, I believe it is possible to develop a better indicator than the current measure, one which does more to reflect vital childhood experiences: growing up in a stable family, seeing a parent go out to work, going to a good school.' Mr Laws will add: 'The experience of child poverty is about more than whether their family income this week is low. 'This consultation is not about abandoning the past. Nor is it about massaging the figures. 'It is instead about recognising the many dimensions of child poverty and concentrating policy on longer term solutions and not on short term fixes.' Labour set a target to reduce the number of children living in relative income poverty to 1.7million by 2010/11. This was not met, with 2.3million children living in relative income poverty in that year. However, in the Coalition's first year there was a reduction of 300,000 children living in relative income poverty. Ministers admit, however that this was not the result of incomes rising for the poorest, but was largely due to a significant drop in the median income, demonstrating the absurdity of the current measure.","Family breakdown is a key indicator of children's likelihood to succeed, says Work and Pensions Secretary .

Muslim cabinet minister Baroness Warsi said race was a factor in the abuse of young white girls by Pakistani men . Muslim cabinet minister Baroness Warsi today dramatically hit out at the 'small minority' of Pakistani men who see white girls as 'fair game' for sexual abuse. In comments following the Rochdale grooming scandal involving nine Muslim men, the Conservative Party co-chairman admitted that race was a factor. She urged Muslim leaders to address the issue and ensure that men who regard white women as 'third class citizens' are isolated by their communities. Nine Muslim men, mainly of Pakistani origin, were found guilty last week of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs so they could 'pass them around' and use them for sex. After the trial, Greater Manchester Police sought to play down suggestions of any racial element to the case, as did Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee. But Lady Warsi, who grew up in a Pakistani community in Yorkshire, told London’s Evening Standard newspaper: 'There is a small minority of Pakistani men who believe that white girls are fair game. 'And we have to be prepared to say that. You can only start solving a problem if you acknowledge it first. 'This small minority who see women as second class citizens, and white women probably as third class citizens, are to be spoken out against.' Lady Warsi, Britain’s most senior Muslim politician, said she had decided to speak out after her father - who moved to the UK from the Punjab - told her she should be 'out there condemning it as loudly as you could'. 'In mosque after mosque, this should be raised as an issue so that anybody remotely involved should start to feel that the community is turning on them,' she said. 'Communities have a responsibility to stand up and say, ‘'This is wrong, this will not be tolerated'’.' She also urged the authorities to have the confidence to tackle allegations involving minorities. 'Cultural sensitivity should never be a bar to applying the law,' she said. The abuse began at two takeaways in the Heywood area of Rochdale, including the Balti House (pictured), which is under new ownership . Under new ownership: The Tasty Bites takeaway - now renamed Bakar's - was the other takeaway at the centre of the scandal . The case sparked national outrage as the nine Asian men were jailed for a total of 77 years. The men - who are all from Pakistan, apart from one who is from Afghanistan - were found guilty of raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. They were found to have groomed and 'shared' the young white girls because they were vulnerable. Despite overwhelming claims that the targeting of young white girls was a cultural problem, several senior figures were accused of 'burying their heads in the sand' by denying the link. Police played down the racial backgrounds of the men, saying the girls – mostly from broken or ‘chaotic’ homes – were targeted because they were vulnerable, not because they were white. Evil: Abdul Qayyum (left), 43, was sentenced to five years for conspiracy. Mohammed Amin (right) 45, was handed five years for conspiracy and sexual assault. The gang's 59-year-old ringleader, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was sentenced to 19 years in jail . Monsters: Abdul Aziz (left), 41, was given nine years for conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation. Mohammed Sajid (right), 35, received 12 years tor conspiracy, trafficking, one count of rape and one count of sexual activity with a child . Scum: Hamid Safi (left), 22, was given four years for conspiracy and trafficking but not guilty of two counts of rape. Adil Khan (right), 42, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation . Kabeer Hassan (left), 25, was jailed for nine years for conspiracy and rape. Abdul Rauf (right), 43, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and jailed for six years . Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'It is not a racial issue. This is about adults preying on vulnerable young children. It just happens that in this particular area and time the demographics were that these were Asian men. Backing them, Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, told said that highlighting the Pakistani origin of all but one of the gang risked giving ammunition to the far-Right. But Martin Narey, former chief executive of children’s charity Barnardo’s, said there was a ‘real problem’ which had to be confronted. ‘There is very troubling evidence that Asians are overwhelmingly represented in prosecutions for such offences,’ he said. Mr Narey added that ‘vulnerable girls on the street at night are generally white rather than more strictly-parented Asian girls’. This was even backed up by equalities chief Sir Trevor Phillips described as ‘fatuous’ the idea that there was no racial link in the Rochdale child sex grooming case. Mr Phillips, the chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, said it would be a ‘national scandal’ if it emerged that social services and schools had not acted on reports of abuse for fear of ‘demonising’ minority communities. He was asked on BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show whether the case illustrated a cultural problem in part of the Pakistani Muslim community about the way men regard white women as ‘fair game’. Mr Phillips replied: ‘Let’s remember the most important thing about this is that these men are criminals; these children are street kids. ‘However, I think anybody who says that the fact that most of the men are Asian and most of the children are white is not relevant, I mean that’s just fatuous.’ Kabeer Hassan, 25, of Oldham, was jailed for nine years for rape and conspiracy. Abdul Aziz, 41, of Rochdale, was jailed for nine years for conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation. Abdul Rauf, 43, of Rochdale, was jailed for six years for trafficking and conspiracy. Mohammed Sajid, 35, of Rochdale, was jailed for 12 years for conspiracy, rape, sexual activity with a child and trafficking. Adil Khan, 42, of Rochdale, was jailed for eight years for conspiracy and trafficking. Mohammed Amin, 45, of Rochdale, was jailed for five years for conspiracy and sexual assault. Abdul Qayyum, 44, of Rochdale, was jailed for five years for conspiracy.

Labour was last night accused of attempting to hijack a petition calling for new laws to shackle the Press. The petition, launched by the father of Madeleine McCann last week, urges the three party leaders to implement every word of Lord Justice Leveson’s 2,000-page report on press standards. Set up by the Hacked Off protest group, it has been widely portrayed as non-partisan campaign. Petition: Gerry McCann, left, and Christopher Jefferies, right, launch the Hacked Off petition, urging the Government to implement all recommendations made by the Leveson Report . But last night it emerged the Labour Party is using its own resources to mobilise support for the petition. It hopes to force David Cameron to back down on his pledge to protect free speech by shunning Lord Leveson’s call for a state-backed regulator. Today it emerged both the Prime Minister and Lord Justice Leveson have been called to give evidence to a powerful parliamentary committee on his plans for press regulation. The Commons Culture, Media and Sports Committee has launched a new inquiry into press regulation, and hopes that the PM and the Appeal Court judge will be star witnesses. Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt, Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and representatives of the Hacked Off campaign have also been asked to give evidence. Culture Secretary Maria Miller today pleaded for cross-party unity as MPs again clashed on the government’s response to the report. Mr Cameron has made clear he opposes using the law to enforce regulation of the press, defying calls from Labour, Lib Dems and some of his own Tory MPs. As the Commons began a debate on the judge’s report, Mrs Miller warned MPs: ‘We must not allow this debate to polarise us. We all agree on the need for a tough and independent regulator for the press ... we all agree that the suffering of the victims and their families cannot be allowed to happen again. ‘We all agree that the status quo is not an option. It is the responsibility of this House to ensure that whatever is put in place is effective. ‘This is common ground, let us put to one side the politics and let us turn our focus on the principles.’ But Labour’s deputy chairman Tom Watson has said the party would ‘bring to bear every resource’ on the issue. Mr Cameron has grave concerns about state involvement in a regulator and believes the Press should be given the chance to face a tough new regime of independent regulation. Yesterday it emerged that 2,000 editors are ready to sign up to independent regulation in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. Labour support: Both party leader Ed Miliband and Labour's deputy chairman Tom Watson have told their Twitter followers to sign the campaign and Mr Watson has asked all party members to sign . Red Ed's tweet: Labour leader Ed Miliband urges his followers to sign the petition on Saturday . Lord Hunt, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, dismissed claims that legislation was needed to persuade publishers to join a tougher regulatory system. The peer, who will take part in talks between the Prime Minister and newspaper editors tomorrow, said five-year rolling contracts would ensure publications could not ‘walk away’ from a new regime. He said: ‘I have spoken to 120 publishers speaking on behalf of 2,000 editors. They have all told me they will sign up.’ - Ex-Guardian editor Peter Preston . Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday urged his 177,000 Twitter followers to sign the petition. Mr Watson has been authorised to use Labour’s databases to email all party members telling them to back the petition. In an extraordinary message, he told them to persuade family and friends to sign up as well, in the hope of forcing the Prime Minister to reverse his ‘betrayal’. Mr Watson went on: ‘We will bring to bear every resource, call in every promise, rattle every skeleton in every cupboard. This is a step too far by Cameron.’ Making it clear that he sees the petition as a means of launching a Labour Party onslaught on the Prime Minister, Mr Watson continued: ‘Cameron wants to sell out to Rupert Murdoch and powerful press interests because he is scared, and he is weak. But that is why he cannot succeed – because he is weak. And he is wrong.’ No chase: Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt said no legislation was needed to make newspapers sign up to an independent regulation system as 2,000 editors have already pledged to sign up . Yesterday Peter Preston, former Guardian . editor, weighed into the debate. He warned: ‘Of course, everyone has . been very nice to Lord Justice Leveson. But, in truth, this report is a . sloppy, elephantine piece of work that relies on nobody having the time . to read it before taking sides.’ Tory MP Conor Burns said Labour had made a ‘fatal error of judgment’ in calling for the implementation of the report, which civil liberties campaigners have warned raises serious concerns. Mr Burns, a member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, added: ‘It is a huge but characteristic error of judgment on Tom Watson’s part to try and turn a legitimate debate on press regulation into a squalid partisan rant.’ All in law: The petition wants to implement every word of Lord Justice Leveson's 2,000 page report . Fellow Tory committee member Philip Davies said Labour’s involvement would raise questions about the campaign’s independence. He said: ‘It rather undermines the impression that campaigners want to leave that this is a non-party political movement if Labour party members are being agitated to sign this.’ Hacked Off yesterday boasted that its online petition had been signed by more than 100,000 – although critics have questioned the thoroughness of checks to ensure all signatures are genuine. A similar petition on the Government’s website, where all names are checked, has been signed by fewer than 5,000. Hacked Off insisted that the petition remained a ‘cross party’ campaign. A spokesman said Mr Watson had acted ‘on his own initiative’. Labour last night announced it will bring forward its own draft legislation before Christmas to implement Lord Leveson’s proposals, although it is backing away from Mr Miliband’s original insistence that the broadcasting regulator Ofcom should oversee a new system of regulation. Culture Secretary Maria Miller has already ordered officials to draw up a draft Bill, but has warned it will ‘demonstrate our concerns’ that new laws could be amended by MPs to curb free speech. Labour accused her of ‘bad faith’ and said its own proposals could form the basis of a pincer movement with the Lib Dems to force the legislation on to the statute book.","Hacked Off petition wants every word of Leveson's report implemented .

Michael Joseph Jr., known as Blanket. The children wore outfits evoking . their father's famous styles - Paris most strikingly, in a red and black . Thriller-style jacket. Blanket stood stoic and shy, but the older . children smiled and appeared confident in the spotlight. On a stage shaped like a giant glove, . the musicians performed songs from across Jackson's career - from his . childhood with the Jackson 5 through monster solo albums like Thriller . and Bad. Honouring their father: Prince Michael, Blanket and Paris took to the stage in iconic clothing at the Michael Forever Tribute Concert at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . Participants urged fans to ignore the criticism and controversy, and to revel in the celebration of Jackson's musical legacy. 'It's not about the controversy,' said R&B star Ne-Yo, who kicked off the show with a rendition of . Billie Jean, complete with some passable moonwalking. 'It's not about the trial. It's not about his death. It's about celebrating his life. It's about celebrating his music.' The 50,000-strong crowd at Cardiff's . Millennium Stadium did just that, roaring with approval as Jackson's . brothers Marlon, Tito and Jackie - three-fifths of the original Jackson 5 . - took the stage to perform Blame It On the Boogie with British boyband . JLS. Returning to the spotlight: La Toya Jackson honoured her brother . American friends: Cee Lo Green and Ne-Yo crossed the Atlantic and descended on Wales to take part . 'Can you feel his spirit in the house . tonight?' asked Marlon. Judging by the cheers, the fedora hats and the . sequined gloves in the audience, many could. Jackson died in June 2009, at age 50, as he was preparing for a string of comeback concerts in London.

'This is a great counter-act to . that,' said Motown great Smokey Robinson, who gave a soulful rendition . of 'She's Out of My Life.' 'And it gives people something happy to do, . rather than thinking about what's going on in the trial.' Voice of an angel: Leona Lewis performed at the Michael Forever concert with a host of ballerinas joining her . The show mined a rich trove of . Jackson hits. Leona Lewis crooned I'll Be There, Beyonce delivered the . early single I Wanna Be Where You Are and Jamie Foxx performed Rock With . You. 'Tonight is a history lesson,' Foxx told the crowd. 'We're going to cover five decades of greatness.' The concert has divided the King of . Pop's family and followers.

A portrait of controversial Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has been bought by the British National Portrait Gallery, which relies on taxpayers' money to run. Words taken from IRA terrorist Bobby Sands - who famously died in a hunger strike in protest of his treatment as a criminal by British authorities - are inscribed in the image. The London gallery, which is partly funded by grants from the government, has confirmed it has purchased the painting by Cumbrian artist Conrad Atkinson who is a Catholic of Irish descent. Mr Adams has, in the past, insisted he is proud of his association with the IRA terrorist group, but has stopped short of admitting membership of the paramilitary organisation. The portrait of Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, pictured, is to hang in the National Portrait Gallery in London, along with the likes of Margaret Thatcher . His portrait is set to go on display in the gallery, which also has portraits of the likes of Margaret Thatcher. Mr Atkinson said its purchase was a 'really good and important initiative' by the gallery. He said: 'I think they are quite brave to do it. There may well be no controversy but there may well be.' Mr Adams, leader of the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, has been a  key player in the Irish peace process. He has always denied being a member of the IRA. Sinn . Fein - Irish for 'We Ourselves' - used to be widely regarded as the . political wing of the IRA but is now considered completely separate. The party wants to end British rule in Northern Ireland and make Ireland an independent state. But . Mr Adams could soon be sharing a wall space with British politicians . including Lady Thatcher, who was widely disliked by Irish republicans. Mr Adams, left, is set to see his portrait - decorated with the words of hunger striker Bobby Sands, right - on show at the gallery which has confirmed the sale has been approved . Lady . Thatcher was Prime Minister during the 1981 hunger strike in which . Irish-Catholic militant Bobby Sands starved himself to death after . refusing food for 66 days. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1983, three years after the hunger strike which led to the death of IRA militant Bobby Sands . He was protesting his treatment as a criminal rather than a political prisoner by British authorities. His death immediately touched off widespread rioting in Belfast, as young Irish-Catholic militants clashed with police and British Army patrols and started fires. Thatcher was criticised for her . 'uncompromising policies' but it was recently revealed she personally . sanctioned concessions aimed at ending the hunger strike at the Maze . Prison, Long Kesh, but the deal was rejected by the IRA. The death of 10 republican prisoners in . two IRA hunger strikes marked a turning point both for the IRA and Sinn Fein. The portrait of Mr Adams, who was an important figure in the peace process from the 1980s, is made with acrylic, watercolour and oil pastel. It was created when the artist met Mr Adams in . 2007 and 2008 and previously appeared in an exhibition in Belfast’s Grand Opera House. In 1978 the Ulster Museum refused to hang one of the artist's works which commemorated . the victims of Bloody Sunday. A spokesman for the portrait gallery told the Irish Times the sale had just been approved so a date had not yet been set for . its display. He said: 'It’s early days yet as it’s still going through the . process of acquisition.' The London gallery was founded in 1856 . with the aim of using portraits to promote an appreciation and . understanding of people who had made British history and culture. It is said to hold the most extensive . collection of portraits in the world. It relies on grants in aid from the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as donations. It has many images of Lady . Thatcher, as well as portraits of key political figures such as William . Gladstone and royalty such as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. Conrad Atkinson, a Catholic, was born in Cleator Moor, west Cumbria in 1940, and is of Irish descent. He has worked as a teacher and artist throughout his life and uses a varied range of media. He gained degrees from Carlisle College of Art, Liverpool College of Art and the Royal Academy Schools between 1957 and 1965, and later won a Granada Fellowship. Mr Atkinson showcased his work extensively in a variety of different galleries in the 1970s. He has had a great deal of his work shown at solo exhibitions, including in New York, Belfast and London. In 1972 and 1974 he held solo shows at Institute of Contemporary Arts, in 1975 at Belfast Arts Council Gallery, in 1977 at Northern Arts Gallery and many others. His work, which often refers to social or political themes, has often been considered controversial.","'I think they are quite brave to do it', says artist Conrad Atkinson .

'He ain't heavy': Martin Amrising (right) saved his friend Kevin Brockbank's life by landing heavily on his chest when trying to stop him falling off his chair . A man who collapsed and 'died' at work had his life saved when his heart was literally jump-started by a friend who fell on him. Father-of-two Kevin Brockbank, 54, keeled over after suffering a massive heart attack during a coffee break. Colleague Martin Amriding panicked and reached out to grab his friend of 35 years - but as Kevin slumped to the floor he was dragged down with him. Engineer Martin, who weighs 15 stone, fell onto Kevin's chest - and the impact kick-started his heart. Paramedics raced to the scene and rushed Kevin to hospital - where doctors confirmed Martin's fall saved his life. Father-of-two Martin, of Preston, Lancashire, said: 'I saw Kevin was going to fall off his chair so I tried to catch him, but he pulled me right over the chair. 'It was only afterwards that the paramedic told me I had saved his life by falling on him. 'I felt awful when I fell on him because I thought I'd really hurt him - then I found out I'd actually saved his life. 'I was gobsmacked. I still haven't really got my head round what happened. I'm just glad to see he is all right. It wasn't exactly a textbook resuscitation but it seemed to do the trick.' The near-death experience happened at a printing press in Dundee, where both men work as service engineers. Kevin, who lives in Ayr, Ayrshire, said: 'I remember feeling unwell and the next thing I knew I was on the floor with Martin on top of me, which is remarkable in itself because he weighs about 15 stone. 'We were in the canteen having a coffee and a chat when I started to feel unwell and suddenly it felt like I had been hit in the chest by a sledgehammer. 'I could feel my eyes rolling back in my head and I slumped down. I started to fall over so Martin tried to grab me, but I must have dragged him over the chair with me. 'Afterwards I was told my heart had stopped beating for about a minute and both the paramedic and the surgeon said it was the thud of Martin falling on me that saved my life, in the same way CPR chest compressions would. 'It's certainly a strange situation to have been in. But if it hadn't been for Martin falling on me I wouldn't be here.' Martin visited Kevin every day as he recovereda at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital . Lean on me: Kevin (left) has now recovered following further surgery. The near-death experience happened in October at a printing press in Dundee,where Kevin and Martin (right) both work . Kevin suffered four more cardiac arrests in the ambulance but was revived by paramedics following the incident in October. He was taken to Dundee's Ninewells Hospital - where he was visited by Martin every day - and only given a 50 per cent chance of survival. But he underwent an operation to insert a stent in his heart to unblock the main artery and was discharged ten days later. He later suffered two minor strokes and was re-admitted to hospital, where he underwent operations to remove blood clots in his legs, heart and kidneys.

Emily had . been receiving chemotherapy at Phoenix Children's Hospital for about a month when her mother Norma Bracamontes  removed an IV drip from her arm, changed her clothes and walked her out of the facility last Wednesday night. The Hispanic girl was previously forced to have her arm amputated because of an infection, while a catheter was also placed in her heart.

Daytime temperatures in northern England and Scotland could struggle to top 2C (36F) on Wednesday and Thursday, she added, with some isolated spots failing to get above -1C (30F). But by Friday temperatures will have risen, with averages of 10C (50F) in the south and 6C (43F) in the north. Most areas will see rain, though it could fall as sleet or snow on high ground like the Welsh Mountains and the Yorkshire Dales. The wet weather is set to continue into next weekend, with showers especially along the west coast. Meanwhile an amateur astronomer captured rare mother-of-pearl coloured clouds over the UK. The stunning pink formations, known as nacreous clouds, are caused by extreme weather conditions and rarely seen in Britain. Three day forecast: Wintry showers could return to the UK later this week, forecasters say . Graeme Whipps, 49, was stunned when he saw the pearlescent clouds in Chapel of Garioch, near Aberdeen in Northern Scotland yesterday evening. 'I have observed hundreds of aurora above Scotland, but this is the first time in 25 years I’ve seen these beautiful pearlescent clouds,' said Graeme, who works as a meteorologist. Nacreous clouds form in the stratosphere between 10 and 30 miles up and are made up of miniscule ice crystals forming at minus 85 degrees Celsius. They are typically seen in the winter months as the sun sets or rises and are illuminated by the sun’s rays from below the horizon. Frozen stuck: A cow fell into this iced-over swimming pool in Windeck, Germany, and couldn't get out. 'We drained the pool and managed to haul her out using a tractor,' said a fire brigade spokesman . The iridescent colours are due to the ice crystals being of a uniform shape and size and the cloud covering being thin. The sun has to be at just the right angle below the horizon to cause diffraction and interference with the crystals to produce the beautiful colours. Scientists believe the clouds also help accelerate the process of the depletion of the ozone layer. The clouds provide a surface for the chlorine and bromine in CFC’s to react into an active form, which makes the chlorine more destructive to the ozone layer.","The two silver cars are now floating in the River Cam in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, after two separate incidents at the flooded ford .

A popular and 'edgy' high-street retailer is facing a backlash as parents discovered a Christmas brochure full of f-bombs and other unseasonal greetings. Urban Outfitters, which targets teenagers with lifestyle products, has been accused of seeking attention through the use of profanity in the past. And this year's catalog features books, mugs and other gifts emblazoned with swearwords. 'Offensive': Parents are upset that products such as this one are being targeted at their teenage children . The 2012 Christmas range includes a $24 candle proclaiming F**k, a parody of the classic Love sculpture by American artist Robert Indiana. There is a book entitled 'Let’s f***ing reminisce' and a 'It was all f***ing awesome' photo album. The festive catalog contains a mug and wrapping paper stating Merry Christmas b*****s. Also available are several gifts and clothing items with the F-word. Unseasonal greetings: The message on this mug is not very festive . This wrapping paper has the same attitude . Urban Outfitters are hoping that their target audience of teenagers and 20-somethings find the sweary items 'cool' - it certainly isn't the first time the retailer has featured obscene products. The store stocked T-shirts featuring Mitt Romney and the phrase 'Mitt is the s**t' earlier in the year. Monica Cole, director of the American Family Association’s One Million Moms division told Fox News: 'This really isn’t anything new for . them.' 'Their catalog has offensive profanities on products . and little knickknacks, T-shirts -- you name it. And so many teenagers . shop there.'

The AFA have once again requested that Urban Outfitters 'clean up' their website and catalog. No one at Urban Outfitters was available for comment. The advantages of a rude and controversial range are obvious. As Loyola University business professor Joan Phillips, Ph.D. told CBS2: 'It’s a classic segmentation approach.'

Joanna Lumley has revealed that she is a pagan and a believer ‘in the trees’. It is the first time the Absolutely Fabulous actress, who was raised a Christian, has spoken openly about her religious beliefs and spirituality. The 66-year-old made the admission in an interview about The Quest for the Ark, a documentary examining the story of Noah and the flood which she will present for ITV1 this month. The investigation into the origins of the flood story, which features in the three world faiths – Christianity, Islam and Judaism – forced Lumley to confront her own beliefs. ‘I think I’m a pagan, but a believer in all. I kind of believe in the trees. Do you know?’ she said in the interview with Radio Times magazine. ‘I think most of us are curious. Which is why religion is so important to people. We all want to find out “What’s it all about, Alfie?” before we book out completely. ‘I was brought up as a Christian – first in India, in a house which had all these masses of Buddhist images, in a country where Hinduism reigned – and then in the Far East where the call of the muezzin [the Islamic call to prayer] was heard every morning. ‘I’m a fellow traveller with all these faiths, but I haven’t got a personal tradition. ‘The message I would take from the story of the flood as God’s punishment is that we are all responsible for behaving properly on the planet. Look after it, because it could go badly wrong.’ Lumley, who described herself as a Darwinist and ‘not a Creationist’, revealed that she has had a lifelong fascination with the story of Noah and his Ark. ‘I have an idea that when a notion persists throughout the ages and across the globe, it probably contains some fundamental truth. It’s not as simple as “no smoke without fire”. But on the other hand there’s something about the timing of this,’ she said. ‘There have been horrifying floods, some extraordinary climate changes, so now seemed as good a time as any to address the notion of a cataclysmic event. Everything points to the fact that there was a flood alarming enough to be recorded in Sumerian history, which predates the main world religions. ‘So I think that human beings – who are responsible for pretty much everything we know in the way of alteration to the earth – probably made some sense, to their own ends, of a flood that really happened.’ Ab Fab: What would Patsy, played by Lumley (pictured), make of the actresses pagan views?","Absolutely Fabulous actress Joanna Lumley spoke about her spirituality in an interview for an ITV documentary about the story of Noah's Ark .

Rip-off train companies are being ‘totally dishonest’ with passengers on punctuality and must start telling them ‘within just a minute’ when their trains are on time, says Transport Minister Norman Baker. In a damning broadside against major train operators he said passengers – and taxpayers- have a right to consider trains to be late if they fail to meet a much stricter 60 second deadline. Set against that tougher ‘just a minute’ punctuality measure up to a third of trains currently deemed ‘on time’ would be late. Watchdogs said passengers felt ‘ripped off.’ The Transport Minister wants trains to be judged late if one minute has passed since it was due, not 10 minutes as it currently is . Mr Baker wants train companies to tighten up their time-keeping. He is demanding an end to the farce which now allows rail companies up to ten minutes leeway on lateness and still have their trains considered officially punctual. Currently train companies can massage their figures by being allowed to claim officially that their  trains are ‘on time’ if they arrive within five minutes for short-distance and within 10 minutes for long-distance services. This is called the ‘Public Performance measure’ or ‘PPM.’ Allowing just a minute’s leeway is called 'right-time performance.’ But too many train companies are ‘dragging their heels’ in being open with passengers who buy their tickets and taxpayers who subsidise the railways, he said. The broadside and warning of an impending crackdown was launched by Mr Baker after he addressed a ‘Rail Transparency Conference’ organised by the watchdog Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) on Monday. If the new scheme was put in place, up to a third of trains currently deemed 'on time' would be late . Mr Baker, who is fed up with the train companies’ sleight of hand told the Daily Mail afterwards: ‘It is totally dishonest to say trains are punctual when for short distance and journeys they can arrive within 4 minutes and 59 seconds and for long-distance they can be within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still count as being officially on time. Taxpayers and passengers deserve better than this. ‘That is why we are putting pressure on the rail industry to publish proper real-time performance  figures.' Taking his cue from two popular BBC Radio4  comedy series, Mr Baker said: ‘Punctuality should be measured by ‘Just a Minute’, not ‘I’m sorry I haven’t a Clue.’ Latest figures show that under the current system around 9 out of 10 (89.3 per cent) of trains are now officially on time. But under the stricter ‘right time’ counting, this plummets to around 6 out 10 (62 per cent) – a fall of around a third. Under the current system for long-distance operators who have ten minutes’ leeway, Virgin West Coast currently measures just over three-quarters (77.5 per cent ) on time, First Great Western (88.2 per cent), and East Coast (87.4 per cent). But under the stricter measure of trains being late if they are just a minute overdue, the punctuality rate for long-distance trains plummets to just half  (50 per cent) on time. Similarly, punctuality performance for London and regional services is artificially enhanced by the current measure – with Chiltern (93 per cent), c2cRail (97.8per cent), First Capital Connect (87.2 per cent),  First ScotRail (88.7 per cent), Greater Anglia (89.3 per cent), Northern Rail (88 per cent),  South West trains (91.8 per cent), Southeastern (88 per cent), Southern (81.1per cent), and Arriva Trains Wales (93 per cent). But measured under the ‘just a minute’ leeway rules, punctuality for regional services in London and the South East plummets to just 62.7 per cent, and in the rest of the UK (including ScotRail) to 63.4 per cent on time. Currently only broad regional ‘real time’ breakdowns are published. But next week Network Rail will go . further and publish ‘real time’ punctuality figures by individual train . company. These will show wide variation in performance – with some . companies currently considered to be officially ‘punctual’ ending up . ‘late’ when given only 59 seconds leeway. The Transport Minister called train companies 'totally dishonest' when they say a train is within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still counts as being officially on time . And early next year Mr Baker says he intends to publish real time figures for individual train service routes, so rail traveller can see how the train they catch performs in ‘real time.’ He said: ‘People want to know punctual the train they use is. Taxpayers also have a tight to know. ‘It is much better if train companies are as open as possible rather than forcing people to make Freedom of Information requests. The irony is that train punctuality is pretty good  and much better than it has been.’ ORR chairman Anna Walker told the Rail Transparency Conference: ‘We believe that greater transparency in the rail industry can deliver great benefits for passengers, taxpayers, business, and the rail industry itself. ‘Lack of trust breeds suspicion that passengers are being ‘ripped off’ and taxpayers are not getting value from the railways. Customers expect to see more and better information on mobile devices.’ But a spokesman for the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) said: ‘Rail passengers already know far more about how the services they use perform compared to other forms of transport such as road or air travel. ‘We have responded to the government’s wish for further information on performance, despite repeatedly making it clear that the data is not yet reliable.’","Transport minister Norman Baker insists only trains arriving within a minute of their schedule can be classed as on time .

Dorice 'Dee Dee' Moore, 40, was convicted of first-degree murder, after she killed Florida lottery winner Abraham Shakespeare. She became close to Abraham by claiming she was writing a book about him. Shakespeare's body was found under a concrete slab behind a home detectives say was owned by Moore's ex-boyfriend in Hillsborough County. He had been shot twice.

Heartless: Judge Emmett Battles said Moore was 'the most manipulative person' he had ever seen and described her as 'cold, calculating and cruel' Emotional: Shakespeare's sister Linette Williams, center, breaks down in tears during Moore's trial . At the hearing, Moore showed little emotion as the verdict was read, and Judge Emmett Battles said that she was 'the most manipulative person' he had ever seen and described her as 'cold, calculating and cruel.' Moore was also briefly banned from the courtroom over concerns that she may have threatened jurors. She was back a short time . later for closing arguments, but said she did not want to take the stand in . order to protect her family. Moore is accused of killing Shakespeare, of Polk County, in April 2009. He won a $30million lottery jackpot in 2006. Prosecutors said the 40-year-old Moore befriended Shakespeare in late 2008, . claiming she was writing a book about how people were taking advantage of him. They claim Moore later became his financial adviser, eventually controlling . every asset he had left after his death, including an expensive home, the debt owed to him and a . $1.5 million annuity. 'She got every bit of his money,' said Assistant State . Attorney Jay Pruner in closing arguments. 'He found out about it and threatened . to kill her. She killed him first.' Charged: Moore pictured after her arrest in 2010 (left) and her alleged victim, Abraham Shakespeare, a 43-year-old truck driver (right) Hillsborough . Sheriff David Gee alleged that she tried to dodge suspicion by using . Shakespeare's phone to send family members text messages saying he was . OK and also writing letters pretending to be him, according to 10 News. Moore denied the murder and says she took over Shakespeare's assets, about $3.5million and a mansion, authorities say, so he could get away from people pestering him for money. 'The money was like a curse to him. And . now it's become a curse to me,' Moore told reporters in 2010. 'God knows . I would never take another human being's life.' But investigators claim Moore turned to a man called Greg Smith to cover up the crime. Smith was already signed up as a sheriff's informant and was working with detectives to get close to her and gather information. Sheriff Gee alleged Moore trusted him so much that she asked him for help to find a prisoner willing to . take the blame for killing Shakespeare in exchange for $50,000. During jury selection, a pool of 100 prospective jurors was screened yesterday. 10 .

Shakespeare's family reported him missing in November 2009, telling the Polk County sheriff's office they hadn't seen him since April. Speaking at the time, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said when their investigation began they had hoped to find Shakespeare alive. When the body was found, his brother Robert Brown was quoted by 10 News as saying: 'I'm missing my little brother, what ain't gonna be back no more. 'Dead and gone, and everything.

Nick Clegg has called for a major rethink of plans to monitor people’s phone records and internet use. The Deputy Prime Minister ordered Home Secretary Theresa May 'back to the drawing board' after a parliamentary committee expressed ‘serious concerns’ about the so-called snoopers’ charter. MPs and peers accused ministers of using ‘fanciful and misleading’ figures to back up its proposals to give police and security services sweeping powers to access communications data. Coalition clash: Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg seized on 'serious criticisms' by MPs and peers to insist Tory Home Secretary Theresa May rethink her plans to monitor phone and internet use . They said the proposed laws, which would . force internet and phone firms to store masses of information about . emails, phone calls and internet clicks, go much further than is . necessary and amount to overkill. Mr Clegg said that the 'serious criticisms' meant the government’s draft Data Communications Bill must be ripped up. But Mrs May insisted she will 'not allow these vitally important laws to be delayed any longer in this Parliament'. The row triggered one of the most dramatic coalition splits since the controversial Health and Social Care Bill was 'paused' after Lib Dems expressed grave doubts about its contents. Mr Clegg was delighted to find the joint committee of MPs and peers agreed with his concerns about giving police and security services access to phone and internet records. The Deputy PM said: 'Their report makes a number of serious criticisms – not least on scope; proportionality; cost; checks and balances; and the need for much wider consultation. ‘It is for those reasons that I believe the Coalition Government needs to have a fundamental rethink. ‘We cannot proceed with this bill and we have to go back to the drawing board.’ Has caused deep unease: Officials will be able to see the address of every website visited, along with details of Skype phone calls and use of gaming websites . Mrs May insisted however that, while . she would consider the report’s findings, the Government must forge . ahead with the legislation in the current parliament. She reminded the . Lib Dems they had agreed to the inclusion of the law in the strategic . defence review (SDR) of 2010. She . said: ‘This is a Government commitment. It was put in the SDR because . it was recognised this was so important to be able to continue to . protect the UK from a number of threats, including paedophiles and . terrorists.’ Today James Brokenshire, a junior Tory Home Office minister, conceded there was 'workn that needs to be done'. 'There . is a legitimate debate to be had over the balance between security and . individual liberty,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. There . is a gap in what the police is able to do at the moment. We believe . that the changes that meet the substance of [the report's] . recommendations can be made in reasonably short order, but we know that . we need to work this through with the coalition, recognising that the . Deputy Prime Minister has set out his concerns. 'There . are always differences in the coalition, that’s what coalition is all . about. This is about saving lives and protecting the public.' Under the plan, internet and phone . companies will be compelled by law to store the information for a year. It can then be accessed on a case-by-case basis in relation to terrorist . cases or ‘serious crime’. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Julian . Huppert warned: 'It is very, very dangerous once you start collecting . huge amounts of data on literally everybody on the country... that is . incredibly dangerous.' Mr Huppert said many people would be 'uncomfortable' that websites they visited, such as for abortion . providers or marriage counsellors, were logged. He also expressed concerns that the location a text was sent from could be stored. Officials will be able to see the . address of every website visited, along with details of Skype phone . calls and use of gaming websites. They . point out they only want to be able to find out when a call was made . and to whom – not what was said. The idea has caused deep unease among . backbench Lib Dem and Tory MPs, prompting Mr Clegg to demand an inquiry . by the joint parliamentary committee. Yesterday, the MPs and peers broadly accepted the case for some further powers to monitor higher levels of communications data. But, in a highly critical report, they called for the draft bill to be substantially rewritten. They said Mrs May would be given ‘sweeping powers to issue secret notices’ ordering communications companies to disclose ‘potentially limitless’ categories of data. The report found the Government had exaggerated the financial benefits of the £1.8billion proposal. Westminster’s intelligence and security committee, which monitors the work of the security services, said that without the new powers there would be a ‘serious impact’ on the work of MI5 and MI6. But Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This report casts doubt on the security case for such sweeping surveillance powers.’ And Isabella Sankey, director of policy for the campaign group Liberty, said: ‘The Government has been sent back to the drawing board by this cross-party committee. ‘It is clear that a proper public consultation would leave this snoopers’ charter, not just in the long grass, but dead and buried.’ Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert, who sat on the committee, said the bill was ‘far too broad, very expensive, poorly evidenced and potentially unworkable’. Analysis by James Slack . Politicians have been trying to pass new snooping laws for the past four years amid ferocious opposition from civil liberties groups. Jacqui Smith, the authoritarian Labour Home Secretary, failed in 2008 in a bid to introduce a massive database containing details of every internet visit, phone call and email. The Tories and Lib Dems, who opposed the Smith blueprint, then revived the idea two years later. It was included in the government’s strategic defence review (though not the Coalition agreement). Theresa May argues there are crucial differences between the Labour plan and her own. The most important distinction is that the internet and phone companies will keep the data – not a state database which could be abused or hacked. However, the joint committee of MPs and peers says the Home Secretary’s proposal is very similar to the Smith proposal. Her bill would force communications providers to keep databases of emails, phone calls and other data for 12 months. Each database could then be accessed round the clock by the government’s request filter, a computer system available to police and security officials. The MPs and peers say: ‘So the same data is being stored about the same people and it is being stored in databases which are accessible to public authorities given powers under the bill. ‘The difference is that instead of one database there are many and they are privately owned. Difficult position deciding what to next: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper issued a lengthy statement which failed to say whether the Opposition would back or oppose the bill . Although they are privately owned the . government can stipulate what should be held on them, for how long, and . in what format it should be supplied. ‘The . differences therefore are not as great as the Home Office suggests; the . request filter can be equated to a federated database.’ To . give an example of the scope of these powers, the report says it would . be possible for the authorities to use the filter to ‘list all persons . who are the designated user of a mobile phone that was in London (eg . Trafalgar Square) at time (eg noon last Tuesday)’. When deciding how much they want the draft bill to be amended, MPs will doubtless have the request filter in their sights. But . both the Lib Dems and Labour are in a difficult position when deciding . what steps to take next. Last night, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper . issued a lengthy statement which failed to say whether the Opposition . would back or oppose the bill. Their problem is that they have supported an even tougher version of the legislation in government so would appear opportunistic if they voted against now. Mr Clegg, meanwhile, is confronted by the fact that the joint committee – while scathing over the detail of the draft bill – accepted the principle that some new snooping powers are needed. He is likely to demand significant concessions, while stopping short of demands from his party to ditch the bill. The legislation does not have implications for the Data Protection Act, which covers personal information which police can hold about a person. Communications data is currently governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which would be updated by the draft bill.","MPs and peers accuse ministers of using 'misleading' figures in bid to give police and security services access to communications data .

Shoppers in Britain face one of the highest levels of sales tax and duty in the world, a study has revealed. It says that with families unable to afford goods and services, the country will struggle to escape from the economic doldrums. Experts put together a basket of goods, from a box of chocolates to an iPad, as well as an energy bill and a litre of petrol, to assess the average sales tax faced by families. Expensive: Shoppers in Britain face one of the highest levels of sales tax and duty in the world . The UK figure was 15.97 per cent, which is more than the average of 13.8 per cent across the 22 countries surveyed by the accountants UHY Hacker Young. It was also higher than the European average of 15.5 per cent, 12.3 per cent in the G8 group of the world’s wealthiest nations, and 8.2 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region. Among the leading Western nations, only the Netherlands had a higher average sales tax rate at 18.18 per cent. In Britain, VAT of 20 per cent on an item translates as a  sales tax of 16.7 per cent of  the purchase price. For example, a product worth £1 would carry VAT of 20p, selling for £1.20. This means the buyer pays 20p of the £1.20 as sales  tax – which is 16.7 per cent.  Despite the cancellation of a fuel duty increase in last week’s Autumn Statement, some 57.7 per cent of the cost of petrol is made up from tax. This compares with 22.1 per cent in the US, and the international average of 36.22 per cent. Tobacco taxes are also particularly high in Britain, making up 76.8 per cent of the price of a pack of cigarettes, compared with 21.5 per cent in the US. The figure is 73 per cent in Germany, but a higher 80.2 per cent in Ireland and France. Simon Newark of UHY  Hacker Young said: ‘Like all countries with high sales  taxes, the UK’s sales and consumption taxes are holding back the economy by putting pressure on disposable incomes. ‘VAT in the UK is now higher than even traditionally higher-taxing economies like Germany, where VAT is 19 per cent, and even France, where VAT is 19.6 per cent. ‘The UK also compares badly with other major economies like Australia.’ He added: ‘High sales and consumption taxes will have a particularly heavy impact on low earners, especially if they are on “necessity” goods like petrol.’","British shoppers face one of the highest levels of sales tax in the world .

A petrol-bomb attack on a policewoman was yesterday being treated as attempted murder. A gang of around 15 men surrounded the unmarked car as the officer sat inside, smashed its windows and threw in the bomb. Following the incident, the worst in more than a week of disorder in Belfast, the Northern Ireland Secretary attacked Loyalist mobs for ‘dishonouring and shaming’ the Union Flag. A police patrol car sits burnt outside Alliance Party MP Naomi Long's office in east Belfast, Northern Ireland after being attacked by a masked gang of men with a petrol bomb . A forensic officer works around a burnt out the unmarked police car. About 15 masked men smashed the windows of the police car and threw a petrol bomb into it while an officer was still inside, police said . An unmarked police car was also paint bombed . MPs united to condemn the outbreak of . violence, which began after the number of days the British flag flies . above Belfast City Hall was cut. The woman officer was guarding the . Belfast offices of Alliance Party MP Naomi Long, who had received a . death threat after her cross-community party backed the controversial . move to reduce the number of days on which the flag was flown. The woman officer escaped unhurt but . the attack, on Monday, was one of several incidents across the province . which police said were being ‘stoked’ by social media. Yesterday Theresa Villiers told MPs: . ‘There is nothing remotely British about what they are doing; they are . dishonouring and shaming the flag of our country with their lawless and . violent activities.' Thirty-two police officers have been hurt and 38 people charged since the violence began. Rioters gathered at Broadway Roundabout following a protest over the decision by Belfast City Council to stop flying the union flag every day . PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George . Hamilton said the officer was lucky to escape with his life outside the . MP's office on the Newtownards Road. Officers were also attacked with petrol bombs in south Belfast close to the M1 motorway. He . said: 'This was a planned attempt to kill a police officer which also . put the lives of the public in danger and it is fortunate there were no . injuries.' Peter Robinson, . the Northern Ireland First Minister and leader of the Democratic . Unionist Party had talks in Belfast with Mike Nesbitt, leader of . the Ulster Unionist Party to try to agree some sort of agreed political . strategy in a bid to ease tensions and end the violence on the streets. They . have been heavily criticised by nationalist representatives over their . leadership since the trouble first flared a week ago. The trouble followed a council decision to limit the flying of the Union flag to designated days only. Ms Long's Alliance Party has been blamed by the loyalists for supporting the nationalist SDLP and Sinn Fein in pushing through the vote to lower the flag. There were also protests  in Limavady, Co Londonderry, Ballyclare, Co Antrim, Ballycastle, Co Antrim and Cookstown, Co Tyrone where the car of a DUP member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Ian McCrea, was surrounded by loyalist who were angry at his presence. Several roads in Belfast were blocked and at one stage police were also attacked with petrol bombs and fireworks at Broadway, not far from the M1 motorway. Last week Ms Long was told by police to stay away from her home and her office on the Newtownards Road because of fears for her safety. Constituency offices used by the party were also attacked in Carrickfergus, Co Antrim and Bangor, Co Down. Mr Robinson and Mr Nesbitt have already called for loyalist restraint, and according to a statement tonight they agreed to work on a 'joint basis with a view to urgently bringing forward political proposals to address widespread concerns across the community.'","Gang of men tossed petrol bomb in unmarked vehicle .

Tragic: Senior bank manager Michael Foreman, 48, died when he fell 100ft from the Tate Modern . A senior bank manager with a fear of heights plunged 100 feet to his death from a private members' balcony at the Tate Modern while four times over the drink drive limit. Michael Foreman, 48, had been drinking wine in the art gallery's bar for an hour before he was seen striding determinedly toward the railing and plunging off the London building from the balcony on the fifth floor. A coroner returned an open verdict after he heard that there was no sign given to the family of the impending tragedy and his judgement would have been impaired by alcohol. His father Stephen told Southwark Coroners Court: 'He lived an ordinary life, he was a very particular sort of person, he wanted to do everything correctly in the right way and that is how he went on in life until as far as we know that last moment. 'He showed no sign of distress or anxiety at all and to this moment how this happened, and in particular why this happened, is a complete mystery to us and to the rest of his family in company with everybody who knew him. 'It is completely indescribable what has happened and he gave no indication as to anything untoward that would lead to such a set of circumstances.' Mr Foreman, who was not a regular visitor to the Tate but worked next door, was reported missing by HSBC on July 23, the court heard. On July 24 he was seen sitting in the members bar of the Tate Modern drinking wine for roughly an hour by staff before they began closing the terrace. Friends Victoria Young and Josephine Kelly were the only other people left outside when the suited man strode up to them, climbed over the railings and fell to his death. Ms Young said she saw him take a couple of strides 'as though he was taking a run up' before he jumped. She said: 'He appeared very determined, there was no way anyone could have stopped him.' Paramedics who rushed to the scene could see it was too late to attempt resuscitation. The post mortem found he had 300mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood - four times the drink drive limit - which the coroner noted would have left him 'unsteady' and with 'poor judgement'. Awful: The 48-year-old had been drinking wine in the art gallery's bar for an hour before he was seen striding determinedly toward the railing and plunging off the Tate Modern, pictured . His wife Janet, who also works at HSBC, said he was a very 'private man' who worked hard and enjoyed his hobbies, and they had no problems or arguments and a 'good family life'. He was a trombonist in the Tilbury brass band in Essex, where they lived together, and also used to play regularly with The Aveley and Newham Band in east London and was looking forward to appearing on a TV show with the band. When she heard he was dead she was 'absolutely shocked' and she could think of 'absolutely nothing' which would have prompted him to jump. Mrs Foreman said: 'It was not in his character at all to have done something like that to himself, especially since he didn't like heights, if he went to the edge of a building he would get dizzy.' Mr Foreman, who had no history of mental illness, had not left a note, sent a text message or given any indication of what was about to happen. Grim: Police and forensics officers are seen at the Tate Modern following the death of Michael Foreman . 'It was not in his normal character or personality that meant he would even consider disappearing then taking his own life in such a dramatic way,' she told the court. He died during a busy period for the gallery with shows by artists Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch taking place. A statement from his boss Nadya Hijazi, Head of Global Interactive E-channels at HSBC, said he was doing well at work and was being praised and receiving good bonuses to confirm his success. Mr Hijazi added: 'Not only was he highly respected by his colleagues and managers but well liked by all. He will be sadly missed by all his colleagues both professionally and personally.' Coroner Andrew Harris noted that 'too all intents and purposes he had a happy life', adding in his verdict 'he was under the influence of alcohol and there is no evidence of intent or suspicious circumstances'.

Boston University photojournalism pupil Christopher Weigl, from Southborough in Massachusetts, died on Thursday after colliding with the vehicle in Commonwealth Avenue, Boston. In September the 23-year-old, who was the fifth cyclist to be killed in a road traffic accident in the city this year, wrote his own obituary as part of a class assignment. In the obituary the former eagle scout, spoke about his passion for photography and love for the outdoors lifestyle. He said that 'he cemented his love for photojournalism' during a trip to southeast Asia after finishing at Skidmore College. The accomplished clarinet player gained the opportunity after enlisting with the volunteer organisation Operation Groundswell. He was given  the chance to uncover stories and assist with projects in both Cambodia and Thailand. According ABC News his professor described Mr Weigl as 'the ideal student: smart, mature, curious.' Police are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr Weigl's death, but friends and relatives have paid warm tributes to the 'motivated but fun-loving man. Mr Weigl was completing an accelerated one-year master’s photojournalism program at Boston University, and, in addition to past internships with magazines and photographers, he had already compiled an impressive portfolio of international work on his website. His close friend Dan Herard said Mr Weigl was a modest but talented individual : 'He was so good at photography, but he didn’t rub it in your face or brag.

Trottier Middle School Principal Keith Lavoie, who taught Mr Weigl, said it was obvious from a young age that Mr Weigl was going to aspire to great things. One of his professors, Mitchell Zuckoff, gave Mr Weigl the obituary writing assignment on the first day of a feature writing class. According to the Boston Globe Zuckoff says he uses the assignment to give students the opportunity to express themselves and for him to find out more about those he is going to teach. Of course he never envisaged that the obituary would be used so soon after it was written.

Bobby Petrino, the star coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks football team, was fired Tuesday after a horrific motorcycle crash revealed his affair with a 25-year-old staffer. Officials say he handpicked Jessica Dorrell, a former volleyball player at the university, for a $55,735 a year job with the football program and also gave her $20,000 cash during their relationship. Because he was fired for misconduct, Petrino, 51, forfeits his $3.53 million salary and $18 million he would have received for early termination. He is married with four grown children. It's unknown how his wife, Becky, plans to respond to the affair. Dorrell is also in a relationship. She is engaged to Josh Morgan, a swimming coach at the university, and has a wedding scheduled for June. New information: Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino (left) hired his mistress, Jessica Dorrell (right) for a $55,000-a-year job with the football program, picking her out of 159 candidates . Laying low: Jessica Dorrell has stayed out of sight since the Arkansas football coach's motorcycle wreck occurred on April 1 . Petrino never disclosed his conflict of interest in hiring Dorrell or the payment to her, athletic director Jeff Long said. And he ignored multiple chances to simply come clean. 'He . made the decision to mislead the public, (and it) adversely affected . the university and the football program,' Long said, choking up at one . point as he discussed telling players that their coach was gone. There . was a 'pattern of misleading and manipulative behaviour to deceive me.' Petrino hired Dorrell for a job with . his football program that started March 28, four days before the fateful . motorcycle accident in rural Arkansas. Jilted: It's unknown how Bobby Petrino's wife, Becky, plans to handle the revelation of her husband's affair . She was previously for the first . female fundraiser for the Razorbacks Foundation, the charitable arm that . raises money fro the university's athletics program. He picked her out of 159 candidates in a time frame 'shorter than our normal affirmative action hiring process,' Long said. He never disclosed the conflict of interest. Additionally, Long revealed, Petrino gave the woman a $20,000 cash 'gift.' The details of the payment are unknown. Long wouldn't say whether Dorrell was still employed or what her future with the university would be. Also unknown is the status of her relationship with her fiance, Mr Morgan. He has been with the university's swimming and diving team for two years as an assistant to the head coach. Dorrell has gone into hiding after the affair went public. 'She's in safe mode right now,' a former volleyball teammate said. 'Everyone has made mistakes. Everyone has dirty laundry, but not everyone has their dirty laundry shown on national television.' Petrino's firing was yet another abrupt end for the coach, who had built Arkansas into a Southeastern Conference and national power over four seasons, including a 21-5 record the past two years. But Long made it clear that the success on the field was overshadowed by repeated deceptive acts and that no one was more important than the program itself. Long said Petrino was fired 'with cause' – meaning he will not receive a multimillion-dollar buyout – and there were no discussions about ways to keep Petrino at Arkansas. Long declined comment when asked about Dorrell's job status. Engaged: Dorrell and Josh Morgan, an assistant to the Arkansas swim team coach, have a wedding slated for June . Athletic star: Dorrell was a volleyball player at Arkansas and a fundraiser for the Razorbacks Foundation before Petrino hired her . Petrino finishes his tenure at Arkansas with a 34-17 record in four seasons, leading the Razorbacks to a No. 5 final ranking last season and a Cotton Bowl win over Kansas State. The April 1 accident left him with four broken ribs, a cracked vertebra in his neck and numerous abrasions on his face. The avid motorcycle rider said the sun and wind caused him to lose control on the windy two-lane highway about 20 miles southeast of Fayetteville. What he failed to mention, both at a news conference and to Long, was the presence of Dorrell.That revelation was made public when the state police released the accident report. Petrino informed Long of Dorrell's presence 20 minutes before the police released the report to the public, also admitting to what he called a previous inappropriate relationship with Dorrell. Long placed Petrino on paid leave later that night, saying he was disappointed in Petrino and promising to review the coach's conduct. He said his review found that the relationship between the two had lasted a 'significant' amount of time. As the review continued, the state police released the audio of the 911 call reporting Petrino's accident. It revealed Petrino didn't want to call police following the crash, and a subsequent police report showed he asked police if he was required to give the name of the passenger during the accident. Better days: Petrino, centre, seen during a game in January . Petrino was forthcoming about Dorrell's name and presence with police, but only after misleading both Long and the public during his news conference. That led to the school releasing a statement from Petrino's family the day after the accident that said 'no other individuals' were involved. The proved not to be the case and the fracture in trust, along with questions about Dorrell's hiring by Petrino to be the school's student-athlete development coordinator, proved to be too much for Petrino to overcome in Long's eyes. Petrino took the school to its first BCS bowl game following the 2010 season, losing in the Sugar Bowl to Ohio State, and improved his win total in every year. Arkansas was 5-7 his first season in 2008, 8-5 the second before finishing 10-3 and 11-2 during his last two seasons. The coach's tenure with the Razorbacks began under a cloud of national second-guessing following his departure from Atlanta 13 games into the 2007 season. His tenure with the Falcons was the shortest for a non-interim coach since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger. His departure was so sudden that Petrino left farewell notes in the lockers of the Atlanta players rather than telling them of his resignation in person. He was introduced later that night as the new coach of the Razorbacks, carrying with him a vagabond image after holding 15 jobs for 11 different programs/organizations in 24 seasons.","Horrific motorcycle crash that left Petrino in a neck brace revealed his affair with Jessica Dorrell .

Missing: Christine Marie Tessier disappeared from a San Antonio motel in 2005 and has never been seen again . Convicted child murderer Jack McCullough hid a dark family secret while awaiting trial for the abduction and killing of seven year old Maria Ridulph. Ex-cop McCullough, 72, was convicted last week of murdering the child in 1957, as prosecutors successfully wrapped up one of the oldest child abduction cases in US history. But the Mail Online can exclusively reveal McCullough's own daughter is missing -- and it's not known if she's dead or alive. In a bizarre twist that sheds more light on the convicted killer's complicated family history, his daughter Christine Marie Tessier is missing without trace since 2005. McCullough changed his name to John Tessier, taking his mother's maiden name some time after he broke up with his first wife, Sonia. He also has a son he has not seen in many years. Maria's brother claims he has been told McCullough is suspected of having some involvement in his daughter's disappearance. Police in Illinois who investigated Maria's murder referred questions to Texas, where the then 34-year-old Christine Tessier disappeared. Detectives in San Antonio were unable last night to confirm whether McCullough was ever looked at or questioned in connection with the disappearance. But Charles Ridulph, 11 at the time of his little sister's abduction, said he was told by the local DeKalb State's Attorney's office that McCullough's daughter had disappeared. 'I think it's a sad, sad situation that he was not arrested and confined long before this because I am certain there are other victims over these many years,' Mr Ridulph said. 'I have no doubt whatsoever. As a matter of fact his own daughter is missing and he's suspected of having something to do with that. Cold case: Jack McCullough's conviction in Maria Ridulph's 1957 abduction closes one case, but the matter of his missing daughter remains open . Historic: The disappearance of little Maria captivated and horrified the nation for 55 years . 'I think that's the real tragedy here and even in his older years I believe it is important for him to not be allowed to have any contact with the public. I believe he needs to remain in custody for the rest of his life.' Christine Tessier was last seen at a motel in San Antonio in June 2005. She was last seen with a boyfriend. She is listed as endangered missing, meaning police fear she may be dead. Jack McCullough's wife Sue, who is adamant her husband had nothing to do with the murder of Maria, said he had no physical contact with his daughter for many years. 'She was into drugs. She left her kids with her mother and took off and that's the last anyone heard of her. Her boyfriends were of very bad quality.' Suspicious: Maria's brother, Charles Ridulph, says authorities suspect McCullough of being involved in his daughter' disappearance . He spoke on the phone with her and at one point she planned to come to Seattle, Washington, where they lived but it never happened. And in connection with the murder of Maria, Sue McCullough declared: 'Jack did not do this.' Mrs McCullough, unable to see her husband since he was first arrested in July 2011 and taken to Illinois for trial, believes McCullough did not stand a chance of being acquitted. 'He's got proof he was in Chicago. He was getting a military exam. A colonel and two sergeants gave affidavits that they had seen Jack this time, this time and the other time. 'Jack never had a chance. They would not let any of the evidence that said where he was.' Five affidavits taken by the FBI at the time, which placed McCullough far from the murder scene, were ruled inadmissible by Judge James Hallock. In her very first ever interview, Mrs McCullough said: 'I know a person does not change. They don't kill somebody and say oh that was fun but I will never do it again. He does not even kill bugs, he takes them outside. 'He has already been gone for 14 months. He's an old guy and he does not have many years to screw around with this. My only thing is trying to get Jack home.' But Charles Ridulph said: 'Regarding his conviction when I was given the details of the state's case early on I never had any doubt that this was in fact the person who had kidnapped and murdered and murdered my sister. 'However because of the age of this case we were cautioned from the very beginning by the State's Attorney and many others that it would certainly be a hard case to prove but as time went on and the pieces began to fall into place I did not have any doubt that he would be convicted.' Key to the prosecution case was a death bed statement by McCullough's mother, Eileen Tessier. His half sister testified that her mother identified McCullough as Maria's killer. Also helping to convict McCullough was Maria's best friend at the time, who picked the pensioner out of a photo line up as the same young man named Johnny who was last seen with the young girl ahead of her disappearance. And the judge also took into account the evidence of three inmates who claimed McCullough confessed to them while awaiting trial. Sue McCullough said another half sister, in the room when the confession was made, did not hear anything. She also questioned how the friend was able to identify her husband after 55 years as the same person as a teenager and dismissed altogether the testimony of the jailhouse snitches. But McCullough opted for a bench trial, before a judge alone, without a jury. His wife said: 'We thought, wrongly of course, that because the judge had seen all five affidavits that he could not in good conscience convict someone who did not do anything.'","Jack McCullough was convicted last week of the murder and abduction of Ridulph, age 7, in Illinois .

The birds were rescued from the fire at Home Farm, in Mitcheldean, Gloucestershire, shortly after 4.30am today. The blaze is believed to have been caused by an electrical fault in the barn. Rescued: Bill Hurst (pictured), father of the owner of Home Farm, helped firefighters and neighbours rescue the turkeys by hand in the early hours of this morning . Fire: The blaze at Home Farm, Mitcheldean, is believed to have been caused by an electrical fault in the barn . Fire station commander Dave Pike said the turkeys, which had been sleeping in a section of the barn near hay bales and agricultural machinery, were all safely accounted for. But he said their brush with death was unlikely to spare them from the dinner table this Christmas. He said: 'I understand the birds had been readied for Christmas, and I don't think this morning's incident is really going to change that. 'They were corralled to a safe place elsewhere on the farm, and all are doing fine. 'But, as I understand it, they are still due to be slaughtered.' Firemen, with the help of the farm owner and neighbours safely transferred all of the turkeys by hand to a nearby pen. Initially two fire appliances from Cinderford community fire station were sent to the scene with a total of 12 firefighters, but a further 4 crews were called as the blaze took hold. Distinguished: The turkeys had been sleeping in a section of the Home Farm, Gloucestershire barn near hay bales and agricultural machinery, and were all safely accounted for . Watch Commander Andy Fitt said: 'We did feel a little sorry for them as they will still all be for the chop. 'They have all been pre-ordered and paid for, so there will be no reprieve, sadly.' The fire service said the barn contained 50 tons of hay, one tractor and one combine harvester, all severely damaged in the blaze. There were no injuries. Mr Pike added: 'We get called to farm fires from time to time, and usually we deal with pigs and sheep suffering from the effects of fire. 'It was slightly unusual for us to deal with turkeys, but the crews did a bootiful (sic) job.'

The girl, who was the youngest child in the group, was 11. None of the children were injured or forced into the car, said Captain Scott Grant with the Lancaster Police Department. Busted: William Trey Benton, 33, was caught driving with four kids in the trunk of his car . Benton, 33, was charged with child endangerment, driving under suspension, operating an uninsured motor vehicle and possession of stolen property. Police noticed Benton driving his red Ford Crown Victoria in and out of parking spaces along the street when they pulled him over. The license plate did not match the one assigned to the vehicle, according to the police report. At least two of the children found the trunk were Benton's children, police said. The car was filled with other passengers as well.

Benton told local news station WBTV on Monday that he is a ‘good, church-going guy who would never do anything to intentionally hurt his children.’ He said he was leaving the parade with more people than could fit into his car. He said the stolen license plate issue has to do with a family argument, where he believes someone put the plate on the vehicle and then called the police to report it as retaliation.","When officers arrested William Trey Benton, 33, for driving without a stolen license plate, the trunk of the car opened and three boys and one girl stepped out.

Cape Elizabeth schools superintendent Meredith Nadeau said it's unclear whether the students who ate the cookies knew they contained marijuana . 'High' school: Nine students were suspended for bringing marijuana-laced cookies to a Cape Elizabeth High School event - and sickening some classmates . Cookie monsters: The pot-lace treats, like the ones seen here, were brought to the school during a day-long event focused on ethics and values . Some of them felt ill and went to the nurse's office. The Portland Press Herald reported that the episode unfolded on Friday during a daylong event featuring speakers addressing the school district's guiding values of 'Community, Academics, Passion and Ethics (CAPE).' School policy calls for a student who distributes or sells drugs to be suspended for 10 days and face possible expulsion, an action requiring a hearing before the School Board. The names of the students aren't being released. In charge: Superintendent Meredith Nadeau, pictured, said it's unknown whether students who ate the cookies knew they contained pot . The school was the site of another marijuana controversy in 2010, when a boy was kicked out after he sold a pot brownie to a classmate, according to the Press Herald. The student suffered from an extreme case of buyer's remorse when he was carted to a hospital emergency room after eating the brownie. The latest pot cookie case came on the same day that two University of Colorado at Boulder students were accused of bringing marijuana-laced brownies to a college class, sickening their unsuspecting professor and five classmates. Thomas Cunningham, 21, and Mary Essa, 19, were arrested on Saturday on suspicion of second-degree assault, fraudulently inducing the consumption of a controlled substance and conspiracy charges, university police spokesman Ryan Huff said. Huff said three of those who ate the brownies were hospitalized, suffering from the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active property in marijuana. 'If someone views this as a prank, it's no laughing matter,' Huff told Reuters.

Bob Bashara, the Michigan businessman who ordered a hit on the hit man he allegedly hired to murder his wife, was sentenced to up to 20 years in prison Monday morning. Bashara pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of murder, after he admitted that he hired Steve Tibaudo, a local furniture store owner, to find someone to kill Joseph Gentz, the man who killed his wife in January. Gentz testified that Bashara hired him to kill his wife, but authorities have yet to find enough evidence to link him directly to those allegations. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Businessman Bob Bashara was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years for soliciting hit man to murder the man he allegedly hired to kill his wife . Emotional: In court, Bashara tearfully apologized for what he did and said that he has accepted his punishment . In court, Bashara apologized for what he did and said that he has come to accept the punishment being handed down by the court. ‘I apologize to this court,’ he said, reading from a statement. ‘I apologize to Mr Gentz. I apologize to my family and friends.’ He added: 'I certainly do not deny that it was difficult for me to come to the . decision to plead guilty and subject myself to certain prison sentence, . but I recognize that's what I had to do. Throughout my life, I . have tried to help those less fortunate than myself and have worked . tirelessly and I know that I have thrown all of the respect that I build . in 40 years of helping people away.' Bashara occasionally paused to wipe tears away from his face, and when the sentence was read to him, he shook his head. He was joined by his mother and other family members in court. Meanwhile, Gentz told the court through his lawyer that Bashara was behind his actions and that he had threatened to kill him. ‘I have been telling the truth from the beginning,’ his lawyer read from his statement. ‘Bob has used me and threatened me. He told me he had friends in the mafia and would have me killed.’ Gentz admitted strangling Jane Bashara earlier this year but said he was doing it at the direction of her husband. Bashara denies these claims and authorities have still not been able to charge him in connection with her murder. In July, furniture and appliance store owner Steve Tibaudo testified . that Bashara offered him $2,000 to try and find someone to kill Gentz in the . William Dickerson Detention Facility in Hamtramck, where he has been since March. Confession: Bashara said, 'In June of 2012, I foolishly and . regrettably offered to pay Steve Tibaudo to find someone to kill Joseph . Gentz' Strangled: Jane Bashara, left, was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 - eight miles away from their Grosse Point Park home - a day after her husband Bob, right, reported her missing . Tibaudo wore a wire and recorded their conversations for police, according to ABC. Bashara read a statement in Wayne County Court in October admitting to the murder-for-hire plot. 'In June of 2012, I foolishly and regrettably offered to pay Steve . Tibaudo to find someone to kill Joseph Gentz,' he said. Jane Bashara was found on January 25 strangled in her luxury SUV, which had been dumped in an east side Detroit alley. The lawyer for his mistress Rachel . Gillett said the woman has gone into hiding, as she fears she could be . Bashara's next target, according to ABC News. Attorney Doraid Elder said: 'She was happy that he was in jail but mortified when she found out why he was in jail.' Defense attorney Susan Reed, left, defendant Joe Gentz, center, and defense attorney William Winters III appear in 36th District Court in Detroit on Thursday October 4 . Court: Bob Bashara, 54, of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, was charged with solicitation to murder trying to make a hit against a man he allegedly hired to kill his wife . Prosecutors said at his arraignment in June that Bashara spent two weeks trying to arrange to have Gentz killed as the handyman waited in jail court hearings on the case of Jane Bashara's death. Worthy said at the arraignment: 'The evidence will show that Mr Bashara wanted Mr Gentz killed because he ... didn't want him to testify in any future proceedings, should there be any.' Prosecutors also said Bashara approached a second individual to kill Gentz. While police have long considered Bob Bashara a person of interest in his wife’s murder, he has not been charged in her death. Gentz also faces charges of conspiracy, an indication that authorities believe more than one person was involved. Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to Detroit . Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars . Since his wife’s murder, Bob Bashara has vehemently denied being involved, but Gentz tells a different story, saying Bashara promised him money and a used car if Gentz killed Mrs Bashara. In an email to Ohio’s The News-Herald, Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney spokeswoman Maria Miller said: '[The case is] still under investigation’. However, the paper reports that word from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office indicate Bashara will be brought in either this week or next week to face charges. In an appearance on Good Morning America in February, Bashara, with his daughter Jessie proclaimed his innocence in the case. In the meantime, The News-Herald reported that Bashara has collected about 24 letters from character witnesses to use in court if he’s charged with the murder in an effort to secure a release from jail on bond. He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. And I'm innocent. 'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all the negativity, I'm going to have to live through'. Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home in February and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area. Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month when he was charged for his role in Jane Bashara's murder . Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago. On the day of Jane's memorial service, Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 to have done. But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.' The businessman said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home. Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place. The local businessman admitted he and Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money from  Jane before getting into a struggle with her. Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, Mr Bashara was said to be having a relationship with a woman who he was planning on buying a house with . Her husband told police that Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'. 'I do believe he's the one that did it. He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's capable of it,' Bashara said. It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Bashara was the mastermind behind it all. Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Mr Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge. A Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there. She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls. 'They are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might have been hidden cameras, things like that'. Sources confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that Mr Bashara had been drinking at the Hard Luck Lounge the night his wife was murdered.

The crowning spire of the World Trade Center's tallest building has arrived in New York City after a 1,500-mile journey from Canada. A barge carrying nine pieces of the steel spire that will top One World Trade Center in lower Manhattan was brought across New York Harbor on Tuesday from New Jersey's Port Newark, where it arrived from Canada. Meanwhile, workers on the 104-story skyscraper were busy pouring concrete that will hold the 408-foot spire. Scroll down for video . Arrival: Sections of the crowning 408-foot spire for One World Trade Center arrive on a barge on the Hudson River . Finishing pieces: The barge is carrying nine pieces of steel that will eventually top off the new World Trade Center at a symbolic 1,776 feet, making it the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere .

The heaviest piece . weighs nearly 70 tons. The spire is expected to rise into the Manhattan sky by spring. Plate says the 1,776-foot high-rise — symbolizing America's freedom — will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. Completion of the building is scheduled for the end of 2013. Delivery of the antenna had been in . jeopardy due to a legal dispute between the Port Authority of New York . & New Jersey and Canadian manufacturer ADF Steel that was eventually . resolved in October. In a lawsuit filed at the New York Supreme Court, the Port Authority accused ADF of holding the antenna ‘hostage’ in a bid to receive $6 million it claimed it was owed from another WTC-related project. There was a race against time to resolve the dispute before the onset of winter that could have delayed delivery of the antenna until next spring at the earliest. Jeopardy: Delivery of the antenna had been in jeopardy due to a legal dispute between the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey and Canadian manufacturer ADF Steel that was eventually resolved in October . The Atlantic Salvor barge made a 1,500-mile journey from Valleyfield, Quebec carrying the antennae pieces . Beacon of hope: One World Trade Center - the lit-up building on the left - is currently New York City's tallest skyscraper . Typically the St. Lawrence river . freezes during the winter and if ADF hadn’t shipped the giant antenna . parts by December, delivery would probably have been delayed and the March completion date of the tower would have been at risk. That . would have had serious implications for the scheduled opening of One . World Trade Center and  would also have resulted in the layoff of 100 . iron workers who will construct the antenna from the 18 separate . segments. The barge left . Valleyfield, Quebec, in mid-Novemver loaded with the nine largest . sections of the spire which range from five to 67 tons. The remaining 10 . smaller sections are being transported via road. Height: As the building's spire will no longer be enclosed, it may instead have to be classified as a simple antenna which, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, cannot be included in a building's official height . Once . these separate elements have been welded together into the 408-foot antenna, . which cost $10 million, will be placed on top of . the soon-to-be-completed WTC building. The antenna, designed in collaboration with artist Kenneth Snelson, is part of the tower’s 'crown' and will allow the building to reach a symbolic height of 1,776 feet, a nod to the year the U.S. declared its independence from Great Britain. The skyscraper is intended to serve as a ‘symbol of recovery’ after the original towers, which collapsed during the 2001 September 11 terrorist attacks. One World Trade Center, left, is scheduled to be completed next year when it will be determined if it really is taller than the Willis Tower in Chicago . Once completed, One World Trade . Center had been expected to formally become the tallest building in the . Western Hemisphere, surpassing the Willis Tower (formerly known as the . Sears Tower) in Chicago. However in May, plans were dropped to enclose the antenna with an ornamental white shell after it was claimed it would be too costly . and dangerous to maintain. As . the building's spire will no longer be enclosed, it may instead have to . be classified as a simple antenna which, according to the Council on . Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, cannot be included in a building's . official height. Without the inclusion of the antenna . mast, One World Trade Center's official height would be its roof height . of 1,318 feet, making it only the third-tallest building in the United . States, behind the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel & . Tower, both located in Chicago. Even without the spire, the . still-under-construction World Trade Center has already eclipsed the . Empire State Building’s 1,250 feet to make it the tallest building in . New York.

The basketball rivalry between these Kentucky schools is so intense, even the mascots were duking it out on the court. The mascots from Louisville Male High School and duPont Manual High School were supposed to pretend to fight at halftime, but the staged bout turned into a no-holds-barred grudge match as the crowd cheered them on. It began with the Male Bulldog charging across the court at the Manual Ram, who reacted by trying to strike the bulldog with a two-legged drop kick. Scroll down for video . Ready for a fight: The Manuel Ram, in red, can be seen preparing before laying a two-legged drop kick in to the Male Bulldog as he came charging in . The kick may have landed, but it wouldn't knock the bulldog down, and the mascots began trading punches and trying to wrestle each other to the ground. The oversized animals eventually knocked each other down and were rolling around on the court before the scuffle is broken up. Although a bulldog and a ram do not normally encounter each other in nature, the rivalry between Male and Manual has gone back more than a hundred years, as both schools were established before 1900. The game eventually resumed, and Male came away with the victory over Manual 63-45. Fight night: The mascots were caught on video trading punches and shoves as the crowd goes wild . A video clip of the fight made its way to YouTube by Friday night, which has just under 5,000 views - and counting. In the video comments, there was a snippet of the rivalry, and both sides of the coin accused each other of a lack of class. WDRB reported that even though the fight was broken up at center court, tensions between the two schools boiled over in a brawl outside after the game, resulting in several suspensions.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:52 EST, 11 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:33 EST, 11 December 2012 . Money rolling in: Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor earned $1.2million from a new book contract . Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor revealed the fact that her ex-husband brought a bag of Quaaludes to his new wife on their wedding night. She also told other unusually personal stories about her upbringing in the Bronx, like how she unknowingly brought her cousin to a drug den where he shot up heroin. Sotomayor went on to describe how her personal health battle with diabetes caused her to fear dying at a young age and, in turn, stopped her from having children. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor told of these intimate stories about her upbringing in her memoir, titled 'My Beloved World', which is due to be released in January. The Associated Press received an early copy of the book and previewed some of the most interesting anecdotes about the justice's upbringing. Given her position as one of the three-serving female judges on the country's highest bench, Sotomayor wrote only about her life leading up to her judicial career, purposefully avoiding any potential conflicts of interest. Much of the book is spent discussing Sotomayor's underprivileged upbringing in the South Bronx, where her family was so poor that they never had a bank account. The 'world' that the book's title refers to is one in which her Puerto Rican parents and her siblings only spoke Spanish and not English in their tenement apartment. Growing up: Sotomayor was raised by her Puerto Rican parents in a tenement in the South Bronx, and the family was so poor that they did not have a bank account . One potentially political stance that Sotomayor takes in the book is one of support for affirmative action as she credits it to the reason why she was admitted to Princeton University and Yale Law School. She say that it is needed to get disadvantaged students to the starting line of a race to success. She acknowledges she entered through a . special door reserved for minority students but writes that her . accomplishments at Princeton- including receiving the highest prize . given to seniors, earning a place in the Phi Beta Kappa honor society . and graduating with highest honors- speak for themselves. Valuing education: One of the few political statements Sotomayor (seen here at her eighth grade graduation) makes in the book is a defense of affirmative action since she said she benefited from the policy . The up-from-poverty story is in many respects similar to the one told by her Supreme Court seatmate, Justice Clarence Thomas, in 'My Grandfather's Son.' Both grew up with few creature comforts and ran into prejudice on a regular basis. But where Thomas has become a strong opponent of affirmative action and says he felt stigmatized by the racial preference that also helped him get into Yale, Sotomayor says she took the opportunity to join the elite and ran with it. She acknowledges that her Hispanic heritage played a role in her rise to the Supreme Court, where she is the first Latina and third woman to be a justice. She says she has never let slurs about her roots or put-downs based on her gender get the best of her. One thing that has plagued her throughout her life, however, has been her struggles with diabetes. Sotomayor has spoken publicly and movingly about her diabetes before. She told children with diabetes that she suspected something was wrong when she started wetting her bed. In her book, Sotomayor relates several instances where she blacked out and was found unconscious, including by a roommate at Princeton, a client in Venice, Italy, and a friend's barking dog. She said such episodes were never frequent and have been rare in the last decade. Making a statement: She wrote a thankful message to her friends and professors in the Princeton yearbook . The disease may have been a big part of her decision not to have children, but Sotomayor says that partly as a result, she is godmother to more children than anyone she knows. Her beloved cousin Nelson comes up in the book, who eventually died of AIDS that she said he contracted through a contaminated needle. Sotomayor says she was working as a prosecutor when she gave Nelson a lift to what he told her only after the fact was a drug den in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx and waited for him in her car while he shot up heroin inside. The book also gives a look into her romantic life, detailing her marriage to her high school sweetheart, Kevin Noonan, soon after they graduated from college. They divorced during Sotomayor's time as a prosecutor in Manhattan, but parted amicably. Missing children: Sotomayor, seen here with her niece in an undated photo, said that her fear of dying young due to diabetes kept her from having or adopting children . One detail Sotomayor notes is that on their wedding night, Noonan produced a bag of Quaaludes- the hynotic-sedative that was popular in the 1970s- that was a gift from his friends. She insisted he flush the pills down the toilet. She says she used to smoke three-and-a-half packs of cigarettes a day, until she saw her young niece holding a pencil between her fingers and blowing imaginary rings of smoke. She spent five days in a residential program to quit smoking and says she hasn't had a cigarette since. But she could imagine lighting up one more time on her deathbed, as her grandmother did. Making the contrast between Sotomayor's past and present lives, she is taking home $1.2million from the book, which is due to be published simultaneously in English and Spanish in the new year.","Supreme Court justice tells of her tough childhood in a new memoir .

Tracey Korkmaz, 41, had hoped the operation at University College Hospital London would help her go from 23 stone to 18 stone. But during the procedure, known as a keyhole sleeve gastrectomy, doctors failed to notice her stomach was punctured and she died 10 days later. Tracey Korkmaz (pictured here eight years before her death) ied after her stomach lining was punctured during weight loss surgery . During the original keyhole procedure, surgeons discovered that Mrs Korkmaz ’s liver was enlarged. Lawyers . later established that the surgery should have been abandoned or . switched to a different type of operation, but instead it continued. Mrs Korkmaz then suffered internal bleeding and the operation had to be converted to open surgery. After she deteriorated following the surgery, doctors operated on her again to try and discover the cause of her feverish symptoms but could not find the leak, allowing poisonous fluids to continue to seep into her body and cause irreparable damage. A sleeve gastrectomy reduces the size . of the stomach by about 75 per cent. The stomach is divided vertically from top . to bottom, making it banana-shaped. Medical literature suggests the death rate from this procedure stands at 0.05 per cent. The risk of damage to internal organs is said to be 1 in 1000. Even after a third operation and repair of the leak she continued to deteriorate and died 10 days after the original surgery. The NHS reception worker left behind three children, her husband Yusuf, and a large family in Turkey. Her heartbroken mother, June Sillitoe, 69, said her daughter had thought long and hard about whether to go ahead with the surgery. ‘But she wanted to be healthier for the kids and wanted to know that she would be around to see them reach adulthood and one day become a grandmother herself,’ she explained. ‘The gastric bypass was a last resort but sadly, because of the mistakes made, she was robbed of this.’ Mrs Sillitoe, who now cares for Mrs Korkmaz’s three children, Riah 16, Enes, 13, and Zeren, seven, added: ‘Tracey’s death has left a huge gap in all of our lives and we’ve struggled to come to terms with the fact she has gone.’ Last month the family won a High Court battle when University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust agreed to pay a substantial undisclosed settlement to Mrs Korkmaz’s children. Mrs Sillitoe said: ‘Tracey and the children lived with me in south west London before her death in 2008 and we were a great team, with the children being our focus and priority. ‘I have tried to keep that going now she has gone. Things will never be the same again and nothing will turn back the clock but Tracey’s death cannot be in vain. ‘The settlement for the children means they can now pursue their dreams, such as going to university and enjoying the hobbies they love. ‘These are things that Tracey worked so hard to try and provide for them. It won’t bring her back, but knowing they have financial security to begin to move on with their lives provides some comfort.’ Happier times: Mrs Korkmaz with her mother June in 2007. Last month University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (pictured) agreed to pay a substantial undisclosed settlement to Mrs Korkmaz's children . The High Court judge praised Mrs Sillitoe for her devotion to caring for her grandchildren at the settlement approval hearing in London. Now, after winning her battle for justice, calling for University  College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to prove lessons have been learnt to prevent anymore ‘needless’ deaths. Mrs Sillitoe said: ‘We had so many questions about why Tracey died and while the inquest and admission of liability answered some of these, I want proof that the hospital trust has done something to make sure the mistakes made can never happen again.’ This follows a coroner’s request that the National Patient Safety Register investigate the trust after three deaths at University College Hospital between January and June 2008 following different routine operations. A verdict of death by accidental adverse healthcare event was given at the inquest into Tracey’s death in September 2008 at St Pancras Coroners Court. Holly Young, a medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell’s London office, representing the family said: ‘This is a tragic case that has seen three children lose their mum at an age when they were still very reliant on her. ‘The inquests into Tracey’s and two other needless deaths after operations at the University College Hospital were held on the same day and the coroner urged the National Patient Safety Register and other health authorities to investigate how mistakes were allowed to happen. 'June, Tracey’s children and other patients now need proof that these mistakes have been identified and learnt from to prevent any further tragedies. ‘It’s bad enough that Tracey’s stomach was punctured but for it then to not be properly identified and repaired causing irreparable damage is simply not acceptable. We have repeatedly called for patient safety to be the top priority across the NHS and mistakes like these should not be happening.’","Tracey Korkmaz, 41, had hoped the operation at University College Hospital London would help her go from 23 stone to 18 stone .

Middle class people will dominate the world in 20 years, a major US government report said yesterday. It said the number of people who can count themselves as middle income will treble to three billion and the number of people living in poverty will halve. But the report warned that the increased consumption of millions of newly enriched middle class people may strain resources, including food and water, unless innovation and peace allow rising demand to be met. Overpowering: By 2030, China and India will replace the US and EU in terms of power, a study claims . Growing: The harbour city of Shanghai has a population of over 18 million people; the report says that people will be competing for resources in 2030 . Inevitability: The study predicts that China and India will hold the most power in coming years, while the US and EU have been on a steady decline . Other perspective: Any way the power index falls, developing states will overtake developed states . Consumption: By 2030, India and China's middle class will rise to become major consumers, taking more resources . The report, . published by the National Intelligence Council, suggested that the . economies of China, India and Brazil will generate the new middle class, . who will produce better education standards, better health, and the . advance of women into greater wealth and power. It added: . ‘Individual empowerment will accelerate substantially owing to poverty . reduction and a huge growth of the global middle class. ‘For the first . time, a majority of the world’s population will not be impoverished, and . the middle classes will be the most important social and economic . sector in the vast majority of countries around the world. Demand for . consumer goods, including cars, (will) rise sharply with the growth of . the middle class.’ The new middle class will be mostly . urban, with nearly two-thirds of the world's population will live in . cities by 2030, with the majority of people connected by technology, . protected by advanced health care and linked by countries that work . together, perhaps with the United States and China cooperating to lead . the way. That's the best case scenario in a . report, Global Trends 2030, released Monday by the U.S. government's . National Intelligence Council. In . the worst case scenarios, rising population leads to conflict over . water and food, especially in the Mideast and Africa, and the . instability contributes to global economic collapse. The study is the intelligence community's analysis of where current trends will take the world in the next 15 to 20 years, intended to help policymakers plan for the best and worst possible futures to come. The report is broken down into what the National Intelligence Council calls megatrends that are likely to occur and game-changers — the what-if's that are less certain but would be so significant that they can't be ignored. Among the major trends: the rise of a global middle class that is better educated, connected via technology and healthier due to advances in medicine. Power will no longer reside with one or two key nations, but be spread across networks and coalitions of countries working together. In countries where there are declining birth rates and an aging population like the U.S., economic growth may slow. Sixty percent of the world's population will live in cities. Globalization: A new global trends report says that two-thirds of the world's population will be living in cities by 2030; here, China's most bustling seaside city, Shanghai, is seen . Planning ahead: The study is intended to help policymakers plan for the best and worst possible futures to come; New York City, pictured . Yet even with these advances, food, water and energy will be more scarce. 'Nearly . half of the world's population will live in areas experiencing severe . water stress,' the report said. Africa and the Middle East will be most . at risk of food and water shortages, but China and India also . vulnerable. Among the . anticipated crises is the worry of global economic collapse, fighting . among nations that don't adapt rapidly enough to change and the possible . spillover of instability in the Mideast and South Asia to the rest of . the world. Technology is seen as a potential savior to head off some of this conflict, boosting economic productivity to keep pockets filled despite rising population, rapid growth of cities and climate change.The report outlines several 'Potential Worlds' for 2030. Under the heading 'Stalled Engines', otherwise known as the 'most plausible worst-case scenario, the risks of interstate conflict increase,' the report said. 'The U.S. draws inward and globalization stalls.' In the most plausible best-case outcome, called 'Fusion,' the report said, 'China and the U.S. collaborate on a range of issues, leading to broader global cooperation.' And under another heading, the report describes a world where 'inequalities explode as some countries become big winners and others fail. ... Without completely disengaging, the U.S. is no longer the 'global policeman.'' Trending: India is part of a global trend that is advancing towards an increasing urbanization, according to which more than half of the world's population is living in towns and cities . Consumers: An Indian customer looks at a product on sale at a retail shop in Mumbai, India; the middle class in the country will grow exponentially by 2030 and will consume much of the world's goods . The report warns of the mostly catastrophic effect of possible 'Black Swans,' extraordinary events that can change the course of history. These include a severe pandemic that could kill millions in a matter of months and more rapid climate change that could make it hard to feed the world's population. Two positive events are also listed, including 'a democratic China or a reformed Iran,' which could bring more global stability. One bright spot for the U.S. is energy independence. 'With shale gas, the U.S. will have sufficient natural gas to meet domestic needs and generate potential global exports for decades to come,' the report said.","Global Trends 2030 predicts that two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities by 2030 .

High street banks gave their customers a helpline number that went through to a card insurance firm which has been fined for £10.5m for mis-selling card protection, according to a Dispatches investigation. As a consequence millions of customers were duped into buying worthless insurance meant to protect against fraudulent transactions on their credit or debit cards. In the Dispatches investigation, which is to be aired tonight, the programme claims that in 2006  banks such as Barclays and Natwest made lucrative commercial arrangements with a card insurance firm called CPP. Claims: In the Dispatches investigation, which is to be aired tonight, the programme claims that in 2006 big high street banks made lucrative commercial arrangements with card insurance firm called CPP . The Channel 4 programme alleges that a number of banks introduced customers to CPP via a sticker on new credit or debit cards, prompting them to call the company’s number to activate them or confirm receipt of them. But instead of going through to a helpline operated by the banks, the phone numbers were actually for a call centre run by CPP, reports The Telegraph. Duped: Instead of going through to a line operated by the banks, the phone numbers were actually for a call centre run by card insurance firm called CPP . The salesman at the end of the line would then try to foist the insurance policies on callers - they were sold 'unnecessary' card protection insurance, which cost around £35 a year, or identity protection insurance, which cost around £84 a year. The banks pocketed commission payments every time CPP sold or renewed a policy to one of their customers. A former CPP manager told Dispatches that the banks even signed off the scripts used by CPP call operatives. For every policy they sold they made £5. In November, CPP,  was fined a record £10.5million by the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog. It faces a total bill of £33.4million, including estimated compensation of £14.5million and costs associated with the investigation, for tactics first revealed by the Mail in February 2011. A total of 4.4million policies were sold between January 2005 and March 2011, and 18.7million were renewed over this period. CPP will not contact affected customers until an agreement has been reached with the FSA about how banks will pay for their part in the scandal. MPs described it as another ‘shocker’ for the financial industry in the wake of the Payment Protection Insurance scandal. The watchdog said both policies were often worthless as banks are already obliged to refund fraudulent transactions in the vast majority of cases. It said pushy CPP salesmen also ‘overstated’ the risks of criminals stealing personal details and making fraudulent transactions.","Claims made in a Dispatches programme due to be aired tonight .

Rescue: Checque was among members of SEAL Team Six that freed Dr Dilip Joseph, pictured, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, from Taliban militants who had abducted him last week . A Defense Department statement said Checque, 28, died of combat-related injuries but gave no further details of the mission. Checque's friends and former teachers remember him as a driven person and weren't surprised he would be willing to sacrifice himself. 'I can jut remember him at the end of practice never slowing down,' said Michael Choby, a former wrestling teammate.  'He had a military style haircut all though high school . He was interested in, as far as I can remember, going into the military after graduation.' Former teammate Todd Schuchert could only say: 'I am exteremely privileged just to have known him.' A former instructor said Checque was always willing to go all the way for what he believed was right. 'It was not surprising that he would give his life for something he believed in that strongly,' Doug Knipple, a former teacher, told WTAE. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Checque was a 2002 graduate of Norwin High School, where he was on the wrestling team. He was awarded a bronze star as well as several other military accolades in his 10-year military career. Checque was reportedly shot in the head as he and other members of Team Six exchanged gunfire with the militants holding Joseph captive. It is the same team that killed Osama bin Laden last year, but it's unclear whether Checque was on the bin Laden mission. The military says the adviser for Colorado Springs-based Morning Star Development was abducted last week and rescued after intelligence showed he was in imminent danger of injury or possible death.

Gone too soon: Checque, pictured in a high school yearbook photo, died of combat-related injuries suffered during the operation to rescue Dr Joseph . 'He gave his life for his fellow Americans, and he and his teammates remind us once more of the selfless service that allows our nation to stay strong, safe and free.'

Roki Aprisdianto was serving six years in jail on the Indonesian island of Java when he made his get-away after a group of burka-clad women came to visit their husbands. Under the flowing robes, he walked out of the prison with the women, undetected by officers, and laid low for a few weeks in the east Java town of Madiun. According to police, when the heat . died down he put the burka back on and made his way to the local bus . station where he purchased a ticket to travel to the town of Solo. Once . seated on the bus, and certain that his escape plot had been a total . success, he removed the headgear part of the gown, revealing his male . features. Unfortunately . for Aprisdianto, a large number of Indonesia’s anti-terror squad were . travelling on the bus – and the escaper was immediately arrested. ‘He made what you might call a big . mistake,’ said national police spokesman Major General Suhardi Alius. ‘He took his veil off because he thought he was safe and it was his bad . luck that police were travelling on the same bus.’ It is not known what happened to the . woman who passed the burka to Aprisdianto, but police believe she was . probably wearing a second burka, which she slipped off before leaving . the jail with the other women who were similarly dressed. Caught out: The convicted terrorist was immediately arrested on a bus when he took the veil off - because many of the other passengers happened to be anti-terrorist police (file photo) Aprisdianto was sentenced to six years behind bars in 2011 for masterminding a series of bombings. Two other militants believed to be part of his group were captured in Solo town a short time after his re-arrest. A third, believed to be the group’s fundraiser, was arrested a day later. The three told police they had helped Aprisdianto prepare a bomb that was planted at a police station after he had escaped from prison - the device failed to explode. Aprisdianto is now facing many more years in prison – wearing custom-made shorts and a T-shirt.","Roki Aprisdianto was serving six years in jail for a series of bombings .

He is the first to be charged with . maltreatment of his trainees. He could get up to 12 years in prison if . convicted of all charges. A woman identified only as airman three broke down in tears yesterday as she recalled what Deraas would say to her. 'He would say he was working in (charge of quarters), he would text me and say he was bored and say, ""I'm horny"".' Another . woman said Deraas called her attractive and that they agreed to meet at . a dance hall while she was in technical training at Lackland, according . to My San Antonio. They . went to his home that night and began a relationship that lasted until . she left for her first duty station, spending weekends in his apartment . having sex and watching television. Deraas . is the ninth boot camp instructor at Lackland to be charged in a sex . scandal. So far 25 trainers have come under investigation for incidents . going back to 2008. The Air Force has identified 49 women as victims. Due to the revelations, the U.S. Air Force chose a woman to lead its basic training unit at the base.

She takes over for Col Glenn Palmer, who was ousted earlier this year as attention to the scandal intensified. Another commander at Lackland was also relieved over the summer for what military prosecutors described as a lack of confidence. The most serious allegations at Lackland involved  Air Force Staff Sgt Luis Walker, sentenced to 20 years in prison in July after being convicted of raping one female recruit and sexually assaulting several others. Walker, a married father with two . boys, was found guilty on all 28 charges faced with prosecutors claiming . that he had sexual intercourse with four of ten female recruits. He faced life in prison. Earlier this week, Staff Sgt Kwinton Estacio was sentenced to a year in prison and received a dishonorable discharge after pleading guilty to having sex with a trainee. He faced up to 14 years in prison. In early August, Tech Sgt Christopher . Smith, 33, was convicted on two of four counts of misconduct with basic . trainees and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Among . his charges Smith was found by jurors having sought an intimate . relationship with a teenager trainee but not guilty of making sexual . advances to her. He was also found guilty of a social relationship with a second trainee while innocent of a charge of obstruction of justice. His rank has been reduced to Airman First Class, escaping the highest possible charge of a year in prison and full removal from the Air Force with a bad conduct discharge. Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group that has pressed Congress to hold hearing on the Lackland scandal, continued calling for legislative changes to military policies with news of Liddick's appointment. 'Hopefully, Col. Deborah Liddick will do a great job,' said Nancy Parrish, the group's president. She added that what's occurring at Lackland is part of 'a much broader problem endemic throughout all the services.' U.S. Rep. Howard 'Buck' McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, visited Lackland last week and said he believed the Air Force was being diligent in its investigation.

In the money: Physicist Stephen Hawking has been handed a £1.8million prize in recognition of his lifetime's contribution to theoretical physics . Stephen Hawking says he might splash out on a holiday home after he was handed £1.8million in recognition of his lifetime contribution to theoretical physics. The former Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge University is one of the latest winners of the most lucrative science prize ever established. The Fundamental Physics Prize awarded the huge sum to Professor Hawking, 70, for his discovery that black holes emit radiation, and his 'deep contributions' to quantum gravity and quantum aspects of the early universe. An identical prize was shared between the seven scientists who led the effort to discover a Higgs-like particle at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Set up in July by Russian internet billionaire Yuri Milner, the Fundamental Physics Prize aims to recognise scientific breakthroughs that have advanced our knowledge of the Universe at the deepest level. The winners were chosen by an independent committee of physicists, including Nima Arkani-Hamed, the Iranian-American physicists renowned for his work on dimensional deconstruction, and Ed Witten, the string theorist. Further prizes were awarded to other physicists in two categories in recognition for their achievements in the advancement of our understanding of fundamental physics. Professor Hawking told the Guardian he was 'delighted and honoured' to receive the $3million prize. 'No one undertakes research in physics with the intention of winning a prize,' he wrote in an email. 'It is the joy of discovering something no one knew before. 'Nevertheless prizes like these play an important role in giving public recognition for achievement in physics. They increase the stature of physics and interest in it.' He added that he had not settled on how to spend his new-found wealth, but said at least some of the cash would go to helping his daughter with her autistic son and that he might put the rest towards a holiday home. A second $3million prize was shared between the scientists who led the team at the Large Hadron Collider who discovered what could be the long-predicted Higgs Boson particle. One of the recipients, Lyn Evans, head of the LHC, told the Guardian he was 'gobsmacked' to learn he had won the cash and would immediately go out and buy himself a new iPad. Another of the winners, Fabiola Gianotti, head of the Atlas group at CERN, said she plans to use her $500,000 share to set up a fund to help out young physicists that she works with. CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said: 'It is a great honour for the LHC’s achievement to be recognised in this way. 'This prize recognizes the work of everyone who has contributed to the project over many years. 'The Fundamental Physics Prize underlines the value of fundamental physics to society, and I am delighted that the Foundation has chosen to hold its first award ceremony at CERN.' Breakthrough: A second prize of the same value was awarded to the scientists who led the discovery of what could be the Higgs Boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN earlier this year . Mr Milner, whose Milner Foundation will pay out the prize money, holds an advanced degree in theoretical physics from Moscow State University, but abandoned his PhD to study for an MBA and went on to make a fortune investing in social media. He said he hopes the prizes will help to bring recognition to the achievements of physicists and help support them to future breakthroughs. Along with the two special prizes for Professor Hawking and the Cern team, the prize committee named a handful of other scientists who will be shortlisted for the $3million Fundamental Physics Prize to be announced next March. Their work ranged from breakthroughs in quantum field theory, the development of exotic materials known as topological insulators, and discoveries in string theory. Three further physicists under 35 were awarded $100,000 prizes for breakthroughs in other areas of physics. Commenting on the selections, Nima Arkani-Hamed, a member of the committee, said: 'Choosing this year's recipients from such a large pool of spectacular nominations was a very difficult task . 'The selected physicists have done transformative work spanning a wide range of areas in fundamental physics. I especially look forward to future breakthroughs from the first recipients of the New Horizons in Physics Prize.' Mr Milner added: 'I am very much pleased with the decisions of the Selection Committee. 'I hope that the prizes will bring further recognition to some of the most brilliant minds in the world and the great accomplishments they have produced.'","Cambridge scientist is the latest winner of the Fundamental Physics Prize .

A Florida grandmother is campaigning for clearer custody rights after the prime suspect in her daughter's disappearance currently has complete control of her grandchildren. The missing woman, Michelle Parker, appeared on The People's Court in November 2011 in a dispute with her ex-fiance Dale Smith. On the same day the show was aired Parker disappeared without trace. Police have since made Smith the main suspect in this case but he maintains control of the children. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, is now challenging this. Volatile: Michelle Parker and Dale Smith had a stormy relationship . Challenge: Yvonne Stewart is pushing to change custody rights in Florida. The prime suspect is the disappearance of her daughter is currently in control of her grandchildren . 'Grandparents need to be heard by a judge. We need the right to go to a . court and ask a judge to hear our case, so he can decide if I'll be . able to visit my grandchildren,' Stewart told Fox Orlando. 'I don't have the right . to petition. That's what we want. We just want the right to be heard.' Stewart has revealed that Parker and her two young children lived with her before Michelle disappeared. The grandparents have written agreement . with Smith for the custody of the children but Stewart wants clearer . rights established and legal right to petition the court for visitation. Dispute: Michelle Parker appeared on The People's Court to dispute an engagement ring with ex-fiance Dale Smith. The program aired the same day she disappeared . While the grandparents' rights are enshrined in some states, they have very little legal power in the state of Florida. Stewart launched a campaign and petition that grants visitation rights to grandparents when a child's parent goes missing or is murdered. Florida House representative Darryl Rouson has filed a bill in Tallahasse that will now go through the legislative process. Smith, who appeared with Parker on The People's Court show, remains the primary suspect in her unsolved disappearance. Orlando Police Chief Paul Rooney made the announcement in a news conference in which Stewart made an emotional plea to Smith. Mrs Stewart said: 'You could have avoided this Dale, if you had cooperated with the police and took a polygraph test when they asked you, you could have avoided a lot of stress. 'So unfortunately, you brought this on yourself. We're not going to stop until we find out who did this.' Mr Rooney said Smith 'simply refused' to take a polygraph test when it was offered to him, ABC News reported. 'Rocky': The couple's relationship was described as 'tense' by friends . Mrs Stewart added: 'Dale, honestly, if you're out there, honey, and you're listening to me, I have always said from day one - it's okay if couples fight. 'If you made a mistake, it was just a second of, ""Oh, I lost my head,"" or whatever and you didn't know what to do ... our family needs to have Michelle home. We need to heal.' Miss Parker's sister also sent a message to Smith, saying: 'Help us. Help those kids. It's the mother of those kids. You loved her at one point.' Miss Parker disappeared on November 17, the same day the couple's appearance on The People's Court was aired. The 33-year-old had twins and a very stormy relationship with Smith. She was last seen dropping off the twins at Smith's house. Police conducted an night-time raid on Smith's father's home during investigations but would not comment on the findings of the search or and what sparked the raid. Miss Parker's friend Angela Launer told ABCNews.com: . 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself.' Miss Launer, 34, said the relationship was 'rocky' and 'tense.' Dale Smith (left) remains the prime suspect in the unsolved disappearance of Michelle Parker (right) She said: 'He hurt my best friend. I didn't like him because he made her cry. No one should ever be treated that way.' Miss Parker applied for a restraining order from Smith in 2009, but was denied one for lack of evidence. It has also been revealed that Smith was dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 after several court martials, including military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery. On the TV show Miss Parker and Smith argued over whether Parker had to pay for a $5,000 engagement ring she tossed away during one of their arguments. The judge ruled the two should split the cost. Miss Parker's family began to realize something was wrong when her 11-year-old son let the family know that he was home from school and his mother was not there. Miss Launer said: 'She would never have taken off, done that to her brother, sister or mother ... that's why we're crying every day.'","Michelle Parker, 33-year-old mother of 3, argued with ex-fiance Dale Smith, 40, on The People's Court then vanished same day show was aired .

"By . Neil Simpson . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:06 EST, 8 December 2012 . The problems started a couple of months after Judith Hitchins gave birth to her second son. ‘The first thing I noticed was some discomfort, but when I pressed on my tummy I could feel a lump – it was about the size of a ping-pong ball,’ recalls the 39-year-old from Warrington, Cheshire. ‘Obviously, I was worried – when you find a lump you instantly think cancer.’ Her GP referred her to an NHS gynaecologist, who said it was likely to be nothing but that it should be removed and tested to make sure. ‘They said this operation would allow them to make a proper diagnosis,’ says Judith. There would be a three-month wait to have surgery on the NHS – but in 2010, Judith had taken out private health insurance with PruHealth. ‘I was pleased I’d finally get to use it, and hoped I could be seen in a matter of weeks. That’s why you take out these policies,’ she says. Anger: Judith Hitchins, pictured with her sons Will and James, fought against her private health insurance company for six months over compensation . Judith contacted PruHealth, and during a conversation with a telephone operator mentioned that she had suffered from endometriosis in the past – a common condition that causes growths around the uterus. This admission triggered a chain of events that led to her claim being held up for six months, and ultimately being turned down. She managed to have the decision reversed – but only on the night before her operation. Judith says the whole experience was ‘incredibly stressful’ and made her question why she’d bothered to pay into a policy in the first place. And hers is not an isolated case. A perfect storm is brewing in Britain’s £5 billion-a-year private medical insurance industry. Premiums are rising, policyholder numbers are falling – and complaints about high charges and poor service have triggered an official investigation by watchdogs the Competition Commission. Health how-to: Make sure you are not caught unawares by the small print of your health insurance policy . In theory, private medical insurance . allows you to avoid NHS waiting lists and get treated where, when and by . whom you choose, ideally in your own room at a private hospital or on a . private NHS ward. But cover is being reduced on every type of policy. Those with comprehensive plans are being hit as firms slash the amount . they pay surgeons for carrying out popular procedures. A year ago Bupa paid private doctors up to £761 per eye for cataract surgery. Today it’s £289. It means many top surgeons are no longer available to Bupa customers. If policyholders want to see them, they have to pay the difference. The Financial Services Ombudsman has seen . a surge in complaints from policyholders over shrinking lists of . approved surgeons and hospitals, rising premiums and the availability of . new or ‘experimental’ cancer drugs. There are many arguments over the . small print that governs what will and won’t be covered. In Judith’s . case, it was her honesty about having suffered a possibly related . pre-existing condition that caused her problems. She . says: ‘In the months after my first conversation with a telephone . operator, I called at least eight times, always having to start from the . beginning with someone new. ‘They said they covered only diagnostic procedures, which this was. But because I’d mentioned my pre-existing condition, they said the op was a treatment for that, which wouldn’t be covered. In fact, the doctors just didn’t know what the lump was, and all this time I was worried and in pain. They told me “We have to be careful of fraudulent claims”, which made me even more angry.’ In the end Judith, 39, who lives with her husband Chris and two boys, James, four, and nine-month-old Will, turned to their insurance broker, which called PruHealth on her behalf and got approval for the procedure. Then, in September, two days before her operation, the insurer called again to say her claim had been declined. ‘I’d mentioned the position of the lump – close to my caesarean scar – to their rep. The guy explained that it had been decided the problem was related to the birth, and therefore not covered. I just exploded. They’d only got all this information because I was honest when answering questions.’ Judith went back to her broker, who successfully intervened a second time, and the operation went ahead. ‘I got the green light the night before the op. The lump was benign, but the whole process was utterly stressful.’ Brian Walters, of medical insurance broker Regency Health in Cheltenham, helped Judith get her claim paid. He says her case shows how important it is to have someone on your side in the event of a dispute. ‘Brokers can be your advocate and should have the contacts and the inside knowledge to pursue your claim effectively,’ he explains. David Priestley, at PruHealth says: . ‘We try to make every claim as smooth as possible but sometimes we need . extra information from policyholders and professionals so claims can’t . always be agreed in a single phone conversation. However, in this . instance our claims process was not up to its usual high standards for . which we are very sorry.’ If . you don’t have access to an independent broker, the best advice is to . be cautious when you contact your insurer and to simply read out the . details on your referral rather than talking to – and risking getting . tripped up by – the phone operator. The . world of health insurance has become a minefield. To help, we have . quizzed insurance insiders, doctors and patients to take the temperature . of an industry on the edge of a crisis. Plenty . of Britons say private medical insurance has saved their lives. Access . to the right specialists at the right time can make any premiums worth . paying. But critics say . policies promise more than they deliver, with confusing small print. So . how do you choose and make the best of a private provider? No cover: Cystic fibrosis sufferer Cavan Arrowsmith . Cavan Arrowsmith knows that claiming on private medical insurance won’t be easy – because it’s been hard enough getting quotes in the first place. Cavan, 26, is an IT technologist for a mortgage company in Birmingham. He’s fit and healthy – but because he has cystic fibrosis, policies are only ever offered on special terms. He says: ‘The big providers such as Aviva, Axa and Bupa won’t cover anything related to that pre-existing condition. 'I’m happy using the NHS to keep my CF in check but I’m concerned that any illness or disease in later life won’t be covered because of it.’ Most insurers say pre-existing conditions can start to be covered after at least two problem-free years. As something like CF may require changing treatment, it may never lose its ‘pre-existing’ tag. Cavan is now discussing policies with an independent broker – and experts say he is right to get help. ‘Nowadays it is all but impossible for consumers to make a reliable comparison when they buy private medical insurance. It is complicated at the best of times and individual medical circumstances add a further layer of complexity,’ says broker Brian Walters. Paying out: Gretchen Pierce . Gretchen Pierce, 45, made a successful claim for foot surgery via Axa in 2011, and chose a surgeon who had performed a metatarsal operation for Wayne Rooney. Gretchen’s operation was a success and she was soon back at work promoting London’s museums to tourists. But her policy stopped paying out when she reached the £1,000 limit for physiotherapy, even though she needed four extra sessions at £90 a time. Private prescriptions weren’t covered either so Gretchen, left, spent almost £100 on painkillers. Sarah Pennells of SavvyWoman financial advisers, says: ‘Insurers put a lot of emphasis on the things they cover and skate over the things they don’t. 'As a consumer you need to think about the full picture when you decide on a policy.’","Judith Hitchins, 39, had private health insurance but found it difficult to claim compensation .

A decade after twin bombs killed 202 people, including seven U.S. tourists on the island of Bali, survivors and victims' families on Friday braved a fresh terrorism threat to remember those lost to the tragedy. Security was tight with more than 2,000 police and military, including snipers, deployed to guard the memorial services on the island resort after reports involving the 'certain movement' of terrorists were announced two days earlier, raising the security alert to its highest level. 'The loss is not just giving us grief, it is also giving us the strength to fight terrorism and all other extremist activities,' said Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika, the former police chief who led the investigations following the attacks.

The attack was carried out by suicide bombers from the al-Qaida-linked group Jemaah Islamiyah and kick started a wave of violence that would hit an embassy, hotels and restaurants in the world's most-populous Muslim-majority nation. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended Friday's event along with John Howard, who was Australian premier at the time of the attacks. Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa along with other dignitaries also paid their respects. 'On September 11, terrorists attacked the great symbols of American prestige. Here in Bali, they attacked our people and, through them, sought to overwhelm our values,' Gillard said. 'Here on these bustling streets, they inflicted searing pain and grief that will never end. But even as the debris fell, it was obvious the attack on our sense of ourselves — as Australians, as human beings — had failed.'

"By . Adam Lee-potter . PUBLISHED: . 16:02 EST, 29 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:15 EST, 1 October 2012 . The father of J. K. Rowling has finally made up with his once-estranged daughter, despite claims she partly based a ‘vile’ character on him in her new novel, The Casual Vacancy. Peter Rowling fell out with the 47-year-old best-selling author nine years ago after he sold a collection of rare Harry Potter first editions to cover his £100,000 debts. He claimed his daughter – who is worth £560 million and whose first novel for adults was published last week – refused to help him after his burger van business went bust. Difficult relationship: J. K. Rowling with her father Peter in 2000 . The 67-year-old retired engineer said at the time: ‘It’s a heartbreaking situation. I fear I have lost my daughter. I can only hope Joanne will one day come to understand why I did it.’ But he has now revealed he has recently been reconciled with Miss Rowling and is ‘on good terms’ with her. At his £250,000 seaside flat in Swanage, Dorset, Mr Rowling said last week: ‘Joanne and I are fine. We talk now. Everything is good. There is no problem any more. ‘Families are funny things but I am incredibly proud of my daughter. She is a brilliant girl. I have read all her books – though the first was my favourite. And I look forward to reading her new one. ‘I have heard it contains a vile character supposedly based on me – a man who has a difficult relationship with a teenager – but I don’t know if that’s true. Either way, I’ll keep smiling. That’s the sort of person I am.’ It is believed that the character he is referring to is the father of Andrew,  a troubled adolescent central to The Casual Vacancy. Mr Rowling also revealed how the 2003 rift came about after he rang his daughter to tell her he would be auctioning rare, signed Harry Potter books to settle his business debts. One bore the personal note: ‘Happy Father’s Day 2000 and lots of love from your first-born, J. K. Rowling.’ JK Rowling's first adult novel, The Casual Vacancy, is thought to feature a 'vile' character based on her father . Four of the seven novels later fetched £50,000, while the rest failed to reach their reserve price. Insisting he had no option but to sell them, Mr Rowling said then: ‘It was a short conversation. I was nervous about talking to her because in her position I would be very angry. Her reaction was natural – she was livid.’ He also dismissed previous rumours that the rift developed after he began a relationship with another woman when Miss Rowling’s mother was struck down by multiple sclerosis. Mr Rowling married his current wife Jan, his former secretary when he worked at Rolls-Royce in Bristol, after his first wife Anne died in 1990. ‘The inference is a bloody insult – I’d challenge anyone to wire me up to a lie detector and ask me the truth,’ he said. ‘My relationship with Jan didn’t start until a year after Anne died.’ Miss Rowling, who has admitted that an episode in her new book is based  on her relationship with her father, said recently: ‘I did not have an easy relationship with my father.’ Two years ago she revealed: ‘It’s such a huge thing to be estranged from a parent, but there would have to be very big reasons for that. So that’s where I am. I have my reasons. ‘It wasn’t a good relationship for a very long time. But I had a need to please that I kept going for a long time and then there just came a point at which I had to pull up and say, “I can’t do this any more.” ’ A spokesman for Miss Rowling said the author did not wish to comment.","Peter Rowling fell out with his daughter nine years ago .

Rick Majerus, the jovial college basketball coach who led Utah to the 1998 NCAA final and had only one losing season in 25 years with four schools, died Saturday. He was 64. Utah industrialist Jon Huntsman, the coach's long-time friend, confirmed in a statement released through The Salt Lake Tribune that Majerus died of heart failure in a Los Angeles hospital. The coach had been hospitalized there for several months. Passionate coach: Rick Majerus reacts after a foul was not called during a St. Louis Billikens game against the Michigan State Spartans in the 2012 NCAA Men's basketball tournament . Respected leader: Majerus gives instructions to Kwamain Mitchell #3 of the Saint Louis Billikens . Players remembered Majerus as a coach who was exacting and perhaps a bit unorthodox at times, but always fair. ‘It was a unique experience, I'll tell you that, and I loved every minute of it,’ said Saint Louis guard Kyle Cassity, who was mostly a backup on last season's 26-win team after starting for Majerus earlier in his college career. ‘A lot of people questioned the way he did things, but I loved it. He'd be hard as hell on you, but he really cared.’ The school announced November 19 that Majerus wouldn't return to Saint Louis because of the heart condition. He ended the school's 12-year NCAA tournament drought last season, and bounced back from his only losing season, with a team that won its opening game and took top regional seed Michigan State to the wire. The Billikens were ranked for the first time since 1994-95. Prime time: Majerus as head coach of the Utah Utes looking on during the Maui Invitational game against the Indiana Hoosiers at Lahaina Civic Center in Maui, Hawaii in November 1998 . Majerus was undergoing evaluation and treatment in California for the ongoing heart trouble and the school announced he was on leave in late August. Loyola of Chicago coach Porter Moser, a former Majerus assistant at Saint Louis, tweeted, ‘RIP to my friend and mentor Coach Majerus. I learned so much about the game and life. We lost one of the best! My heart is heavy tonight.’ Majerus had a history of heart problems dating to 1989 that persisted despite a daily constitutional of a one-mile swim. He had a stent inserted in August 2011 in Salt Lake City and missed some games in the 2011-12 season after gashing his leg in a collision with players. Majerus was 95-69 in five seasons at Saint Louis and had a 25-year record of 517-216. He had his most success at Utah, going 323-95 from 1989-2004. He was at Marquette from 1983-86, and Ball State from 1987-89. ‘Rick left a lasting legacy at the University of Utah, not only for his incredible success and the national prominence he brought to our basketball program, but also for the tremendous impact he made on the young men who were fortunate enough to play on his teams,’ Utah athletic director Dr. Chris Hill said in a statement. In action: Majerus confers with Utah Utes players Drew Hansen, right, and Ben Caton, left, during the John R. Wooden Classic against the Arizona Wildcats on December 7, 1996 . ‘His standard of excellence extended beyond the basketball court and into the academic and personal success of his players. He will be deeply missed and we grieve for his family and all of his friends.’ Majerus took 12 teams to the NCAA tournament and four to the NIT, with the 1998 Utah team losing to Kentucky in the NCAA championship game. ‘It's a sad day for college basketball,’ UNLV coach Dave Rice said. ‘Certainly one of the great college basketball coaches. He took talent where they were most effective. When you went up against Coach Majerus and you won you knew you did something special.’ On the court: Guard Andre Miller of the Utah Utes shoots the ball as Arizona Wildcats forward Michael Dickerson attempts to block him during the John R.

A former law student stole her next door neighbour's identity to carry out a  £100,000 luxury car scam. Stephanie Lane used Susan Cooper's personal details, which she obtained from a  bank statement delivered to her in error, to apply for credit for high-value  vehicles. Newcastle Crown Court heard the 24-year-old applied for finance for a £50,000  BMW, a £40,000 Audi, a £10,000 BMW sports car and a £5,000 Volvo in her  neighbour's name. Scene: Stephanie Lane's case was heard at Newcastle Crown Court where she was handed suspended jail sentence . Despite the applications being granted by the four showrooms she visited, the  mum-of-two's plan to get her hands on the vehicles was foiled when the  companies asked for extra confirmation of her identity. Lane, of Marsden Way, Seaham, who has 10 GCSEs and three A levels, including  law, was arrested after details of the finance agreements were received by Miss  Cooper. Lane pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud during a two week period in  February. Mrs Cooper told police she was left under enormous stress and worry about what  impact the scam will have on her future credit rating. She said she was disappointed a neighbour would act in such a way. Her statement said: 'She never even attempted any explanation or apologised for  her actions. 'It is very difficult for me to see Stephanie Lane, knowing she was the person  responsible for causing me such stress and worry.' Busted: Lane's plans to purchase a top-of-the-range BMW were foiled when the company asked for more ID . Judge John Evans said Lane's education had been a success and told her: 'On the  face of it you appeared to be someone who was destined for a life which would  be fulfilled and would certainly be honest. 'It is difficult to comprehend what was going through your mind when you  embarked on this series of attempts to obtain valuable cars.' Lane was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, with 250  hours unpaid work and a three month night time curfew. Nick Cartmel, defending, said the scam was 'clumsy and inadequate' as Lane used  many of her own personal details, including her address, on some of the  applications. Mr Cartmel said Lane has two young children to care for and added: 'She is a  non violent, non sexual offender who I would ask the court to give a chance to. 'She is genuinely remorseful.'","Stephanie Lane used neighbour Susan Cooper's details to get hands on top-end motor vehicles .

It is the belt-straining finale to the Christmas meal, a massive pudding accompanied by oodles of brandy butter. But families would do better to either buy a smaller one or, preferably, bake their own, says TV cook Mary Berry. Offering some money-saving tips for the festive season, she said large Christmas puddings were an unnecessary expense. ‘The best thing is to try to make your own pudding, then you don’t have to spend money,’ she said. ‘But if you do buy one, then buy a really small one. Often people buy a big one and do you really eat it all? No, it goes in the bin.’ Mrs Berry said that all too often people fell into the trap of buying too much Christmas food. ‘It’s important to know how many you’re catering for and not buy too much,’ she told the Daily Mail. ‘So much food goes to waste. People think, “It’s Christmas, we must go wild, we must have nuts, we must have fancy nibbles”. Choose the things your family enjoy and leave out the rest.’ The Great British Bake Off star, famous for her kind but no-nonsense manner, said planning should start in the early weeks of December, to ensure a stress-free Christmas day. ‘The key is to get down to organising it right now, start this week,’ she said. ‘Get a big sheet of paper and make a list of how many people are coming, what you want to cook, then start shopping to find bargains early. Once all the lists are made, you drop your shoulders and it’s a doddle.’ Know how many: Mary said that all too often people fall into the trap of buying too much Christmas food. She said: 'Choose the things your family enjoy and leave out the rest' Mrs Berry, who was speaking at the Specsavers National Book Awards in London this week, where her book, Mary Berry’s Complete Cookbook, was nominated for an award, also suggested some recipes for the Christmas season. ‘I always like to make a shepherd’s pie, it’s easy to make, economical and goes a long way,’ she said. ‘I also tend to make a fish pie on Christmas Eve to give a contrast to the Christmas roast the following day’. The 77-year-old will have a traditional Christmas at home in Buckinghamshire with her husband Paul, 80, and their family.","Mary Berry said people often bought too much Christmas food .

Marks & Spencer will for the first time open some stores at midnight on the morning of Christmas Eve in a bid to lure last-minute shoppers. The chain will open more than 160 stores early across the country, joining many other supermarkets, some of which will be trading around the clock throughout much of December. M&S’s decision was prompted by Chancellor George Osborne’s refusal to allow large shops to extend Sunday opening hours on December 23, traditionally the year’s busiest food shopping day. Battle for business: Shoppers will be able to pick up last minute festive treats from midnight on the morning of Christmas Eve at some M&S stores . As a result shoppers will be able to tour the aisles, buying their turkey and all the trimmings, in the early hours of December 24 for the first time at the chain. Hundreds of supermarkets will be trading around the clock on most days in December and - like M&S - opening from midnight on Christmas Eve. At the same time, many other retailers will be extending their opening hours deep into the night in the days before. For example, Waitrose will open most of its stores until 10pm and some until 11pm from December 16 onwards. M&S will open more than 160 stores until 10pm or later on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday before Christmas. As many as 14 will remain open until midnight. This year December 23 - normally the busiest food shopping day of the year - falls on a Sunday. It means large stores are restricted to opening for no more than six hours, which could deal a heavy blow to their takings. Waitrose has also extended its opening hours in the run up to Christmas . Chancellor George Osborne has refused pleas from a number of retailers to suspend the Sunday trading restrictions this year. This coincides with the fact that stores are already struggling for sales against online rivals and amid a spending squeeze. The number of people visiting the shops is running much lower than a year ago, according to figures published by the British Retail Consortium yesterday. Out of town malls are seeing 5.7per cent fewer shoppers, while the figure is down by 5.5per cent in shopping centres and 2.1per cent in the high street. An M&S spokesman said: ‘December 23 is traditionally our busiest food shopping day of the year. ‘Last year, aisles were packed with more than 6.3 million customers scrambling to snap up items for Christmas dinner - over 184,000 of food orders, 279,000 turkeys and 1.6 million mince pies were sold on the day. ‘To give customers a bit of a breather as they tick off those last few ""To Dos"" in the lead-up to Christmas, we will open 49 full offer and 54 Simply Food stores across England, Wales and Northern Ireland from midnight on Christmas Eve.’ Director of retail at the chain, Sacha Berendji, said: ‘We know that the days leading up to Christmas are some of the most hectic for our customers. ‘Due to Sunday trading rules, we can only open for six hours on one of the busiest days of the year. ‘We hope that these early bird hours on Monday will ease the pressure and give busy shoppers a bit more time to pick up Christmas food orders or last minute presents.’ Early birds: Marks & Spencer said it wanted to ease the pressure on customers and give them more time to pick up last-minute items . The BRC said: ‘Today’s competitive retailing is all about offering customers what they want, when they want it. With changing working patterns and lifestyles we live in 24-7 culture. ‘Within the law, retailers strive to open at times when people are free to shop. In these tough times few retailers want to lose out to their competition by shutting the doors on willing customers.’","Some M&S branches will open at midnight on Christmas Eve in a bid to lure last-minute shoppers .

A judge took pity on a 74-year-old man who grew cannabis to pay for a drugs rehabilitation course for his addict son. Desperate Frank Jones grew seven plants worth £12,000 in a small bedroom at his home in South Yorkshire. The former oil-rig worker planned to sell the plants to raise cash to pay for his son to undergo rehabilitation. Frank Jones, left, grew cannabis at his home near Worsbrough Commmon, right, to send his son to rehab . Jones was facing from six months to three years in prison as a 'significant' producer of the class B drug under current sentencing guidelines. But Judge Paul Watson QC, sitting at Sheffield Crown Court, said he was suspending the jail term because Jones' son was having difficulties and he 'just wanted to put him on the straight and narrow.' Police officers were called to Jones' address after a strong smell of cannabis was reported coming from the property. Gardener and former allotment holder Jones took the officers upstairs to the bedroom and they found a sophisticated growing set-up with seven plants. The estimated yield of 398 grammes would have been worth £12,000 on the streets. Iain Hillis, prosecuting, said after his arrest Jones was 'brutally frank' with the police. Illegal crop: Jones said growing the drugs was 'as easy as growing tomatoes' but guaranteed the judge it would never happen again . Mr Hillis said: 'He denied taking cannabis and said he was growing it commercially so he could pay for his son, rather ironically, to receive private access to a rehab clinic.' It was a commercial enterprise and he was a ""significant"" grower towards the lower end of the sentencing guidelines. The former oil rig worker said he believed the plants were only worth between £2,000 and £3,000 and he got the idea to grow cannabis from a fellow gardener. He had not even worked out how he would sell the plants or find someone to buy them. Sheffield Crown Court: Judge Paul Watson QC said Jones just wanted to put his son 'on the straight and narrow' Jones, of Worsbrough Common, Barnsley admitted producing a class B controlled drug on August 7. Judge Watson told the court: 'It clearly crosses the custody threshold. Can I suspend it? The answer is ""yes"".' He said Jones was growing cannabis to sell but he fully accepted it was for the benefit of his drug-ravaged son. 'Growing cannabis albeit on a relatively small scale always attracts a prison sentence,' the judge told him.  'What I have had to decide is whether to suspend it in your case. I have decided the right thing is to do so.' He gave Jones a six-month jail term suspended for a year and told him: 'As long as you don't commit any further offences you won't hear any more of it.' The judge ordered the confiscation and destruction of the drug-growing equipment and plants.  Jones, who was wearing a suit and tie replied: 'It's all gone, Your Honour, thank you very much.' After the hearing all he would say was: 'They told me it was a funny idea but it was the right idea if you know my son. I am highly satisfied with the verdict and I can guarantee it will never happen again.' No details were given in court about his son or his drug problems. But Jones explained after an earlier court hearing: 'You tell me any parent who sees their son suffering who would not do just about anything to help them. 'I used to work in Amsterdam and was offered cannabis to smoke and said ""no"". Now I'm being branded as some sort of drug dealer. 'They said the plants I grew had a value of almost £12,000 just from a packet of seeds? All I wanted was to make £2,500 to get my son into rehab because he has a serious drugs problem. 'Are they telling me those plants are worth all that money? To be honest it was as easy growing them as tomatoes. I'm no drug dealer and when the police came to the house and took them away I didn't think I had anything to worry about. 'When the letter arrived saying I had to go to court and I learned what I was charged with I was gobsmacked.'","Frank Jones grew plants worth £12,000 from seed in Yorkshire home .

Caoimhe Neeson, 3, pictured with mother Joe-Anne, has been diagnosed with a fast-growing, malignant brain tumour . A mother is desperately trying to raise £250,000 for an operation in the U.S. after her daughter was turned down for a life-saving op on the NHS. Joe-Anne Neeson needs the cash to send three-year-old Caoimhe to the US for cancer treatment that could help prolong her life. Caoimhe was diagnosed with a fast-growing, malignant brain tumour in February. Ms Neeson, 29, of Glasgow, said her daughter was vomiting up to 10 times a day for more than two months, had problems with her balance and agonising headaches before her diagnosis. She added: 'Caoimhe was a shell of herself by the time she was diagnosed. 'When they took me aside, they said she had a growth and I asked if it was cancerous. It was a relief in a strange way.' Days after her cancer was diagnosed, Caoimhe was on the operating table. However, surgeons were unable to remove all of the tumour, because of its size and location. 'It’s such a fast growing aggressive tumour. If they had caught it before they might have been able to remove it all.' After the surgery Caoimhe, who has an 11-year-old brother Corrie, was left unable to talk and walk but has amazed medics and her family by regaining her mobility and her speech. Yet her mother has been told there is . only a 40 per cent chance Caoimhe will survive to her fith birthday. It . is thought the cancer may also have spread to her spine. Caoimhe has been turned down for NHS . funding for Proton Therapy, a targeted form of radiotherapy which is . offered by a number of hospitals in the US. Her mother is desperately trying to raise £250,000 for an operation in the U.S. after her daughter was turned down for life-saving treatment on the NHS . Doctors have said there is only a 40 per cent chance Caoimhe, diagnosed in February, will survive to her fifth birthday. It is thought the cancer may also have spread to her spine . Meanwhile the family is desperately trying to raise the £250,000. She is currently being treated with chemotherapy at Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children. This has stabilised the cancer but it is likely to return in a more aggressive form. Ms Neeson and her best friend Jaclyn Smith, 28, have launched a fundraising campaign to send Caoimhe to the U.S. for Proton Therapy, which delivers a more precise dose of radiation without killing healthy tissue surrounding the tumour. Conventional radiation could leave her severely mentally impaired. 'We know she is going to need radiation and Proton radiation is targeted - it’s like the difference between a shotgun blast or a sniper,' explained Ms Neeson . 'But here the conventional type is the only option and that’s going to leave her with no quality of life. 'We were turned down for treatment as they said Caoimhe was a very complex case, and because it’s so advanced. 'It all rests on the money and we have to do everything we can.' Ms Neeson and her best friend Jaclyn Smith (right) are hoping to raise sufficient funds to take Caoimhe to the US for Proton Therapy, a treatment not available in the UK . Decisions to send paediatric patients to America for Proton Therapy are not taken by individual health authorities. Instead, each case is individually assessed by a UK panel of cancer specialists who determine if patients meet the criteria for treatment. The little girl's mother also believes that an earlier diagnosis might have helped her daughter and has made a complaint to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. She claims Caoimhe was originally treated for a bowel obstruction and given laxatives. 'She presented with every symptom of a brain tunmour - dizziness, vomiting, balance problems - and they failed to diagnose it.. She was sick every day for 68 days. 'They kept sending me home with her. I looked at her symptoms online and brain tumour kept coming up.' An investigation has been launched by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde into Caoimhe’s care. A spokeswoman for NHSGGC Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “We have received a complaint from the patient’s mother. We are looking into the concerns that she raised with us and will respond to her direct.'","Caoimhe Neeson has been diagnosed with a fast-growing brain tumour .

Transgender convicts are set to get their own wing in an L.A. women's jail in what is believed to be an unprecedented move. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) will begin housing arrested transgender men and women in the city’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) by the end of the month. The announcement was made by Captain Dave Lindsay, commander of the department's jail division, in a speech to transgender people in Hollywood yesterday. Transgender arrestees will be detained in a wing all their own at the women's Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) from the end of the month . One of the sections in the center, which houses male and female inmates, will be reserved for up to 24 transgender people. It comes on the back of a new LAPD policy with new guidelines on interacting with members of the transgender community during stop and searches. The policy was spelt out in a memo issued to all department personnel, telling officers to 'respect the expressed gender and do not question it'. In the memo, it cautions officers to think twice before calling a member of the transgender community 'sir' or 'ma'am'. The memo also banned officers from frisking people or questioning them to solely learn their anatomical gender. Women's jail: Transgender arrestees will get their own wing at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) from the end of the month . Capt. Lindsay claimed it 'is a major change' that will allow for 'an environment that's safe and secure, as there's been a history of violence against transgender people' in jail, according to the L.A. Times. Karina Samala, director of the Transgender Working Group, which has been discussing changes in police policy and regulations with LAPD officials since 2007, said: 'We've pushed for this.' City jails are designed for holding people until they appear in court to face the charges for which they were arrested - typically a maximum of three days. They are then transferred to the LA County Jail, run by the Sheriff’s Department. The planned changes do not apply to the county jail.

At the new module in the city, transgender people will have their own area and be able to receive male and female clothing and medical treatment, including hormones, Lindsay added.","The move is believed to be the first of its kind in the US, according to police officials .

President Obama and his family will attend this year’s annual ‘Christmas in Washington Concert,’ where Korean rapping sensation PSY is slated to perform, despite controversy surrounding the ‘Gangnam Style’ singer’s anti-American protests several years ago. PSY, born Park Jae-sang, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame following his 'sexy-horse dance,' rapped at a 2004 protest concert to ‘kill those f****** Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives…kill them all slowly and painfully.’ The rapper apologized last week for using what he said was 'inflammatory and inappropriate language' during anti-U.S. protests at concerts in 2002 and 2004. Still on: PSY, pictured performing yesterday in Miami, will still perform in tonight's 'Christmas in Washington' concert, slated to air on TNT December 21 . In attendance: The Obamas, pictured at last week's annual tree-lighting ceremony, are still going to this year's 'Christmas in Washington' concert . The song, ‘Dear American,’ was written by South Korean metal band N.E.X.T. Mr Obama traditionally attends the 'Christmas in Washington' concert of carols and songs to benefit Children's National Medical Center. The 31st installment is scheduled for Sunday evening at the National Building Museum, and to be hosted for a second year by comedian Conan O'Brien. Other scheduled performers include Diana Ross, Demi Lovato, ‘American Idol’ alum Scotty McCreery, Chris Mann of 'The Voice' fame, and 'Smash' star Megan Hilty. In a statement, the rapper said Friday: 'While I'm grateful for the freedom to express one's self, I've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted. 'I will forever be sorry for any pain I have caused by those words,' he added. In one performance, which PSY said was from eight years ago, the rapper protested the deaths of two teenage South Korean girls who were run over by a U.S. tank stationed in the country. Protesting: PSY, with his face painted gold, posed with a model of an camouflaged tank during the 2002 anti-war demonstrations in Seoul . Outrage: PSY was seen violently smashing the model on stage . In a separate performance, PSY was critical of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and its occupation, in which South Korean forces participated. The concert, which films today, is scheduled to air December 21 on TNT. Last week, the president was being urged to boycott the 'Christmas in Washington' show and critics were demanding the 34-year-old South Korean pop star be uninvited after his controversial concerts of the past. But TNT said that despite the furor, PSY will still close the annual event and the Obamas would be in attendance. The rap sensation's graphic 2004 . anti-American song sparked an angry petition on the White House website . urging organizers of the event, which will be pre-recorded this Sunday, . to scratch him from the line up. 'I've learned there are limits to what language is . appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be . interpreted.

According to  Radar Online, the environmental lawyer, 58, is planning to propose to Hines, 47, who is famous for playing Larry David's wife in Curb Your Enthusiasm. Kennedy's second wife, Mary, was found hanging in the family barn in Bedford, New York, in May this year - he had filed for divorce in 2010. Coming engagement: Robert F Kennedy Jr is reportedly ready to propose to actress girlfriend Cheryl Hines . 'Robert has already bought an absolutely stunning engagement ring and is now in the stages of planning the perfect scenario in which to propose to Cheryl,' a source said. 'He knows she is the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with and he wants to seal the deal as soon as possible and prove to her how serious he is.' The source claims that 'Robert is aware that it hasn't even been a year yet since Mary killed herself and he doesn't want Cheryl to be subjected to any negative backlash, she's an innocent party in this whole mess and he wants to shield her from any criticism as much as humanly possible.' Radar adds: 'His and Mary's divorce was . close to being finalized at the time of her death, and Robert says he . would have likely already married Cheryl by now if he didn't have to . deal with the suicide and its aftermath.

The Australian radio station that made the hoax call that preceded the apparent suicide of nurse Jacintha Saldanha is to donate $500,000 (£326,000) from its advertising profits to her family. Sydney-based 2Day FM again expressed 'deep regret' over the death of Miss Saldanha, which took place shortly after she fell for the trick by two DJs at King Edward VII Hospital in London. The radio station's owners had cancelled all of its advertising after broadcasting the call, in which Mel Greig and Michael Christian pretended to be royals checking up on the Duchess of Cambridge, who was being treated for acute morning sickness. Bereft: All the profits from the radio station's advertising will be donated to nurse Jacintha Saldanha's family. Pictured centre, her husband Benedict Barboza visits Westminster yesterday with their children Lisha, left, 14, and Junal, right, 16 . Tragic: Miss Saldanha died after being duped into believing she was talking to the Queen about the welfare of the Duchess of Cambridge, who was in King Edward VII Hospital with acute morning sickness . There had been talk of 2Day FM shutting down completely, but instead owners Southern Cross Austereo said advertising will now resume and all profits until the end of the year be donated to a fund that will directly benefit Miss Saldanha's family. The company said the family could expect to receive a 'minimum contribution' of $500,000. Rhys Holleran, the company's chief executive officer, repeated how sorry they were for what had happened. 'It is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts continue to be with the family. 'We hope that by contributing to a memorial fund we can help to provide the Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time. 'The company today reiterates that it is deeply saddened by this tragic and unforeseen event and offers its condolences to the family of Jacintha Saldanha.' The announcement follows a decision by Austereo today to cancel the 2Day FM's Christmas party out of respect for Miss Saldanha, and donate the cash to two Australian charities that handle emotional, life threatening problems. Christmas party cancelled: The DJs who made the call - Michael Christian and Mel Greig - appear on TV yesterday to explain their actions . As much as £8,000 had been set aside to entertain between 200 and 250 of the radio station's staff, before executives decided the party would be inappropriate. Before the nurse's death, Mr Christian said he expected the hoax would be the highlight of his career, and might have expected jubilant celebration at the end of year party. Instead, a company spokesperson said today: 'Cancellation of the party was entirely out of respect for the nurse, Jacintha Saldanha, and her family. This is not a time for celebration at the radio station.' The party was due to be held at a trendy nightclub called the Oxford Art Factory on Sydney's popular nightlife strip, Oxford Street. Lord Glenarthur, chairman of the hospital where Miss Saldanha worked, today welcomed news of Southern Cross Media Group's donation to the family. He said: 'Jacintha Saldanha was an outstanding nurse who was much loved by everyone at King Edward VII’s Hospital. 'After discussion with her family, we have established the Jacintha Saldanha Memorial Fund to benefit her husband and children at this difficult time. I am pleased to announce that many donations have already been made from around the world. 'I have today read that Southern Cross Media Group have pledged to make a minimum donation of $500,000 Australian Dollars to an appropriate fund. We would certainly welcome such a donation.'","2Day FM had cancelled all advertising, but will now bring ti back and donate profits to family .
