"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A friend of supermodel Naomi Campbell handed over unpolished diamonds to South African police the day that Campbell testified at a war crimes trial for former Liberian President Charles Taylor, police said Friday. Police spokesman Musa Zondi told CNN that the diamonds are real. Campbell testified Thursday at a United Nations-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone that she had received the diamonds as a gift, then turned them over to her friend Jeremy Ratcliffe to auction for charity. She said on the stand she believed Ratcliffe still had the stones. Zondi said Ratcliffe could face charges of possession of unpolished diamonds. Campbell said she was handed the stones following a dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela in 1997. ""When I was sleeping, I had a knock on my door. I opened the door and two men were there. They gave me a pouch and said, 'A gift for you,'"" the supermodel testified. The men didn't introduce themselves or say anything else, Campbell said. The next morning, she opened the pouch and saw a few ""very small, dirty-looking stones."" Prosecutors are trying to prove that Taylor used so-called blood diamonds to fuel a brutal civil war in neighboring Sierra Leone. Taylor, 62, was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the civil war in Sierra Leone, fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior, and often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, sexual slavery and violence, and enslavement. He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors had rested their case against Taylor in February 2009 but reopened it to call Campbell to testify after learning in June of that year that Taylor had given the supermodel a diamond. When arguing to reopen the case, prosecutors said Campbell's testimony would prove that the former president ""used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases,"" according to papers filed with the U.N.-backed court. Taylor has testified that he never handled the precious stones. Campbell told the tribunal Thursday that she shared the story of receiving the stones with her former agent Carol White and the actress Mia Farrow at breakfast the following morning. ""Well, that's obviously Charles Taylor,"" one of them said. Campbell didn't recall who said it. Then, one of them added, ""Well, obviously, they are diamonds."" Campbell said she assumed the stones came from Taylor. Campbell said passed the stones to her friend, Jeremy Ratcliffe, and asked him to use the stones in a charity auction to raise money for underprivileged children. Ratcliffe is a trustee of the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which denied hours after Campbell's testimony that it had ever received diamonds from her. iReporter: ""Campbell took her ignorance to new heights"" Future witnesses at the war crimes trial are likely to dispute Campbell's story, prosecutors said after her testimony. ""Two other witnesses will also testify about these events.... there are significant differences between those accounts and Ms. Campbell's account,"" the prosecution said in a statement. It did not name the witnesses, but court papers show prosecutors plan to call Carol White and Mia Farrow.","Supermodel Naomi Campbell testified Thursday at a war crimes trial .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A remote-controlled roadside bomb ripped through a bus transporting Turkish military personnel and their families to a gendarmerie paramilitary base in Istanbul on Tuesday. Turkish authorities say three gendarmerie sergeants and the 17-year-old daughter of a member of the security forces were killed in the attack. A fourth wounded sergeant died in hospital hours after the bomb blast, an official at Istanbul's TEM Hospital told CNN, raising the death toll to five. ""It was a remote-controlled, fragmentation bomb that was left on the side of the road,"" said Huseyin Avni Mutlu, the governor of Istanbul, in a televised appearance broadcast live from the scene of the explosion. ""This is a terrorist act."" The bomb attack took place in the western, European side of the city. Mutlu said the device hit the third and last of a three-bus convoy that was traveling to the Istanbul Province Gendarmerie Command Center. CNN Turk, CNN's sister network, broadcast images of the white civilian passenger bus standing in the middle of the road, with purple curtains blowing through shattered windows. The network also showed video of a man dressed in civilian clothes bleeding from the stomach, being loaded into an ambulance. A splinter Kurdish nationalist group, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement posted on the internet. ""All military forces and groups, bureaucratic persons who have a role in this racist war against Kurdish people are our target,"" said the statement, which was released on the pro-Kurdish web-site, the Firat News Agency. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons are a splinter group from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a movement of Marxist Kurdish guerrillas who have been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s. Tuesday's deadly explosion comes at a time when the 26-year conflict between Turkish security forces and Kurdish PKK militants is once again flaring. Last week, a top Turkish army general announced the PKK was increasing the frequency of its attacks. General Fahri Kir said the militants are trying to expand operations beyond south-eastern, predominantly Kurdish-populated Turkey. PKK militants are making no secret of their threats to widen the battlefield in Turkey. ""If the military operations and the political operations do not stop against the guerrillas and the Kurdish people, the actions of the PKK will spread to the cities as well,"" said PKK spokesman Roj Welat, in a telephone call to CNN from northern Iraq. The PKK has been battling the Turkish government since the early 1980s. Initially, the movement fought to carve out a separate homeland for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority, which makes up nearly 18 percent of the Turkish population, according to the CIA World Factbook. More then 30,000 people, mostly ethnic Kurds, have been killed during the conflict.  In recent years, the rebels say they have given up their demands for an independent Kurdish state, and are instead fighting for more linguistic and cultural freedoms. Though the Kurds represent Turkey's largest ethnic minority, their language has historically been suppressed by the Turkish state, which long referred to Kurds as ""mountain Turks."" Twelve Turkish troops were killed in eastern Turkey last weekend during clashes with rebels along the border with Iraq. According to the Turkish military, at least 55 Turkish security forces have been killed in fighting with the PKK since the beginning of March. Turkish authorities said they were investigating links between Tuesday's roadside bomb and a similar, less deadly bombing that targeted a police bus in the same Halkali district of Istanbul on June 8. Fifteen police officers were injured in that attack. When asked about the previous police bus blast, Istanbul Police Chief Huseyin Capkin said there may be a connection. He added that authorities were investigating the possible link.","NEW: 5 killed in Istanbul bus bombing .

"For the next two months, Australian polar explorer Eric Philips will be guiding the crew aboard the Greenpeace ship, the ""Arctic Sunrise."" They're navigating the waters around Greenland to chart the impact of climate change. Philips filed this blog as part of CNN's special ""Going Green."" PETERMANN GLACIER, Greenland -- I'm writing this blog from Petermann Glacier in northwest Greenland, where a cold katabatic wind is blowing off the ice onto the deck of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. A polar bear checks its reflection in the Robeson channel, near the border between Greenland and Canada. The ship is here on a scientific research mission, and to document the effects of climate warming on the world's largest island and second largest icecap. I'm on board as the expedition safety guide, which means making sure that everyone venturing off the ship is well-equipped and well-informed for dealing with conditions in the harsh and remote Arctic wilderness. While it's exciting to work beside world-class scientists such as ice-sheet climatologist Jason Box, glaciologist Alun Hubbard and geophysicist Richard Bates, it's equally disheartening to be here bearing witness to the catastrophic events they record.  Watch Eric Philip's video blog Â» . Each year I guide ski expeditions across the pack ice to the North Geographic Pole and each year brings new surprises -- severe storms rarely seen in these parts, vast tracts of first-year ice where there should be years of accumulation, pack ice drifting faster and farther than ever before. The veneer of fractured ice over the Arctic Ocean is changing, disintegrating before my eyes. Over the last twenty years more than 5000 kilometers of ice has passed beneath my skis during numerous expeditions to both poles, as well as treks across Greenland, Spitsbergen, Iceland, Ellesmere Island and the Patagonian Icecap. Add to this multiple voyages and flights to both Antarctica and the Arctic and I have come to feel part of the polar landscape. I've developed somewhat of a polar sense, and I sense there is something afoot that I don't much like. Never before has the channel between Ellesmere Island and Greenland been this ice-free in mid-summer; it's usually blocked with ice until August. Over the past week we've placed GPS trackers and time-lapse cameras on and around the Petermann Glacier, in anticipation of it losing a piece of ice around 100 square kilometers in size. Massive cracks are spearing across the ""tongue"" of this enormous floating ice shelf (16km wide and 80km long) heralding one of the biggest glacier calvings ever recorded in the northern hemisphere.  See photos of the Petermann Glacier Â» . With the ice shelf no longer able to hold back the rest of glacier, that means more fresh water sliding into the ocean. Broadly speaking, the warmer the climate, the greater the melt. This phenomenon is happening not just at Petermann, but at glaciers worldwide, contributing to sea level rise. We'll be in Greenland for the next two months, during which time this Greenpeace-supported initiative will all but circumnavigate the island. As well as doing a lot of funky innovative science, we'll be using the expedition to get politicians to take some responsibility for curbing emissions. This week, world leaders are meeting up in Italy for the G8. It's a real -- and possibly the last -- opportunity for them to take a stand on climate change in the run up to this December's climate meeting in Copenhagen, by making cuts of 40 percent in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries. My dual homelands are Australia and the Arctic -- the latter is showing the strain of climate change more than anywhere else, but Australia is suffering too, with droughts in the south and flooding in the north. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will be at the G8 meeting, as will President Obama and other heads of state. Let's hope they don't squander this important opportunity to make deep and lasting commitments to curbing climate change.","Scientists on board ""Arctic Sunrise"" are charting impact of climate change .

"Argyll, Scotland (CNN) -- Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow was enjoying a pint at his local pub in the Scottish Highlands when he got an idea that would change his life -- and the lives of thousands of others. It was 1992, and MacFarlane-Barrow and his brother Fergus had just seen a news report about refugee camps in Bosnia. The images of people suffering in the war-torn country shocked the two salmon farmers, who'd visited there as teenagers and remembered the warmth of the Bosnian people. ""We began saying 'Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just do one small thing to help?' "" MacFarlane-Barrow says. After talking it over, the two men took a week off work and collected food, clothing, medicine and blankets. They loaded everything into an old Land Rover, drove to Bosnia to deliver it and returned to Scotland. ""I came back here thinking that I did my one good deed and it would be back to work, but it [didn't work] out like that, "" he says. When they arrived home, the brothers found an avalanche of goods that people had continued to donate while they were away. ""I was touched by the overwhelming generosity of others,"" MacFarlane-Barrow remembers. ""I saw all of those donations in our family home and thought, 'Wow, people really are good,' and it inspired me to be good too."" After much thought and prayer, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow quit his job, sold his home and dedicated himself to helping people in need. He returned to Bosnia with aid 22 more times during the Bosnian War, and over the next 18 years his work expanded and evolved. Today, his program -- Mary's Meals, named after the Virgin Mary -- provides free daily meals to more than 400,000 children around the world. MacFarlane-Barrow found his current focus in 2002 while working in Malawi -- a country ravaged by famine and AIDS -- when he met a local teenager who just wanted a decent meal and an education. ""The mother of the family was dying of AIDS. She was lying on her bare mud floor, and she had her six children around her, "" he says. ""I started talking to her oldest child, Edward. And Edward said, 'I'd like to have enough food to eat. I'd like to go to school one day.' "" In response, he launched Mary's Meals, which strives to break the cycle of poverty by feeding children a daily meal at school. The food -- in most places a mug of maize-based porridge -- gives students an incentive to continue their schooling and helps them focus better on their studies. It's a formula that MacFarlane-Barrow says is working. ""Pass rates go up dramatically in the schools where we start providing Mary's Meals,"" he says. ""We've seen huge improvements in attendance rates and academic performance."" Mary's Meals partners with local residents, who handle the daily work of cooking and serving the food. In Malawi -- the group's largest effort -- more than 10,000 volunteers donate their time on a regular basis. The program operates in more than 500 schools and child-care facilities in 15 countries, a global effort that MacFarlane-Barrow coordinates from a tin shed on his parents' property in Scotland. While the married father of six lives on the property, he spends most of his time abroad, overseeing the project and visiting the schools where meals are served. ""I see the children's faces as they eat their meal, "" he says. ""Knowing I can transform their lives keeps me motivated."" But there are always new challenges to overcome, most recently in Haiti, where Mary's Meals has operated since 2006. Working in partnership with a local Catholic priest, the group was feeding about 12,000 children a day when the earthquake hit in January. Much of the infrastructure the program relied on in the slums of Cite Soleil was destroyed, so the group's mission expanded. They helped create temporary classrooms and are rebuilding eight schools in the area. In addition to their school-based feeding program, the group now feeds about 2,000 elderly Haitians and is providing additional food and medicine to the community. MacFarlane-Barrow is driven by his Christian faith, but there is no ministry aspect to his work. ""We are very careful to never link feeding and faith,"" he says. ""We serve those who are in need ... period. ""When I think of Mary's Meals I think of it as a series of lots and lots of little acts of love, "" he says. ""I've learned ... that every small act of kindness does make a difference."" Want to get involved?

"Washington (CNN) -- A controversial and leading U.S. general is in line to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates. U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis -- if he wins presidential and Senate approval -- will move from being the outgoing commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command to leading the U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. The command also monitors Iran. He would take over the post left open by the departure of Gen. David Petraeus, who was asked to take over command of the war in Afghanistan. Mattis was an effective leader in the Marine Corps, in the eyes of the Pentagon, while commanding troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Known for his straight talk and hard-core leadership of Marines in the 2004 battle of Falluja, Iraq, Mattis is considered a dark-horse pick by many in the halls of the Pentagon. His blunt talk has gotten him in trouble: In 2005 he said, ""It's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them,"" referring to Afghan fighters. Asked if the general would be an effective leader for the Central Command region with the shadow of the comments still lingering, Gates said Thursday, ""Appropriate action was taken at the time. I think that the subsequent five years have demonstrated that the lesson was learned."" ""Obviously, in the wake of the Rolling Stone interview, we discussed this kind of thing. And I have every confidence that General Mattis will respond to questions and speak publicly about the matters for which he is responsible in an entirely appropriate way,"" Gates said. The Rolling Stone interview led to the resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, then the commander in Afghanistan, because of negative comments about Obama administration officials made by him and his aides. Mattis' comment in 2005 was made when the then-three-star general was in a panel discussion before an audience. ""Actually, it's quite fun to fight them, you know. It's a hell of a hoot,"" he said, prompting laughter from some military members in the audience. ""It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling,"" he said. ""You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,"" he said. ""You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them."" The commandant of the Marine Corps at the time, Gen. Michael Hagee, counseled Mattis about the remarks but defended him publicly, calling him ""one of this country's bravest and most experienced military leaders."" ""While I understand that some people may take issue with the comments made by him, I also know he intended to reflect the unfortunate and harsh realities of war,"" he said in a written statement. ""Lt. Gen. Mattis often speaks with a great deal of candor."" Mattis also was the commanding general overseeing the case of the now-infamous slayings of civilians by Marines in Haditha, Iraq. Some 24 civilians were killed on November 19, 2005, in what a human rights group and military prosecutors said was a house-to-house rampage by Marines after a roadside bomb killed one of their comrades. Eight Marines were charged, and all but one were cleared, some of them by Mattis. Mattis also was the overseeing authority in the murder case involving eight Marines found guilty of taking part in a plot to drag an Iraqi man from his home, kill him and then make it look like the man was an insurgent. That incident occurred near the western Iraqi town of Hamdania in April 2006. Mattis later cut the sentences of at least two of the Marines involved in the plot. Mattis had been preparing to retire after finishing his latest command, Gates said. ""General Mattis is one of our military's outstanding combat leaders and strategic thinkers, bringing an essential mix of experience, judgment and perspective to this important post,"" Gates said. ""General Mattis has proven to be one of the military's most innovative and iconoclastic thinkers. His insights into the nature of warfare in the 21st century have influenced my own views about how the armed forces must be shaped and postured for the future.""","Gen. James Mattis recommended as next Central Command leader .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon denied Thursday it has approved sending the aircraft carrier USS George Washington to the Yellow Sea off the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea allegedly sank a South Korean warship in March. Two U.S. military officials said U.S. Forces Korea was expected to make the announcement Thursday. The officials declined to speak on the record because the announcement had not been made. But Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told CNN, ""No carriers are going anywhere near there anytime soon."" However, the military officials are planning for the deployment and said they expect it to be announced. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday he was not aware of a plan to send the carrier to waters off South Korea. The U.S. military is conducting exercises with the South Koreans, and some additional exercises are under discussion, Gates said, but no decisions have been made. The carrier deployment would come as the U.S. Navy and Republic of Korea warships are scheduled to conduct a joint naval exercise that the two nations vowed to undertake in response to the alleged North Korean attack on the South Korean ship. It's not clear to what extent the aircraft carrier will be part of that exercise. The carrier is expected to be accompanied by a U.S. destroyer and submarine, the officials said. The U.S. ships plan to conduct exercises separate from those previously announced. But the move is considered to be sending a signal to North Korea about the U.S. commitment to defending South Korea. The Navy sent a carrier to the Yellow Sea last year for exercises, considered an unusual move because it had been several years since that had happened, one of the officials said. North Korea is blamed for a torpedo attack on a South Korean navy vessel, the Cheonan. Forty-six sailors were killed.","Pentagon denies aircraft carrier being sent to Korean Peninsula .

"(CNN) -- A warden and a security official have resigned their posts at an Arizona state prison where three inmates escaped last month, a spokesman for the private company that runs the facility said Sunday. Unit Warden Lori Lieder and an unidentified unit security chief resigned last week from Arizona State Prison -- Kingman, according to Carl Stuart, a spokesman for Management & Training Corp. The resignations come amid a nationwide search for the last of the three escaped inmates, John McCluskey, and his alleged accomplice, Casslyn Mae Welch. McCluskey, 45, was serving a 15-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder and other charges when he and fellow convicts Tracy Province and Daniel Renwick broke out of the prison July 30, allegedly with Welch's help. Welch, who was on the visitation list for one of the inmates, threw cutting tools over a prison fence, according to Charles Ryan, director of Arizona's Department of Corrections. Ryan has noted some ""operational security problems"" at the prison. ""Those are being evaluated and investigated as we speak,"" he said earlier this month. Renwick, 36, was captured August 1 in a shootout with police in Rifle, Colorado. He was serving 22 years for second-degree murder when he escaped. Province, 42, was rearrested Monday in Meeteetse, Wyoming, near Yellowstone National Park when authorities were notified by a local resident who sat and talked with Province a day earlier on the steps of a church in town. He was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. Renwick remains in the Garfield County, Colorado, Jail on charges of attempted first-degree murder and eluding police, the U.S. Marshals Service said Sunday. Authorities are working to coordinate the transport of Province back to Arizona from Wyoming -- expected to occur within the next month, the marshals service said. Meanwhile, the hunt for McCluskey and Welch continued in western Montana and along the border with Canada, the marshals service said. The last credible sighting of the pair occurred August 6 in Billings, Montana, the marshals service said. A reward of up to $35,000 is being offered for information that leads to their arrests. McCluskey is believed to have dyed his hair dark and grown a beard and Welch may have blonde hair. ""All information indicates McCluskey and Welch are still traveling together and should be considered armed and extremely dangerous,"" the marshals service said in a news release. ""It is likely they are reacting, rather than taking deliberate action. As the manhunt protracts, it is highly possible they will become more desperate, creating increased danger to law enforcement and the general public. If they are encountered, call local law enforcement immediately."" McCluskey and Welch are also suspected in the killings of a couple whose bodies were found in their burned out camper earlier this month in New Mexico, according to authorities. Authorities said they are likely driving a gray, gold or tan 1997 Nissan Sentra, though both are experienced semitruck drivers known to have frequented truck stops, rest areas and campgrounds.","A warden and a security official resigned last week, a prison spokesman says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide car bomber killed at least 56 people and wounded more than 100 others Friday when his vehicle exploded in a market in Mohmand Agency in Pakistan's tribal region, officials said.

"(CNN) -- Boston police have seized almost a ton of marijuana in the city's largest such haul in recent memory, according to Suffolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Daniel F. Conley. Edgar Gonzalez, 40, was arraigned Thursday in Dorchester District Court, accused of trafficking in marijuana. He also is being held in connection with an immigration violation by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, according to a news release from District Attorney Conley. Conviction on the drug charge is punishable by up to 15 years in state prison. Boston police were originally conducting a separate search Wednesday when they witnessed what they described as a suspicious man fleeing from a building, according to the release from the district attorney. Police intercepted the man, identified as Gonzalez, and noticed the door to his apartment was open. Because of an existing immigration detainment order by U.S. Customs and Immigrations Enforcement as well as his behavior in trying to flee, officers were able to conduct a ""protective sweep"" of his residence, authorities said. In the apartment police found 40 large bales of marijuana wrapped in plastic, according to the press release. After obtaining a search warrant for Gonzalez's apartment, police seized the marijuana -- weighing about 2,000 pounds, or one ton -- as well as scales, a vacuum sealer and shrink wrap. Police also seized a Dominican Republic passport, authorities said. Gonzalez's attorney, Holly Clarke, did not return calls from CNN. Gonzalez was being held with bail set at $1 million, authorities said. His trial date is set for June 30 in Dorchester District Court.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish authorities have arrested 13 people in connection with blasts that killed 17 people in Istanbul last week, Interior Minister Besir Atalay said Saturday. Video from last week's bombing in Istanbul shows bloodied people being loaded into ambulances. Of those arrested, 10 were sent to judicial court, Atalay said in a televised news conference. He described the attack as the ""work of the bloody separatist group,"" but did not identify a group by name. No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, which went off within minutes of each other in Istanbul's crowded Gungoren community. About 154 people were wounded, state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Istanbul Gov. Muammer Guler, who called the blasts ""an act of terror,"" said last week that the explosive devices were placed 15 meters (49 feet) from each other. The first was a stun grenade that was detonated to draw attention before the second blast went off, he said. The other, a bomb, had been placed in a trash can. Turkey -- a candidate for European Union membership -- has pushed its anti-terror campaign on multiple fronts. Tensions between  Turkey Â» and Kurdish rebels have risen over the Kurdistan Workers' Party's increasing attacks and Turkey's subsequent crackdown. The rebels, known as the PKK, have waged a decades-long battle for an autonomous Kurdish region in Turkey's southeast. Last month, 86 people -- including former military officials, journalists, politicians and businessmen -- were indicted on charges of being involved with an alleged terror group called Ergenekon, which aims to topple the Turkish government. The arrests and indictments dramatize the sharp and serious political tensions between the country's Islam-rooted ruling party -- the Justice and Development Party, or AKP -- and its outspoken critics from the nation's secularist population.","Attack was conducted by ""bloody separatist group,"" Interior minister says .

"Washington (CNN) -- While the first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha were away for part of the weekend, President Barack Obama enjoyed what some have jokingly referred to as a bachelor's weekend with friends -- golfing, playing basketball and grilling out on the South Lawn. The festivities were all part of a belated birthday celebration of sorts for the president, who turned 49 on Wednesday. First lady Michelle Obama and youngest daughter Sasha, 9, returned from a vacation in Spain on Sunday in time to join the president for a seafood barbecue on the South Lawn. The Obamas' 12-year-old daughter, Malia, has been attending camp. Tables set up with white and yellow linens and adorned with centerpieces of lemons and limes dotted the lawn. The menu included shrimp from the Gulf Coast, where the seafood industry has been hard-hit by the BP oil disaster, according to White House aide Katie Hogan. Friends from Hawaii, Chicago, Illinois, and college joined the president on Saturday at Andrews Air Force Base for a round of golf. The sports outings continued Sunday with a basketball game at Fort McNair where Obama -- along with such NBA stars as LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Grant Hill and Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson -- played in front of an audience of wounded servicemen and participants in the White House mentoring program.

"Panama City, Florida (CNN) -- President Barack Obama told CNN Saturday that in defending the right of Muslims to build a community center and mosque near ground zero in a speech on Friday night, he was ""not commenting on the wisdom"" of the project. Instead, Obama said he was trying to uphold the broader principle that the government should treat ""everyone equal, regardless"" of religion. His comments were seen as step back from the support he appeared to give the controversial project during a White House dinner on Friday, though a spokesman for the administration quickly moved to clarify the president's remarks. ""Just to be clear, the President is not backing off in any way from the comments he made last night,"" White House spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement Saturday afternoon. ""It is not his role as President to pass judgment on every local project. But it is his responsibility to stand up for the Constitutional principle of religious freedom and equal treatment for all Americans,"" Burton added. Obama, speaking on Saturday after giving a speech on the Gulf Coast oil disaster in Panama City, Florida, told CNN he ""was not commenting and I will not comment on the wisdom of making the decision to put a mosque there,"" referring to the area near ground zero. ""I was commenting very specifically on the right people have that dates back to our founding,"" the president added. ""In this country, we treat everybody equally and in accordance with the law, regardless of race, regardless of religion."" At a White House dinner celebrating the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Obama seemed to throw his support behind a controversial proposal to build an Islamic center and mosque near New York's ground zero, saying Friday that ""Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country."" ""That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances,"" Obama said. The president's remarks drew praise from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who announced his support for the Islamic center last week. Bloomberg compared Obama's speech to a letter former President George Washington wrote in support of a Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode Island. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-New York), whose district includes ground zero, praised Obama's remarks on Saturday. ""The United States was founded on the principle of religious liberty and tolerance, and it is equally important 234 years later that we uphold this principal. Hate should have no place in America,"" Nadler said in a statement. Still, critics of the proposed Islamic center -- including Sarah Palin and Rep. Peter King (R-New York) -- quickly denounced Obama's comments. ""President Obama is wrong,"" King said in a statement Friday night. ""It is insensitive and uncaring for the Muslim community to build a mosque in the shadow of Ground Zero. Unfortunately, the President caved into political correctness."" Sarah Palin, the former Republican candidate for vice president, also weighed in. ""We all know that they have the right to do it, but should they?"" she tweeted on Saturday. Obama, who on Friday said he was speaking both as a citizen and as president, invoked the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which critics of the Islamic center cite as the main reason for blocking its construction. ""We must all recognize and respect the sensitivities surrounding the development of lower Manhattan,"" he said. ""The 9/11 attacks were a deeply traumatic event for our country."" ""The pain and suffering experienced by those who lost loved ones is unimaginable,"" Obama continued. ""So I understand the emotions that this issue engenders. Ground zero is, indeed, hallowed ground."" The proposed Islamic center has provoked vocal opposition from some families of 9/11 victims and other groups. Nearly 70 percent of Americans oppose the plan, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll released Wednesday. ""In a breathtakingly inappropriate setting, the president has chosen to declare our memories of 9/11 obsolete and the sanctity of Ground Zero finished,"" Debra Burlingame, co-founder of 9/11 Families for a Safe & Strong America, said in a statement. The Islamic center's leaders say they plan to build the $100 million, 13-story facility called Cordoba House three blocks from the site of the 9/11 attacks. The developer, Sharif El-Gamal, describes the project as an ""Islamic community center"" that would include a 500-seat performing arts center, a lecture hall, a swimming pool, a gym, a culinary school, a restaurant and a prayer space for Muslims. Other families of 9/11 victims said they support the proposed Islamic center, and the president's position. ""America, the concept and the people and the land thrive when we chose to trust in our principles rather than cave to our basest fears,"" Donna Marsh O'Connor, spokeswoman for September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, said in a statement. ""What better place for healing, reconciliation and understanding than Ground Zero?"" she added. On Wednesday, the project's developers declined an offer by New York Gov. David Paterson to relocate the project to a state-owned site. Earlier this month, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously denied landmark status for the building where the proposed Islamic center would stand, allowing the project to move forward.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Desperation erupted into violence Tuesday in flood-ravaged Pakistan as survivors who have yet to receive aid scrambled to put food in their empty bellies. People in Sindh province blocked a highway to protest the slowness of aid delivery and clashed with police, the United Nations said. In a hard-hit district of Punjab, hungry mobs unloaded two aid trucks headed to a warehouse. Local aid agencies reported other incidents of looting. An aid agency worker said distributions were hampered because of the crowds stopping the convoys and because large numbers of people were living along the road. About 20 million people have been affected by the relentless monsoon rains that began falling three weeks ago, leading to massive flooding from the mountainous regions in the north to the river plains of the south. See high resoulution images of disaster . About one-fifth of Pakistan is submerged, and entire families waded through filthy water, pleading for help. More than 1,400 people have died. Health officials fear a second wave of fatalities from waterborne diseases, including cholera, which is endemic in Pakistan and now threatening to become a major outbreak. Up to 3.5 million children are at high risk of cholera and other deadly diseases like typhoid and dysentery, said Maurizio Giuliano of the United Nations' humanitarian affairs office. About 900,000 homes have been damaged, and the monsoon season is only about halfway over. Water is the villain here but can also be a savior: The only recourses from waterborne illnesses are clean water and medical care, but both are in short supply. The United Nations has called for $166 million for clean water and medical care but has received only $25 million. The World Bank has committed about $900 million at the request of the Pakistani government. According to a statement, funding will come from the bank's Fund for the Poorest through reprogramming of currently planned projects and reallocation of undisbursed funds from ongoing projects. The overall global response has not been nearly enough, according to an International Rescue Committee-chaired consortium called the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum. About $150 million had been received from nations around the world by Monday, the group said in a statement, but much more is needed. ""The international response to the disaster has been too small to even begin to effectively address the needs of survivors,"" said Tammy Hasselfeldt, the country director of the International Rescue Committee. ""The most urgent priority is to ensure that safe water as well as medicines are available, food supplies are restored and transportation networks fixed to accelerate the delivery of desperately needed aid."" The UN says $150 million is needed to feed up to 6 million Pakistanis, and $105 million is needed to help shelter about 2 million people left homeless. The United States has committed about $76 million for emergency flood relief assistance. But delivering the goods to flood victims is a nightmare in itself. With many roads and bridges reduced to rubble, travel by vehicles and foot is often impossible. The country is relying heavily on helicopters and boats to bring aid. ""We're putting the final pieces in place on a distribution system which can reach the huge number of people in need in the shortest possible time,"" said Wolfgang Herbinger, director of the United Nations' World Food Programme in Pakistan. ""It's a huge challenge, particularly in Sindh, where the delivery infrastructure is most constrained."" U.S. military helicopters delivered 2,500 pounds of relief supplies Tuesday and rescued 375 people. There are now 11 helicopters on the ground in Pakistan, but the Pentagon has ordered a total of 19 for flood relief efforts. Those efforts are costing the United States $300,000 a day, the Pentagon said. So far, $2.5 million has been spent. ""It's a dynamic situation,"" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. ""But the U.S. is a good ally and a friend, and we want to be supportive."" Families continue to stomp through mud carrying whatever belongings they can salvage, passing dead livestock, with nowhere to go. Despite their suffering, many flood victims are reluctant to leave the ruins of their homes because they fear having their land stolen. Amid the devastation, a bit of good news surfaced: The head engineer of the Sukkur barrage -- a dam whose strength was questioned as flood waters rose in the Indus River -- said the dam is considered safe. The river crested August 10, and the dam withstood the pressure.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- At least 31 people were dead after two days of torrential rains triggered flash floods in northwestern Turkey, sweeping cars into the sea and sending gushing water into homes and businesses, authorities said Wednesday. A Turkish woman awaits rescuers on her balcony following heavy morning rain in Istanbul. Twenty-six people were killed in Istanbul province and five in neighboring Tekirdag province, according to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Nine people were feared missing, he said. Among the fatalities in Istanbul were seven female textile workers who were trapped in their minivan, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. Witnesses in the city of Istanbul said the flash floods hit at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, washing through an industrial zone situated in a low-lying valley. Dozens of cargo trucks flipped or were ripped to pieces, the wreckage attracting crowds who watched the chaotic scene from nearby hilltops.  See photos of the devastation Â» . At a news conference in Istanbul's Disaster Management Center, in front of walls of TVs showing live video feeds from Turkey's largest city, Erdogan expressed condolences to families that lost loved ones during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

He said emergency workers rescued an estimated 1,300 people from the flash floods and pledged billions of Turkish lira for disaster relief in Istanbul and Tekirdag provinces. He also chided developers who built commercial and residential structures in riverbeds that are vulnerable to flooding. ""Our ancestors had a saying: 'The river's revenge will be heavy,' "" Erdogan said. ""We should remember what our ancestors said."" In the wake of this week's disaster, the prime minister called for relocating all such settlements from riverbeds and moving them to safer ground. Several roads in Istanbul city remained closed, including the airport road, CNN Turk said. Rescue missions were in full swing, with military helicopters whirring overhead. Residents were advised not to wander from their homes.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Nearly two months ago, President Obama embarked on a two-day, two-city charm offensive in Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country and NATO military ally whose people give the United States abysmal approval ratings. President Obama listens at a town hall-style meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, in April. The American president toured a mosque, laid a wreath at the grave of the founder of the Turkish republic, and announced before the Turkish parliament that ""the United States is not and will never be at war with Islam."" Did Obama's new brand of diplomacy work? Could 48 hours of handshakes, speeches and smiles turn around Turkish public opinion? After all, in 2007, only 9 percent of Turks polled by the Pew Research Center held favorable views of America, the lowest level among 47 countries surveyed. If 24-year old Ece Basaran is any indicator, Obama succeeded beyond expectations. After attending a town hall-style meeting with the American president during his visit to Istanbul last April, Basaran and a group of her friends started up a Turkish-American friendship club at her university. ""I get positive feedback because everybody around me likes Obama,"" Basaran said, while taking a break from preparing for final exams at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University this week. Basaran said that as recently as last year, the United States was unpopular among fellow students and friends, but added that ""after Obama, it seems popular. At least the negative image began to fade away."" Officials and commentators in both Turkey and the United States are also calling Obama's first presidential visit to a Muslim country a positive step. ""At the moment, he's doing the right thing,"" said Suat Kiniklioglu, a member of the Turkish parliament. ""His first task was to remedy the situation of America wielding a big stick for the last eight years."" ""President Obama's visit and recent policy initiatives have managed to dispel some of the pervasive suspicion in U.S.-Turkish relations -- no small achievement,"" said Ian Lesser of the German Marshall Fund, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month. But, he added, ""much remains to be done."" There are strong indications that words alone will not be enough to transform years of deep suspicion many Turks feel towards the United States, particularly after the long, widely unpopular war in neighboring Iraq. According to a recent poll published by academics at Bahcesehir University, 43 percent of Turks said they would not like to live next door to American neighbors. In a phone interview this week, Osman Solmaz, another of the Turkish students chosen to attend the town hall meeting with Obama, said that in his hometown, the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, ""the majority of the people have prejudice against the United States."" ""Nobody agrees with America's foreign policy,"" said Sertac Yakin, a university student from Ankara who also attended the Istanbul meeting in April. ""To change public opinion in Turkey is a long-term affair,"" argued Kemal Koprulu, the founder of Ari Movement, an Istanbul-based nongovernmental organization that focuses on promoting youth participation in civil society. ""There is no way that the election of a president and several nice statements from a State Department spokesman will change dramatically the public opinion in Turkey."" Koprulu argued that his organization has documented alarmingly high levels of anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism among young Turks. He pointed out that at a recent academic conference at one of Turkey's most progressive universities in Istanbul, he witnessed audience members give a five-minute standing ovation to a Turkish speaker who ""slammed America"" in front of a panel of visiting U.S. officials. The White House does appear to have made some progress in patching up damaged relations with the powerful Turkish military. Top Turkish army generals did not attend an important bilateral conference in the United States last year, following American criticism of Turkey's cross-border military offensive against Kurdish PKK rebels in Northern Iraq. This year, the Turkish military chief of staff was among the key speakers attending the conference. But Gen. Ilker Basbug reportedly told the audience of dignitaries in Washington this week that the ongoing presence of PKK rebels in Northern Iraq continues to have a negative impact on Turkish-U.S. relations. Many Turks say they are still waiting to see to whether the Obama White House's change in tone will translate to a change in the U.S. government's deeply unpopular foreign policy in the Middle East. They highlighted America's strong support for Israel over the Palestinians, and the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I believe [Obama] understands the importance of the Islamic world,"" said Abdurrahman Dilipak, a columnist at Vakit, Turkey's most conservative newspaper. ""We will monitor his stance. He makes promises yet we have to see how he will act. Muslims are still treated as terrorists when they arrive in the U.S."" That wait-and-see attitude was even reflected by Basaran, the enthusiastically pro-American student who helped found a Turkish-American friendship club at her university. ""Because Obama has the [Muslim] name Hussein, people really love it,"" Basaran said. ""I think he's the most favorite U.S. president among Muslim people. But we'll see."" Yesim Borg in Istanbul contributed to this report.","Poll says only 9 percent of Turks had positive view of U.S. in 2007 .

Jordanian double agent  The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officials and a Jordanian military officer last week in Afghanistan was a trusted Jordanian double agent, a former U.S. intelligence official told CNN. The man had been used by both U.S. and Jordanian intelligence services in the past, and had provided information about high-value targets, the senior U.S. official said. The security breach occurred because the bomber was met off-base by U.S. intelligence officials, who failed to search him before they put him in a car and drove him onto Forward Operating Base Chapman, the former intelligence official said. Both the Jordanian and U.S. intelligence services believed the man was loyal, according to the former intelligence official. The New York Times reports that the Pakistani Taliban identified the bomber as Humam Khalil Mohammed and that he was a Jordanian doctor.

There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Two doctors who treated Anna Nicole Smith in the months before her death and her lawyer-boyfriend go on trial Wednesday on charges they illegally conspired to provide the actress with drugs. Steven Sadow, the lead lawyer for Howard K. Stern, said the defense team was ""very pleased"" with the jury of six men and six women who were sworn in Tuesday afternoon. Opening statements were scheduled for Wednesday morning. Lawyers predicted the trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court could last up to three months. Potential jurors were asked more than 100 questions, including personal questions about their prescription drug use. Smith's boyfriend Stern, along with Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor, face 23 felony charges, including three counts of conspiracy to dispense and administer controlled substances to a known addict. The three also are accused of conspiring to use false names to obtain drugs for Smith, a practice defense attorneys have argued was intended to protect the celebrity's privacy. Smith died February 8, 2007, from what a Florida medical examiner ruled was ""acute combined drug intoxication."" Judge Robert Perry dismissed several jurors because of what he called ""language problems"" or because they expressed opinions suggesting they had already concluded guilt in the case. The judge described one juror as ""dull"" and predicted she would become a problem if allowed on the jury. Judge Perry ruled at the end of a 13-day preliminary hearing last fall that there was probable cause to try Stern and the two doctors for involvement in an alleged conspiracy to provide drugs to a known addict. ""Evidence in the record strongly suggests she was an addict,"" he said. Perry said ""there was a widespread and ongoing effort"" to obtain drugs for Smith, whom he characterized as a ""strong-willed person"" intent on getting drugs. The doctors may have been ""blinded by the celebrity of their patient,"" Perry said. A defense lawyer said the case could have a chilling effect on doctors who treat patients for pain, since the doctors could be held criminally liable if their prescriptions are deemed excessive. Witnesses described Smith as weak and ""zombie-like"" much of the time in the months after September 11, 2006, when her 20-year-old son died in the Bahamas hospital room where she was recovering from the birth of her daughter. Sadow argued that Stern should not be charged because he did not know his companion was an addict or that it was illegal to obtain medication with a prescription written out to a false name. ""He's being charged here with doctor-related activities, which doctors have specific knowledge of and he's just a layperson,"" Sadow told the judge. Prosecution witnesses outlined evidence that the doctors wrote many prescriptions using several names, including Stern's, for drugs intended for Smith. ""One of their theories is that the mere prescribing of medications using a pseudonym is a crime and it's rebutted by the fact that some of the most respected hospitals in this city use this practice to protect the privacy of some of their celebrity patients,"" Eroshevich defense lawyer Adam Braun said. Prosecutors argued that Stern used the false names to get double doses of dangerous drugs to feed the addiction of the former Playboy model and reality TV star. Kapoor's lawyer said prosecutors could make it difficult for California doctors to treat their patients for pain. ""If this prosecution is successful, you can all plan to call the D.A. office every time you ask your doctor for a prescription for pain, because that's going to be the standard,"" attorney Ellyn Garafalo said. Perry agreed with Braun's argument that Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, ""deeply cared for Anna Nicole Smith and was well intentioned"" with her treatment. ""I made that observation,"" the judge said.","Two doctors and Smith's boyfriend are charged .

Anna Nicole Smith died in 2007 of ""drug intoxication"""
"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend and two doctors entered ""not guilty"" pleas Wednesday to new charges connected to the death of the former Playboy model and reality TV star in 2007. Howard K. Stern  appeared in court on charges connected to the death of Anna Nicole Smith. Howard K. Stern, Smith's lawyer and companion, appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court, along with Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor to formally hear the charges. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, was ruled to be from ""acute combined drug intoxication,"" the Broward County, Florida medical examiner said. The three are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, while the doctors were charged with six each. They were all charged earlier this year with conspiring to give Smith drugs, but prosecutors revised the counts based on the latest findings from the investigation. The three defendants previously entered ""not guilty"" pleas to those charges. A preliminary hearing is set for next month in the case. A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2Â½-year probe was unsealed and released Tuesday. They revealed new details, including an account of one witness who told investigators she saw Stern inject Smith with drugs. A nanny hired to care for Smith's infant daughter, who was born in the Bahamas in September 2006, told investigators she witnessed Stern and Dr. Eroshevich ""crush pills, heat them to turn them into liquid and inject Smith,"" according to an affidavit from a state investigator. The nanny stated that ""after taking pills or being injected Smith would be 'like you were drinking,' often falling in the house, and sleeping for two or more days at a time,"" California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago said in a sworn statement. Doctors gave Smith numerous dangerous drugs over the three years before her death, including while she was pregnant, according to the affidavits. One investigator described Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall, as a ""drug seeker."" She ""was given drugs in excessive amounts,"" according to a medical expert consulted and quoted by a state medical board investigator. Dr. Jill Klessig also told an investigator that ""in addition to the prescribing issues, there appears to have been a personal relationship"" between Smith and the two doctors that crossed the boundaries of professionalism. Investigators found photos of Dr. Eroshevich -- a woman -- and Smith ""naked in the bathtub in intimate embraces,"" according to one sworn statement. Dr. Klessig said ""such behavior constitutes unprofessional behavior."" One affidavit references a video clip of Kapoor ""kissing and snuggling"" with Smith ""in a reclined position in a nightclub setting."" Eroshevich traveled to the Bahamas to visit Smith and was with her for four days in Hollywood, Florida, four days before her death, an investigator said in an affidavit. The doctor personally visited a Burbank, California, pharmacy in September 2006 to get chloral hydrate, a sleep aid, for Smith to use in the Bahamas. It was just four days after Smith gave birth to a daughter in Nassau. ""I wouldn't give her chloral hydrate unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer,"" pharmacist Steve Mazlin told Eroshevich, according to the affidavit. Another pharmacist said that when he refused to fill a prescription for a long list of strong narcotics, he told Dr. Eroshevich the order amounted to ""pharmaceutical suicide."" The affidavit from Jon Genens, a senior investigator with the California medical board, detailed dozens of prescriptions written for Smith -- under several aliases -- for a long list of narcotics and sleep aids. Genens said even during her pregnancy, starting in January 2006, Kapoor prescribed an average of 10 tablets of methadone per day for Smith. He noted that Kapoor lowered the dosage in the last three months of her pregnancy. The volume of dangerous drugs being ordered by doctors spurred the chief pharmacist at the store where most of the prescriptions were filled to call a drug expert for advice in late 2006, according to a sworn statement by California Department of Justice Special Agent Jennifer Doss. Dr. Greg Thompson told Doss that he recalled the dosages were ""dangerously high."" ""Dr. Thompson stated they might work for a drug addict under supervised care, or with a dying cancer patient in a hospital, or 'if you were going to kill someone,' "" Doss said. Thompson told Doss he later ""admonished Dr. Eroshevich"" about the drugs she was requesting for Smith. ""Dr. Thompson stated Dr. Eroshevich was obviously not familiar with a lot of medications she was prescribing for Anna Nicole Smith,"" Doss said in her affidavit. The Doss affidavit said the doctor used Smith's boyfriend as a cover to get the prescriptions filled. ""Of the 12 medications found in Anna Nicole Smith's hotel room at the time of her death, seven medications were prescribed in the name of Howard K Stearn (believed to be Howard K Stern) by Dr. Eroshevich,"" Doss said. The drugs were apparently personally delivered to Smith in the Bahamas and Florida by her doctor, Doss said. ""It is reasonable to believe that Dr. Eroshevich provided Anna Nicole Smith prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from California to Nassau, Bahamas with her on her travels to visit Anna Nicole Smith,"" Doss said.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich smashed seven goals past struggling Hannover to re-establish the German giants' two-point lead in the Bundesliga on Saturday night. In-form Dutch forward Arjen Robben scored a hat-trick while Croatia striker Ivica Olic and young German Thomas Muller both netted twice each to keep Bayern clear of second-placed Schalke, who earlier won 3-1 at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach. Bayern go into Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg against French side Lyon full of confidence, though the match is in doubt due to the volcanic explosion in Iceland which has halted European air travel. Robben scored the goal that put Bayern into the last four of Europe's premier club competition with an away goals win over Manchester United, and is in hot domestic scoring form after also finding the net in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. The recalled Olic opened the floodgates in the 22nd minute from close range after a cross by fullback Diego Contento, and Robben doubled the lead on the half-hour with a superb solo effort. Robben was also involved as Muller made it 3-0 just before halftime, and Olic followed up four minutes after the break when the 20-year-old midfielder's shot was only parried by goalkeeper Florian Fromlowitz. Robben struck again a minute later, while Olic's backheel teed up Muller on 62. Robben, a big hit at Bayern since signing from Real Madrid in August, wrapped up the romp in the final minute as he again tormented the visiting side, who were left second from bottom of the table. Schalke moved onto 61 points with three games to play after a routine win over 12th-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic put the hosts ahead in the eighth minute with the first of his two goals, a fierce effort from just inside the penalty area, but Raul Bobadilla waltzed past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to level on 16. Jefferson Farfan gave Schalke the lead again from close range just before halftime after striker Kevin Kuranyi's header was parried by goalkeeper Logan Bailly. Rakitic made it 3-1 soon after the break with a penalty after Mario Gavranovic was fouled by Dante, while top scorer Kuranyi had an effort ruled out in the 70th minute. Werder Bremen moved up to third place on goal difference with a 4-2 win at Wolfsburg, whose title defense has long been over. Eighth-placed Wolfsburg twice led through strikers Edin Dzeko and Grafite, but Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro made it 2-2 four minutes after halftime, and midfielder Torsten Frings put Bremen ahead with his second goal on 61. Portuguese striker Hugo Almeida wrapped it up with 15 minutes to play to end Wolfsburg's three-match winning run and leave Bremen with just one defeat in 11 outings. Bayer Leverkusen also have 54 points after losing 2-1 at Stuttgart, who climbed to sixth thanks to a double from Cacau. Leverkusen led in the 13th minute when Stefan Reinartz set up striker Stefan Kiessling for his 19th goal this season, but had Tranquillo Barnetta sent off six minutes later for a second booking. Cacau leveled just before half an hour, and the Brazilian striker -- who plans to leave Stuttgart at the end of the season -- pounced to score the winner with just five minutes left from Pavel Pogrebnyak's deflected pass. Stuttgart moved above Hamburg, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at 10th-placed Mainz following a 20th-minute winner from Aristide Bance. Hamburg have won just once in the last seven Bundesliga matches, and their hopes of European football next season may depend on winning the Europa League -- starting with Thursday's semifinal first leg at home to English club Fulham. Third-bottom Freiburg boosted their hopes of avoiding relegation with a 2-1 win over fellow strugglers Nuremberg, who also have 28 points along with 15th-placed Bochum. Bochum lost 2-0 at Cologne on Friday night as on-loan Manchester United winger Zoran Tosic scored in each half.","Dutch forward Arjen Robben scores hat-trick in Bayern Munich's 7-0 win over Hannover .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Photographer Larry Birkhead, who was proved in April to be the biological father of former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith's daughter, said Tuesday he will sue the author and publisher of a new book on Smith's death that contains allegations he called ""pure fiction."" Larry Birkhead questions the reliability of sources used in a new book about Anna Nicole Smith. ""I've instructed my attorney to sue Rita Cosby, the publisher and any source that spits out some of that false, defamatory information that's in there,"" Birkhead said Tuesday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""If I were Rita Cosby, I'd be very concerned."" Among the allegations in Cosby's ""Blond Ambition: The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith's Death,"" are that Birkhead and Howard K. Stern, Smith's attorney and companion, had an affair -- and that an intimate moment between the two was caught on videotape. ""That's totally false and it's defamatory,"" Birkhead said. ""I've heard the sources from that, and those sources are people that don't -- that haven't been in Anna's life and haven't even met me.""  Watch Birkhead describe why he plans to sue Â» . Cosby, a former MSNBC anchor, and her publisher, Grand Central Publishing, did not provide statements to CNN on the matter despite requests to do so. Birkhead said Cosby's sources on the Stern allegations were two maids, whose reliability is questionable, and Jackie Hatten, a woman who claims to be a friend of Smith's -- and who, according to the book, says she is the one who walked in on Stern and Birkhead. ""Jackie Hatten has never met me,"" Birkhead said. ""There was nothing to walk in on because, you know, nothing like that's ever happened, and there's definitely no video of it."" And by the end of her life, Smith was no longer in touch with Hatten, he said. In a statement issued to TMZ.com, Hatten said she has not read the book, but ""Rita Cosby is such a reputable reporter and person, I can only assume it is true and credible. I am happy the American public will finally know the truth."" Smith, 39, died February 8 in a Florida hotel room of an accidental drug overdose. Her death sparked a legal battle between Stern and Birkhead over the paternity and custody of her infant daughter, Dannielynn. A Bahamian court, citing DNA tests, declared Birkhead the father of Dannielynn in April. At that point, Stern, who was listed as the girl's father on the birth certificate, said he would not fight for custody. Ron Rale, a former Smith attorney and a friend of Stern's, told ""Larry King Live"" Stern would ""absolutely"" join in the suit against Cosby. Stern's attorney, Lin Wood, ""is a monster,"" Rale said, ""and this guy is going to go after Rita Cosby and the publisher."" Asked by TMZ.com about the video earlier Tuesday, Cosby said, ""I have not seen the videotape, but I will say that we have enough corroborating people who say that they have. We know people who clearly have been told there is a videotape that exists and have talked to people who have seen the videotape."" Stern and Birkhead, she said, were previously engaged in a legal struggle against each other and appeared to be enemies, but ""now they're friends ... and it begs the question why. I think the American public should be concerned about the state this little girl is in. If you read the book and they believe these guys are in cahoots and are in it for fame and money and not this little girl's interests at heart."" Birkhead said Cosby's comments are ""crazy ... she says she's never seen the video that she reports in her book that exists, and now she's backpedaling, saying, 'How else could you explain two guys that are enemies now get along?' and trying to make sense out of something that she never verified in the first place."" Birkhead told CNN Cosby never called him to verify the allegations or told him she was writing a book. Birkhead also noted that he has only temporary custody of Dannielynn and that he is still seeking permanent custody in a Bahamian court. He also angrily denied other allegations in the book.

"(CNN) -- Lyon coach Claude Puel is confident that his team can cause an upset in their European Champions League semifinal first leg against German giants Bayern Munich. The French side, appearing in the last four of the competition for the first time, are the underdogs as they take on the four-time champions in Munich on Wednesday night. But having beaten Real Madrid and French champions Bordeaux en route to the semifinal, Puel believes the club have the momentum to make it all the way to the final. Blog: Will Mourinho the master defeat Guardiola the great? ""It is fantastic for our club to be in the semi-finals,"" Puel told reporters at a press conference. ""But we said it before the (quarter-final) against Bordeaux: why should it end here? ""Bayern are confident, they had a huge win on the weekend (7-0 against Hannover), they are playing well but I still think we have what it takes to trouble them."" Puel said his players had not suffered as an effect of having to travel the 750 kilometers to Munich by road after volcanic ash led to a flying ban. ""You need to be able to adapt,"" he said. ""A bit more massage, a bit more walking and stretching. But I feel we have adapted."" Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery, who faced Lyon many times during his career in the French league, said his current club would be foolish to underestimate Puel's side. ""It will be very difficult against Lyon because they have a very good team,"" he said. ""We shouldn't allow ourselves to think about the final."" Bayern will be without captain Mark van Bommel and defender Holger Badstuber, who are both suspended after picking up yellow cards in the quarterfinal victory over Manchester United. But Ribery has shaken off a muscular problem to play, along with Dutchman Arjen Robben, who clinched the victory over United with a stunning late volley at Old Trafford and claimed a hat-trick in the rout of Hannover. ""The Germans are always dangerous in big matches and Bayern just knocked out Manchester United,"" said Puel. ""They have Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery hitting for them again. We know what to expect.""","Lyon coach Claude Puel believes his side can upset Bayern in the Champions League semifinals.

"(CNN) -- A man police believe is a member of the ''Pink Panther'' ring of thieves was transported from Spain to Japan on Saturday to face charges in a major heist at a jewelry shop, a Japanese state news agency reported. Rifat Hadziahmetovic, 42, of Montenegro, is suspected of stealing a diamond tiara worth 200 million yen ($2.3 million USD) and other jewelry from a Tokyo shop in 2007, according to the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo. Spain agreed to hand Hadziahmetovic, who was in custody for a separate robbery, over to Japan, Kyodo news agency said. The ""Pink Panther"" ring, which is believed to have about 200 members, is linked to more than 90 robberies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia since 1999, Kyodo said. Hadziahmetovic is suspected of participating in other armed robberies in Bahrain, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, according to the Associated Press. The ring is named after the 1963 movie starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. Members are believed to be mainly from countries in the Balkans, the AP said.","Suspect in jewelry store heist flown to Japan .

"(CNN) -- One of about every 12 babies born in the United States in 2008 was the offspring of unauthorized immigrants, a Pew Hispanic Center study released Wednesday concluded. According to the study, an estimated 340,000 of the 4.3 million babies born in this country that year had parents who were in the United States without legal documentation. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution stipulates that those children automatically become U.S. citizens, but some members of Congress are pushing to change that provision. That effort -- rooted in the debate over illegal immigration, particularly of people from Mexico -- has created some controversy. ""This has got a lot of attention in the past weeks,"" said Jeffrey S. Passel, the study's author. ""The idea was just to put a number on it."" According to the study, 79 percent of the 5.1 million children of unauthorized immigrants in the United States were born in this country, making them U.S. citizens. Nearly one of four children born in the United States in 2008 had parents who were immigrants, the Pew study found. Of those, 16 percent of the parents were legal immigrants and 8 percent were in the United States without proper documentation. Many of those children are Latino, Passel said. More than three-fourths of all unauthorized immigrants in the United States in March 2009 were Latinos, the researcher said. And nearly one of every four children under age 18 in the nation was a Hispanic. That trend is likely to continue, the study concludes. ""Overall, Hispanics who live in the U.S. have higher rates of fertility than do whites, blacks or Asians,"" the report states. ""And among Hispanics, the foreign born have higher rates of fertility than the native born."" Immigration reform has become a hot-button issue this political season. Arizona passed a law in April that required all immigrants to carry documentation of legal status and other states are considering similar measure even though major parts of the Arizona law were struck down last month in federal court. ""The country is really emotionally torn over this,"" U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said recently on CNN. The government estimates there are more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Proponents of stricter immigration enforcement and control point to the large number of Latinos having babies in the United States as reason to change the 14th Amendment. The proponents say these children, which they often call ""anchor babies,"" qualify for welfare and other programs and make it harder to deport their parents . ""Babies born to illegal alien mothers within U.S. borders are called anchor babies because under the 1965 immigration Act, they act as an anchor that pulls the illegal alien mother and eventually a host of other relatives into permanent U.S. residency,"" says an organization called The American Resistance, which has described itself as ""a coalition of immigration crime fighters opposing illegal and undocumented immigration."" Under the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, the child may sponsor other family members for entry into the United States when he or she reaches the age of 21. The group notes that ""the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 to protect the rights of native-born Black Americans, whose rights were being denied as recently freed slaves."" The intent of the amendment ""was clearly not to facilitate illegal aliens defying U.S. law at taxpayer expense,"" The American Resistance says on its website. Having a child become an automatic U.S. citizen can provide immigrants with another reason to come to this nation illegally, some critics say. ""I think we need to look at that in the future as to whether or not we want to change that because I think it's an incentive to break the law,"" said Graham, the U.S. senator. Texas state Rep. Debbie Riddle, a Republican, pointed out another concern on CNN's ""AC 360"" program Tuesday night. Some pregnant women from other countries are traveling to the United States to give birth and then taking their babies back home to raise them as terrorists that would return to attack America, she said. Information for that ""sinister issue,"" Riddle said, is coming from from former FBI officials she declined to name. ""This is something that is being talked about by various members of Congress,"" she said. State Rep. Rafael Anchia, a Democrat, disputed the claim, calling it ""the myth of anchor babies."" ""For that to rise to some sort of national security concern is really unsubstantiated,"" Anchia said. ""The 9/11 bombers were all here legally. The Times Square bomber was a naturalized citizen. He was not an anchor baby."" Anchia also disputed the contention that having a baby in the United States hinders the deportation process. ""The law does not bear that out,"" he said. ""Just because you have a child here doesn't mean you can't be deported tomorrow."" Despite all the heat, a majority of Americans seem to oppose changing the 14th Amendment. A nationwide poll conducted in June by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found that 56 percent of Americans are against changing the citizenship provision while 41 percent favor amending it. The Pew Hispanic Center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues.","The study was conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group .

"(CNN) -- Last week, nearly 40 billionaires announced their intention to give half their wealth to charity at the encouragement of bridge-playing buddies Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. This unprecedented action brought to mind Winston Churchill's famous line about the Lend-Lease plan as ""the most unsordid act in the whole of human history."" There has lately been dark talk of the American Dream and American exceptionalism slipping away, but I believe this billionaire compact shows both are alive and well. The majority of individuals on this self-selecting list are self-made men and women who built their fortunes in their own lifetime. Among them are New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Separately, it was announced earlier this week that the estate of the late Johnny Carson was also donating more than $150 million to a charitable foundation. It's difficult to imagine any other nation in history whose wealthiest individuals would voluntarily decide to give half their wealth to charity, not only at home, but around the world.  And whether the money goes to cure river blindness in Africa or help finance charter schools in this country, it is something that reflects well upon the United States. Those who pledge do us proud. There is another issue raised by the billionaires' compact, beyond the increasing gap between rich and poor in the United States. It is the gap between the ""super rich"" -- who really do have more money than they know what to do with -- and what might be called the ""working wealthy,"" who are taxed as though they're rich enough to able to give away half their money. These are individuals whose household income might bring them into the top tax bracket of $250,000 a year but who, with two parents working, might still find themselves struggling to stay in the stability of the upper-middle class in the expensive urban areas where they often work. Much of the anger about the scheduled sunset of the Bush tax cuts for the increase in top-bracket taxes comes from this productive group of Americans. The super rich are looking for charitable donations to deduct from their taxes each year, while the working wealthy are still trying to pay all their bills. But they are taxed at the same rate as the private jet set (what a few years ago might been called the Bernie Madoff crowd). The super-rich rule high finance or might have started a high-tech company before the bubble. In contrast, the working wealthy might include someone who owns a small business or works as a mid-level executive in a top-line traditional corporation. But they are the ones most feeling the squeeze of expectations in the Great Recession, while getting lumped in with the super rich. Let's be clear: The working wealthy aren't suffering in any objective sense, but they feel they are paying most of the taxes and getting few of the benefits. Small-business owners create almost 70 percent of the new jobs in America, and they are the ones who feel most left out of the current economic recovery. At the same time, the Metro Wealth Index shows that the number of millionaires is increasing in cities across the country. And the bankers who triggered the economic collapse got billions in bailout money and even got to keep some of their taxpayer-subsidized bonuses. The forgotten American middle class saw no real gains in income over the past decade despite the tax cuts because of rising health care and energy costs. Big business and big government seem indifferent to the struggles of small businesses, and it's got small-business owners feeling angry and alienated, like forgotten American citizens. Meanwhile, politicians slobber over the super rich for campaign donations while they pander to voters with class-warfare populism. The billionaires' compact is worth viewing with uncynical eyes. It is an historic and selfless attempt to leave the world a better place. And if the charitable contributions are directed carefully, funding innovation and fostering independence (like Andrew Carnegie's public libraries did a century ago), rather than dependence, then they can help more people to achieve their own American dreams. But the stark fact is that such largess in a time of recession also highlights the growing gaps in our society, not just between the rich and poor, but between the super rich, the working wealthy and the forgotten middle class. America remains a meritocracy with long odds and high-payouts -- and is infinitely better than any alternative.

"San Francisco, California (CNN)  -- As all people of conscience will agree, human trafficking and child exploitation are utterly despicable and horrendous crimes. In contrast with the epidemic numbers often cited for the nation as a whole, the incidence of such crimes is low and getting lower on Craigslist because of the comprehensive preventive measures we have taken. Some experts now liken the relative rarity on Craigslist to ""looking for a needle in a haystack."" Nevertheless, any misuse of our site whatsoever in facilitating such unspeakable crimes is unacceptable, and we will continue to work tirelessly, in tandem with law enforcement and key nonprofits, to ensure that any victims receive the assistance they desperately need and deserve, and that those responsible are imprisoned. We believe Craigslist is one of the few bright spots and success stories in the fight against these terrible scourges. We've been told as much by experts on the front lines of this fight, many of whom we have met with, and many of whom have shared helpful suggestions that we have incorporated in our approach. Even politicians looking to advance their careers at the expense of Craigslist's good name grudgingly admit, when pressed, that we have made huge strides, and that Craigslist is virtually alone among advertising venues in vigorously combating these problems. Indeed, to our knowledge, only Craigslist, out of countless venues, takes any of the following measures, let alone all  of them: . â¢ Educating and encouraging users to report trafficking and exploitation . â¢ Prominently featuring anti-trafficking and exploitation resources . â¢ Creating specialized search interfaces for law enforcement . â¢ Providing support for law enforcement anti-crime sweeps and stings . â¢ Actively participating in the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's cyber-tipline program . â¢ Leading all awareness efforts for the National Trafficking Hotline . â¢ Meeting regularly with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement . â¢ Manually reviewing every adult service ad before posting . â¢ Requiring phone verification for every adult service ad . â¢ Implementing the PICS content labeling system. Last year, we began manual screening of each adult services ad before its posting, and those unwilling to conform to Craigslist's standards left in droves for the many venues that do not screen ads. This migration is a matter of public record. You do not hear about arrests connected to the vast majority of adult services advertising because the venues hosting those ads do not cooperate with law enforcement, do not urge their users to be on the lookout for and report suspected trafficking and exploitation, do not participate in reporting programs, do not consult regularly with experts and advocacy groups, and in fact do not take any of the preventive measures we have taken. Looking on the bright side, the potential for progress would be enormous if all such venues would adopt the  practices that Craigslist has established. We are aware that some have called for ""shutting down"" the adult services section of Craigslist. Fortunately, most concerned parties seem to realize that declassifying adult services ads back into Craigslist personals, services, and other categories, and offsite to venues that have no interest in combating trafficking and exploitation or in assisting law enforcement, would simply undo all the progress we have made, undermine our primary mission of evolving Craigslist community sites according to user feedback, set back the efforts of our partners in law enforcement and exacerbate the very societal epidemic we all seek to end. Read an alternate view accusing Craigslist of publishing such ads . In serving our users and the general public as best we can, Craigslist has to balance an immense amount of passionate and often conflicting feedback, and at the end of the day do what our consciences tell us is right. Certainly the adult services arena has exemplified this. Passionately held opinions on the part of respected experts and well-intentioned citizens range from insistence that all aspects of the ""adult industry"" must be legalized and regulated in order to make further progress against trafficking and child exploitation, to those equally insistent that the entire industry must be further criminalized and marginalized for such progress to be made. Fortunately, there is a lot of common ground among all concerned parties, regardless of ideology, and we are focused on making further progress by continuing to seek and incorporate the collective wisdom of the many who have generously shared their ideas and advice about these complex issues. As a community site facilitating billions of human interactions among more than 50 million Americans each month, we face many of the same difficult social problems that have faced communities throughout the ages, and all the support, advice and encouragement we have received from so many is sincerely appreciated.

"(CNN) -- Brazil has formalized its offer of asylum to Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian woman convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning, Brazilian state-run media said Tuesday. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had made a previous offer for asylum, raising Ashtiani's hopes for survival. Brazil's ambassador in Tehran has now officially made the offer at Iran's foreign ministry, according to the state-run news service Agencia Brasil. Brazilian Minister of Foreign Relations Celso Amorim told reporters Tuesday that he spoke last month with his Iranian counterpart, Manouchehr Mottaki, about Ashtiani's sentence. ""I called my Iranian colleague ... to say that the action hurt the sensibility of the Brazilian people and that therefore I was making an appeal, I was asking to reconsider the hypothesis. In that moment, actually, the news we had was more about the stoning, which was based on a highly debatable crime in our view of the world."" Amorim described Ashtiani's threatened punishment as ""something that is really baffling to our culture and to the way we see the world."" On Saturday, Lula addressed the matter in Bogota, Colombia, where he said he had asked Amorim to ask the Brazilian ambassador in Tehran to talk to Iranian authorities about it. ""I can't imagine someone being stoned,"" Lula said. ""I can't imagine. That's why I made the request. If there was condition to send her to Brazil, we would receive her with arms wide open."" Lula added that he opposes the death penalty under any circumstances. ""I don't think the state has the right to kill a person,"" he said. Iran rejected a previous, informal offer, saying Lula lacked sufficient information about the case. Last month, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, who is the head of the judiciary of East Azerbaijan province, said Ashtiani's crimes were ""numerous"" and said she was ""convicted of adultery and murder and was sentenced to death,"" according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. Ashtiani's lawyers said Iranian authorities are mischaracterizing the status of the adultery and murder charges against her. Attorney Hootan Kian said that, though Ashtiani was cleared of her husband's murder five years ago, Iran continues to insist she was found guilty. Ashtiani has said she was ""grateful"" for Brazil's offer and would ""graciously"" accept, according to a statement from her son, Sajjad Ashtiani, who has visited his mother in a Tabriz prison. Ashtiani, 43, was convicted of adultery in 2006 and was originally sentenced to death by stoning. But after international pressure, Iranian authorities said the sentence has been put on hold. A decision could come any day on whether the courts will reinstate Ashtiani's sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. Mina Ahadi, spokeswoman for the International Committee against Stoning, said if Ashtiani is executed, ""it is entirely political. It has nothing to do with the case itself."" Ahadi wrote a letter to Lula last week, saying that his offer was an ""important step"" in saving Ashtiani from undue punishment. Brazil's relations with Iran have improved in recent years and it recently participated in talks with Tehran aimed at restarting negotiations about Iran's nuclear program. In May, Brazil helped broker a deal with Iran that would provide the government with enriched uranium for medical research. It also abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote on tougher sanctions for the Islamic republic. One of Ashtiani's attorneys, Mohammad Mostafaei, is seeking asylum for himself in Norway. Mostafaei's wife and brother-in-law were arrested and imprisoned in Iran but have since been released. In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was ""troubled"" by Ashtiani's case. ""The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights and intimidate and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and stand up for the rights of their fellow citizens,"" she said in a statement. Clinton also expressed concern about the fate of protesters who were arrested in anti-government demonstrations after the June 2009 elections and about Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year-old man charged with homosexuality and facing ""imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation."" She urged Tehran ""to halt these executions in accordance with its obligations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"" and called for the release of political prisoners and human-rights defenders. Journalist Luciani Gomes contributed to this story.","NEW: ""I was asking to reconsider the hypothesis,"" says Brazil's foreign minister .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer and companion for former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith has filed a $60 million libel suit against the author and publisher of a new book on Smith's life and death. Howard K. Stern, shown in February, claims the book falsely accuses him of homosexual acts and cocaine use. Howard K. Stern's suit claims the book falsely accuses him of behavior including homosexual acts, illegal possession and use of cocaine and criminal involvement in the deaths of Smith and her son, Daniel. Stern claims in the suit against Rita Cosby and her publisher, Hachette Book Group USA, that Cosby ""intentionally published false and defamatory statements about Stern related to Ms. Smith's death in a calculated effort to increase sales and increase profits"" in her book, ""Blonde Ambition: The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith's Death."" Stern's attorney, Lin Wood, told CNN the suit seeks $10 million for compensatory damages and $50 million for punitive damages. Wood said Cosby and her publisher ""made a conscious decision to smear the personal and professional reputation of my client, Howard K. Stern, by publishing vicious lies about him. Blonde Ambition is filled with false accusations about Mr. Stern unsupported by any credible or reliable sources. ""Blonde Ambition purports to be a 'tell-all' book, but it can only be accurately described as a 'tell-all-lies' book,"" Wood said in a statement. Attempts by CNN to reach Cosby, a former MSNBC anchor, and Hachette Book Group USA on Tuesday night were not immediately successful. Smith, 39, died February 8 in a Florida hotel room of an accidental drug overdose. Her death sparked a legal battle between Stern and photographer Larry Birkhead over paternity and custody of her infant daughter, Dannielynn. In addition, the two, along with Smith's estranged mother, Virgie Arthur, fought a legal battle over custody of Smith's body that delayed the former model's burial. After DNA testing, a Bahamian court declared Birkhead the father of Dannielynn in April. At that point, Stern, who was listed as the girl's father on her birth certificate, said he would not fight for custody. On CNN's ""Larry King Live"" September 4, Birkhead also denied the allegations in Cosby's book, which include that he and Stern had an affair -- and that an intimate moment between the two was caught on videotape. Birkhead said he had instructed his attorney to sue Cosby, the publisher and ""any source that spits out some of that false, defamatory information that's in there. If I were Rita Cosby, I'd be very concerned."" He also denied another claim in the book, that he and Stern were working together behind the scenes during the custody battle for Dannielynn or to make money off Smith's death. Stern claims in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, that ""defendants have exploited Ms. Smith's life and death by publishing false and defamatory accusations against Howard K. Stern, who was Ms. Smith's longtime lawyer, friend and companion."" The suit claims that Cosby and her publisher had notice that statements in the book were not true before its publication, and that they were warned not to publish those statements by Stern's attorneys. Cosby made no attempt to contact Stern to verify the allegations, the suit says. Birkhead also said that Cosby never contacted him regarding the allegations.  E-mail to a friend .","Howard K.

"(CNN) -- Want a hot tip about how to make a financial killing this year? Die. That's right. It sounds like a distasteful joke, but courtesy of the United States Congress, it's a gruesome reality. Because of a hiccup in the convoluted tax laws, Americans who have done exceptionally well for themselves during their lives will be able to preserve an enormously greater percentage of their money, and thus be able to pass it on to their heirs, if they die before midnight on December 31. The federal estate tax, for this calendar year only, is zero percent; at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve it immediately goes to a potential 55 percent for people who have managed to build up a considerable nest egg for their families. The 55 percent rate will apply to everything after the first $1 million in assets, if the current law stands. (Congress still has the beat-the-clock option to step in and change the rules for next year, but so far has not.) The details of the back-and-forth in Congress that has led to this are enough to give you a headache, and those mice-trapped-in-a-maze legislative machinations have been exhaustively reported on and analyzed. Suffice it to say that the smart people in the world of money and investments -- the ones who always seem to know when it's time to move to municipal bonds, or to roll their cash over into some exotic derivative, or to switch to real estate -- are now saying that dying this year is a sound financial strategy. As the Wall Street Journal recently put it: ""It has come to this: Congress, quite by accident, is incentivizing death."" No one is kidding about the basic facts of this. The Bernie Madoff scheme may have been unspeakably cruel, and the tricks played by the big investment banks may have been infuriating, but at least no one was telling people that they'd better die quickly if they'd like to let their families hang on to their money. The Journal ran a photo gallery of six prominent men who beat the system by dying this year: former TV host Art Linkletter, actor Dennis Hopper, Taco Bell founder Glen Bell, novelist Louis Auchincloss, real estate developer Walter Shorenstein and author J.D. Salinger. The most-talked about beneficiary -- if you can call it that, which you probably shouldn't -- of this tax weirdness is George Steinbrenner, the late owner of the New York Yankees who died last month. Under the headline ""Why Now Is a Great Time to Die,"" financial journalist Lauren Drell, who writes for AOL, calculated that by dying this year instead of next, Steinbrenner saved his relatives approximately $600 million. What do you call a system that allows such a thing to happen? ""Grisly"" is the word that tax expert Barbara Weltman used when she spoke to Drell: ""There's talk about pulling the plug on people on life support ... [It is] just horrible to think that taxes should play any role in life-and-death decisions."" But the same people who knew how to play all the angles to build an enviable financial life for themselves are now coming face to face with the ultimate angle. As attorney and estate planner Jack Nuckolls told The Associated Press: ""If you're super-wealthy, it's a good year to die. It really is."" Last year, when the estate tax was 45 percent, people in ill health faced a different kind of challenge: If they could just hold on until the first few seconds of 2010, then they could die knowing that their money had made it into the freakish one-year holiday from estate taxes. But as sadistic as that setup was -- imagine having to fight for a few more breaths because if you made it to New Year's Day, you could do a better job of providing for your children -- at least it put a premium on living. What's scheduled to happen in a little more than four months is the opposite. Those who die are the fiscal winners. There doesn't seem much to be done about it, except engage in dark wit. Eugene Sukup, 81, of Sheffield, Iowa, who founded a grain-bin manufacturing firm with $15,000 in 1963 and who has presided over it with such skill that today it provides jobs for 450 Iowans, told the Wall Street Journal that if he were to die this year he would not have to pay a penny in estate taxes. But if he were to live until the dawning moments of next year and then pass away, his bill could be $15 million. He seems to have a sense of humor about this insanity (unless he's not kidding). He said: . ""You don't know whether to commit suicide or just go on living and working."" That's what is so Alice-through-the-looking-glass about all of this, and that is why, in its nonsensical way, the tax situation is a parable for the financial madness of our times. If you've been fortunate in your life, and have accumulated a sizeable amount of money and property to leave to your children and grandchildren, and your health is starting to fail, you can hope for one more springtime with your family, and a seat in front of the television set to watch the 2011 Super Bowl, and a chance to gaze upon the fireworks and the community parade next Fourth of July. But if you do, will you feel like a sucker? Will you feel like you've wished for something foolish? Will you weigh the joy of one more year against the empty feeling of having your pocket picked by the lunacy of this particular law? ""Happy new year,"" for some people, may soon enough sound like a taunt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Tax law eliminates estate tax this year, but restores it in 2011 .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways passengers face the prospect of holiday season chaos after cabin crew voted to strike for almost two weeks over Christmas and New Year in protest over cost-cutting measures introduced by the airline. More than 12,500 BA employees, balloted by trade union Unite in November, voted by a 92.5 percent majority to walk out from December 22 for 12 days, Unite Deputy General Secretary Len McCluskey announced Monday. In a statement to customers on its Web site, BA said it was reworking its flight schedules for the strike period and would announce them as quickly as possible. It said it would inform affected customers by e-mail or text message. The strike ballot came after the airline introduced cost-cutting measures including a two-year pay freeze and reducing the numbers of cabin crew members on long-haul flights. BA says the changes, introduced in the wake of a record pre-tax loss of more than $485 million for the six months from April to September, will save the airline $665 million. McCluskey warned that the strike would inflict ""catastrophic damage"" to the airline if it went ahead and urged British Airways bosses to return to the negotiating table. He said union members had been pushed into a corner by BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh. ""We've been saying to Mr. Walsh this seems crazy at a time when British Airways is suffering badly through an economic downturn that he should force us into a dispute that would have catastrophic effects on the economy of the company,"" McCluskey told CNN following a news conference at Sandown Racecourse, southern England. ""That's why we're hoping that even at this late hour the strength of feeling of our members will get through to the company. We are available 24 hours a day to meet the company. If they are up for getting an agreement I'm confident we can get one."" McCluskey said passengers, upset at having their holiday plans disrupted, should take their anger out on the airline. McCluskey said his members were not ""mindless militants"" but decent men and women who had been forced into a corner by British Airlines. But Walsh said strike action was ""completely unjustified"" and called on union chiefs to resume negotiations. He said the airline had agreed pay cuts with pilots and more efficient ways of working with engineers, while a third of managers had taken voluntary redundancy. BA cut 1,900 jobs over the summer through reduced overtime, increased part-time working, and voluntary redundancies. But it plans to eliminate 3,000 more jobs by March 2010, Walsh said last month. ""My admiration for the professionalism and skills of British Airways cabin crew is second to none. They are an absolutely vital part of our airline, and a great asset,"" Walsh said. ""But they have been disgracefully misled by Unite as to how our company-wide cost reduction program would affect them."" CNN's Richard Quest said the impact of the potential strike would be devastating for BA and said the consequences would be disruption for BA passengers and higher prices for travelers booking on other airlines. ""Their planes are heaving and they are now about to face a strike,"" Quest said. ""They are going to have tens of thousands of passengers who are concerned, who are worried. I imagine anyone who is going away for Christmas is now thinking about shifting their booking if they can."" A spokesperson for ABTA, which represents travel agencies and tour operators in the UK, said passengers booked onto BA flights should wait and see what contingency plans the airline puts in place and whether the strike goes ahead. ""Hopefully the strike could be called off and if you cancel your flight now then you may not be able to claim a refund,"" she said. Unite has called on the High Court to rule on whether BA's cutbacks have breached its member's contracts but the case is not scheduled to be heard until February 2010.","BA cabin crew vote overwhelming for strike action over proposed cutbacks .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama last month pleaded not guilty to 10 counts including piracy, hostage-taking, and firearms charges in U.S. District Court in New York on Thursday. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse arrived in the United States on April 21. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse faces life in prison if convicted in any of eight of the 10 counts, according to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Navy took Muse into custody April 12 after the hijacking in the Indian Ocean. He arrived in the United States April 21. At his arraignment Thursday, Muse stood before Judge Loretta Preska wearing navy-blue prison garb and a bright orange undershirt. The defendant appeared dejected as he listened to the proceedings through the voice of an interpreter, looking downwards at his lap and feet most of the time. The indictment charges Muse with eight counts that each could carry a maximum sentence of life in prison: piracy, possession of a machine gun while seizing a ship by force, hostage-taking, conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, possession of a machine gun during hostage-taking, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and possession of a machine gun during kidnapping. The remaining two charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years behind bars: seizing a ship by force and conspiracy to seize a ship by force. Defense attorney Phil Weinstein asked the court for time for the defense to conduct its own investigation into the case, and the judge agreed, setting the next hearing date for September 17. Weinstein then expressed concern over Muse's treatment under incarceration, alleging that prison officials were administering medication to him without proper consent and were denying him phone calls to his family in Somalia. Weinstein also expressed concern about Muse's detention conditions. ""He's been held in administrative segregation since his arrest, which means he's detained alone for 23 out of 24 hours a day,"" Weinstein told reporters gathered outside the courthouse. ""He's unable to communicate with anyone except for us."" Muse's defense team was joined outside the courthouse by Idd Beddel Mohamed, deputy permanent representative to Somalia's mission to the United Nations in New York. He told reporters his government is monitoring the proceedings and working with the federal public defenders to ensure proper legal protection for Muse. ""We have full confidence in the U.S. legal system and we believe justice will be served,"" Mohamed told reporters.  See timeline of events that led to piracy case Â» . There had been questions about Muse's age, with his father in Somalia telling defense attorneys his son was only 15. But, a U.S. magistrate judge ruled that Muse is in fact older than 18 and can be tried as an adult. Still, the defense team continues to raise questions about Muse's exact age. They say they are working with Mohamed and other Somali officials to try to secure proper documentation of Muse's birth date. Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship, April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast, according to the criminal complaint. They boarded the ship after firing gunshots, according to crew members quoted in the complaint. Muse was carrying a gun and was the first alleged pirate on the ship, the complaint said. According to the complaint, Muse fired his gun at the Maersk's captain, Richard Phillips, and then took $30,000 from the ship's safe after he forced Phillips to open it. A Maersk crew member managed to tackle Muse and tie his hands, leading to a deal with the pirates: They would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them and if they got a life boat, the complaint said. Phillips boarded the life boat with them and the ship's crew freed Muse, who then boarded the life boat, according to the criminal complaint. Over the next three days, the life boat floated near the Maersk with the U.S. Navy's USS Bainbridge nearby. On April 12, Muse boarded the USS Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the other pirates in exchange for Phillips' release. But while he was aboard, Navy SEALs, or special forces, shot and killed the three remaining pirates and freed Phillips. The criminal complaint said Muse ""conducted himself as the leader"" of the pirates who allegedly took over the Maersk Alabama. Still, defense attorneys said they believe Muse will be exonerated in the end. ""The complaint says that [Muse] requested ... from the Americans to come aboard the Navy ship, and they granted him that permission,"" defense attorney Fiona Doherty told reporters Thursday. ""And from there, that's where he was trying to negotiate for the safe release of Captain Phillips.""","Indictment alleges eight counts that carry life sentence .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Howard K. Stern and two doctors entered ""not guilty"" pleas to charges of conspiring to provide drugs to Anna Nicole Smith before her fatal overdose in 2007. Howard K. Stern,  Anna Nicole Smith's longtime confidant, arrives at Los Angeles Criminal Courts on Wednesday. Stern -- Smith's longtime partner and attorney -- appeared before a Los Angeles judge Wednesday morning for formal arraignment, along with co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor. The three are charged in California with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007 -- only weeks before Smith's death. California Attorney General Jerry Brown, when he announced the case in March, said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed ""thousands of pills."" Smith, the former Playboy playmate and reality TV star, was drugged ""almost to the point of stupefaction,"" Brown said. Stern defense lawyer Steve Sadow has called the charges baseless and accused Brown of using Smith's death for his own political purposes. ""Bottom line is that Howard K. Stern did not commit a criminal act, period, and you can ask me that all day long and I'll still tell you he did not commit a criminal act,"" Sadow said after Wednesday's hearing. Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8, 2007, after being discovered unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood, Florida. A coroner said she died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Florida prosecutors said in March they were taking a new look at Smith's death to see if evidence California investigators had gathered recently might cause them to open an inquiry. The Broward County, Florida, state attorney's office never opened a probe into Smith's death but did assist the Seminole police department in its investigation in the days afterward.","Smith's boyfriend Howard Stern, two doctors charged with providing drugs .

"(RealSimple.com) -- My father spent his youth as a crossing guard, a Boy Scout, and a designated driver. I, on the other hand, squandered mine cutting gym class and hanging out at the mall. Back then, my father would deliver themed, Mike Brady--style lectures (one recurring favorite was the Importance of Being Honest), which I grudgingly tolerated and later dismissed. But as I've gotten older, a funny thing has come to pass: I've often found myself doing exactly what he told me to do, following even his most questionable advice -- like renting the movie ""Pink Cadillac."" Herewith, his greatest hits. (Caution: Some of these lessons may trigger flashbacks to your own father's finest moments.) RealSimple.com: Making positive changes in your life . 1. Hold hands while you hash it out. My folks have been married for 47 years. One of my father's rules for a happy marriage is that if a nasty argument erupts, hold hands as you fight. You'll feel goofy doing this, but here's the thing: It works. Recently my husband, Tom, forgot to pay a few bills that were buried under a pile of clutter. I was incandescent with rage. So we interlaced our fingers while we talked it out, and I felt my blood pressure plummet and my endorphins flow in spite of myself.

He calls a repairman only as a last resort -- and when he does, he hovers around the guy and asks tons of questions. "" Carefully observe anyone with a skill that you don't have,"" my father often said, ""and then you can take care of the fill-in-the-blank yourself."" He was right: After shadowing a handyman for an hour, I later fixed my own dishwasher, to the perpetual amazement of friends who call their super to change a lightbulb. RealSimple.com: Small, helpful gestures with big impact . 3. ...Or a uniform. It has always annoyed my dad that a waiter gets a 20 percent tip for serving a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, while a hotel maid who disposes of used dental floss often winds up with bubkes. My father routinely told our sanitation men and the crew who cleaned his office that they were doing a good job and made sure to compensate them at holidays. As a child, I used to writhe with embarrassment when he did this. Now I do the same for the sanitation workers in my neighborhood. One guy once told me, with a catch in his voice, that in 10 years, it was the first time he had ever been thanked. 4. You can never have enough baggies. Anything can be stored in a resealable plastic bag, according to my father. Shoelaces, maps, socks, meat. I used to mock his habit of bagging everything, but since then I've seen the light. They're miracle workers -- easy to stash, and you can spot their contents at a glance. RealSimple.com: Live your life on less . Now, just like Dad, I have a special drawer just for these bags, which range from giant (for sweaters) to tiny (to squirrel away nuts in my purse). When I'm missing a size in my lineup, I get tense. 5. You can't go wrong with Clint. Dad says if you are at Blockbuster and are unable to decide what to rent, get a Clint Eastwood movie. Even the bad ones, he contends, are superior to most other films. Even ""Every Which Way but Loose."" Even ""The Gauntlet"" (look it up). Now, when I'm overwhelmed by racks of DVDs, I simply look for Clint's scowling face. RealSimple.com: Keep mind and body in top condition . 6. Don't belittle the annual sack race.

""They don't mean anything to you kids now,"" he'd tell us, ""but one day you'll invest in them yourselves."" Have we ever. Every Fourth of July, we have a sack race, and I just introduced a new tradition last Christmas. After dinner, I passed out lottery tickets and coins. Soon, all you could hear was an industrious scritch-scratch. And my father was beaming. 7. For Pete's sake, stop worrying. Dad, like many guys of his generation, is a doer, not a talker. Just ""fix it,"" he tells himself, no matter how intractable the problem seems. His swift and decisive action used to strike me, a champion ditherer, as impulsive, but I've come to realize that consulting your gut leads to better decisions than exhaustive (and exhausting) deliberation. Now when I'm stymied, I say this phrase, and the answer comes. 8. Carry a hankie. Years ago, my parents and I were visiting a museum. I had a cold. My father handed me a fresh hankie and told me to keep it in my purse. And so I have. Tissues disintegrate, but not this sturdy cloth. Restroom dryer on the fritz? Handkerchief! Want to wrap a cookie to go? Handkerchief! 9. No one's smarter than you. Long ago, if I was in a group and the conversation strayed to an unfamiliar topic, I'd keep silent. Dad urged me to say, ""I don't understand. Can you explain what you're talking about?"" Asking questions makes you sound smart, he said, and confident to boot.

"(CNN) -- An autopsy was conducted Monday in the death of a onetime medical student who died of an apparent suicide while facing charges in a killing tied to the Craigslist website. However, the medical examiner is withholding the official cause of death for Philip Markoff pending further tests, prosecutors said. ""Markoff was alone in his cell and all evidence collected thus far indicates that he took his own life,"" Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis and Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said in a statement released earlier. ""Nonetheless, as with all such cases, a comprehensive investigation will be conducted to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding his death."" Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral told CNN that Markoff had not demonstrated any notable behavior while in custody and did not pose a disciplinary problem before his death. While Markoff had been on suicide watch from April 23 to May 14, he was not on watch around the time he died, she said. Suicide watch for jail inmates is determined by a psychiatrist, she said. In her eight years as sheriff, there have been four confirmed suicides; Markoff would be the fifth. There's an average of 57 serious suicide attempts a year, Cabral added. Markoff was found unresponsive in his Boston, Massachusetts, jail cell at 10:17 a.m. Sunday and pronounced dead by medics, according to officials. He was found with wounds to his neck and ankles, EMS spokeswoman Jennifer Mehigan said. Markoff, 24, was charged with the April 14, 2009, fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service, and said Markoff might have met her through the site. In a statement Sunday, the family of Brisman said it was ""shocked and dismayed"" at the news of Markoff's apparent suicide. ""Their grief for Julissa is as fresh today as the day over a year ago when Markoff took Julissa away from them,"" said the statement issued by a representative for the family. ""The long-awaited criminal prosecution was their only opportunity to confront him, and now he has taken that away as well."" The family promised to pursue ""other avenues to seek justice for Julissa and help ensure that others do not suffer from such devastating, unnecessary violence,"" according to the statement. Markoff was also charged with the April 10, 2009, robbery of Trisha Leffler at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Police reports said Leffler was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards and was held at gunpoint and bound. At his arraignment in June 2009, Markoff pleaded not guilty to the Massachusetts charges. He also was facing charges in an April 16, 2009, incident at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island. In that incident, police said, Markoff tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room, and the suspect fled after pointing his gun at the husband, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney. At the time of his April 2009 arrest, Markoff was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine and was engaged to be married. His friends and acquaintances expressed shock, describing him as a model student and the ""all-American"" guy. A woman identifying herself as Megan McAllister, his fiancee, maintained his innocence in an April 2009 e-mail sent to ABC News, saying Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given the wrong information as was the public,"" she said. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" Markoff's attorney had also proclaimed his innocence. Conley, the district attorney, told reporters last year that Brisman's death was ""a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them."" Brisman sustained blunt head trauma and was shot three times at close range, prosecutors said. Conley said they believed the motive for her death was robbery. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said. Police traced internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account that had been opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in the Boston suburb of Quincy, he said. CNN's John Branch and Logan Burruss and In Session's Beth Karas contributed to this report.","NEW: Sheriff says Philip Markoff did not behave differently before death .

"New York (CNN) -- JetBlue on Wednesday dispensed vouchers to passengers and some levity to the public, two days after one of its flight attendants famously quit following a luggage-bin altercation. Perhaps realizing that the best answer to the public support of Steven Slater might be humor, the company's blog had a posting entitled, ""Sometimes the weird news is about us."" The blog read, ""It wouldn't be fair for us to point out absurdities in other corners of the industry without acknowledging when it's about us. Well this week's news certainly falls into that category. Perhaps you heard a little story about one of our flight attendants?"" ""While we can't discuss the details of what is an ongoing investigation, plenty of others have already formed opinions on the matter. Like, the entire Internet."" The blog also praises 2,300 ""fantastic, awesome and professional Inflight Crewmembers."" The case of Slater has been a web sensation, and some consider him a folk hero. According to blogs and accounts, Slater received a small gash on his head during an altercation with a passenger. In a blaze of ""take this job and shove it,"" he reportedly used some profanity on the plane's intercom, said he was quitting, grabbed some beers and deployed the plane's chute before sliding down and running away. Meanwhile, each person on the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to New York flight Monday will receive a $100 voucher, JetBlue said. ""This is consistent with our long-standing policies,"" spokesman Steve Stampley told CNN. ""JetBlue often provides vouchers to our customers when they experience a disruption or otherwise abnormal circumstance. This event falls into that category."" Slater, who faces criminal charges in the incident, told CNN affiliate WABC Wednesday that support from the public has been ""so encouraging and so special."" ""There's some really great people out there, and I'm getting a glimpse of that,"" he said. ""It's a surprise because, obviously, I have been away for a little while."" Slater left a Bronx detention center Tuesday night. Slater had a scratch on his forehead. He said, it was ""more than likely"" he will lose his job. Slater's mother, Diane Slater, defended him in an interview with CNN affiliate KABC. ""I don't think he's going to be in trouble very long. I think he just had a very small meltdown, and I think he deserves to be able to have that meltdown if you saw the egg on his head where he got smacked,"" she said. Slater was arrested at his home after the incident at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after the flight landed. He was charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and criminal trespass, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office. The tension between Slater and the passenger apparently began in Pittsburgh, where the flight originated. A female passenger ""was struggling to shove her carry-on luggage (into the overhead bin) and she was competing with another passenger for the slot. They were shoving luggage around,"" said Slater's attorney, Howard Turman. ""He (Slater) came over to assist, she started cursing and -- based on the information -- slammed the overhead luggage bin on his (Slater's) head,"" Turman said. Turman said the female passenger said ""F--- you"" to Slater. After the flight landed at JFK, Slater approached the female passenger who was retrieving her bag from the bin while the plane was still taxiing to the gate, according to a source familiar with the incident. Passengers are required to stay in their seats with their seat belts fastened until the pilot has reached the gate and gives the all-clear sign. The passenger cursed Slater again, Turman said. Her fury grew upon learning she would have to wait at baggage claim to retrieve luggage she was forced to check at the gate. At that point, Slater got on the plane's public address system. Passenger Phil Catelinet wrote on his blog that Slater said, ""To the passenger who just called me a motherf-----: f--- you. I've been in this business 20 years, and I've had it."" When the plane stopped at the gate, Slater grabbed some beer from the beverage cart before deploying the emergency slide and leaving. JetBlue announced Tuesday that Slater has been suspended pending an investigation. The airline declined to specify whether the suspension is a paid leave of absence. Slater smiled as he entered a courtroom Tuesday for his arraignment. He was ordered held on $2,500 bond and not to have contact with two specific JetBlue employees. Turman described his client as ""a dedicated son"" who has been flying to California regularly to attend to his mother, who is suffering from Stage 4 lung cancer. The second-degree criminal mischief and the first-degree reckless endangerment charges are felonies that could land Slater in jail for seven years if convicted, authorities said. The JetBlue blog had a host of comments after the posting. ""Everyone on the web is supporting Steven, but not his company,"" one comment read. ""That's a pity ... That's a bad ad for you. Support your workers as all your customers are doing."" CNN's Richard Davis, Allan Chernoff, Julian Cummings, Susan Candiotti, Laura Batchelor and Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","JetBlue posts blog item about its flight attendant .

"(CNN) -- Satellite photographs on NASA's website show hundreds of hot spots generated by wildfires across central and western Russia. State media reported that the images showed 368 hot spots across Russia on Saturday. RIA Novosti quoted a spokeswoman for ScanEx, which analyzes the images, as saying that central Russia's Moscow, Ryazan and Nizhny Novgorod regions are the most affected. Smoke clouds, which have become a serious health hazard, can clearly been seen on the satellite images, blanketing large swaths of the country. State media reported that carbon monoxide levels in Moscow were more than six times the maximum allowable concentration, and other toxic substances permeated the city air at nine times the normal level. The disaster has killed more than 50 people and left dozens hospitalized, according to Russia's health and social development ministry. Meanwhile, Russia thanked the United States for coming to its aid. ""Russia is grateful to the United States over the assistance in tackling the wildfires raging across the country,"" said the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to news reports. The United States sent some $4.5 million in aid that included water tanks, pumps, hand tools, fire-protective clothing and medical kits, according to the U.S. State Department. RIA Novosti reported that thousands of Russian emergency workers and military personnel have been working around the clock for almost three weeks to fight the fires in 22 regions, which have so far left more than 3,500 homeless.","Satellite images on NASA website show wildfire hot spots across Russia .

"(CNN) -- Abbey Lincoln, a jazz singer, songwriter, actor and activist, died on Saturday at age 80 in New York City, a friend of hers told CNN. Carol Friedman, who has been working on a documentary about the singer for some 20 years, said Lincoln died of natural causes Saturday morning in Manhattan. She declined to provide further details. Lincoln started performing in the 1950s when she released her first album, ""Abbey Lincoln's Affair ... A Story of a Girl in Love."" Often said to have been heavily influenced by the legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday, Lincoln continued to write and perform for six decades. She was also well-known as an actress. She co-starred with Sidney Poitier in the 1968 film, ""For Love of Ivy,"" for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. During the 1960s, Lincoln became active in the civil rights movement. She sang on the album, ""We Insist! -- Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite."" She was married to the jazz musician Max Roach during the 1960s. They divorced in 1970. Speaking to National Public Radio before her death, Lincoln reflected on her life and art. ""You know, when everything is finished in a world, the people go to look for what the artists leave,"" she said. ""It's the only thing that we have really in this world -- is an ability to express ourselves and say I was here,"" she said.","Lincoln was a prominent civil rights activist during the 1960s .

"New York (CNN) -- A Pentagon estimate that Afghanistan is home to nearly a trillion dollars in sought-after minerals is good news, but it provides no assurance that the nation is on its way to peace and productivity, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. Zakaria told CNN he is skeptical of the idea that you could ""divide $1 trillion by the population of Afghanistan to reach the conclusion that every Afghan will be rich ... the history of natural resources and mineral wealth is that it produces enormous corruption and mismanagement, and very often the money does not go down to the average person."" U.S. geologists reported Monday that Afghanistan has large supplies of iron, copper and gold, along with other valuable minerals but cautioned that quick riches were not in store. ""Turning the potential of Afghanistan's mineral wealth into actual revenue will take years,"" said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. Zakaria said, ""It can be made more effective. Australia has lots of natural resources, Canada has lots of natural resources, but you really have to create an honest and efficient government, which gets us back to the central problem in Afghanistan."" The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: The New York Times reported this week that Pentagon geologists had discovered what amounts to a potential  trillion-dollar lode of minerals in Afghanistan? What's the significance of that finding? Fareed Zakaria: Well I think it's great work on the part of the Pentagon. I know the assistant secretary of Defense, Paul Brinkley, has been working on this. He's done some amazing work in Iraq in getting their economy started. I think that it's very important to find some viable economic model for Afghanistan. I have to say, however, that finding the minerals is the easy part. Creating a real economy that distributes the wealth that this produces in an effective and efficient and honest way is the much, much larger challenge. Think about the countries around the world that have great mineral wealth -- Nigeria, Russia, Zimbabwe. These are not places where the average person is doing well. Nigeria is the sixth-largest oil exporter in the world and its per capita GDP [Gross Domestic Product] is abysmal. CNN: The government in the hands of Hamid Karzai has been criticized for not being transparent and for not tackling corruption. Has there been any progress on that? Zakaria: I think there has been some progress. Karzai has been willing to speak out and act in ways that he hasn't before. His attorney general has brought charges and prosecuted people. Clearly not enough -- the government is riddled with corruption at every level -- but there is some movement. But I would say the first great challenge that Karzai faces is to make his government seem legitimate in the eyes of the people. And some part of that is about the government not being seen as corrupt, but some part of it is also about him creating a broad-based coalition -- and that means making sure that he's not excluding from government, from patronage, from local councils, those people who have credibility and political support in their areas. The key to this government's success or failure is if the Pashtun community -- which makes up 50 percent of Afghanistan and 100 percent of the insurgency -- sees the government of Hamid Karzai as their government as opposed to an alien force. That's where the bulk of the work has to take place. For more on the region, read the ""Afghanistan Crossroads"" blog . CNN: It's been reported that Karzai doesn't believe that the war against the Taliban can be won on the battlefield? Zakaria: I think that's a fair statement, and I think he's right. If the Taliban is to some extent an expression of Pashtun resistance to this government ... this is not an alien force coming from outside that you can defeat and they will go home to Saudi Arabia or wherever it is. Most of them, the vast majority, are Afghans, so you're going to have to live with them. And that means while of course you have to defeat militarily the most radical, the most intransigent elements of the Taliban, you also have to make deals to include some of them, particularly in mid- and low levels in some kind of new consensual framework. So if what Karzai means is you're going to have to share power with some Pashtuns who have been identified with the Taliban, I think he's absolutely right. If you look at the end of civil wars, they almost always end in some form of negotiation. There's very rarely complete annihilation or outright defeat of the opponent. Unlike wars between two states, in a civil war the people you're fighting are people you're going to have to live with the next day. The United States should not be allergic to the idea of political solutions to Afghanistan, because that is the only viable way we are going to get peace and stability. CNN: Is it your sense that there is conflict on this issue between Karzai and the U.S.? Zakaria: Well the United States was opposed for a long time to the idea of any kind of deal making with the Taliban. Through most of the Bush administration, the was regarded as completely impermissible. ... I think there has been a change in recent months, and it should be encouraged. CNN: So you think the Obama administration is not wary of making concessions to the Taliban? Zakaria: Well, it doesn't seem to have same allergy to negotiations, but they're not moving wholeheartedly on that front. For example, the crucial issue for many members of the Taliban is that they be taken off the U.N. blacklist, where they're described as terrorists. Their view is that this is a national resistance movement. They're not al Qaeda, and they were never part of al Qaeda, and we have been very reluctant to take them off the blacklist.  We should be looking at that list very carefully, trying to figure out if there are people there we do want to try to negotiate with. If you do want to negotiate with them, one great prize you can offer them is to take them off the U.N. list. So we've got to remember that there are real concerns that these people have about their own physical safety and security that need to be addressed. If we want to see them take some significant moves, we will have to take some significant moves as well and taking them off the U.N. blacklist is probably the most important. CNN: Is that the major obstacle to political stability in Afghanistan right now? Zakaria: The ultimate obstacle to stability is that Pakistan remains a safe haven for some of the most violent and extremist groups in Afghanistan, including the Afghan Taliban and other terrorist organizations. ... What is worrying is the fact that there is renewed activity from these groups, and the working together of various terrorist groups. There are new reports that Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is the Pakistani terrorist organization that has operated mainly against India and was implicated in the Mumbai terror attacks, is now operating against Afghanistan and is responsible for some of the terrorist attacks there. ... There's a report out from the London School of Economics this week that finds that there continue to be strong ties between the Pakistani military and these terrorist groups. That problem of the Pakistani connection remains at the heart of the Afghan situation. It's very difficult to see how you can have a stable Afghanistan when you have safe havens in the neighboring country and the possible complicity of the military in that country. The Pakistani military still believes at some level that maintaining ties to these militants is what gives them leverage in Afghanistan. CNN: As you say, the Taliban would argue that they shouldn't be on the U.N. blacklist because they're a national resistance movement, but are they sheltering al Qaeda? Zakaria: Those elements that are sheltering al Qaeda should not be taken off the blacklist. But all the evidence I've seen suggests that what remains of al Qaeda is entirely in Pakistan at this point and is being sheltered by groups in Pakistan, not in Afghanistan. ... There's a lot of the insurgency that's a local Afghan insurgency. Those are the people we should be trying to get to switch sides, not the ones who have deep connections with the radical groups in Pakistan or certainly not with al Qaeda. The key to the victory in Iraq was that you won over people in the middle, and you isolated the very extreme parts of the insurgency. We should making somewhat similar efforts in Afghanistan.","Pentagon estimates Afghanistan has nearly a trillion dollars worth of minerals .

"(CNN) -- A onetime medical student who was facing charges including first-degree murder in a killing tied to the Craigslist website died Sunday of an apparent suicide, police said. Philip Markoff was found unresponsive in his Boston, Massachusetts, jail cell at 10:17 a.m. Sunday and pronounced dead by medics, according to officials. The cause of death is under investigation, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis and Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said in a statement. ""Markoff was alone in his cell and all evidence collected thus far indicates that he took his own life,"" the statement said.  ""Nonetheless, as with all such cases, a comprehensive investigation will be conducted to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding his death."" An autopsy is scheduled to be conducted Monday, according to Jake Wark, a spokesman for Conley. Markoff, 24, was charged with the April 14, 2009, fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craiglist, a popular online classifieds service, and said Markoff may have met her through the site. In a statement Sunday, the family of Brisman said it was ""shocked and dismayed"" at the news of Markoff's apparent suicide. ""Their grief for Jullissa is as fresh today as the day over a year ago when Markoff took Julissa away from them,"" said the statement issued by a representative for the family. ""The long-awaited criminal prosecution was their only opportunity to confront him, and now he has taken that away as well."" The family promised to pursue ""other avenues to seek justice for Julissa and help ensure that others do not suffer from such devastating, unnecessary violence,"" according to the statement. Markoff was also charged with the April 10, 2009, robbery of Trisha Leffler at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Police reports said Leffler was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards and was held at gunpoint and bound. At his arraignment in June 2009, Markoff pleaded not guilty to the Massachusetts charges. He also was facing charges in an April 16, 2009, incident at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island. In that incident, police said Markoff tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room, and the suspect fled after pointing his gun at the husband, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney. At the time of his April 2009 arrest, Markoff was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine and was engaged to be married. His friends and acquaintances expressed shock, describing him as a model student and the ""all-American"" guy. A woman identifying herself as Megan McAllister, his fiancee, maintained his innocence in an April 2009 e-mail sent to ABC News, saying Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given the wrong information as was the public,"" she said. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" Markoff's attorney had also proclaimed his innocence. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters last year that Brisman's death was ""a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them."" Brisman sustained blunt head trauma, and was shot three times at close range, prosecutors said. Conley said they believe the motive for her death was robbery. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was killed showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who had sought public assistance in identifying the man. Police traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account that had been opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in the Boston suburb of Quincy, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and ""the case just begins to build from there.""

"(WIRED) -- Say hello to your latest personal navigation device: a netbook. Dell plans to introduce a GPS and Wi-Fi card that can be integrated into the company's netbooks to turn them into gizmos that can offer turn-by-turn direction as well as any Garmin or TomTom. Dell will introduce a GPS and Wi-Fi card that can be added to its netbooks to offer turn-by-turn direction. ""Smartphones already have GPS capabilities,"" says Alan Sicher, senior wireless product manager at Dell. ""We are now bringing it to netbooks so the devices know where you are and can help you where you want to go."" Customers will have the option to buy the $69 card called the Wireless 700 when ordering their Dell Mini 10 netbook. Dell's move comes at a time when navigation devices makers are looking beyond the traditional standalone GPS gadget and are offering their software on other devices. Last month, TomTom announced that its turn-by-turn directions app would be available on the iPhone. TomTom will also offer accessories such as a car mounting dock and power charger. Meanwhile, Dell is hoping to capitalize on the explosive sales of netbooks. Dell netbooks with the integrated GPS cards will allow consumers to pop open a netbook and get directions and also also make their netbook location aware. For instance, buyers can geo-tag photos on Flickr or check weather information customized to their current location. The Wireless 700 card combines Broadcom's GPS technology and Skyhook Wireless' Wi-Fi positioning solutions. As for the navigation software, it offers 2D and 3D map views, save addresses for a trip and route optimization-- pretty much all the things that a standard GPS devices does. Netbooks are petite devices. Still, it is difficult to imagine consumers carrying it around as a GPS navigation device or using it their car to find their way around--especially when smaller-sized cellphones could do the job. Sicher says Dell's GPS-capable netbooks will come in handy for international travelers. ""If you are traveling to Europe roaming costs can be pretty pricey for your cellphone,"" he says. The GPS netbooks could also be handy in areas where cellphone coverage is weak, says Sicher. But there's fine print to the turn-by-turn directions navigation software on the netbook. Though it will be free for buyers of the card and the netbook, the maps will be updated yearly and customers could be charged for the updates. Dell plans to offer accessories such as car charger and a dock for the netbooks, but they won't be available until later this month. The GPS cards will be available starting July 7.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Marilyn Monroe's sultry rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" sung for President John F. Kennedy's 45th birthday celebration marked the actress' last major public appearance before her mysterious death in August 1962. Tuesday, which would have been Monroe's 84th birthday, marked the public debut of a rare image of Monroe with Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy together after the May 19, 1962, party. The black-and-white photo, taken by White House photographer Cecil Stoughton, showed Monroe still wearing the infamously tight-fighting, sheer rhinestone-studded dress she wore when singing earlier at Madison Square Garden. President Kennedy appears to be turning away from the camera, something he rarely did, while his brother, the U.S. attorney general, looks toward them. ""There is no other known photo of Bobby [Kennedy] with Marilyn or JFK with Marilyn, and it's not because they were never photographed together,"" said filmmaker Keya Morgan, who now owns the only original prints of it. ""In fact, they were photographed together many times, but the Secret Service and the FBI confiscated every single photograph."" Stoughton, who sold the prints to Morgan a year before his death in 2008, told him agents missed one negative in their search, he said. ""The Secret Service came in when he was developing the negatives and basically confiscated all the ones of Jack, Bobby with Marilyn,"" Morgan said. ""The only one that survived is the one that was in the dryer."" Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who was an aide to President Kennedy, appears in the photo holding a drink and cigar and wearing a broad smile. Schlesinger's personal journal, published in 2007, included his impression of Monroe at the private gathering. ""The image of this exquisite, beguiling and desperate girl will always stay with me,"" Schlesinger wrote. ""I do not think I have seen anyone so beautiful; I was enchanted by her manner and her wit, at once so masked, so ingenuous and so penetrating."" He wrote that Robert Kennedy was paying great attention to Monroe at the gathering, which was at the Manhattan home of Arthur and Matilda Krim. ""Bobby and I engaged in mock competition for her; she was most agreeable to him and pleasant to me, but one never felt her to be wholly engaged,"" Schlesinger wrote in a passage included in his book ""Journals: 1952-2000."" While the relationship between the Kennedy brothers and Monroe has become a documented part of history, photographer Stoughton was reluctant to allow the image to become public until after former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy's death in 1994. Morgan said he bought access to the negative while working on an upcoming documentary about the actress's death, ""Marilyn Monroe: Murder on Fifth Helena Drive."" Stoughton, in interviews for the film, told Morgan the story behind the first lady's refusal to attend her husband's birthday gala. ""He's the one who told Jackie that Marilyn was going to be at the celebration, and her exact words were 'Screw Jack,' and she left the room and she did not go to the famous celebration,"" Morgan said. Morgan's prints show details not clear in low-resolution, cropped copies that made their way onto the internet after the photo was licensed for a book about Monroe in 2004. Singer Harry Belafonte is seen in the background with his wife, talking to a man that Stoughton told Morgan was comedian Jack Benny. Beverly Hills art appraiser David W. Streets, who reviewed the prints and their history for CNN, called them ""the real McCoy."" ""This is a very significant piece of American and celebrity history, of fine art photography,"" Streets said. Since Stoughton was a U.S. Army captain and was using a government-owned camera and film, the images themselves are in the public domain. But access to the negative, which Stoughton secretly kept, was valuable, Streets said. Stoughton made and signed 10 prints for Morgan, 30 inches by 30 inches. Nine of them go on sale Tuesday at the Art & Artifact Gallery in West Hollywood, California. The 10th print was given to singer Michael Jackson two years ago, Morgan said. Morgan was a friend of the pop star's, who was a big Monroe fan.","Rare photo taken after Marilyn Monroe sang for JFK's birthday .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama threw his support behind a controversial proposal to build an Islamic center and mosque near New York's ground zero, saying Friday that ""Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country."" ""That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances,"" Obama said at a White House Iftar dinner celebrating the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The president's remarks drew praise from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who announced his support for the Islamic center last week. Bloomberg compared Obama's speech to a letter President George Washington wrote in support of a Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode Island. ""President Obama's words tonight evoked President Washington's own august reminder that 'all possess alike liberty,' "" Bloomberg said in a statement. ""I applaud President Obama's clarion defense of the freedom of religion tonight,"" he said. To learn more about the ""ground zero"" mosque, see CNN's Belief Blog . Critics of the proposed Islamic center quickly denounced Obama's remarks. ""President Obama is wrong,"" said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.). ""It is insensitive and uncaring for the Muslim community to build a mosque in the shadow of Ground Zero. Unfortunately, the President caved into political correctness."" ""While the Muslim community has the right to build the mosque, they are abusing that right by needlessly offending so many people who have suffered so much,"" King said in a statement. ""The right and moral thing for President Obama to have done was to urge Muslim leaders to respect the families of those who died and move their mosque away from Ground Zero."" What do you think about this issue? Tell us on video . Obama, who said he was speaking both as a citizen and as president, invoked the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which critics of the Islamic center cite as the main reason for preventing its construction. ""We must all recognize and respect the sensitivities surrounding the development of lower Manhattan,"" Obama said, according to his prepared remarks. ""The 9/11 attacks were a deeply traumatic event for our country."" ""The pain and suffering experienced by those who lost loved ones is unimaginable,"" he continued. ""So I understand the emotions that this issue engenders. Ground zero is, indeed, hallowed ground."" But Obama said one ""reason that we will win this fight"" against terrorism is ""our capacity to show not merely tolerance, but respect to those who are different from us -- a way of life that stands in stark contrast to the nihilism of those who attacked us on that September morning, and who continue to plot against us today."" Repeatedly invoking the nation's founders and examples of religious tolerance from American history, the president argued that national ideals and the Constitution demanded that the project proceed. He noted that Thomas Jefferson hosted the the first Iftar dinner at the White House more than 200 years ago and said that the country had previously seen ""controversies about the construction of synagogues or Catholic churches."" ""But time and again,"" he said, ""the American people have demonstrated that we can work through these issues."" ""This is America, and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable,"" Obama said. ""The principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country, and will not be treated differently by their government, is essential to who we are. The writ of our Founders must endure."" The proposed Islamic center has provoked vocal opposition from some families of 9/11 victims and other groups. Nearly 70 percent of Americans oppose the plan, according to CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll released Wednesday. ""Obama came out for the Islamic supremacist mosque at the hallowed ground of 911 attack,"" Pamela Geller, a leading foe of the Islamic center, wrote on her blog Friday night. ""He has, in effect, sided with the Islamic jihadists."" Muslim Americans, meanwhile, applauded the speech. ""It was pitch perfect and it was cut and dry,"" said Eboo Patel, executive director of the Interfaith Youth Core and a Muslim adviser to the White House on faith issues. ""He said that our Founding Fathers built a nation on religious freedom where people from different faiths can pray and thrive and that is that."" Some Muslims said they were surprised to hear the president weigh in on the controversy. ""It's such a hot potato and he's already got so much on his plate and people jumping on him for any hint of an Islamic connection,"" said Akbar Ahmed, an American University professor who attended Friday's White House dinner. ""But he plunged in and took a very bold position."" The Islamic center's leaders say they plan to build the $100 million, 13-story facility called Cordoba House three blocks from the site of the 9/11 attacks. The developer, Sharif El-Gamal, describes the project as an ""Islamic community center"" that will include a 500-seat performing arts center, a lecture hall, a swimming pool, a gym, a culinary school, a restaurant and a prayer space for Muslims. On Wednesday, the project's developers declined an offer by New York Gov. David Paterson to relocate the project to a state-owned site. Earlier this month, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously denied landmark status for the building where the proposed Islamic center would stand, allowing the project to move forward.","NEW: Republican congressman says Obama ""caved into political correctness.""

CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A new beginning, but some things stay the same: 10 minutes, no commercials, the top news of the day, and me! I'm Carl Azuz. You're tuned in to CNN Student News. Let's get started! First Up: Islamic Center Near Ground Zero . AZUZ: Controversy leads off today's show. It's about an Islamic center that includes a mosque, an Islamic place of worship, and about where it might be built: a few blocks away from Ground Zero, the spot in New York that was attacked on 9/11. Some people argue that it is insensitive to build a mosque so close to Ground Zero. In a recent CNN poll, nearly 70 percent of Americans were against this plan. Others say having the Islamic center there could help promote understanding. Last week, President Obama weighed in. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Muslims have the right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country. That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan. AZUZ: Okay, now some people took that statement to mean that the president is in favor of the Ground Zero mosque. A day later, he claimed he was talking about a larger issue. OBAMA: I was not commenting, and I will not comment, on the wisdom of making a decision to put a mosque there. I was commenting very specifically on the right that people have that dates back to our founding. AZUZ: President Obama is taking some heat for how he's handled this situation and for what he's said. REP. PETER KING, (R) NEW YORK: If the president was going to get into this, he should have been much more clear, much more precise. And you can't be changing your position from day to day on an issue which does go to our Constitution, and it also goes to extreme sensitivity. So, that's where I am critical of the president, for not being clear. AZUZ: Putting aside the political reaction, there's a personal reaction to the proposed mosque. Listen to what a couple New Yorkers had to say about it. WOMAN ON THE STREET: I think it's terrible. It doesn't have anything to do with freedom of religion. It's making a point. There's plenty of realty all over Manhattan. There's plenty of realty everywhere. It shouldn't be here. MAN ON THE STREET: I'm glad he interjected because the Muslims have the right to prayer. It's Ramadan. We have synagogues, we have churches everywhere. I'm proud of him; I'm proud of the United States. Blog Promo .

The U.S. is the biggest. As far as the second largest goes, though... Second Largest Economy? AZUZ: And that's where things get a little tricky. See, Japan has been the world's second largest economy, but China is catching up. According to a new report, over the last quarter -- the last three months -- China passed Japan. That doesn't necessarily mean China has taken over the number 2 spot. We have to wait until the end of the year to find out about that. But as Emily Chang explains, it might be a foregone conclusion. (BEGIN VIDEO) EMILY CHANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT, BEIJING: According to these new numbers, Japan's economic output in the second quarter fell slightly short of China's. Now, for a long time, it has not been a question of if, but when China's economy would overtake Japan's as the second largest economy in the world. But, and this is a big but, if you look at the numbers for the first half of this year so far, Japan's economy is still bigger than China's. So, analysts are saying we have to wait until after the end of this year, until we get the final numbers for 2010, before we can make a judgment on this. There are a lot of factors at play here. In Japan, the economy is obviously slowing down, stimulus efforts are slowing down, exports are down and domestic demand is flat. The yen is also at a 15-year high against the dollar, so that makes Japanese exports more expensive for overseas customers. But here in China, the economy is also showing signs of slowing down. GDP growth in the first quarter fell from 11.9 percent to 10.3 percent in the second quarter, and stimulus efforts here are also on the verge of slowing down. And if indeed China does revalue its currency soon, that would make Chinese exports more expensive for overseas customers. So analysts, while most of them seem to agree that China will overtake Japan as the second largest economy in the world some time this year, we do have to wait for those annual numbers for 2010 to come out. Emily Chang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO) So What? AZUZ: Okay, China's economy is getting bigger. So what? Well, experts figure this stuff out by looking at the value of everything that a country makes. If your economy's growing, that means you're making and selling more products. So, China's making a lot of stuff. And the U.S. -- remember, the U.S. has the largest economy -- it's making a lot, too. And that could mean competition between the U.S. and China to sell all the products that they make. It could also mean opportunities for the countries to do more business with each other. Sound Check . (SOUNDS OF MILITARY EXERCISES) Military Exercises . AZUZ: That military drill lasts for 11 days. It happens every year; the U.S. and South Korea work together to make sure they're prepared to defend South Korea, as the U.S. and that country are allies. South Korea's president says the military exercises are specifically designed to prepare against any threat from North Korea. We mentioned yesterday there's been a lot of tension between these two countries. North Korea offered its own response to the military drills. It threatened to ""deal a merciless counterblow to the U.S. imperialists"" and to South Korean ""traitors."" Kids Sleeping . AZUZ: Well, I know a lot of you are dragging right now; that switchover from sleeping late in summer to school hours can be a beast. Would it make any difference to you if the school bell rang a half-hour later? I'm working on a report about that, looking for your input! Tell us when you think the bell should ring. Tell us on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com! Football Heat . AZUZ: So, we have established that school is back; so is football! Some of you players have probably been hitting the practice field for a while now. No matter what team you're on, this time of year, most everyone's facing a common opponent: the heat. Reynolds Wolf shows us how a major college program beats the heat. (BEGIN VIDEO) REYNOLDS WOLF, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: Each season, the Texas Longhorns face bitter rivals like the Sooners or Aggies. But an even tougher foe is the intense Texas heat. SHERROD HARRIS, QUARTERBACK, UNIV. OF TEXAS: I don't think I've ever gotten used to this heat. The best way I've been able to adjust to it is drink more Gatorades or waters. WOLF: Hydration: it is one method UT trainer Kenny Boyd stresses. But he also employs high-tech methods. KENNY BOYD, UNIV. OF TEXAS: Try 100.23. WOLF: Kenny will pull a player from the field when their body temperature reaches 103. BOYD: That's when you can start to exhibit some of the more significant signs or symptoms of someone in heat stress. When they get to 104, that's when we pull them from practice or the workout. WOLF: This is me after 20 minutes of light workout in the 105 degree heat. Longhorns, like most players in training, will undergo intense workouts in 45-minute intervals. While doing so, Kenny looks for danger signs. BOYD: Disorientation, any kind of decreased mental acuity, someone that's beginning to labor a lot more in their drill. How about we go cool off? WOLF: That sounds great. Wow. One method is this shirt, fitted with a stem that allows a blast of cool air to fill its chambers. Not quite as high tech, but more effective, is this, the rapid cooling tub. Whoa! May be crude, but it works. And that's the mission of trainers like Boyd to keep their players safe. BOYD: A lot of us in athletic training have been witness, or been a part, or know people that have had to deal with someone that's suffered from heat stroke or from a heat crisis. And that has really shaped some of the passion and some of the concerns that we have as a staff today at the University of Texas. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Finally today, when you hear about a police chase involving someone in black and white stripes, this probably isn't what you had in mind. The zebras didn't escape from the zoo. They were actually somebody's pets! They got scared by a dog, jumped the fence and took off, and scared local residents and led local authorities on a wild zebra chase around the neighborhood. When they were eventually caught, we can only assume how embarrassed the animals were by the whole incident. Goodbye . AZUZ: It probably left them black and white and red all over.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic were billed as a tennis ""Dream Team"" but they ended up suffering a nightmare. The top two players in the world rankings, forming a doubles pair for the first time, slumped to defeat in the first round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto. Nadal, the Spanish world number one, and Djokovic, the number two from Serbia, were beaten 5-7, 6-3, 10-8 by Canadian wildcards Vasek Pospisil and Milos Raonic. It was the first time in 34 years that the top two players in the men's world rankings have joined forces in doubles. In 1976, American duo Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe reached a quarterfinal and a final in their two outings together. But Nadal and Djokovic were less successful on their debut. After losing the first set to their more illustrious opponents, Pospisil and Raonic squared the match by winning the last three games of the second. They raced into a 4-0 lead in the Match Tie-Break and eventually won it 10-8 after Nadal and Djokovic had saved three match points. The defeat highlights the different skills required for success in doubles and singles. The Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, are a rare example of two top singles players who have enjoyed grand slam success as a doubles pair. Nadal and Djokovic will now turn their attention to the singles competition in Toronto as they step up their preparations for the U.S. Open, the fourth and final grand slam of the year, at the end of August.","Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal lose to Canadian wildcards on doubles debut .

"(CNN)  -- Talking trash has taken on a whole new meaning in Gary, Indiana -- where residents have taken their trash and their talk to the steps of City Council. Gary, Indiana, has not had garbage collection since July 12. Pick-up is set to resume Wednesday. Residents in Gary have not had trash pick-up since July 12, when Mayor Rudy Clay ordered garbage collections halted as part of an ongoing dispute between City Council and his attempts to outsource the job to sanitation giant Allied Waste. But the issue was solved Tuesday night when the council voted to continue their contract with Allied. Garbage that had piled up for nine days will be picked up Wednesday. ""The people will be happy when this garbage is picked up,"" the mayor said Tuesday night. ""We don't deserve to have all this garbage on the streets. The saga came to a head on Monday morning when dozens of protesters, with full trash bags in hand, arrived at city hall to criticize the mayor. The group, Miller Citizens Corporation of Gary, is angry about a $12-a-month trash tax, a $5 million no-bid contract with Allied, and dozens of laid-off city garbage workers. The group filed suit against the city last November on two counts: it claimed the contract with Allied was not submitted for public bids, and the trash fee may not be levied without City Council approval. In February, Judge Thomas Webber of Lake County -- where Gary is located -- ruled the Allied contract null and void, and mandated the city to stop collecting the tax until it was approved by the council. However, Allied continued to be paid monthly. The City Council voted against the trash tax on July 7. The mayor then ordered Allied to stop collecting garbage, saying the city couldn't afford to pay the company. Defending his $5 million contract with Allied on the steps of city hall Monday morning, the mayor said, ""The old system cost the tax payers $9 million a year and received 40 to 50 complaints a day."" He also said that maintenance costs were costing the city $600,000 a year. As Mayor Clay spoke, in front of the bags of trash, a scrolling sign on the City Hall property flashed ""Keep Gary Clean. Let's Pick It UP!"" CNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","Residents in Gary, Indiana, have not had trash pick-up since July 12 .

Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda (VBS.TV) -- Uganda has crept back into our consciousness lately with synchronized bomb attacks that took the lives of 76 people in the nation's capital Kampala during the World Cup festivities. When we were last in Kampala, we set out to learn more about the desperate fight for the survival of mountain gorillas. With a dwindling population of 700, they have been victims of poaching, disease, war, civil unrest, slaughter and displacement. Under pressure from rebel factions in Uganda and the DRC who massacred gorillas because the conservationists were ""getting on their nerves,"" our guide tracks the remaining apes -- by armpit stench and dung -- to keep tabs on their health. We traveled to the remote jungle area known as Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in the southwestern part of Uganda, bordering with Rwanda and the DRC, areas plagued with dictatorships, genocide and decades of civil and national wars. Ten years earlier, eight park visitors had been abducted and then murdered by a group of Rwandan armed rebels in an effort to destabilize the region. The drive from Kampala was harrowing. Our driver sped and swerved obsessively, overtaking anyone in his path despite on-coming traffic. We witnessed three traffic accidents, two fatalities and an adventurous couple having sex in the middle of a dark mountain road after midnight. With four guards armed with machetes and rifles, two advance gorilla trackers, and our guide Levi we ventured into the dense tropical rainforest that is home to roughly half of the 700 remaining mountain gorillas in the world. Here we encountered the gentle beasts and found out more about their plight. See more of this story at VBS.TV .","Mountain gorillas victims of poaching, disease, war, slaughter, displacement .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Take a soccer-crazy crowd and a traditional Palestinian opening ceremony. Add a splash of corporate sponsorship, and sprinkle in some black-clad, gun-toting security. What you're left with is the World Cup of soccer -- Gaza style. The 16-team, two-week tournament culminated Saturday with the field narrowed down to France and Jordan. The idea for the contest was the brainchild of American aid worker Patrick McGrann and a Palestinian colleague. ""There were a lot of us who were offended that Gaza is not allowed to participate with the rest of the world -- whether it's diplomacy, whether it's schooling, whether it's education or whether it's sports,"" McGrann said. ""So we chose to try and come up with something special. And in this case, a Gaza World Cup. If the rest of the world gets a World Cup, we thought Gaza should get one too."" While the teams wore the colors of France and Jordan, almost all of the players were Palestinian. Foreign nationals working for the United Nations and other aid organizations rounded out the teams to give it its international flavor. American player Corey Pattison played for the French team. He said they found a way to work past the language barrier. ""When I get out there, it's more like, 'Corey, go forward, go forward, go forward. Don't kick the ball out of bounds,'"" he said. A crowd of several thousand men, along with a few women, watched the two teams battle in a game played down to the proverbial wire. After scoring a goal a piece, the match went into overtime -- with the French besting the Jordanians on penalty shots. The crowd, as expected, went wild. And the jubilation of the players could not be contained. One jumped up on the rail separating the field from the spectators, took off his jersey and led the crowd in a raucous chant. While organizers had hoped to keep politics out of the cup, the politicians could not stay away. Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh presided over the award ceremony. But this was a day for Gazans to put aside politics and their many problems, at least for a while, and bask in the glory of hosting -- and winning -- the World Cup.","Palestinians stage 16-team soccer ""World Cup"" in Gaza .

"(CNN) -- A former Communist-era naval base in east Europe could soon become the most important new European superyacht hub in decades. Porto Montenegro marina is being developed in the Bay of Kotor in southern Montenegro, the tiny former-Yugoslav nation, a region with the lowest GDP in Europe. It is the brainchild of multi-millionaire gold miner Peter Munk who hopes his plans will turn this area into a glamorous and economically thriving hotspot to rival the likes of Monaco, Cannes and Portofino. To this end, the bay, with its picturesque mountains, is undergoing a transformation that will leave it decorated with luxury penthouses, upmarket shopping boulevards and the capacity to hold 600 yachts in its harbor. But despite the grandness of the development, it was not so long ago that 82-year-old Munk, thought the scheme an impossible dream. ""I never thought I'd have the opportunity to put all this into practice,"" said Monk, who is CEO of Barrik Gold, the world's largest gold mining company. ""Where would I get the chance to create the perfect port in Europe, somewhere that's large and protected, where the water is deep and where the government is co-operating? It would be a chance in a million,"" he said. So how did he get from notions of a ""fantasy port"" to the very real Porto Montenegro development? It was some chance comments that piqued his interest back in 2000, in his former role as chairman and CEO of the largest Canadian/US real-estate firm Trizec Properties, which had interests throughout Central Europe. Advisors recommended having a look at Montenegro, in those days part of the rump of former Yugoslavia. ""The Canadian ambassador in Belgrade also recommended it to me. He said I should have a look next time I'm in Europe,"" he says. In 2003, he was flown in a government helicopter over the Bay of Kotor. This huge, mountain-fringed harbor had been hidden from view for decades, during its time housing the Tivat naval base, home of the Yugoslav navy. Foreign charts were out of date and there had been a 30-mile no-fly zone over the bay. The location was for many years, quite literally, off the radar. When Monk saw the bay he was gobsmacked. ""I absolutely flipped. I dropped my knickers. I'd never seen anywhere as beautiful in my life,"" he said. This was the virgin territory he had been waiting for and he met with Montenegrin Prime Minister, Milo Dukanovic, who told him that they were keen to privatize some military assets, including the base at Tivat. Next came the money: ""That was easy. I just got some friends involved. They are all yachtsmen."" Today, Porto Montenegro is making strides, with phase one complete and over 85 boats of all sizes in place. ""Our investment is a transformational investment, not just of the base, but of the country,"" says Munk. The first fruits of this can be seen with a range of developments in the region -- hotels -- built to planning restrictions that mean this will hopefully not become yet another concrete jungle -- a golf course, and international flights to Tivat airport. ""People have seen that if we can attract hundreds of yachts it will open up the whole country. They see the wealth that comes from the big yachts, which provide the employment, the foreign currency, the purchasing power."" He adds: ""We're not taking a dollar out. We're putting in an infrastructure, we're educating, we're attracting other investors. We're creating roads, buildings, pure water, an image. ""We're investing hundreds of millions of dollars. In the meantime 60 to 70 Montenegrins can work for us directly at an income level unknown under communism."" Subscribe to SuperYachtWorld . COPYRIGHT Â©  2010 IPC MEDIA LTD.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Somalia is ""one of the world's most complicated humanitarian crises,"" with 40 percent of the population relying on United Nations aid for survival, the U.N.'s envoy to the troubled African nation told the Security Council Wednesday. Somalia ""challenges the rules of statehood,"" Mark Bowden, U.N. humanitarian and resident coordinator for Somalia, said. The country's central government is extremely weak and the drought-stricken nation is essentially lawless. What security does exist is provided by militias and rebel groups. And clashes between rebel groups and government forces have been especially fierce since 2009, when the current moderate president came to power. Bowden emphasized the importance of continued U.N. funding to ""sustain assistance to this most acute humanitarian crisis."" Civilians ""bear the main brunt of current conflict,"" Bowden reported to the Security Council. Numbers tell a story of misery. Some 1.2 million Somalis have been forced from their home villages or regions. About 200,000 were forced from the capital of Mogadishu this year alone. Since March, the country has suffered 3,000 conflict-related casualties. One in five Somali children is undernourished. Much of the country's violence is fueled by the need for basic resources, Bowden said. Food riots have ""been the pattern of what's happened in Mogadishu for the last 18 years,"" he told the 15-member Security Council. Bowden was pressed by council members on recent allegations that aid to Somalia has been siphoned off by Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-affiliated Somali group. Bowden said that allegations of misuse were taken very seriously and officials are addressing the problem. Bowden's findings were not totally negative. Thanks to U.N. aid, 1.3 million Somalis now have access to clean water and vaccination campaigns are continuing even in areas occupied by insurgent groups, Bowden said. Somalia has been kept polio-free at a time when many other African nations are seeing a resurgence of the disease, Bowden said.","U.N. coordinator details dire situation in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's top security official says the Sinaloa drug cartel was likely behind the kidnapping of a group of four journalists, two of whom were freed in a police rescue. The kidnappers wanted to use the reporters, who were connected with some of Mexico's largest news organizations, to force the media to transmit ""criminal messages,"" Mexican Public Safety Secretary Genaro Garcia Luna told reporters Saturday. A federal police rescue freed two of the four journalists, who were kidnapped Monday while covering a riot at a prison in the northern state of Durango, Garcia Luna said. A third was released Thursday. But the whereabouts of the fourth reporter were unclear Sunday. The two rescued journalists sat beside Garcia Luna and described their captivity to reporters Saturday. ""It is a sad and bitter experience that nobody wants even the worst of their enemies to go through,"" Multimedios camerman Javier Canales said, noting that he suffered psychological abuse and threats. ""Since the moment they took us, we thought they were going to kill us,"" Televisa Laguna photojournalist Alejandro Hernandez said, according to state news agency Notimex. Their kidnapping was a high-profile reminder of an issue that has been increasingly common amid Mexico's escalating drug war: violence against the journalists who cover it. The journalists were kidnapped Monday while reporting on a protest by inmates and relatives at a local prison, which made news after Mexico's Attorney General's office revealed guards there let free a squad of imprisoned hit men to carry out a massacre of 17 people in a nearby town. The journalists were abducted in the Laguna region, Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights said -- an area which has been the scene of vicious fighting between the Zetas crime group and the Sinaloa cartel. It includes the state of Durango and parts of neighboring Coahuila. On Friday, the signal of one of Mexico's largest television networks faded to black for almost an hour as a symbolic protest. ""We will not pretend that nothing is happening,"" said Denise Maerker, anchor of Televisa's ""Punto de Partida"" as she opened the show. Critics have said the government does not do enough to hold criminals accountable. On Friday, Mexico City's Milenio newspaper published an editorial calling on the government to step up its game to solve the hostage situation. In the editorial, journalist Ciro Gomez Leyva alluded to demands from the kidnappers for the media to publish certain images in return for the release of the journalists. ""That is not our duty. The media is not designed nor equipped to negotiate in a hostage situation,"" Gomez wrote. Garcia Luna said Saturday that investigations would continue to determine who was responsible. ""The Mexican state is above any criminal organization or group and is much stronger than these organizations,"" he said. The powerful Sinaloa cartel, which Garcia Luna said may have been behind the kidnapping, transports multi-ton quantities of drugs from Mexico to the U.S., according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Forbes magazine has estimated the fortune of its leader, JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n Loera, at $1 billion. He escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The human cost of the Afghan conflict is escalating, with killings and attacks on children by the Taliban and other insurgent groups soaring, the United Nations said in a report released Tuesday. ""Afghan children and women are increasingly bearing the brunt of this conflict,"" says Staffan de Mistura, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general. ""They are being killed and injured in their homes and communities in greater numbers than ever before."" According to the United Nations' 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict, in the first six months of this year, 55 percent more children were killed or wounded by the Taliban and other anti-government groups than in the same period in 2009. The number of women killed or wounded by the Taliban and other insurgents increased by six percent. The report says casualties caused by pro-government forces, including the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Afghan security forces, fell 30 percent in the first six months of 2010. From January 1 to June 30, 2010, the UNAMA Human Rights Unit documented a total of 3,268 civilian casualties, including 1,271 deaths and 1,997 injuries. Anti-government forces were responsible for 2,477 casualties. That is 76 percent of all casualties, up 53 percent from 2009. Pro-government forces were responsible for 386 civilian casualties, 12 percent of all casualties, down from 30 percent in 2009. The United Nations notes two lethal developments: Insurgents, it says, are using more improvised explosive devices (IEDs) throughout the country and are assassinating and executing more civilians. IEDs alone accounted for 29 percent of all civilian deaths in the period, including 74 children, a 155-percent surge from the same span last year. Assassinations and executions, meanwhile, soared by more than 95 percent and included the public executions of children. Aerial attacks are the most harmful tactic used by ISAF forces, causing 69 of the 223 civilian deaths attributed to pro-government forces in the first six months of 2010 -- a total of 31 percent -- and injuring 45 Afghan civilians. However, civilian deaths caused by aerial attacks decreased 64 percent from the same period in 2009, according to the report. The United Nations says this reflects greater implementation of an ISAF tactical directive from July 2009 on regulating the use of airstrikes and other measures to reduce civilian casualties. ISAF, in a statement, said the new U.N. report is consistent with figures tracked by ISAF headquarters. It quoted Gen. David Petraeus's new tactical directive, in which he says, ""We must continue our emphasis on reducing the loss of innocent civilian life to an absolute minimum. ""Every Afghan death diminishes our cause. While we have made progress in our efforts to reduce coalition-caused civilian casualties, we know the measure by which our mission will be judged is protecting the population from harm by either side. We will redouble our efforts to prevent insurgents from harming their neighbors.""","New U.N. report says killings and attacks in Afghanistan are soaring .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A fighter jet crashed in southern Afghanistan on Monday, in the fourth wreck in three days, authorities said. A French Air Force Mirage 2000 sits under a shelter on the tarmac at an airbase in Kandahar on January 1, 2009. Authorities were looking into why the plane went down during takeoff from Kandahar airfield Monday morning, but the role of insurgents had been ruled out, said Lt. Col. Paul Kolken, the spokesman at the airfield. The crew ejected safely, and was being treated, Kolken said. Five hours after the crash, the wreckage of the plane was still on fire. Military officials did not identify the type of jet that crashed, nor did they release the nationality of the crew. Weather conditions were fair at the time of the incident, Kolken said. On Saturday, a U.S. fighter jet crashed in eastern Afghanistan, killing its crew of two. In addition, a civilian helicopter went down on takeoff from Kandahar airfield on Sunday, killing 16 people, NATO said.  Watch details of the helicopter crash Â» .

"(CNN) -- The Nixon Presidential Library released 154 hours of tape recordings and 30,000 pages of documents from the Nixon White House on Tuesday, offering a revealing look at the state of mind of America's 37th president at the start of what would prove to be his disastrous abbreviated second term. President Richard Nixon smiles and waves to a supporter in Washington in January 1973. The recordings, encompassing almost 1,000 conversations in January and February of 1973, cover a range of topics, including, among other things, the conclusion of the Vietnam Paris peace talks, the Supreme Court's controversial Roe v. Wade abortion rights ruling, the death of former President Lyndon Johnson, and a rapidly metastasizing Watergate scandal. They show President Richard Nixon at both his best -- delving into the intricacies of Cold War diplomacy -- and his worst, plotting against his perceived political enemies in the media and elsewhere. Still basking in the afterglow of a landslide 49-state reelection in 1972, Nixon at one point tells aide Charles Colson that he wants nothing to do with those who would advise reaching out to critics in order to try and unify the country. ""Those people that wanted me to have [an] 'era of good feelings' ... Somebody wrote me a memorandum about that and I told [White House Chief of Staff H.R.] Haldeman if anyone ever showed me that again I'm gonna flush them down the goddamn john,"" Nixon says. ""You should,"" Colson replies. At another point, Nixon tells then-Republican National Committee Chairman George H.W. Bush that the GOP can further boost its electoral fortunes by recruiting ""attractive"" women to run for office. Recounting a recent visit to the South Carolina state legislature, Nixon tells Bush that he ""noticed a couple of very attractive women, both of them Republicans. ... I want you to be sure to emphasize to our people, God, let's look for some. ... Understand, I don't do it because I'm for women, but I'm doing it because I think maybe a woman might win someplace where a man might not. ... So have you got that in mind?"" Bush replies that he'll ""certainly keep it in mind."" Nixon also indicates a deep distrust of his senior Cabinet officers, telling Colson on January 5, 1973, to start keeping a detailed log of phone calls made by then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger. ""Incidentally, I want it on his private phone too,"" Nixon tells Colson. ""We can get that, can't we?"" Colson then replies that he thinks it can be done. ""Sure, goddamn it. We can get it through the FBI,"" Nixon replies. ""The FBI is to get, to keep the log, on his phone. That's all we want to know, who the hell he calls."" The tapes often show Nixon with a penchant for fixating on even the smallest political disruptions. On January 20, 1973 -- the day of his second inauguration -- Nixon calls a Secret Service agent to say he ""saw the incident where some kid tried to rush the car... I want to be sure they file a charge against him [and don't] just let him go."" The agent assures Nixon that the protester has been put in custody and that a charge has been filed. The Nixon Presidential Library, in Yorba Linda, California, has been operated by the National Archives since 2007.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Hundreds of runners braved their luck Wednesday on the first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona -- but just two men, an Australian and a Spaniard, were taken to hospital afterward with injuries, the Navarra regional government said. It was considered a thrilling but safe start to the annual tradition in Pamplona, which has tallied 14 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924, including the fatal goring of a Spanish man last year, and thousands of injuries. The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" It is now broadcast live across Spain by state television TVE, which estimated there were more than a thousand runners. An 18-year-old Australian man from Melbourne was taken to hospital with various injuries sustained on the narrow street that descends into the bullring. And a Spanish man, 20, from Zaragoza also went to hospital with an eye injury sustained on a street almost halfway through the run, the Navarra regional government said on its website. Both were initially listed in stable condition but under close observation, the website said. It took the six bulls and a pack of tame steers, which help guide the bulls, a full 17 seconds to emerge from the corrals after the opening rocket was fired to signal the start of the run. But the pack then moved swiftly through the cobblestone streets of old Pamplona along the 825-meter (902-yard) course to the bullring, where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight. The run lasted just 2 minutes and 23 seconds and the bull and steer pack stayed mainly together, which long-time observers say usually means a safer run -- unlike when a bull or bulls get separated, frightened and may charge directly into the runners. Television images showed mostly men dressed in the traditional white outfits with red handkerchiefs, but also a small number of women, and even one man with a football helmet, which is prohibited but was apparently not noticed by the hundreds of police officers who eject, before the run, people carrying cameras or who are drunk. The aim is safety, so that runners can focus on the run. Television images showed numerous runners making hard falls to the pavement, tripping over other runners or colliding with the bulls. The daily run continues for eight days, through July 14, at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET), and is the highlight of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona that attracts hundreds of thousands to the non-stop fiesta.","1 Austrialian, 1 Spaniard taken to hospital .

"Duisburg, Germany (CNN) -- As Germany paused Saturday to honor those who died at a German music festival last week, the pastor leading a memorial service sought to comfort those who lost loved ones, telling them ""love is stronger than death."" Pastor Nikolaus Schneider spoke at the memorial at the Salvator Church in Duisburg. The church was the center of observances in the northern German town. Thousands of people came for the service, which was intended to honor the 21 people who died and more than 500 people who were injured at the Love Parade music festival on July 24. Schneider told mourners that they should not sacrifice their trust in God or their zest for life as even the ""the Love Parade became a dance of death."" Hannelore Kraft, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, cried audibly during the service. She spoke at length afterwards, promising a full investigation into the incident. She also had a message for those who lost loved ones, telling them to ""open your hearts to those who want to give you comfort"" and assuring them ""you are not alone."" The service was broadcast at 14 other churches in town and at the local soccer arena, where about 1,000 people turned out to watch. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulff both cut short their holidays to be at the service. Duisburg Mayor Adolf Sauerland was not there, however, after reports he had received death threats for allowing the Love Parade festival to take place in the city. The day began with a candle procession from the scene of the tragedy to Salvator Church and the arena. The church can accommodate about 500 people, and the seats were reserved mainly for relatives of the victims. Joachim Mueller-Lange, the vicar responsible for emergency spiritual healing, said all the families of those killed had been invited, including some who live abroad. Some families did not attend because burials were being held Saturday, while others declined because they wished for something more private, he said. A remembrance ceremony was also held at the Duisburg synagogue. The fatal crush happened July 24 in an underpass between the main event site and an expansion area. Witnesses told CNN affiliate NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. People were crushed against the walls and one another, losing consciousness and creating panic. The Duisburg public prosecutor's office said 511 were injured. Police cordoned off the underpass Saturday to prevent a similar scene among mourners who may go to pay their respects. Merkel has called for a thorough investigation into the incident and said she was ""horrified and saddened"" by the tragedy. Some 1.4 million people had shown up at the popular festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours, Carsten Leub of NTV said. Organizers had expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so they opened an additional event site to accommodate more people. The numbers are disputed by police, who say the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000, and at no time was it filled to capacity. Witnesses told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. An additional entryway had been opened before the accident to relieve some of the pressure. Police are investigating the cause of the back-up in the underpass.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court is backing Ohio elections officials in an ongoing dispute over allegations of voter registration fraud. Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner filed the emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices in an unsigned opinion Friday blocked a lower court order directing the Ohio Secretary of State -- a Democrat -- to update the state's voter registration database after information provided by some newly registered voters did not match up with Social Security and driver registration numbers. The state Republican party had asked for enforcement of a temporary restraining order, but the justices ultimately denied that request. The appeal, from Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner and other elections officials, follows a Tuesday ruling from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati that sided with the state GOP. It ordered Brunner to create a system by Friday to provide a list of newly registered voters whose Social Security numbers or driver's license numbers do not match their names. By reversing the lower courts decision, Brunner said in a statement that the Supreme Court's had ""protected the voting rights of all Ohioans, allowing our bipartisan elections officials to continue preparing for a successful November election. ""We filed this appeal to protect all Ohio voters from illegal challenges and barriers that unfairly silence the votes of some to the advantage of others,"" she said. The state Republican Party contends that there is widespread voter fraud in Ohio -- a crucial battleground state for the 2008 presidential election -- and that Brunner ""turned off"" its process for verifying voter registrations while allowing Ohioans to cast ballots on the same day they registered. In reaction to the high court's decision state GOP Chairman Bob Bennett said in a statement, ""This decision was made on a technicality, not on the merits of the case."" ""We are again calling on the Secretary of State to comply with federal law by providing clear instructions to election administrators on how to handle questionable voter registration forms,"" Bennett said. Bennett had accused Brunner of concealing fraudulent voter registrations in hopes of swinging the state to Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate. Brunner's office has acknowledged that preliminary information provided by about 200,000 registered voters may not match up. Brunner said Tuesday she had prepared for the appeals court's ""possible adverse decision"" ahead of time by announcing plans to ""further improve the statewide voter registration database."" The appeals court opinion called Ohio's current system ""virtually useless"" and said it does ""nothing to address the anti-fraud objective.""","NEW: Secretary of state says high court ""protected the voting rights of all Ohioans""

"(CNN) -- The son of an Iranian woman facing imprisonment and possible execution by stoning has been told that Iranian authorities will contact him about his mother's case Thursday, a human rights activist said Sunday. Mina Ahadi, chairwoman of the International Committee Against Stoning and Execution, said authorities contacted the son of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani on Sunday. They did not specify the nature of the information he would receive on Thursday. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006, and was originally sentenced to death by stoning. Iranian authorities say the sentence has been put on hold, but there have been no reports as to whether a new sentence has been imposed. The 43-year-old mother of two is reportedly still being held held in Tabriz prison. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by another means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. Ashtiani's attorney, Mohammad Mostafaei, told CNN earlier this month that his client confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. He said she later recanted the confession and denied any wrongdoing. Mostafaei has gone into hiding since last weekend after being interrogated by Iranian authorities, human rights groups say. Advocates and Mostafaei say his wife and brother-in-law are being held by Iranian authorities. A letter believed to be written by Mostafaei was posted on the Internet on Saturday, calling for the release of his relatives. The lawyer says he has cooperated with interrogators, and says his wife and brother-in-law are victims of of ""hostage taking."" Mostafaei said he and his family are innocent of any wrongdoing.

"(CNN) -- A sweeping drug bust in Puerto Rico involving more than 500 U.S. drug agents and Puerto Rican police early Friday is being described by officials as the biggest drug trafficking arrest/operation ever conducted on the Caribbean island. ""This ... massive operation rid the west coast of Puerto Rico of the most hard-core and violent traffickers terrorizing this part of the Island,"" said Javier F. Pena, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Caribbean Division, in a joint statement released by that agency and the Department of Justice. In the statement, authorities announced that a federal grand jury indicted 158 people -- including drug ring leaders, suppliers, supervisors, runners and sellers -- as a result of the joint investigation. The defendants are charged in three different indictments with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin, crack, cocaine and marijuana, as well as conspiracy to possess firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, the statement said. If convicted, the defendants would face a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum of life imprisonment, with fines of up to $4 million. Many of the arrests were made at a public housing complex near schools and sport facilities where officials expect some 300,000 visitors and 600 athletes from about 33 countries for the Central American and Caribbean Games, according to the statement. The games start July 17 in Mayaguez.","Biggest drug trafficking arrest-operation ever conducted on Puerto Rico, officials say .

"(CNN) -- An Iranian court may render the final verdict Thursday in the case of Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani, sentenced to death by stoning in Iran for allegedly committing adultery. That case was placed under review after her attorney, Mohammad Mostafaei, helped launch a worldwide campaign to clear her. Now, as Ashtiani's two children wait to hear word of their mother's fate, Mostafaei's family must also await word of his. That's because Mostafaei, a prominent human rights lawyer, was being held Wednesday at a detention center in Istanbul, Turkey, where he has requested asylum, said Metin Corabatir, a representative in Turkey for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. He allegedly entered the country with improper documentation, the agency said. Turkey does not require visas for citizens from neighboring Iran to enter the country. As a result, it is the first place hundreds of Iranians fled to after the Iranian government cracked down on opposition activists and critics over the past year. Human rights groups are urging officials to grant his asylum request because they say he could be in grave danger if he is forced to return to Iran. There is no word yet on whether any nation is willing to accept him. Mostafaei went into hiding July 24, after facing a lengthy interrogation at Iran's notorious Evin prison, the same day rallies were being held worldwide to draw attention to the Ashtiani case. His wife and brother-in-law were reportedly arrested that night at his office in Tehran as they tried to gather his belongings. The Iranian government has since released Mostafaei's brother-in-law, but human rights groups said they are holding his wife as collateral until Mostafaei returns. In a now widely circulated open letter reportedly penned by Mostafaei and posted on the internet, the lawyer accused Iranian authorities of holding his wife ""hostage."" He also explained why he made the painful choice of leaving his wife behind. ""Despite the arrest of the person I love most in my life, I decided not to ever set foot in a judicial office where the interrogators do not abide by any basic laws,"" he wrote. ""Hostage taking is never legal"" Mostafaei said. ""I decided not to appear unless the interrogator's office tries hard enough to come and arrest me in my silo that I have built for myself."" Mostafaei was asked by CNN in early July if he was worried about his safety after bringing so much attention to Ashtiani, who was convicted of adultery in 2006 and condemned to die by the brutal method of stoning. Mostafaei told CNN that he knew the risks -- he had been detained briefly after Iran's post-election turmoil in June 2009 -- but that would not stop him fighting for human rights. But it was that very fight that forced him to flee the country he calls home. As part of that open letter, Mostafaei cried out to the Iranian government -- and to God -- for the strange twist in his fate. ""For the past few years all my thoughts have been towards saving people who did not deserve to die."" he wrote. ""I was so occupied with saving these people that I hardly got to see my dear wife and daughter. ... And for someone who has always worked towards justice and the interests of the Islamic Republic, is this the way I am paid back for my God-loving and human-loving actions?"" ""I leave you and your interrogator at the mercy of God, the creator,"" he continued. ""I hope that you won't let my child cry for her mother, not eating food and wanting her mother back. She needs to hug her mother. If through this separation from her mother she gets hurt, it's a sin that you have committed."" The Iranian government has not commented on the detention of Mostafaei's wife. Meanwhile, human rights activists are urging the international community not to forget Ashtiani, who may soon die. Nor the man who tried to set her free. CNN's Ivan Watson and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Prominent human rights lawyer Mohammad Mostafaei is being held in Turkey .

"(CNN) -- Misty Croslin, the last person known to see a 5-year-old Florida girl before she was reported missing on February 9, 2009, faces a sentence of up to 210 years in prison after pleading no contest Monday to unrelated drug charges. Croslin entered no contest pleas to seven counts of trafficking prescription drugs before a Putnam County, Florida, judge, said Chris Kelly, a spokesman for the state attorney's office. Each first-degree count carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Croslin has a St. John's County court appearance Tuesday on a single trafficking charge. All the counts stem from a series of incidents between around January of this year, during which Croslin allegedly sold hydrocodone to undercover officers. Calls to Croslin's attorney, Robert Fields, were not immediately returned Monday. Kelly said that in terms of sentencing, there's no distinction between pleading no contest to a felony and pleading guilty. At the time Haleigh Cummings went missing, Croslin was 17 and lived in the family's mobile home with her then-husband, Ronald Cummings, and the girl and her 4-year-old brother. Croslin and Ronald Cummings were both arrested in January along with three others after allegedly selling about $3,900 worth of drugs to undercover officers, authorities said. The two divorced after Haleigh's disappearance. Croslin told police she tucked Haleigh and the brother into bed about 8 p.m. February 8, 2009, and went to sleep two hours later. She said she awoke at 3 a.m. to find Haleigh missing and a cinder block propping open a back door. Ronald Cummings reported Haleigh missing when he returned from work at dawn. Police have said Cummings and Crystal Sheffield, the girl's mother, are not considered suspects. Authorities believe Haleigh is dead and are treating the case as a homicide investigation. Authorities have previously said physical evidence contradicts Croslin's account of the events that night. However, police have stopped short of naming Croslin as a suspect. In televised interviews, Croslin has said she does not know what happened to Haleigh but believes ""the other side of the family"" knows where she is.","Misty Croslin pleads no contest to seven counts of drug trafficking .

"(CNN) -- Four days after an al Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for targeting an oil tanker, the United Arab Emirates government has acknowledged that it was indeed attacked, state media said Friday. The government had earlier said the tanker was passing through the Strait of Hormuz when it was exposed to a high wave as a result of an earthquake shock. However, the state news agency WAM reported, the tanker ""was the target of a terrorist attack while passing through international waters near the Strait of Hormuz."" Workers fixed the damage to the vessel and the attack caused no human injuries or oil spills, the agency said. The militant Islamist group claimed responsibility for the explosion aboard the oil tanker on Monday. In a statement posted on various websites that regularly carry messages from al Qaeda leaders, the Abdullah Azzam Brigades included a picture of a man they claimed carried out a suicide attack on the tanker on July 28. The group said the attack was intended to ""strike an economic blow to the infidels."" It is believed to be behind several attacks in the Middle East, including the October 2004 attack on a hotel and nearby camp sites in Egypt that killed more than three dozen people. The statement from the Abdullah Azzam Brigades said the attack on the tanker was the ""conquest of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman"" -- a reference to the imprisoned blind cleric who inspired the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York.","State agency says attack was terror-related .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- When we started thinking about the contents of this piece, our first thought was to highlight all of the progress, accomplishments and successes that the St. Bernard Project has achieved since Katrina. We thought of numbers: 302 -- the number of homes that the St. Bernard Project has rebuilt; 85 -- the number of residents who utilize our free evidenced-based clinical services at our Center for Wellness and Mental Health each week. We thought of all of those who have made it possible: 25,000 volunteers; nearly 1,000 AmeriCorps members; companies like Entergy, Patron Tequila, KPMG, GE and United Way, and citizens like Ari Mittleman, who has made 20 volunteer trips over the past four years, and the Solon family from Massachusetts, who has raised enough funds to move three families home and who spent the summer volunteering with the project. Then, we remembered Mr. Andre, an 82-year old St. Bernard Parish resident who was a World War II veteran and who, when we met him six months after Katrina was still sleeping each night in his Ford Ranger pickup while waiting for a FEMA trailer that he would not receive for another six weeks. As we were saying goodbye to Mr. Andre, he made a simple request: ""Don't forget us. We want to come home. We all want to come home."" When we thought about Mr. Andre, we realized a few things: First, the St. Bernard Project's successes are dwarfed by the progress that the greater New Orleans area has made. Second, despite the progress, significant work is left. The New Orleans area is a wonderful place to live, and the city is, in many ways, thriving. Families are reuniting, neighborhoods are being restored, and there is a shared sense of pride in the region's resilience. In Mayor Mitch Landrieu, we have a leader who is committed to uniting the city and bringing to government the true character of New Orleans' residents: inclusion, hard work and problem solving. An entrepreneurial movement is surging through the city, led by GNO Inc., Tulane University and Idea Village. Thanks to New Schools for New Orleans, there are dozens of highly effective charter schools, like Akili Academy, and because of a revitalized public school board, the chances are much better that children will receive the education that they deserve. Nearly five years after Katrina, we need to celebrate success, but we also need to honor Mr. Andre's request. We can not forget the people who are not yet home. All of the above-mentioned successes are great, but they mean less to American families who are still waiting to move home. Today, nearly 900 families who own homes are still living in FEMA trailers. More than 6,000 families own homes that they can not afford to rebuild. Rental prices have risen so that 49 percent of the population cannot afford the average cost of a home to rent. All too many family-centered neighborhoods now are pocked with blighted houses or vacant lots. As much as we would all like it to be, the recovery is not complete. That is where Saints quarterback Drew Breese and his war cry come in. To keep our pledge to Mr. Andre, all stakeholders -- Louisiana citizens, volunteers from around the world, corporations and local, state and federal government -- need to follow the command Breese made to his fellow Saints late last football season and ""finish strong."" In football, finishing strong means playing hard through all four quarters and through every game of the season. In Louisiana's recovery, finishing strong means: . â¢ Governmental leadership that makes decisions that impact residents in ways that the leaders would want their own families to be impacted. â¢ Creating schools so that our community members' children are educated the way that we would want our children to be educated. â¢ Americans and corporations not viewing community as being limited by proximity and instead, like the hundreds of thousands of volunteers, working hard to help American families rebuild their homes. â¢ Understanding that the recovery is not complete until all residents are back in safe and humane homes. By following Breese's command, the Saints won the Super Bowl. By remembering Mr. Andre's words and by listening to Breese, we can win the recovery.

"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday that he has ""no regrets"" about his comments last week supporting the rights of Muslims to build an Islamic center and mosque two blocks from the site of the September 11 terror attacks in New York. ""The answer is no regrets,"" Obama said when asked about bringing up the issue Friday at a White House dinner commemorating the start of Islamic holy month of Ramadan. At the dinner, Obama said that those wanting to build the Islamic center and mosque have the constitutional right to religious freedom. On Saturday, he clarified that he was talking only about the right to build the center and not the ""wisdom"" of doing so close to ""ground zero,"" where more than 2,700 people died when planes hijacked by terrorists slammed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The remarks sparked a national debate on the emotional issue, with many Republicans condemning the president as insensitive to families of victims and out of touch with the views of most Americans. Many Democrats responded that the right to religious freedom applies to all Americans, though some -- including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- said they oppose having the Islamic center so close to ground zero. A CNN poll showed that 70 percent of respondents opposed having an Islamic center near the site. A separate poll released Wednesday by the Siena Research Institute found that 63 percent opposed it, but 64 percent said the center's developers have a constitutional right to build it.","President Obama's remarks last week became a political issue .

"New York (CNN) -- Amtrak Northeast Corridor service between New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, continued to be affected by ongoing signal problems Wednesday in New Jersey, Amtrak said in a 10 a.m. statement. In addition, while New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor service improved as the morning progressed, the line was still suffering delays into the afternoon, the railroad's website said in a 12:24 p.m. update. The outage was caused by a downed tree that fell into the overhead wire system near Hamilton, New Jersey, Amtrak said. As a result, Amtrak trains were moving at greatly reduced speeds, with some trains canceled due to associated congestion. Amtrak said its personnel were working to repair the problem, but passengers should expect westbound/southbound delays of 90 to 120 minutes and 60 to 90 minute eastbound/northbound delays. No trains were stranded between stations, and passengers were being re-accommodated on other trains where available, Amtrak said. Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole couldn't say how long trains would be traveling with reduced speed and frequency before service would be completely restored. New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor service between New Brunswick, New Jersey, and New York was back on schedule or close to on schedule in both directions, according to the transit website. However, 30- to 45-minute delays plagued the Northeast Corridor line into the afternoon because of signal problems, the website said. Service was suspended most of the morning in both directions between Trenton, New Jersey, and New Brunswick, because of the signal problems. Passengers were advised to get on the 11:17 a.m. train departing from Trenton. Transit and suburban buses were accepting rail tickets and passes for fares Wednesday morning, the website said.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean fishing boat and its four crew members were heading home Saturday after being held for a month in North Korea, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. South Korean fishing boats anchored at Geojin port, Goseong, South Korea, August 1. The Yeonan-ho and its crew were handed over to a South Korean patrol boat waiting at the sea border Saturday evening, Yonhap reported, citing South Korean maritime police. North Korean officials captured the vessel and its crew July 30 after the boat strayed deep into North Korean territorial waters, North's Korean Central News Agency reported at the time. South Korea's Defense and Unification Ministry said the 29-ton vessel had been returning from its fishing operations and mistakenly crossed seven miles into North Korean waters in the process, according to Yonhap. South and North Korea have remained in conflict since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953. The war ended in a truce but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Rapprochement talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008. He had a tougher stance toward the North than his liberal predecessor, Roh Moo-Hyun. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. Several steps in the past week have hinted at a thaw in relations, however. Last week, the two sides had the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years. On Friday, the countries reached an agreement on future reunions for families separated for decades by the Korean War. The agreement on reunions came after three days of talks between the two sides, mediated by the Red Cross, in North Korea, Yonhap reported. Reunions will be held from September 26 to October 1 at Mt. Keumgang, Yonhap reported.","Reunions for divided families to be held from September 26 to October 1 .

"(CNN) -- Accused ""Craigslist killer"" Philip Markoff wrote his ex-fiancee's name in what appeared to be blood on the wall of his jail cell before dying ""at his own hand,"" a Massachusetts prosecutor said Tuesday. Markoff was found dead in his jail cell in Boston on Sunday morning, Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said. The evidence collected so far indicates the onetime medical student killed himself by cutting himself multiple times with a makeshift scalpel crafted from a pen and a piece of metal, Conley told reporters. The words ""Megan"" and ""pocket"" were scrawled on the wall when he was found, Conley said. Megan appears to refer to Markoff's former fiancee, Megan McAllister, but investigators had not divined the meaning of ""pocket,"" the prosecutor said. ""We're still studying that,"" he said. Markoff, 24, was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine when arrested in April 2009. He had pleaded not guilty. McAllister, his fiancee, maintained Markoff's innocence, but the couple broke off their engagement shortly after his arrest. While toxicology reports are still out, ""At this point we can definitively say he's responsible for taking his own life,"" Conley said. Surveillance video from the jail shows no one entered Markoff's private cell between the time he shut off his light early Sunday morning and the time he was found dead about eight hours later, he said. ""He inflicted a series of puncture wounds and incisions on his body, including his neck, arms, wrist and ankles,"" Conley said. ""He hit several veins and the carotid artery in his neck. All of these wounds are consistent with suicide."" A large, clear plastic bag of a type issued to inmates was fastened around his neck with a piece of gauze, and a second bag was fastened around his feet, Conley said. An autopsy found his death to be the result of a combination of blood loss and asphyxiation. Markoff was charged with the April 14, 2009, fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds service Craigslist, and Markoff might have met her through the site. He also faced charges in connection with robberies of women at hotels in Boston and in Warwick, Rhode Island. In the Rhode Island incident, police said, the robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. Conley said Markoff's death deprives Brisman's family of seeing justice pronounced, but said the evidence against the suspect was ""overwhelming in quantity and substance."" ""This death should not divert attention from what really happened here,"" he said. ""It should not obscure the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Markoff by the brutality of his crime. It is in no small way the ultimate indicator of consciousness of guilt.""","Prosecutors say ""Megan"" and ""pocket"" were scrawled on Markoff's cell wall .

"(CNN) -- A police officer shut down an impromptu concert by Switchfoot front man Jon Foreman Sunday night, escorting him away from a group of fans outside a Tampa amphitheatre. ""Just got forcefully removed from my aftershow by the police... Officer Fisher grabbed me by the arm and shut us down. Really?!?,"" Foreman said in a post to his Twitter account. Switchfoot played a concert with the Goo Goo Dolls at the 1-800 Ask-Gary Amphitheatre at the Florida State Fairgrounds Sunday. ""Over the years, I've had a few policeman shut these after-shows down. Maybe they are nervous because these types of gatherings are unusual,"" Foreman said in an e-mail Monday. ""Many times on tour I play after our show when time allows. The after-shows are all about the love of the music -- all acoustic: no amps, no mics, no tickets, just a couple tunes and whoever wants to listen. I see it as a chance to connect with music in a different way."" The crowd showed up when Foreman tweeted to fans, asking them to meet him after the show. ""Aftershow tonight directy [sic] behind the ampitheatre [sic], be there in a 1/2 hour,"" said Foreman, who included links to a map showing the location and a picture of himself standing on a concrete barrier near the venue. Video of the incident posted on YouTube shows Foreman playing a couple of songs on an acoustic guitar with a collection of fans around him when the officer walks up and says, ""It's over.  It's over.  C'mon, let's go."" The officer identified himself as ""Fisher"" when Foreman asked who he was and offered to shake his hand. After the small crowd mildly protested, asking if one more song could be played, and Foreman hesitated to leave, the officer said, ""If I call somebody over here, we will be forcing you out.  So what do you want to do?"" The smiling Foreman offered his hand again, which the officer shook, and escorted the singer away. ""Thank you, Jon,"" several fans shouted as the crowd applauded. ""Thanks for singing along friends! We'll get the cops singing along next time...,"" Foreman tweeted. CNN contacted Tampa police, but a spokesman said he was not aware of an incident. ""The officer last night wouldn't give me a reason for shutting it down, he only said that he had a family to go home to,"" Foreman told CNN. I respect the authorities, they have a difficult job.""

""I love playing on the big stages in front of thousands of folks, it feels like a megaphone.  It's how I pay the bills and it's the best job in the world. But I also love playing for just a few folks for free. It feels like a whisper."" Foreman said of the intimate post-show gatherings he sometimes calls via Twitter.

During the stop, a trooper smelled marijuana, and a subsequent search turned up evidence of the drug, the patrol said. Haslem, who was driving a 2008 Mercedes, and his passenger, Antwain Fleming, were scheduled to be taken to the Miami-Dade County Jail. Both men were charged with possession of marijuana, according to the highway patrol.

"(CNN) -- Unemployed, single and apparently fed up with criticism from her mother, a 29-year-old Orangeburg, South Carolina, woman suffocated her two toddlers with her bare hands before strapping them into car seats and submerging her car in a river, authorities said Tuesday. Shaquan Duley is facing two counts of murder in the deaths of her sons, ages 1 and 2, said Orangeburg County Sheriff Larry Williams. She is set to appear in court Wednesday. ""She was a mother that was unemployed. She had no means of taking care of her children,"" Williams told reporters. ""She lives with her mother and her mother was a very, I guess, firm individual. ... She often talked with her daughter about, I guess, maybe being more of a mother or being more reliable."" Mother and daughter argued the night before the children's bodies were found early Monday in Duley's Chrysler sedan, submerged in the Edisto River, he said. ""We believe this is a direct response (to the argument) from Ms. Duley,"" he said. ""I believe she was just fed up with her mother telling her she couldn't take care of the children and she wasn't taking care of her children and she just wanted to be free."" However, he said, ""this wasn't a hardened criminal. This was a young lady in trouble, in trouble in more ways than she realized."" Duley has no previous criminal history, he said. Duley's third child, a 5-year-old daughter, was at the home of Duley's mother. Police identified the dead children as Ja'van T. Duley, age 1, and Devean C. Duley, 2. Under questioning, Duley told authorities she smothered the boys by putting her hand over their mouths at the Trumps Inn in Orangeburg, Williams said. She drove them to the river while ""trying to find a way to discard the bodies,"" he said. ""She just wanted to get rid of the children, as sad as it may be,"" Williams said. Authorities do not know how long the boys had been dead before they went into the water, he said. Duley initially reported that she had lost control of the car and it had rolled into the river. But authorities from the outset believed her story didn't add up, Williams said. Her clothes were dry, he said, and there were no skid marks or other indications of an accident at the scene. In addition, Duley reported she had walked a mile before flagging down a motorist to call for help, Williams said previously. The sheriff told CBS' ""The Early Show"" that she could have run to residences nearby. Authorities responded to a report of a car accident near a boat landing on the river Monday, and divers found the children's bodies. Williams said Monday he couldn't confirm reports that the key was still in the car's ignition, but he said the car apparently was in neutral. Ramona Milhouse told CNN she lives next to the boat landing, and her house and a neighbor's house are clearly visible from the road. She said she was at home around the time Duley told authorities she lost control of her car. ""I don't know why the young lady would walk that far when we are here, that's easy to see, and we have phones so we could have called someone for her,"" Milhouse said. In addition, she said, the road near the landing is a busy one. ""It's not a quiet country road,"" she said. ""There's a lot of people driving up and down, all parts of the day and night."" She said she did not see the car go into the water, but heard sirens as authorities responded. ""When I heard what happened, I just couldn't go to sleep at all, thinking about those two little boys,"" she said. It wasn't immediately known whether Duley had retained an attorney. Williams described Duley as distraught, but said she showed no signs of remorse. ""I don't believe she woke up and said, 'I'm going to the Shillings Bridge Road to get rid of my children,'"" he said. ""Of course, that hasn't been determined. I believe she was just angry, upset and for some reason found the boat ramp, but mind you the children were deceased ... so (she was) trying to find a way to discard the bodies."" The father of the two children has not been found, Williams said. Duley ""was more or less being mother and father for the children,"" he said. ""The mom has basically been a good mom,"" he said, but was just unable to financially support the children. ""For whatever reason, this was her weakest moment,"" he said. The South Carolina Department of Social Services has no record of prior involvement with Duley, department spokeswoman Marilyn Matheus said. The incident has striking similarities to a 1994 case, also in South Carolina. The bodies of Michael Daniel Smith, 3, and 14-month-old Alexander Tyler Smith were found in their mother's car, still strapped into their car seats, in John D. Long Lake in Union, South Carolina. Their mother, Susan Smith, was convicted on two counts of murder, but jurors opted to spare her the death penalty and she was sentenced to life in prison. The case inflamed racial tensions in Union, because Susan Smith claimed at first she had been carjacked by an African-American man. She stuck to that story for nine days, issuing tearful pleas for her sons' return on national media outlets, before confessing to authorities. Prosecutors alleged she killed her children after being rejected by a man she was dating who did not want children. Duley spent two years as a cashier at a Dairy-O fast-food restaurant a couple of years ago, said assistant manager Grace Simpson. ""She was such a good-natured person, very friendly, but quiet,"" Simpson recalled. ""Never disciplined. Never in trouble with our boss. She left because she chose to. We don't have health insurance here, and she wanted to just move on and up with her life maybe."" At the time Duley worked for Dairy-O, she did not have children, Simpson believes. Simpson did not know if she was married at the time. ""Whatever compelled Shaquan to do what she did ... Lord please be with her,"" said Simpson. ""I cannot judge Shaquan. I will not judge her. But God, be kind to her."" HLN's Natisha Lance and CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Authorities say the children were dead before they went into the water .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of two children trapped inside a car submerged in the Edisto River in South Carolina have been recovered, and their mother has been arrested, authorities said Monday. State troopers responded to a report of a car accident early Monday and found a Chrysler sedan in the water near a boat landing in Orangeburg County. Divers discovered the bodies of the two boys, ages 1 and 2, which were taken from the car and sent to the county coroner for autopsies, authorities said. Their mother is 29-year-old Shaquan Duley, Sheriff Larry Williams told HLN's Nancy Grace. She was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of an accident. Williams said the boys' mother walked almost a mile before calling for help. While the woman described the incident as an accident, Williams told CNN that ""it has a stench of foul play."" It wasn't immediately known whether Duley had retained an attorney. Williams said he couldn't confirm reports that the key was still in the car's ignition, but he said the car apparently was in neutral. He added Duley didn't appear wet, saying, ""She didn't have any evidence that she had been submerged in the water."" The car went off a boat ramp that is about 10 yards off the roadway shoulder and sits at a 90-degree angle. ""She said she was going down road and lost control of vehicle and happened to be at juncture where boat ramp was,"" Williams told Grace. However, he added, ""There's no evidence that she ran off the road at any time."" The woman says she flagged a motorist down to use a cell phone to call in the incident, Williams said. Police are trying to track down that individual. Duley was questioned ""on and off"" Monday afternoon and expected to be booked at the jail sometime in the evening, the sheriff said earlier in the day. The boys' father, who doesn't live at the same residence as the children, has been interviewed by investigators, Williams said. The sheriff said he didn't know the father's whereabouts at the time of the incident. Duley has a third child, a 5-year-old daughter, who was at the home of her maternal grandmother where they all lived, he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Washington D.C. Metropolitan police car was incorrectly edited into a clip of ""The Real Housewives of D.C.,"" a publicist for the reality show's production company said Sunday. The information came to light a day after District police announced they would investigate whether reality stars Tareq and Michaele Salahi got a police escort for their limousine to attend a party, as depicted on this week's episode of the reality TV show. The Salahis grabbed headlines as ""White House crashers"" after attending President Barack Obama's first state dinner without an invitation in November. The party shown in this week's series took place the evening of October 13 at The Park at Fourteenth, six weeks before the White House event. ""Half Yard Productions reviewed all of the footage from the party in question and the police escort for the Salahi's limo was a Park Police escort,"" said Bronagh Hanley, a publicist for Half Yard, in an email to CNN. ""The MPD [Metropolitan Police Department] car featured in the episode was not the escort car and was edited into the shot incorrectly."" Lisa Bloom, the Salahis' lawyer, concurred that Metropolitan police were not involved in escorting her clients, but didn't know if there was an escort provide by Park Police. Bloom said all reality show contracts say producers can manipulate the facts, manipulate the video and there's nothing the talent can do about it. She said it really puts people in a bind. District police spokesman Lt. Nicholas Breul told CNN Saturday that they were alerted to the episode by a reporter who saw the reality show on TV. ""The chief has asked that an investigation be conducted into whether or not there was any type of an escort for the Salahis. We're working to identify the car and the officer."" Breul told CNN that the department typically provides escorts for the president of the United States and other dignitaries, but not for private citizens. ""Escorts are generally used for safety reasons to swiftly move people, and those are generally dignitaries, from one point or another,"" Breul told CNN. ""Generally speaking, there are no escorts for people going to parties or social functions."" According to the Washington Post, the markings on the police cruiser identify it as belonging to the police department's 3rd District. Capt. Juanita Mitchell, the watch commander for the 3rd District, did not know about the alleged escort. ""I have no knowledge of what you are referring to,"" Mitchell told CNN. CNN requested comment from Park Police, but has not heard back from the agency. CNN's David Desola contributed to this report.","Publicist says D.C. police car was incorrectly edited into TV show .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor, who asked for a priest ""to read her the last rites"" Sunday, left the hospital Monday afternoon because she ""wants to spend her final days at her home,"" her publicist said. Gabor, 93, is suffering complications from last month's hip-replacement surgery, but she and her husband decided against additional surgery, publicist John Blanchette said. Doctors told her the chances of success from the procedure was 50-50, so she chose to go home instead, Blanchette said. An ambulance carried the actress from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles to her Bel Air, California, home Monday afternoon, he said. ""The doctors did everything they could do,"" her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, said. ""The rest is up to her to whether she recovers or not."" Gabor has been hospitalized for most of the past month since breaking her hip in a fall from bed on July 17. Saturday marked Gabor's 24th wedding anniversary with Von Anhalt, her eighth husband. She was rushed to the hospital from her Bel Air, California, home Friday night, Blanchette said. She underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot that night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, he said. Gabor had just returned home from the hospital on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace the broken hip. She has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","NEW: Zsa Zsa Gabor was released from the hospital Monday .

"(CNN) -- The youngest survivor of a plane crash that killed former Sen. Ted Stevens last week has been released from a hospital in Alaska, according to his family. Willy Phillips Jr., 13, was released from Children's Hospital at Providence Alaska Medical Center and is traveling back to his home state of Maryland, his mother said in a statement Saturday. Willy's father, former Stevens staffer Bill Phillips, was among the five people killed in the crash Monday night near Dillingham, Alaska. In the statement, Janet Phillips thanked first-responders and other medical personnel ""for their heroic efforts the night they spent on the mountain with Willy. Thank you for bringing Willy back."" Phillips also extended her condolences to the other families who lost loved ones in the wreck. ""Bill and our boys shared many Alaska memories,"" Phillips said in the statement. ""They loved Alaska, and as we leave we know Alaska will remain imprinted on our hearts."" In addition to Willy, the survivors of the crash are former NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe and his 19-year-old son, Kevin, and Jim Moorhard of Alexandria, Virginia. Killed in the crash were Bill Phillips Sr., Stevens, 86; pilot Terry Smith, 62, of Eagle River, Alaska; Dana Tindall, 48, of Anchorage, Alaska; and Corey Tindall, 16, of Anchorage, Alaska. A memorial service for the elder Phillips will be held Friday in Potomac, Maryland, according to the statement. Meanwhile, federal investigators continue to probe what caused the plane to crash into a rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Alaska Air National Guard rescuers were hampered by poor weather and terrain -- slogging for hours through rain, fog and wind to reach the site of the plane crash. Autopsies on the five victims found the deaths were the result of blunt force trauma, Greg Wilkinson, an official at the medical examiner's office, said Friday. He said the state medical examiner, Dr. Katherine Raven, found the injuries to be consistent with this type of crash. Raven also found that the injuries were not survivable, he said. A funeral for Stevens, who served in the U.S. Senate for 40 years, will be held Wednesday at the Anchorage Baptist Temple in Anchorage.","Willy Phillips Jr. was among four survivors of the crash .

"Washington (CNN) -- By wading into the issue of an Islamic center and mosque near ground zero, President Barack Obama provided Republicans with an emotion-ridden attack vehicle while diverting attention from campaign themes of fellow Democrats. A senior Republican strategist told CNN that GOP candidates are being encouraged to talk about the issue as much as possible. In Florida, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott launched a statewide television ad Monday criticizing Obama for backing the right of Muslims to build an Islamic center and mosque two blocks from where the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks killed more than 2,700 people. ""Barack Obama says building a mosque at ground zero is about tolerance,"" Scott says in the ad, looking directly into the camera. ""He's wrong. It's about truth."" The ""truth,"" Scott claims, is this: ""Muslim fanatics murdered thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11, just yards from the proposed mosque."" ""The fight against terrorism isn't over,"" Scott concludes. ""Mr. President, ground zero is the wrong place for a mosque."" Meanwhile, a House Democratic leadership aide said the issue was dominating the political conversation when Democrats need to stress campaign themes such as economic recovery and saving social security. ""We understand why the president would want to talk about this issue, but the timing couldn't have been any worse,"" the House Democratic leadership aide told CNN. Despite the concerns of Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada on Monday came out against building the Islamic center and mosque. ""The First Amendment protects freedom of religion. Sen. Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built some place else,"" said a statement issued by Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley. Reid is involved in a tough re-election campaign against conservative Republican Sharron Angle. The statement on the ground zero issue also called for Republicans to back a Democratic bill that would provide health care aid and compensation for firefighters, police officers and other first responders to the 9/11 attacks. For its part, the White House sought to tamp down the discussion Monday. Speaking to reporters, White House spokesman Bill Burton sidestepped a question on Republican strategy and tried to declare the debate over. ""The president didn't do this because of the politics,"" Burton said, adding: ""I think that it's a debate that was had and we've weighed in."" On Sunday, the topic dominated morning talk shows, with Republicans calling Obama insensitive for supporting the right of Muslims to build the Islamic center so close to ground zero. Some predicted political repercussions for Democrats in November's congressional election, even though they agreed with Obama that freedom of religion is a vital part of American democracy. ""The Muslims have, as everyone else does, the right to practice their religion and they have the right to construct a mosque at ground zero if they wish,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""What I'm saying, though, is they should listen to public opinion, they should listen to the deep wounds and anguish this is causing to so many good people."" Republican strategist Ed Rollins, a senior political contributor to CNN, summed up the GOP perspective. ""Intellectually, the president may be right, but this is an emotional issue, and people who lost kids, brothers, sisters, fathers, what have you, do not want that mosque in New York, and it's going to be a big, big issue for Democrats across this country,"" Rollins said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" On the same program, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine challenged the Republican logic. ""You know, we see an awful lot of Republicans going out and saying we've got to respect the Constitution, and that means we have to respect it,"" Kaine said. ""We can't tarnish people's First Amendment rights."" Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania said on the CBS program that the Islamic center issue shouldn't have political resonance. ""I can't imagine that any American -- given the challenges facing this country -- is going to vote based on what he said about the mosque,"" Rendell said of the November election. ""The mosque is an unfortunate situation, but we do have a right to practice our religion freely wherever we choose. Rights are not subject to the popular vote or majority vote."" In his speech at a White House dinner Friday marking the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Obama said Muslims ""have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country."" ""That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances,"" the president added. The next day, Obama told CNN Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry that he was ""not commenting on the wisdom"" of the project, just the broader principle that the government should treat ""everyone equal, regardless"" of religion. His comments were considered by some to backtrack from what he said at the dinner, prompting a White House spokesman to further clarify the president's remarks later Saturday. Both the topic and Obama'sneed to clarify his initial remarks evoked criticism from Republicans. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told ""FOX News Sunday"" that Obama's stance demonstrated how ""Washington, the White House, the administration, the president himself seems to be disconnected from the mainstream of America."" ""This is sort of the dichotomy that people sense, that they're being lectured to -- not listened to -- and I think that's the reason why a lot of people are very upset with Washington,"" Cornyn said. On the CNN program, King said Obama's lack of clarity further muddied the issue. ""If the president was going to get into this, he should have been much more clear, much more precise, and you can't be changing your position from day to day on an issue which does go to our Constitution, and it also goes to extreme sensitivity,"" King said. Democrats responded that critics fail to distinguish between the al Qaeda terrorists who carried out the 9/11 attacks and the Islam religion, which includes peaceful adherents all over the world, including the United States. ""It is only insensitive if you regard Islam as the culprit as opposed to al Qaeda as the culprit,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, said on the CNN program. ""We were not attacked by all Muslims. .... There were Muslims killed there. There were Muslims who ran in as first responders to help."" The issue was one of personal rights, not political popularity, Nadler said, adding: ""We do not put the Bill of Rights, we do not put the religious freedom to a vote."" The House Democratic leadership aide lamented that the topic was getting so much attention. ""We were supposed to be talking about Social Security in this coming week,"" the aide said, referring to Democratic criticism of Republican calls to privatize the government-run pension program. ""This is a really good issue for us. And instead, we're talking about the mosque."" Obama's remarks Friday drew praise from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who announced his support for the Islamic center last week. Bloomberg compared Obama's speech to a letter former President George Washington wrote more than two centuries ago in support of a Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode Island. In the speech, Obama called the 9/11 attacks ""a deeply traumatic event for our country."" ""The pain and suffering experienced by those who lost loved ones is unimaginable,"" Obama continued. ""So I understand the emotions that this issue engenders. Ground zero is, indeed, hallowed ground."" The Islamic center's leaders say they plan to build the $100 million, 13-story facility called Cordoba House two blocks from the site of the 9/11 attacks. The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, describes the project as an ""Islamic community center"" that would include a 500-seat performing arts center, a lecture hall, a swimming pool, a gym, a culinary school, a restaurant and a prayer space for Muslims. Nearly 70 percent of Americans oppose the plan, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation Poll released Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean says he has submitted the necessary paperwork to run for president of Haiti, a country he left when he was a child. Jean made the anticipated announcement Thursday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" The singer traveled to Haiti to submit the paperwork. Jean was one of the first, and most visible, celebrities to offer aid after a devastating earthquake hit Haiti in January. He has also been an outspoken proponent of the nation through his Yele Haiti Foundation, which has come under scrutiny for how it spends its money. ""Yes, it's my first time announcing it live -- that today I went in, and I signed, and I am running to be the president of Haiti,"" said Jean, in his first television interview about his decision to run. Whoever is elected in November, the new president will face the monumental task of rebuilding the country that was ravaged by a January 12 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people, destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable. Whoever steps in will also oversee the billions of dollars in international aid promised to the country since the quake. ""Now that our country has toppled, it's a chance to rebuild from the bottom on up,"" Jean said, adding he will be the voice of Haiti's youth. Jean's announcement quickly became a top topic on the internet, with many debating whether the music star best known for rapping, playing the guitar and dancing, could actually lead a country. One outspoken critic was actor Sean Penn, who has lived in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for months to help manage 50,000 displaced Haitians living in a camp. Penn said he questioned Jean's motives. ""What the Haitian people need now is a leader who is genuinely willing to sacrifice,"" Penn said. ""I haven't seen or heard anything of him in these last six months that I've been in Haiti. I think he's an important voice. I hope he doesn't sacrifice that voice by taking the eye off the very devastating realities on the ground."" Penn mentioned past allegations that Jean mishandled funds from his nonprofit organization Yele Haiti and used some of the money donated for Haitians. ""He claims he didn't do it. That has to be looked into it,"" Penn said. ""I've been there. I know what $400,000 could do for these people's lives."" At the time, Jean tearfully denied the allegations that he misappropriated funds from his Yele Haiti charity and experts on nonprofits said they couldn't find serious wrongdoing. iReporter: Jean made 'several key mistakes' Jean shot to fame in the mid-1990s as a member of the Fugees, a U.S.-based hip-hop and reggae group. He now performs as a solo artist. Jean was born in Haiti, and moved to the United States as a young boy. He recently resigned as chairman of the Yele Haiti Foundation. Jean, dressed in a gray suit and a red-, black- and white-striped tie, stressed the need for Haiti to improve education, as well as its agriculture, security and health care. He also said job creation would be a central part of his campaign going forward.","NEW: Sean Penn criticizes Jean's decision .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge has denied a request to move the trial of Brian David Mitchell, who is accused of kidnapping Elizabeth Smart in 2002, but may revisit the issue depending on the results of potential juror questionnaires. Mitchell's defense attorneys had argued that he should receive a trial outside the state of Utah because publicity in the case has prejudiced the pool of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial. They cited Mitchell's constitutional rights as well as a federal rule of criminal procedure. But U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball ruled Monday that ""this is not one of the extreme cases where a change of venue based on presumed prejudice is constitutionally required."" And while he ""is not satisfied that so great a prejudice exists in this district that defendant cannot receive a fair and impartial trial,"" the judge said concerns over seating an impartial jury could be valid. ""Due to the high-profile nature of this case ... the court undoubtedly has concerns regarding the appropriateness of holding (the) defendant's trial in this district,"" Kimball wrote. ""But the court believes that its concerns may be effectively addressed and answered through the use of the juror questionnaire that the court and parties plan to employ prior to the actual voir dire (jury selection)."" Kimball said he would reserve the ruling on that issue until after the questionnaire responses have been reviewed. Mitchell, 56, is scheduled to stand trial November 1 on charges of kidnapping then-14-year-old Smart in June 2002 and transporting her across state lines for improper purposes. He is accused of snatching Smart at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home. She was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who called himself ""Emmanuel,"" had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor, and in May was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, she has agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband. She also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap Smart's cousin a month after Smart's disappearance. Barzee was given a sentence of one to 15 years to be served concurrently with her federal sentence, and given credit for the seven years she has already spent in custody. Smart, now 22, testified in October as part of Mitchell's competency hearing that after kidnapping her, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her. She testified she was repeatedly assaulted during her months in captivity. While the case garnered international attention, Kimball noted in his ruling that more than eight years have passed since the kidnapping and seven years since Mitchell's arrest. While there was extensive media coverage at the time, the judge said the coverage has fallen off in recent years to stories about the criminal cases against Barzee and Mitchell, and that the coverage has been even-handed. ""The media has undoubtedly been interested in covering the proceedings in this case, but the court has not sensed any kind of 'carnival atmosphere,'"" Kimball wrote. And he pointed out that the jury pool will not come only from Salt Lake City or Salt Lake County, but the entire state of Utah, which has a population of 2.8 million people. ""This is not a case where there is a heightened risk of prejudice in a small community,"" Kimball said. He dismissed defense concerns about the large number of volunteers who searched for Smart after her disappearance, saying such volunteers could be easily weeded out and a potential juror would not necessarily be influenced even if they knew someone who had participated. ""Even though defendant's main defense at trial will be an insanity defense, defendant has not demonstrated any media prejudice in this regard,"" the judge wrote. ""In fact, reports referring to defendant's homeless lifestyle, his grandiose religious beliefs and his disruptive singing in court are likely more favorable than unfavorable to his insanity defense."" Defense attorneys presented an expert survey that showed 92 percent of Utah residents believed Mitchell to be probably or definitely guilty and that 77 percent said they had read, seen, or heard that Mitchell had been found competent to stand trial. But Kimball questioned those results, saying the queries to respondents were in some cases leading and failed to include ""meaningful details.""","Brian David Mitchell's attorneys say the trial should be moved .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Masters -- April 9-12, 2009 . 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson puts the green jacket on 2008 winner Trevor Immelman. While The Open Championship at St Andrews, Scotland may rival it for history, few would argue that the U.S. Masters tournament is unrivalled in terms of beauty and exclusivity. Played at the prestigious Augusta National Golf club in the city of Augusta, Georgia, the first ""major"" of the golfing year is a strictly invitational event controlled by the club itself. The top 50 golfers in the official world rankings are all guaranteed an invite. The dramatic azalea-draped course -- the brainchild of golfing great Bobby Jones -- provides a tough test for the world's elite golfers, particularly since it has been lengthened or ""Tiger-proofed"" in recent years. However the relatively short 12th hole, named Golden Bell, is arguably the most challenging. Jack Nicklaus once called it ""the hardest tournament hole in golf,"" due to the fact that its perilously narrow green is protected in front by Rae's Creek, with two sand traps behind it. Misjudge the wind or get your club selection wrong and the ball will most likely end up in the water. Since Horton Smith won the inaugural Masters title in 1934, the tournament has become as famous for its traditions as it has for the quality of golf on show. Winners are presented with a green jacket by the defending champion -- which they are obliged to return to the clubhouse the following year. Nicklaus, nicknamed the ""Golden Bear,"" became the first golfer to successfully defend his green jacket. He also holds the record for the most titles won at Augusta with six -- his last coming in 1986 at the age of 46. American players currently dominate the competition, following a period in the 1980s and 1990s which saw European players, including Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo, win 10 titles in 17 years. Current world number one Tiger Woods has won four times at Augusta since 1997, while compatriot and rival for top spot, Phil Mickelson, won in 2004 and 2006. South Africa's Trevor Immelman is the current owner of the coveted green jacket.  2008 season in pictures Â» . U.S. Open - June 15-21, 2009 . Tiger Woods and his caddie walk up to the 18th green on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park in 2002. The second of the four major tournaments, the U.S. Open is hosted by the United States Golf Association (USGA). Since its inaugural event in 1895 at the Newport Golf and Country Club, the event has been staged at a number of different courses. What's your favorite tournament? It wasn't until 1913 that the U.S. Open championship really caught the imagination when a young American amateur, Francis Ouimet, stunned the golf world by defeating famous English professionals, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, in a playoff. The format of the tournament has changed several times. The USGA extended the championship to 72 holes in 1898, with 36 holes played on each of two days. In 1926, the format was changed to 18 holes played each of two days, then 36 holes on the third day. In 1965, the present format of four 18-hole daily rounds was implemented for the first time. Over the years, much has been made of the way U.S. Open courses have been set up, with incredibly tough pin positions and rough thick enough to require a compass to navigate through. ""Sometimes the players feel [the USGA] has gotten a little close to the edge on some holes,"" defending champion Retief Goosen told the BBC at Pinehurst, North Carolina in 2005. Two years later, when Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania hosted the tournament, World Golf.com quoted Tiger Woods as saying ""a 10-handicapper didn't stand a chance at breaking 100"" on a course that boasts over 200 deep bunkers. Bobby Jones, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Willie Anderson and Hale Irwin have all triumphed at the U.S. Open on four occasions, while Woods, who won last year's event at Torrey Pines following a dramatic playoff victory over Rocco Mediate, counts three so far among his haul of 14 major titles. The U.S. Open is the only major that requires participants to play-off over 18 holes. This year's event at Bethpage State Park's Black Course in Farmingdale, New York should be familiar to Woods, as he won here in 2002. At 7,214-yards, the municipally-owned Bethpage was the longest U.S. Open course in history. The aptly-named Black Course even carries a warning sign about its difficulty on the first tee. In 2002, American Hale Irwin missed the cut for only the sixth time in 33 Open starts after two torrid rounds of 82 and 81. ""They can go out and write a new book and title it, 'Massacre at ... wherever the heck we are,"" U.S. Open.com quoted him as saying. It remains to be seen whether the recently-injured Tiger can tame the course once again.  Watch more about Woods' comeback Â» . The Open Championship -- July 16-19, 2009 . Padraig Harrington (right) and Greg Norman line up putts during the 2008 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale. Organized by the R&A, which takes its name from Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, Scotland, The (British) Open Championship is the oldest of the four major tournaments. It is also the only one held outside of the United States. First held in October, 1860, The Open was mostly played in Scotland during its early years. Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire was the birthplace of the event, which saw just eight players compete in its inaugural year. A year later the tournament was declared open to the whole world and the event has been known simply as ""The Open"" ever since. Since the early days, the R&A has established a rota of British seaside ""links"" courses to host the event. The major difference between a links course and a parkland course -- such as Augusta -- is that it is far less manufactured. Links courses are constructed out of the sandy, windswept coastal terrain, with few ""man-made"" additions. Players are faced with thick rough, narrow undulating fairways that snake around dunes, and lightening quick greens. There are far fewer trees and water hazards. When the wind gusts these courses demand the highest level of skill and imagination. This year's tournament will be held on the famous Ailsa course at Turnberry on the west coast of Scotland. With its dramatic views and elevated cliff-top holes, the 7,200 yard course previously hosted The Open in 1977, 1986, 1994. The winning aggregate scores in 1977 and 1994 rank among the lowest recorded in Open history, largely because the wind wasn't blowing as it can. Current Open champion Padraig Harrington will arrive at Turnberry looking to win the tournament for the third time in as many years. At Carnoustie in 2007, Harrington became the first Irishman to win The Open since Fred Daly in 1947. He defended his title the following year at Royal Birkdale, finishing four strokes ahead of England's Ian Poulter. Harrington has a long way to go before matching the great Harry Vardon's record of six Open victories between 1896 and 1914. Surprisingly, U.S. golfers -- more used to parkland courses -- have enjoyed great success in the competition in recent years, with 10 wins in 12 years. Tiger Woods, who missed out through injury last year, lifted the Claret Jug in 2000, 2005 and 2006. U.S. PGA Championship -- August 10-16, 2009 . Harrington pumps his fist as he sinks a putt to win the 2008 U.S. PGA Championship at Oakland Hills. The final major of the year, The PGA Championship is organized by the Professional Golfers Association of America (PGA of America) and is also held at a different course each year. The brainchild of New York salesman Rodman Wannamaker, the first PGA Championship was held at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York in 1916 -- the same year the PGA of America was founded. The winners' trophy is named after him. The competition, which was only switched from a matchplay to a strokeplay format in 1958, does not allow amateurs to compete. It always attracts a world class field, in addition to a number of ordinary club professionals in the United States who can qualify through a national tournament. This year's tournament will be held at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, the scene of Rich Beem's defeat of a charging Tiger Woods in 2002. Beem, an unknown club professional who also sold car stereos, held off Woods by recording birdies in his final four holes for a 68 that gave him victory by just one shot. The 7,149-yard course is ranked among the top courses in the United States, according to the PGA. Its signature 16th hole features a wide open fairway that narrows into a long peninsula featuring an elevated green protected by Lake Hazeltine. This year Padraig Harrington will attempt to defend the trophy, a year after he pulled off a dramatic victory over Spain's Sergio Garcia at Oakland Hills. If he succeeds he will become only the second man -- after Tiger Woods -- to be back-to-back PGA Champion. However, both men lag behind Jack Nicklaus, who won a record-equaling fifth U.S.PGA title in 1980 at Oak Hill, Rochester -- the hometown of Walter Hagen, the player whose record Nicklaus tied.","U.S. Masters is always held at prestigious Augusta National, Georgia, U.S.

"(CNN) -- It was an odd sight in Ethiopia's capital this week: a standing ovation for Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the man whom Ethiopian forces had removed from power in neighboring Somalia two years ago. Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Somalia's new president, answers questions at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa. He once led the Islamic Courts Union, which ruled much of Somalia in 2006 before it was routed by the Ethiopians. Now, Ahmed is the leader of Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government -- and two days after his election to the post of president, he was welcomed with open arms at an African Union summit in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. Two years after the invasion and the guerrilla war it provoked, Somalia has in some ways come full circle. Islamist militias control the country's capital and other key cities; the transitional government is trying to establish a foothold from outside the country; and Ahmed -- commonly known as ""Sheikh Sharif"" -- is in a position of power. But several analysts who have studied the region say the new government is in a much stronger position to establish itself inside Somalia and restore order to a country that has been mired in chaos for the past two decades. ""The ascendancy of Sheikh Sharif provides an opportunity to create an inclusive coalition governing from the center outwards,"" said John Prendergast, co-chairman of the Enough Project, who studies the Horn of Africa for the Center for American Progress think tank. The transitional government is currently stranded in Djibouti, unable to return to Somalia after its base in Baidoa was seized last week by Al-Shabaab, a radical Islamist militia with ties to al Qaeda. Ahmed now stands at a crossroads between quelling the militia, which once was aligned with the ICU, and including more moderates in his future government, Prendergast said. ""The fulcrum for change is in the hands of Sheikh Sharif's government,"" he said. ""If he is able to put together an inclusive government -- even if it's only on paper, even if it's only in Djibouti -- I think it will quickly defuse any fervor of support for Shabaab.""  See a list of Somalia's key players Â» . Rise of Al-Shabaab . Al-Shabaab fighters took control of Baidoa hours after the remaining Ethiopian forces withdrew under a June 2008 cease-fire deal. Rashid Abdi, a Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, said the loss of Baidoa is ""a clear indication that the transitional federal government has lost any grip -- whatever grip it had -- in Somalia."" But Prendergast said the radical Islamist militia will most likely lose support among Somalis now that its ""rallying cry"" of getting the Ethiopian forces out of Somalia is gone. ""What the Islamists did was, they wrapped themselves up in the mantle of Somali nationalism and, for the last two years, they have hitched their star to throwing the Ethiopians out,"" he said. Prendergast predicted that Al-Shabaab fighters ""will sustain themselves for awhile and temporarily expand, but I don't envision it to be a long-term prospect at all."" Last year, the United States put Al-Shabaab -- which means ""The Youth"" -- on its list of terrorist groups. Analysts say Al-Shabaab models itself after the Taliban's puritanical Islamic rule.  See a timeline of recent events in Somalia Â» . Stig Jarle Hansen, a Nairobi, Kenya-based expert on Somalia for the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, said Al-Shabaab fighters have been trained in Afghanistan, and the group has ""clear connections"" to al Qaeda. There has been evidence that the group has extended its reach into the United States, as well. The FBI is investigating what appears to be a massive recruitment effort by Al-Shabaab in the United States' Somali communities, particularly in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where more than a dozen young men of Somali descent have gone missing in recent months. One member of Minneapolis' Somali community, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, blew himself up in an apparent suicide bombing in northern Somalia in October. Also, hours before U.S. President Barack Obama took the oath of office in January, the FBI was warned of a possible terrorist attack by Al-Shabaab that was timed to coincide with his inauguration. Prendergast said he expects Al-Shabaab's overseas ties to dry up now that its ""clarion call"" against Ethiopian forces is no longer valid. ""Now that that fight is over, I don't see that money continuing, and I don't see the recruitment from Somalis like places from Minneapolis to continue successfully,"" he said. And Ken Menkhaus, a Davidson College professor and former adviser to U.N. missions in Somalia in the 1990s, said the militia's efforts to govern the territory it holds in southern Somalia has had mixed results, alienating many Somalis by imposing hardline Islamic law. Al-Shabaab now has to justify its continued presence ""on the basis of what it's for -- and what it's for is not very popular among Somalis,"" Menkhaus said. The group is fraught with internal divisions and has already clashed with other militias over control of key neighborhoods in Mogadishu, he said. But if Al-Shabaab did manage to establish a government, there would be a ""genuine fear"" that al Qaeda could try to gain a foothold there. ""It would guarantee proxy wars and conflicts between Somalis and non-Somalis that would just perpetuate this conflict,"" Menkhaus said. Military intervention in Somalia? The United States has conducted periodic airstrikes against Islamist leaders since 2006 and has long viewed Somalia as a possible haven for al Qaeda. But military intervention would not only be unpopular, it would only empower Al-Shabaab by handing it back its ""raison d'etre,"" Prendergast said. ""You don't immediately confront a group like this -- they are at their high point,"" he said. ""You fight it politically and draw support slowly and patiently ... for clans and organizations in Somalia that don't really want them there. ""Area by area, they'll kick them out, unless they make the mistake of sending U.N. troops."" Susan Rice, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told U.S. senators during her confirmation hearing that the situation in Somalia ""has the potential to pose a serious and direct threat to our own national security."" But she also expressed skepticism about the wisdom of sending in a U.N. peacekeeping mission to replace an existing African Union force, calling instead for more efforts by Somalia's neighbors and the international community to promote national reconciliation. J. Anthony Holmes, director of the Africa program for the Council on Foreign Relations, said there is ""little appetite on the ground for sustained engagement"" in Somalia. But because of its clan-based society, it is unlikely the country would emerge as ""a breeding ground for terrorism,"" he said. Holmes said U.S. policy should focus more on longer-term issues -- such as addressing humanitarian and economic issues in the impoverished Horn of Africa country, where years of civil war and near-anarchy have left 1 million people displaced and 3 million needing food aid. The U.S. intervention in Somalia in the 1990s, in which Somali militiamen killed 18 American service members during a failed attempt to capture a Mogadishu warlord, had a chilling effect on U.S. policy toward Africa. Author and policy-maker Jared Cohen writes in his book, ""One Hundred Days of Silence: America and the Rwanda Genocide"" that the ""catastrophe in Somalia was the catalyst for this unspoken decision not to intervene in places like Rwanda."" As the new Obama administration gets its Africa policy in place, Washington is in a good position to exert some leverage in Somalia, Prendergast said. Previous U.S. counterterrorism efforts worked ""at cross-purposes"" with efforts to promote long-term stability and provide humanitarian aid, according to Menkhaus. He recommended that Somali leaders be given room to either marginalize or co-opt the opposition on their own. ""I personally think that they will, if left to their own devices,"" Menkhaus said. ""But Somalis are never left to their own devices."" CNN's David McKenzie and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Moderate Islamist is new leader of war-torn Somalia .

"(EW.com) -- After various Websites noted a curious surge in votes Tuesday for a contestant in Oprah Winfrey's ""Your OWN Show"" contest, OWN, the television network Winfrey will launch in January, confirms to EW it is investigating. The online contest is really a search for contestants for an OWN reality series in which competitors will then vie for their own show on the network. Until yesterday, Zach Anner, a witty wheelchair-bound Texan who explains in his video that he has cerebral palsy (""the sexiest of the palsies"") and pitches ""a travel show for people who never thought they could travel,"" held a commanding lead. But in the afternoon, contestant Dr. Phyllis -- who proposes a reality show on teachers because the drama is in the classroom, rather convincingly -- took the top spot by amassing votes at a rate that spurred some techno-savvy readers into sleuth mode. Geekosystem has a detailed breakdown of the various claims (complete with graphs) among them that for at least a few hours, the source code for Phyllis' ""Vote"" button differed from that of all the other contestants and that as quickly as her vote-per-minute average rose it dropped later that day (from 1,923 votes a minute to 3). Contacted by EW, a spokesperson for OWN issued the following statement: ""The online voting rules for the 'Your OWN Show' video submission competition were carefully crafted to be fair to everyone. Any allegations of impropriety will be investigated and the appropriate actions taken to keep the process unbiased."" (As of 5:15 p.m. ET Wednesday, Anner was back in the lead, by a margin of more than 400,000 votes; Dr. Phyllis could not be reached for comment.) While some conspiracy theorists have gone as far as to suggest that Winfrey could be rigging the competition against Anner, he has not jumped to that conclusion: ""I sincerely doubt that Oprah would do anything like that,"" he says in a statement to EW. ""She's probably too busy building schools and helping children to even notice someone like me. I'm grateful for everyone's continued support and to Oprah for giving me this opportunity.

"(CNN)  -- Argentina's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday it is unconstitutional to punish an adult for private use of marijuana as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. A recent poll showed 29 percent of Americans believe the best way to deal with marijuana is to legalize it. The unanimous ruling makes Argentina the second Latin American country in the past four days to allow personal use of a formerly illegal drug. The case in question involved five young men who were arrested for having a few marijuana cigarettes in their pockets. Supreme Court Justice Carlos Fayt, who at one time supported laws that make personal use of marijuana illegal, told the state-run Telam news agency that ""reality"" changed his mind. Argentina's action came amid growing momentum in Latin America toward decriminalization of possessing small amounts of certain drugs. Mexico enacted a law Friday that decriminalizes possessing low quantities of most drugs, including marijuana, heroin, cocaine and LSD. Earlier this year, a Brazilian appeals court ruled that possession of drugs for personal use is not illegal. Analysts see the shift in attitude as recognition that current methods in the war on drugs are not working. ""It seems quite clear that drug policy based primarily on interdiction and enforcement has failed,"" said Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. ""Therefore, it's natural for people to stand back and ask, 'Is there a better way?' "" Pastor noted that some recent research has shown that handling drug use as a health challenge and focusing on treatment may be more efficient. ""What Argentina and Mexico are doing in many ways is blazing a new path,"" Pastor said. Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute in Washington, sees a trend at work. ""It's all part of a harm-reduction approach,"" Hakim said, noting that policymakers are shifting away from getting rid of drugs and toward figuring out how to reduce harm to users and society. Mexico has been considering decriminalization for several years, particularly under the administration of former President Vicente Fox, who held office from 2000-2006. But efforts by the Mexican congress toward decriminalization met with strong resistance from the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush. ""Mexico tried it under Fox and the U.S. got so snippety that they had to back down,"" Hakim said. President Obama's inauguration in January may have changed the calculus, analysts said. The Mexican congress passed the measure in April and President Felipe Calderon quietly signed it into law. In a visit to the United States, Fox said in May a new approach is needed. ""I believe it's time to open the debate over legalizing drugs,"" he told CNN. ""It must be done in conjunction with the United States, but it is time to open the debate."" Earlier this year, Fox's predecessor and two other former leaders of Latin American nations also called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in strategy in the war on drugs. The three ex-presidents were members of the 17-nation Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy, which issued its recommendations in February after studying the issue for a year. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference in which the commission's recommendations were presented. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because ""you have to start somewhere."" Fox's predecessor, Ernesto Zedillo, was president of Mexico from 1994 to 2000. Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994. And Cardoso led Brazil from 1995 to 2002. In his swing through the United States, Fox said any change in drug laws must be accompanied by an education campaign in schools and homes. And because the United States is a large consumer of marijuana that comes from Latin America, any steps toward legalization must be supported in Washington, he said. Gaviria had said in February that the time was right to start a debate on the subject because of the new administration in Washington. ""In many states in the United States, as is the case in California, they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes. And in Washington there's some consensus that the current policy is failing,"" Gaviria said. The Inter-American Dialogue's Hakim said one recent poll showed that 29 percent of Americans think the best way to deal with marijuana is to legalize it. Pastor, the former Carter official, wondered whether anyone in Washington is paying attention. ""The question,"" he said Tuesday, ""is whether the United States will be open to this new path.""","NEW: Argentina court: It's unconstitutional to punish adult for private use of marijuana .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)  -- America's top diplomat to Kenya has announced that the United States has suspended a $7 million ""capacity building"" program for the country's Ministry of Education, citing corruption. ""The United States shares the deep concern of Kenya's development partners and the Kenyan people regarding the continuous revelations of large-scale corruption,"" Ambassador Michael Ranneberger said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Nairobi, Kenya. The announcement comes after allegations of major corruption in the country's much-praised free schooling campaign for primary education. ""Those culpable for the fraud should not merely be sacked, they should be prosecuted and put behind bars,"" said the U.S. ambassador.

"(CNN) -- A judge has ordered an independent inquiry into whether war-crimes prosecutors at The Hague may have intimidated and/or pressured witnesses testifying in the continuing trial of a Serbian politician accused of war crimes. Presiding Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti announced he would appoint an amicus curiae (friend of the court) to look into the charges, according to documents posted on the website of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The U.N. court deals with war crimes that occurred during the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Antonetti ordered the inquiry on June 29, but it received scant attention until Wednesday, when a reporter asked about it at The Hague. The inquiry cites former Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte as well as prosecutors Hildegard Urtz-Retzlaff and Daniel Saxon. Del Ponte stepped down from the job at the end of 2007 and is now Switzerland's ambassador to Argentina. ""She's only mentioned because she's the former head of the office, but the allegations are aimed at the investigators and lawyers who worked for her,"" said Frederick Swinnen, special assistant to the current prosecutor at The Hague, in a telephone interview Wednesday with CNN. A man who answered the telephone at the Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires said Del Ponte was on vacation and not available. The allegations concern testimony in the continuing trial of Vojislav Seselj, a former political ally of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague. Seselj first made similar complaints three years ago, Swinnen said. He noted that the defendant has himself been convicted for contempt of court. The friend of the court has not yet been appointed, he said Wednesday. ""There are several candidates; it's still at a preliminary stage,"" he said, adding that he did not expect the inquiry to find any malfeasance. ""Our view is our staff has acted in a professional way and within the rules,"" he said. ""Once an amicus curiae is appointed, we will work with him and assist him in his task."" The inquiry was initiated after a number of witnesses complained ""that they had been allegedly intimidated or pressured"" by prosecutors, said Swinnen. ""The chamber obviously took these allegations very seriously and decided that it would be wrong to leave any space for doubt arising either on the protection of the rights of the accused or on the investigation techniques by members of OTP [Office of the Prosecutor],"" said Christian Chartier, acting spokesman for registry and chambers, in a statement on the court's website. The friend of the court is to report back to the chamber within six months whether there are sufficient grounds to start contempt proceedings against investigators for the prosecution, he said. One witness said he and his family ""were subjected to tremendous pressure by the prosecution,"" including 30 to 50 telephone calls per say from the prosecution, the judge wrote. Another said prosecutors told him that, ""if he testified, after that he could go to America, that he would get a good salary and would get money."" Complaining statements also ""mention sleep deprivation during interviews, psychological pressuring, an instance of blackmail (the investigators offered relocation in exchange for the testimony they hoped to obtain), threats (one, for example, about preparing an indictment against a witness if he refused to testify), or even illegal payments of money,"" the judge wrote. The prosecution said it ""considers these allegations to be utterly devoid of factual basis.""","Judge has ordered a ""friend of the court"" to look into the accusations .

"(CNN) -- Clark Dever and Joe Dinardo have always taken things to the extreme. Joe Dinardo, left, and Clark Dever will be spending only 12 hours in each city before going to their next stop. So when JetBlue announced a monthlong all-you-can-jet pass for $599, it was as if the airline had practically issued them a challenge. ""We decided to come up with the most extreme length you could take it and have the most fun without being crazy,"" Dinardo told CNN. ""We've always pushed each other to be more outrageous, so this is just taking that to another level."" Dever and Dinardo, friends since their freshman year of college at SUNY Buffalo, will be crisscrossing the country, spending only 12 hours in each city before heading back to the airport and jetting to their next destination. The deal allows passengers unlimited travel to all cities JetBlue services from September 8 to October 8 for $599. Dever, who was recently saving up money to be a professional photographer, quit his job, and Dinardo decided to use all of his accumulated vacation time from his job to take the trip. They plan to make the most of the deal, hitting at least 29 cities in the 31 days by taking about 49 one-way flights. They'll sleep during their flights, take showers in gyms, and have friends work as runners to swap out bags of clothes when they fly into New York's JFK airport about every three days. They've even worked with some companies to obtain sponsorships. They plan to interview fellow fliers to get the skinny on the best places to go in hopes of taking the ""local's tour"" of a city as opposed to a generic tourist trip for their Web site twelvehoursinacity.com. ""What better way to get a snapshot of the United States,"" Dever said. ""To really capture the unique culture of each city, to meet all of the different people."" And for them, the price is unbeatable. The way they see it, if each flight cost $200, they're taking a $10,000 trip for only $600. Which is exactly why the promotion has received such a great deal of buzz, specifically among social networking platforms. JetBlue suspended the deal two days early, saying they were sold out, though the company declined to specify how many people bought them. Jennifer Milano, who is taking time off from freelance work to take advantage, grabbed a pass right away. She decided that with the buzz on Twitter, she could start organizing a group of fellow all-you-can-jet travelers, calling it the 599club. She created a site where people are sharing their itineraries in an attempt to either travel together, meet up with Twitter followers in their cities or try to couch surf at other people's homes. Some may even meet in California to go skydiving together. Will and Cara Dearman had been planning to move to New York from Austin, Texas, when they heard about the deal. So they decided to pack up their home, bring in the movers and head off for vacation before their big move. Given JetBlue's hub structure, many travelers found a slight hiccup: If they were in the Midwest, they might have to travel all the way back to New York to travel to the West Coast. The couple will be spending a large chunk of their trip in South America and the Caribbean and will be doing video interviews with entrepreneurs around the world for Will Dearman's Web site, TheStrategyBlog.com. For Greg Krause, the pass is a chance to raise money for a charity close to his heart, Â­ an elementary school in Zambia that his parents created for orphaned children in a small village two hours from a main road. Krause plans to go to 24 cities, using about 45 different flights, to have both an enjoyable vacation and hopefully meet people who will donate to the school. He also will be documenting his trip on his Web site, 30daysonjetblue.com. Though Dever and Dinardo may have the most exhausting schedule, they, like many others, think that if nothing else, the trip will be a true adventure. ""No matter what happens, there will certainly be a story that comes out of this trip,"" Dever said. ""For us, the biggest concern will be finding a place to shower. We certainly don't want to be the stinky guys on the plane, especially for that many flights. But either way, its going to be an adventure, a tiring but exciting adventure.""","Deal allows passengers unlimited travel  for a month on JetBlue for $599 .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel's two largest parties each claimed a mandate early Wednesday after exit polls showed a surprise first-place finish by the ruling Kadima party and dramatic gains by its conservative rivals. Kadima's Tzipi Livni won more support than was predicted in the Israeli elections. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni's failure to assemble a ruling coalition for Kadima last year triggered Tuesday's elections. But she told supporters after the vote that the narrow edge Kadima appears to have held over the conservative Likud shows her party is ""the common denominator of Israeli society."" Livni called on Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu ""to respect the choice of Israel's citizens ... and to join a unity government, led by us, that will be based on the large parties in Israel, left and right."" But Netanyahu said the showing by Likud -- which appears to have more than doubled the number of seats it holds in the Knesset -- Israel's parliament -- show voters have rejected Kadima's leadership, and he said conservative parties could form a majority when the results are in. ""With God's help, I shall head the coming government,"" he said. ""I am sure that I can manage to put together a good, broad-based and stable government that will be able to deal with the security crisis and the economic crisis."" ""It's a typical Israeli election in that you might have two winners,"" Israeli political analyst Chemi Shalev told CNN. ""The clear-cut winner, in the sense that she did much better than any expectations, is Tzipi Livni and Kadima. But we have to judge elections by the bottom line, and if it turns out that ... Benjamin Netanyahu will be the the prime minister, he will be judged to have been the winner."" CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman and Israeli political analysts warned that exit polls had been wrong in past elections. The campaign was dominated by the recent war with Palestinian militants in Gaza, which was popular within Israel despite widespread international condemnation. Netanyahu was a harsh critic of Kadima founder Ariel Sharon's 2005 withdrawal of Israeli troops and settlers from Gaza, and his supporters say he has been proven right. Unofficial results gave Kadima a narrow lead over Likud, with the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu in third place and Labor -- Israel's founding party and Kadima's current coalition partner -- in fourth. According to Israeli media, with all precincts reporting, Kadima was on track to win 28 seats in the 120-member Knesset, the same as it currently holds. Likud was forecast to win 27 -- a dramatic jump from its current 12. Yisrael Beiteinu was on track to win 15 seats, up from 11 currently, while Labor appeared to have slid from 18 seats to 13. A fourth-place finish would be an unprecedentedly weak showing for Labor, now led by Defense Minister and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. With those numbers, Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael  Beiteinu, a party even further right-wing than Likud, would be the third largest faction in the legislature. If the numbers hold up and Lieberman's party surpasses Labor, the founding party of the Jewish state, it would be unprecedented. Lieberman, 50, is a polarizing figure whose party has been accused of racism against Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel. But he said early Wednesday that his party ""is not only the key to the next coalition, it will also set the agenda for the next government."" And Likud member Reuven Rivlin, a former Knesset speaker, said voters decided ""to change the ideas of the former government."" ""We have to continue the negotiations with the Palestinians, but under mutuality and under the idea that it is a give and take -- that after the agreement, we will find ourselves at peace,"" Rivlin said. Shalev suggested a Kadima-Likud-Labor coalition is possible -- but it was not clear who would lead it. The next prime minister will have six weeks to form a coalition government. A government needs a controlling majority of 61 in the 120-seat Knesset. Neither Likud nor Kadima is expected to reach even half that figure. Livni took control of Kadima in September, when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stepped down as the party leader amid several corruption investigations. She has been careful not to cast herself as a dove in the election with advertising focused on the military assault in Gaza and tough statements against the Palestinian fundamentalist group Hamas. Netanyahu served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999. He has supported the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and opposed further territorial concessions to end the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Kadima member Machman Shai told CNN that Livni ""was attacked from the right and the left. They said she was not capable for the job -- very chauvinistic. And I think it was all wrong. She is a leader and up to leading Israel in the years to come.""  Early joy at Kadima HQ Â» . ""The majority of the people want a windfall,"" Netanyahu said Tuesday while casting his ballot. ""They want a change of direction to security, honor and hope, and I think they will vote for this today."" About 5.2 million people were eligible to vote, choosing from 33 parties, with polls closing at 10 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). According to the Central Election Committee, 62.5 percent of eligible voters cast ballots -- about 2 percentage points higher than the country's last elections, in 2006.  Will a new leader make any difference? Â» . This year, the election was expected to largely determine which Israeli parties should take credit for the recent war in Gaza. iReport.com: See photos of the scene as voters head to the polls . Despite international condemnation over the high number of Palestinian civilian casualties, it was a popular war in Israel. Domestic support was strong throughout, especially among residents within Palestinian militant rocket range, and it was perceived in Israel as a success. Polls showed that could bode well for Israel's right-wing parties. Defense Minister Ehud Barak, head of the Labor Party, also hoped for a sizable boost from the three-week Gaza war. But it probably will not be enough to lead the government. Before the operation, Labor was tipped to win just eight seats. That doubled in some polls, albeit briefly. A small number of rockets are still falling in southern Israel, and that could play into the hands of Netanyahu. He was not in a position of power during the war, but he sought to capitalize on his opposition to Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, telling voters he warned the move would result in Palestinian militant rockets hitting major cities. At the time he was ridiculed by his political rivals, but his supporters say he was proven right.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Former porn star Jenna Jameson said she wants to get back with Tito Ortiz four days after things got ""tragically out of hand"" and he was arrested on a domestic violence charge. But the couple's reconciliation ""is irrelevant"" to the prosecution of Ortiz since it is the state of California, not Jameson, who filed the charge against the mixed martial artist, a police spokesman said. A restraining order prevents Ortiz and Jameson from reuniting immediately. Ortiz, 35, was arrested at his Huntington Beach, California, home Monday morning when Jameson's father called police as the couple argued. ""By calling the police, my father was trying to defuse a private issue between two people,"" Jameson said in a written statement Friday. Ortiz and his lawyer told reporters later Monday that he was upset because he thought Jameson had relapsed in her rehabilitation from a prescription drug addiction. Jameson, 36, was captured by cameras alternately saying Ortiz was ""the sweetest, most amazing man"" and later saying that he had beaten her. ""Unfortunately, what actually happened has now been dramatically distorted and misinterpreted and remarks that both Tito and I made after the police arrived reflect the state of shock that we were both in,"" Jameson said Friday. Now, she says she wants him back in her life. ""He's a fantastic father and I'm confident we can work through this challenge,"" she said. While Ortiz and his lawyer did not immediately respond to calls for comment, the former Ultimate Fighting champ made it clear Monday night that he wanted her back. Tears rolled down his cheeks as Ortiz listened to his lawyer talk to reporters. ""They have two children together,"" attorney Chip Matthews said.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The rescue and recovery efforts of the Pakistan floods that have killed more than 800 could become more complicated as weather officials predict more monsoon rains starting Monday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department said Sindh, Punjab, Kashmir, eastern parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and eastern parts of Balochistan would receive monsoon rains. Areas along the Indus River would be badly affected due to extremely high flood conditions. The death toll from the flooding has risen to at least 800, the information minister of a northern province said Saturday. The number reflects those killed only in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, previously known as the North West Frontier Province, said spokesman Mian Iftikhar Hussain. Flooding has also been reported in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Twenty-five deaths were recorded there Friday, Hussain said. The United Nations says the number of people affected by the floods has risen to nearly 1 million people, with infrastructure receiving major damage. Rushing water also has washed away thousands of acres of crops, government buildings, businesses, schools, bridges and homes, officials said. The United States will assist in relief efforts by bringing in 50,000 meals, rescue boats and helicopters, 12 pre-fabricated steel bridges and water filtration units, the embassy in Islamabad said. According to Geo TV, 150 people are missing in a northwestern province and 3,700 homes were swept away. Forty-seven bridges in Sawat have been destroyed or damaged. Geo TV also said 3,000 are in a camp in Nowshera and are without enough water and food. Displaced residents are unhappy with the government response, Geo TV said. Trains have also been delayed, frustrating commuters. ""They have made this a joke,"" a commuter told the network. ""There are young children here but there is no water, nor is there any seating, they have taken our ticket money yet after every few minutes they change the train timings. They are playing a game of lies and deceit."" Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik visited Kyhber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday and found tourists and local residents trapped because of the heavy floods, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported. President Asif Ali Zardari said all available resources would be used to help those stranded by the waters, the APP reported. Many of the victims died when floodwaters swept away hundreds of mud houses in parts of Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Tank, according to Bashir Ahmed Bilour, a provincial minister in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Hussain said flooding has cut off the Swat Valley and the districts of Shangla and Peshawar. There is no way to get to these areas by road, he said. The Pakistani Air Force has been helping with rescue efforts, spokesman Tariq Yazdanie said in an interview on Pakistani TV. The recent torrential rains have broken all previous records of rainfall in the country, he said. The United Nations said there is a need for help in providing emergency shelter, food, drinking water and sanitation facilities. Its agencies are geared to help with these issues. The European Commission is providing 30 million euros ($39 million) to help the people affected by the flooding. ""Pakistan has been hit by terrible floods and more rain is forecast. Our thoughts are with those affected by them,"" said Kristalina Georgieva, European commissioner for international Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response. ""I am pleased that our decision to provide new humanitarian funding for the most vulnerable people in Pakistan will also be able to benefit the people, who have suffered from this disaster."" According to a Pentagon official with knowledge of the operations, the U.S. is assisting with the delivery of meals to the affected region. A C-130 carrying 12,000 Halal meals (MREs but tailored for people of Islamic faith) was on its way to Pakistan on Saturday. By Saturday afternoon another 45,000 meals were to be delivered. Officials promised further assistance efforts in the coming days. CNN's Reza Sayah and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Displaced residents are unhappy with government response .

"(CNN)  -- Craigslist will replace its controversial online ""erotic services"" listings with a section where ads are individually checked by Craigslist employees before they are posted, according to Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. Craigslist will replace its ""erotic services"" listings with ads that are screened by the site's employees. The popular classified-ad Web site, which Blumenthal called ""a blatant Internet brothel,"" has been accused by law enforcement officials across the United States of promoting prostitution through its erotic ads. ""Craigslist is heeding our clear call for conscience and common sense, sending a strong signal that Internet sites must police themselves to protect others,"" Blumenthal said. Craigslist representatives met in New York last week with Blumenthal and the attorneys general of Missouri and Illinois, all of whom asked the company to shut down its ""erotic services"" sections in their states. Cook County, Illinois, Sheriff Thomas Dart called Craigslist ""the single largest source of prostitution in the nation."" ""As head of the multistate attorney general task force,"" Blumenthal said, ""I was informed by Craigslist late last night that it will eliminate the 'erotic services' section within seven days, create a new section called 'adult services' and manually review every ad posted there to bar flagrant prostitution and pornography.""  Listen to Blumenthal talk to CNN Radio about the change Â» . ""So far, it looks like we've struck the right balance, and most of the feedback we're getting right now is positive,"" Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster told CNN's ""American Morning."" He said his company does not view the law enforcement community's involvement as pressure. ""We're looking for constructive criticism, and certainly we've been getting plenty of that,"" Buckmaster said. Craigslist executives released a statement Wednesday confirming the change, which it said will take place after current ads expire in seven days. New ads in the ""adult services"" section ""will be opened for postings by legal adult service providers,"" the company said. ""Each posting to this new category will be manually reviewed before appearing on the site, to ensure compliance with Craigslist posting guidelines and terms of use,"" it said. Advertisers will pay a $10 fee for each new ad, it said. Blumenthal said state agencies will keep a close eye on the Web site and others ""to make sure prostitution and pornography do not migrate and move elsewhere."" ""We will be monitoring closely to make sure that this measure is more than a name change from 'erotic' to 'adult' and that the manual blocking is tough and effective to scrub prostitution and pornography,"" he said. ""Our continuing investigation will assure that these steps are substance, not just spin, and that Craigslist really shuts down its open online red-light district."" Craigslist drew attention recently after a 23-year-old medical student was charged in the death of a masseuse in a Boston, Massachusetts, hotel room and in a hotel assault in Rhode Island. Police have said it appeared that the attacker in both cases had responded to the victims' Craigslist ads. The Craigslist statement said ads on its site have been associated with ""far lower rates of violent crime than print classifieds, let alone rates of violent crime pertaining to American society as a whole."" It suggested that the online ads are safer because of verification measures, community monitoring, the electronic trail left by those using the site and Craigslist's cooperation with investigators. In November, Craigslist entered into an agreement with more than 40 attorneys general and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to add safeguards to combat unlawful activity and improve public safety. As part of the reforms, Craigslist agreed to implement credit card verification, assess a fee and require a phone number from people posting ""erotic services.""","NEW: CEO says company ""looking for constructive criticism""

"(CNN) -- Apparently, reality star Snooki is not just too pretty for jail, she is too pretty for court. Nicole Polizzi, also known as Snooki on MTV's reality show ""Jersey Shore,"" did not attend a court hearing in New Jersey on Wednesday. Her lawyer, Ray Raya, appeared on her behalf, to enter a ""not guilty"" plea on a disorderly conduct charge, according to a Seaside Heights Municipal Court spokesman. The 22-year-old was arrested in late July on the beaches of Seaside Heights, New Jersey. She will not serve jail time, but faces potential fines ranging from $250 to $1,000. She is expected to attend her next hearing, set for September 8, the court spokesman said. Polizzi told MTV News that jail is not the place for someone as attractive as she is. ""I'm too pretty to be in jail. I'm a good person. I'm not a criminal and I will never go back there,"" the ""Jersey Shore"" star said. She said she realizes she may have had too many drinks, but that it's nothing to get crazy over. ""I don't know why people take it so seriously,"" Polizzi said. ""I had a couple cocktails, and they just put me in a drunk tank to sober me up."" The arrest of the TV star even caught the attention of Arizona Sen. John McCain. McCain jokingly brought up the arrest during a recent visit to Phoenix radio station KMLE Country 108. ""I have a question for you that I thought about on the way over: Should Snooki go to jail? Or -- a question for our listeners -- is Snooki too good-looking to go to jail?"" McCain asked. ""This has given a whole new meaning to our justice system, and I'm kind of leaning towards Snooki being too good-looking.""","""Jersey Shore"" star did not attend Wednesday's hearing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Prosecutors grilled Sen. Ted Stevens on Monday about whether he accepted gifts as a lawmaker. Sen. Ted Stevens and his daughter Beth Stevens arrive Monday at the federal courthouse. The defense rested its case after prosecutors sparred with the Republican senator, who is charged with breaking Senate ethics rules by failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts and renovations on his home in Alaska. Stevens, the longest-serving Republican senator in history, battled with prosecutor Brenda Morris during his three days on the stand. They tangled over whether a massage chair in Stevens' home was a gift or a loan, with Stevens asserting he had told his friend and neighbor, Bob Persons, he could not accept a gift under Senate rules. ""He said it was a gift, and I said I could not take it,"" Stevens insisted, recalling details of the purchase in 2001. ""But you kept it?"" Morris asked. ""It's still there,"" Stevens replied, acknowledging the chair is at his townhouse in Washington. The prosecution has been trying to show that Stevens failed to disclose about $250,000 worth of goods and services provided for his Alaskan home over the course of about seven years. Senators are required to report gifts on forms that are filed annually. Prosecutors dueled with Stevens over specifics about the chair in an effort to show that he was crafty in his ability to find ways around reporting the gifts or providing full disclosure about them. In his second day on the stand, Stevens testified that he and his wife paid for all the improvements on their Alaska chalet, which was extensively remodeled about eight years ago. He also attempted to address a series of e-mails that prosecutors introduced earlier in the trial. During cross-examination, Stevens stood firm in his denials of wrongdoing through testy exchanges with Morris, who accused him of trying to ""cover your butt"" with a series of e-mails asking about invoices and billing. ""No, my bottom wasn't bare,"" Stevens replied. His defense team responded that former Alaska businessman Bill Allen, who arranged much of the the work on Stevens' home, quashed bills without Stevens' knowledge. Allen has pleaded guilty to trying to bribe a number of Alaska state officials -- not including Stevens -- and was the prosecution's star witness. Stevens is not charged with taking bribes. Stevens, 84, hopes to clear his name by November, in time for voters to decide whether to elect him to a seventh term representing Alaska, as he has done for nearly 40 years. He was the last witness for the defense. Closing arguments are expected Tuesday, with jury deliberations expected to begin Wednesday. CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","Defense rests case after prosecutors cross-examine Stevens .

"(CNN) -- The boy stood out because of the bright blue shirt he was wearing, not for his arms stretched toward the heavens or the look in his eyes that said: I am hungry. All the other boys were desperate, too. Photographer Paula Bronstein looked down at them from the Pakistani military helicopter about to drop food and water. She would never know their names but she would tell their story. Click. click. click. The boy in the blue shirt is one of 20 million Pakistanis suffering in a land washed away by massive monsoon flooding. Aid workers say that media coverage of a disaster helps bring in donations. Bronstein, working for Getty Images, and other photographers are attempting to unveil the unfathomable scope of Pakistan's human misery. Three weeks into the crisis, thousands of homeless packed into makeshift, fly-infested camps. They endured the searing summer heat and the ache of their empty bellies. They wondered, with more rain on the way, when they might see home again. If ever. Some voiced frustration that aid had not reached them. Others were downright angry at their own government for perceived failure in a time of national need. Much of the criticism has been pointed at President Asif Ali Zardari, who was in Europe as the crisis unfolded and was late visiting flood zones. Zardari again left Pakistan Wednesday, arriving in the Russian town of Sochi to participate in a four-nation summit with Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Russia, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan. Zardari's office has defended the president's travels as part of his job and called the criticism ""venomous propaganda of his opponents."" But one thing is clear: Zardari, leader of a country already coping with poverty and violence, will have to deal with far-reaching consequences of the floods. The United Nations has received less than half of the $460 million it needs for relief efforts. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's office said she would announce more aid Thursday on top of the roughly $70 million already pledged by Washington. No one knows exactly why the flow of aid money is failing to keep up with the need, though Bronstein, interviewed Wednesday on CNN, suspected one reason might be the death toll. At just over 1,400, it is low given the scale of the disaster. ""What usually takes people's breath away is the sheer number of people who die,"" she said. ""But this is a different kind of disaster."" It has been evolving and people's suffering increased incrementally along with the water that spread from the mountains in the north to the plains of the south. Aid workers have also said it has been hard to reach people because of continuing rain and damaged or flooded bridges and roads. In villages and towns where they were able to get through, people raced trucks carrying relief. Only the young boys, like the one with the blue shirt, had the energy to keep up, it seemed to Bronstein. From the back of an aid truck all she could see were a mess of tangled arms forced through open windows. Others grabbed onto chunks of ice distributed by a local charity. Another photo showed a woman in a black and pink dupatta (scarf). Her left hand hugged her cheek in despair, her eyes failed to meet the camera's lens. Bronstein snapped a perfect portrait of uncertainty. ""When you are here, you see how little people have,"" Bronstein said. ""The poorest people have been affected."" Even when the rescue choppers land or the boats arrived, many Pakistanis were reluctant to leave home. They depended on the land and their animals to make a living. They already lost their crops. If they left their livestock behind, they would be leaving with nothing. How would they restart life? But it was only from the air, said Bronstein, that she could see what it meant for one-fifth of the country to be underwater. A group of people stood on an island of dry, dusty ground with a handful of ramshackle shelters. They were surrounded by water, water and more water. The helicopter hovered before dropping bags of flour and 10-packs of bottled water. A man on a rooftop thrashed his arms about for attention. No one can afford to be forgotten, to be left behind or left without. Bronstein pointed her camera toward people who have nothing. The world, she felt, needed to see.

"(LifeWire)  -- Misti Guertin was a publicist with a full roster of clients and a growing salary when her husband, Gary, 56, was offered a job managing a luxury resort on a private island in the Caribbean. ""It takes some heartfelt conversations to begin balancing the career scales in a marriage,"" says an expert. ""My career was just beginning to bloom,"" says the Stuart, Florida, resident, ""but we both placed more emphasis on Gary's career."" Misti, 47, was raised to believe that the man's career comes first. So she went, taking a token title as co-manager of the resort. But less than a year after their arrival in 2005, a fire ravaged the resort and Gary's contract was terminated. ""The strain on our relationship was sizable,"" she says. The couple returned to Florida, where Misti went back to work as a publicist and Gary as the general manager of a yacht club and marina. Her income this year, she says, will exceed Gary's. It's common for couples to place more emphasis on the man's career, according to a 2007 study of more than 9,000 married men and women ages 25-59. The researchers, from the University of Iowa and the University of California-Davis, also found that when couples relocate, the husband tends to get a salary boost -- $3,000 on average. But the wife loses $750. ""When couples migrate, they are [typically] doing it for the benefit of the husband's career, and so the wife is what we call the 'trailing spouse,'"" says study author Mary Noonan, associate professor of sociology at the University of Iowa. ""She may have to take a job in the new location that is a less-than-ideal match for her skills [or] qualifications."" Expert: 'Things are moving slowly in the right direction' Why do couples, even today, let the woman's job take a back seat? Blame it on socialization, says Noonan. While it may not be true for every relationship, more often than not, she says, ""men and women are taught to play very different roles within marriage. Women are socialized to play a homemaking role within the family, whereas men are encouraged to focus on their careers and breadwinning.""  See how one dad has taken on child-rearing duties Â» . Daniel Buccino, a psychotherapist and faculty member at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, agrees. ""Until more men are willing to say, 'You know, honey, you shouldn't have to change your name or sacrifice your career, and I'll stay home with our kids and aging parents,' progress will remain glacial,"" he says. ""But things are moving slowly in the right direction."" After Dayna Steele, 48, published her first book in March and began making the media rounds, she found herself dealing with subtle power plays at home. ""I have tried very hard to schedule around my husband's full-time job and keep him posted on my schedule, confirming dates before I book them,"" says Steele, a former radio host living in Seabrook, Texas. ""Then, he started scheduling things over mine without telling me. ""It turned into a battle when I first tried to point out to him what he was doing -- trivializing my new career after promising to support it because he had a 'more important' job."" Steele knows her husband's salary and benefits are important but says her career deserves respect, too. ""We're not quite all the way there, but we're making some progress,"" she says. Steele's husband, Charles Justiz, 55, a NASA research pilot, says he does his best to show he values his wife's career, but it can be challenging, especially with two children. ""We've had some collisions,"" he admits. ""I can't call NASA and say, 'Excuse me, I can't come in because my wife has a book signing.'""  See how CNN journalists juggle careers with motherhood Â» . But they're both working on being more flexible, he says. ""I love my wife, and the old saying is true: 'If Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.'"" 'Balancing career scales' Experts have some tips for couples clashing over a career move: . Trade places. ""It takes some heartfelt conversations to begin balancing the career scales in a marriage,"" says Les Parrott, a clinical psychologist and faculty member at Seattle Pacific University. ""It requires both spouses to be honest with their feelings."" Parrott asks clients to list what's important to them about their careers, assigning each element a value from 1 to 10. After each spouse makes a list, they try to guess how much their partner values each item. ""It's almost always an eye-opener,"" says Parrott. ""It helps them empathize. It helps them trade places. And with that new perspective, they are ready for a more honest and grace-filled exploration of their options together."" Try the ""package deal"" approach. When a couple is considering relocating, Buccino says, one spouse should see what the new company can do for the other. Switch off. Buccino says the fluidity of today's job market gives couples ""opportunities to evaluate and re-evaluate and hopefully switch off between whose career takes priority at various phases along the marital life cycle."" When neither is willing to budge, there's always the long-distance marriage. ""I have seen two-career couples that live in two different cities,"" Buccino says, ""because neither is willing to pass up great career opportunities."" While such an arrangement may be a good interim move, it can take a toll on the relationship. ""Some couples have not made it,"" Buccino says. ""If they're committed to each other and the relationship, and otherwise so busy with work when apart, then it can work. But I'm not sure I'd recommend it as a first choice.""

"(CNN) -- The mother of the man who gunned down eight of his colleagues at a beer distributor in Connecticut earlier this month says her son was ""no monster,"" but a ""gentle spirit"" who had reached his limit after being racially harassed at work. Omar Thornton, 34, called his mother, Lille Holliday, before fatally shooting himself, putting an end to the terrifying shooting spree that left eight people dead at Hartford Distributors in Manchester, Connecticut, on August 3. ""He said, 'I just killed the five most racist people,' and I knew he wasn't playing because he don't talk like that,"" Holliday told CNN's Soledad O'Brien in an interview that aired Tuesday. Holliday said when she looked at her caller ID and saw that the phone call was coming from her son's place of employment, ""I just kind of lost it."" Manchester police have said they have found no evidence of racial discrimination, and the president of Hartford Distributors said Thornton never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination. Instead, the company said it had asked him to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Holliday disputed that statement in the interview, saying, ""I know he reported the [racial] problems because he brought home the papers that they signed."" Thornton's girlfriend, Kristi Hannah, has said Thornton reported seeing drawings of a hangman with a noose around its neck as well as hearing the N-word directed toward him. Holliday said she had few clues as to what Thornton was planning, but noted, ""I could just kind of see slowly he was just getting frustrated and aggravated."" ""He was getting more stressed out and he started to just kind of change,"" Holliday said. ""He started not being so relaxed but I never thought that it would be possible that something like this would happen."" Asked about the how calm Thornton sounded when he placed a 911 call to police after the killings, Holliday said, ""I think that he was at his limit and the calmness is something that he's always been. I've never really seen him enraged."" Instead, Holliday described her son as a ""gentle spirit"" who would buy his mother's favorite ice cream and leave it in her freezer or leave a rose for her on her table. ""I wish he was still here with me,"" she said. ""I miss him so much.""","Omar Thornton killed eight people at a Connecticut beer distributor this month .

"(CNN) -- Shaquan Duley made a tearful first appearance Wednesday in a South Carolina courtroom to face murder charges in the deaths of her two toddler sons, her lawyer said. Handcuffed and dressed in orange jail coveralls, Duley sniffled and sobbed through her arraignment, which lasted less than three minutes. She entered no plea to the charges, and no date was set for her next appearance. Duley faces two counts of murder in the deaths of her two sons, 1-year-old Ja'van Duley and 2-year-old Devean Duley. Investigators said Duley, 29, was unemployed, single and apparently fed up with criticism from her mother when she smothered her children, strapped their lifeless bodies into car seats and submerged her car in the Edisto River. Her lawyer, Carl B. Grant, described her as ""distraught"" and said she was ""extremely sad and tearful"" during the proceedings. ""She had a solemn attitude and was crying before she entered court,"" Grant said. He said he has not yet seen the full case against Duley, but added, ""I can assure you there is more than has been said and reported by anyone."" Before the appearance, Grant said that if his client was asked to enter a plea, it would be ""not guilty."" Duley's mother, other relatives and members of her church attended to show their support during the arraignment, Grant said. The boys' bodies were discovered early Monday after witnesses reported Duley's car had gone into the Edisto River outside Orangeburg, about 75 miles northwest of Charleston. Orangeburg County Sheriff Larry Williams told reporters Duley had no means of taking care of her children. ""She lives with her mother, and her mother was a very, I guess, firm individual,"" Williams said. ""She often talked with her daughter about, I guess, maybe being more of a mother or being more reliable."" Mother and daughter argued the night before the children's bodies were found in Duley's Chrysler sedan, Williams said. ""We believe this is a direct response (to the argument) from Ms. Duley,"" he said. ""I believe she was just fed up with her mother telling her she couldn't take care of the children, and she wasn't taking care of her children, and she just wanted to be free."" However, he said, ""this wasn't a hardened criminal. This was a young lady in trouble, in trouble in more ways than she realized."" Duley has no previous criminal history, he said. Her third child, a 5-year-old daughter, was at the home of Duley's mother at the time of the deaths and did not appear in court Wednesday. Duley told authorities she smothered the boys by putting her hand over their mouths at the Trumps Inn in Orangeburg, Williams said. Then she drove them to the river while ""trying to find a way to discard the bodies,"" he said. ""She just wanted to get rid of the children, as sad as it may be,"" Williams said. Authorities do not know how long the boys had been dead before they went into the water, he said. Duley first reported that she had lost control of the car, and it had rolled into the river. But authorities believed her story didn't add up from the beginning, Williams said. Her clothes were dry, he said, and there were no skid marks or other indications of an accident at the scene. Authorities responded to a report of a car accident near a boat landing on the river Monday, and divers found the children's bodies. Williams described Duley as distraught, but said she showed no signs of remorse. ""I don't believe she woke up and said, 'I'm going to the Shillings Bridge Road to get rid of my children,' "" he said. ""Of course, that hasn't been determined. I believe she was just angry, upset and for some reason found the boat ramp, but mind you the children were deceased ... so (she was) trying to find a way to discard the bodies."" The father of the two children has not been found, Williams said. Duley ""was more or less being mother and father for the children,"" he said. The S.C. Department of Social Services has no record of prior involvement with Duley, department spokeswoman Marilyn Matheus said. The incident has striking similarities to a 1994 case, also in South Carolina. The bodies of Michael Daniel Smith, 3, and 14-month-old Alexander Tyler Smith were found in their mother's car, still strapped into their car seats, in a lake in the town of Union. Their mother, Susan Smith, was convicted on two counts of murder, but jurors spared her the death penalty and sentenced her to life in prison. In Session's Beth Karas, HLN's Natisha Lance and CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: Shaquan Duley was ""extremely sad and tearful"" in court, lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday was anything but a routine day for Deputy Brandon Jenkins, who spent three hours in his patrol car after nearly 50,000 honeybees decided to park on it. The Wake County Sheriff's Office officer had responded around 9:40 a.m. to a call of a person possibly being attacked by bees. He found a disabled truck on U.S. 64 a few miles east of Raleigh, North Carolina. Behind it was a trailer holding 60 boxes of bees. The truck driver, who was headed for Rocky Mount, had been hauling the bees at night, when they are quiet and not apt to fly. He spent a couple hours after daybreak trying to get someone to tow the trailer and his truck. That's when Jenkins, 31, pulled up 50 yards behind in his Dodge Charger. By then, the day was beginning to warm. ""The bees were hot and bothered,"" said Charles Heatherly, one of two beekeepers who later swarmed to Jenkins' assistance. It was not clear how the bees got away from the truck, but a lid from one box was seen on the side of the road. ""It was mind-boggling how many bees were out there,"" Jenkins told CNN. Eventually, the vehicles were towed off, leaving him still in his Dodge. ""I was told that usually when a truck starts moving, the bees will follow behind."" Wrong. Jennifer Keller, who assisted Heatherly, said the leftover bees were likely drawn to the light color of the Dodge. The insects spent the next three hours crawling over the vehicle, especially on the trunk and side panels. ""At some point, it was hard to see out of the windows,"" said Jenkins. Heatherly, a hobbyist, and Keller, a honeybee technician at North Carolina State University, went to work. ""They got a little testy,"" said Heatherly who, like Keller, was not wearing a protective body suit. They used smoke on the bees, which Keller says ""masks their communication,"" and a spray bottle of sugar water. The sticky mix makes it harder for the bees to fly and they concentrate on grooming themselves rather than attacking humans. At some point, Jenkins was advised to drive his patrol car some distance to blow the bees off. But that didn't work. Eventually, the beekeepers brushed the bees onto a piece of plastic and then into a hive box. Keller and Heatherly between them were stung only three or four times. Jenkins said about six bees got in his patrol car. He dispatched a couple when ""they got too close to my personal space."" Tuesday's incident was an unusual demonstration of how bees stick together. ""They pull together as a unit,"" said Keller. ""As a whole, they are quite amazing.""","North Carolina deputy spent three hours in car because of bees .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- The FBI said Tuesday it will look into an April 2009 beating of a man by Denver, Colorado, police, an incident that resulted in disciplinary action against two officers but no charges. Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper requested the investigation Tuesday, arguing that a federal probe would ""help ensure justice is appropriately served."" Tuesday afternoon, the FBI said it would look into the matter, but said little else. ""As with any allegation that may fall within the FBI's purview, the Denver office will conduct a review of those events to determine if there is a basis for a federal civil rights investigation,"" the bureau said. ""Per FBI policy, the Denver Division will not discuss ongoing investigative matters."" One of the two police officers involved received a three-day suspension and the other was docked a day's pay as a result of the incident, according to documents released by Denver officials Tuesday. In a statement released by his office, Hickenlooper said the video doesn't look good ""when viewed in isolation,"" but that it ""tells only a portion of the story."" The officers were disciplined for filing false reports after a review by the city's manager of safety, Ron Perea. But Perea said in a letter released Tuesday that the statements in their reports stemmed from ""more of a misperception"" than a ""willful, intentional or knowing"" attempt to deceive their superiors. ""Viewing the video alone is inflammatory,"" Perea wrote. ""However, when the entirety of the situation is reviewed as it should be, I believe I made an appropriate disciplinary decision."" Despite that finding, the city's independent monitor is now calling for the officers to be fired. ""It was clear to me they were trying to cover up what actually happened and make it look better than it was,"" said Richard Rosenthal, who reviews police internal investigations, told CNN affilliate KMGH. And Michael DeHerrera, the 24-year-old man seen being taken down and struck in the video footage recorded by a police camera, said Monday that he also wants the officers to lose their jobs. ""I think they should be fired, and if not, prosecuted for assault,"" DeHerrera said. ""I think if any one of us had done these actions and assaulted someone, we would all be in jail."" The scene was captured by a street surveillance camera located across the intersection from where the beating took place. On the video, DeHerrera is seen talking animatedly on a mobile phone while police officers kneel over a friend who was being arrested on charges of punching an off-duty officer working security at a bar. The friend was being thrown out of the bar when the altercation occurred, according to police reports. Another officer who responded the fight confronted DeHerrera, who was on the phone with his father, a veteran police officer. Soon afterward, the officer grabs DeHerrera by the head and shoves him to the pavement, and the camera pulls away seconds later. DeHerrera's father, Anthony DeHerrera, told HLN's ""Prime News"" that Denver police mishandled the situation. ""Officers have so many tools on their belts nowadays, there is no reason to take somebody down the way they did,"" said the elder DeHerrera, a veteran sheriff's deputy in southern Colorado's Pueblo County. He said he could hear sirens in the background while he was on the phone with his son, ""so I felt law enforcement was arriving and everything going to be OK,"" he said. ""And then I heard somebody in the background say 'Drop the phone,' and some obscenities. The next thing I hear is a thud. Then Michael was not talking anymore, so I knew it was Michael that got hit."" He said he yelled his son's name into the phone for about seven minutes, but, ""All we could hear was cussing in the background and some thuds."" The younger DeHerrera had a bloody nose and a cut above his left eye when a police sergeant questioned him after the incident, according to the sergeant's report. He admitted to grabbing police officers he said were struggling with his friend, but denied attempting to punch anyone.

"(CNN) -- I was out roaming the streets of east London with a group of friends back in 2007 when we stumbled across this sweaty hipster club tucked between an old church and a bank. It wasn't a very large space, holding maybe a couple of hundred people, but what it lacked in size was more than made up in the energy coming from the predominantly white, eclectic crowd on the dance floor. The music was a continuous flow of everything from '80s house music to current hip hop and I had just enough beers in me to join the raucous crowd in singing the words of each song at the top of my lungs. From Inner City's ""Big Fun"" to House of Pain's ""Jump Around,"" it seemed with each track, the crowd grew louder and louder. Then Kanye West's ""Gold Digger"" came on. For those of you who don't remember the chorus, allow me to refresh your memory: . ""Now I ain't sayin' she's a gold digger . But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas"" I've never sobered up so quickly before in my life. There I was, one of maybe a handful of black people in a crowded, dark room with hundreds of drunk white people yelling the N-word. Now obviously I never felt I was in any real danger. And even as the crowd repeated the word over and over and over again, not once did I think anyone around me meant anything malicious by it. Still, I became angry ... I just wasn't sure at whom. I thought, ""What is it with white people and that word?"" But then I also had to ask myself, ""What is it with black people and that word?"" After all, at least on that night, Kanye was the one who brought it up. Last week Dr. Laura Schlessinger used the word repeatedly on her radio show in a discussion with a caller. The knee jerk reaction to her rant is to demand she be fired. That was also the response to Don Imus' on-air racial slur back in 2007, and Rush Limbaugh's racially charged comment in 2003, and of course who can forget Jimmy The Greek for sort of getting the ball rolling in 1988. I believe Schlessinger and the others deserve the repercussions their actions have drawn, but I am frustrated that as a nation we continue to interpret the censure of such people as progress while ignoring some of the uncomfortable truths nestled inside their racist diatribes. It is in dissecting these uncomfortable truths that we get to the actual social progress, not with the cosmetic firings that make us all feel better for a moment. For example, I know there is a contingent of black people who claim our usage of the N-word is done so affectionately that's why it's OK for us to use it and not whites. I don't believe it's OK for anyone to use the word because of its undeniable link to one of the country's most brutal and disgusting periods. It was a word used to intimidate and belittle. Any attempt to alter its meaning through some warped sense of exclusivity is not only misguided, but disrespectful to the blood of both blacks and whites that was spilled in the name of racial equality. Yes, between friends it could hold a different connotation. But I would argue there is very little affection in Kanye using the word in a song, and that our continual injection of the word into pop culture is not only hypocritical but unintentionally gives white hipsters in London, Sydney, New York or any other city where a song like ""Gold Digger"" can be heard, permission to say it. The substantive question, the one that could lead to a better understanding, isn't who is saying the N-word, but why. Now, if a white person said something like that, they could be labeled a racist. Me? Someone out there is calling me an Uncle Tom right now. And it's this sophomoric labeling that keeps us locked in a hamster wheel. It's hard for me to believe that Schlessinger's remarks were rooted in a genuine yearning to promote honest dialogue about race --more like a belligerent attempt to shock, likely out of her own frustrations. How could a white person who has been in media as long as she has be ignorant of the ramifications of uttering the N-word on air? But she was right about one thing: Culturally neither blacks nor whites have the courage to talk honestly across color lines. We still act as if ""colorblindness"" can be achieved without addressing the nuances of race in a country with a complicated history such as ours. So, politically we coin euphemisms like ""inner city"" and ""real Americans"" as if no one knows what's really being said. We draw lines in the sand on topics such as the N-word and we're quick to assign harsh names to anyone who tries to cross that line, because bullying is much easier than listening. I know, I know, we have a black president, that's got to mean something, right? Yes, it does. But also keep in mind the nation has also seen a dramatic increase in hate group membership and we have a new political movement with racist organizers woven into the early stages of its fabric since the election of that black president. This language isn't helping. There is still a lot of work to be done and quite frankly the rebuke of Schlessinger does very little in addressing that work. Just as dismissing Imus, Limbaugh et al has done little. Public gaffes like these need to move beyond reactionary name-calling and firings and toward the kind of conversations that can only happen when we remove the muzzle of fear. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says he was at a club of mainly white people singing along to hip hop music .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The discovery of the exact location of a stockade and dozens of personal artifacts belonging to its Union prisoners is one of the biggest archaeological Civil War finds in decades, federal and Georgia officials said Monday. Outside of scholars and Civil War buffs, few people have heard of the Confederacy's Camp Lawton, which replaced the infamous and overcrowded Andersonville prison in fall 1864. For nearly 150 years, its exact location was not known, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Southern University said. Georgia Southern students earlier this year began their search at a state park and federal fish hatchery for evidence of the wall timbers and interior buildings. ""Archaeologists call it one of the most significant Civil War discoveries in decades,"" a joint statement read. Officials would provide no details until the formal announcement Wednesday morning at Magnolia Springs State Park, five miles north of Millen in southeast Georgia. An open house for the public will follow from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Life at Lawton, described as ""foul and fetid,"" wasn't much better than at Andersonville, with the exception of plentiful water from Magnolia Springs. In its six weeks' existence, between 725 and 1,330 men died at the prison camp. The 42-acre stockade held about 10,000 men before it was hastily closed when Union forces approached. Monday's announcement follows weeks of speculation that began after a locked chain-linked fence went up around the hatchery adjoining the state park. Townspeople in nearby Millen made the secrecy part of their water cooler discussions. ""It's created a lot of buzz, what's going on out there,"" said Connie Lee, owner of Cindy's Cafe, a popular meeting place in the town of about 3,500. Rumors have included the discovery of a chest with important papers, gold, a burial trench and, yes, even Union Gen. William Sherman's horse. There are no photos of Lawton and few visual stockade details, although a Union mapmaker painted some important watercolors of the prison. He also kept a 5,000-page journal that detailed the misery at Camp Lawton, which was built to hold up to 40,000 prisoners. ""The weather has been rainy and cold at nights,"" Pvt. Robert Knox Sneden, who was previously imprisoned at Andersonville, wrote in his diary on Nov. 1, 1864. ""Many prisoners have died from exposure, as not more than half of us have any shelter but a blanket propped upon sticks. . . . Our rations have grown smaller in bulk too, and we have the same hunger as of old."" The impending arrival of Federal forces during Sherman's March to the Sea soon forced the Confederates to move the prisoners elsewhere, including Florence, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. In early December 1864, Union cavalry found the empty prison, a freshly dug area and a board reading ""650 buried here."" Outraged, troops apparently burned much of the stockade and the camp buildings, and a depot and a hotel in Millen, which was a transportation hub. Many of the state park facilities -- including a pool, houses and the main office -- sit atop the prison site. Some earthworks, long known to visitors and historians, survived. The artifacts will deepen the knowledge of the tough daily life of prisoners and guards alike, said a historian who has completed a manuscript on the camp. ""[Lawton] illustrates almost every Civil War POW issue,"" said John K. Derden, professor emeritus at East Georgia College which has campuses in nearby Statesboro and Swainsboro. Derden cited health conditions, death rates, prisoner exchanges and the South's dwindling ability to manage a population where disease and poor sanitation were in abundance. Until now, Andersonville was the sole POW camp in the South to capture the public's attention and imagination. Besides the camp's own horrors, Clara Barton made Andersonville famous through her extensive campaign to have POW graves found and soldiers reinterred at a national cemetery. The prison's commandant, Henry H. Wirz, was hanged in 1865, the only man to be hanged for war crimes during the Civil War. Monuments dot Andersonville National Historic Site, which drew 136,000 visitors last year. A 1996 movie tells its story. None of that happened at Camp Lawton, where time and its remote location put it on the road to obscurity, fortunately for archaeologists. That promises to change beginning Wednesday, when the public will get its first glimpse of what life might have been like for prisoners, many of whom had been moved to Lawton from Andersonville. Lee and Walter Bragg, owner of Millen Auto Parts, hope anything associated with the discovery will boost the depressed area, where a 10.7 percent unemployment rate exceeds the state average. ""Our county [Jenkins] needs something to revitalize Millen,"" Lee said.","NEW: Research will expand knowledge of prisoners' daily life .

"St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) -- Oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico further east than previously suspected and at levels toxic to marine life, researchers reported Monday. Initial findings from a new survey of the Gulf conclude that dispersants may have sent the oil to the ocean floor, where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the Florida Panhandle. Plankton and other organisms showed a ""strong toxic response"" to the crude, according to researchers from the University of South Florida. ""The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life,"" said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at USF. Results of the latest survey are scheduled to be released Tuesday, but CNN obtained a summary of the initial conclusions Monday night. Tests conducted offshore indicate the oil matches the 205-million-gallon Deepwater Horizon spill, which has been temporarily capped for a month, the summary states. Some of it has spread into the DeSoto Canyon, a channel on the ocean floor east of the ruptured well. That canyon comprises part of the spawning grounds for much of the Gulf's commercial fish. ""To date, this is the easternmost location for the occurrence of subsurface oils,"" the report states. The oil is not ""draping"" across the bottom, but is spread out in ""small, unevenly distributed droplets,"" the report states. USF chemical oceanographer David Hollander said that when an ultraviolet light used to detect oil was turned onto the sea floor, ""All of a sudden, it turns out to be a constellation of little dots."" And the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later, Paul said. Or it could be eaten by fish and other animals and accumulate in the food chain, Hollander said. ""It's in such small droplets that you can see it -- you can filter it and see it,"" he said. ""But if you look at it, it's transparent, and small larval fish see these droplets as food so they're ingesting pure oil."" The Environmental Protection Agency has previously reported some oil turning up in the sediment at the bottom of the Gulf, but has not determined whether it came from the Deepwater Horizon spill that erupted in April or whether it was already present. And on August 4, the head of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration warned that oil could persist in the water even though the well has been temporarily capped. The oil company BP used more than 1.8 million gallons of chemical dispersants on the Deepwater Horizon spill between its eruption in late April and the time the well was capped in mid-July. BP says the chemicals allowed the oil to be broken up into droplets small enough that microbes can digest it, and the Environmental Protection Agency has said the dispersants were no more toxic than the oil itself. Critics warned the full effect of the dispersants on the food chain was not known and that their use in deep water effectively concealed the full extent of the spill. NOAA spokeswoman Mary Jane Schramm said on Monday that she had not seen the latest study and couldn't comment on it. BP spokesman John Curry, meanwhile, said the company wants ""to know everything everyone wants to know."" The company is responsible for capping, cleaning up and compensating victims of the oil spill, and it has committed to spending $500 million to research the spill's impact over the next 10 years. The latest study will ""add another piece to the puzzle,"" Curry said. ""There will be others that'll want to look at this study and want to look at doing some additional research,"" he said. ""There's been extensive testing up to this point, and I'm sure there will be much more going forward."" CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","South Florida researchers find oil traces in undersea Gulf canyon .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The city of Florence and the Italian government are embroiled in a dispute -- again -- over who owns one of the world's most famous statues, Michelangelo's David. The issue has been simmering for years. The Florence mayor's office said the debate began in the early 1990, and the city's various mayors have brought it up from time to time. It's mainly about the bottom line -- some 8 million euros a year in ticket sales at Florence's La Galleria dell'Accademia, also simply known as L'Accademia or the Accademia Gallery, where David is displayed. That money, however, goes to the Italian government, and not the city. Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi recently asked that David's earnings go to Florence instead, because ""after all, the David is ours,""' said one of his press officers. While tourism brings money to Florence, it also brings a lot of costs, such as cleaning and security, said the press officer.  The mayor does not feel it's fair that the burden of maintaining the city and its centuries-old buildings should fall solely on its citizens. Following the request, the Heritage Ministry commissioned a study to determine who is the rightful owner of David. The ministry's lawyers recently concluded that according to documents they found in archives, David belongs to Italy, not the city of Florence. The government bases that assumption on the fact that Italy paid for David to be moved from its original spot, in central Florence's Palazzo Vecchio, to L'Accademia, according to Renzi's press officer. Eugenio Giani, president of the Florence City Council, said in a statement Monday that ""the opinion of the Roman lawyers is very dangerous,"" noting all of the city's ""heritage"" that fills state museums. He points out that Florence's city hall commissioned and paid for the statue's creation in the 16th Century. It stood at the Palazzo Vecchio for nearly four centuries, until 1873, when it was moved to L'Accademia in order to better preserve it. When Italy was unified in 1871, the Palazzo Vecchio was returned to Florence under law, he said. Giani said his records show the new Rome-based Italian government paid to move David because it took the responsibility of ""tutelage"" over the new nation's heritage. ""The state did not for sure want to lay claim to the ownership of the David given two years' prior law,"" he said. ""Instead, it wanted to carry out a tutelage function, which is part of its competence to this day and by which the city of Florence had agreed to place the David at the Accademia."" Many of the paintings and statues in Italian-run Florence museums such as the Uffizzi Gallery belong to the city, Giani said. Some of the proceeds should be given to Florence, he said: ""The city of Florence has the right to partake in the profits."" Michelangelo, who was a native of Florence, completed the sculpture in 1504. It has been a symbol of Florence's defiance against its enemies ever since. Renzi told the Florence daily newspaper Il Corriere Fiorentino ""with all due respect to the Roman lawyers, the incontestable documents held in possession by the state administration are clear: the David belongs to the city of Florence."" The Italian Heritage Ministry's Sandro Bondi indicated in a statement Monday he is not ready to hand over ownership of the statue. Bondi said he found himself embroiled in ""an absurd and inopportune"" dispute about the statue ""against (his) will."" His statement referred to the question of the statue's ownership as ""a petty matter"" -- but one that also should ""be addressed in a sharing, planning manner."" He said he would work with Florence representatives in such a manner, with a goal of avoiding controversy.","The city of Florence and the Italian government are in dispute .

"London, England (CNN) -- Two U.S. senators from New Jersey intensified their calls for the British and Scottish governments -- and oil giant BP -- to provide information surrounding the circumstances of the convicted Lockerbie bomber's release a year ago. The British government urged Libya on Friday not to celebrate the anniversary of the convicted bomber's release, saying it would be ""offensive and deeply insensitive"" to the families of the 270 people killed in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland. Also Friday, the Obama administration again blasted the decision by Scotland to release Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi from prison exactly a year ago on compassionate grounds due to a diagnosis of terminal cancer. ""As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement. President Barack Obama's assistant on homeland security and counterterrorism, John Brennan, called the release of al Megrahi ""unfortunate and inappropriate."" Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg noted al Megrahi was only given three months to live when he released, but he is still alive today. Menendez noted that on August 20, 2009, al Megrahi stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in Libya. ""A mass murderer tasted freedom, experiencing joy,"" Menendez said. ""It was a scene that made the stomach turn ... that made old wounds fresh again in the hearts of those whose family members died at the hands of that man."" Lautenberg said, ""It is the families of those victims who deserve compassion, not this terrorist."" ""Al Megrahi ... is very much free, living in the lap of luxury by all accounts,"" Menendez said. Doctors who examined the convicted terrorist in prison now say he could live another 10 years, he said. The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic, and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release. Menendez said his office has sent letters to British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, ""laying out those areas where questions linger"" and asking for additional answers and documentation. Scottish authorities have defended their actions in the case, saying Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill relied on a medical report from the top doctor in the Scottish Prison Service, along with reports from the parole board and prison governor, in deciding to free al Megrahi, who had been serving a life sentence. ""We took the decision in good faith,"" Salmond told Sky News on Friday. ""We followed the judicial processes, the law of Scotland and the jurisdiction the Lockerbie atrocity has been governed [by], not for the last year, but for the last 20 years."" Under the Scotland Act of 1998, Scotland has its own government that is responsible for most of the day-to-day issues there, including the justice system. It took charge of the case because the flight al Megrahi was convicted of bombing exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Scottish authorities have insisted that three doctors hired by Libya to assess al Megrahi's condition last year played no part in the decision to release him. Menendez said he wants to know what was discussed when the doctors met with Libyan officials. Dr. Andrew Fraser, the director of health and care at the Scottish Prison Service, also said the three-month prognosis was a reasonable estimate. U.S. senators also have repeatedly voiced suspicions that Scotland released al Megrahi as part of a deal allowing BP to drill off the Libyan coast. Salmond has already shot down such concerns, saying ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" of any link. Menendez plans to chair a U.S. Senate hearing in September on the controversy surrounding al Megrahi's release. Friday, Menendez said the senators have asked the British and Scottish governments to conduct an independent investigation in the United Kingdom, which he said Cameron supported before he became prime minister. Lautenberg called on British and Scottish officials to stop ""stonewalling and side-tracking."" ""Help us clear the air; help us give information to the families."" Menendez also said letters are being sent to Libyan and Qatari leaders, inquiring whether ""commercial interests"" led them to pressure Britain and Scotland to release al Megrahi. Al Megrahi is the only person ever convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. Most of the dead were Americans. The flight had been heading to New York from Frankfurt, Germany, via London, England, when it blew up. A special Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted al Megrahi in 2001.","NEW: Clinton, Brennan blast decision to release al Megrahi .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court in San Francisco, California, has blocked same-sex marriages in that state from resuming immediately, until the three-judge panel hears broader questions over the constitutionality of such marriages. The brief order from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals late Monday set aside a federal judge's decision earlier this month that would have permitted same-sex marriages to resume in California as early as Wednesday. That came after the judge ruled a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage violated federal civil rights laws. The appeals court also set a fast schedule to hear the merits of the constitutional challenge to Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative defining marriage as only between one man and one woman. Oral arguments will now be held the week of December 6, meaning a decision on whether same-sex couples can legally wed likely will not be decided until sometime next year. Opponents of Proposition 8 seeking to overturn the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages will not appeal Monday's ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to spokesman Yousef Robb with the American Foundation for Equal Rights. Opponents could ask the Supreme Court to intervene on the narrow question of whether to allow the stay to be lifted, but both sides of the debate agree the odds of the justices getting involved at this stage are very slim. The case has had an up-and-down series of rulings and referendums. The state's high court had allowed same-sex marriage, but then the voter referendum two years ago passed with 52 percent of the vote. The California Supreme Court subsequently allowed that initiative to stand, saying it represented the will of the people. Opponents of the law next filed a federal challenge, saying the law violated 14th Amendment constitutional protections of due process and equal protection. Judge Vaughn Walker on August 4 agreed, issuing a 136-page opinion that concluded, ""Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license."" The Reagan-appointed judge added, ""Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples."" Same sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the District of Columbia, while civil unions are permitted in New Jersey. The five states are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa, and New Hampshire. Walker's landmark ruling assured a swift federal appeal that ultimately may reach the Supreme Court. One sticking point could be whether Proposition 8 supporters in court -- all private citizens and groups -- have legal ""standing"" to continue appealing the case. State officials, including the governor and attorney general, support individual same-sex couples challenging the law. Such state ""actors"" traditionally defend voter referendums and legislation. Some legal experts say if the appeals court eventually rules Proposition 8 backers cannot bring their petition for relief , the Supreme Court may not seek to intervene further, giving no clear guidance on the larger question of the constitutionality of same-sex marriage nationwide. The high court, in a 1997 unrelated appeal, had expressed ""grave doubts"" about the ability of such private groups to challenge rulings that strike down ballot initiatives. Walker's ruling had given the losing side a chance to appeal, and he held off allowing same-sex marriages from resuming until an emergency injunction request could be decided by the higher court. Among the federal appeals judges who agreed Monday to block same-sex marriages from resuming immediately was Sidney Thomas, a Montana native who was interviewed this spring by President Obama for the Supreme Court vacancy that eventually went to Elena Kagan. The case is Perry v. Schwarzenegger (10-16696).","California's Proposition 8 defines marriage as only between one man and one woman .

"(CNN) -- A vaccine to prevent HIV infection, the virus that leads to AIDS, has shown modest results for the first time, researchers have found, raising hopes that a disease that kills millions every year may someday be beaten. Researchers found those who received the vaccine combination were 31 percent less likely to contract HIV. In what is being called the world's largest HIV vaccine trial ever -- involving more than 16,000 participants in Thailand -- researchers found that people who received a series of inoculations of a prime vaccine and booster vaccine were 31 percent less likely to get HIV, compared with those on a placebo. ""Before this study, it was thought vaccine for HIV is not possible,"" Colonel Jerome Kim, who is the HIV vaccines product manager for the U.S. Army, told CNN. HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes AIDS -- acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Kim emphasized that the level of effectiveness of the latest vaccine was modest, but given the failures of previous HIV vaccine trials, ""yesterday we would have thought an HIV vaccine wasn't possible.""  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the excitement surrounding the vaccine Â» . He called the results from the trial an important first step that will help researchers work toward a more effective vaccine. Researchers have tried to prevent the spread of HIV since they discovered its cause in 1986. Previous vaccine trials failed to prevent infection. And during one trial, the vaccine seemed to boost the chance of being infected, which ended testing early. The new study was conducted in Thailand, with more than 16,000 people between ages 18 and 30 participating. They were all HIV negative at the beginning of the trial. Nearly 8,200 received a placebo and a similar number received a combination of six vaccines over six months. All were followed for three years. Researchers found that those who received the vaccine combination were 31 percent less likely to contract HIV compared with those on a placebo. ""This shows a statistically significant effect,"" Kim said. He cautioned that a lot more research was necessary, because the vaccine did not prevent everyone from being infected. Fifty-one people in the vaccine group eventually contracted HIV, compared with 74 in the placebo group. ""These results show that development of a safe and effective preventive HIV vaccine is possible,"" said Colonel Nelson Michael, who is director of the U.S. military HIV research program. The combination of vaccines tested targeted strains circulating in Thailand. It was unclear how the vaccines would work elsewhere, Kim said. Researchers will announce details of their initial findings at the AIDS Vaccine Conference next month in Paris, France. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. According to Kim, the U.S. military was involved in the study because U.S. service members are at risk and ""there's a national security threat from HIV."" He said Congress set up a program to protect service members from HIV and the U.S. military has collaborated with health officials and researchers in Thailand for a long time. The vaccines are manufactured by Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases and Sanofi Pasteur. The Thai Ministry of Health carried out the clinical trial. According to estimates by WHO and UNAIDS, 33 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2007. That same year, some 2.7 million people became newly infected, and 2 million died of AIDS, including 270,000 children. Two-thirds of HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa.","New vaccine cut risk of HIV infection by 31 percent in world's largest HIV trial .

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- A gunman who fired shots at a Texas police department near a college campus has been killed, the college said. Shots were fired Tuesday at the McKinney Police Department near Collin College's Central Park Campus in McKinney, Texas, according to campus spokeswoman Lisa Vasquez. The incident took place shortly after 9 a.m.  The gunman parked his car at the McKinney Police Department before the shooting took place, Vasquez said. She said the shooter has been killed, but it is not known whether he was killed by police or if he killed himself.  Vasquez said it does not appear that any students, faculty, or staff were injured in the incident. The college's emergency alert system notified students and staff immediately about the shooting and the campus was on lockdown for two hours.  Campus activities have since resumed, Vasquez said.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The former Israeli soldier who posted photos of herself on Facebook posing in front of blindfolded Palestinians waved off criticism of her actions, arguing that her behavior was no different than that of news outlets. ""This was just a military (service) experience,"" Eden Abergil said in an interview on Tuesday with Israeli Army Radio. ""The media does the same thing."" Abergil, the former soldier identified online as ""Eden from Ashdod,"" is seen smiling sitting on a blast barrier next to a blindfolded man. In another picture she is sitting in front of three blindfolded Palestinians, one with his hands tied in front of him. ""I ask the media -- when you take pictures of handcuffed prisoners for TV, do you ask for their permission? Do these Arab men agree to it? I really do not understand what is wrong. ""I have already apologized to the people who were actually hurt by me. This picture was without any political saying, just a thing of military (service) experience and no more."" Abergil was interviewed on Ilana Dayan's Nachon Lehaboker show. The photos have since been taken down from her Facebook site, but Israeli media reports the photos were labeled ""IDF -- best time of my life."" The photos have been slammed by Israelis and Palestinians. In another interview on Dayan's show, a Channel 2 Army commentator, Roni Daniel, expressed anger over Abergil's attitude. ""I deeply regret that she doesn't even understand what is wrong with this. I regret that the commanders did not see this (when it happened). It is unfitting, wrong and unethical,"" Daniel said. ""These photos are disgraceful; in no way does the IDF condone this behavior,"" said Israel Defense Forces spokesman Capt. Barak Raz in a written statement. ""In matters of information security aside, we are talking about a serious violation of the IDF ethical code, and I imagine that if she was on active duty today she would no doubt be court martialed."" Raz said Abergil left the military a year ago, but, ""nevertheless her commanders have been informed."" However, because Abergil has left the IDF it is not clear if the military will be able to take any action against her. Jawad Amawi, director of legal affairs for the Palestinian government's prisoners ministry, told CNN, ""She did this act while she was in military service, so in retrospect the Israeli occupation is responsible for her acts. This is a breach of international law, clearly a breach of human rights."" Amawi said his department will try to take legal action against the former soldier. Israeli media reported one of the comments posted by a friend of Abergil said, ""That looks really sexy for you."" The photo shows Abergil smiling in front of blindfolded prisoners. She posted this response: ""I wonder if he is on Facebook too -- I'll have to tag him in the photo,"" an apparent reference to one of the prisoners in the photo.","""Eden from Ashdod"" says she has apologized to those she hurt .

"Chachran Sharif, Pakistan (CNN) -- Imam Baksh used two cots as shelter over his head and a third to shield him from the drenched earth. The 80-year-old man was among thousands in Chachran Sharif who could see his home submerged under water -- about half of the Pakistani town looked more like a lake than a community of people. Even the mosque was under water and people were using boats to rescue their cows, goats and sheep, dragging the terrified animals onto dry -- or at least dryer -- land. Chachran Sharif, in Pakistan's Punjab province, is one of many villages, towns and cities across Pakistan reeling from torrential monsoon rain and flooding that authorities now say have affected 12 million people and killed as many as 1,500. Pakistan's disaster management authority estimated that 650,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed. By comparison, the earthquake of 2005 affected 3.2 million people and damaged or destroyed 611,000 homes. And no relief is in sight as the bloated Indus River overflows its banks and more rain continues to fall. Pakistan's Meteorological Department issued an alert for the southern province of Sindh, far away from the northern Swat Valley, where the crisis began. ""Pakistan has been hit by the worst flood of its history,"" said Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani in a televised speech Friday. ""As I speak, the flood is still engulfing new areas and adding to the scale of devastation."" Gilani said a true assessment of the loss to life and infrastructure can be determined only after the water recedes. He appealed to the international community and to Pakistanis living abroad to dig deep into their pockets. Relief agencies said donations are needed urgently to alleviate suffering. Patrick Fuller has worked for the International Red Cross for 15 years and been involved in other disasters. Still, he said Friday he was shocked by what he saw. ""These people need help desperately and the world needs to wake up,"" Fuller told CNN.  People can't go back to their homes. They are living in a precarious situation."" He said there has been a conspicuous absence of aid in some areas, despite efforts by the Red Cross and other international aid groups. Parts of the Swat Valley remain inaccessible by road; helicopters provide the only way in or out for people, food, clean water or medicine. At Chakdara, south of the valley's largest city, Mingora, people queued for more than four hours to cross a rickety temporary suspension bridge above swirling brown water. With the main highway crossing destroyed, people trying to escape were using a decrepit British-built 19th century bridge that was damaged in the rain. Meanwhile, among the suffering, anger grew at the government for perceived lack of action. Pakistanis hurled stinging criticism at President Asif Ali Zardari, who was in England for talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron during the worst of the crisis. Advisor Farahnaz Ispahani said Zardari was simply doing his job as head of state and had ensured the crisis at home was being adequately addressed by the prime minister. In Chachran Sharif, there were few signs of aid for the flood-displaced and frustration mixed with drizzle in the air. ""We elected him,"" one man said about Zardari. ""Where is he?"" U.S. emergency relief teams were continuing to arrive in Peshawar for distribution by Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, the State Department said Friday. In all, the U.S. Agency for International Development has committed $35 million in aid to international organizations and non-governmental organizations, it said. CNN's Reza Sayah, Dan Rivers and Moni Basu contributed to this story.","NEW: U.S. still sending aid to Pakistan .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations estimates more than a billion dollars damage from the Pakistan flooding. In a phone conference to reporters in New York Friday, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan said the cost to rebuild the affected parts of the country ""has to be measured in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more than a billion."" Martin Mogwanja, the UN's coordinator in Islamabad, Pakistan, said, ""There is going to be a tremendous cost in terms of repairing roads, bridges, telecommunications and electricity infrastructure,"" and most importantly, the farming and irrigation infrastructure. The United Nations is preparing an initial flood emergency response plan to address the immediate needs of Pakistan and the affected population, he said. Mogwanja said the response will cover 90 days initially and ""will address the most pressing needs in the area of food security, health care, sanitation and shelter."" The U.N. plan and a flash appeal for funding will be introduced to the international community in the near future, he said. ""An estimated 1,400 people have been killed by the flood waters so far, but this number may rise as new bodies may be found,"" said Mogwanja. The terrain is so waterlogged that many families can't bury their loved ones at traditional burial grounds. Some people are traveling to higher ground to conduct burials, and others are waiting for family members and the appropriate time, Mogwanja said. ""It is indeed, a very, very sad occasion,"" he said. ""More than 250,000 homes have been badly damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 1.5 million people homeless,"" said Mogwanja. To help combat homelessness, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has provided more than 11,000 tents. Pakistan has reported that at least 12 million people are affected by the flood but Mogwanja said only 4 million have been affected and that the estimate could rise. ""These estimates that we are providing are based upon the figures that we are receiving from the disaster management authorities in different provinces,"" Mogwanja said. He said monsoon season could last two to four weeks and that the United Nations and its partners have been providing emergency assistance since the start of the flood. The priorities which have been provided for so far include: 500 metric tons of food from the World Food Programme, clean drinking water from UNICEF to more than 700,000 people, and 40 cholera kits from the World Health Organization to health centers in Pakistan. ""However, this is only a small fraction of what is required, given the scale of this disaster and also its geographic scope, spreading across the poor, large provinces of the country,"" Mogwanja said.","U.N. estimates more than a billion dollars damage from the Pakistan flooding .

"(CNN) -- It was a Friday night in June 2007 when 22-year-old college student Kelly Nolan left her home to meet friends at a bar in Madison, Wisconsin. Kelly Nolan's body was found two weeks after she disappeared after a night out with friends. Police say she and three girlfriends spent the evening at a bar in the State Street area of Madison. About 11:30 p.m., Nolan and her friends separated, because her friends wanted to go home, and Nolan continued on to another bar. It is unclear exactly whom Nolan was with afterward. Two weeks after she went missing that night, her body was found in a wooded area on private property 11 miles from where she'd last been seen. The coroner and police have characterized her death as a homicide but have not released a cause of death or details on the condition of her body. ""We have collected a lot of crime scene evidence and feel confident this case can be solved,"" said Joel De Spain, a spokesman for the Madison Police Department. According to police, Nolan's last contact with anyone was a cell phone call in the early morning to her sister, April. Triangulation from pings on her cell phone led police to search the area where they found her body July 9. Tom Paras, owner of Amy's Cafe, a bar in the State Street area, said an employee met Nolan at another nearby watering hole called the Lava Lounge. Police won't confirm it, but the witness claims that he and Nolan walked out of the bar together because another male bar patron had been harassing Nolan, Paras said. ""The guy was giving her the creeps,"" Paras said. The two walked out, but then Nolan asked Paras' employee to wait for her to use the bathroom. ""They were both very drunk,"" Paras said, ""And he admits he was stupid to have left her there when he saw her talking to that guy again outside, but he assumed they were friends."" According to Paras, the real problem is that no one has an accurate description of this person of interest.  Watch an update on the case Â» . Furthermore, police have not revealed any possible motive in Nolan's murder, nor have they said whether she had been sexually assaulted. Investigators even reviewed surveillance video from the bar but found nothing that shows Nolan interacting with the individual last seen with her. There is a $12,000 reward being offered for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for Kelly Nolan's murder.

"(CNN) -- The United States and its allies have plenty to worry about in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with al Qaeda, two Talibans, the Haqqani Network and a plethora of other militant groups active. But the United States and intelligence analysts believe another group, one of Pakistan's most powerful and well-established, is also broadening its horizons. It is Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which means ""Army of the Pure."" It was blamed for the attack on Mumbai, India, hotels in November 2008 in which nearly 200 people were killed over three days. That attack ""shows the organization's global ambitions,"" said Dan Benjamin, the U.S. State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism. Bernjamin has been in Islamabad meeting Pakistani officials this week as part of a ""strategic dialogue"" between the United States and Pakistan. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba ""appears to have a very complex mix of indigenous and international targets,"" Benjamin said at a U.S. Embassy briefing Thursday. ""We are working with Pakistan's civilian authorities to investigate further into this organization, but definitely [Lashkar-e-Tayyiba] maintains some level of connections with al Qaeda,"" Benjamin said at the briefing [WHEN added above]. Earlier this year, Benjamin said of the Mumbai attacks: ""The target was set directly out of [Osama] bin Laden's book, filling the gap created by a diminished al Qaeda."" Lashkar-e-Tayyiba claims it is focused on the same issue as it was when created: freeing the disputed territory of Kashmir from Indian rule, experts say. In a rare interview earlier this year, the man widely regarded as the organization lader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, told The Independent newspaper that the group was not involved in the Mumbai attacks, despite substantial evidence to the contrary. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba was allegedly behind several high-profile attacks in India. And it is precisely because it is aimed at India's presence in Kashmir that the organization has been tolerated and even supported by Pakistani officials over the years -- even after it was banned there in 2002, intelligence officials and some Pakistani officials say. The current Pakistani ambassador to Washington, Husain Haqqani, wrote three years ago that Lashkar-e-Tayyiba was ""backed by Saudi money and protected by Pakistani intelligence services."" Saeed has been periodically put under house arrest when things have got a little overheated, but the group maintains an expansive compound near Lahore in Punjab and according to intelligence analysts remains well-connected to elements of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence or ISI. NATO in Afghanistan believes Lashkar is extensively involved with militant groups there. Friday, the International Security Assistance Force said it had detained a Taliban commander in the eastern Nangahar province who had ""assisted with the recent influx of [Lashkar-e-Tayyiba] insurgents into the province."" They are believed to have worked with the Haqqani Network to carry out attacks on Indian targets in Kabul, including several this year. Much to Pakistan's consternation, India has expanded its presence in Afghanistan, especially through Indian government-aided construction and training projects, since the overthrow of the Taliban. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba fighters are also believed to have joined the Taliban in attacks on U.S. Forward Operating Bases in eastern Afghanistan over the last couple of years. One scholar who has long studied Lashkar believes it is well placed to expand its activities. ""Evidence suggests Lashkar has support cells in the Persian Gulf, Britain, North America, mainland Europe, and possibly Australia,"" wrote Stephen Tankel this year in a paper for the New America Foundation. The case of David Headley suggests that is the case. The Pakistani-born American citizen confessed this year to a planning role in the Mumbai attacks and a conspiracy with senior figures in Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to attack the office in Copenhagen of the Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in 2005. He said he visited Pakistan several times to meet with Lashkar leaders.","Lashkar-e-Tayyiba blamed for attack on Mumbai, India, hotels in November 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Soccer City, once the venue of South Africa's most significant black freedom rallies, will next month host a sport that was open only to whites in the country's apartheid-rule era. Rugby officials announced on Wednesday that South Africa's Springboks will take on New Zealand's All Blacks at the Johannesburg soccer stadium, which stages the 2010 World Cup final this weekend. The rebuilt ground, scene of Nelson Mandela's first speech in the city after his release from prison in 1990, is situated near the predominantly black township of Soweto. ""This is an historic day and one in which the whole of South Africa can celebrate,"" South African Rugby Union president Oregan Hoskins said in a statement on the ruling body's website. ""Taking the Springboks to what is already an iconic world venue gives our players and supporters the best stage on which to enjoy rugby. But it also allows us to continue the nation building through sport that we have enjoyed throughout the FIFA World Cup."" Check out a 360-degree panorama of Soccer City . While South African rugby was once dominated by whites, the game has become more mixed there -- especially since hosting the 1995 World Cup -- and players such as Chester Williams and Bryan Habana have become household names. The Blue Bulls rugby team also played a Super 14 match at Soweto's Orlando Stadium in May this year as their home venue in Pretoria was unavailable due to the World Cup. The August 21 fixture will be South Africa's first home match of the 2010 Tri-Nations tournament, which also features Australia. Soccer City, which is also known as National Stadium, has a capacity of 88,791. The SARU has made some tickets available at reduced prices in order to get near the previous best crowd for a home rugby international -- 95,000 at Johannesburg's Ellis Park when the British Lions visited in 1955. More than 9,000 of the available tickets will be sold at 350 Rand ($45) and 5,000 for just 100 rand ($13). The match had originally been scheduled for Ellis Park, but host province Golden Lions agreed to make the switch. ""The only thing that surprised us was the near unanimity of our stakeholders in embracing this decision,"" Lions chairman Kevin De Klerk said. ""The reaction has been overwhelmingly positive and as much as we love Ellis Park, there was widespread agreement that we must take such a significant rugby match to one of the best stadiums not just in South Africa but in the world. ""I'd particularly like to thank [our] key sponsors ... They have had to make major sacrifices on some of their contractual rights but the way they have supported us in recognizing the potential benefits of this move -- not just for rugby, but for South Africa -- has been magnificent."" The Springboks will begin the defense of their Tri-Nations crown in New Zealand on Saturday, the first of two clashes with the Kiwis before heading to Australia for a match in Brisbane on July 24.","Soccer City will host a rugby union international between South Africa and New Zealand .

"(CNN) -- Federal officials have given the go-ahead for a motorcycle race in California's Johnson Valley Open Area, where a truck race turned deadly Saturday, killing eight and injuring nine, officials said Friday. The Bureau of Land Management issued a statement announcing it has granted the American Motorcycle Association approval to proceed with its scheduled off-road race in the Southern California desert area this weekend after assessing the association's safety and crowd control requirements. ""As part of an overall increased oversight of permit activities, the BLM has closely coordinated this weekend's event with the race promoter to ensure that the safety of the spectators and participants is of the highest priority,"" the statement said. ""Race coordinators have put in place additional safeguards at the start/finish line, pit row areas, and have increased security and medical presence to ensure safe racing conditions."" Bureau officials said they are working with enforcement agencies in the ongoing investigation into Saturday's deadly crash. For now, events promoted by Mojave Desert Racing remain suspended, it added. That organization was the promoter of last Saturday's race. Mojave Desert Racing was barred by the bureau Thursday.

"(CNN) -- The African American woman who called Dr. Laura Schlessinger for advice and heard the radio talk show host use the N-word 11 times said Thursday that she was confused and hurt by the call. ""I was calling her to get some help,"" Nita Hanson told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""I did not expect to hear the things that she said to me."" Hanson called Schlessinger August 11, seeking advice on how to deal with racist comments from her white husband's friends and relatives. The conversation evolved into a discussion on whether it's appropriate to ever use the N-word, with Schlessinger arguing it's used on HBO and by black comedians. National furor erupted after Schlessinger ended up using the word 11 times during the five-minute call with Hanson. ""It's never OK to use that word,"" Hanson said. ""I have a problem with Dr. Laura because she's old enough to know better. She knows where that word came from."" Join the discussion about disparaging words . The embattled Schlessinger, 63, announced Tuesday she will not renew her contract that is up at the end of the year, telling CNN's ""Larry King Live"" she wants to ""regain my First Amendment rights."" Schlessinger apologized for her remarks but Hanson said that was not good enough. ""I think she apologized because she got caught, to be honest with you,"" Hanson told CNN. ""At this point, there's nothing she can do for me."" In announcing her decision ""not to do radio anymore"" after being in the business for more than 30 years, Schlessinger said, ""I want to be able to say what's on my mind and in my heart and what I think is helpful and useful without somebody getting angry or some special-interest group deciding this is a time to silence a voice of dissent."" Hanson said Schlessinger's offense went beyond using a derogatory word. ""She said I shouldn't marry outside my race,"" Hanson said. Hanson has been married three years and called Schlessinger for advice after she kept hearing her husband's friends make comments about black people. She listened to Schlessinger's show all the time and trusted her, Hanson said. ""It's very hurtful,"" Hanson said. Schlessinger told CNN Tuesday that while she was still ""regretful"" over the incident, she feels her freedom of speech rights ""have been usurped by angry, hateful groups who don't want to debate -- they want to eliminate.""

"(CNN) -- The former mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey, was sentenced Thursday to two years in federal prison for accepting bribes in one of the state's largest political corruption scandals, according to the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey. Peter Cammarano III, 33, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Jose L. Linares to spend twenty-four months in prison for illegally accepting $25,000 in bribes -- all of which he must repay to the government. The judge also ordered Cammarano to two years of supervised release upon completion of his jail term. In April, the ex-mayor pleaded guilty before a federal judge to conspiracy and extortion, following his arrest just three weeks after becoming Hoboken's youngest mayor. The U.S. attorney's office said that Cammarano took bribes from a government witness who posed as a real estate developer in exchange for promised future assistance in Hoboken's government matters. Prosecutors said that at his plea hearing, Cammarano said that he accepted three illegal cash payments from the government witness. Two payments, totaling $15,000, were received while he was a councilman at-large for Hoboken. He further admitted that he accepted an added $10,000 after being elected and sworn in as mayor. Shortly after his arrest, Cammarano stepped down as mayor of Hoboken. In a statement to the city clerk's office at the time, he denied all criminal wrongdoing, but said the charges had disrupted the city government and his ability to perform his duties as mayor . The U.S. attorney's statement said that Cammarano's sentencing resulted from an undercover FBI investigation into public corruption and money-laundering. Cammarano was one of 44 civic leaders and public officials nabbed in an investigation called ""Operation Bid Rig."" In a statement to CNN, Cammarano's attorney, Joseph A Hayden, said, ""Peter Cammarano made a catastrophic mistake with respect to his conduct. He has accepted responsibility and pleaded guilty. He will serve his sentence. He is a young man and will rebuild his life. In the future he will once again make positive contributions to society."" Cammarano is free on bond and is scheduled surrender to authorities on September 20, 2010, to being his prison term.","Peter Cammarano III was Hoboken's youngest mayor .

Police did not say what led to the arrest, but Michael -- whose real name is Georgios Panayiotou -- was widely reported to have been involved in an accident in the early hours of July 4, in which he allegedly crashed his car into a north London photo shop. Michael was found guilty in 2007 of unfit driving through tiredness and prescription medication and received a two-year driving ban, according to British media.

"(CNN) -- Intan Suci Nurhati was on her way to a religious gathering when her sisters called to say they were under attack. ""They were running for their safety as they called,"" she said. ""When I heard, I realized how far it was to the main compound, and I was like, 'Oh, my God.' "" Nurhati and her family are members of a Muslim minority sect called the Ahmadi, who hold annual gatherings in each country where they have a community. It was in July 2005 that the Indonesian gathering came under attack by -- Nurhati estimates -- 10,000 people throwing stones. The protesters outnumbered the Ahmadi by 100 to 1. Nurhati was on her way to the gathering in Parung, West Java province, from the capital Jakarta with a member of the Indonesian Parliament when the attack happened. By the time she arrived, houses and books had been burned, she said. ""No one was killed, but there were some minor injuries from the throwing of rocks. We decided to call off the conference. It was unsafe to go on with the gathering,"" said Nurhati, 27, a graduate student studying climate change at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. ""There was so much anger in their faces,"" said Nurhati, a native of Indonesia who has been living in the United States for 10 years. Police provided buses to get the Ahmadi community to safety, but Nurhati does not know of any arrests or prosecutions as a result of the attack. ""It was really disappointing. We have the right to be there. But the police were trying to minimize the clashes, rather than trying to say we have the right to be there,"" she said. Indonesia -- the most populous Muslim country in the world -- is often touted as an example of tolerance and democracy in the Islamic world. But a huge new study suggests it's actually among the most restrictive countries in the world when it comes to religion. The study charted publicly reported incidents of religious violence, intolerance, intimidation and discrimination in 198 countries and territories from mid-2006 to mid-2008, its authors said. Brian Grim, the lead researcher on the project, said he worked on the study for more than three years. The report looks not only at legal restrictions, but also at how laws are implemented and how social tensions restrict freedom of religion, even where there is no official or legal bar against the practice. Indonesia has both. In fact, more than two out of three people around the world live in countries with high or very high restrictions on religion, according to the report, which claims to be the first to systematically measure religious discrimination. It produced some surprising findings and makes it possible to compare countries in ways that could not be done before, its authors say. ""Most reports don't try to quantify,"" Grim said. ""What you are left with is studies that don't allow you to see patterns."" The study, ""Global Restrictions on Religion,"" found some interesting ones. For example, ""religion-related violence happens in the majority of countries, but only in one in 10 does that escalate"" to terrorism causing casualties, Grim said. The study tracked violence between religious groups in 126 countries -- 64 percent of the countries in the survey. But there was religion-related terrorism leading to injury or death in only 17 countries -- 9 percent of those in the study. In about a quarter of all countries, majority groups use force or threat of force against minority religions, according to the study, from the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington. Nearly half of all countries restrict the activities of foreign missionaries or prohibit them altogether. Ninety percent have some requirement that religious groups register with the government, usually in return for some benefit such as a tax exemption. But in 40 percent of countries, those registration requirements result in major problems for those groups. ""Others often focus on naming and shaming, but this one is looking more in depth at what goes on on the street in countries -- what affects a person's ability to freely practice religion in society,"" Grim said. ""Sometimes, one incident of violence can affect a whole country."" The report also makes it possible to compare what kinds of restrictions are placed on religious practices in different countries. China, for example, has tight legal controls on the practice of religion, but has has relatively little social conflict over faith. India, by contrast, has only moderate government restrictions on religious observance, but very high levels of social hostility -- primarily between Muslims and Hindus. Brazil has the lowest ratings in both categories among the 25 largest countries in the world, while Pakistan has the highest, followed closely by Indonesia. Egypt, Iran and Bangladesh also rate poorly for religious freedom, while Japan, the United States, South Africa, Italy and the United Kingdom score well. European governments place more restrictions on religion than do governments in sub-Saharan Africa or South America, the survey concluded. While the U.S. has a low level of government restriction on religion, it does experience a moderate amount of social tension, the report found. ""The test is not whether someone who belongs to the majority faith and is affluent and is socially advanced feels restrictions, but whether religious minorities do,"" said Alan Cooperman, associate director of research at the Pew Forum. ""So in the United States, what does a Muslim woman who wears a hijab in a small city feel?"" Religious discrimination in the United States is not simply a matter of people feeling uncomfortable, he added. ""Law enforcement officials report to the FBI every year on hate crimes, including religious bias,"" he said. ""There were about 1,400 each year [in the study], and they were reported in nearly all 50 states. Those crimes run the gamut, but they include arsons."" The U.S. was also marked down because of the Bush administration's ""global war on terror,"" Grim said. ""The fact [is] that we have detainees from a war that at least one side is calling religion-related -- the Guantanamo detainees,"" he said. Neither the September 11, 2001, attacks and their aftermath, nor the shootings at Fort Hood in Texas this year were included in the time period covered by the study, he said, but both could have increased the U.S. score for social hostilities based on religion, Grim said. ""Scores are not fixed. Situations can change, which is why we are looking at this as an over-time study,"" he said. ""Countries and societies will change in how they respond to the situations they face."" In fact, the authors plan to revisit the question of religious restrictions regularly, so they can track changes over time, and the U.S. might rank differently when the Fort Hood shootings are included -- if investigators rule that they were motivated at least partly by religion. The study authors do not assign motives to incidents of discrimination, instead relying on local sources to determine the causes. The study does not rank countries from ""best"" to ""worst"" -- saying such a list would not be meaningful -- but instead groups them into those with very high restrictions, high restrictions, moderate or low. It does not include North Korea, because there is not enough reliable data from the reclusive communist state, the authors said.

"(CNN) -- Amber Lemna says studying ""The Secret"" is changing her life for the better. The 2006 book and film discusses the law of attraction, something adherents say allows people to attract what they want by envisioning it and believing it will come. Lemna says she's used it to kick-start a business idea: attaching decorated tabs to credit cards so people can easily pull the cards from wallets. Thanks to ""The Secret,"" she says, she's attracted people and resources to help her and already is selling the tabs in 10 local stores. ""Nothing has been the same since I've listened to the CD [of the book],"" said Lemna, 29. ""I can control how my day goes."" So the Minneapolis, Minnesota-area insurance agent bristles when she hears people using the troubles of self-help entrepreneur James Arthur Ray, who appears in but did not create ""The Secret"" film, to bash the attraction principles. Ray integrates the law of attraction into his teachings on obtaining spiritual, financial, mental and physical wealth. He postponed all his scheduled events through the end of the year after three people died after spending time in a sweat lodge session he led near Sedona, Arizona, in October. Police are investigating the deaths, and Ray has said his organization is working with authorities to determine what happened; no charges have been filed. ""It works with or without him,"" Lemna said of the book and film -- both works of Australian TV producer Rhonda Byrne. ""[Ray is] just an advocate."" Self-help is a multibillion-dollar-a-year unregulated industry in the United States, according to John C. Norcross, professor of psychology at the University of Scranton. Norcross says hundreds of quality, research-supported self-help programs on career growth, health and self-esteem exist. But he and other critics say some gurus, promising secrets to greater happiness and wealth, offer advice that at best isn't proven effective and at worst could send someone down a poorly suited or dangerous path. ""You can publish anything making the most outrageous claims as long as it's not libelous,"" said Norcross, co-author of ""Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health."" Norcross takes particular umbrage at Ray and law of attraction advocates, saying they generally offer anecdotal evidence that their way works, but don't offer scientific evidence to support the claims. Ray, who has written books and holds seminars and other events, says on his Web site that he blends ""the practical and mystical into a usable and easy-to-access formula for achieving true wealth across all aspects of life."" His six-step Journey of Power series of events costs participants thousands of dollars. One of the steps, the Spiritual Warrior retreat, which was under way when the October sweat lodge deaths happened, costs $9,695 per person. ""When people are pursuing a program of undocumented effectiveness, they are not spending time and money pursuing a program they know works,"" Norcross said. A media representative for Ray declined to comment about the criticism. Dave Orton, who has attended several of Ray's programs, says Ray's techniques have helped him break habits and thoughts that hindered him and have given him tools to achieve goals ""in a more elegant and rapid manner."" The 33-year-old technology-company program manager from Boise, Idaho, says Ray's and other self-help programs helped him get his professional certification in project management. Orton, who wasn't at the event near Sedona, says the deaths were tragic and unacceptable. But he says he isn't turned off to the self-help industry or Ray's teachings, and he may be interested in attending another Ray event in the future. ""The results in my own life, that's what I'd trust more than a third-party study,"" Orton said. ""My [project management] certificate is hanging on the wall right now. It's not just a dream."" Psychologists: How to choose . Several people trained in psychology, however, told CNN that too many self-help authors and presenters offer little scientific evidence that backs up their claims. Gerald Rosen, a clinical psychologist in Seattle, Washington, says he believes more self-help books should undergo pre-publication testing -- especially those written by psychologists, who he says should be held to a high professional standard. ""When you look at a book for depression, there probably isn't a blurb on the back that says this book has been shown in studies to help 65 percent of those who have been diagnosed with this. There's just a claim that this can happen for you,"" said Rosen, a former chairman of the American Psychological Association's task force on self-help therapies. Norcross says that a lack of scientific evidence isn't the only thing to look out for. Other characteristics that should make consumers wary, he says: . â¢ Authors or speakers who don't have formal training in the featured topic. ""They should look for someone with rigorous training at an accredited university and who has spent years investigating and conducting these treatments,"" Norcross said. â¢ Programs that don't screen consumers for problems. For example, Norcross says, certain programs might be harmful for a person with bipolar disorder. â¢ People who reject conventional knowledge and instead imply a revolutionary secret. ""It's marketing, essentially,"" Norcross said. â¢ People who propose solutions for all problems instead of particular problems. Michael Shermer, executive director of the Skeptics Society, said consumers should be wary of programs that cost a lot of money but teach no hands-on skills. ""It's one thing to pay a trade school. It's another to pay the same kind of money to ... seek a mystical effect on your prosperity,"" said Shermer, who holds a master's degree in experimental psychology and a doctorate in the history of science. He also warns that the effects can be fleeting. ""Corporate America has wasted millions"" on motivational seminars, Shermer said. ""The marketing and sales guys get fired up, but the effects of those types of seminars are weeks at minimum, months at best. That's why a lot of them do corporate retreats every six months, because the effects fade."" Shermer suggests that consumers try out a self-help adviser's book or tape before committing to an expensive getaway ""to see if there's a connection for you."" People interested in a program also should talk to previous participants at least six months after they used it, he said. ""If you talked a day after, they would have to rationalize it to a certain extent [even if it were no good] because they just paid a lot of money,"" Shermer said. As for Lemna, she says the changes in her life are all the proof she needs that ""The Secret"" is working. ""I'm sure there are people who need [scientific evidence], fine. Then find something that works for you,"" she said.","Psychologists: Look for authors, teachers backed by research and formal training .
Some programs don't screen for conditions that might make someone ill-suited, expert says .
""The Secret"" user: Changes in my life are all the proof I need that it works ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An ill-tempered CONCACAF Gold Cup match between Mexico and Panama recently saw three players and Mexico coach Javier Aguirre sent off amid violent scenes in Houston, Texas. Newcastle teammates Lee Bowyer (left) and Kieron Dyer turn against one-another. The 1-1 draw, which saw the referee add on 10 minutes at the end for all the various stoppages, got Fanzone thinking about some of the most controversial match melees that have occurred. Do you agree with our worst 11? Post your comments in the Sound Off box below. 1 The Battle of Santiago, Chile v Italy, World Cup 1962 . Surely the most violent match in history. The tone was set when the first foul was committed after 12 seconds. Two Italian players were sent off as the teams spent the whole 90 minutes punching, spitting and scuffling with each other, with Chile managing to score two goals in-between the fighting. Police had to come onto the pitch three times to sort out the chaos while Italian Giorgio Ferrini had to be escorted off by armed officers when he refused to leave the pitch after his dismissal. Referee Ken Aston remarked: ""I wasn't reffing a football match, I was acting as an umpire in military maneuvers."" 2 Valencia v Inter Milan, Champions League 2007 . Six yellow cards were handed out during the game, but it was events that followed which marred Valencia's passage through to the quarterfinals. On the final whistle, Inter midfielder Nicolas Burdisso came together with Valencia defender Carlos Marchena, sparking a brawl. Unused Valencia substitute David Navarro then ran onto the field, to join in  - the result of which was a broken nose for Burdisso.  Navarro, retreated to the sidelines chased and kicked by Inter players Julio Cruz, Ivan Cordoba. The melee continued in the tunnel, with the Spanish Civil Guard eventually needed to quell the problem. UEFA, European football's governing body, subsequently fined Navarro $200,000 and banned the player for eight games, Burdisso was slapped with an eight-match suspension, Maicon for six, CÃ³rdoba for three games and Julio Cruz for two. 3 Turkey v Switzerland, World Cup play-off 2006 . Violence erupted after Turkey missed a place in the 2006 finals after going out on the away goals rule following a 4-2 win in Istanbul. Players and technical staff were seen throwing punches in the tunnel as the Swiss side ran for their lives against a torrent of Turkish anger. Turkey assistant-coach Mehmet Ozdilek was banned from all football for one year, while two Turkish players, and one Swiss, were handed six-match bans. Turkey were also ordered to play their next six competitive home matches behind closed doors at neutral venues. Have we missed a famous punch-up out? Leave your suggestions below . 4 Manchester United v Arsenal, English Division One 1990 . These two rivals have been involved in some juicy encounters over the years, but this is one of the most infamous. Arsenal defender Nigel Winterburn went in late on Manchester United's Denis Irwin prompting chaos, as 21 players, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman proving the exception, joining in the fracas. Remarkably nobody was sent off but the English Football Association took a dim view and deducted Arsenal two league points and United one. Arsenal won the match 1-0 and still went on to lift the title. 5 France v Italy, World Cup final 2006 . The great Zinedine Zidane had led an unfancied and ageing French side to the World Cup final. With the match level in extra time, the attentions of notorious Italian hard-man and chief agitator Marco Materazzi finally proved too much for the France No.10 - who responded to some choice words by the Inter Milan central defender by turning around and viciously head-butting his rival in the stomach. Zidane was sent off. France eventually lost on penalties and the Real Madrid playmaker bizarrely went on to be voted 'Player of the Tournament'. 6 Kevin Keegan v Billy Bremner, Liverpool v Leeds Charity Shield 1974 . England striker Keegan blamed Bremner for ""taking him out"" in an off the ball. Bremner was not one for holding back and Wembley stadium, home of some famous boxing matches over the years, played host to another as these two diminutive players slugged it out like two featherweights challenging for the WBC world title. Unsurprisingly both were sent off and added to their charge list by hurling their tops to the ground and walking off the pitch bare-chested. Each player was fined Â£500 ($810) and banned for 11 games, although shirt-throwing accounted for eight of the matches! 7 Rudi Voeller v Frank Rijkaard, Netherlands v Germany World Cup 1990 . Not the most violent, but certainly one of the funniest. The pair were sniping at each other throughout the match. Rijkaard came in late on Voeller, who later took his revenge with a lunge on goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen. Rijkaard took exception and, after a melee, the pair were sent off, with the Dutchman then notoriously spitting as hard as he could into the German's curly perm as the disgraced pair left the pitch. 8 Lee Bowyer v Kieron Dyer, Newcastle v Aston Villa English Premier League 2005 . Punch-ups are rare in modern football, but between teammates they are non-existent. These two hot-heads got into a debate over Dyer's refusal to pass Bowyer the ball. Both players had made news for their off-field activities in the past - but they took their behavior to a new low when they exchanged blows in the middle of the Newcastle half soon after Villa had gone 3-0 up. The pair later appeared alongside manager Graeme Souness to apologize for their conduct, but pointedly did not say sorry to each other. 9 LDU Quito v Barcelona, Ecuador league 2006 . A mass brawl at the end of the match on the final day of the season shocked Ecuador - and resulted in a host of suspensions being handed out. A total of 11 players were banned for between two and 12 months for taking part in the punch-up which saw four Barcelona players receive injuries. The incident started with a clash between former Ecuador striker Agustin Delgado and his marker Victor Montoya. 10 Cruzeiro v Atletico Mineiro Brazilian league 2007 . Atletico Mineiro defender Coelho did not take kindly to the seal dribble of talented teenager Kerlon - who collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area, flicked it up and performed his trademark dribble by bouncing the ball on his head as he ran towards goal. Coelho crashed into him and was given a straight red card and a four-month suspension. Other Atletico players remonstrated angrily with Kerlon, leading to an angry pushing match which interrupted the game for five minutes. Atletico coach Emerson Leao warned that Kerlon could get seriously injured if he tried the trick again. 11 Chelsea v Arsenal English League Cup final 2007 . With Chelsea winning 2-1 Arsenal defender Kolo Toure reacted angrily to a late challenge. Both sides had a number of African players in their line-ups and a mass brawl erupted which saw three of them, Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor, Toure and Chelsea's John Obi Mikel sent off. Adebayor refused to leave the pitch and it needed respective managers - the hot-headed pair of Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho - to stride onto the turf and defuse the situation.","Football Fanzone presents a rundown of 11 infamous pitch punch-ups .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Federal officials Thursday barred the promoters of last week's deadly off-road race in Southern California from holding future races on public land while an investigation is under way. Saturday night's crash in the desert east of Los Angeles left eight people dead and nine injured when a truck taking part in the 200-mile event crashed into a crowd of spectators along the track. The driver won't face charges in the accident, the California Highway Patrol announced Monday, but the federal Bureau of Land Management is investigating whether sanctioning body Mojave Desert Racing violated any safety regulations. According to its permit, Mojave Desert Racing had five more races scheduled for 2010. The company has not responded to repeated calls for comment since Saturday's fatal crash. ""BLM has suspended any future permitted events of MDR Productions while the investigation is underway,"" the agency announced Thursday. In addition, another promoter's upcoming motorcycle race is under new scrutiny, and future events ""are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis,"" BLM said in a written statement. The agency said that off-highway races are a popular activity and that its investigation ""will be aimed at ensuring the public safety remains our first priority."" Last weekend's race was part of an amateur series on a course in the Lucerne Valley area of San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles. Mojave Desert Racing urges spectators to stay back 100 feet from the 50-mile course, but a California Highway Patrol spokesman said there were ""no delineations"" for the course. Images from the night of the crash show trucks speeding within feet of spectators. Brett Sloppy, the driver of the out-of-control truck, did not respond to repeated requests for comment but announced in a post on his Facebook page that he was devastated by what happened. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to all the familys and friends involved,"" he wrote. ""Thank you too all my friends for sticking with me even thru these tragic times I love you all."" Keith Carty, a friend of one of the victims in the California crash, told CNN's HLN that races attract a certain type of person: someone who wants to participate as much as watch an event. ""It's not anybody's turn to baby-sit us. We're out there. We understand the risk. Everybody that was there understood the risk: the drivers, the spectators, everybody,"" he said. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","Organizers of a race that turned deadly are barred from racing on public land .

"Editor's note: Zeyno Baran, a native of Turkey, is senior fellow for the Center for Islam, Democracy and the Future of the Muslim World at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank that says it is dedicated to ""global security, prosperity and freedom."" From January 2003 until 2006, Baran directed the International Security and Energy Programs at The Nixon Center. Zeyno Baran says the United States can learn much from Turkey's expertise on Afghanistan and Pakistan. (CNN) -- Turks greeted President Obama with huge excitement Monday. This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start. His address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy. That said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward. Despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral. With Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the ""good war."" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help? Turkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together. Reading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women. No matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences. Instead, the Obama administration needs to think of ""victory"" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing. Indeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies. There are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions. Still, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way. Just as President Obama referred to his personal story and that of the United States to help Turks look deeper within, Turks can do the same for the United States. To start, Turkey can explain how the vast Eurasian region it belongs to is not just part of the ""Muslim world"" but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia. Moreover, each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations, and these do not move fast. It is important to stop and drink the tea. Turkey can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their Sufi teachings that talk about love, instead of hatred. As a true partner, it can also help the United States recognize its share, along with many others, in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the Taliban and al-Qaeda by making bad foreign policy choices. Anything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future. In other words, we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zeyno Baran.","Zeyno Baran: Obama's speech shows deep understanding of Turkey .

"(CNN) -- ""This can be yours,"" the black-and-white newspaper advertisement promised above an image of a tree-lined ranch home in Pontchartrain Park. At the bottom, it said ""Available to Negroes."" It was the 1950s in segregated New Orleans, Louisiana, and the promise of a slice of suburbia for black Americans lured hundreds to the new community. That included Meldon Woods, an Air Force corporal who had been given a home loan for his military service through the GI Bill. He and his wife, Audrey, a schoolteacher at the time, purchased a two-story home in 1957 where they raised their four children. Fifty years later, he was forced to evacuate that home as Hurricane Katrina bore down on New Orleans on August 29, 2005. ""My husband said, no, he was not leaving, because he was upstairs and if the water came, he'd be upstairs,"" Audrey Woods recalled. ""I never would have left him. So my youngest son, he came and said, 'Mama, get in the car. Daddy get in the car.' "" Meldon Woods eventually relented and left his home and the neighborhood he helped turn into a strong, solid African-American community. Katrina whipped up 15-foot waves on Lake Pontchartrain, flooding the London Canal levee that lies west of Pontchartrain Park. As much as 20 feet of water flooded the neighborhood. Not a single home in Pontchartrain Park was left unscathed. Water rose nearly to the rooftop of the Woods' home, where Meldon had planned to ride out the storm. A few weeks later, they returned to utter devastation. ""I didn't know whether to cry, scream. I didn't really know what to do,"" Audrey Woods said. ""But my knees kind of buckled when I looked in here and I was, 'Oh my God.' "" The elderly couple didn't waste any time reflecting: They immediately focused on rebuilding. ""They had on these white suits with white masks ... and they're hauling out pieces of sheet rock,"" said Justin Woods, the youngest of the Woods' four children. ""My father with a cane, carrying a piece of sheet rock out.  And I remember calling Rhea and saying, 'Do you know what your parents are doing? They're gutting the house ... by themselves.' "" It was the same spirit and determination that helped create Pontchartrain Park where, according to many locals, children were raised with a sense of community and family. All four of the Woods' children went on to become successful in their careers -- a common theme for the children of Pontchartrain Park such as Lisa Jackson, the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency; jazz musician Terence Blanchard; former mayors Ernest and Mark Morial; and actor Wendell Pierce from HBO's ""The Wire."" Interactive: Meet the residents of Pontchartrain Park . Even BP vice president and spokesman Darryl Willis, originally from Louisiana, is rebuilding his home in Pontchartrain Park as he continues to manage the Gulf oil disaster. Those successes were built on the sacrifices of the men and women who settled in Pontchartrain Park, says Pierce, who now spends his time in New Orleans starring in the new HBO series ""Treme"" about post-Katrina New Orleans. ""My parents' generation took something ugly like segregation and turned it into ... one of the most stable American neighborhoods, not only in this city, but around the country,"" he said. ""It was [a] dogged fight by these young parents who had this opportunity to build a life for their families in one of the most difficult times in modern history: Jim Crow segregation, Deep South, New Orleans."" That fight to create a better future for their kids instilled a deep sense of commitment to the neighborhood in Pierce. And that is why the actor has committed the past two years to rebuilding Pontchartrain Park. Pierce staged a massive effort to get the city of New Orleans to start rebuilding the neighborhood's blighted and abandoned properties. Only 30 percent of the neighborhood's residents had returned two years after Katrina -- the second slowest rate of return in New Orleans behind the city's devastated and impoverished Ninth Ward, according to Pierce. Opinion: Russel HonorÃ© on New Orleans today . With the help of Troy Henry, a management consultant and boyhood friend, Pierce formed a nonprofit community corporation to get the city to sell back some of the houses so they could be rebuilt and resold at an affordable price. It has not all been smooth sailing -- some locals have criticized his involvement. ""I got a lot of pushback that I was, you know, a local kid come home with some success and trying to do a land grab myself,"" Pierce told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. ""It was hurtful."" In November 2008, New Orleans signed a deal with Pierce's Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corporation to rebuild 400 homes. It was a huge success, but the start of a slow process: A year-and-a-half after the agreement, the city had turned over only four plots. Today, Pierce is credited with raising the return rate in The Park from about 33 percent to more than 50 percent. But not every former resident wants to return. Lisa Oubre wants nothing to do with her husband's plan to rebuild their home in Pontchartrain Park, where they raised their son before Katrina. Hurby Oubre wants Jacques, who was 10 years old when Katrina struck, to enjoy the same childhood he experienced growing up in Pontchartrain Park. ""It was a real neighborhood. Everyone knew who you were,"" Hurby said. ""Everyone looked out for you. Your neighbors, they'd chastise you [if] they saw you doing something wrong."" Since 2005, the Oubre family has been split between two cities: Hurby works in New Orleans as a mail carrier, while Lisa is employed in Baton Rouge, where she lives with Jacques who is now in high school. She has no plans to return to Pontchartrain Park. ""I can't go back there, I can't do that again,"" Lisa said. ""God knows we've lost enough. We lost every single thing we've ever owned up to that day in 2005. ... When is the ripple effect going to stop rolling over our lives?"" Hurby still holds out hope that one day his family will be reunited in Pontchartrain Park. ""That's my home. ... I wasn't going to let it die, and I knew that. I always felt that. I always said I'd go back,"" he said. ""You can't really get frustrated or angry with anybody for going through that traumatic experience and not wanting to come back."" When asked who he's building his home for, he responds, ""Hopefully I'm building it for my family.""","African-Americans could buy houses in Pontchartrain Park in the 1950s .

"(CNN) -- The White House Press Office accidentally e-mailed a draft version of President Obama's Thursday schedule on Wednesday night that included the back-and-forth between White House staffers. Members of the media got a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into President Obama's schedule. The e-mail, sent on a daily basis to inform the media of the next day's events, at first appeared to be like any other press schedule. But at the bottom of the e-mail, there was a series of exchanges from the press team, as well as a draft of the schedule. The first section of the schedule noted that in the morning, Obama planned to talk with homeowners who have refinanced their homes and benefited from lower mortgage payments. One staffer, recommending changes to that line, wrote to ""put more emphasis on the real people aspect of this."" The draft version said Obama will talk ""with his economic team,"" and also attending the meeting ""will be a handful of households."" The final version took the emphasis off the economic team and said ""Attending the meeting will be a handful of homeowners ... as well as members of President Obama's economic team."" The draft schedule also showed the president hosting Seder to celebrate Passover. The dinner was marked ""closed press,"" meaning no reporters allowed. One staffer asked, ""Can we remove the dinner at the end of the day?"" ""We put it on yesterday's deal -- so folks already know that it's happening. They'll wonder why it's not listed if we don't include it on there,"" another staffer replied. The staffer who asked to remove the dinner from the schedule replied, ""Apparently Jewish here and in neighboring states are now calling wondering why they have not been invited."" The dinner was not listed on the final schedule. In another exchange, one staffer recommended nixing a line about Obama meeting with leaders from the Veterans Service Organizations and Military Service Organizations since the president was now meeting with them before his remarks in an event closed to the media. ""Can we keep it and just change it to say before. Its good for us to say we are meeting with them,"" another replied. The final copy kept the line, noting that the VSO and MSO leaders would meet with Obama before his remarks. The White House says the error was made by a sleep-deprived staffer, adding that the staffer will not suffer repercussions for the mistake.","E-mail of President Obama's schedule includes back-and-forth between staffers .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of a small Louisiana town was indicted on several charges for allegedly accepting bribes from businesspeople, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Thomas A. Nelson Jr., 40, the mayor of New Roads, Louisiana, is charged with violating the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Louisiana said in a statement. Nelson also is charged with wire fraud, using an interstate facility in aid of racketeering, making false statements to the FBI and forfeiture, prosecutors said. If convicted, Nelson faces up to 65 years in prison and a $1.75 million fine, authorities said. His indictment came as part of an ongoing investigation known as ""Operation Blighted Officials."" According to a superseding indictment, Nelson allegedly obtained ""thousands of dollars in cash and other things of value, such as tickets to sporting events, luxury hotel rooms and meals from businesspeople in exchange for using his position as mayor for the benefit of the businesspeople in connection with transactions Nelson believed were worth millions of dollars,"" the statement said. ""The superseding indictment further alleges that Nelson deprived the citizens of New Roads of his honest services as mayor and lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" authorities said.

"(CNN) -- Residents in Seattle, Washington, were shaken Tuesday afternoon by what sounded like explosions after two F-15s were dispatched in response to a report of a small plane that entered restricted airspace where President Barack Obama was campaigning for Sen. Patty Murray. The rumblings -- caused by sonic booms from the jets -- rattled buildings, windows and nerves in the Puget Sound region, according to CNN affiliate KIRO. Viewers of the affiliate from as far away as Tacoma -- about 40 miles south of Seattle -- reported hearing the booms. Dozens of residents called the city's 911 system, causing it to shut down in some areas for about an hour due to the flood of calls, Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department told KIRO.

"(CNN) -- The average American woman can live long enough to celebrate her 80th birthday, so if a woman is able to become pregnant using in vitro fertilization with a donor egg at 56, she could still watch her child grow into an adult. But just because it's possible, does that mean she should? Some feel that having children after 45 is unfair because the parents might not live to see the kids become adults. The death of 69-year-old Maria del Carmen Bousada of Spain, who used in vitro fertilization with a donor egg to have twin boys at 66, has the fertility treatment community bracing for a backlash. It could rival the fallout from octuplet mom Nadya Suleman -- and it seems to have already started. In a national online survey about fertility conducted in May by Johnson & Johnson's Babycenter.com, 7 out of 10 moms who responded wanted tougher regulation laws for IVF treatments, and half of the 1,095 respondents thought it was bad for the children if a parent conceived past 45. Fertility specialists understand those concerns, but they say it's not that simple. Although it's rare for anyone older than 55 to get the go-ahead for IVF, that guideline is peer-enforced rather than mandated, and decisions typically are made on a case-by-case basis. Georgia Dardick, an advertising executive in Boynton Beach, Florida, was one of those cases. Dardick tried to conceive via IVF six times and seriously considered adoption, but at 51, she wasn't ready to let go of her desire to have a baby. ""Fifty was the cutoff for my doctor, but they agreed to give us one more try,"" she said. She had her daughter in January. Dardick said she never planned to have a baby at 51, but feels that she made the right decision, despite the judgments others may have. ""The word selfish has come into my mind. But for any parent, having a child is selfish. No matter what your age is, once you have that child, you owe that child everything. I live the best, healthiest life I can."" Doctors say society's views of aging needs to change. ""The 40 and 45-year-old of today is not the 40-year-old of the past; the 50-year-old [today] is not the same of the past,"" said Dr. John Jain, a physician at the Santa Monica (California) Fertility Clinic who has treated age-related infertility for 15 years. ""They're eating healthy. A woman who is 45 is barely halfway through [her] life."" Healthy or not, having a child at that age can cause tremendous stress on the body. Candidates for IVF after 45 use either an egg donor or their own frozen embryos from a prior cycle and are screened for underlying medical problems, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension or lung disease, said Dr. Charles Coddington of the Mayo Clinic's reproductive endocrinology department in Rochester, Minnesota. Still, ""if somebody were in good health, it would be hard to say, 'you shouldn't have a baby,' "" he said. ""One has to judge where they are, health-wise and financially."" But if a woman who claims to be 55 is actually in her mid-60s -- as Bousada reportedly did -- what's a doctor to do? Not much, physicians say.  Watch report on death of 69-year-old mother Â» . ""The truth may get dimmed to fit into the realm of a patient that may be acceptable. I don't sit there and say, 'Go get your birth certificate.' If someone's coming in and they're saying they're 52 or 55, I take it at face value,"" Coddington said, who does refer questionable cases to the fertility center's ethics board. Even for those who choose to use it, the availability of this technology can be a double-edged sword. Dardick said she wouldn't change anything, but if she did have to do it all over again, she said she may have considered adoption earlier. ""In a way, there's this hope always out there for you, and once you get into it, it's harder to break away,"" she said. It's the intense desire to have a biological child that Manhattan-based psychotherapist Joan Winograd, who specializes in fertility issues for women 40 and older, has been treating for 20 years. ""I work with women who've been very successful. They went to the right schools, got married and they feel that everything comes to you if you work hard. But then they realize pregnancy doesn't happen that way,"" said Winograd. She helps her clients find balance -- and limits -- by creating a plan: How long should they try IVF? How long until they consider adoption or child-free living? ""They need that."" Winograd said, ""because many times a doctor will say, 'Look, this is your money, this is your dream; who am I to say that you can't do it anymore.'"" While doctors do help women try to reach their dream, Jain said he isn't afraid to tell a patient ""no"" if they simply aren't healthy enough -- or are just too old. But, Jain said, it's all based on his judgment as a trained physician. ""Ninety-five percent of us do a great job about regulating ourselves. I personally don't want to see more regulation, because it becomes problematic, and it can be more costly. Someone who's failed three cycles and [has already spent] $50,000 -- with the next cycle, will I be more aggressive? Certainly,"" Jain said. ""But maybe there's a middle ground, if the rule is that donor IVF will not be offered for women over 55 years of age. Regulations at the extremes might be useful."" Even though Dardick plans on living her life as a new mom for quite some time, she said having a baby at her age isn't ideal. She and her husband are taking careful precautions by adjusting their financial planning to make sure their daughter will be financially secure. They're also tightening bonds with extended family and friends, should anything happen to her or her husband -- a decision Bousada may have made as well, as her twin boys are now in the custody of a relative. Those, Dardick said, are the decisions one has to make when having a child later in life. """"People feel that it's not fair to the child because you may not live long enough,"" Dardick said. But as someone who lost a father as a teenager, she knows ""there are no guarantees in life.""","If a woman is in good health, she can conceive and give birth into her 50s .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The number of U.S. troops remaining in Iraq is about 52,000, the U.S. military said Thursday. That puts U.S. Forces-Iraq on track to draw down to 50,000 troops by September 1, when Operation New Dawn is to begin and forces are to switch to an advise-and-assist role. The Pentagon on Wednesday had estimated the number of U.S. forces in Iraq at 56,000, which reflected the last calculation conducted August 17, the military said in a news release. The 4,000-member 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team departed to Kuwait on Wednesday and Thursday. The brigade's departure comes more than seven years after U.S. combat forces entered Iraq, though it does not signify the end of all U.S. combat forces in the country. In all, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq has decreased by more than 90,000 in the past 18 months and Obama has promised that all U.S. forces will be out by the end of 2011. But there is plenty of work left to do, former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said Wednesday. ""Iraq is still at the beginning of the story of its evolution since 2003,"" he said, referring to the date of the U.S.-led invasion of the country. In fact, Iraq has been without a functioning government for more than five months, electricity and other utilities are available only sporadically in the capital, and violence appears to be increasing. At least 48 people were killed Tuesday in an attack outside a military recruiting center in Baghdad. ""We're going to have to leave a large footprint behind, and this is not going away for us as an issue,"" Crocker said. The State Department is preparing to make up much of that footprint. It will handle many of the responsibilities currently shouldered by the military, increasing its security contractors from 2,700 to nearly 7,000, sources said. They are expected to work with diplomats and police trainers in some facilities. The State Department has asked for an additional $400 million to cover the costs, though it was not clear it would get it. The State Department has asked the U.S. military to leave behind surveillance systems, about 50 bomb-resistant vehicles and a few dozen UH-60 helicopters, a military official said. Although the department got a lot of what it wanted, the Pentagon said it could not give them all the helicopters because they are needed in Afghanistan, the official said. According to the Pentagon, 4,419 U.S. troops have died in Iraq. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Adam Levine contributed to this story.","Military had estimated troop strength at 56,000 on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Alberto Contador was crowned Tour de France champion for the third time on Sunday as Mark Cavendish won the final stage of cycling's premier event, which was delayed after seven-time winner Lance Armstrong's team were ordered to change their jerseys. Contador had the customary winner's cruise into the Champs-Elysees in Paris, having taken a 39-second lead over Andy Schleck in what is the traditionally decisive penultimate stage on Saturday. He was 81st in a 161-strong peloton behind Cavendish -- all credited with the same time of two hours, 42 minutes and 21 seconds -- with Armstrong 106th as he completed his final Tour in 23rd overall. The 38-year-old finished more than 39 minutes behind Contador, his teammate at Astana last year, after suffering from crashes early on in the grueling 21-stage race. Armstrong team removes special jerseys for cancer survivors . Russia's Denis Menchov was third overall ahead of Contador's fellow Spaniard Samuel Sanchez. ""It is a Tour in which I had a lot of pressure, especially physically as I was not at my best level. It took a lot of confidence to face difficult situations,"" the 27-year-old Contador told the race's official website. ""Today is therefore a great relief for me, it is a moment that I feel like I've been liberated from all the pressure. ""The three wins are all very different. The first, in 2007, had something special, precisely because that was the first. Last year, the context was difficult and this made it difficult. And this year I have had difficult moments, but I could count on a strong team. ""I realize that each year I gain in experience. I know better manage a team throughout the race. Now I am happy to enjoy this victory and I'll take a good vacation."" British rider Cavendish triumphed in the closing leg of the three-week event for the second year in a row, his fifth stage win of 2010, but his late burst was not enough to deny Alessandro Petacchi the sprinters' title. Petacchi finished second ahead of New Zealand's Julian Dean to become only the second Italian to win the green jersey. ""I'm disappointed this year not to win the green jersey. I set out to do so -- it was a target for this year -- but I had some bad luck in the first days and was out of the running,"" Cavendish said. ""But the team fought back, did our best and I lost it by 11 points. But we won five stages and we've got to be happy with this year's Tour."" Armstrong's Radioshack claimed the overall team prize as Christopher Horner was 10th overall, Levi Leipheimer 13th and Andreas Kloeden 14th. They were made to take off special black jerseys worn to promote Armstrong's cancer charity during the neutral zone run ahead of the official start of the 102-kilometer stage from Longjumeau. The peloton, which set a slow pace anyway, waited as the American and his teammates changed back into their regulation jerseys. France's Anthony Chartreau claimed the climbers' title, while Saxo Bank's Schleck was the top young rider.","Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador wins Tour de France for the third time in four years .

"(CNN) -- Wildlife researchers in Sri Lanka have photographed one of the world's most reclusive primates for the first time. Sightings of the Horton Plains slender loris -- a small nocturnal primate with extremely thin arms and legs and huge round eyes -- are so rare that the creature has only been seen four times since 1937. Conservationists feared the species had become extinct during a 63-year gap between sightings from 1939 to 2002. Populations of all types of slender loris, which are native to the rainforests of Sri Lanka and southern India, have been in decline in recent years because of destruction of their forest habitat by logging, agriculture and development. That prompted an 18-month study of the creatures led by researchers working for the Zoological Society of London's Edge project -- a conservation initiative dedicated to raising awareness about the plight of animals on the brink of extinction. Researchers from the University of Colombo and the Open University of Sri Lanka also took part. Research leader Saman Gamage said more than 1,000 nocturnal studies in 120 different forest areas had been conducted as part of the study. ""This discovery is a great reward for the ongoing field research we undertake across much of south-western Sri Lanka,"" Gamage said. ZSL Conservation biologist Dr. Craig Turner said the study was the first close examination of a Horton Plains slender loris ever conducted. The pictures show a 20-centimeter long male adult sitting on a forest branch forest. Conservationists have discovered it appears to have shorter and sturdier limbs than other loris; a possible adaptation for the cooler, high-altitude montane -- or cloud -- forest in which it lives. That could mean the Horton Plains slender loris is a distinct species in its own right, said Gamage. Results of the study are published in the latest edition of the journal Primate Conservation. ""We are thrilled to have captured the first ever photographs and prove its continued existence -- especially after its 65 year disappearing act,"" said Turner. ""The discovery improves our knowledge of this species, but we need to focus our efforts on the conservation and restoration of the remaining montane forest where this species still exists. Currently this accounts for less than one percent of the land area of Sri Lanka.""","Horton Plains slender loris only seen four times since 1937 .

"(CNN) -- The Cameroon Football Federation has appointed veteran Spaniard Javier Clemente as the coach of the African country's national team. The 60-year-old, who has previous international experience with Spain and Serbia, returns to management after a short stint at relegated La Liga club Real Valladolid at the end of last season. He replaces Frenchman Paul Le Guen, who stepped down from the role after Cameroon lost all three matches at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Clemente becomes Cameroon's fourth coach since May 2009, with German Otto Pfister and Thomas Nkono having also been charge in that time, and will sign a two-year contract. ""Javier Clemente is the new coach of Cameroon. The signing of the contract will take place in Yaounde on August 28,"" read a statement on the Cameroon federation's official website on Tuesday.

"New York (CNN) -- A team of prosecutors and a panel of law enforcement, legal and social science experts are being assembled to reinvestigate the case of a man convicted in 1988 of sexually abusing children, according to a statement issued on Tuesday by the Nassau County District Attorney's office. ""A prosecutor's job is not to obtain convictions, but to obtain justice. I cannot predict whether or not our investigation will corroborate the criminal case brought against Mr. [Jesse] Friedman more than two decades ago. What I can guarantee is that my investigation will be thorough andit will be fair,"" Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said in a statement. Nassau County is on Long Island. The announcement to reopen the case comes in response to a federal appeals court decision that suggested prosecutors had an ""ethical obligation"" to reopen the 1988 child molestation case of Friedman. He was the focus of a 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary, ""Capturing the Friedmans."" Friedman shared his reaction with CNN Tuesday night in an e-mail: ""I am concerned, given my history with the Nassau County prosecutor's office, of their ability to conduct a fair review of their colleagues. However, taking Kathleen Rice at her word, I am optimistic and hopeful for the first time in more years then I care to admit."" The 31-page decision, released Monday, questioned ""the process by which the petitioner's conviction was obtained"" and suggested that because of the ""vast moral panic"" about child sexual abuse that was prevalent in the late 1980s and early '90s might have led police officials to cut corners in their investigation. In unusually strong language, the 2nd Circuit Court decision stated that ""... the police, prosecutors and the judge did everything they could to coerce a guilty plea and avoid a trial"" and said there was a ""reasonable likelihood"" Friedman was ""wrongfully convicted"" of sexually abusing children. Friedman, 41, served 13 years in prison and another five on parole. He said he was still digesting the court's decision on Tuesday. ""If the charges went away, that would be wonderful,"" he said. Friedman said he has tried for 20 years to revoke his guilty plea, saying that at the time there was ""no other viable option, the system was in place."" He said he was offered a guaranteed six- to 18-year sentence in exchange for not pursuing a trial and feared the judge would give him 1,000 years if he didn't plead guilty. ""If I went to trial, I was doomed,"" he said. The court decision stated that although by law the court could not overturn Friedman'sconviction as it was filed too late, it suggested that the Nassau County prosecutor's office reinvestigate the case. The decision cited New York law, which states that it was a prosecutor's duty to ""take reasonable remedial measures when it appears likely that an innocent person was wrongly convicted."" Friedman was 19 when he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing over a dozen children with his father, Arnold Friedman. His father committed suicide in 1995 in prison. Friedman and his father held computer classes in the basement of their suburban home in Great Neck, New York, where the attacks allegedly took place. In 2003, while watching the documentary ""Capturing the Friedmans,"" he found out that many of the children who accused Friedman of sexually abusing them had been put through hypnotic therapy sessions to recall the attacks. Friedman's attorney, Ronald Kuby, said that it was an opportunity for the prosecutor's office to ""cure an injustice"" and hoped it would end with a decision that Friedman was wrongfully convicted. Friedman, who was paroled in 2001, said he wasn't sure how much it would really change his day-to-day life at this point. ""I don't get those years back, but it would be nice to have my innocence declared, I am not a child molester."" He said he has an online book business selling popular fiction, which he runs from his home on the U.S. East Coast, where he lives with his wife.  ""My focus is on tomorrow,"" he said.","NEW: ""I am optimistic and hopeful for the first time"" in years, Jesse Friedman says .

"(CNN) -- The imprisoned former mayor of Detroit, Kwame Kilpatrick, was charged with sexual misconduct during a visit by his wife on July Fourth, according to a report released by the Michigan Bureau of Prisons. ""A correctional officer observed him touch the wife on her breast,"" said Russ Marlan, a spokesman for the bureau. ""All prisoners know it's against the rules,"" Marlan said of such contact. The report states that a correctional officer observed via a prison video feed Kilpatrick touch his wife, Carlita Kilpatrick, on her breast with his right hand in the prison visiting room at Oaks Correctional Facility in Manistee. If found guilty of the misconduct Kilpatrick could lose certain privileges, including a loss of visitations from his wife. According to Marlan, the incident also will be discussed during a parole hearing for Kilpatrick in a year. Prisoners are allowed one kiss with visitors and are allowed to hold hands in photographs. Anything else is considered to be misconduct, the prison spokesman said. ""To many it may seem like not a big deal, but we do have people passing contraband back and forth, as well as children in that room,"" said Marlan. Kilpatrick currently is serving a maximum five-year sentence in Michigan for violating probation in a 2008 case against him. That case involved two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from Kilpatrick's efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer attempting to serve a subpoena on one of his friends in that case. On Tuesday, the former mayor was arraigned in federal court on 19 counts of felony fraud and tax charges. He is accused of using the Kilpatrick Civic Fund -- a tax-exempt fund meant to pay for voter education -- to make cash payments to himself, his family and friends.","Kwame Kilpatrick is serving 5-year sentence in Michigan .

"(CNN) -- Researchers have made an unexpected discovery among the items a member of the Donner Party kept in a carpetbag on the group's ill-fated journey to California: a military document with Abraham Lincoln's handwriting on it. Donner Party member James Reed and his family carried muster rolls with Lincoln's name on them among their treasured heirlooms, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum said in a statement released Monday. A team of librarians, historians and handwriting experts combined forces to confirm that Lincoln's writing was on one of the documents, which list Lincoln and volunteer soldiers who fought in the 1832 Black Hawk War. ""We often find documents that detail fascinating stories about Abraham Lincoln's life and times, but it is rare indeed for the document to have such an intriguing history after it was written,"" said Daniel Stowell, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. ""That these documents detail part of Lincoln's military service and that they accompanied the Donner Party to California makes them doubly significant."" All four of the muster rolls include ""Private Abraham Lincoln"" among the list of soldiers. On one of them, experts say two-and-a-half lines are clearly written in Lincoln's hand. And the documents reveal that Lincoln had a horse worth $85 and equipment valued at $15, noting that Lincoln received one tent that was United States property to be returned at the end of his service. The lines Lincoln wrote said: ""Muster Roll of Captain Jacob M. Earleys Company of Mounted Volunteers Mustered out of the service of the United States By order of Brigadier General Atkinson of the United States army on White Water Rivers of Rock River on the 10th day of July 1832."" The documents are part of the James Frazier Reed Collection at the California State Library. Reed's name appears just beneath Lincoln's on the list. He was one of the organizing members of the Donner Party, the group of pioneers known for resorting to cannibalism while enduring a harsh winter in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He likely inherited the papers from the military company's commander and took them with him when he left Springfield, Illinois, in April 1846 because they were part of his personal history, the Lincoln Presidential Library said. While historians believe the papers accompanied the Donner Party for their entire journey, Reed did not. He was banished from the group after fighting with a teamster and stabbing him to death, Monday's library statement said. He left the papers with his wife after being expelled from the party, and ""she brought them safely in her bosom to California when helped by the first relief party which went to their assistance,"" daughter Martha Jane ""Patty"" Reed recalled.","Experts say military list includes Abraham Lincoln's handwriting .

"(CNN) -- A former Alabama assistant district attorney who specialized in prosecuting sex crimes against minors is accused of enticing what he thought was a teenage girl online for sexual purposes, authorities said. Steven Giardini was indicted on charges of enticement and solicitation crimes over the computer with the intent to produce child pornography, the Alabama Attorney General's Office said in a statement. Giardini, a former prosecutor in Mobile County, was arrested Tuesday. The charges stem from the suspect's alleged communication with what he thought was a 15-year-girl, Alabama Attorney General Troy King said in a statement Tuesday. But instead he was communicating with an agent from the FBI's Internet Crimes Against Children division. The Attorney General's Family Protection Unit presented evidence to a Mobile County, Alabama, grand jury August 13, which handed up the indictment. ""The crimes alleged in this indictment are all the more horrifying in that the defendant was a prosecutor entrusted to protect citizens from evil and criminal wrongdoing,"" King said. ""The people of Alabama should be reassured, however, that no one is above the law, and that those who seek to harm and exploit our children will be punished, whoever they are."" Giardini is charged with one count of acting with the intent to entice a child under the age of 16 for intercourse, sodomy or sexual purposes; one count of acting with the intent to criminally solicit the production of child pornography; and one count of acting with the intent to entice a child for sexual purposes by means of computer, telephone, personal digital assistant, or other electronic means of communication or information storage. All three charges are felonies. The first is punishable upon conviction by a prison sentence of one to 10 years, with the last two punishable by a two-to-20-year sentence, according to the attorney general's office. Giardini resigned from the district attorney's office in April 2009 after FBI agents searched his Mobile home, CNN affiliate WALA-TV reported. It is not known what they were looking for, the station reported; the search warrant was sealed by a federal judge. Giardini's attorney, Dennis Knizley, noted it has been 16 months since that search, WALA said. ""And of course, his life has been on hold since then,"" Knizley told the station. ""The facts of the case will turn out to be interesting and (we will) address those when we go to trial."" Knizley denied that Giardini was trying to manufacture child pornography. Giardini was booked into the Mobile County Metro Jail and released on $250,000 bond, WALA said.

Police tape cordons off the crime scene in Binghamton, New York, on Saturday. ""From the people close to him, the actions that he took were not a surprise to them,"" Chief Joseph Zikuski told reporters at a noon news conference. The police chief said that ""some of this behavior on his part wasn't a total shock,"" but did not elaborate what, if any, previous behavior he meant. A federal law enforcement source identified the suspected gunman as Jiverly Wong. Zikuski said Wong, who was from Vietnam, was 41 and had changed his last name to Voong. ""Apparently people were making fun of him. He felt he was being degraded because of his inability to speak English, and he was upset about that,"" Zikuski said.  Watch police question whether teasing led to shooting rampage Â» . Wong also was upset about recently losing a job, Zikuski said.

The receptionist, who had pretended to be dead before crawling under a desk, said she was shot in the stomach, Zikuski said.  Watch Zikuski give a timeline of the shooting Â» . ""[She's a] very brave lady,"" the police chief said. Police arrived on the scene minutes after the phone call; by that time, the shooting had stopped. The woman is among the four wounded, he said; she is in serious condition. Before entering the building's front door, Wong had apparently used his father's car to barricade the building's door, Binghamton Mayor Matthew Ryan said. Wong then entered the building front door armed with two handguns, and without saying a word, began shooting, police said. Ryan said two semi-automatic handguns -- a .45-caliber and a 9-millimeter -- found at the center were licensed to Wong. Authorities executed a search warrant at Wong's home in Johnson City, just outside Binghamton, where he lived with his family, Ryan said. ""They took a computer hard drive -- they took an empty long gun case, and some other bags,"" he said. State police received a tip in 1999 from a confidential informant who told them Wong was planning a bank robbery, Zikuski said. The information indicated Wong had a crack or cocaine habit and owned handguns, Zikuski said, and he did not provide additional information. Binghamton, a city of about 50,000 people, is close to the Pennsylvania state line and about 140 miles northwest of New York City.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday blasted Scottish authorities' decision to release the convicted Lockerbie bomber last year and agreed on the need to push for a more transparent disclosure of the circumstances surrounding Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi's release. Cameron, however, said he is opposed to a British government investigation into the release. The two leaders also said they addressed a range of issues in talks at the White House, including the war in Afghanistan, sanctions against Iran, the state of the global economy and the responsibilities of BP -- a British company -- after the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. ""We can never say it enough. The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy a truly special relationship,"" Obama said.  ""We celebrate a common heritage.  We cherish common values. ... (And) above all, our alliance thrives because it advances our common interests."" The meeting was part of Cameron's first U.S. visit as Britain's leader. The two men met with reporters shortly after huddling behind closed doors. Cameron said the release of al Megrahi, who had been sentenced to life for his role in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, was ""wholly wrong.""  Al Megrahi, he said, was ""the biggest mass murder in British history."" The 1988 bombing killed 270 people. Cameron promised that the British government will cooperate with a congressional investigation into the controversy, though he stressed that the decision to release al Megrahi was made by the Scottish government without any involvement from BP. ""There is absolutely no harm to be done in giving the fullest possible explanation"" regarding the decision to release al Megrahi, Cameron said.  ""But I don't think there's any great mystery here.  It was simply a ""misguided decision"" by Scottish authorities. The Scottish government freed al Megrahi last August on compassionate grounds after doctors said he had terminal prostate cancer and just three months to live.  Al Megrahi is still alive nearly a year later, and news reports in recent days have questioned whether he was as sick as depicted.  Questions also have been raised about whether a deal was cut to release him to protect British business interests in Libya, with oil giant BP exerting influence in the case. The Scottish government has insisted that BP never lobbied to free al Megrahi. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and four U.S. senators from New York and New Jersey have called for Britain to revisit the case, even though there is little chance that al Megrahi will be returned to custody from his native Libya. Cameron was scheduled to meet with the senators during his visit to Washington. Obama said most Americans were ""surprised, disappointed and angry"" about the decision to let al Megrahi go. ""We should have all the facts,"" he added. ""They should be laid out there."" The decision ""ran contrary to how we should be treating terrorists."" Turning to BP's responsibilities after the Gulf oil spill, Cameron said he ""completely understands"" the anger that exists ""across America."" ""It is BP's role to cap the leak, to clean up the mess, and to pay appropriate compensation,"" he said.  ""I'm in regular touch with senior management at BP, and the president is, too, to make sure that happens."" The two men said they were united in their goals for the Afghanistan war and in terms of preventing Tehran's acquisition of nuclear weapons. Cameron, however, remains under pressure at home to end the British involvement in the Afghan campaign. Britain is the second-largest contributor of troops to the military coalition fighting Taliban insurgents, behind only the United States. Obama also indicated they had both reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal responsibility in light of spiraling deficits in the major Western economies.  At the same time, the president stressed that different countries are taking slightly different approaches, depending on their specific circumstances. Obama has pushed for the need for greater stimulus spending in the short term while addressing deficits as more of a long-term issue; Cameron entered office pledging the enactment of immediate austerity measures. In keeping with those measures, his office said earlier, the prime minister flew on a commercial flight to Washington. While their different approaches to the economic crisis underscore their different political orientations, Obama and Cameron, according to many observers, also have a great deal in common. Among other things, they're a similar age -- Cameron is 43 and Obama is 48 -- and they both campaigned on the slogan of hope and change. Cameron came to power in May in a historic change of government in the United Kingdom, about 18 months after Obama made history with his own election as the United States' first African-American president. The two men bet a bottle of beer on the outcome of the USA-England soccer match in the first round of the World Cup, and exchanged bottles in a lighthearted event when the teams tied 1-1 in June.

"(Mashable) -- It takes longer to read books on a Kindle 2 or an iPad versus a printed book, Jakob Nielsen of product development consultancy Nielsen Norman Group discovered in a recent usability survey. The study found that reading speeds declined by 6.2 percent on the iPad and 10.7 percent on theKindle compared to print. However, Nielsen conceded that the differences in reading speed between the two devices were not ""statistically significant because of the data's fairly high variability"" -- in other words, the study did not prove that the iPad allowed for faster reading than the Kindle. A total of 24 participants (10 is about average for a usability survey) were given short stories by Ernest Hemingway to read in print and oniPads, Kindles and desktop PCs. Hemingway was chosen because his work utilizes simple language and is ""pleasant and engaging to read."" The narratives took an average of 17 minutes and 20 seconds from start to finish -- enough time to get readers fully ""immersed"" in the stories, Nielsen explained. After reading, participants filled out a brief comprehension questionnaire to make sure no one had skimmed through a story. Users rated their satisfaction with each device; the iPad, Kindle and printed book scored 5.8, 5.7 and 5.6, on a scale of 7, respectively, while the PC received an average score of 3.6 -- due, in part, because reading on a PC reminded readers of work. Participants also complained about the weight of the iPad and the Kindle's weak contrast. As Nielsen notes, the satisfaction ratings on the survey are promising for the future of e-readers and tablet devices. However, I can see universities and businesses taking less kindly to e-readers if further studies prove that they handicap reading speed. What do you think of the results?

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A much-anticipated meeting Tuesday between military officers of the U.S.-led U.N. Command and North Korea in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea has been postponed, the command said. A new meeting time was not immediately proposed, the command said. They planned to discuss the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan. The U.N. officers were slated to be U.S. colonels, as the United States holds responsibility for U.N. security forces in Korea. North Korea had accepted a U.N. proposal for the meeting of colonel-level leaders to be a precursor to talks between generals on the contentious naval incident. The demilitarized zone was created as part of the armistice signed between North and South Korea in 1953 that halted the Korean War, but the war has never officially ended. The United Nations and North Korea began occasional meetings between generals -- ""General Officer Talks"" -- at Panmunjom in 1998 to lessen tensions. There have been 16 such meetings to date, the last one in March 2009, the United Nations said. On Friday, the United Nations formally condemned the sinking of the Cheonan but did not specifically name North Korea, which an international joint civilian-military investigation deemed culpable. Australia, Britain, the United States, Sweden and South Korea provided experts for the inquiry. ""The Security Council deplores the attack,"" the 15-member council said Friday in what is known as a presidential statement. It urged that ""appropriate and peaceful measures be taken against those responsible for the incident aimed at the peaceful settlement of the issue."" It also called for full adherence to the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement, which ended hostilities in the Korean War. Despite the absence of North Korea's name in the condemnation, Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the message to the communist nation is ""unmistakable."" ""This statement is notable and it is clear,"" Rice said after its approval at a Friday session. ""It uses the term 'attack' repeatedly, which you don't have to be a scholar of the English language to understand is not a neutral term."" South Korea welcomed the statement. ""I think it's crystal clear that [the] Security Council made it clear that North Korea [is] to be blamed and to be condemned,"" said Park In-kook, South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations. A presidential statement, unlike a Security Council resolution, is not legally binding, though it requires approval of the council's five permanent members: China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and United States. The Security Council expressed ""deep sympathy and condolences"" for the deaths of 46 sailors aboard the Cheonan. The isolated North has maintained its innocence, rejecting the investigation findings outright, questioning the validity of the experts involved, asking to conduct its own inquiry and telling the Security Council that North Korea is the true victim of a conspiracy. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, called the presidential statement ""devoid of any proper judgment,"" according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency on Friday. He added the case ""should have been settled between the North and the South without referring it to the U.N. The DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to probe the truth about the case to the last.""","Officers were to discuss sinking of South Korean warship .

"Dallas, Texas(CNN) -- Financial troubles and despair over her husband's death were weighing heavily on the mayor of a Texas city who apparently killed herself and her daughter last week, her close friend told CNN. ""I think that the weight of it all became too much for her,"" said Doug Stover, who preceded Jayne Peters as mayor of Coppell, Texas. ""She felt unfortunately, for her, this was the only option she had."" Police in Coppell said last week that Peters shot and killed her 19-year-old daughter before turning the gun on herself. In an interview with CNN's Don Lemon on Saturday, Stover described Peters as ""a very anti-gun person"" and said she had borrowed the gun from a friend, claiming she needed it for a self-defense class. ""The way she died and the ways she behaved in the last days of her life were not characteristic of the way she lived,"" he said. CNN affiliate KTXA reported that Peters faced foreclosure on her home at least twice this year. Ultimately, according to the Foreclosure Listing Service, the home was not foreclosed on, KTXA said. Coppell City Manager Clay Phillips told the affiliate that the city was looking into expenditures charged to Peters' city-issued credit card to see if there were any financial improprieties. Stover said close friends only learned of Peters' financial struggles after her death. ""She never opened up to anybody about her own problems,"" he said. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's Officer ruled Wednesday that the mayor's death was a suicide and her daughter's a homicide. Police found Peters, 55, and her daughter Mary Corinne Peters, 19, Tuesday evening after city officials asked them to check on the family's welfare when the mayor did not show up for a scheduled council meeting. An envelope containing a note and a key to the two-story house had been left on the front door. Three other notes were found inside the house. The outside note warned officers of what they would find inside, The Dallas Morning News reported. One of the suicide notes said that her 19-year-old daughter hid her pain from her friends, according to The Dallas Morning News, and that mother and daughter ""were lost, alone and afraid."" Police told the News the notes gave no clues as to what led to the shooting, but rather provided instructions on, among other things, how to care for the family's pets. Two dogs were found in the house, the newspaper reported. Peters was elected mayor in May 2009 and had been a member of the city council since 1998. Her husband died of cancer in January 2008. Coppell, 16 miles northwest of Dallas, has a population of 39,000. CNN's Don Lemon contributed to this report.","Friend says pressure of financial problems was too much for Mayor Jayne Peters .

"(CNN) -- Police have identified the body of a missing mother found Sunday in a vacant lot in Camden, New Jersey. A family member found the body of Jenna Lord, 23, of Collingdale, Pennsylvania, on Sunday in a vacant lot in Camden, according to Jason Laughlin, a spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor's Office. Family members and police had been searching the area. Lord, described as a formerly troubled young woman who had recently begun to turn her life around, went missing over the July Fourth weekend. She was last seen the morning of July 5, waiting for a train home to Pennsylvania at the Walter Rand Transportation Center in Camden after attending a Fourth of July gathering the night before, according to her mother, Desiree Caruso. Her body was dressed in the same clothes she was wearing when she went missing, Laughlin reported. Caruso told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that her daughter's cell phone had died sometime over the weekend, and she used a man's phone at the train station to call her mother. Caruso said she missed the phone call, but talked with the man afterward, who told her that her daughter ""looked a little scared."" The man told Caruso that he helped Lord buy a train ticket and waited with her until his train arrived. ""His train came a minute before hers, and he got on his train and I guess he figured she would get on her train, but she never got home,"" Caruso said. The man also said that Lord had been approached by another man, who told him he would make sure she got on her train, saying, ""I got this,"" according to Caruso. Surveillance video apparently shows Lord walking around the train station with two men following ""about 5 feet"" behind her, according to Caruso, who had seen the footage. ""It looked like they were saying something to her,"" Caruso said of the tape. ""She looked back and then she just kept walking, and that's the end [of the tape]."" The Camden, Gloucester and Salem County medical examiner said the cause of death is undetermined due to the body's heavy state of decomposition, but there's no evidence of foul play, Laughlin said in a written statement. Investigators aren't able to conduct toxicology tests but are looking into whether other tests could determine how Lord died, Laughlin said. Collingdale, Pennsylvania, Police Chief Robert Adams said Lord was reported missing from his town. Adams said the young mother attended a party in New Jersey and never returned home. The family has said police were not helpful in searching for Lord. But Adams disputes that and said the case involved four jurisdictions and two states. Adams said Lord, who has a young son, was scheduled to appear in court this week on charges of aggravated assault and theft in a neighboring town. She had not gone missing before, he said. ""This is not the conclusion I was not hoping for. I was hoping she'd be found in rehab or found alive and well,"" he added. Lord's family has said police were hesitant to get involved because of her criminal past: She was arrested in 2006 for possession of marijuana and was arrested on assault charges earlier this year, Delaware County court records show. But Caruso said Lord has been clean for six months, and had been reading the Bible daily and concentrating on being a mother to her 3-year-old son. Camden Police Chief John Scott Thomson said in a statement Monday that his department ""worked closely"" with Lord's family in the search for Lord. ""In addition to investigative efforts and continuous radio police broadcasts, Camden City police officers were on foot, distributing flyers and searching with family members during yesterday's discovery,"" Thomson said. ""The Camden Police Department is assisting the Camden County Prosecutor's Office with the investigation into Jenna's cause of death.""","Jenna Lord, 23, of Pennsylvania, was missing for two weeks .

"Walnut Creek, California (CNN) -- Dueling rallies took place Monday involving a former Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed passenger. Several hundred people gathered in this suburban community, some 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, with supporters of former officer Johannes Mehserle joined by critics, who said they were calling for justice for his victim, Oscar Grant. The Walnut Creek branch of the Contra Costa County Superior Court closed early Monday because of the rallies, and all cases that were scheduled to be heard Monday afternoon were postponed. Some gas stations and a restaurant in the area also opted to close down for the day. From the air, the crowd appeared to be mostly peaceful, although banners revealed a sharp divide. ""Jail All Racist Killer Cops,"" proclaimed one large banner, held aloft by several people. Other banners proclaimed support  for police. ""Free Mehserle,"" some said. The Justice for Oscar Grant supporters started their demonstration across the street but then moved onto the sidewalk in front the courthouse where the Mehserle supporters were demonstrating. There was some shouting between the two sides. Police in riot gear placed metal barriers to keep the two sides apart. The two groups appeared evenly matched in size. Police said at its peak, there appeared to be about 300 people at the event. They said there were no arrests. ""The crowd has been vocal but very cooperative,"" Walnut Creek police Lt. Steve Skinner said. ""There were no acts of violence. It actually went very well on both sides."" The crowds dispersed after about four hours. The Walnut Creek police department called in most of its police personnel and civilian staff for duty, and the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office helped provide security. Some area departments helped direct traffic. Mehserle, who is white, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of Grant, an unarmed black man who was on a train platform at the Fruitvale station in nearby Oakland. The area gets its name from the apricot and cherry orchards that abounded there more than a century ago. Supporters of Mehserle say the killing was a ""tragic mistake"" and say they called the rally to show support for police. They helped spread word for the rally through Facebook. ""Anyone who supports Johannes and our Law Enforcement Officers may attend,"" said a post on the Facebook page.  ""This is a PEACEFUL rally to show our support for Johannes, his family and our law enforcement officers."" It added, ""This rally is NOT about inciting violence, destruction, intolerance, hatred, racism, riots or to upset the Grant family."" But organizers of the counter-rally say they were standing up for justice for Grant and against racism. They said in a news release they want to make clear that ""justice means that Grant's killer, Mehserle, stays in jail and they throw away the key."" The website for the Justice for Oscar Grant Committee added, ""Oscar Grant was a young Black man returning home by way of the Fruitvale BART station after celebrating the New Year. This was the only excuse the cop needed to end Grant's life execution-style. Maybe Oscar was too loud, too proud, too Black. Maybe he was too calm during the taunts of the police. Or maybe it was for nothing at all."" Mehserle faces two to four years in prison at his scheduled August 6 sentencing. He remains in the Los Angles County jail. The judge could also impose an additional term of three, four or 10 years because a firearm was used in the crime. Although police said they were prepared for possible clashes, some people in this normally placid town were not unduly concerned that the rallies might get out of control, even though protests after the verdict in nearby Oakland led to the arrest of 78 people. ""Even though I don't think it's the best idea, because I think it's inflammatory, it's people's right,"" said Sue Klingler. ""I work across the street from the Superior Court, and I'm not concerned at all."" Another man, who didn't give his name to CNN affiliate KRON-TV, said that Walnut Creek ""is not known for getting outrageous types of demonstrations."" The January 1, 2009, shooting of the 22-year-old Grant was captured on a bystander's cell phone video camera. The video was widely circulated on the internet and on news broadcasts. The video showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. Mehserle testified that the shooting was an accident and that he had mistakenly used his handgun instead of his Taser. Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale. The earlier Oakland demonstrations were called in response to Mehserle's acquittal on second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter charges. The Oakland demonstrations began peacefully but were followed by some violence, including vandalism.","NEW: Police Lt. says crowds were vocal but orderly .

"(CNN) -- The boyfriend of a missing Arizona woman is being held without bond on fraud and other charges while police seek additional information into his girlfriend's disappearance, Chandler police said Tuesday. Jamie Laiaddee went missing from the home she shares with her boyfriend in the early morning hours of March 18, police said. At first, friends and family didn't think too much about the lapse in communication with their loved one -- the 32-year-old Laiaddee usually got in touch with them every few weeks and it was not uncommon for her to go months without calling her parents, according to Chandler police spokesman Sgt. Joe Favazzo. It wasn't until 10 weeks later, on May 28, that Laiaddee's father officially reported her missing to police after learning of his daughter's disappearance from her boyfriend of three years -- identified by Chandler police and friends as Bryan Stewart. Upon searching the couple's home, authorities found Laiaddee's car, purse, keys and other personal effects. As part of their investigation, authorities also discovered that Stewart had been living under a false name for the past eight years. His real name is Rick Wayne Valentini and he is 41, Favazzo said. Court documents refer to Valentini by his assumed name. Stewart was apprehended by police at a Scottsdale apartment after investigators learned he had an outstanding traffic-related arrest warrant. When he was found, he was ""in possession of a vehicle owned by Jamie,"" according to police. Stewart, who police said is the last person to see Laiaddee, told investigators that he and Laiaddee had an argument on March 17 and broke up after she told him she was taking a new job in Denver, Colorado, Favazzo said. ""At this point we have no evidence whatsoever to indicate Jamie"" planned to leave, ""and certainly not to Colorado,"" Favazzo said. Police said Stewart had been driving Laiaddee's car and using her credit cards in the weeks after her disappearance. He is being held without bond in the Maricopa County jail on charges of credit card fraud, theft of credit cards, probation violation, identity theft, weapons violations and an outstanding warrant, according to police. ""Investigators are now focusing on Stewart/Valentini as a person of interest in the disappearance of Jamie Laiaddee,"" according to a Chandler Police Department news release about the case. Favazzo said Tuesday that police ""don't believe Jamie just dropped off the grid."" ""We suspect foul play at this point and we fear that she could be dead,"" he said, adding that authorities are imploring the public for any leads to Laiaddee's whereabouts. Friends of Laiaddee's who have set up a Facebook page to raise awareness about her disappearance describe the 1999 University of Michigan graduate as ""bubbly,"" ""outgoing"" and ""fiercely loyal.""

"(CNN) -- Presidents need a break. Really. President Bush, shown playing horseshoes in 2004, also enjoys mountain biking. In long days scheduled in 15-minute increments, presidents are asked to make decisions affecting millions -- sometimes life-or-death decisions. ""When you get to the Oval Office, there are no easy decisions,"" says Kenneth Duberstein, who was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. ""Any decision that reaches the president's desk is a close call. It's not black and white. It's shades of gray."" Presidents work best when they take regular respites from the burdens of the presidency, according to Duberstein and other White House insiders from the Nixon presidency through the current administration. ""The time off at the ranch or at Camp David was more than an escape,"" Duberstein says. ""It was good for his physical and mental well-being."" ""The daily routine of a president is really grueling,"" says Ron Nessen, press secretary to President Gerald Ford. ""It's hard to get thinking time. Ford talked about how when he was swimming laps, it gave him time to think about things.""  See what presidents have enjoyed doing in their free time Â» . Anecdotal evidence from the previous seven administrations jibes with research into decision making. Keith Sawyer, a professor of psychology, education and business at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, says good ideas come from a combination of hard work and down time. ""Creativity researchers have discovered that there is a cycle. It is very difficult to have a good idea when you're working all out. It typically happens when you take time away,"" says Sawyer, author of ""Group Genius: The Creative Power of Collaboration."" ""The unconscious mind is really good at bouncing different ideas together,"" he says. ""That's where creative insight comes from. When you're working hard, you're basically blocking the unconscious mind from doing that work."" No wonder then, that the most recent presidents have turned to sports as a diversion from what's been called the toughest job in the world. Presidents have enjoyed mountain biking (George W. Bush), golf (Bill Clinton, Ford, Dwight D. Eisenhower), tennis (Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush), jogging (Clinton, Carter and both Bushes), swimming (Ford), bowling (Richard Nixon), horseshoes (George H.W. Bush) and horseback riding (Reagan). ""Exercise was a huge part of his life,"" says Jody Powell, Carter's press secretary. ""He enjoyed tennis very much. He ran just about every day."" To blow off steam, Clinton would go to the putting green outside the White House. ""Everyone knew to leave him alone,"" says Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart. ""It had to be a national security crisis to go out and interrupt him."" Even presidents who were not particularly athletic made a point of taking a break.  Coming this weekend: Fit to Lead Â» . President Nixon had an office with a comfortable sofa in the Old Executive Office Building (now the Eisenhower Executive Office Building), next door to the White House, says John Dean, former White House counsel. ""He would go over there and stretch out and get a couple hours reading or taking a nap if he was inclined, and that was built into the schedule,"" Dean says. Early in his administration, Clinton worked too hard and his decision making suffered as a result, according to Lockhart. ""The first term, particularly the first couple of years, the president kind of set his own schedule and he worked from very early in the morning until very late at night. And he wore himself out, and I would argue, his decision-making ability was not nearly as good as it was in his second term,"" Lockhart says. When Ford came down with the flu, he was forced to take four days in the residence. ""His workload was cut way back so he had more time to think, and he came back and decided to make some major, major changes to his staff,"" Nessen says. An avid runner, mountain biker and fisherman, ""President Bush is good at finding ways to separate [from the job],"" says Ari Fleischer, his former press secretary. ""But even so, you never have an uninterrupted day as president. Every day, you have a National Security Council meeting. Every day you get interrupted by an intelligence briefing."" No matter how the president chooses to unwind, the enormous burdens of the job are never far away. ""Even in moments when you're physically trying to relax in whatever outlet you have, you have a member of the military within 15 feet with nuclear codes,"" Lockhart said. ""That kind of takes the fun out of whatever sport you're into.""","Experts: Presidents work best when they take regular breaks from the job .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Some of the Roma deported from France said Friday they plan to return as soon as possible. They flew Thursday to Romania on a French flight, the first of several scheduled to take Roma out of France in the coming days. The French government says the deportations are part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. They follow the government's dismantling in the past three weeks of 51 Roma camps that it called illegal. Roma in Europe: Persecuted and misunderstood . ""Over there, they were giving us food, money ... salary. Life is much better out there -- happier,"" Mariana Serban, a mother of four, told Romania's Realitatea TV. She told the reporter she did not work in France, and smiled when the reporter pointed out France would not give them any more money. ""That's what they say now, but they will give us money again,"" Serban said. Serban's oldest son, Alexandru, 12, spoke in French as he told the TV station, ""It's much better in France. I'm here now for a visit, and I will leave again. I'm staying here for two days only."" The Thursday flight carried 79 Roma out of the country, French officials said. Friday's flight, due to land in the Romanian city of Timisoara in the afternoon, had 132 Roma aboard, according to the office of Valentin Mocanu, Romania's secretary of state for Roma integration. French officials earlier said the third flight would happen Saturday, but the Romanian Foreign Ministry said it would take place August 26 and carry 159 Roma. The ministry said there will also be two flights next month, carrying 27 Roma from France to Romania. France offered 300 euros ($384) to each Roma adult and 100 euros ($128) to each Roma child who accepted the offer for a ""voluntary return."" The comments by the returning Roma may dash any French hopes that they will resume their former lives in Romania. ""They will go and meet their parents and other relatives, and after that they will return to France, I'm telling you,"" Adrian Edu, an expert on Roma issues with the Bucharest City Hall, told PRO TV. Roma are a group of people who live mainly in southern and eastern Europe, often in poverty. Commonly referred to as Gypsies, they tend to live in camps, caravans, or informal settlements and have been the target of persecution throughout history. Romanian President Traian Basescu said in a statement Thursday that his country would try to find a solution to the French situation. ""We understand the problems Roma camps create around French cities, and we will work with France to find suitable solutions,"" he said. Roma from Romania and Bulgaria are allowed free passage into France if they are European Union citizens. After that, however, they must find work, start studies, or find some other way of becoming established in France or risk deportation. The French government said those Roma being deported this week have overstayed the three-month limit. Two Romanian secretaries of state plan to be in Paris on August 30 to discuss the integration of Roma populations, the French Foreign Ministry said. It said Paris favors the social integration of the Roma in Romania. Mocanu's office said local authorities try to integrate the returning Roma into the workforce, offering jobs to those who come back. Roma are not obligated to accept the job offers, however, and most of the time they don't, resulting in their return to the country from where they came, the office said. CNN's Sarah Goddard in Paris, France, and Journalist Cosmin Stan in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this report.","Roma deported to Romania say they will return to France .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan man and woman were convicted Thursday of trying to extort $680,000 from ""Full House"" actor John Stamos by threatening to sell compromising photos that prosecutors say were never found. Scott Edward Sippola, 31, and Allison Lenore Coss, 24, could face up to nine years in prison for convictions of conspiracy and interstate communications to extort money, said assistant U.S. Attorney Maarten Vermaat. Sentencing is set for October 8. ""The case was made by the fact that these defendants made threats to damage his [Stamos'] reputation in order to have him pay them,"" Vermaat said after the verdict in Marquette, Michigan. Jurors deliberated for about five hours Thursday. According to CNN affiliate WLUC,  prosecutors said that Coss and Sippola demanded $680,000 from the television actor or they would sell embarrassing pictures to tabloid publications of Stamos allegedly using drugs. Vermaat said the defendants sent about 40 e-mails to Stamos threatening to sell the photos. FBI agents got involved and started monitoring Stamos' e-mail account and ""eventually communicated by cellular telephone with the defendants pretending to be Mr. Stamos' business manager."" Sippola and Coss were arrested in December 2009 at an airport, a pre-arranged drop off spot for the money. Defense attorney Sarah Henderson alleged at trial that Stamos had a fling with Coss when she was a 17-year-old vacationing on spring break in 2004. Prosecutors said Stamos met Coss during a trip to Disney World in Orlando, Florida. They developed a friendship and the two communicated by e-mail occasionally until November 2009, when the actor turned the photos matter over to the FBI. According to WLUC, Coss testified there were several photos depicting Stamos using cocaine. She claimed the actor seemed interested in buying the photos. The actor testified that nothing inappropriate happened at a 2004 spring-break party and, accordingly, he didn't believe compromising photos existed. Stamos said Thursday he wants to get back to work. ""I would like to thank the court, the FBI and the U.S .Attorney's office for their swift and efficient dealings in connection with this case,"" Stamos said in a statement Thursday afternoon. ""I am shocked and perplexed how individuals could fabricate so many false stories in an effort to defend a crime. I agreed to be a witness for a federal criminal prosecution and endured countless false accusations about my behavior and appropriateness. The allegations made regarding an inappropriate relationship are completely untrue. These slanderous allegations to smear my reputation were part of their defense to redirect attention away from the federal crime of extortion. There was no hot tub, no drugs, no nudity and nothing sexual in nature involved in my friendship with this woman. They lied about everything from a pregnancy to compromising photos."" A call by CNN to defense attorney Sarah Henderson was not immediately returned.","Michigan woman, man convicted of trying to extort money from actor John Stamos .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Setting one species up to scare off or even kill another is nothing new. One of the world's most fearsome killers? Me? The heart-stoppingly infamous cane toad. Toads, bees, mongoose and even moths have all been utilized with varying degrees of success over the years in the hope that they could do the job humans couldn't. Sometimes it works, frequently it doesn't, and in some cases we are still waiting to find out. If any of these following examples teaches us anything at all, it is that if you are going to play with Nature, you do so at your own peril. Click here for gallery Â» . The Cane Toad . Who would have thought a humble toad could end up as the killer of one of the world's most fearsome creatures, the crocodile? It all started off so innocently, too. Introduced to Australia in 1935 from Hawaii, the cane toad, which is native to Central and South America, was supposed to kill off the scarab beetles that were decimating Australian sugarcane crops. Unfortunately, the toads failed to go after the beetles and decided to multiply at a very fast rate instead (they can lay between 8,000 and 30,000 eggs in one go) ending up as another pest the Australians were keen to see the back of. According to the Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH), the cane toad ""expanded through Australia's northern landscape at 27-50 kilometers a year"" and is now heading south at a rate of 1.3 kilometers a year. Cane toads not only eat pretty much anything that can fit in their mouths, but as of yet, no known predators or diseases have been identified that can take them on. The problem is that they are extremely toxic, with the DEH stating ""almost anything that eats the toad dies rapidly from heart failure"". And that includes crocodiles. According to the University of Sydney, crocodile populations that have come across these new pests have been dropping like flies, in some places by as much as 77 percent. Small Indian mongoose . The risk with hired killers is that sometimes they can be a bit too good at their job. Such is the case with the small Indian mongoose, which was introduced into Hawaii and some of its surrounding islands in 1883. The idea was the mongoose, a ""voracious and opportunistic predator,"" according to Columbia University, would keep rats out of the sugarcane fields, where they had been feasting on what was on offer. The mongooses came in and missed out on the rats, as the former happened to be day-lovers, while the latter was nocturnal. So they turned their attention to other species instead, including birds (specifically ground nesters), small mammals and reptiles (they particularly liked snakes and iguanas). Little did the Hawaiians know at the time, but the small Indian mongoose is one of the world's most fearsome killers, now listed by the World Conservation Union in the top 100 of the world's worst invaders. These tiny creatures have hunted several species to extinction, including, says Columbia University, at least seven types of amphibians and reptiles in the West Indies; and in Jamaica alone it has been responsible for the extinction of a lizard, a snake, a rat and two birds. In Hawaii, the endangered Hawaiian crow, the endangered dark-rumped petrel and the nene goose are now all at risk, thanks to the appetite of this tiny, furry creature. And to make matters worse, this particular mongoose is a vector for rabies too. The English sparrow . The early bird catches the worm, but if that bird is an English sparrow, it does a little more than that, as the Americans found out in 1850. It was then that the bird was intentionally introduced to the U.S. as a means of protecting trees from canker worms. But according to Cornell University, the sparrow also set about feasting on crops as well. The sparrow had a very varied appetite, feeding on wheat, oats, corn and barley, pretty much any vegetable or fruit it laid its eyes on and it had a taste for chicken feed too. Surprisingly for its size, the sparrow is also a fairly aggressive creature and proved a bit of a bully to the locals, ""displacing some native birds and harassing others"", says Cornell. To add insult to injury, it carried 29 diseases that infected both humans and livestock. While U.S. populations are now largely on the decline, according to the Global Invasive Species Database, Australia meanwhile is on high alert, with the bird now having been assigned as ""an extreme threat category"" there. The red Fox . Australia has an unenviable claim to fame: it is home to the most number of mammal extinctions in the world. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), nearly half of all mammals that have gone extinct in the last 200 years, have been Australian. And much of the responsibility for these extinctions rests on the shoulders of introduced predators like the red fox. Just on its own the red fox could be responsible for ""dozens of small mammal extinctions"" in the country, according to Columbia University. The English brought the red fox with them to the country in 1855, not only introducing it for a spot of hunting, but also, it is thought, to control the brown hare populations. Unfortunately, the red fox was an excellent predator but it liked chasing after more types of creatures than just the brown hare. It had a ball, as Australian wildlife just wasn't equipped to deal with it. As a result, it freely preyed on birds, mammals of varying sizes and reptiles. It particularly seemed to like newborn lambs, goat kids and chickens, creating an economic headache for local farmers. And it didn't take them too long to spread either -- according to Australia's DEH, it took the red fox just 100 years to inhabit almost the entire continent. A natural scavenger, the red fox is incredibly adaptable too, which has meant not only has it proliferated on a massive scale, but with the absence of any real predators to speak of, they have proven very difficult indeed to kill. The European red fox is often described as Australia's number one predator; and as its also a ""key carrier of rabies"", says Columbia, the red fox is up there amongst Australia's most unwelcome guests.

"Washington (CNN) -- The top lawyer for the Pentagon tried to talk to an attorney who said he represented the WikiLeaks website on Sunday, August 15, but the attorney never showed for the 10 a.m. telephone call, according to a Defense Department spokesman. Late Wednesday, the Pentagon released a letter from Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson to Timothy J. Matusheski, an attorney in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the letter was being released because of inaccurate public statements by WikiLeaks that the Pentagon had contact with the website. ""Today because of the misrepresentations that have been made public, we have released this letter that we sent to this individual,"" Whitman said. WikiLeaks told some news outlets that the Army is willing to consider working with WikiLeaks to review classified documents that were leaked and will soon be posted online by the website. Whitman insisted that direct contact had not been made. ""We don't consider that there has been any direct contact. We came across an individual that purported -- I'm not going to get into details -- to be an attorney for WikiLeaks. We arranged for a conversation to take place that he was a no-show."" But the attorney told CNN that's a lie. ""I never agreed to that,"" Matusheski said. ""This guy -- Jeh Charles Johnson -- he's never called me ever. I never agreed to be available by telephone on the morning of Sunday. August 15th. If they had asked me I would have made myself available, I was sleeping."" In the August 16 letter, Johnson said, ""I understand that you represent yourself to be an attorney for Wikileaks and that you, on behalf of that organization, sought a conversation with someone in the US government to discuss 'harm minimization"" with respect to some 15,000 classified documents that Wikileaks is holding and is threatening to make public. In response, I was prepared to speak with you, yesterday at 10:00 a.m. EDT and convey the position of the Department of Defense. Despite your agreement to be available by telephone yesterday morning, we could not reach you at that time."" When reached by phone, Matusheski told CNN he received phone calls from a man who said he was an Army investigator. That man, according to Matusheski, did suggest a conversation about WikiLeaks but that was in a voice mail message that Matuskeski said he did not hear until well after 10 a.m. Sunday. He said he has not heard from the man since. CNN attempted to talk to the individual in question who referred CNN to the Army investigation unit media spokesman. Matusheski said he contacted the FBI a few weeks ago when he learned they were looking for WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange because Matusheski was concerned his name would come up and he would get a ""surprise visit"" from the bureau. He said he did get a phone call back from the FBI but that all subsequent contact has been with the man who said he was an Army investigator. Matusheski told CNN he has done pro bono work for WikiLeaks since 2007, and he considers himself an attorney for the website. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the government's position remains firm that it will not negotiate with WikiLeaks. He could not explain what the Pentagon was in fact prepared to discuss with the attorney.","WikiLeaks has said it plans to post thousands more leaked documents .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Rolling Stone magazine journalist whose article about Gen. Stanley McChrystal helped end the Afghanistan commander's career has been denied permission to embed with a military unit in Afghanistan, a Pentagon spokesman told CNN Wednesday. ""Embeds are a privilege, not a right. The unit decided they didn't feel the trust necessary for an embed. They declined,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said, not specifying which unit was involved. Michael Hastings, the reporter, said via Twitter that his embed had earlier been approved, then was ""disapproved."" McChrystal's illustrious career came to an abrupt end when he resigned after he and his staff were quoted in a Hastings article criticizing and mocking key Obama administration officials. The Army is investigating the circumstances that led to the article, an Army spokesman told CNN Wednesday. ""A four-star commander was relieved ultimately due to this article. We want to understand what happened here,"" Col. Tom Collins said. The Army Inspector General, the service's independent investigative arm, began the investigation shortly after President Barack Obama fired the general in June, Collins said Wednesday. He declined to answer questions about the scope of the review or who was being interviewed, because the investigation is ongoing. It is widely believed that McChrystal, as well as his closest aides, either may have already been interviewed or will be by the inspector general regarding comments in the article that could be considered denigrating to the president. McChrystal himself, however, is not expected to be a target of the investigation as the president has already said he did not fire the general ""out of any sense of personal insult."" Obama said he was making the decision because the tone of the remarks made in the article ""undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system."" Under the code of military justice, it is illegal to make disrespectful remarks about the president, but the inspector general's investigation is not a criminal one. The investigation was formally ordered by Army Vice Chief of Staff General Peter Chiarelli, who is responsible for disciplinary matters in the Army. Several Defense Department officials contacted by CNN said they had been unaware of the investigation until it was reported this week by the Associated Press. Hastings, the Rolling Stone reporter, is not cooperating with the investigation. He said on Twitter he ""refused to participate."" Obama tapped McChrystal in June 2009 to be the top commander in Afghanistan. The general was known for his discretion and keeping the media at arm's length, a perception that was shattered when the infamous Rolling Stone article came out in June. McChrystal did not directly criticize Obama in the article, but reporter Hastings writes that the general and Obama ""failed from the outset to connect"" after the president took office. Sources familiar with their first meeting said McChrystal thought Obama looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the room full of top military officials, according to the article. The journalist wrote that an unnamed aide to McChrystal mocked Vice President Joe Biden. McChrystal did not deny the article's accuracy. In a statement, he called the comments ""a mistake"" and apologized for ""poor judgment."" He retired June 23 and was replaced by Gen. David Petraeus, who was previously the top commander in Iraq.

"(CNN) -- After being an avid iPhone user for two years, I finally gave up. A couple of weeks ago I picked up my first Android phone: an HTC Droid Incredible, offered through Verizon Wireless. I'd owned my iPhone for two years and for the most part liked it. Having a smartphone improved my life and work in several ways. But my contract was up and I'd moved to the Bay Area -- where I've found AT&T's 3G network to be ridiculously spotty and slow. (Each month I felt like I was paying for the emperor's new clothes.) As I considered my phone options, the unicorn of a non-AT&T iPhone continued to waver maddeningly in the mists of the uncertain future. Furthermore, even legal iPhone jailbreaking looks like more of a headache than I would want to deal with. It was definitely time for a change. Over the last year I'd been demoing various Android phones, to see what I'd be in for if I switched. With Android 2.1, I felt like the OS had finally reached a level of usability and stability I could get comfortable with on a daily basis. I'm not averse to learning a new mobile operating system -- but it's definitely not on my top-10 list of fun stuff to do. As I expected, there was a considerable learning curve, many decisions and tradeoffs, occasional confusion and frustration, and some things about my Android phone I just don't like but will have to tolerate. (That's pretty much the experience I had when I first got my iPhone, by the way.) Here are some lessons from my iPhone-to-Android switch, which might be useful to others contemplating a similar move: . Set aside a day to learn your phone If your smartphone is an integral part of how you conduct your life and work, take some time up front to focus. Even if you've demoed Android phones before, configuring it for your personal use and figuring out which new habits you should adopt requires time and focus. Don't expect to dive in and in an hour be as comfortable with your Android phone as you were with your iPhone. Get your apps through AppBrain.com This site, and its Android app, helps you discover apps in the Android Market and manage them on your phone. It also makes it easier to update and restore all your apps. (These tasks are easy on the iPhone via iTunes, but tedious if you get your apps straight from the Android Market.) AppBrain will only update, sync, and restore apps you've listed with your AppBrain account. So if you've already started getting crucial apps elsewhere, be sure to list them with your AppBrain account too. If you rely on iCal, you don't have to switch to Google Calendar It's enough to learn a new phone -- but it's even harder if you feel like this change means you also have to abandon lots of other tools you've come to rely on. I'm a heavy iCal user, and (after trying for a couple of hours) simply could not successfully import my iCal data into Google Calendar. So I found a solution to sync iCal up with my Droid Incredible. Instead of using the calendar app that came with my phone, I use a toolset from MarkSpace: Missing Sync ($40 for Mac software, free Android app) and Fliq Calendar (free Android app). In AndroidForums.com there's a useful review by Krischik of this toolset. Missing Sync will also sync contacts, photos, music, and more. Missing Sync is not perfect, however. I found it created many duplicate contacts on my phone, and it was unbearably slow for syncing media files -- but your mileage may vary. For me,Doubletwist works better for syncing music between my Mac and Droid Incredible. Carry a charger or spare battery All smartphones, but especially multitasking Android phones, can drain a battery fast. It's a good idea to learn tricks for minimizing power consumption on your phone. But until you learn those tricks, expect that your new phone could run out of power surprisingly fast. Charge your phone whenever your get a chance. The Kensington Portable Power Pack that I used for two years with my iPhone works just fine with my Droid Incredible -- which is good, since I've been getting lousy battery life from the Incredible, even worse than on my iPhone 3G. Accept that you'll have to let go of some treasured tools For years my main productivity tool has been OmniFocus -- pricey but excellent task-management software with a pricey but excellent iPhone app. Unfortunately, OmniFocus syncs only via Apple's MobileMe service, which really only plays nice with Apple devices. After trying several options, I decided to switch to the Web-based service Toodledo, which syncs with a pretty good free Android app, Got To Do Lite. This doesn't replace all the functionality of OmniFocus -- but for me, it will suffice. Again, your mileage may vary. ...All in all, after about three days of using my Droid Incredible I felt I was back up to a comparable level of mobile comfort and productivity. I'm still stumbling here and there, but for me the switching process was not especially daunting or stressful. Plus, it's really nice to finally get the high-speed mobile access I'm paying for. I expect someday Verizon's network will get bogged down here too -- but for me, for now, it's working great.","Take a day to learn your phone, because configuring it for your personal use  requires time .

"(CNN) -- A surprise appearance by WikiLeaks.org founder Julian Assange at the TED Global conference in Oxford, England, has cast new light on the activities of the site and its mysterious leader. Assange's site, which released video of a U.S. air strike in Iraq that killed a dozen civilians, claims to have revealed more classified intelligence documents than the rest of the world's media combined. Explaining during his appearance Friday why WikiLeaks has been keeping a lower profile since releasing the video, Assange said it was working on raising funds and strengthening its technical infrastructure to handle more traffic while accumulating ""an enormous quantity of whistle-blower disclosures."" He later told reporters that ""there are many things which are very explosive."" Assange, 39, said the site operates from several countries, including Sweden and Belgium, where laws provide more protection for its disclosures. He said he canceled plans to travel to the United States for three public appearances, citing what he described as indications that U.S. officials might not follow the ""rule of law"" in dealing with him. He also mentioned advice from investigative journalist Seymour Hersh to be cautious. He said U.S. officials have since adopted a more ""reasonable"" stance. TED Global is an annual conference hosted by the nonprofit organization TED, named after the three subjects it first began discussing in the 1980s: technology, entertainment and design. It has expanded its scope in the years since and its website now hosts more than 700 talks on a wide range of topics. Learn more about speakers at the TED Global conference . In an onstage discussion with TED curator Chris Anderson, Assange was asked whether is was true he had attended 37 schools as a child. He explained it was a consequence of two things: his parents were in the movie business and were later ""on the run from a cult."" Assange said he became a ""journalist activist"" in his teenage years and was prosecuted for it. According to political magazine Mother Jones: ""As a teenager in Melbourne, he belonged to a hacker collective called the International Subversives. He eventually pled guilty to 24 counts of breaking into Australian government and commercial websites to test their security gaps, but was released on bond for good behavior."" Asked about his core values, Assange said, ""Capable, generous men do not create victims, they nurture victims,"" attributing the thought to his father and others. ""I'm a combative person, so I'm not actually so big on the nurture, but there is another way of nurturing victims, which is to police perpetrators of crimes. And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time."" Read more about Assange and his site . Assange said the organization gets material from whistle-blowers in a variety of ways -- including postal mail. He said WikiLeaks vets it, releases it to the public and then defends itself against ""political or legal attack."" He said the organization rarely knows the identity of the source of the leak. ""If we find out at some stage, we destroy that information as soon as possible,"" he said. Pfc. Bradley E. Manning, 22, of Potomac, Maryland, has been charged with eight violations of the U.S. Criminal Code for allegedly illegally transferring classified data, including the video that wound up on WikiLeaks. He has been accused of ""wrongfully introducing a classified video of a military operation filmed at or near Baghdad, Iraq"" around July 12, 2007, ""onto his personal computer, a nonsecure information system."" Watch the video of the airstrike . Assange said at a news conference after his appearance Friday that Manning ""is a political prisoner being held in the nation of Kuwait, effectively keeping him away from the press and effective legal representation."" He said WikiLeaks is providing legal assistance to Manning without saying whether he was the source of the video. ""Obviously, we cannot pick and choose,"" said Assange, adding the site has to defend everyone who faces serious charges as a result of material posted on WikiLeaks. The video shows aerial footage of an attack by a U.S. Apache helicopter that killed civilians, including two journalists from the Reuters news service. WikiLeaks posted it in April. The site said the video ""clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers."" Asked to respond to Assange's assertion that Manning is a political prisoner, Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan told CNN last week that Manning is ""accused of committing serious offenses. He has been charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and will be processed by normal procedures through the military justice system."" U.S. military authorities have warned that the publication of classified documents on WikiLeaks could aid in the planning of terrorist attacks and harm national security. Assange denied reports that WikiLeaks had received hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. cables in addition to the Iraq video. He said the site would have released the cables if it had received them. Some information, such as private medical records, should be kept secret, Assange said, but he did not extend that view to classified documents. The fact that governments spend money to keep such information secret, Assange said, is a good indication that releasing the information can achieve reform. Anderson asked the audience for a show of hands as to whether he was a hero or a dangerous troublemaker. The vast majority signaled that they viewed him as a hero. CNN's Mike Mount and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","WikiLeaks.org founder Julian Assange makes rare public appearance .

"(CNN) -- As the mosque debate dominates the summer spin cycle, a new Pew Research Poll shows that an increasing number of Americans believe that Barack Obama is a Muslim -- now up to 18 percent from 11 percent in March 2009. At the same time, only a third of Americans say Obama is a Christian, down from nearly 50 percent last year. And while the biggest jumps in believing Obama is Muslim come from self-described conservative Republicans -- from 18 percent to 34 percent -- the number of Democrats who describe Obama as Christian fell from 55 percent to 46 percent. Independents -- while being the group least likely to want professions of religious beliefs from politicians -- have also fallen in with the drift. I believe the American people are smart. So what can account for this slippage from common sense to conspiracy theory? Obama made the story of his increasing commitment to Christianity a central tenet of his campaign character narrative; whole chapters were devoted to matters of faith in his book ""The Audacity of Hope."" But in the radioactive wake of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama left his longstanding church and has not yet found a new congregation. The absence of Obama attending Sunday services regularly has been a repeated ""just askin'..."" talking point on right wing news and radio -- and indeed, the Pew poll shows that most respondents got their ""views"" about Obama's religion from ""the media."" The meticulous attention that some liberals paid to George Bush's golf game is now directed at Obama hitting the links -- with the added subtext that he's playing when he should be praying. In the eyes of his opponents, Obama is an elitist silently laughing at those bitter Americans who cling to their guns and religion. The fact that an icon of the religious right like Ronald Reagan rarely attended Sunday services is ignored. But these poll numbers are also an ugly proxy for the campaign to convince the American people that their president is somehow ""other"" -- an ""Alien in the White House,"" as a Wall Street Journal editorial page headline called him recently. The birther myths build off this sense of Obama as a sinister fraud, casting Obama as not just anti-American in his beliefs but actually un-American and therefore not constitutionally eligible to be president. These conspiracy theories in turn build off chain e-mails that have been circulating since at least 2008, portraying Obama as a Muslim Marxist Manchurian Candidate determined to undermine the Republic from within -- a fright wing fantasy that has proliferated via the internet. Depressingly, a CNN poll  earlier this month found that 27 percent of all Americans believe that Obama was either definitely or probably not born in the USA -- a belief shared by 41 percent of Republicans. ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion,"" the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said, ""but not their own facts."" But the rise of partisan media means that Americans are self-segregating themselves into separate political realities where we can't even agree on basic facts like the president's religion and birthplace. While no responsible Republican would ever explicitly encourage these beliefs, there are plenty who delight in these poll findings because it presumably points to partisan gain. Truth is not as important as the pursuit of power in professional partisans' eyes, and dividing to conquer is a time-honored trick. Each president since at least Nixon has faced a concerted effort to de-legitimize the duly elected president of the opposing party from day one. But with Barack Obama, the fact that he is the first African-American president with a middle name Hussein has led to a new level of ugliness and suspicion. Attacks that demonize the president are poisoning the civic well from which we all drink. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon says Pew poll found 18 percent of Americans believe Obama is Muslim .
The misconception ranges across political spectrum. Why is this happening, he asks?

"(CNN) -- Reality TV star Snooki must prove in court next month that she was not annoying to people when she was on a beach in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, last month. Police charged the 22-year-old star of MTV's ""Jersey Shore"" with disorderly conduct and creating a public nuisance when they arrested her on July 30. But a prosecutor added a municipal ordinance violation of annoying people on the beach during a court hearing Wednesday. Snooki, whose real name is Nicole Polizzi, did not attend Wednesday's hearing. Her lawyer, Raymond Raya, appeared on her behalf to enter a ""not guilty"" plea on all charges, according to a Seaside Heights Municipal Court spokesman. Polizzi faces up to $3,200 in fines if found guilty of all charges. The disorderly conduct charge could also carry a 30-day jail sentence. A trial date was set for September 8.

"(CNN) -- Baskin-Robbins is putting five of its signature 31 flavors in the deep freeze. The company, which has thousands of outlets around the globe, is replacing some old flavors with new ones to celebrate National Ice Cream Day in the U.S. on Sunday, and Baskin-Robbin's 65th anniversary. Caramel Praline Cheesecake, Campfire S'mores, Apple Pie a La Mode and Superfudge Truffle are leaving the list. French Vanilla, a staple since 1945, is out, too. Srinivas Kumar, chief brand officer at the company, said ""over the decades we have retired some of our iconic flavors into our deep freeze -- like 'Miami Ice' from the 1980s and 'Beatlenut' in the 1960s -- but never before have five flavors gone into the deep freeze at one time."" That's cold. And it's ice cream lovers in the United States who'll likely miss the flavors most. The Illinois-based National Ice Cream Retailer's Association says the U.S is the world's top ice cream-consuming nation. The U.S. ice cream industry generates more than $21 billion in annual sales, and about  9 percent of all the milk produced by U.S. dairy farmers is used to produce ice cream, according to the International Dairy Foods Association. There's no word yet on what the new Baskin-Robbins flavors will be. And as for the old ones -- get them while you can. They'll only be available as supplies last.","Baskin-Robbins is retiring five of its 31 flavors of ice cream .

"(CNN) -- A black Agriculture Department employee who resigned after a video clip surfaced of her talking about a white farmer said Tuesday her remarks were taken out of context. Shirley Sherrod, the department's former state director of rural development for Georgia, told CNN the incident she discusses in the clip took place more than two decades ago -- and that she recounted it to an audience to make the point that people should move beyond race. ""I was speaking to that group, like I've done many groups, and I tell them about a time when I thought the issue was race and race only,"" Sherrod told CNN's ""American Morning"" from her home in Albany, Georgia. The incident took place in 1986, while she worked for a nonprofit and before she worked for the USDA, she said. ""I was telling the story of how working with him helped me to see the issue is not about race. It's about those who have versus those who do not have."" Sherrod resigned Monday after conservative media outlets aired the video, in which she says she did not give the white farmer ""the full force of what I could do"" to help him avoid foreclosure. Conservative website publisher Andrew Breitbart originally posted the video, which was quickly picked up by Fox News. The video claims Sherrod's remarks were delivered March 27 to an NAACP Freedom Fund banquet, but it is not clear that is the case, nor is it clear where the event was held or how many people were in attendance. The poor-quality video shows Sherrod telling her audience that the farmer she was working with ""took a long time ... trying to show me he was superior to me."" As a result, she said, she ""didn't give him the full force of what I could do. I did enough."" To prove she had done her job, she said, she took him to a white lawyer. ""I figured that if I take him to one of them, that his own kind would take care of him,"" she said. Sherrod mentioned that the lawyer would help the farmer with a bankruptcy filing but did not say in the clip whether his farm was saved. She told CNN that at the time, she was working with a nonprofit association aimed at assisting farmers in Georgia and the Southeast. In the end, she said, the lawyer did not help the farmer and she ""had to frantically find a lawyer who would file a Chapter 11 to stop the foreclosure."" She said she, the farmer and his wife wound up being friends. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday he had accepted Sherrod's resignation. ""There is zero tolerance for discrimination at USDA, and I strongly condemn any act of discrimination against any person,"" Vilsack said. ""We have been working hard through the past 18 months to reverse the checkered civil rights history at the department and take the issue of fairness and equality very seriously."" Sherrod told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution there were white people, including a mayor, at the banquet where she spoke. ""Why would I do something racist if they were there?"" The NAACP issued a statement late Monday backing Vilsack's decision. ""Racism is about the abuse of power.  Sherrod had it in her position at USDA.  According to her remarks, she mistreated a white farmer in need of assistance because of his race,"" said Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the civil rights group.  ""We are appalled by her actions, just as we are with abuses of power against farmers of color and female farmers."" ""Her actions were shameful,"" Jealous continued.  ""While she went on to explain in the story that she ultimately realized her mistake, as well as the common predicament of working people of all races, she gave no indication she had attempted to right the wrong she had done to this man."" Sherrod said it was ""unfortunate that the NAACP would make a statement without even checking to see what happened. This was 24 years ago, and I'm telling a story to try to unite people."" She said she tried to explain to USDA officials, ""but for some reason, the stuff Fox and the Tea Party does is scaring the administration. I told them to get the whole tape and look at the whole tape and see how I tell people we have to get beyond race and work together."" Asked why did she resigned instead of fought, Sherrod said, ""I didn't have any support from USDA. What would I do?"" James Peterson, assistant professor of English and Africana studies at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, called the clip ""a textbook case of institutional racism. Historically, it's been white against black, or white against whatever person of color is in question, but this is still institutional racism. We can't endorse it."" But he said, given later remarks made by Sherrod in the clip, ""it's clear that this is an anecdote ... It is clear she is using this as an anecdote to talk about how she's progressed from this moment, and we can't let the weight of historical issues with race shape our individual issues. ""I think she is using this an anecdote to work through her own issues but also to show the audience we can move beyond and transcend some of these circumstances,"" he said. The conservative media outlets tied the video to the NAACP's recent resolution calling on the Tea Party movement to repudiate racist elements within it that have displayed such items as images of President Barack Obama with a bone through his nose and the White House with a lawn full of watermelons. The controversy has led one Tea Party group to oust another because of a blog posting by the second group's leader. Tea Party Express leader Mark Williams posted on his blog a faux letter from NAACP president Benjamin Jealous to President Abraham Lincoln in which Williams ridicules the organization's use of ""colored"" in its historic name and uses multiple other stereotypes to bolster his point. The National Tea Party Foundation expelled Williams' organization from its coalition as a result.","Shirley Sherrod says her remarks were taken out of context .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The Great Depression is in full swing. Gangster Al Capone is sentenced to 11 years behind bars for tax evasion. Dick Tracy debuts in the comics. The George Washington Bridge opens. The old subway cars have concrete floors, overhead fans and open windows. The year is 1931. And New Yorkers are stepping onto the brand new R-1 model subway car, built by the American Car & Foundry factory in Berwick, Pennsylvania. Fast-forward 77 years. New Yorkers and tourists are once again boarding these 84,000-pound, 60-foot-long behemoths constructed of riveted steel, with some featuring wicker seats, dangling emergency brake cords, incandescent light bulbs, big exposed overhead fans, and open windows. ""I really thought I was getting on the wrong train until the conductor told me it's going to 23rd [Street], exactly where I'm going,'' said Joseph Salmond, who had never seen a subway car quite this old. ""It was like, what's that movie, 'Back to the Future'?""  Watch the ride back in time Â» . A legendary workhorse of the transit system until the model was put out to pasture in 1977, the R-1 is temporarily back in action as part of New York City Transit's holiday ""Nostalgia Train'' on Sundays in December. The R-1 and other rehabilitated subway cars from the 1930s to the 1970s are making the rounds from Manhattan's Lower East Side to the borough of Queens along the ""V"" line. Passengers love to ride on this special occasion, even though the ride is bumpier and noisier than they have grown accustomed to on today's gleaming stainless steel subways. Would New Yorkers want to ride these trains on a daily basis? ""Absolutely not,'' says Chuck Falkowitz, who remembers the R-1 from his childhood in the 1950s. He prefers today's cleaner seats, improved lighting, heating and air conditioning. ""But it is fun to ride them,'' Falkowitz says. ""Once a year's more than enough'' Bill Wall, a New York City Transit service supervisor working aboard the R-1 on a recent Sunday, said the train has a special effect on riders and subway employees alike. ""You come on a New York City subway, people are there, they read their papers, they're going about their business,"" he said. ""On this train, you see people smiling and talking to one another and saying, 'Oh, God, this is a great thing,' '' said Wall, proudly calling it ""transportainment."" Built like a battleship with steel body and concrete floors, the R-1 was simple and reliable. State of the art in its day, each car cost just under $40,000, according to Wall. Today's subway cars run the city about $1.5 million apiece. In the 1930s, the R-1's ceiling fans were a major improvement over relying solely on the motion of the train and open windows to move air around. But as time went on, people thought, ''Overhead fans that close to people's heads -- that may not be such a great idea,'' Wall said. In the 1940s, the system began switching to enclosed fans. Later, cooling and heating systems became the norm, which is why today's subway cars have lower ceilings. The R-1s were also the first trains in New York to have four sets of doors on the sides for rapid loading and unloading, a big boost to New York City subways' ability to accommodate the growing post-World War I population. With the R-1 in mind, Billy Strayhorn composed his 1939 classic tune, ""Take the A Train."" Given its historical legacy, what's an R-1 worth now? ""It's what you make it to be in terms of worth,"" Wall said. ""Some people look at it and say it's an old train worth whatever the scrap value is. Some people will look at it and say it's an heirloom."" ""You really can't even put a price on something like this,"" he says. To put things into perspective: In the 1970s the R-1s were being sold to scrap dealers for less than $1,000 each. If you think you'll get one for that price today, someone in Brooklyn has a bridge to sell you.","Some 1930s-era subway cars are back in service this month in New York .

"(CNN) -- A 20-year-old man waiting in line for a ride at Disney's California Adventure Park fell 25 to 30 feet Wednesday night, Anaheim police spokesman Sgt. Rick Martinez said Thursday. The man was in the building housing the queue for the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, when he put his leg over the railing and fell, Martinez said. ""The guest was standing in line with friends on a second-floor platform when he climbed over a barrier to the area below and lost his balance and fell approximately 25 feet,"" Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown said in a statement. Paramedics on site treated the man, Martinez said. A dispatcher for Metro Cities Fire Authority, which serves seven Orange County cities, said the man was brought to University of California Irvine Medical Center. ""The guest was transported by ambulance to the hospital. We understand his injuries were minor and he has been treated and released,"" Brown said. The incident happened around 10:30 p.m., the Metro Cities dispatcher said. It caused Disney to shut down the ride briefly while paramedics attended to the fallen park-goer, Martinez said, adding that the ride reopened soon thereafter. The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is a ride that brings visitors to the top of an elevator shaft, then drops them. The Disneyland website says, ""Join thrill-seekers at the mysterious Hollywood Tower Hotel for the ultimate adrenaline rush. For the longest 2 minutes of your life, rise and fall at terrifying speeds in the hotel's haunted elevator."" The California Adventure Park is adjacent to Disneyland in Anaheim.

"(CNN) -- All hail to the king and queen -- of catfish. Greg Bernal of Florissant, Missouri, and girlfriend Janet Momphard of St. Charles, Missouri, on Tuesday hauled what is believed to be a world record catfish into their boat while fishing on the Missouri River. The monster blue catfish weighed in at 130 pounds and was 45 inches in girth and 57 inches long, Dan Zarlenga, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Conservation, said Tuesday. ""It hasn't hit me yet. ... I'm still in shock,"" Bernal said Tuesday. Bernal, 47, said he was about to call it a day when he decided to give it one last shot. ""We threw the rod in, and about 30 minutes later, that rod took off,"" he said. ""I just put the pressure on him and tried to work him up towards the surface. His head broke the water and man, that was it, I knew I had a record breaker,"" Bernal said. Jim Blair, who keeps a state-certified scale at his feed store in New Melle, was notified Tuesday morning by the Missouri Department of Conservation that a couple may have caught a state record catfish and they needed to use his scale to get an official weight. ""My scale is inspected every year, it's certified by the state,"" said Blair. Before the catfish was put on the scale, Momphard said it had to at least weigh more than 120 pounds, because it weighed more than the generator Bernal kept in the back of his truck. ""Him and his girlfriend were jumping up and down because when it went over 100 pounds, they knew they had a state record, but when it went up to 130 pounds, they was really excited,"" said Blair. ""He'll be considered royalty in the fishing world."" Although several official witnesses were on site when the scale read 130 pounds, the International Game and Fish association still has to sign off on whether a world record has been broken. Tim Pruitt of Godfrey, Missouri, holds the official world record. He reeled in a 124-pound catfish in May 2005, in the same general area of the Missouri River, according to Zarlenga. And for those of you curious about the so-called honey hole where Bernal caught this monster fish? Sorry, he isn't talking. ""Back in 1995, I caught the Illinois state record catfish -- a blue that weighed 79.12 pounds,"" said Bernal. After that, he said, everybody knew who he was and started tracking his every move. ""I had to cut the running lights on my boat one time because I had boats following me."" Zarlenga says Bernal's keeping quiet about the exact location is understandable, but he expects to see more people fishing the general area along the Missouri River for their dream catch. Bernal is keeping the catfish, for the time being, in a friend's deep freezer. ""I'd like to see if one of the stores is interested in making a replication of it, like Bass Pro Shops or Cabela's,"" said Bernal. Meanwhile, he's catching up on sleep and hopes to celebrate soon with a couple of cold beers. ""I've been fishing for the monster my whole life ... by chance, he came by to my hook and I actually got him. I was just lucky, but I'm not going to argue with it, that's a world record,"" Bernal said.","The 130-pound blue catfish beats the world record by 6 pounds, an official says .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia Capitol police corporal was grazed by a bullet Wednesday afternoon during an exchange of gunfire with a man suspected of being part of a chop shop ring, authorities said. Three suspects, one of them wounded, were in custody, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead. The wounded officer was assisting a state trooper tracking a LoJack device in a suspected stolen motorcycle a few blocks from the Georgia Capitol in downtown Atlanta, Bankhead said. Several motorcycles were in a trailer attached to an SUV in an alley and the suspects were unloading them. The two officers approached one of the suspects shortly before 2 p.m. at an alleyway. One suspect brandished a weapon and a gun battle ensued, authorities said. The corporal was wounded by gunfire. CNN affiliates WSB-TV and WXIA reported the trooper wounded the suspected shooter shortly afterward. The police officer suffered a flesh wound in the head and was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital. WSB-TV reported he was released from the hospital. The injured suspect was taken to the same hospital and underwent surgery, Bankhead said. His condition was not available. Witnesses recalled a wild scene as swarms of officers looked for the two other suspects, who were found in a building by SWAT officers. Charges were pending Wednesday evening. The GBI and Atlanta Police Department will determine whether all of the motorcycles were stolen, Bankhead said. One of the suspects has an uspecified outstanding warrant in Fayette County, south of Atlanta, the GBI said.

"New York (CNN) -- For one New Yorker, the journey to the Pearly Gates involved a detour to the city's car pound. On Monday, the New York City Police Department towed an illegally parked van carrying a body. The van, parked outside Redden's Funeral Home on West 14th Street, was to transport the body to Newark for a flight. Calls and e-mails Friday about the towing to funeral director Paul DeNigris yielded no response. But according to the New York Daily News, DeNigris said he went inside the funeral home to get paperwork and answer a phone call. When he returned, the van was gone -- along with the body that was in a white cardboard box, the newspaper said. ""I was just a wreck,"" he told the newspaper. ""I was frantic. When something like that happens, you go into panic mode."" DeNigris recovered the van about 90 minutes later, stuck in vehicular purgatory -- the city's pound. The police waived the towing fee, $185, to expedite the vehicle's release, said Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of public information for the police. Police described the van as an unmarked 2002 Dodge with tinted windows. The first ticket was issued at 9:22 a.m. Three hours later, it was towed, police officials said. Browne said DeNigris should ask himself why he left a body unattended in an unmarked van, parked illegally for nearly three hours. ""What if the van had had been stolen instead of towed?"" he asked in an e-mail to CNN. ""Shouldn't he or someone from the funeral home staff have stayed with the body?"" Randy McCullough, deputy director of the New York State Funeral Directors Association, said the state has no rule in place that requires signage to indicate a funeral van. Hearses may be synonymous with funerals, but minivans and sport utility vehicles often transport bodies, too, said Jessica A.

She called the situation in New York ""exceedingly rare.""","Van parked illegally outside funeral home for three hours, police say .

"PUERTO MONTT, Chile (CNN) -- Nearly a week after a volcano erupted in Chaiten, Chile, disgorging its contents across a wide area of the Andes Mountains, authorities finished evacuating the area most affected. Though the eruption has been continuous, it increased at midnight Wednesday, powered by a massive explosion, then returned to its steady discharge of ash, officials said. Overnight, authorities armed with a court order evacuated the last of the holdouts -- many of whom had sought to remain to care for their cattle -- among the approximately 5,000 residents inside the 30-kilometer (18-mile) exclusion zone, said Carmen Fernandez, director of Chile's Office of Emergency. By Thursday morning, about 100 people -- primarily police, military and journalists -- remained in the immediate vicinity of the volcano, she said. In Bariloche, 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the volcano, Chilean Minister of Defense Jose Goni met Thursday with Argentine Vice President Julio Cobos to coordinate the transfer of the cows in the affected zone to Argentine territory, 60 kilometers (37 miles) away. Many of Bariloche's residents clutched handkerchiefs to their faces or wore cloth masks -- handed out by the government -- as they went about their business. Even with the masks, breathing could be difficult. Thick layers of ash covered everything like freshly fallen snow. Bariloche's airport and other regional airports were shut Thursday after satellite photos revealed that the air over the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Rio Negro, Neuquen and Chubut was filled with ash. The most dense clouds of the material were seen over Chubut and Rio Negro, with lesser amounts in the other provinces. In all, clouds of ash covered nearly a third of Argentina, the country's meteorological service said. As of noon Thursday, ash could be seen in the sky above Buenos Aires and its suburbs, it said. ""The sky appears gray, products of the presence of ashes that are moving from west to east at an altitude of about 3,500 meters,"" the service said.  Watch volcano eruption Â» . ""Fortunately, the composition of the ash, air and smoke that is coming out of the volcano isn't highly toxic,"" said Mirta Roses, director of the Pan American Health Organization. But, she said, children, older people and people with allergies or asthma are at highest risk and should make extra efforts to avoid it. Many of the evacuees were taken to Puerto Montt, a port city in southern Chile about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Chaiten. The volcano, which is about 1210 kilometers (752 miles) south of the Chilean capital, Santiago, began erupting early Friday, raining gray ash onto Chaiten. The small city is on the Corcovado Gulf, in southern Chile. The volcano last erupted around 7,420 B.C., according to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Project. Chile contains a large number of active volcanoes, including Llaima, which erupted in January, sending lava and smoke down a snow-covered mountain.

"(CNN) -- Even as Facebook titles like ""FrontierVille"" and ""Restaurant City"" continue to attract millions of players, interest in social games may be waning. A rise of tongue-in-cheek parody games that poke fun at these popular outings points to rising discontent amongst both gaming fans and industry insiders. ""There's a general feeling of discomfort and bafflement with all of the FarmWhatever and MobsterBoss notifications you see on Facebook and other social networks,"" said Persuasive Games founder Ian Bogost. ""It's become almost absurdist."" Witness Bogost's new social gaming spoof, ""Cow Clicker,"" a Facebook game in which you click on cows to earn the right to click on more cows. It's a form of biting interactive satire. ""Any cultural force that we don't grasp but that seems to overtake us becomes ripe for parody,"" Bogost added. ""I created 'Cow Clicker' in part to give myself and others a second look at 'FarmVille' and its ilk and force social-network games players to ask themselves what these [titles] are and why they're so compelling."" From social-gaming protest groups to fake ""FarmVille"" commercials, there are plenty of signs that other social networkers share similar sentiments. This year has also brought ""Progress Wars,"" a game in which players repeatedly click to complete random missions such as ""ambush silk traders"" or ""slay dealers."" Creator Jakob Skjerning's blog said he analyzed popular Facebook games and distilled their gameplay into core game mechanics ""to point out the pointlessness of many casual games."" Some gaming experts claim that social-network games put business concerns before artistic ones and are specifically designed to prompt base Pavlovian responses and keep players clicking away. According to New York University games researcher and theorist Jesper Juul, social games are ""brain hacks that exploit human psychology in order to make money."" ""There are forces that compel us humans to do incredibly counterintuitive things,"" concurred Bogost. "" 'Cow Clicker' is a game in which you click a cow, and yet that simple act can still swallow us whole. We like to think of ourselves as rational beings with control over our faculties, but far more often, we are at the whim of things rather than master over them."" Some professional game makers even accuse social network titles of promoting addictiveness and using shame as a motivator. For example, ""FrontierVille"" players who fail to accept requests from friends or upkeep their virtual homesteads may be subject to public mockery. Social networks like Facebook offer gamers the ability to interact easily with millions of other users and rally support for positive causes, Bogost says. But he believes that their potential is being underutilized by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs. ""It's not the idea of social games that are the problem. [It's that] nobody's talking about what would make them good art but only what would make them immensely profitable,"" he said. Naturally, social game makers beg to differ. Brian Reynolds, chief designer for ""FarmVille"" creator Zynga, whose games also include such Facebook hits as ""Mafia Wars,"" believes that social games ""tend to be vastly underrated by many of gaming's opinion leaders."" ""This is partially I think because they're so simple,"" he suggested, ""and partially because people just aren't used to the business model or games being able to speak to such a large mass market audience."" Reynolds, the former head of Big Huge Games and a strategy game designer whose credited work includes contributions to the ""Civilization"" franchise, thinks social network titles are a major positive for the field. ""Working in social games feels more like the games industry did when I started 20 years ago,"" he says. ""Small, scrappy teams working on games that emphasize fun and playability, and not so much huge technology, 3-D engines and full-motion video. For designers, it's a really fertile space to be creative."" Despite a steep drop off in popularity since Facebook shut off social games' ability to spam user profiles with messages and updates this year, Reynolds argues that the market for social gaming hasn't peaked. He cautions that some user attrition is inevitable and that an ongoing evolution in social gaming is needed to stave off player boredom, and he believes that the fundamental multiplayer context of these games will ensure their survival. ""That's the real nuclear bomb for me,"" he said. ""Unlike previous games, you're playing light games with real friends that you have actual 'real-world' social connections with, not meeting strangers online."" Bogost believes traditional game developers are ""stuck in a strange no-man's-land"" between the entertainment industry and the high-tech industry. ""At the same time, traditional developers are understandably startled and even jealous of the massive and sudden success of social games,"" he said. ""So there's a good deal of self-loathing at work.""","Interest in social games, such as Facebook's ""FarmVille,"" may be waning .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- This week, France began deporting members of the Roma population as part of what it says is a crackdown on illegal immigration. It has put the focus back on the Roma, who remain widely misunderstood despite being one of Europe's largest minorities. France begins controversial Roma expulsion . Who are the Roma? Roma, also called Gypsies or Romany, are a group of people marked by poverty who live mainly in southern and eastern Europe, though they live throughout the continent. They tend to live in camps, caravans, or informal settlements and have been persecuted throughout history. Some are Christian and some are Muslim, having converted while migrating through Persia and the Balkans, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Most Roma speak dialects of a language called Romani, which is based on Sanskrit, the classical language of India, the museum says. The language is largely unwritten, however, because of the high rates of illiteracy in most Roma communities, according to information from Minnesota State University. Where did the Roma come from? Roma originated in the Punjab region of northern India as a nomadic people and entered Europe between the 8th and 10th centuries, according to the Holocaust museum. They were called Gypsies because Europeans mistakenly believed they came from Egypt. Many Roma traditionally worked as craftsmen and were blacksmiths, cobblers, tinsmiths, horse dealers, and toolmakers, according to the museum. Others were performers like musicians, circus animal trainers, and dancers. By the 1920s, some were also working as shopkeepers or civil servants. The number of nomadic Roma was on the decline in many places by the early 1900s, though many ""sedentary"" Roma often moved seasonally, depending on their occupations, the museum says. Where did the Roma go in Europe? Roma were living in Spain, France, England, and large parts of what is today Russia and Eastern Europe by the late 1400s. They suffered persecution in those countries ranging from laws against their language and dress to expulsion, according to Minnesota State. In the beginning of the 15th century, many Roma were forced into slavery by Hungarian and Romanian nobles who needed laborers for their large estates, according to the university. Roma suffered persecution during World War II. The Nazis judged Roma to be ""racially inferior,"" according to the Holocaust museum. ""Their fate in some ways paralleled that of the Jews,"" the museum said. The Nazis subjected Roma to internment, forced labor, and murder. ""While exact figures or percentages cannot be ascertained, historians estimate that the Germans and their allies killed around 25 percent of all European Roma,"" the museum says. ""Of slightly less than 1 million Roma believed to have been living in Europe before the war, the Germans and their Axis partners killed up to 220,000."" What is the situation for Roma in Europe today? Many Roma live on the edges of communities or are transient. They suffer massive discrimination throughout Europe, according to Amnesty International, and are often the victims of forced evictions, racist attacks and ill-treatment by police, and are often denied their rights to housing, employment, health care and education. In Slovakia, thousands of Roma children are placed in special schools and classes designed for pupils with ""mild mental disabilities"" or in ethnically segregated mainstream schools and classes that provide a substandard education, Amnesty says. Human Rights Watch expressed concern last year about a wave of attacks on Roma in Kosovo, and the United Nations pointed to mounting racial violence in Russia in 2008 that targeted Roma and other ethnic and religious minorities. In June 2009, there was a series of attacks on Roma families in Northern Ireland, where the Roma had gone for work. In Bosnia, Roma are barred from running for president or the upper chamber of Parliament. The Budapest, Hungary-based European Roma Rights Center sent a letter of concern to Danish authorities last month about the recent mass arrest and deportation of 23 Roma in Copenhagen. They said Danish officials, including the mayor of Copenhagen and the country's justice minister, had made comments blaming the Roma for crimes. A U.N. report last year cited the cost of deprivation among the Roma. In Bulgaria, it said, their life expectancy is five to six years below the rest of the population and their infant mortality rate is six times the national average. In Hungary, infant mortality among the Roma is nearly four times the country's average, and in Romania it is two and a half times greater, according to the report.","Roma are also called Gypsies or Romany .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- When I was a little boy, my dad and I would sit on the floor next to his old reel-to-reel tape deck, taking turns talking into it and playing our voices back -- the same reel-to-reel he unwittingly used to gain his 15 minutes of fame. It was October 3, 1951, when Larry Goldberg, a 26-year-old travel agent living with his parents in Brooklyn, set up the deck next to a radio before setting off to work in Manhattan. He asked his mom to record the 9th inning of the third game of the Brooklyn Dodgers-New York Giants playoffs. What he and my grandmother captured turned out to be the only known recording at the time of Russ Hodges' famous call of Bobby Thomson's game-winning home run, ""The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!"" SI.com: Thomson tops list of 10 most memorable home runs . My dad's reward was a tape cartridge, $100 and access to box seats at the Polo Grounds the next season -- a pittance for which my mom often needled him. Those memories came flooding back this week when I heard the news that Thomson had died at his Savannah, Georgia, home at age 86. Thomson's ""Shot Heard 'Round The World"" was heard often at our home, each time I asked my dad to tell me once more how he saved the call. He kept the original tape safely boxed up, instead playing one of the Chesterfield records of the call that Hodges' sponsor pressed as gifts to its dealers. For a long time, no one but a handful of friends and family knew the real story of my dad's role in helping immortalize a bit of baseball history. Then, on the 50th anniversary of the game, the New York Times ran an interview with Dad. His local paper, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, did a similar story. Accounts of his recording later appeared in books such as ""The Golden Voices of Baseball"" and Joshua Prager's ""The Echoing Green."" Don DeLillo even captured the event in his 1997 novel, ""Underworld,"" referring to Dad only as ""a man on 12th Street in Brooklyn."" Here's how Dad and The New York Times told the story: . "" 'I knew I wouldn't be able to listen to the broadcast, and I knew something was going to happen,' said Goldberg. ... 'It was the third game of the playoffs. That kind of game had to be climactic, even if it was a blowout.' ""Was Goldberg's mother, Sylvia, a baseball fan? No. Was she paying strict attention to the game? No, he said, 'she was paying attention to her only son.' ... From the SI vault: The Day Bobby Hit The Home Run . ""The night after the game, Goldberg wrote Hodges to ask if anyone at WMCA had recorded the game; if not, he would lend him his. Hodges replied quickly, and used the tape to make records as Christmas gifts. ... ""In later years, when Hodges related the tale of the tape, he would refer to Goldberg as a Dodger fan who made the tape so he could hear the voice of the Giants weep when Brooklyn won. A good yarn, but untrue. '' 'I was a Giant fan from 1933 on, when I was 8,' Goldberg said."" I'd been thinking about Bobby Thomson, Russ Hodges and Dad just the other day when my son and I went to our first Braves game of the season -- our first game since Dad died a year ago in April. It was a little before 7 p.m. at Atlanta's Turner Field, and the Braves were about to face the Giants -- now long since relocated to San Francisco. My son and I were sitting down to eat on the stadium's terrace when the matrix board began playing a video introducing the visitors. Images of past pennants were flashing on the screen when it suddenly hit me -- these are the same Giants that once called New York's Polo Grounds home. And before I knew it, they were playing the call I've come to know so well -- Bobby Thomson hitting his ""long fly ... into the lower deck of the left-field stands."" Once more, ""The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! ... The Giants win the pennant! And they're going crazy. They're going crazy!'' I wanted to phone Dad and tell him about it, at the same time realizing I couldn't -- that I'd even told the story about the call at his funeral. And then I knew he was with us there in the stadium, smiling down on a perfect summer evening of baseball.","Bobby Thomson, who hit one of baseball's most memorable home runs, died this week at 86 .

"(CNN) -- Hollywood producers couldn't have written Colton Harris-Moore's story better if they had dreamed it up themselves. No one was surprised to hear that 20th Century Fox jumped at the chance to purchase the rights for a film based on the 19-year-old Washington native's exploits. Harris-Moore, suspected of stealing automobiles, boats and airplanes, as well as committing a number of other thefts, earned his nickname -- the Barefoot Bandit -- by committing some of his crimes without shoes. In 2009, police found footprints in an Iowa airport hangar. Harris-Moore was apprehended on July 11 after a high-speed boat chase in the Bahamas. He has since been moved to Miami, Florida, where he appeared before a federal judge at an identity hearing. He is being transferred to a federal prison in Seattle, Washington. His story, which mirrors 2002's ""Catch Me If You Can"" -- based on the true story of con-artist Frank Abagnale Jr. -- has people talking, although details of the ""Barefoot"" film are still under lock and key. ""I wrote when he first started running that he would get a movie deal,"" CNN commenter SICKBOY70 wrote. ""They offered him a reward to come in that was nowhere near what the movie people would offer."" Another CNN.com commenter, BostonChuck, wrote: ""It's a good thing he was caught, he was breaking the law. However... this all seems like something out of Hollywood. It's going to make a heck of a movie!"" The prospect of a film version also has Hollywood casting directors talking about which young actor might play the role of the barefoot bandit. ""Crash"" and ""Iron Man"" casting director Randi Hiller didn't hesitate when asked which young Hollywood star would make a good barefoot bandit. ""['Percy Jackson' star] Logan Lerman. ... He's young, he's charming and he's a really good actor,"" Hiller said. Lerman's charm could come in handy, too. Hiller said It's important to cast a likable young man because, while the Barefoot Bandit may be in the wrong, he's also the protagonist. ""You kind of root for him, even though he's done something really, really wrong,"" she added. Regardless of who nabs the role, Hiller said the film is sure to do well. ""Everybody wants more information."" The movie will most likely follow the tone of ""Catch Me If You Can,"" Hiller said. ""It's not laugh out loud funny, but there's definitely amusing bits."" Casting director Tammara Billik, who also made the connection between the Barefoot Bandit and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Catch Me If You Can,"" said the movie will be a success, whether it's on the big screen or the flat screen. When casting a role like this one, it's important to choose an actor who resembles the other person, she said. However, Billik added, it's important to remember that ""his story is more familiar than his face."" ""You don't want somebody who can't act, but looks exactly like the guy,"" she added, noting that it might be difficult to find an actor with Harris-Moore's 6-foot-5 frame -- which is why she suggests taller actors like ""Friday Night Lights' "" Zach Gilford and ""The Last Song's"" Liam Hemsworth.","Source: It's important to choose an actor who resembles the bandit .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Walter Hawkins, a Grammy Award-winning gospel singer, composer and pastor, has died of pancreatic cancer, his church said Monday on its website. He was 61. Born in Oakland, California., Hawkins' musical career began at a young age as a member of the Northern California State Youth Choir. He later helped found The Edwin Hawkins Singers, a collaboration that resulted in the Grammy-winning song ""Oh Happy Day,"" one of the first gospel songs to become popular on mainstream music charts. It was also named one of the Recording Industry Association of America's Songs of the Century. Hawkins recorded his first solo album, ""Do Your Best,"" in 1972. He later founded the Love Center Church in Oakland, where he created the Love Center Choir. With the choir he recorded a series of albums, titled ""Love Alive,"" that topped the Billboard Gospel Album charts and sold more than 1 million copies from the 1970s to the 1990s, according to the church's website.

"United Nations (CNN) -- U.N. officials are pleading for immediate economic assistance for four African countries where people are facing malnutrition in the wake of a drought last year. The coming weeks ahead will be the toughest for these countries in the Sahel -- the stretch of African countries including Niger, Chad, Mali and Mauritania -- as they make their way into the rainy season and scrape by with the little food they have since last year's harvest, officials said. Humanitarian agencies and relief organizations pushed for continued economic support from the international community on behalf of the drought-ridden African countries at the United Nations on Tuesday. ""The levels of food insecurity have begun to spiral out of control and affect a number of countries across the region,"" U.N. Under-Secretary-General John Holmes said. ""Niger is the center of this crisis, it is a country by far the worst affected, some 7 million people are suffering from severe or moderate food insecurity and that's almost fifty percent of the country's population,"" Holmes said. Over 10 million people in the Sahel are at risk for food shortages, according to the U.N., and their situation is unlikely to improve until the coming harvest in October. ""We're in the long stretch between last year's harvest and the one coming up,"" said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Programme, via telephone from Niger. ""We have now six weeks until it is agreed we will be out of the severe danger zone and the ramp-up has to happen not in a few weeks but now, before this very difficult time,"" Sheeran said. In Chad, thousands of children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The number of severely malnourished children doubled from 2,900 in 2009 to 6,508 this year. ""At the end of the day, what kills children suffering from malnutrition is disease of some kind affecting them in their weakened states. And we're particularly concerned that as the rainy season is starting now, diseases like malaria, diarrhea and respiratory diseases will spread as they always do at this time of year and the death rates for the affected children will go up rapidly,"" Holmes said. The World Food Programme is expected to increase the number of health centers from 52 to around 140 in the coming weeks. The centers ""will be placed strategically in the most vulnerable areas where we're seeing the highest rates of acute malnutrition,"" said Sheeran. As the Sahel enters the rainy season, many of the roads will become impassable. Sheeran said the aim of the assistance is to ""go into the most severely affected areas to ensure that we have adequate distribution and can reach those families that are cut off on the roads that are becoming much more difficult."" Leaders from the relief organizations urged the international community to step up its economic support for the people in the Sahel. Eveline Rooijmans, a policy adviser with the aid organization Oxfam, said the assistance is needed now. ""What we need now is urgent action from international leaders and donors to make sure that people have access to food now and in the future,"" Rooijmans said. ""While for the future we should indeed invest in long-term measure to avoid this type of crisis from happening again, at this very moment it is about urgent short-term action.""","People in four African countries are facing malnutrition after a drought last year .

"(OPRAH.com) -- In Jackson, Mississippi, Ceara Sturgis has grown up with her classmates for the past 12 years. Day in day out, she was a well-liked, self-described ""tomboy,"" an academically gifted student. Yet, when her senior picture and any mention of her went missing from the yearbook, it became clear she'd been removed because of her status as an out lesbian. Big deal? To many, the answer is yes. How would you feel if someone you love told you he or she was gay? How would your view evolve in that moment or over time? Could it change? Why would it change? ""Don't tramp on my rights,"" my brother Robert recently told me at my nephew Ian's wedding in Oregon. Robert was commenting on gay people who want marriage rights. Somehow, it had become all about him, rather than about them. I asked how letting gays marry would infringe on his rights? ""I love the sinner,"" he said. ""The thief, the alcoholic, the adulterer, the homosexual need God's restoration, not our approval."" He is a believer that the ""gay can be prayed away,"" and that it is, bottom line, a defect caused by the devil. Oprah.com: Get the answers to all your questions about prayer . This yearbook deletion goes to the heart of the larger issue: how, as a nation, we're split on this notion of sexual identity and tolerance. We are still split as a nation on what we believe, though it's more evenly divided today than ever. It's one part belief, another part feeling. Oprah.com: Is there a conflict between homosexuality and spirituality? Gallup released its annual findings on sexuality that tell how we have changed. As of a couple weeks ago, more than 50 percent of Americans now accept gay relationships. What's more, 78 percent of Americans now believe gay Americans should be allowed to serve in the military, while 48 percent believe gay Americans should have the right to marry. These are the facts. How are the feelings? How does this conversation make you feel? My own parents believed they could cast demons of homosexuality out of people. The joke in my family today is one of the demons slithered out the family room window and came in through my bedroom window while I was sleeping. Truth was, I knew I was gay when I was 4 years old. My mom knew I was gay around the same time, as I was smooching on other boys, yet it caused a commotion and distress when I came out in my late teens just the same, and my parents promptly sent me to a ""pray away the gay"" therapist. Oprah.com: What it's like to be gay around the world . My brother, who I mentioned earlier, is this kind of therapist. Every few weeks, I get an email or a call from a family (usually it's a mom who reaches out) asking for my help in doing a ""gay intervention"" on their kid. Even as the sexual myths have gone the way of flat Earth theories, the way we feel, and the ways we believe sexuality to be, are more often than not based on the biases and beliefs we grew up with. I was raised being taught white folks (us) shouldn't date or marry a person of another race or even religion. ""It's not God's ideal for us,"" my mother would warn. Oprah.com: Let's get real about sexuality . It's important to note that in 1968, only 28 percent of Americans supported the legalization of interracial marriage even as Loving vs. Virginia, legalized the very union across the nation that same year. It would take until 1991 until Americans' support for it crossed the 50 percent threshold. But gay? Is it really all that good? Look, it took me awhile to get used to it being okay, having grown up in a place where what I was, was preached on and spoken of as an abomination. I expected my parents to get hip to the trip really quick, and it wasn't that way. It took years for them to come to some new understanding on gay -- and frankly, it's still up in the air what my mom would say if you asked her if gays should marry. It depends on the day. Oprah.com: Country singer Chely Wright on coming out . On the other hand, as we have these hard conversations about who we are and who we believe others to be, it's critical that myths not be counted as fact. A human being comes to grips with his or her sexual orientation, finally comes out to the family and then is furious when the family doesn't get ""hip to the trip"" right away? It happens. ""I'm embarrassed to admit that it took me 27 years to get comfortable with the gay thing, and then I expected my family to find acceptance in a minute,"" a friend told me recently. Homosexual creatures are found throughout God's wild and wonderful animal kingdom. It's not unnatural, I think, just not the norm. In Mississippi, the stir was caused by a masculine version of a yearbook photo that said with one look that she was not likely the norm. When I came out, my mom was devastated. For my whole family, this issue brought them right up against how they felt about what they had been taught. They came face-to-face with a bias created in a vacuum. But what did they know? Oprah says, ""I know what I know."" I would ask you, is what you know is informed by flat Earth theology or feelings based on others' prejudices? If the answer is yes, maybe it's time to pull out your own yearbook and see who made you feel uncomfortable and why? Then, pray on it and come up with your own answer that's loving and kind, no matter where it falls. Oprah.com: What prayer really means . Brad Lamm is a board-registered interventionist.

"Washington (CNN) -- Global financial reform topped the agenda Tuesday as President Obama huddled with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, whose country is at the center of Europe's debt crisis. The White House meeting marks the conclusion of a four-country financial relief tour for the beleaguered Greek leader. Beginning Friday, he visited Germany, France and Luxembourg seeking support for his government's new austerity measures to counteract skyrocketing budget deficits. Greece had one of the worst budget deficits in the developed world last year, at 12.7 percent of gross domestic product, more than three times higher than previously declared due to accounting irregularities -- or what some call outright fraud. It also has a public-sector debt equivalent to 113 percent of its entire economy. Athens recently unveiled a package of budget reductions to try to bring its deficit down to the 3 percent level allowed under the rules for the eurozone -- the European Union countries that have adopted the euro currency. Finance ministers from those 16 countries met in Brussels last month to try to find a way to end the crisis that some analysts say could spread to other heavily indebted European nations, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy. Greece's ""deficit is more a credibility deficit than a financial deficit, and we need to bring back the sense of credibility,"" Papandreou said recently. His unpopular budget cutbacks have met with stiff political resistance and strikes at home. Overseas, the Greek prime minister is trying to win support for greater regulation over certain forms of financial speculation that analysts say have made his country's debt crisis worse. Among other things, Papandreou is asking U.S. and other leaders to restrict the use of credit default swaps, which are insurance contracts -- the same kind of contracts that pushed insurance giant American International Group (AIG) to the brink of collapse. Two weeks ago, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Federal Reserve is looking into actions taken by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms that may have contributed to Greece's debt problems. Bernanke's comment came in response to a question posed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, who asked about U.S. banks and hedge funds making financial bets that the Greek government will default on its loans. Goldman Sachs and other banks have been in the news over reports they secretly helped raise $1 billion in credit for Greece in a way that was off the balance sheet, and that they helped hide the country's debt woes from European Union regulators. The New York Times reported recently that some of these same banks also were making side bets that Greece would default on loans it owes American banks and hedge funds. By betting in favor of default, the U.S. banks and hedge funds would win whether Greece pays off its loans or not. Dodd asked whether Bernanke thought there should be limits on the use of these types of bets to prevent firms from creating intentional runs against governments. ""The rising price of these contracts contribute to an atmosphere of crisis, making it even more difficult for the Greek government, in my opinion, to borrow,"" Dodd said. Bernanke noted the similarity of the situation of banks making bets to hedge against Greek debt to banks that made bets to hedge against real estate debt, which imploded AIG. ""The poster child for that would be the capital arrangements that banks took out for AIG,"" he said. ""Derivatives have a legitimate purpose, but if they're used to distort accounting results or regulatory ratios, that needs to be addressed."" Congress is considering legislation to make such financial bets more transparent. Papandreou has asked American and European authorities to crack down on financial speculators who benefited from taxpayer bailouts only to turn around and profit by exacerbating his country's debt crisis. ""Enough is enough,"" he told an audience at the Brookings Institution on Monday. CNN's Jennifer Liberto, Christine Theodorou and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","President Obama met Tuesday with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou .

"New York (CNN) -- If saving money in 2010 is on top of your list, we have some simple ways you can cut costs. 1. Your cell phone . Cell phones are a big expense for a lot of folks. The cost of an average plan is $65 per month or $780 a year, according to Myvalidas.com. Chances are you're overpaying. Consumer Reports says about two thirds of people didn't use half the minutes they had available. So make sure you take a look at the minutes and texts you've used in the past six months and compare that to your plan's limits. If you're not even close to maxing out, it makes sense to shop around for other plans. Switching could save you up to $300 a year. Billshrink and Myvalidas.com are two Web sites that analyze your current bill for errors, help you recover money from overcharges and compare your current plan with other plans that may help save you money, depending on your usage. And here's something you may not think about. Let's say you have an unexpected life event ... maybe a birth, a death or an illness. Your cell phone usage is likely to spike. But rather than pay an exorbitant overcharge for a single month of use, ask your carrier about letting you switch temporarily to a higher minute plan. Then switch back when your usage abates. 2. Car insurance . The average premium on car insurance is about $1,800 per year, according to Insurance.com. But there are ways you can whittle down that bill. First, auto insurance companies want to know how safe you are. It's not only how safe you are on the roads. They also want to know how stable you are as a person. The longer you've held the same job, the higher your education level, the fact that you own a home -- that all counts toward what kind of risk you represent. The safer you are, the less money you'll pay in premiums. So, if you've bought a home, gotten your master's degree, if you've found a job you've been with for over a year, make sure you let your insurance company know -- and ask to be repriced. You could save up to $750 a year, according to Insurance.com. Here are some other discounts you don't want to leave on the table: A low mileage discount could save you $100 a year. This is a great option if you drive less than 10,000 miles a year. If you have a good student, cut down on those insurance costs with a good student discount. That could save you $300 a year. Raising your deductible can yield you $200 to $400 a year. And shopping around before your current insurance policy expires can save you $250 a year, according to Insurance.com. 3. Entertainment . If you have old CDs or DVDs or books you don't want anymore, trade them for new stuff online. Check out swapadvd.com and paperbackswap.com. If you're looking for cheaper seats to a concert or sports event, check out zebratickets.com. This site aggregates prices from different ticket retailers. Did you know that your AAA membership can get you more than roadside assistance? You can get discounts at retailers like Target.com, Pearle Vision or Sears.com. CNN's Jen Haley contributed to this report.","Consumer Reports says many people don't use half their phone minutes .
Car insurance can go down if you've made life changes that make you safer .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- They are young, earn little and spend little, and take a keen interest in fashion and personal appearance -- meet the ""herbivore men"" of Japan. Former CNN intern Junichiro Hori is a self-described 'herbivore.' Author and pop culture columnist Maki Fukasawa coined the term in 2006 in a series of articles on marketing to a younger generation of Japanese men. She used it to describe some men who she said were changing the country's ideas about just what is -- and isn't -- masculine. ""In Japan, sex is translated as 'relationship in flesh,'"" she said, ""so I named those boys 'herbivorous boys' since they are not interested in flesh."" Typically, ""herbivore men"" are in their 20s and 30s, and believe that friendship without sex can exist between men and women, Fukasawa said. The term has become a buzzword in Japan. Many people in Tokyo's Harajuku neighborhood were familiar with ""herbivore men"" -- and had opinions about them. Shigeyuki Nagayama said such men were not eager to find girlfriends and tend to be clumsy in love, and he admitted he seemed to fit the mold himself. ""My father always asks me if I got a girlfriend. He tells me I'm no good because I can't get a girlfriend."" Midori Saida, a 24-year-old woman sporting oversized aviators and her dyed brown hair in long ringlets, said ""herbivore men"" were ""flaky and weak."" ""We like manly men,"" she said. ""We are not interested in those boys -- at all."" Takahito Kaji, 21, said he has been told he is ""totally herbivorous."" ""Herbivorous boys are fragile, do not have a stocky body -- skinny."" Fukasawa said Japanese men from the baby boomer generation were typically aggressive and proactive when it came to romance and sex. But as a result of growing up during Japan's troubled economy in the 1990s, their children's generation was not as assertive and goal-oriented. Their outlook came, in part, from seeing their fathers' model of masculinity falter even as Japanese women gained more lifestyle options. Former CNN intern Junichiro Hori, a self-described herbivore, said the idea goes beyond looks and attitudes toward sex. ""Some guys still try to be manly and try to be like strong and stuff, but you know personally I'm not afraid to show my vulnerability because being vulnerable or being sensitive is not a weakness."" Older generations of Japanese men are not happy about the changes. At a bar frequented by businessmen after work, one man said: ""You need to be carnivorous when you make decisions in your life. You should be proactive, not passive."" Fukasawa said the group does not care so much about making money -- a quality tied to the fact that there are fewer jobs available during the current global economic recession. Japan's economy recently saw its largest-ever recorded contraction and has shrunk for four straight quarters. Blue chip companies Sony, Panasonic, Toyota and Nissan all reported losses in May, and most are forecasting the same for the current fiscal year. Though still low by international standards, Japan's reported 5 percent unemployment is the highest since 2003. Hori agreed economics has played a role. When he finished university, ""a lot of my friends were trying to work for a big company that pays well and I wasn't interested in that. I am kind of struggling financially and my father is not very happy about it,"" he said. Fukasawa estimated some 20 percent of men are what she would call ""herbivorous"" and said their attitudes were influencing others. Indeed, she said, it was a return to the norm for Japanese men, rather than a departure. ""It was after World War II and the post-war economic growth that Japanese men gained the reputation as a sex animal through the competition with the West. Looking back beyond that time, older literature talks a lot about men with the kind of character we see in the herbivorous boys."" Will these men simply grow out of this? Fukasawa said it was anyone's guess. Some of them may, but Japan's image of masculinity is nonetheless changing. ""The men in dark suits are changing, too,"" she said. ""Today's young people in dark suits are different from the baby boomers in dark suits. They are evolving, too.""","Author and pop culture columnist Maki Fukasawa coins the term 'herbivore men'

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old girl died Tuesday after falling into floodwaters near Flagstaff, Arizona, authorities said. Shaelyn Wilson had gone to see runoff from a flash flood around 2 p.m., according to the Coconino Sheriff's Department. A younger sister ran back to tell the father that Shaelyn had fallen into a wash. The family searched the area near where the girl fell and several agencies also took part in the search, according to Kelli Most, administrative specialist with the sheriff's department. The girl was found about a third of a mile from where she went into the water, and her father performed CPR until paramedics arrived. She was pronounced dead at Flagstaff Medical Center. A massive wildfire last month made the area susceptible to flooding, said Most. ""There's just no greenery there"" to prevent runoff, she said. The blaze charred 15,000 acres. Several small streams pushed over their banks, and flash floods were threatening homes, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.","Girl, 12, dies in flooding near Flagstaff, Arizona .

"(CNN) -- Eight more employees from the Utah Department of Workforce Services are being questioned in connection with a leaked list containing personal information of 1,300 alleged illegal immigrants, Dave Lewis, a department spokesman, said Monday afternoon. He said that makes a total of 10 employees questioned, including the two placed on administrative leave last week. Investigators are interviewing employees who have had access to certain cases ""for legitimate business reasons,"" he said. ""We want to give them the opportunity to explain work they're doing."" Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday that he expects to launch a formal investigation into the data leak very soon. He said he was awaiting the names of at least two suspects from the state's executive branch. Lewis said the investigators' goal is to get all the interviews done Monday and he believed the suspects' names would be delivered to the attorney general later in the day. By early Monday afternoon, the Department of Workforce Services' general counsel had been in touch with the attorney general's office to bring lawyers there up to speed, Lewis said. Earlier Shurtleff said, ""It's important we get to the bottom of it immediately. We have condemned ... the dissemination, the use, the purpose of the list in the strongest possible terms and we do believe that action needs to be swift."" ""People have to have confidence in their government that those records will be protected."" he said. The list was anonymously distributed last week to media and government offices across the state, CNN affiliate KSTU-TV reported. An accompanying letter from ""Concerned Citizens of the United States"" insisted that those on the list should be deported immediately. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert told CNN's John King on Friday night that the 1,300 people have Hispanic names. Shurtleff said the alleged crimes may have broken both state and federal privacy laws, and some may have been felonies, so if appropriate, it could be a multi-level investigation. He added that crimes may have been committed not only in generating and preparing the list, but also in how the list was used. Some of the alleged illegal immigrants listed have reported harassment since their names appeared on the list. ""Clearly, it's not even meant as a blacklist. It's more like a hit list. It is, I think, to put people at fear, to terrorize, to get people mobilized to do things. The fact is, the names on that list are also innocent until proven guilty and we're finding that some of those names ... are here legally,"" Shurtleff said. The Utah Department of Workforce Services said Friday it had identified at least two employees believed to be involved in creating the 29-page list. ""At this point we don't think it was a very large conspiracy. We think it was two, maybe. We have suspicion of a couple of more people, a very small group,"" said Kristen Cox, the department's executive director. The state focused on the Department of Workforce Services, Herbert's office said Thursday, because all of the information on the list -- including contact information, Social Security numbers and pregnancy due dates -- is contained within that agency's database. Those named on the list are even more frightened, Jesus Ramos with the Utah Coalition of La Raza said last week. ""For these 1,300 people, unfortunately, that fear has escalated,"" he said. ""There's an arrest warrant out, essentially. That fear never goes away."" Herbert said Friday, ""Some are scared and apprehensive. I understand that. I expect that comes with the status of being illegal. If I was in the country illegally, I would probably have fear and apprehension, too."" Shurtleff said Monday it's time to put aside rhetoric and work on a solution to the immigration issue. Herbert has plans to bring together what he called a ""spectrum"" of viewpoints, some ""diametrically opposed,"" for a round-table discussion on immigration reform in Utah on Tuesday. ""We see what's happened in Arizona,"" he said Friday. ""So Utah, like other states right now, are saying if the federal government is not going to do something, we will take steps to do something ourselves within the parameters of the law. It may mean creating (a) new law."" CNN's Mark Morgenstein contributed to this report .","NEW: Utah questioning eight more Dept. of Workforce Services employees .

"(CNN) -- Frigid temperatures threatened Florida citrus crops as much of the Southeast into plunged into the teens Monday morning. State capital Tallahassee had plunged to 16 degrees by 5:25 a.m. ET, while temperatures in the 30s or below could be found well south of Orlando. The cold made Florida cities like Winter Haven anything but. The National Weather Service issued a hard freeze warning that extended as far south as Lake Okeechobee. Normally immune to the cold of winter, temperatures in Miami barely got into the 40s on Sunday; normally, they'd be in the 70s. Share your cold weather stories, photos . But the biggest news about the big chill is coming from the northern part of Florida, where a hard freeze watch is in effect, CNN's meteorologist Bonnie Schneider said. That could be bad news for citrus trees that rarely survive when temperatures remain in the mid-20s or below for four hours or longer, according to Kristen Gunter, a spokeswoman for the association of companies that pick and process the oranges. Some groves in the northern part of the growing area sustained substantial damage Saturday night and Sunday morning, when temperatures dipped to 28 degrees or lower for at least six hours, said Andrew Meadows, spokesman for Florida Citrus Mutual, a group representing about 8,000 citrus growers in the state. It will take about five weeks to quantify the losses, he said. Florida citrus is a $9.3 billion industry. The state produces three-quarters of the United States' orange crop and 40 percent of the world's orange juice supply. ""[Sunday night] will be the night to watch, because if things don't go well, the entire economy will be affected, jobs could be lost if fruit on the ground cannot be harvested, workers will go elsewhere in the U.S., and Florida will lose,"" Gunter said. The citrus harvest is at its peak right now, she said, and workers are already grinding away seven days a week as it is. ""I'm not sure we can work any faster,"" Gunter said.","Temperature in Tallahassee drops to 18 on Monday morning .

"Washington (CNN) -- Like a couple renewing their vows, U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron once again reaffirmed the ""special relationship"" between the United States and the United Kingdom during a joint press conference at the White House on Tuesday. Calling it an ""opportunity to renew the relationship with my partner, Prime Minister Cameron,"" Obama also claimed the U.S. has ""no closer ally, no stronger partner."" ""We can never say it enough, the United States and the United Kingdom enjoy a truly special relationship,"" Obama said at that the start of the press conference calling the meeting a ""brilliant start as partners who see eye-to-eye on virtually every challenge before us."" Cameron, on his first visit to the White House, had similar sentiments, saying the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is not just ""an extraordinary special relationship. ""To me, it is also an absolutely essential relationship if we are going to deliver the security and the prosperity that our people need."" The two men appear serious about this commitment.  In fact, Obama has used the term ""special relationship"" with only one other country, Israel. In addition to the formalities of the day, the president and first lady presented gifts to the prime minister and wife, Samantha, and their children. According to the White House, ""President and Mrs. Obama gave the Prime Minister and Mrs. Cameron a framed and signed color lithograph by Edward Ruscha titled 'Column with Speed Lines.'

"London, England (CNN) -- Turkey has reacted angrily to a U.S. congressional panel decision to pass a resolution calling the 1915 killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey a genocide. Turkey recalled its envoy to the United States and condemned the narrow 23-22 vote in favor by the House Foreign Affairs Committee recommending that the US recognize the killings as genocide. Here two experts on Turkey -- Dr Katerina Dalacoura, lecturer in International Relations at the London School of Economics and Fadi Hakura, Turkey Analyst at Chatham House, a London-based think tank -- explain why this is such an emotional issue for the country. Why is this a sensitive issue for Turkey? Dalacoura: It has always been a sensitive issue... Turkey has always refused to accept that it was a planned event. They argue that genocide only applies if it was a plan to exterminate people. Hakura: Turkey says ""yes, Armenians did die,"" but disputes the historical definition as a genocide... It says they died in war, of disease, from the general chaos at the time, but the deaths were not part of a deliberate systematic plan to eliminate the Armenians. They say that intention is an important part of genocide. Why did the House Foreign Affairs Committee vote on this now? Hakura: On April 24 each year the president of the U.S. makes a traditional statement commemorating the 1915 killings and I suspect the timing of this is related to that. Could this harm US-Turkey relations? Hakura: If the resolution was passed then it could cause lasting damage... although this is not the first time the two countries have been through this. In 2007 the recommendation vote was 27-21 so the vote has narrowed this time. Hillary Clinton (U.S. secretary of state) says that passing the resolution would damage U.S./Turkey relations, although I think this is a fig leaf and the real reason is U.S. national security. Turkey is militarily important to the U.S.... it has a military base at Incirlik and in February several senior defense staff signed a letter asking for the resolution to be withdrawn. Dalacoura: U.S.-Turkey relations have been going through a relative low in the last few years... there is less warmth in the relationship, but the relationship has been strong for a decade and is very strong on a variety of issues and Turkey will deal with it now. Do any countries recognize the killing of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 as genocide? Hakura: Twenty countries do, including France, Germany, Sweden and Canada. Ronald Reagan in 1981 is the only U.S. president who asked for the killings to be called a genocide. What is the public opinion in Turkey regarding the Armenian massacre? Dalacoura: Relations between the military and the government is the key issue for many Turks, I think this (Armenia massacre) is a secondary issue. Hakura: Turkey is becoming more and more liberal... genocide is no longer a taboo word when it comes to talking about Armenia and things have been progressing, but the population does not like foreign powers defining their history, it generates a lot of misgivings. Could this reverse the tentative measures Turkey and Armenia have taken to normalize relations? Dalacoura: It depends on how profound the event is... although it is one of many events. The relationship with Turkey is a new one and the Turkish government has invested in it.","Analysts explain why 1915 killing of Armenians remains emotive issue .

"(CNN) -- ""I hate my dreams. They're so ... infantile."" Heaven knows what artist Laurie Anderson would make of Christopher Nolan's first film since ""The Dark Knight,"" but if audiences don't go for it, we're more likely to hear a different complaint: It's just too darned complex. A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolan's own original screenplay, ""Inception"" is the smartest CGI head-trip since ""The Matrix."" The premise is so out-there, it requires not just a leap of faith but also too much screen time to explain, so do yourself a favor and pay attention. Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb, an ""excavator,"" who digs around in people's subconscious while they're catching some zzzzs. This act of infiltration is ""not strictly legal""; the motive is not therapeutic but espionage and theft. It's also not a solo operation. To do the job properly requires an ""architect,"" basically someone to design an appropriate dreamscape, something vivid and detailed enough to keep the dreamer's defenses down. Depending on the complexity of the project, it might also require a ""burglar,"" a ""chemist"" and preferably someone on the outside to administer a well-timed wake up call. Cobb's partners include Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a newbie, Ariadne (Ellen Page); Yusuf (Dileep Rao); and Eames (Tom Hardy). Their client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants more than access to a rival industrialist's grey matter; he requires Cobb to plant an idea in there that will dismantle an entire conglomerate. As if that weren't hard enough, Cobb is also plagued with keeping his own demons at bay, in the form of an angry dead wife (Marion Cotillard). DiCaprio evidently hasn't got ""Shutter Island"" out of his system yet. A kind of meta-heist movie, ""Inception"" evokes Philip K. Dick's cerebral sci-fi, the exploration of alternate states of consciousness, memory and fantasy. But these are also Nolan's themes, familiar from the amnesiac noir of ""Memento"" and the many, varied mind-games practiced by the warring magicians in ""The Prestige"" as well as the psychological warfare between Batman and his adversaries (fans of that series will recognize several familiar faces popping up here). ""An idea is like a virus,"" says Cobb, and that idea too might have been born in Gotham City or in the rabid enthusiasm that greeted ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige,"" ""Inception"" is constructed as a box of tricks. Ariadne (who helped Theseus slay the minotaur in Greek mythology) devises labyrinths that are also escape hatches, and that metaphor of the maze runs through ""Inception,"" which is itself a puzzle to be navigated by filmmaker and audience alike. In the course of probing his subject's subconscious, Cobb escorts him into a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream. If it's a little disappointing that each level plays out as a straight-up action thriller (this guy really should get out more), the rules of this game are delightfully devious. iReport: Share your review of ""Inception"" He has a tendency to over-complicate, but nobody bends time more ingeniously than Nolan. Three minutes in one dream might correspond to an hour in the next, and both transpire in a matter of seconds up in the real world. Gloriously, real world physics are refracted in the dream zones -- gravity just drops out like a faulty signal -- and if the dreamer starts to stir, the universe crumbles. (The Big One: the ultimate Angeleno nightmare.) It certainly hasn't escaped Nolan's attention that this dream life functions as a metaphor for the movies. Ariadne is a production designer, Cobb an actor-director. Extras in the dream -- ordinary passers-by -- are known as ""projections,"" and they become hostile if they suspect that someone is messing with their reality. ""Inception"" only dabbles in the art of perception. For all its layering, the movie's depth remains on the surface. But with its grand, clanging Hans Zimmer score, its immense, dazzling effects and audacious storytelling, it's the summer's best bet to bust the blocks.","""Inception"" is a spectacular fantasy thriller based on director Christopher Nolan's screenplay .

"(CNN) -- Many Zune owners successfully revived their failed music players Thursday morning, while others were still unable to overcome a leap year-related glitch that caused thousands of the devices to simultaneously stop working on New Year's Eve. Microsoft issued the first Zune portable music player in 2006 to compete with the iPod. ""Mine is back up and working as of a minute ago! Thanks Zune Team,"" a user named ""blcknwhte"" posted at 9:19 a.m. ET on the Zune Web site's forum. ""I'm glad things are back to normal but this was a major inconvenience,"" posted someone named JaximFlash. ""I have 2 Zune 30s and I had made a playlist of songs to play during a New Year's Eve party."" Microsoft Corp., maker of the Zune, said a bug in the internal clock driver, related to the way the device handles a leap year, caused the malfunction in older Zune 30GB models. Matt Akers of the Zune Product Team wrote Wednesday on Zune.net that the problem should resolve itself after 7 a.m. ET Thursday. The Zune support page says users should allow the internal battery to fully drain, then recharge by connecting the Zune to a computer or AC power after noon GMT (7 a.m. ET) on New Year's Day. ""Once the battery has sufficient power, the player should start normally. No other action is required -- you can go back to using your Zune!"" the site says. But some Zune owners still reported problems rebooting their MP3 players Thursday. ""It's 9:15 a.m. [ET] and my Zune is looking just like it did yesterday,"" posted one user. ""Went through the proper steps and still no go. Anybody have any ideas?"" ""Mine doesn't work either, and yes, I can read and follow instructions. I did so three times,"" posted another Zune owner at 10:17 a.m. ET. ""I then called tech support, they told me to charge it for 3 hours, and if that didn't work to call them back."" The mysterious problem surfaced late Tuesday and early Wednesday as Internet message boards were flooded with complaints about Zunes freezing, prompting Y2K-like speculation about end-of-year hardware or software problems. ""It seems that every Zune on the planet has just frozen up and will not work,"" posted a Mountain Home, Idaho, user on CNN's iReport.com. ""I have 3 and they all in the same night stopped working."" Another iReporter said he was working the night shift at a Toys R Us store in Puerto Rico when his Zune player and the Zunes of four co-workers all failed about 1:30 a.m. ET Wednesday. iReport.com: They all froze up . ""It froze and there was no way to turn it off so you just have to wait until the batteries went dead. You can't push any buttons or anything,"" Carlos Colon told CNN. Some Zune users dubbed the crisis ""Y2K9"" or ""Z2K9,"" a reference to New Year's Eve and concerns over potential widespread computer failures on January 1, 2000 -- fears that proved unfounded. Microsoft says it will keep users posted via the tech-support page on http://www.zune.net/en-us/support/zune30.htm.

"New York (CNN) -- A leading opponent of a proposed mosque and community center near Ground Zero is asking a question that looms as large as the towers that stood nearby less than nine years ago: ""Why there?"" Pamela Geller, a conservative blogger who leads a group called Stop the Islamicization of America, posed the question on CNN's ""American Morning"" Wednesday. ""We feel that it is a cemetery and sacred ground and the dead should be honored,"" Geller said. ""To build a 13-story mega mosque on the cemetery, on the site of the largest attack in American history, I think, is incredibly insensitive."" Those for and against the proposed mosque butted heads during a passionate three-hour hearing of New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission Tuesday night. Officially, the hearing was a forum for testimony on whether the building at 45-47 Park Place, near Ground Zero, is worth preserving. The structure dates back to the late 1850s. Preservation Commission spokeswoman Elisabeth de Bourbon said the building housed the headquarters of the Merck pharmaceutical company in the 1920s and in more recent years served as a discount clothing store. She said she was not sure what the current owner -- the Muslim outreach group the Cordoba Initiative -- has been doing with the building, but people attending Tuesday night's meeting said it was being used for prayer services. The commission is expected to vote in August on whether to grant the structure landmark status, even though the Community Board of lower Manhattan said earlier this month the building wasn't architecturally significant enough to merit the designation. De Bourbon said landmark status alone would not prevent the Cordoba Initative from making alterations to the existing structure or making it into an Islamic cultural center. While the designation is designed to preserve the exterior appearance of a building in New York, it does not restrict the use of a building, nor does it prevent a property owner from adding on floors, she said. Even if the building on Park Place is declared a landmark, ""changes can be made to a landmark building with approval from the Landmark Preservation Commission,"" de Bourbon said. In fact, there are examples in New York where buildings with landmark status were drastically altered. The Hearst Magazine building, a modern 46-story skyscraper in Manhattan, rises out of a six-story Depression-era, Art Deco facade with landmark status. The original design was for a skyscraper, but construction came to a halt when the Great Depression hit. In the latter half of the 20th century, the Landmark Preservation Commission approved a plan to add on the modern skyscraper while preserving the original facade. Supporters of the Park Place preservation are opposed to a project by the Cordoba Initiative and the American Society for Muslim Advancement to build their mosque and community center so close to the site where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed by Islamist hijackers on September 11, 2001. The contentious nature of the hearing was expected, because if the commission rules the structure now at the site doesn't deserve the landmark status, the groups behind the project won't need any additional city permission to demolish the old building and move ahead with the mosque construction. Voices opposing the mosque dominated the hearing. ""It would be a terrible mistake to destroy a 154-year-old building in order to build a monument to terrorism,"" one woman said. Some at the hearing, including Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Lazio, expressed suspicion about Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who heads the Cordoba Initiative. Feisal was out of the country and did not attend the hearing. Lazio called for an investigation into its funding. ""We're asking for a delay in the process to get some answers,"" Lazio said. The heckling and intense nature of the hearing got to be too much for some participants. ""I'm ashamed to be an American today,"" said Rakif Gathwari, a Muslim-American, who reminded the crowd that people from many countries and religions died on September 11. ""I want to prove to this hall that I am a citizen,"" Gathwari said, holding up his passport. Some Muslim community leaders say the mosque could provide an opportunity for improving interfaith relations. ""We're saying Muslims have a legitimate role to play in the social fabric of this country,"" said Ibrahim Ramey, the director of the Human and Civil Rights Division of the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation, on CNN's ""American Morning"" Wednesday. ""We are part of the interfaith mosaic of the United States. But more than that, I think this particular group of people in the Cordoba Institute can do a huge amount of good not only for Muslims in New York but also for interfaith relations throughout the country,"" Ramey added. The Cordoba Initiative says it aims to improve relations between Muslims and the West. ""The Cordoba Initiative hopes to build a $100 million, 13-story community center with Islamic, interfaith and secular programming, similar to the 92nd Street Y,"" its website says, referring to the cultural institution on the upper east side of Manhattan. The project calls for a mosque, a performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is preparing to announce new rules allowing some travel to Cuba, along with an expanded ability for Americans to send economic assistance, a senior U.S. official and congressional sources said Wednesday. According to two congressional aides briefed informally on the plans, the administration is expected to announce ""soon"" that it will essentially reinstate measures that were in place under the Clinton administration. Both aides stressed that the administration is still working through the details and legal language. ""It's a return to Clinton, plus some,"" one aide said, noting that President George W. Bush tightened restrictions on travel and cultural exchanges. The central component of the policy involves ""people to people"" exchanges that would allow academics, corporations, humanitarian groups and athletic teams to travel to Cuba. The administration is not lifting tourist travel limits or the strict trade restrictions currently in place but would promote cultural exchanges and programs with universities or allow U.S. farms to send assistance to Cuban farmers as part of the new rules. One of the aides who supports the changes stressed that the goal is to allow travel for people to help Cubans build their own economy and culture. The policy is ""to go down there, give a message of hope, to help the Cuban people forge their own future as they want, not necessarily as the way another government wants."" In addition, the administration is planning to expand the policy it announced last year that allowed Cuban-Americans to send ""remittances"" or economic support to family members in Cuba. The new regulations would allow any U.S. citizen, as well as universities, churches and businesses, to send money or sponsor a partner in Cuba. There would be a cap on the amount of money that could be sent. The new policy would make it easier for universities, sports teams and businesses to set up exchanges. The State Department would shift its current policy, which now denies visas for Cubans to travel to the U.S., to one that gives a ""presumption of approval"" unless a review discovers a problem with the request. Although the administration cannot change current travel restrictions without congressional approval, it does have the authority to loosen visa rules . The congressional aides expected the administration to unveil the changes through a statement by the president or the secretary of state, along with text of the new regulations. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that although he had nothing to announce, ""our overarching goal here is to encourage a more open environment in Cuba and increased respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. And, consistent with that objective, we've promoted measures to encourage the free flow of information and humanitarian items to the Cuban people."" Likewise, White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton gave no details in response to reporters' questions Tuesday but added, ""the president is going to continue to do things that are in the best interest of the United States and that help to create a more democratic environment and expand freedoms for the Cuban people."" CNN Senior State Department Producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Sources say the administration will soon loosen rules regarding Cuba .

"(CNN) -- The Nevada State Board of Nursing has suspended the licenses of two nurses named by police in a criminal investigation of ""disrupted"" catheter lines at a hospital neonatal intensive care unit, the board's executive director said Wednesday. The two nurses, identified in board documents as Jessica May Rice and Sharon Ochoa-Reyes, have not been arrested or charged with a crime, but the nursing board found that the results of the ongoing police investigation warranted the license suspensions. Nursing board director Debra Scott said that Rice, a nurse for four years, and Ochoa-Reyes, a nurse for 19 years, worked at Las Vegas' Sunrise Hospital, where hospital officials and police had been investigating several incidents in which catheters had been ""disrupted."" The incidents involved peripherally inserted central catheters, or PICC lines, Sunrise Hospital said in a statement last week. The specialized catheters provide long-term access to a vein and are used to provide nutrition, give medication or draw blood, the statement said. The hospital launched an internal review in February, concentrating on ""product performance and staff education,"" the statement said, and no disruptions were reported for several weeks. After another one occurred, the hospital retained a plastics engineer with an independent lab to evaluate the lines. The facility then discovered that another kind of catheter, an umbilical arterial catheter, also had been disrupted. Such catheters have a low failure rate, the hospital said. Hospital officials increased security and installed cameras as part of their review. They also contacted Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and regulatory agencies, including the Nevada State Board of Nursing and the state Department of Health and Human Services. There were two ""unexpected outcomes"" involving the infant patients at the unit, the hospital statement said. ""One patient required an additional procedure and is currently doing well,"" the statement said. ""The second patient remains in critical condition in the neonatal intensive care unit."" Law enforcement officials notified the nursing board last month that Ochoa-Reyes and Rice were part of their investigation into the problems at Sunrise, Scott said. The board took quick action to suspend the women's licenses. According to the legal summary suspension of license documents, police found that the Sunrise incidents involved ""intentional patient harm."" The documents for each nurse say the board found in both cases that the nurse violated the Nevada Nurse Practice Act, with those violations including engaging ""in conduct likely to deceive, defraud or endanger a patient or the general public."" The board found that it ""would be a danger to the public health, safety or welfare"" for the nurses to have unrestricted licenses and that suspension of the licenses required emergency action. Accordingly, the board suspended the licenses. Attempts to reach Ochoa-Reyes and Rice Wednesday evening were unsuccessful. In all, 14 catheters were ""disrupted"" at the neonatal intensive care unit, the hospital said. A hospital spokeswoman would not provide further comment Wednesday. Police were referring questions to the hospital.","NEW: 1 baby is critical after catheters were ""disrupted"" in neonatal intensive care unit .

"(CNN) -- A body found near where a California teen vanished last week on her way home from summer school was confirmed Wednesday to be that of 17-year-old Norma Lopez, a Riverside County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. The identification was made through dental records, according to Sgt. Joe Barja. Authorities are now treating the case as a homicide investigation, and are searching for any witnesses or information leading to a suspect. Barja declined to reveal the cause of death or reveal any injuries Lopez may have sustained. Lopez was last seen Thursday leaving summer class at Valley View High School in Moreno Valley, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles. She had planned to meet her younger sister and a friend at home. It is believed Lopez, who would have been a senior in the fall, took a short cut through a dirt field to reach the family's residence. Her sister contacted the police when Lopez never returned home. The body was discovered around 3 p.m. Tuesday, said Deputy Melissa Nieburger of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. Nieburger said the body was found about two miles from where Lopez vanished. Police are looking for a green ""SUV type vehicle"" that was seen driving away from the area at the time of Lopez's disappearance. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","Norma Lopez, 17, disappeared last Thursday .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a missing Shreveport, Louisiana, girl said Tuesday that one of two men suspected in her daughter's disappearance spent time at their home, playing video games and hanging out with their family. Henry Lee was ""always very polite, very nice. We thought he was a very decent person,"" Karen White, the mother of missing 12-year-old Amber White, told HLN's ""Prime News."" ""We would have never ever expected that he would have done something like this."" Lee, 24, was arrested Monday on aggravated kidnapping charges, according to Shreveport police. A second man, Brandon Player, 19, was also arrested Monday in the case and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. White said Tuesday that Lee was an ""associate"" of one of her family's good friends. Police are searching for any clues into the whereabouts of Amber, who was last seen Sunday after she went to the neighborhood pool. However, it started raining shortly after she left her house, her mother said. ""My husband realized it was raining and he went down to get her and she was gone,"" Karen White said. Two witnesses told police they had seen her get into an Oldsmobile Cutlass, according to Shreveport police Sgt. Bill Goodin. The witnesses were able to provide authorities with a license plate number, and police tracked the car to Player. ""Through interviews and other information gathering, that ultimately led us to Henry Lee,"" Goodin told ""Prime News."" Goodin said police don't believe an ""abduction"" occurred, but added that investigators aren't ruling anything out as they search for Amber. Karen White described her daughter as a good kid who never fails to check in with her parents. ""I think she was coerced to get into a car,"" White said. ""I don't think she did it on her own. The daughter that I know would not do something like this."" Player has been released from police custody on bond. Lee remained in jail Tuesday night.","Amber White, 12, was last seen Sunday heading to her neighborhood pool .

"(CNN) -- NASA said Wednesday that it is collaborating with recording artist Mary J. Blige to encourage girls and young women to pursue careers by studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- collectively known as STEM. A public service announcement featuring shuttle astronaut Leland Melvin and Blige will begin running this week on NASA TV and on the agency's website. The campaign is part of NASA's Summer of Innovation program, which also is working with Blige's Foundation for the Advancement of Women Now, the space agency said. The NASA program, part of the president's Educate to Innovate Campaign, started this summer with the aim of engaging middle school students in science-related activities during the summer break. Working with Blige's foundation provides ""a rare opportunity"" for it to reach ""communities not always readily accessible to us,"" Melvin said in a news release. ""Mary's presence can help NASA make the STEM message more appealing to these communities and increase the pipeline of underrepresented students going into these disciplines,"" he said. High school participants in Blige's foundation are working with the NASA Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Aerospace Academy project at York College of the City University of New York, the space agency said. In addition to being prepared to deliver NASA content to middle school students this summer, they will have the opportunity to support the NASA academy's fall academic session as student aides for grades one through nine, it said.","NASA collaborating with recording artist Mary J.

"Porter Holder vividly remembers the day in 1998 when he left a U.S. Department of Agriculture loan office in Oklahoma empty-handed. He had applied for a low-interest USDA loan to help keep a farm in family ownership. He says he expected his application to be accepted. He had kept his debt at a minimum and developed a plan for supplementing his income. He believes he was turned down because he's Native American, a member of the Choctaw tribe. ""The day I walked out of there, I knew why he denied me,"" Holder said. In 1999, He joined other Native Americans in a class-action lawsuit that accused the USDA of discriminatory lending over a 25-year period. USDA loans can be used for purchasing land, livestock, equipment and other operational items. The lending practices of USDA regional offices have cost Native American farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue, their lawyers said, although they added that it's a hard number to estimate because of how many farmers may have been affected. The attorneys say their expert witness, agricultural economist Patrick O'Brien, estimated that over 18 years, Native American farmers received only half the loans they could have expected to obtain. As a result, many saw their farms foreclosed on and their fields lying fallow. A recent settlement on behalf of African-American farmers gave Native Americans hope that their case will also be resolved in their favor. Individual black farmers could receive $50,000 each as a result of the case, known as Pigford II. According to the 2007 Census of Agriculture, there are about 60,000 Native American farmers in the United States -- double the number of African-American farmers. The vast majority of Native American farmers work on family-operated farms. Holder lives on 320 gently rolling acres in Oklahoma, where he raises cattle. His primary source of income is work as a blacksmith, shoeing horses in his community. With the right amount of financial help, he said, his life could have been different. ""I could have been a rancher,"" he said. ""That's what I wanted to do."" Holder said regional USDA offices repeatedly denied him access to loans. In one instance, he said he was told to ""go see [his] tribe."" After the regional office denied him a loan at 4 percent interest, Porter said he received an 8 percent interest loan through a private bank. He purchased the acres he lives on now, but he said the high interest has put a strain on his finances. ""If it was fair, I would be in a different place,"" he said. ""I am thankful to be where I am, don't get me wrong, but I would be in a different place."" The Native Americans' lead counsel, Joseph Sellers, said the USDA loans are vital to the existence of Native American farmers. ""The precondition to getting these kinds of loans is the USDA is regarded as the lender of last resort,"" he said. ""So the people who get these loans have already demonstrated that they can't get loans at two commercial lending institutions. So if they don't get credit from the USDA, they get credit from no one."" O'Brien, formerly with the USDA research service, agreed, saying that USDA loan programs were ""limited to operators who cannot obtain sufficient credit at reasonable rates elsewhere but who would be able to operate viable farm businesses if USDA made the loan(s) in question."" Claryca Mandan says farming is in her blood. Her family was named its county's Farming Family of the Year in 1968. She says credit became almost impossible to get around the time she married her husband, Keith, in 1979. Like Holder, she is Native American and said she remembers when the loan practices of her local USDA office took what she called ""an aggressive stance."" Mandan, who was a borrower from the USDA for years, is now a plaintiff in the lawsuit against it. ""It became apparent we were receiving different treatment,"" she said. ""We were given loan amounts that were lesser than we already requested, and we were encouraged to buy the oldest machinery instead of stuff adequate and [the] equivalent to white farmers. We started to receive a lot of resistance from the local county staff."" Mandan said the regional office's stance toward lending was aimed not only at putting Native American farmers at a disadvantage, but at benefiting their non-Native American counterparts. Many Native American farms are on land -- usually in reservations -- that the federal government holds in trusts for the benefit of future generations. The land falls under tribal government authority, but Mandan charged that as more Native American farms defaulted on loans from the government, more farms were offered by the federal government for purchase to farmers who were not Native Americans. A 1997 report from a civil rights action team to the USDA on the treatment of minority farmers generally, cited in the lawsuit, said that as minority farmers were unable to afford their lands, ""The land is lost finally and sold at auction, where it is bought by someone else at half the price being asked of the minority farmer. Often it is alleged that the person was a friend or relative of one of [the USDA's Farm Service Administration] county officials."" The Mandans are members of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, also known as Three Affiliated Tribes. The couple still resides on land that was allocated by the Dawes General Allotment Act of 1887, which aimed at settling Native American tribes and turning them into farmers and ranchers. Mandan, who now works as a Native American credit outreach counselor, said she and her family struggled without access to affordable credit. After she failed to secure a USDA loan, the Mandans raised four children in a two-bedroom mobile home for 12 years. Without proper loans, she said, she couldn't afford a larger home. It wasn't until 2007 that she moved her family into what she felt was adequate housing, purchased through a local housing authority. Ultimately, Mandan said, they won't be able to hand down working farms to their children. ""We aren't able to pass on farms with buildings and irrigation. A lot of us just have the bare land with fences. Many of us don't even have buildings,"" she said. ""Many of us just finally achieved standard housing. For this to be happening in the U.S. today, with an agency that was supposed to fund us equally, is just wrong."" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a recent statement to CNN that the USDA is ""committed to resolving allegations of past discrimination because we are intent on ensuring every farmer and rancher is treated equally and fairly. We have made significant progress on addressing USDA's civil rights record to close this chapter in the department's history."" USDA officials told CNN that they are in settlement discussions with Native American farmers and that they are putting the final touches on a plan that would turn the page on the discrimination claims by Hispanic and women farmers, as well. ""We want to put this behind us and focus on the future,"" a USDA official said. ""We want to make sure we have a strong foundation moving forward."" Farmers such as George Keepseagle, for whom the case is named, have seen the years pass since the lawsuit was filed. In the 12 years that he and his wife, Marilyn, have been plaintiffs in the case, his health has deteriorated significantly because of stress, he said. Keepseagle, who is 70, was forced to sell his farm years ago. The couple now lives on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota and said they want to change the way the USDA services loans to minority communities. They said they are optimistic, but Marilyn admits that George has misgivings. ""He worries a lot. He worries more than I do,"" she said. ""I support him, I encourage him, I tell him it's not the end of the world and something good should come out of this."" For Porter Holder, the lawsuit isn't about the money; it's about the future for his four young daughters. ""I hope to see fairness in Oklahoma,"" he said. ""I hope to see that it doesn't matter, the color of your skin, or nationality, if you're trying to make a productive living. This goes back to 1700; some things just don't change -- it's time.""","Native American farmers say USDA loan practices were discriminatory .
