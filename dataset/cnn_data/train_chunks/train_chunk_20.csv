"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A visit to the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty and the Pyramids is on the itinerary of most jet-setting travelers. Visiting the Eiffel Tower was voted the most overrated experience by tourists. But some of the most famous and iconic tourist attractions in the world are the most disappointing to actually visit, according to a survey of British tourists. And those questioned didn't think too highly of their own country's best-known landmarks either, with Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain also turning people cold. Travel expert Felice Hardy explained why many tourists, often after spending inflated amounts on reaching and then viewing the most famous places, are left with a feeling of anti-climax. ""It's easy to be swayed by brochures that opt for the mainstream and focus on clichéd tourist sights around the world,"" she said. ""But many of them are overcrowded and disappointing. ""Pick carefully and don't always go for the obvious. Natural phenomena are usually more exciting than the man-made, and can be wonderfully free of tourists."" The Eiffel Tower -- described by Hardy as ""frustratingly overcrowded and overpriced"" -- was dubbed the most disappointing international sight. Britain's biggest letdown was Stonehenge, a sacred Druid sight in the rural south of England, which was dismissed as ""an isolated pile of rocks in a usually muddy field"" by Hardy. The Diana fountain resembled ""a colorless wet skateboard park"" while as far as Big Ben was concerned: ""Once you've seen it, you'll know what time it is -- time to go somewhere else."" Three of America's most famous sights -- New York's Times Square and Statue of Liberty plus The White House in Washington also made the list of shame. But the 1,267 adults questioned by Virgin Travel Insurance also nominated the best places to visit in the world, with the Treasury in the ancient city of Petra in Jordan topping the list. Other unmissables included the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, the Masai Mara game reserve in Kenya and Australia's Sydney Harbor Bridge.

"(CNN) -- A man who faked his drowning death nearly 20 years ago off a Florida beach was found out by North Carolina police who stopped him for a traffic violation, authorities said Thursday. Bennie Wint told police he faked his drowning death in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1989. Bennie Wint left behind a grieving fiancee and a daughter from a previous marriage. Over the past two decades, he acquired a common-law wife and another child in Marshall, North Carolina. Wint told police he faked his death in Daytona Beach, Florida, because he was ""paranoid"" about his narcotics-related activity at the time, Weaverville, North Carolina, police Sgt. Stacy Wyatt told CNN. When pulled over in Weaverville on Saturday because of malfunctioning lights on his license plate, the man said his name was James Sweet, Wyatt said. But when Wyatt ran the name through official databases, he was unable to find any information. ""I found it suspicious and believed it to be a false name,"" Wyatt said. He arrested the man on suspicion of driving without a license and giving false information, both misdemeanor offenses, and booked him under the name ""John Doe."" But ""John Doe"" finally opened up to Wyatt, admitting he was really Bennie Wint and had been on the run since 1989.  Watch how reports of his death were premature » . Wint returned a call Thursday from CNN and asked what an interview with him would be ""worth to you."" Told that CNN does not pay for interviews, he responded, ""Unless you want to pay for it, don't come up here. You are wasting your time. There are 'no trespassing' signs on my property."" He then hung up. According to police reports, Wint was on a trip to Daytona Beach with his then-fiancee, Patricia Hollingsworth. She told police they were engaged and had discussed getting married while on the trip. But it was not to be. On September 25, 1989, Hollingsworth told beach patrol officials that Wint disappeared while swimming. ""We spent a bunch of time looking for him,"" said Volusia County Beach Patrol Capt. Scott Petersohn, who was on the beach patrol at the time, although he did not respond to the call. ""We used helicopters, boats and boatloads of lifeguards."" Hollingsworth, then 37, told officials Wint entered the ocean about 4 p.m. and swam past the breakers before she lost sight of him, according to the incident report. The report notes Hollingsworth was ""very upset"" and that after contacting officials, she ""began to run north and south in the area,"" looking for Wint. Members of the beach patrol, however, thought the supposed drowning was suspicious. ""It is very rare to drown offshore and not wash back in onto the shore,"" Petersohn said. In addition, he said, the lifeguard on the beach told officials he did not see anyone swimming in the area. Wyatt submitted Wint's fingerprints to the FBI for identification and, while waiting for the results, searched the Internet for information on a Bennie Wint. ""I found a daughter that was looking for him,"" Wyatt said. The woman posted information about her father in 2007, saying he went missing under suspicious circumstances. Wyatt contacted the now-23-year-old woman, who said she was 4 when her father disappeared. Wint has been released from jail and has not been charged in relation to the 1989 incident. It was not known whether he contacted his daughter. Wyatt said Wint now has a common-law wife, a child and a business selling NASCAR items. The night he was arrested, Wyatt said, his wife was ""distraught"" upon learning his true identity. Wyatt said Wint told him he was involved in narcotics in the 1970s and '80s, and ""he ran out of paranoia, thinking people were out to get him."" He said he went from Daytona Beach to Ozark, Alabama. CNN's attempts to contact Hollingsworth were unsuccessful, and it was unclear whether she knows Wint is alive. Petersohn said he is attempting to find the lifeguard on duty at Daytona Beach the day Wint disappeared to tell him the truth about the supposed drowning. ""For 20 years, that man that works for us thinks he might have missed something in the ocean,"" Petersohn said. ""I'm glad the guy's alive. I really am. ... It's unfortunate the way it went down at the time, people looking for a body that wasn't out there.""","North Carolina officer didn't believe man's story during traffic stop .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Security contractors in Iraq use some over-the-top tactics and overreact at times, a top U.S. general in Iraq said Friday. Members of a private security company prepare the way for a U.S. convoy in Baghdad, Iraq. Many in Iraq have witnessed security contractors operating in a questionable fashion, said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Joseph Anderson, chief of staff for the Multi-National Corps in Iraq. ""I can certainly say I've seen them do some tactics that I thought were over the top. But that's something we've got to keep working out,"" Anderson said in a briefing to Pentagon reporters via teleconference from Iraq. His comments soon after Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he wants closer oversight of Pentagon contractors in Iraq. Gates has dispatched a team there to review accountability and oversight. Anderson did not offer specific examples of incidents he had seen. He agreed security contractors in Iraq have taken a lot of criticism, but he said they are in a tough position. ""They obviously have a tough job to do in a tough environment. I don't know if they're overly aggressive. I think the question becomes what rules do they follow with respect to what the rules of engagement are,"" he said. The actions of private security contractors have come under scrutiny since a Baghdad shooting incident earlier this month. Iraqi authorities say Blackwater guards fired indiscriminately, killing as many as 20 civilians; Blackwater says its employees responded properly to an insurgent attack on a convoy. Under an order laid down by the U.S.-led occupation government in 2004, security contractors are not subject to Iraqi law for actions taken within their contracts, a condition that irritates Iraqi officials. About 137,000 civilians are working for the U.S. military in Iraq, Gates said Wednesday. That number includes at least 7,300 of the estimated 25,000 private security contractors working in Iraq, he said. After the Blackwater shootings, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England issued a memo to commanders in Iraq outlining their responsibility for holding contractors accountable, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. Anderson said the assessment team sent by Gates is getting a feel for how the military employs contractors, to what scale, what functions they're providing and what differentiates between Department of Defense and Department of State contractors in the security role. The State Department also is investigating the role of private security contractors. Ambassador Patrick Kennedy, a management and policy expert, will lead the effort, along with a high-level panel of outside experts, including retired Gen. George Joulwan, former commander of NATO forces in Europe; Stapleton Roy, former U.S. ambassador to China; and Eric Boswell, a former assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wants an interim report by next Friday.  E-mail to a friend .","U.S. general says he's seen private security contractors overreact .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The video is deeply disturbing. Experts attribute long emergency rorom waits mostly to situations no one can control. In it, former CNN Headline News anchor Glenn Beck describes going to the emergency room in intense pain -- so overwhelming, he wept. He says that for two hours, no one gave him pain medication. In fact, he says, no one lifted a finger to help him at all for 40 minutes. Beck says his wife literally held him up in the emergency room, while nurses looked on and chatted about their holidays. He does not identify the hospital. ""I'm in massive, massive pain,"" Beck writes on his Web site. ""This guy, this triage nurse, is 250, 300 pounds, big guy. Not only does he not go to help my wife help me up, he actually had the audacity to stand there and drum his fingers against the door and look at us like, come on, come on, come on.""  Watch the video of Glenn Beck on his sickbed » . The video, which has had more than 800,000 hits on YouTube, brings to mind the case of Edith Rodriguez. Last year, she was on the floor of a Los Angeles hospital emergency room vomiting blood, and witnesses say no one did anything to help her. Her boyfriend actually called 911, which refused to help since she was already in a hospital. Rodriguez died in the emergency room. These cases, while unusual, certainly happen, say emergency room doctors. ""There are truly situations where it's so busy there are sick patients who are waiting. I will admit that,"" says Dr. Assaad Sayah, who runs three emergency rooms for Cambridge Health Alliance in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. ""Ridiculously long wait times are a huge issue,"" says Dr. David Beiser, an emergency medicine physician at the University of Chicago Medical Center. ""Recently we've had over 40 patients in our waiting room. When I was in training [five years ago], it was rare to see more than 20 patients in our waiting room."" Donna Mason, an emergency room nurse for 33 years, says sometimes, she'd have 75 patients waiting for 54 beds -- and she knew very sick patients were in the waiting room needing care. ""The greatest fear of every doctor or nurse is that [a situation like Beck's] is going to happen in our emergency department,"" says Mason, the immediate past president of the Emergency Nurses Association. Released this week, a Harvard University analysis of more than 90,000 U.S. emergency room visits found that one in four heart-attack patients waited 50 minutes or more to be seen by a physician in an emergency room. These experts attributed long waits mostly to situations no one could control -- too many patients and too few beds. But they also acknowledged that ERs could be better organized. Sayah said reorganizing his ERs has led to dramatic decreases in waiting time. ""Beck would've been in a bed in less than two minutes in my hospitals,"" he says. Waiting times are longer for patients who aren't very sick, but even for them, it's better than it used to be. ""The average time from door to physician used to be about an hour. Now it's 21 minutes,"" Sayah said. His staff -- especially those who greet patients -- receive customer service training. ""It's just like the training they give in restaurants or entertainment places -- it's how to be pleasant to people,"" he says. But what if you find yourself in an emergency room that has long waits and nasty employees? Mason and the emergency room doctors have this advice about what not to do while navigating the ER: . 1. Don't forget to call your doctor on the way to the ER . When ER doctors hear from a fellow physician, they listen, says Beiser at the University of Chicago. ""They'll talk to me professionally and put a bug in my ear,"" he says. ""This guy will now be on my radar screen."" 2. Don't use an ambulance unless you really need it . ""There's a myth out there that if you arrive in an ambulance, you'll go straight back to the doctor,"" Mason says. ""But it's not true. If we can see that you can walk, you may get asked to get off that gurney and go to the waiting room."" 3. Don't be quiet . If the triage nurse -- that's who makes the decisions about who needs care first -- isn't helping you, don't stop there, says Sayah. ""Speak up. Say, 'I need to see the person in charge,'"" he says. 4. Don't get angry, and don't lie . While it's important to make yourself heard, it's also important to use basic etiquette. ""We're all human, and usually when people are nice to us, we're nicer back to them,"" Sayah says. Lying about your symptoms -- making them seem worse than they really are in hopes of getting attention faster -- can backfire, says Dr. William Bozeman, an emergency room doctor at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""We have people saying they have crushing sub-sternal chest pain, that they're having a heart attack, when in reality they're trying to get Vicodin for chronic back pain,"" he says. When the staff figures it out, ""They may not be very pleased at all and may not treat you nicely."" 5. Don't forget the phone . If things get really bad, and no one is helping you, look for a house phone, dial zero, and ask for the hospital administrator on call, Sayah says. ""Even the smallest hospitals have a hospital administrator or a patient advocate on call 24/7,"" he says. ""Hospital administrators don't want to hear patients are unhappy. Their job is to break the hurdles and move forward."" Elizabeth Cohen is a correspondent for CNN Medical News. Senior producer Jennifer Pifer contributed to this report.","Experts: Call your doctor on the way to the emergency room .
Don't call an ambulance unless you absolutely need it .
Try to be polite to the ER personnel, and don't lie or misrepresent anything .
As a last resort, call the hospital administrator on call ."
"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- There's a bit of a trend brewing this summer concert season -- put together a couple of big-name acts for a nationwide tour, then record a song together to promote the event. Members of Styx, REO Speedwagon and Journey in 2003. Styx and REO have teamed up for a song and tour. It started with classic rockers REO Speedwagon and Styx, with their ""Can't Stop Rockin' "" tour and single of the same name. Now Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire are getting on the bandwagon. The two horn-heavy bands have recorded three songs especially for their joint 30-city summer tour. It's part of a charity campaign to benefit food banks across the country -- ""Three Songs for Three Cans or Three Dollars."" Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire team up on the new song ""You."" The bands also take a stab at each other's material, with Chicago recording Earth, Wind & Fire's ""I Can't Let You Go"" and Earth, Wind & Fire covering Chicago's ""Wishing You Were Here."" ""The fact that the artists and bands, in this case, are touring together builds excitement with the possibility of the live performance that is exclusive to the tour,"" said Bruce Burch of the University of Georgia's Music Business School. It's ""sort of a 'once in a lifetime' type of attraction that helps to sell concert tickets, merchandise and, hopefully, CDs and downloads."" Concertgoers who contribute three cans of food or donate at least $3 will get a download card to access the tunes. People who don't make the shows will be able to donate online and download the songs at www.ewfandchicago.com. The Web site is expected to launch in early June. ""This is a dream come true,"" said Earth, Wind & Fire's Philip Bailey, who came up with the three-songs promotion. ""We want to invite everyone to help us do our small part to help feed America,"" added Chicago's trumpeter Lee Loughnane. Artists jamming together on stage is nothing new, and occasionally the songs are released as singles -- U2 and B.B. King's ""When Love Comes to Town,"" from the 1988 album and film ""Rattle and Hum,"" for example. Of course, duets promoting two hot artists or bands are hardly new either. Remember Josh Groban and Charlotte Church on ""The Prayer"" or ""Almost Paradise"" by Ann Wilson of Heart and Mike Reno of Loverboy from the ""Footloose"" soundtrack? ""Hip-hop artists have been using duets for some time to reach audiences of both artists,"" Burch said. In some cases, more than two artists collaborate. ""Even before that, country artists used this means to reach a larger audience for both artists,"" he said, noting the collaborations between George Jones and Tammy Wynette, and Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn. The new songs for the 2009 tours flip conventional wisdom. For decades, groups have recorded albums, then gone on tour to promote them. Specifically recording songs to promote a tour featuring a pairing of acts is a new idea -- and possibly one whose time has come, given the re-emergence of singles in the digital download age. Of course, it all depends on the success of the song. In the case of REO Speedwagon and Styx, they've scored a hit with their new tune. It's been riding near the top of the classic rock charts -- the biggest original hit by either band in years. ""The jam ... is just plain, old-school, rock 'n' roll fun,"" REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin said on the band's Web site. Should other bands follow suit and score hits, it might prompt other classic pop artists to join forces not only on tour, but in the studio as well.","REO Speedwagon and Styx have combined for hit and tour .

"(CNN) -- Police hunting for a New Zealand couple who fled the country after a bank mistakenly paid them $NZ10 million (US$6 million) believe they traveled to Hong Kong. Westpac bank paid the couple 1,000 times the amount they asked for. New Zealand authorities have sought help from Interpol in locating the couple who disappeared May 7, two days after an employee error at Westpac bank paid them 100 times the amount they asked for. TVNZ, a CNN television affiliate, named the couple as Leo Gao and his girlfriend Cara Young. Gao owned a petrol station in Rotorua, a lakeside tourist town famous for its hot water springs and bubbling mud pools. Police said Friday that the couple were believed to have traveled to Hong Kong. ""Enquiries to locate those individuals are continuing through Interpol in Hong Kong and official channels in Beijing,"" said Detective Senior Sergeant David Harvey.  Watch as 'millionaires' go on the run » . Police were not confirming the identities of those involved but they were working with the family of one of the individuals named in the media, Harvey said. The family were shocked at their name being associated with the case, he added. TVNZ said the couple applied for an overdraft from Westpac worth up to NZ$100,000 (US$61,000). However, on or about May 5, the bank erroneously put NZ$10 million (US$6.1 million) into their bank account. What would you do in this situation? The next day, the service station closed its doors. And the day after, the couple went missing. TVNZ said Westpac had confirmed that a customer had attempted to unlawfully transfer amounts totaling around $6.7 million (US$4.1 million). Nearly NZ$3 million (US£$1.85 million) had been recovered and the bank was continuing to vigorously pursue the outstanding amount, Westpac Media relations manager Craig Dowling told the station.","Manhunt for couple who fled after bank mistakenly paid them NZ$10 million .

"(CNN)  -- Americans were asked to stop whatever they were doing at 3 p.m. local time Monday to share a minute on Memorial Day and honor those who have died in the cause of freedom. Americans were asked to take one minute at 3 p.m. Monday to pause and reflect on those who died in battle. ""The time 3 p.m. was chosen because it is the time when most Americans are enjoying their freedoms on the national holiday,"" according to the White House Commission on Remembrance. Congress established the National Moment of Remembrance. ""The Moment does not replace traditional Memorial Day events; rather it is an act of national unity in which all Americans, alone or with family and friends, honor those who died for our freedom,"" the Commission on Remembrance said on its Web site. ""It will help to reclaim Memorial Day as the sacred and noble holiday it was meant to be. In this shared remembrance, we connect as Americans."" Observances included an interruption of Major League Baseball games, the pausing of the National Memorial Day Parade in Washington and the National Grocers Association and Food Marketing Institute asking shoppers to pause in stores nationwide to remember the fallen. ""We want our citizens to contemplate the ties that bind us and take a moment to put 'Memorial' back into Memorial Day,"" said Carmella LaSpada, executive director of the Commission on Remembrance. Children touring Washington inspired the idea when LaSpada asked them what Memorial Day meant and they said that's when the swimming pool opens, according to the commission's Web site.","Commission on Remembrance asks Americans to pause, reflect at 3 p.m. Monday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Throughout her career, singer-songwriter Cyndi Lauper has promoted gay and lesbian rights. She has a personal connection to this cause -- her sister is a lesbian -- but she also believes it's a matter of fairness. Cyndi Lauper worked with Cathy Nelson of the Human Rights Campaign to raise awareness of LGBT issues. ""It's always wrong to discriminate,"" the Grammy Award winner said. ""I grew up in the civil rights movement. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now."" With her 2007 and 2008 ""True Colors"" tours, Lauper has helped raise awareness about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights around the country. She said fellow LGBT activist Cathy Nelson especially motivates her. Nelson worked at the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), a national LGBT civil rights organization, and her dedication to those issues runs deep. Fighting for fairness and equality, she said, drives her. ""I'm a lesbian, and I see the issues very personally,"" Nelson said. ""When it deep-down resonates that you don't have the same rights and responsibilities, or people don't view you the same, it can be demoralizing and empowering at the same time."" Nelson's passion for the cause has enabled her to inspire thousands of people across the country to get involved. When she was growing up in rural Illinois, Nelson said, she hadn't imagined following this path. She trained to be a teacher, but on a whim, became a flight attendant with Eastern Airlines to fulfill her ""intense desire to travel."" In the 1980s, she became involved with labor issues through her flight attendant union. That led to working on women's issues with the National Organization of Women in Washington. In 1989, she started working for the HRC. Since then, she has helped bring LGBT rights out of the closet and onto the national stage. Hired to increase the group's membership, Nelson built a strong volunteer network in communities across the nation. HRC had just 12,000 members when Nelson started. Today it has more than 725,000, making it the largest gay and lesbian rights organization in the country. ""Part of my job is getting people to be vocal,"" Nelson said. ""It's important that everyone has an understanding that discrimination is happening every single day against a certain segment of society. And that's just wrong."" In 2007, when Lauper worked with HRC for the ""True Colors"" tour, she and Nelson teamed up to bring gay and straight audiences together on fairness and equality issues. Nelson realized it was also an opportunity to shine the spotlight on an issue she'd worked on for almost a decade -- the passage of a hate crimes bill that would make attacks based on sexual orientation, disability, or gender a federal crime. For Nelson, crimes against LGBT people -- such as the murder of Matthew Shepard -- represent the darkest side of ignorance on these issues. In 2006, more than one in six hate crimes were committed against LGBT individuals, an 18 percent rise over the previous year, according to the FBI. ""I learned from Cathy that hate crimes send fear through a community,"" Lauper said. ""You could die just because of who you are.""  Watch Lauper and Nelson talk about the ""True Colors"" tour to raise awareness » . At every concert, Lauper spoke passionately about the need to pass the bill, and her song, ""True Colors,"" was used in a public service announcement about the legislation. HRC volunteers distributed information at each venue and had postcards on hand for people to send to their legislators. In the end, more than 15,000 people signed postcards, and both houses of Congress passed the bill by wide margins. Although President Bush never signed the bill, Nelson and Lauper have high hopes for it to soon become law. For Nelson, getting so many people engaged was a key achievement. ""The biggest reward for me is when I've played some part in empowering someone to get involved,"" she said. Lauper knows first-hand how convincing Nelson can be.

"(CNN) -- Former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick arrived at his home in Hampton, Virginia, on Thursday morning. Michael Vick, left, arrives at federal court with attorney Billy Martin in Richmond, Viriginia, in 2007. ""He is happy to be reunited with his family,"" said Chris Garrett, a spokesman for Vick. Vick was released from a federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, on Wednesday. He will serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement in Virginia, his publicist Judy Smith said. Vick is a native of Newport News, Virginia.  Watch a panel discuss his release » . Vick, 28, pleaded guilty in August 2007 to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. He could return to professional football as soon as September if reinstated by the NFL, according to the sports agent who negotiated Vick's 10-year, $140 million contract with the Falcons. Meanwhile, Vick's attorneys have said he will work at a Newport News construction firm after his release and he has also agreed to participate in a documentary for $600,000. Last month, a federal bankruptcy judge denied a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan presented by Vick and urged him to offer another plan. The original plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but he said he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much. Santoro suggested Vick's next plan not call for him to keep two houses and three cars, as did the rejected proposal. In testimony, Vick acknowledged committing a ""heinous"" act and said he should have acted more maturely. He said he has been earning 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor in prison. His Falcons salary, he said, was between $10 million and $12 million. He acknowledged failing to handle his money well. After his release, Vick will work with the Humane Society of the United States on anti-dogfighting campaigns, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN Tuesday. Vick will work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting, and on programs to assist young people who have already been involved in the blood sport.  Watch more about Vick's dogs » . Pacelle said the Humane Society was approached by Vick's representatives. He said he has traveled to Kansas twice to meet with the former quarterback, and during the second visit, the two discussed how Vick could use his sway over youths to discourage them from involvement in dogfighting, as well as help those who were apprehended in connection with it. Details have not yet been hammered out, Pacelle said, but will be in the next couple of days. iReport.com: Does Vick deserve a second chance? More attention has been paid to dogfighting as a result of Vick's case, Pacelle said.

"(CNN) -- Going into the eighth season finale of ""American Idol,"" Adam Lambert looks like the favorite against competitor Kris Allen. But should Lambert even be on the show, since he has performed professionally in the national Broadway tour of ""Wicked""? Former 'American Idol' runner-up Diana DeGarmo says it's getting harder for the average person to get on the show. Diana DeGarmo, runner-up in the third season of ""American Idol,"" spoke with HLN's Mike Galanos on Prime News about whether or not an amateur stands a chance on the show. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Mike Galanos: What were the stipulations as to your past history before you joined ""American Idol""? How much could you do before they'd say, ""You aren't an amateur anymore. You're more of a professional""? Diana DeGarmo: Each contract for each show has gotten a little stronger and a little stronger. Prior to me doing ""American Idol,"" I had done things like theater, but at that point nowhere near on a professional level. The cool thing is they keep it fair by having little things in the contract about how you can't release a record nationally with a record label -- things like that. But people who have been signed prior can, of course, be on the show. Galanos: Do you think the ""rags-to-riches"" story is lost and we are going to get more and more people who have more and more experience? DeGarmo: I think people now realize that ""American Idol"" is such a launching spot for anyone's career. People that maybe would have not done it a few years ago, saying, ""Oh, I'm too professional,"" maybe take a little bit of a second glance at the show because they realize it's such a launching pad. But I do think it's a little harder for the everyday Joe to get in it. Galanos: Do you think Adam has an unfair advantage since he was an understudy for the Broadway tour of ""Wicked""? DeGarmo: Not really, because it's all about performing. So it's just about what you are doing at that exact moment up there on the ""American Idol"" stage. I think Kris and Adam are just two totally different performers, but I think they are pretty even when it comes down to the end of the day.","DeGarmo: It's harder for the ""everyday Joe"" to get on ""American Idol""

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- Barack Obama marked his first Memorial Day as president on Monday, calling on Americans to remember U.S. troops who died in the service of their country and navigating a Civil War memorial controversy. President Obama pays tribute to veterans at a wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday. The president participated at the 141st annual Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery's Tomb of the Unknowns. The men and women buried at Arlington ""waged war so that we may know peace,"" Obama said. ""They were willing to give up everything for the defense of our freedom [and] were willing to sacrifice all for their country. ... They are the best of America."" Also Monday, Obama decided to continue a controversial presidential tradition of honoring Southern Civil War soldiers by sending a wreath to Arlington's Confederate Memorial, according to the White House. But the president decided to start what may become a new tradition by sending a wreath to the African-American Civil War Memorial at Vermont Avenue and U Street Northwest in Washington.  See how fallen service members are being remembered » . Critics had called for an end to the longtime presidential practice of laying a wreath at the Confederate site. Last week, roughly five dozen professors sent a letter to Obama calling the tradition offensive to African-Americans. Some observers recently suggested adding the recognition of the African-American memorial as a possible compromise. Wreaths also were sent to be placed on the mast of the USS Maine and the Spanish-American War Memorial, both in Arlington National Cemetery. Obama also hosted a White House breakfast for several military Gold Star families, the relatives of service men and women killed in action. A separate Memorial Day observance was held at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at 1 p.m. ET, and the National Memorial Day Parade started an hour later. All Americans were asked to pause for a moment of remembrance at 3 p.m. local time Monday ""because it is the time when most Americans are enjoying their freedoms on the national holiday,"" according to the White House Commission on Remembrance. ""The moment does not replace traditional Memorial Day events; rather it is an act of national unity in which all Americans, alone or with family and friends, honor those who died for our freedom,"" the commission said on its Web site. ""It will help to reclaim Memorial Day as the sacred and noble holiday it was meant to be. In this shared remembrance, we connect as Americans."" The 3 p.m. observances included, among other things, an interruption of Major League Baseball games and the pausing of the Washington Memorial Day Parade. The National Grocers Association and Food Marketing Institute has asked shoppers to pause in stores across the nation. Memorial Day was first marked May 30, 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War. Congress declared it a national holiday in 1971.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting Monday after world leaders reacted with outrage to North Korea's latest nuclear test. This screen grab from North Korean television on April 9 shows leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang. North Korea earlier said it had tested the weapon in an underground explosion, provoking an angry response from the world's governments. It had threatened to conduct the test if the U.N. Security Council did not apologize for imposing sanctions on North Korea after it tested a rocket April 5. The secretive communist state also apparently test-fired a short-range missile Monday, the White House said. The Security Council called on its members to discuss the reported test Monday at 4 p.m. ET.  Watch how the test may have taken world by surprise » . The United States and many other countries denounced the test. Even China, North Korea's strongest ally, said it opposed the test. The White House -- which less than three weeks ago announced a new diplomatic effort to restart stalled talks with North Korea about its nuclear program -- said the test was in ""blatant defiance"" of the Security Council. ""North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community,"" the White House said. ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international community."" While the test was not a surprise, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it showed Pyongyang was becoming ""increasingly belligerent."" North Korea announced its underground nuclear test a little more than an hour after the U.S. Geological Survey reported a magnitude 4.7 seismic disturbance at the site of North Korea's first nuclear test. There was no immediate information on the yield of the weapon used in Monday's test. The Russian Defense Ministry said the explosion was between 10 to 20 kilotons. The U.S. State Department said it was analyzing the data. Mullen said it would take a couple of days to verify the reported test, but he added, ""there's no indication that it wasn't as they say."" The North's state-run Korean Central News Agency would say only that the latest test was safely conducted ""on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control.""  Watch more analysis on test » . U.S. intelligence estimated the first North Korean test, in October 2006, produced an explosion equal to less than 1,000 tons of TNT. The low yield was a fraction of the size of the bombs the United States dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Intelligence analysts had predicted North Korea would conduct a second rocket or nuclear test. The North threatened to do so after the Security Council voted unanimously to condemn its April launch as a violation of a 2006 resolution that bans North Korea's ballistic missile activity.  Watch how Pyongyang has used nuclear tests to gain concessions » . North Korea insisted the rocket was a communications satellite. It retaliated by threatening to walk away from the six-party talks aimed at disarming the country of nuclear weapons. The talks -- involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States -- are intended to persuade North Korea to scrap its nuclear program. The North also expelled international inspectors from its nuclear sites, announced plans to restart the reactor that produces plutonium for its nuclear weapons, and threatened to launch more rockets and another nuclear device. Monday's test was conducted ""as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defense in every way,"" the North Korean news agency said. ""They think this will enhance and embolden their diplomatic capability to deal with the other countries,"" said Han Sung Joo, former South Korean ambassador to the United States. ""Of course, it may be working the other way. But from their point of view, this is their lifeline, which they want to maintain."" China's government ""expresses firm opposition"" to the test, in which North Korea ""disregarded the opposition of the international community,"" according to a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. North Korea's latest move could clear the way for the United States and the other members of the six-party talks, minus North Korea, to impose new punitive measures against a country desperate for food and energy assistance. For now, however, the North's nuclear arms program is not a major security threat, analysts say. The country has yet to build an effective bomb or develop an effective delivery system to a target country.  Watch South Korea's reaction to the nuclear test » . Last year, North Korea acknowledged producing roughly 88 pounds (40 kilograms) of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs. But analysts say North Korea is years from having a weapon it can put atop a long-range missile like those in the U.S., Chinese or Russian arsenals. ""I know a lot of people may think, 'Oh no, a nuclear test. Does that mean war, conflict in the Korean Peninsula?'"" said Jim Walsh, an international security analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""The answer is 'no.'""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Police trying to identify the badly decomposed body of a woman discovered in an industrial area in Chicago, Illinois, denied Saturday that a blue barrel was located near the remains. An ambulance and police cars stand by near the location where a woman's body was found in Chicago Friday. The original mention of a blue container in a statement from Lyons, Illinois, police sparked interest because of the possible tie to Stacy Peterson, 23, who disappeared October 28. Illinois State Police have named her husband, Drew Peterson, a suspect. They have investigated whether the former Bolingbrook, Illinois, police sergeant removed a blue plastic container from his home the night before his wife was reported missing. Drew Peterson, 53, has consistently said he believes she ran away with another man. Chicago Police spokeswoman Monique Bond said on Saturday that  no blue barrel was found near the body. An environmental surveyor from Lyons, Illinois, who was conducting tests at an industrial site in southwest Chicago found the remains Friday afternoon. Police said he called his supervisors to report he'd seen what appeared to be a human foot and leg. The body was transported to the Chicago medical examiner's office for autopsy. A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said the body appears to be that of a female with reddish-blond hair. A posting on findstacypeterson.com describes the missing woman's hair as brown. The body was found about 20 miles from the Petersons' home, where Drew Peterson said he last saw her, CNN's Susan Roesgen reported. Speaking to Nancy Grace on CNN Headline News, Drew Peterson's attorney, Joel Brodsky, said local authorities have already asked a state task force working on Stacy Peterson's disappearance not to get involved. ""I can tell you, it is not Stacy,"" Brodsky said. ""I can guarantee you that."" Brodsky offered no proof of his assertion. Drew and Stacy Peterson have been married four years and have two children.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British mother of a child who died after being brutally abused has been jailed indefinitely. A police computer image of some of the facial injuries suffered by baby Peter. The child's -- originally known as Baby P --horrifying death caused a furor in Britain, with the media, public and politicians united in demanding to know how his terrible injuries were missed by social workers, police and medical staff. Judge Stephen Kramer also Friday jailed the 27-year-old mum's boyfriend for life with a minimum of 12 years and their lodger, Jason Owen, 37, indefinitely but with a minimum of three years, the British Press Association reported. The boyfriend, 32, was also convicted of raping a two-year-old girl. Baby P's mum has to serve a minimum of five years. She and her boyfriend cannot be named. Baby P -- he could not be known by his first name, Peter, until the recent lifting of a court order -- was only 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot in August 2007. He had more than 50 injuries, including a broken back and fractured ribs, despite being on London's Haringey council's at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police over eight months. The resulting public outrage saw the government's child secretary, Ed Balls, step in to demand the removal of the council's head of children's services, Sharon Shoesmith, with two other leading officials also stepping down. Shoesmith had to be placed under police guard after death threats were made. Judge Kramer told Peter's mother that she was ""a manipulative and self-centered person, with a calculating side as well as a temper.""  Watch more on the case » . ""Your conduct over the months prevented Peter from being seen by social services. You actively deceived the authorities... you acted selfishly because your priority was your relationship,"" he told the court, PA reported. Judge Kramer's comments echoed the country's response to the case. ""Any decent person who heard the catalogue of medical conditions and non-accidental injuries suffered by Peter cannot fail to have been appalled."" A second serious review of the case commissioned by Balls and released Friday, also reiterated that Peter's death  ""could and should have been prevented."" Graham Badman, the chairman of Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board, which conducted the review said: ""I believe the most important lesson arising from this case is that professionals charged with ensuring child safety must be deeply skeptical of any explanations, justifications or excuses they may hear in connection with the apparent maltreatment of children. ""If they have any doubt about the cause of physical injuries or what appears to be maltreatment, they should act swiftly and decisively. Badman said the review found that if ""doctors, lawyers, police officers and social workers had adopted a more urgent, thorough and challenging approach, the case would have been stopped in its tracks at the first serious incident."" ""Baby Peter deserved better from the services that were supposed to protect him,"" Badman said.","British mother of child who died after brutal abuse has been jailed indefinitely .

People in Mexico City stream into the street as a magnitude 5.7 earthquake hits. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 5.7, and placed the epicenter near the city of Puebla, about 85 miles southeast of Mexico City. It hit at 2:24 p.m. local time.

"(CNN) -- Somalia needs international help to fight Islamist extremists battling for power in the lawless Horn of Africa nation, the country's moderate Islamist president said Monday. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was recently appointed Somalia's transitional president. ""I am calling on the international community to help Somalia defend against foreign militants who have invaded the country,"" President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said. Speaking at a news conference in Somalia's capital city, Mogadishu, Ahmed called several times for international help in fighting foreign militants whom he claims are the same fighters who have fought the ""international community"" in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Wherever they come, they fuel violence,"" the president said. ""The Somali people cannot and should not accept that their countries should be a launching pad for these militants to attack."" Ahmed told local journalists that he feared these foreign fighters would turn Somalia into another Iraq or Afghanistan, where U.S.-led forces are fighting Islamic extremist groups. He also praised local militias in the two regions of Hiiran and Middle Shabelle for struggling against the foreign militias. Last week, al-Shabab militants advanced to the presidential palace in Mogadishu, sparking sporadic fighting and shelling in the Somali capital. The recent fighting has killed more than 40 civilians and wounded about 150 others, according to sources at the scene. Al-Shabab -- once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union -- has been designated as a terrorist group by the United States, which says it is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network. Ahmed participated in seizing control of Mogadishu in 2006 along with the Islamic Courts Union before it was ousted by Ethiopian forces later that year. He has since split from Somali jihad movements and was recently appointed Somalia's transitional president through a process shepherded by the United Nations.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- More than one million people in Darfur are at risk of losing food, water and shelter in coming months, following the expulsion of international aid groups by Sudan's government, the United Nations' chief humanitarian coordinator said Tuesday. A Doctors without Borders medic helps a sick child in a Darfur refugee camp. The statement by coordinator John Holmes comes after a joint U.N.-Sudanese assessment of the situation. The information was gathered from March 11-18 in hopes of stemming further troubles in Darfur after Sudan's government expelled 13 international relief organizations from the wartorn region. The announcement came on the same day that President Omar al-Bashir, now an indicted war criminal, ignored the threat of arrest by traveling abroad to Eritrea. Also Tuesday, a Sudanese staffer working for a Canadian relief group was shot dead in Darfur. A full report of the assessment will be released soon, according to the U.N., but an executive summary and recommendations were made available on Tuesday. ""While a significant effort is being made by the government, by the U.N., by the NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] which are left, to plug some of the immediate gaps in these areas, these are at the same time, 'Band-Aid' solutions, not long term solutions,"" Holmes said. The U.N. estimates that 1.5 million people in Darfur are dependent on healthcare support, 1.1 million need regular food aid, and another 1 million are in need of clean drinking water. The summary released Tuesday said the World Food Programme, which is still allowed to operate in Sudan, is carrying out a one-time-only distribution program in March and April, but that new partners will be needed to continue delivering food after April. After the International Criminal Court charged Bashir with war crimes and crimes against humanity on March 4, Khartoum expelled 13 international aid agencies and revoked the permits of three organizations in the country. Bashir -- the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes by the court -- has continued to say that humanitarian efforts in the country should be ""Sudanized."" ""Within a year, we don't want to see any foreign aid group dealing with a Sudanese citizen,"" he said at a rally a week after his arrest warrant was issued. Holmes said that 13,000 to 14,000 aid workers in the region already were Sudanese nationals. Holmes said the cooperation and technical help from the Sudanese government on the assessment was a good step forward. But he called it ""only the first of many steps if the people in Darfur are not going to suffer major consequences from these expulsions."" Sudan's U.N. Ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad, has repeatedly said he has information implicating the ousted organizations in activities contrary to their humanitarian missions. He has yet to make any of that information public. One claim is that some organizations acted as spies for the International Criminal Court. Holmes denied those allegations, saying they remain unfounded. ""Despite claims that there are dossiers of evidence, we have not been given any of that evidence,"" he said. ""In the absence of that, no meaningful investigation can be done."" The British aid organization, Oxfam, one of the agencies expelled from Sudan, released a statement in response to Tuesday's findings. ""Current stop-gap measures will only be effective for a short time,"" the statement said. ""As the rainy season arrives within the next two months, people living in weak temporary shelters, in flood-prone locations where latrines can fill and overflow, will become at extreme risk of disease and death. ""With the humanitarian capacity reduced by nearly 50 percent, responding to such emergency scenarios will be an enormous challenge for others to tackle,"" Oxfam said.","Assessment of humanitarian needs in Darfur conducted by UN and Sudan .

Such bargains may not be haute couture, but during a recession they are a thrifty shopper's dream. As budgets tighten during the economic crunch, buying used clothing is no longer just for fans of vintage wear.

That's a message that Brendan Hurley, senior vice president of Marketing and Communications for Goodwill of Greater Washington, has been working hard to get out. Goodwill of Greater Washington provided the fashions Honeycutt modeled for the show at the Arlington United Methodist Church in Arlington, Virginia, and has been actively campaigning to spread the word that Goodwill fashion is contemporary and hot. ""Most people have a misunderstanding of Goodwill's mission and they believe that our mission is to sell inexpensive merchandise to the poor,"" Hurley said. ""In fact, Goodwill's mission is to provide job training and employment services to people with disadvantages and disabilities. We just happen to fund that mission through the resale of donated items at our retail stores."" To change the negative perception, Hurley said that four years ago they started a campaign to make the stores more appealing as a source of inexpensive fashions by holding virtual and live fashion shows.

About once a month on average, Hall and her team put together ""travel and trunk shows"" where they pull merchandise from their nine stores, put them on rolling racks and take them to events for attendees to shop.

""The response has been tremendous,"" Hall said. ""We know that finding that treasure at Goodwill, finding that vintage piece, really resonates with people."" Across the country, Goodwill stores have launched several creative ideas to attract divas (or divos) who may have more style than funds. Goodwill Industries of Michiana Inc. of South Bend, Indiana, has ""Boutique Days,"" where they work with local fashion reporter and consultant Kathy Friend to raise awareness that Goodwill can be an excellent resource for brand name and designer clothing. Those who donate at least 20 clothing items receive an opportunity for a private consultation with Friend at a reduced rate. ""On a trip to Goodwill I've found Chanel handbags still in the tissue paper and in Saks Fifth Avenue bags,"" said Friend, who as part of her consultation teaches clients everything from how to spot signs of wear to how they can get pieces altered. ""I was like, are you kidding me?""  See examples of fashionable outfits from Goodwill » . The Goodwill/Easter Seals program in Minnesota held a ""Second Runway"" fashion show in February where 30 volunteer fashion designers took existing clothes from surrounding Goodwill stores and turned them into hip new outfits. The event attracted more than 500 attendees. ""We were given $50 and we could create up to three looks out of things we found at the Goodwill,"" said designer Kristina Bell, who whipped up a cute little dress out of recycled T-shirts. ""I've always been a thrifter, but now it's a really good way to save money."" Someone else's hard times can be a fashionista's gain. Denise McShane owns McShane's Exchange, whose two locations in the Chicago, Illinois, neighborhood of Lincoln Park have seen an uptick in those unloading their Prada and St. John. ""Business has really boomed,"" McShane said. ""The bad news is that we are in a recession, but I absolutely have had a surge in consigners."" McShane said she offers those who still have a cash stash a bit of retail therapy during hard times. They can get great buys at a reduced rate. Such shops, known in the industry as resale stores, have long attracted quality merchandise, said Barbara Nell, owner of The Daisy Shop on Oak in Chicago. Nell said women are bringing in only the best for resale. ""Women seem to be cleaning their closets of their most luxurious items,"" said Nell. ""It's not just the bread and butter or staples of their wardrobe anymore."" iReporter Elizabeth McElherne scored a $25 mink coat in August at a shop in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Check out Elizabeth's iReport on her find . ""If you can't buy something new, you might as well recycle and buy someone else's stuff,"" McElherne said.

Mladic said she encourages her readers to not only shop thrift, but also to be generous in their giving. ""I make sure to thin out my wardrobe every so often,"" she said. ""Any pieces that I am not wearing, I donate."" That type of generosity is much appreciated, especially in the current economy. Melissa Temme, a national spokeswoman for the Salvation Army, said that while the need for low-cost clothing is increasing, donations for such clothing have remained consistent and that could spell trouble. ""It means that down the road we may not be able to stock our shelves,"" Temme said. ""In the long term, that's a concern."" Katherine Ransom, communications manager for Goodwill of Orange County, California, said that as more people turn to thrift fashions to help stretch their dollars, they are discovering the clothing is a lot more current than they might have imagined. Ransom said even Hollywood types are getting in on the act, as wardrobe consultants for television shows and movies are also perusing the racks for good buys. A recently launched coupon campaign is bringing in even more shoppers, she said. ""People are saying 'I've never done this before, but now is a good time to start,' "" said Ransom, whose organization launched shopgoodwill.com 10 years ago. It now includes merchandise from 77 Goodwill organizations around the country.

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama is a married man but there's another woman with a hold on him that his wife can never match: she runs the House. Nancy Pelosi has been an easy target for Republican ire. She is Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, the most powerful woman in Washington and lately, a target for Republicans. Pelosi is easy to spot in any crowd of U.S. politicians; she's the small brown-haired woman in the smartly tailored suit. Conservatives like to stereotype some Democrats as rich, isolated and out-of-touch. As the wife of an affluent investment banker, the always expertly coiffed Pelosi looks like exactly the kind of ""Limousine Liberal"" they're talking about. Ironically, it's money that makes her powerful. Under the U.S. constitution, the president can't spend a penny without the permission of Congress. Within the Congress, the Senate has its own powers but the House is the place where taxes and spending start. So almost every one of Obama's plans needs a push from Pelosi. Maybe that's part of the reason she's in trouble right now. The issue isn't really part of her daily duties: ""waterboarding"" and other extreme interrogation tactics used against prisoners in the Bush era. Obama ordered an end to the harsh methods, but Republicans are asking why Democrats who knew about them years ago didn't try to stop them then. Pelosi was one of a handful of lawmakers who was briefed by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002, but she now accuses the agency of lying to her and hiding what it was doing. Republicans have been attacking Pelosi for making unsubstantiated and damaging accusations against a crucial national security agency. The man who once had her job, former Republican speaker Newt Gingrich, says Pelosi is lying in a way that is ""despicable, dishonest and vicious."" Whether or not he's right, it's smart politics. Obama is still remarkably popular. Most of the country hopes that he'll succeed in rebuilding the economy and ending the war in Iraq. If the president is immune to most easy attacks from the opposition, it needs to find someone who isn't. Pelosi is a crucial part of his plans. As potential targets go, with her nearly perfect hair and nearly perfect clothes, Pelosi is nearly perfect.","Nancy Pelosi, speaker in House, is most powerful woman in Washington .

"(CNN) -- It's a Tuesday morning and Dr. Eric DeJonge is headed to work. But unlike most physicians, DeJonge's office is his car and his patients are waiting for him in their homes, not in a large waiting room. As part of the Medical House Call Program,  Dr. Eric DeJonge visits one of his group's 600 patients. DeJonge, a geriatric specialist at Washington Hospital Center, runs the hospital's ""Medical House Call Program."" Sharing duties with program co-founder Dr. George Taler and two other doctors, DeJonge criss-crosses the nation's capital, checking on patients in their homes. Armed with a black bag and blackberry, DeJonge visits mostly the elderly who either can't get to a hospital or are so ill that moving them would prove life-threatening. He usually sees them once a month to check on their status, to make sure their medications are working, and to let them know he's there for them. DeJonge says the one-on-one care is invaluable. ""We know the patients, their families,"" he says. ""We know when they change medically, what has to happen to prevent them from making an ER visit."" Terry Carter's father, Aubrey, has been homebound since he suffered a stroke over 20 years ago. For most of those years, Carter ran back and forth to doctors' offices and the ER, making sure his father got the best medical help. It got to be expensive and time consuming and, as the years progressed, it became increasingly difficult to care for his dad. Carter says it was tough because ""I really don't have very much help to take him out."" Now, with DeJonge making regular visits, Carter's father doesn't have to be moved from his home and his health has improved. ""He's only been in the hospital twice in the last three years,"" says Carter. ""Before that he was in the hospital every other month.""  Dr. Gupta: Watch more on the return of the house call » . House calls, once popular in the 1930s, began to drop off as medical technology improved. According to a recent article in the Clinics of Geriatric Medicine, home visits by doctors dropped from 40 percent of physician encounters in 1930 to 10 percent by 1950; by 1980 home visits represented less than 1 percent of physician encounters. Many patients, the article stated, felt they could get better care at hospitals and clinics, and shied away from having a doctor come to their home. And over the years, billing and paperwork for medical professionals became so overwhelming that many spent hours at their desks with calculators instead of spending time with their patients in their homes. And then, there was the financial disincentive: most insurance companies didn't pay for house calls. It was easier and more lucrative for doctors to see more patients in their office than fewer patients in their homes. Reimbursement was spotty and in order to survive doctors had to put house calls on the back burner. But that has begun to change. Ten years ago, Medicare made it a bit easier for physicians to receive payments for house calls by modifying the way doctors bill for their procedures. And this month, a new ""Independence at Home"" bill -- designed to coordinate benefits for Medicare's most expensive beneficiaries, like Aubrey Carter -- will be reintroduced, making it easier and less expensive to carry out house calls. ""Our current health care system does a poor job caring for seriously ill Americans, who often are 'lost in transition,'"" says Massachusetts Congressman Edward Markey, author of the bill. ""This bipartisan, bicameral bill holds great promise for improving quality of care, reducing hospitalizations, lowering costs and lifting the spirits of those who, after a lifetime of contributions to our society, deserve the dignity and peace of mind that comes with living independently."" From the doctors' perspective, DeJonge says it will make all the difference in how he and his partners practice, and everyone would benefit. ""Those savings would be shared with the health systems that are willing to create them and serve their communities . For now, DeJonge, along with his fellow physicians and staff (three nurse practitioners, three social workers, one office nurse and four support staffers), will continue to provide care for 600 patients in the neighborhoods of Washington. With the help of machines such a portable EKGs, compact ultrasounds and X-ray programs for laptops, they can provide even more extensive care to patients in their own homes than their 1930s counterparts. DeJonge says it's stressful but rewarding. ""They feel like the medical community is part of their family,"" he says. ""There is a trust level that they develop when you know them over that long period of time. That's very important.""","In 1930s, 40 percent of physician encounters were house calls; 1 percent by 1980 .

"(CNN) -- Eighteen-year-old Juan Gonzalez was dying alone in a hospital, thousand of miles from his Guatemalan home. He was separated from the family he had traveled to the United States to help support. Juan Gonzalez was earning $250 a week as a dishwasher when his heart trouble began. Diagnosed with a chronically weak heart, without much money and lacking resources, Gonzalez seemed bound to die without ever seeing his parents again. That changed after CNN aired a story about his plight. Thanks to the help of a compassionate hospital staff, a U.S. congressman and a concerned community, Gonzalez has been reunited with his parents for what may be the last time.  Watch Gonzalez make his tearful plea » . Like many undocumented workers, Gonzalez came to the United States last fall to provide some financial help for his family, who had fallen on hard times back in Guatemala. He took a job as a dishwasher in Rome, Georgia, making about $250 a week. Then, in November, his heart gave out. Gonzalez has been in and out of the hospital for seven months. Doctors diagnosed Gonzalez with dilated cardiomyopathy, which means his heart muscle is very weak. Dr. Frank Stegall, Gonzalez's cardiologist, said the Guatemalan teen's heart pumps only 20 percent of the blood a healthy heart should. But as Gonzalez's heart failed him, he opened up the hearts of others. Stegall and the staff at Rome's Redmond Regional Medical Center were inspired by Gonzalez's attitude and courage and set out to reunite the dying teen with his parents. They contacted U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Georgia. Gingrey got the State Department involved in expediting visas for Pascual and Maria Gonzalez, Juan's parents. Delta Air Lines donated tickets to Atlanta, and the Gonzalezes boarded a plane for the first time, bound for Georgia to see their dying son.  Watch the family reunion » . Gonzalez has vowed to fight to the end, but doctors say his prognosis isn't good. With no money, Stegall says, it will be tough for the teen to get a heart transplant. Now, after traveling thousands of miles for more than two weeks to make a better life for his family and himself, Gonzalez faces his final fight, but it's one he will face with his family, thanks to the kindness of others.","Undocumented immigrant went to Georgia to make money for family .

"Fareed Zakaria is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on CNN at 1 and 5 p.m. ET Sundays. Zakaria says India's elections could mark its debut as a great power. (CNN) -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took the oath of office Friday for a second consecutive term after winning a mandate for his Congress party. President Pratibha Devisingh Patil administered the oath to Singh, seen as the architect of India's economic reforms in the 1990s. Nineteen other lawmakers also were sworn in as members of the new federal Cabinet. The Indian National Congress, headed by Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, won 206 of 543 boroughs in the April and May general elections. That is the party's best performance in almost two decades that saw mostly coalition governments running the country. CNN spoke to author and foreign affairs analyst Fareed Zakaria about the results. CNN: What do you think of the outcome of the Indian elections? Fareed Zakaria: These elections I think may be looked upon as India's debut as a great power -- the way the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics heralded China's debut. They are also the perfect symbol, in this case, of India's unique strengths -- which are defined not by government power but people power with all the messiness and chaos that implies. With 420 million people voting, India's recent polling was the biggest exercise of democracy ever. CNN: But the exercise of democracy in India isn't new. What makes this one special? Zakaria: You are right. It was the result of these elections. Over the last two decades, India has been consumed with its internal divisions -- of caste, ethnicity and religion. This has made if difficult for a government in New Delhi to mobilize national power to any purposeful and responsible end internationally. A decentralized, divided, and diffuse polity has punched well below its weight internationally or adopted policies abroad for purely domestic reasons. That's bad for India and bad for the world. This could all change, starting with this election result. For the first time in three decades, a single party -- the Indian National Congress -- was given a clear and large mandate. CNN: Why were there so many problems in the past? Zakaria: It was mainly two issues. First, populism trumps economic reform. Promising the voters goodies works better than imposing budgetary discipline. Two, in the age of terrorism, fear was an easy way to mobilize political support. (These problems have affected democracies in rich countries like America just as much as poor ones.) The Indian results contradict both notions. The Congress Party has been reasonably reform-mined economically and highly responsible on issues of terrorism. It chose not to react violently to the recent Mumbai terror attacks and was vilified as weak by the opposition. The voters didn't buy it. CNN: Can you think of why things have changed for the voters? Zakaria: I can't be certain but I will put some of the credit for providing a new option to voters on the shoulder of Rahul Gandhi. He is the 39-year-old son of the former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, and the current head of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi. He spent the last few years reviving the grassroots base of the Congress party. He also made a series of big strategic bets during the campaign such as to field young candidates, not to ally with caste-based parties which proved to be right. He, along with his mother and the current Prime Minister Singh, are reviving the Congress party, and have done all this while maintaining a commitment to secularism, economic reform and clean government . CNN: So the voters in India got it right? Zakaria: I think so. But I also do want to take a minute to impress on readers the scope of elections in India. It really is amazing to see the largest democracy at work. First of all, look at the scope. 420 million people voted. That's more than all the people (men, women and children) who live in the United States, Britain and Canada combined. Then the process -- there are five election days over the course of a month; votes are cast in almost 1 million polling places. It is by far the biggest exercise in democracy in the history of the world. But all of that is only part of what makes it really remarkable. The Indian electorate is one of the poorest, least educated in the world but they actively participate in the political process. And they voted in a very intelligent way. Something they should be very proud of.","Zakaria: Election shows India's unique strength, people power .

"(CNN) -- Five people were killed when their boat struck a barge in southern Louisiana, the Terrebonne Parish sheriff said Thursday. The accident occurred Wednesday night in the Falgout Canal in Dularge, Louisiana, Sheriff Vernon Bourgeois said. The bodies were not discovered until Thursday morning, when people began arriving on the barge for work and saw the boat and one body, Bourgeois said. The barge is being used to repair damage to the canal from past hurricanes. The victims' damaged boat was partially submerged under the barge, he said. The barge was slightly damaged, he said. The victims were last seen about 10 p.m. Wednesday leaving the Dulac, Louisiana-area en route to Bayou Dularge, the sheriff's office said. The victims were identified as: Michael J. Carrere, 43, of the Bayou Blue area, Louisiana; Carey Meche, 52, of Metairie, Louisiana; Lawrence Flak, 54, of Conroe, Texas; Rene Gauthier, 59, of Houston, Texas; and William Voss, 49, of Katy, Texas. They were entered in a fishing tournament that begins Friday, the sheriff said. Additional details were not immediately available.

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Shell-shocked and scarred both inside and out, they huddle in tents, water and medicine in short supply -- hundreds of thousands of people, civilian victims of Sri Lanka's recently-ended civil war. Displaced Sri Lankan people look out from inside a camp in Cheddikulam. ""We suffered a lot because shelling was coming from everywhere,"" said a 38-year-old man identifying himself as Vishwamala. ""Firing, shelling -- many, many people have died ... there was nobody there to carry the dead. A lot of dead were left on the road."" Another survivor, Krisha Duray, recalls ""running and running"" to escape shelling by both the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tiger rebels, who waged a bloody 25-year war. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday visited refugee camps housing such victims. ""I have traveled around the world and visited similar places, but this is by far the most appalling scenes I have seen,"" he said. Ban requested that the United Nations be provided full access to the displacement camps in order to provide aid. In a joint statement issued Saturday, Ban and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the United Nations will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced persons, and that the government will continue to provide access to humanitarian agencies. That access, however, is limited. The United Nations and other organizations have never had full access, as government officials fear some remaining Tamil Tiger rebels may be hiding in the camps and are screening those inside.  Watch the U.N. chief discuss the humanitarian crisis » . Sri Lanka's Sunday Times newspaper reported that attempts to smuggle youths out of the camps has prompted the government to impose restrictions on visits. Rajiva Wijesinha, the nation's human rights ministry secretary, was quoted as telling the newspaper that people ""with the connivance of Non-Governmental Organization workers"" were involved in the plot. Because of the plot, ""a thorough screening of IDPs was under way,"" the newspaper said. ""I have United Nations humanitarian agencies, and there are ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) and many other international humanitarian agency workers,"" Ban said in a Saturday news conference, according to a transcript. ""They should be given unimpeded access and freedom of movement within the camp. That is what I have asked the foreign minister and the president (for), and I was assured that the leaders of the Sri Lankan government will make sure (of this)."" Sri Lanka's government as of Sunday had not responded to Ban's appeal. But the joint statement Saturday said, ""The government will expedite the necessary basic and civil infrastructure as well as (the) means of livelihood necessary for the IDPs to resume their normal lives at the earliest. ""The Secretary-General welcomed the announcement by the government expressing its intention to dismantle the welfare villages at the earliest as outlined in the plan to resettle the bulk of IDPs and call for its early implementation."" Ban toured Manik Farm, a sprawling camp for internally displaced people in the country's north, days after Sri Lanka declared victory in a 25-year civil war against the Tamil Tigers rebels. About 250,000 to 300,000 people are refugees in the country, according to humanitarian groups and U.N. figures. Some in the camp have experienced fierce fighting in recent months, saying that at moments they did not believe they were going to survive. Asked whether he agrees with the military's assertions that not many civilians died in the violence, Ban told CNN he believes there were many civilian casualties. While the war's end elicited celebrations in parts of the country, humanitarian groups and the United Nations worry about those uprooted by the fighting. Ban arrived in the South Asian island nation Friday, saying he came to offer help and partnership. ""I hope my visit today can help begin a process of national recovery, renewal and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans,"" Ban said in a written statement issued Friday. ""That is why I am here."" He said he would urge the government to expedite the screening and processing of refugees and ensure that displaced camps have adequate supplies of food, medicine and water. With the war's end, ""the government of Sri Lanka faces many immediate and long-term challenges relating to issues of relief, rehabilitation, resettlement and reconciliation,"" the joint statement said. Ban also flew to the site of the civil war's final battle, near Mullaitivu.

"(CNN) -- ""Jurymen seldom convict a person they like, or acquit one that they dislike."" -- Clarence Darrow . A moussed, tousled brown hairstyle is murder trial defendant Phil Spector's latest look. Since April, the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector has been playing out in Los Angeles, California, oddly contrasting gruesome CSI details with the defendant's daily fashion emergency. Jurors finally will go behind closed doors for deliberations at the end of the week. Their impressions of Spector's over-the-top fashion statements and  nebbish-like demeanor could weigh as heavily, legal analysts say, as any of the conflicting expert testimony about ballistics, blood spatter and other forensic evidence. Spector, a diminutive aging hipster who invented the ""Wall of Sound"" and worked with the Beatles and Ike and Tina Turner, is accused of second-degree murder. He allegedly shot Lana Clarkson, a B-movie actress-turned-House of Blues hostess whose film credits include ""Barbarian Queen"" and ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" As the sun began to rise on February 3, 2003, police found her body slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's 8,500-square-foot Pyrenees-style castle, a Colt Cobra Special .38-caliber revolver at her feet. The question the jury must answer is straightforward: Did Spector, 67, shoot Clarkson, 40, in the face after she spurned his romantic advances and tried to leave his home? Or did she shoot herself, either by accident or in suicidal despair over her flagging Hollywood career? The jurors didn't hear directly from Spector. The most damaging testimony came from his Brazilian-born driver, who said the boss wandered out of the castle that morning and announced, ""I think I killed somebody."" His dress and mannerisms at the defense table were impossible to ignore. ""Sometimes the most important thing about a defendant's court appearance is the defendant's appearance,"" Court TV anchor Lisa Bloom said. ""Looks count when it comes to a criminal trial,"" agreed Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ""They can work for a defendant, and they can work against a defendant."" Levenson, who observes and analyzes high-profile trials, has written a scholarly article on the subject. She cites studies that show jurors are influenced by how attractive -- or unattractive -- a defendant is. Such impressions are not formally recognized as evidence in most courts, and jurors are rarely instructed on how to weigh them, she found. Levenson concludes that jurors inevitably take cues from a defendant's courtroom demeanor, whether judges want them to or not. Demeanor makes the biggest impact when a defendant doesn't take the stand. ""We need to be realistic as to how we deal with the theater of the courtroom,"" Levenson concludes. ""Demeanor evidence of non-testifying parties is the new frontier."" She suggests adding a jury instruction to weigh a defendant's demeanor like any other character evidence. It could prove to be a controversial idea. Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst, is comfortable with the current standard. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" he said. ""Jurors can't help but look at a defendant. But turning it into a formal part of trial would be a mistake."" Levenson agreed to share an advance copy of her richly footnoted paper, which will be published in January's  Minnesota Law Journal. She cites several well-known cases in which jurors later said their impressions of the defendant influenced their verdicts: . Attorneys long ago learned how to manipulate nonverbal cues to communicate with juries. ""Smart lawyers use it to their advantage,"" said Mark Geragos, a frequent guest on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" The prominent Los Angeles criminal defense attorney has given makeovers to several of his clients, including Whitewater figure Susan McDougal, who favored white pantsuits in court and won acquittals at two trials. Spector's courtroom appearance seems to be a misfire, said Geragos, who doesn't believe the defense team is making the fashion calls.  Geragos says a defendant can ""make or break himself"" » . At Spector's trial, jurors have heard about his history of threatening women with guns, although one witness left an impression more comic than fearsome when she offered this description of the gun-toting defendant: . ""He looked like Elmer Fudd. The gun was bigger than he was,"" said Kathy Sullivan, recalling an incident she alleges took place in 1997 or 1998. By contrast, the jurors' view of Clarkson has only two dimensions. In the agency photos she used to look for acting jobs, she is a striking, tanned California blonde with windswept hair and a broad smile of white, perfectly even teeth. In heels, she stood about 6 feet tall, according to testimony, while Spector is 5 feet, 4 inches tall. Jurors also have been barraged by gruesome crime scene photos of Clarkson. Her mouth is a pulpy crimson chasm. The revolver lies at her feet, which turn outward in platform Mary Janes. Jurors heard during the prosecutor's case how the bullet severed her spinal cord and shattered her teeth, spraying bloody saliva in a two- to six-foot arc, about how her dying gasps may have sprayed onto Spector's white jacket. Levenson has been advising the judge on legal issues during the Spector trial, so she declined to comment on the specifics of his case. But the consensus among the experienced trial analysts who spoke with CNN is that Spector has not done himself any favors. Spector has sported three hairstyles in three different shades, a color wheel of pastel ties and pocket handkerchiefs topped at times by foppish, flowing morning coats. He has worn an orange tie with a pink shirt, and a black shirt unbuttoned in a fashion better suited for an airport lounge. He wears platform shoes. Trial bloggers and observers gossip about whether he is wearing a wig or lipstick. ""He's definitely a nutty guy,"" observed Toobin. ""He's certainly not a very likable looking guy."" ""Somewhere between Charles Manson and Marilyn Manson,"" quipped Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. attorney in Miami who regularly comments on legal matters for CNN. ""As a prosecutor you're saying, 'Bring it on. We like blond. We like goofy clothes. We like a guy who looks like he's as phony as a $3 bill.' ""  Coffey says Spector looks ""completely untrustworthy"" » . ""Fairly unhinged"" was the impression offered by Geragos, who described Spector's courtroom look as ""perplexing."" The usually ebullient lawyer was uncharacteristically subdued in his comments: ""It is not an engaging look. It is not repulsive. I don't think this would be your ideal situation from a defense standpoint."" Court TV's Lisa Bloom believes Spector is trying to communicate to jurors that he's ""an eccentric rock star"" who doesn't place much stock in what's happening in the courtroom. ""I think the pimp suits are his way for showing disrespect for the process."" Bloom said Spector is sending a message: ""It's all about me, me, me. I'm the celebrity. It's all about me."" She doubts it will be effective. ""His clothes are so out there,"" Bloom said. ""His looks are so out there. Will it backfire? I don't know. You have to take into account this is L.A.""

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Like many Nepalese guides, Apa Sherpa started trekking to the top of Mount Everest in the shadow of more famous climbers -- including the son of the late Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to climb to the top of the world's tallest peak. Apa Sherpa has climbed Mount Everest more times than any other person. But the 49-year-old Nepali -- who now lives in the United States -- on Thursday morning became the only person in the world to summit Everest 19 times. Apa says his goals in climbing the 29,029-foot (8,848-meter) mountain have nothing to do with setting the world record for Everest summits, a title he has held since 1998. ""Up to the 17th time in 2007 I climbed as a professional, as part of my occupation,"" Apa said, according to the Web site tracking the progress of his most recent expedition. ""But last year I climbed to raise funds for a school in Thame, my village on the foot of Everest."" In addition to raising money for Nepali schoolkids, Apa also plans to remove more than two tons of garbage from Everest. Over the past 55 years, some 2,000 mountaineers have climbed the peak, leaving behind a trail of trash that includes oxygen bottles, food cans, gas cylinders, paper, plastic and even tents. Everest -- known by Nepalis as Sagarmatha -- is considered sacred by the Nepalese people, and is worshipped as a goddess of wealth and power by the Sherpas, the inhabitants of the Everest region. Apa comes from the famed Sherpa community of mountain guides, who work as porters and climbing guides for mountaineers from all over the world. While Everest is not considered the most technically challenging climb by experienced mountaineers, the world's highest peak attracts an array of climbers who spend tens of thousands of dollars for the chance to make it to the top. However, the mountain is deadly for many climbers: More than 200 people have died trying to scale Everest. Apa began working as an expedition porter for Everest climbers to earn money after his father died when he was 12 years old, according to his biography on his team's Web site, SuperSherpas.com. Many of the mountaineers noticed the young Sherpa who, despite his small size, was able to carry large loads ""with strength, quickness and a wide smile,"" according to his biography. But it wasn't until he was about 30 years old that Apa began climbing Everest as a guide. He made it to the top in 1990 with a team that included Peter Hillary, whose father first summited the peak along Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953. That team also included Rob Hall, a New Zealander who lost his life on the mountain in 1996, the deadliest season for climbers in Everest's history. Eight climbers, including Hall, died trying to summit the peak on May 11, 1996, known as the ""Everest disaster."" The incident highlighted the pressure that mountaineering companies face when their clients -- who have paid as much as $60,000 -- want to make it to the top despite foreboding weather and their lack of experience. Hall had asked Apa several times during the 1996 season to work for him, but Apa refused in order to be with his family, according to Everestnews.com. Apa reached Everest's peak for the 19th time at 8 a.m. local time on Thursday, announcing over a crackling radio, ""I am at the top and looking at all the prayer flags,"" according to the Web site tracking his progress. ""I have just satisfied the deities and placed the Bhumpa on the summit."" He was referring to an 8-inch-tall copper vase which is considered sacred and contains 400 elements, including precious metals, Buddhist relics, shreds of robes worn by venerated monks, holy water, and soil. Last month, Apa said that putting the vase on the mountain would be a prayer for world peace and prosperity. After spending 30 minutes at the top, he headed down. ""It is so cold here ... I am heading down."" Crowds of climbers forced Apa to delay his ascent to the summit by an hour. May is considered the ideal time to try to reach the top of Everest, and Nepali tourism authorities said 98 people had climbed the mountain on Tuesday and Wednesday from the south side. Apa currently lives near Salt Lake City, Utah, where he works as a climbing instructor and gives lectures. He has three children -- two sons, ages 23 and 18, and a 14-year-old daughter. He has said he does not want his children to follow in his footsteps as a climber. His SuperSherpas team has raised $30,000 to educate the children of Nepal, and Apa hopes that his climbing successes will continue to raise more money for the impoverished Himalayan country. ""I never had a plan to make a record,"" Apa told The Salt Lake Tribune last month before leaving for Nepal. ""I never had that as a dream. It just keeps happening."" CNN's Manesh Shrestha contributed to this report.","Apa Sherpa, 49, of Nepal, successfully climbs Mount Everest for the 19th time .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The family history of poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath took another tragic turn Monday when it was revealed that their son had committed suicide after battling depression. Poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath had separated before their son's first birthday. Nicholas Hughes, whose mother asphyxiated herself in 1963 by putting her head in a gas oven at her London home while her two children slept in the next room, hanged himself at his home in Alaska, his sister Frieda told The Times newspaper. Hughes, 47, was unmarried with no children of his own and had until recently been a marine biologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The Times said that shortly before his death he had left his academic job to set up a pottery workshop at home. Frieda Hughes, a poet, author and artist, said in a statement to the newspaper: ""It is with profound sorrow that I must announce the death of my brother, Nicholas Hughes, who died by his own hand on Monday March 16, 2009 at his home in Alaska. ""He had been battling depression for some time."" She added: ""His lifelong fascination with fish and fishing was a strong and shared bond with our father (many of whose poems were about the natural world). ""He was a loving brother, a loyal friend to those who knew him and, despite the vagaries that life threw at him, he maintained an almost childlike innocence and enthusiasm for the next project or plan."" Hughes was only a baby when his mother killed herself, and his father tried to shield his children from the intense public interest in the family. Some feminist groups blamed the death on Ted Hughes, who had left Plath for Assia Wevill, the wife of another poet. Six years later, Wevill gassed herself and their daughter Shura in an apparent copycat suicide. Ted Hughes died in 1998, the year he published Birthday Letters, a series of poems about his life with Plath and her death. Hughes appears in both of his parents' poetry. In ""Nick and the Candlestick,"" published in Plath's posthumous collection ""Ariel,"" she wrote: ""You are the one. Solid the spaces lean on, envious. You are the baby in the barn."" Later his father wrote of how, after Plath's death, their son's eyes ""became wet jewels, the hardest substance of the purest pain. As I fed him in his high white chair."" Frieda Hughes has written about her parents and her own battles with depression but a family friend dismissed the idea that Nicolas's death fitted into a family trend. ""Nick wasn't just the baby son of Plath and Hughes and it would be wrong to think of him as some kind of inevitably tragic figure,"" said the unnamed friend. ""He was a man who reached his mid-forties, an adventurous marine biologist with a distinguished academic career behind him and a host of friends and achievements in his own right. That is the man who is mourned by those who knew him.""","Son of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath commits suicide, his sister says .

"GREENVILLE, Ohio (CNN) -- The parishioners heard the sirens during Sunday morning services in Greenville, Ohio. A few blocks from St. Paul's Lutheran Church, a home was burning and five people were dead. Police tape wards off the curious from the duplex where a woman and four children died in a fire September 16. Shock followed sadness with news that a 10-year-old boy was being charged with arson and murder, more heartbreak for a town in tough times -- but heartbreak that shook people into action. The St. Paul's parishioners reacted quickly that  morning, said Shirley DiRocco, a volunteer at the church. Just passing the collection plate once around the church, she said, ""We came up with $300."" The money went to buy clothes for the fire's survivors and food for the emergency crew who responded, she said. Helping out is nothing new for the church -- but a boy  being accused of killing his mother, half-sister and three other children in a fire has been unheard of till now. There's a lot of introspection going on in Greenville, a small town of 13,000 where the good-paying jobs are getting scarce and the problems of big-city poverty are creeping in. Residents are divided on whether the boy is responsible, but they say his plight compels them to look at themselves and face their deepening problems. ""He's a young kid. There's something got to be wrong for him to come up with that,"" said Angie Hughes, manager of a downtown Greenville hair salon. ""It has brought to the surface the fact that in this area ... we do have a lot of folks who are the have-nots in the world ... the vast numbers of people in our community who are really deep in poverty,"" said Peter B. Menke, pastor of St. Paul's.  Watch Menke talk about how the tragedy has galvanized Greenville » . St. Paul's sees firsthand the poverty that led to the boy having to sleep on the sofa, because he had no bed in the half of the duplex he shared with nine other people. Christy Winans managed to escape the fire with her boyfriend, but her three children -- Kayla Winans, 6; Je'Shawn Davis, 5; and Jasmine Davis, 3 -- died along with their playmate Kaysha Palmer, 8, who was the boy's half-sister. The boy's mother, Chanan Palmer, was also killed. On Monday, as the 10-year-old appeared in court on murder charges, St. Paul's expanded its lunchtime soup kitchen service to run two days a week. Twenty-two people turned up for the meal that first day. The church had fed 70 people, including parents and children, one day this summer. Menke said the tragedy of September 16 ""has galvanized ... particularly the religious community to action. We not just saying 'Yes, we have a problem,' but we are looking at ways to genuinely address those issues and do something about it."" Federal statistics show unemployment is hurting Greenville and surrounding Darke County. Employment in private businesses fell by 7 percent from 2000 to 2005. Manufacturing companies left town and big employers downsized, like Fram oil filter maker, or closed down completely, like Corning's fiber-optics plant. Alicia Sommer, who's lived in Greenville for 37 years and taught in the local schools, says job losses have changed the town. ""On the surface it looks like the ideal hometown,"" she said. ""Everyone wants to raise their kids here, but they can't afford it. They have to go where the jobs are,"" she says, leaning on the counter of the downtown coffee shop where she works part time. Walking through the five blocks of downtown Greenville, you see why it looks ideal. Mom-and-pop coffee shops stand in for Starbucks, locals chat on a bench outside a music store, a small cinema offers ""Mr. Bean's Holiday"" and an Asian monster flick about battling dragons. But St. Paul's offers the soup kitchen only a block off the Broadway main drag, and the tumbledown housing on Montgomery Street, including the burned duplex, is just a two-minute walk away. Fixing Greenville may be a slow process, and it's unclear if the continuing case against the 10-year-old will slow it further or provide impetus to the effort. The boy is staying with his maternal grandmother, Tammy Reed, whose daughter died in the fire. The child lost his stepfather to AIDS in July. ""He's doing really good,"" Reed said of the boy Tuesday morning. No matter how the case turns out, the boy will bear scars forever, his attorney, David Rohrer, said last week. The boy will always know he was charged with killing his mother. ""He'll never be able to escape that,"" Rohrer said. In downtown Greenville, salons offered $5 haircuts Tuesday to raise money for the fire victims. The community wanted to help in any way it could, salon manager Hughes said. Whether that community can also bring Greenville out of its slump may depend on people like Sondra Jackson. Jackson, a letter carrier, walked her new route Monday down Montgomery Street. It was only her second day of work, she said, and she had no idea of the tragedy that unfolded in the burned duplex two weeks before. Jackson said she had just moved to Greenville from Palm Springs, California, where she was born and raised. ""The school system is better in this area, and it's just a better place to raise kids,"" she said. E-mail to a friend .","Fire killed five people, a 10-year-old boy faces murder and arson charges .

"(CNN)  -- South Africa's embattled police commissioner resigned Sunday as president of Interpol, a day after he took an extended leave of absence from his police duties, the international crime-fighting agency said in a statement. South Africa police commissioner Jackie Selebi, facing charges of corruption, has stepped down as boss of Interpol. Interpol's Secretary-General Ronald Noble received a resignation letter on Sunday from Jackie Selebi, who is facing charges of corruption related to his role as police commissioner, the agency said. The charges are not related to his leadership role in Interpol. In the letter, Selebi said he was resigning because he did not wish the allegations against him ""to bring the good work of this august body into disrepute."" ""Based on my experience of working with Mr. Selebi in his capacity as delegate, vice president and ultimately president of the organization, he has always conducted himself and acted in a way to enhance global security and police co-operation worldwide,"" Noble said in a statement. As to the charges Selebi faces, Noble said: ""Any such allegations should be prosecuted thoroughly, and the proper manner is for charges to be brought promptly before a court of law and not through media leaks and speculation."" On Saturday, South African President Thabo Mbeki told a news conference in Pretoria, South Africa, that Selebi had been given an ""extended leave of absence"" from his police duties, but that he was not being sacked. Mbeki said Selebi supported the decision -- taken midnight Friday and effective immediately -- to temporarily step down and that an acting commissioner had already been appointed to take his place. The National Prosecuting Authority said it will charge the police chief with ""corruption and defeating the administration of justice,"" Tladi Tladi, a spokesman for the agency told CNN. According to widespread media reports, the upcoming charges hinge on Selebi's dealings with Glen Agliotti, a convicted drug smuggler. The suspended police chief is alleged to have accepted at least 1.2 million Rand ($177,000) from Agliotti over a 5-year period, the South African daily Cape Argus reported. In return Selebi allegedly handed over confidential intelligence reports from the British authorities relating to Agliotti's suspected drug-trafficking activities, according to the newspaper. Tladi said the corruption charges were linked to Agliotti ""to a certain extent."" Agliotti recently received a 10-year suspended prison sentence in a drug case after entering into a plea bargain. He is also accused of involvement in the 2005 killing of mining magnate Brett Kebble, according to South African media reports. A court on Friday rejected an application to halt the prosecution by Selebi, who has been under investigation for around two years. Mbeki denied that he had been too slow in dealing with the fallout from the charges. ""I have said many times that if there was anyone who came to me with information indicating that the national commissioner had behaved improperly then I would act on such information. No one has come to me with such information,"" Mbeki said. E-mail to a friend .","Jackie Selebi, South African police chief, takes leave as faces corruption charges .

"(CNN) -- U.S. naval forces hunting pirates off Somalia detained six people this week who appeared to be pursuing a commercial shipping vessel, but soon released them because of a lack of evidence. A Yemeni Coast Guard boat patrols the Gulf of Aden for pirates  who threaten shipping. The Navy said on Saturday the six matched the description of suspected pirates aboard a skiff in the area. The naval crew saw the men throwing objects overboard before they picked up the  suspects. Investigators didn't say what was thrown overboard but said the evidence was not sufficient ""to hold the suspects for prosecution."" The detentions reflect the aggressive U.S.-led fight against piracy. The United States is spearheading an international naval task force in the waters off Somalia that launched in February after a rash of attacks. Participating ships are patrolling more than a million square miles of water, an area about four times the size of Texas, Navy officials have said. The Navy said it arrested the six on Friday after responding to a distress call from the Philippines-flagged MV Bison Express in the Gulf of Aden, between Yemen and Somalia. The ship, a livestock carrier, reported a small skiff containing six heavily armed pirates was pursuing it. The guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg arrived and found a skiff matching the description. A Seahawk helicopter flew from the Gettysburg over the skiff and reported seeing objects being thrown overboard, the Navy said. A team from the Gettysburg boarded the skiff, along with members of the U.S. Coast Guard Legal Detachment and detained the six suspected pirates. The U.S. officials transferred the suspects onto the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer, the flagship for the international anti-piracy task force, the Navy said, before releasing them. The attack on the Bison Express was the second one Friday on commercial shipping vessels in the Gulf of Aden, the Navy said. In the first incident, pirates attacked the MV Sea Green, which managed to fend them off by firing flares as the men approached, the Navy said.","U.S. military ship captures skiff off Somalia coast .

"(CNN) -- Colin Powell stirred up the Republican Party's very public internal debate about the direction of the party and asserted it's losing because it doesn't appeal to moderates like him. The Republican Party is losing ""men, woman, white, blacks and Hispanics,"" says Colin Powell. Two Republican leaders questioned Powell's GOP credentials. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Powell should leave the party. Former Vice President Dick Cheney said he thought he already had. Powell says he's still very much a Republican and said the party would be better off to include more moderates like him. ""The Republican Party is losing north, south, east, west; men, woman, white, blacks and Hispanics,"" Powell said in an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""I think the Republican Party has to take a hard look at itself and decide: What kind of party are we?"" As it has squabbled within the family, the party has wandered. Most analysts say it will get back on the right track when its next leaders emerge. Is Powell emerging as a voice of the moderates in the party? ""A spokesman is good,"" said Bill Schneider, CNN senior political analyst. ""A candidate would be better.""  Watch what CNN's Bill Schneider has to say about the debate » . The Republicans' family argument started shortly after the Democrats won the White House and added to their control of Congress. Conservatives blame moderates for the losses, saying the party didn't present a contrast with Democrats and the only way for it to be successful is to lean harder to the right. Limbaugh and Cheney emerged from the leadership vacuum -- Limbaugh from his legions of listeners and Cheney in his emergent role as the sole defender of the Bush White House. Powell provoked Limbaugh when he suggested the GOP's future was in peril if it went in the Limbaugh's direction. Limbaugh responded that Powell is part of the ""stale, the old, the worn-out GOP that never won anything."" Powell says the right has alienated undecided and independent voters and the only way for the GOP to return to power is to expand its narrow base. The former Pentagon commander of the 1991 Persian Gulf war has for the most part stayed out of politics since resigning as President's Bush's secretary of state in Bush's first term. Among Republicans, Powell, Cheney and Limbaugh are equally revered with favorability ratings in the 60s, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. But among all voters questioned, Powell has a favorability rate of 70 percent compared to 30 percent for Limbaugh. A poll a week ago found that Cheney had a favorability rate of 37 percent. ""Colin Powell is not the guy you want to pick a fight with,"" Schneider said. ""He's more popular than Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh combined. Between the two polls, Limbaugh's unfavorable rating among all respondents was 53 percent and Cheney's 55 percent. Former Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge, another moderate, sided with Powell in an interview with with CNN's John King on ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. The former Pennsylvania governor said the different wings of the party need to listen to each other and differences of opinions need to be less divisive. ""Rush Limbaugh has an audience of 20 million people. A lot of people listen daily to him and live by every word. But words mean things and how you use words is very important,"" Ridge said. ""It does get the base all fired up and he's got a strong following,"" Ridge continued. ""But personally, if he would listen to me and I doubt if he would, the notion is express yourself but let's respect others opinions and let's not be divisive."" Ridge, who ruled out a Senate bid earlier this month, also called for an end to personal attacks. ""Let's lead our party based on some principles that have been very much a part of who we are for decades. And let's be less shrill ... and particularly, let's not attack other individuals. Let's attack their ideas,"" said Ridge. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Mary Matalin challenged what she called the ""liberal-lite"" wing of the party and said Republicans win when they run on their conservative convictions. When [Powell] supports Barack Obama, one presumes he's supporting those principles and policies,"" Matalin said. ""Those are liberal principles and they spawn liberal policies. The road forward for Republicans is not to be 'liberal-lite,' "" said Matalin.  ""This debate is a long one and it always is taking place vigorously when we change through any new paradigm. What is the scope and the role of a government in a free state? Those are big principles, big ideas, and that's how we should go forward. And anybody who agrees with those ideas should be in the party. If you don't agree with those ideas, you can be in the other party,"" she said. On another talk show, former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove, who served with Powell and Cheney in the White House, took Limbaugh's side, saying he would choose the radio host over the former secretary of state if he ""had to pick between the two,"" in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""","Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Powell should leave GOP .

"(CNN) -- The mother and brother of a 31-year-old woman found strangled with her two young sons in the bedrooms of their home filed a wrongful death lawsuit Tuesday against the alleged killer -- the husband and father of the victims. Christopher Coleman has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bond. Christopher Coleman has pleaded not guilty in the triple homicide police say took place early in the morning on May 5 in the family home in the small southwestern Illinois city of Columbia. ""To strip the culpable party of all financial holdings -- all that he has now and all that he may ever have,"" is the aim of the suit, said a statement accompanying the suit filed in Monroe County circuit court by Angela DeCicco and Mario Weiss, the mother and brother of Sheri Coleman. ""To allow one penny of ill-gotten gain to be derived at the expense of Sheri, Garett and Gavin is not acceptable to those who dearly love them."" The money would go to a memorial fund set up for Coleman and her sons, Garett, 11, and Gavin, 9 and ""these funds will be used to erect a lasting tribute in the city of Columbia,"" according to the complaint. ""Our goal is to extract something positive from such a horrific and senseless tragedy and to honor the lives of my sister and her two young sons,"" Weiss said. The wrongful death suit also names Coleman's father, Ronald, and the Joyce Meyer Ministries, where Coleman worked until shortly after his family was killed, as ""respondents in discovery,"" which means they may be forced to hand over financial documents and information such as Coleman's personnel file, his work schedule and travel itineraries and the Ministries' employment policies. In addition, the suit tries to establish a timeline of events before and after the killings, saying the Colemans took the deed to their home in 2005, but six months ago, ownership was transferred to Christoper Coleman alone. ""Sheri did not voluntarily sign the deed transferring title to the residence to Christopher,"" the document says. Lawyers in the civil suit also allege that in the period between the killings and his arrest, Coleman removed personal property from the home. The suit asks that Coleman and anyone ""acting at his direction"" be forbidden from entering the home again and that he provide a list of items already removed. Coleman remains in jail after a judge denied bond.","Sheri Coleman, 2 sons killed in Columbia, Illinois, home .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Global warming could destabilize ""struggling and poor"" countries around the world, prompting mass migrations and creating breeding grounds for terrorists, the chairman of the National Intelligence Council told Congress on Wednesday. Climate change could increase flooding in coastal areas, like the flooding that hit the Philippines. Climate change ""will aggravate existing problems such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership and weak political institutions,"" Thomas Fingar said. ""All of this threatens the domestic stability of a number of African, Asian, Central American and Central Asian countries."" People are likely to flee destabilized countries, and some may turn to terrorism, he said. ""The conditions exacerbated by the effects of climate change could increase the pool of potential recruits into terrorist activity,"" he said. ""Economic refugees will perceive additional reasons to flee their homes because of harsher climates,"" Fingar predicted. That will put pressure on countries receiving refugees, many of which ""will have neither the resources nor interest to host these climate migrants,"" he said in testimony to the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. Reactions to the report broke down along partisan lines, with Democrats generally praising it and Republicans expressing doubts. Committee members had concerns about the report's secrecy, reliability and use of intelligence resources. Global warming may have a slight positive effect on the United States, since it is likely to produce larger farming yields, Fingar said . But it is also likely to result in storm surges that could affect nuclear facilities and oil refineries near coasts, water shortages in the Southwest and longer summers with more wildfires, the study found. International migration may also help spread disease, Fingar added, and climate change could put stress on international trade in essential commodities. ""The United States depends on a smooth-functioning international system ensuring the flow of trade and market access to critical raw materials, such as oil and gas, and security for its allies and partners. Climate change and climate change policies could affect all of these,"" he warned, ""with significant geopolitical consequences."" The report was the conclusion of the most comprehensive government analysis the U.S. intelligence community has ever conducted on climate change. Fingar emphasized that it could make no hard and fast predictions, saying that the operative word in his assessment was ""may."" Wealthy countries will be able to handle the situation better than poorer ones, he said. ""We assess that no country will be immune to the effects of climate change, but some will be able to cope more effectively than others,"" he said. ""Most of the struggling and poor states that will suffer adverse impacts to their potential and economic security are in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Central and Southeast Asia. ""However, the spillover -- from potentially increased migration and water-related disputes -- could have a harmful global impact,"" he added. Fingar painted a mixed picture of the effects of climate change on the United States itself. ""Most studies suggest the United States as a whole will enjoy modest economic benefits over the next few decades, largely due to the increased crop yields,"" he said. ""Costs begin to mount thereafter, however, and some parts of the United States -- particularly built-up coastal areas -- will be at greater risk of extreme weather events and potentially high costs related to losses in complex infrastructure."" The impact of fighting and preparing for climate change may be greater than the effect of global warming itself, Fingar said. ""Government, business and public efforts to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies to deal with climate change -- from policies to reduce greenhouse gases to plans to reduce exposure to climate change or capitalize on potential impacts -- may affect U.S. national security interests even more than the physical impacts of climate change itself,"" he said. The report, the ""National Intelligence Assessment on the National Security Implications of Global Climate Change to 2030,"" relied on U.S. government, military, academic and United Nations studies of climate change. The report itself is classified, which some members of the House committee objected to. ""I am disappointed it is classified,"" said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California. Secrecy ""prevents this report from being released and discussed in public domain."" Committee Chairman Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he would ask the administration to declassify it. Markey opened the hearing by saying ""human beings all over the planet face death or damage or injury if we do not act."" He blasted the White House stance on climate change, saying, ""The Bush administration continues to limit what their experts know. The president doesn't want America to know the real risk of global warming."" Republicans on the committee criticized the report as wasteful, with Rep. Darrell Issa of California calling it a ""dangerous diversion of intelligence resources."" Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, said that the report was unreliable and that its authors admitted as much. ""We have a lot of information where we are incapable of assessing it,"" Fingar conceded. Hoekstra also questioned the committee's priorities. ""There are a lot more pressing issues out there for the intelligence community to be focused on right now that would help keep America safe,"" he said. The assessment ""was a waste of time, a waste of resources for the intelligence community to be focused on this issue versus other folks in the government that could have done this job and have a responsibility for doing it."" Fingar said the intelligence community had relied on the science of others because it did not itself monitor climate change. He said the assessment was based on midrange predictions of global warming.","Climate change could destabilize ""weak"" states, intelligence chair says .

"EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, California (CNN) -- Space shuttle Atlantis landed Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base after rainy weather in Florida precluded a landing at Kennedy Space Center. The space shuttle Atlantis touches down at Edwards AFB on Sunday. The shuttle touched down at 8:39 a.m. PT at Edwards, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, California. Within seven to 10 days, the shuttle will be transported from California to Florida on the back of a modified 747 jumbo jet, NASA said in a statement. Atlantis' next flight is scheduled for November. Rainy weather postponed the shuttle landing both Friday and Saturday. NASA had said that Atlantis conceivably could have remained in space until Monday, but wanted to land the shuttle Sunday.  Watch Atlantis land at Edwards Air Force Base » . Weather conditions in Florida were better Sunday than Saturday, NASA officials said, but atmospheric conditions were still too unstable for a landing at Kennedy. It was the 53rd time the shuttle has landed at Edwards, NASA officials said. In the early days of the space shuttle program, Edwards was its primary landing site. Shuttles have landed 70 times at Kennedy Space Center, NASA said, and once at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. Atlantis launched May 11 for NASA's final repair visit to the Hubble Space Telescope. Shuttle astronauts conducted five spacewalks during the mission to perform routine repairs and replace key instruments, in what has been called one of the most ambitious space repair efforts ever attempted. Hubble was released back into orbit Tuesday morning. The telescope was rejuvenated with instruments designed to improve its capabilities by as much as 70 times, while extending its lifetime through at least 2014, according to the NASA statement. ""This is not the end of the story but the beginning of another chapter of discovery by Hubble,"" Ed Weiler, associate administrator for science at NASA headquarters, said in the statement. ""Hubble will be more powerful than ever, continue to surprise, enlighten and inspire us all, and pave the way for the next generation of observatories."" Hubble, which has been in space for nearly two decades, can capture clear images that telescopes on Earth cannot, partly because it does not have to gaze through murky atmospheres.

Nothing about Young's childhood ever made him think he could be the mayor of Philadelphia, Mississippi, the town best known for the killings of three civil rights workers in 1964. That's the way it was for black kids growing up in this crucible of racial hostility -- big dreams were often squelched. Sitting on a sprawling Southern front porch this week, Young broke down in tears about what it means to be elected the town's first black mayor. ""When you've been treated the way we've been treated,"" he told CNN, choking up and then pausing to wipe the tears from his face.  Watch tearful Young describe victory » . For a moment, he couldn't speak. He then regrouped, ""That's why it's so overwhelming to be a part of this history."" This week, the 53-year-old Young was elected the mayor of Philadelphia, a town of about 8,000 in the east-central part of the state. Despite a 55 percent white majority, Young defeated Rayburn Waddell, a white, three-term incumbent, by the slim margin of 46 votes.  See where the town is located » . Young described the victory as ""an atomic bomb of change."" Another resident rejoiced, saying Young's win symbolized the scab finally falling off this town's wound. ""I couldn't even have wrote that in a fairy tale,"" Young said. ""Who would have thought a little country boy like me would be mayor of Philadelphia, Mississippi?"" Philadelphia was the site of one of the most notorious killings of the civil rights era. On June 21, 1964, three civil rights workers -- James Chaney, a 21-year-old black man from Mississippi; Andrew Goodman, 20, and  Michael Schwerner, 24, both activists from New York -- were shot to death at the edge of town. The killings inspired the 1988 movie ""Mississippi Burning."" ""Philadelphia will always be connected to what happened here in 1964,"" said Jim Prince, the publisher of the Neshoba Democrat newspaper. ""But the fact that Philadelphia, Mississippi, with its notorious past, could elect a black man as mayor, it might be time to quit picking on Philadelphia, Mississippi."" Young knows his slim margin of victory means he still has to earn the trust of many more voters here. He knows there are still some in town who won't vote for him because he's black, but he says that number gets smaller and smaller as time passes. ""We have some -- a very small pocket -- that will never change. That's what we've got to deal with,"" said Young. The mayor-elect says his election symbolizes a dramatic shift away from his hometown's racist past. And for many black residents, it means they can finally call this place home. ""The places where we were locked out, I'm gonna have the key,"" he said. ""The places we couldn't go, I've got the key. No better way to say it than that."" He takes special pride that his victory comes the same year the nation swore in its first African-American president in Barack Obama. ""It inspired people,"" Young said. ""There are times and seasons, I think, for everything. The season arrived and the people let me know it was my time."" The mayor-elect says he won by shaking hands and knocking on doors all over town. But the groundwork for Young's climb to the top of Philadelphia's political world started decades ago. Young was one of the first black students to integrate Philadelphia's white schools. After graduating from high school, he worked in a motor factory and then as a hospital housekeeper. A white boss noticed Young's charming people skills and recommended that he become a paramedic. He eventually worked his way up to become the director of the EMT unit, and that catapulted him to his first elected job as a county supervisor in 1991. He is also a Pentecostal minister preaching on Sunday and organizing weekly Bible studies. ""I've been prepping for this. I felt like I knew enough people. I felt like they knew me and that if I could convince them to just give me the opportunity, things could happen,"" said Young. Driving around Philadelphia in a 1981 Ford pickup truck, Young basked in the glow of victory. He calls it the ""honeymoon"" period. As we drove down the road, black and white residents cheered. ""We're so happy,"" screamed one lady. Young shouted back, ""We did it!"" Until he's sworn in as mayor, Young will work out of a makeshift transition office provided by a prominent attorney. His victory might seem unlikely but there's little time left to celebrate. ""It's an awesome feeling to have that kind of respect that people support you in this way,"" Young said near the end of our interview. ""I'll never let the people down which called for that.""","Philadelphia, Mississippi, elects first black mayor .

"(CNN) -- Pirates attacked a Japanese cargo ship off the coast of Somalia on Sunday, a Japanese Transportation Ministry official said. A french navy helicopter watches over a cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden earlier this year. A pair of small pirate vessels fired on a ship operated by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines about 4 p.m. Somali time (9 a.m. ET), damaging the front of the ship, but not seriously, according to Masami Suekado. There were no injuries. The exact number and makeup of the crew were not immediately known, although none of the crew members is Japanese, Suekado said. Pirating off Somalia has increase over the past four or five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative. The crime, which is hard to prevent, has raised concerns internationally. In 2008, pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau. In response, a number of countries have deployed ships from their navies to the region, including the United States, China and Japan. Two Japanese destroyers set sail earlier this month on an anti-piracy mission off Somalia, the Japanese defense ministry said.","Pirates attack Japanese cargo ship off the coast of Somalia .

"CANNES, France (CNN) -- After eleven days, hundreds of screenings and thousands of snaps from the paparazzi, there could only be one Palme d'Or winner. Austrian director Michael Haneke hugs the president of the Cannes jury, French actress Isabelle Huppert. ""The White Ribbon,"" by Austrian director Michael Haneke, was awarded the prize for its depiction of the cruel punishments meted out at a rural German school before the First World War. ""The Palme d'Or is the best prize a filmmaker can win,"" said Haneke at a press conference following his award. ""I am not proud, but I am very happy. In my opinion, it's silly to be proud.""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Natalia Vodianova is the Russian supermodel and philanthropist described by designer Tom Ford as ""the most beautiful woman in the world."" Natalia Vodianova: ""I think protecting your family and giving to them is the most important achievement."" Natalia, 27, is a mother of three and has set up her own children's charity. The woman nicknamed ""Supernova"" tells My City_My Life about her tough childhood, her love of Moscow and why Russian vodka is the best. CNN: How would you describe Moscow? Natalia Vodianova: It's a city of contrasts. You have this great culture and traditions that are very normal, calm and established. And then you have explosions of emotion, craziness, art, and young people who are so proud to be Muscovites and really trying to be individuals. Moscow is a huge inspiration for me. I love what I find here, I love being here. CNN: What would you change about Moscow given the chance? NV: Definitely the way it's treated at the moment, the way the government wants to renovate the old buildings. To me it's a little bit sad because in the West people have a very different mentality about renovating buildings, keeping them as intact as possible. Watch Natalia Vodianova take CNN on a tour of Moscow. » . CNN: What's the fashion in Moscow? NV: You see women in jeans wearing very high heels and a short puffy jacket. It's really funny! CNN: Tell me about your childhood . NV: I was born in Nizhny Novgorod to a very poor family and unfortunately my father and mother separated when I was very little. She was a single mum and had two more girls. It was a struggle but we all worked really hard and stood up for each other. My mum was amazing; she never drank, she never smoked -- she lived for us. I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me. CNN: Is family very important to you? NV: I think protecting your family and giving to them is so important. It's the most important achievement. CNN: How did your modeling career take off? NV: I went to Paris when I was 17. I was lucky because my career kind of gradually built up over two years -- I always had good work but I wasn't a star straight away. In fact, my agency thought that I might never do shows because I was a bit shorter and not skinny enough, but when I gave birth to my first son I was 19 and I lost a lot of weight. I guess the stress on the body was extreme and I suddenly just turned into this stick -- just the way designers love models. My career took off after Lucas was born because I opened a lot of shows on the runway and that's where a lot of stars are made in my industry. See Natalia Vodianova's Moscow in photos. » . CNN: If you weren't a model, what would your life be like? NV: It's very hard to say what my life would be like if I hadn't gone to Paris. People say I didn't change very much but I don't think that's true. I'm a happy person and even if I thought that I was happy then, I had so much baggage to carry with me: my background, people's expectations, the fact that I wasn't a perfect student and I wasn't going to school all the time -- I didn't live a normal life at all. That's not with me anymore, because of my success. It really doesn't matter because I know I have learned so much more than a lot of other girls who have had perfect childhoods. CNN: Tell us about the charity and what you are trying to achieve with it? NV: I started my foundation in 2005, after the Beslan tragedy [the 2004 school siege in which at least 339 hostages were killed]. I was in Moscow at the  time and it just struck me so much. I went back to New York, where I was living at the time, organized a fundraising event and raised $350,000 to build a playground for the children that had survived in the area. I believe that play is very therapeutic. It's really the only way for these children to forget about what happened and just be children, even if it's only for five minutes. But then I realized that it would be good for all the other children in Russia and I just started raising money and building playgrounds. Now we have 23 places all over Russia and we are building 15 more this year and planning to build more. I want to fulfill my dream of building 500 play parks in Russia. Each one will cost about $300,000 so it's a big dream -- an expensive one! CNN: Let's talk about vodka... NV: Our vodka is definitely the best. It's a very pure, good drink and it goes with Russian food. Generally I don't drink vodka outside Russia, but when you come to Russia there is no reason to order a glass of wine. CNN: What do you think of your nickname -- Supernova? NV: I don't mind being called Supernova. If one nickname is going to stick, that's not a bad one! CNN: Which five words best describe Moscow? NV: It's mysterious, cultural, exciting, crazy and spiritual.","Natalia Vodianova is a Russian supermodel and has started a children's charity .

"(CNN) -- Sidney Frank made millions marketing Jagermeister and other alcohol brands. Three years after his death, he's a big hit with students at the Ivy League college he briefly attended. Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University. He's a big hit not because of what he sold but because he's given dozens of them what he couldn't afford as a young man: an education at Rhode Island's Brown University. On Sunday, 49 students from low-income families became the first four-year Sidney E. Frank Scholars to graduate from Brown, owing virtually nothing except gratitude to the late liquor magnate. ""The world of difference that he made for each and every one of us is unbelievable, incredible,"" one of the Frank Scholars, 22-year-old Shane Reil, said Sunday. Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004. He stipulated that the fund's income go exclusively to covering all tuition and expenses for the neediest of Brown's admitted applicants.  Hear graduates say how their dreams came true » . For this year's graduates, tuition and expenses came to a four-year total of about $180,000 each. The median annual income of the recipients' families was $18,984. The gift was the largest single one ever given to Brown and one of the largest ever given for undergraduate scholarships in the United States, according to the school. Reil, a history major who is preparing to co-chair a student conference on U.S.-South Korean relations and aspires to work in politics or foreign service, says the scholarship was the stuff of dreams. He was working up to 40 hours a week during high school so he could pay for clothes and even help with grocery bills. He and his mother were getting by, but the Massachusetts native thought community college or a big state school would be all he could afford. When his academic achievements put Brown in his sights, he thought he'd have to go into too much debt to go there. But he applied anyway, and Brown invited him to campus to tell him about how much the school would award him. ""I sat in this guy's office ... and he said, '$37,000 for tuition,' "" Reil recalled. ""I said, ""$37,000, that's going to be split over four years, so essentially I'm getting a $10,000 scholarship per year.' ""He said, 'No, no, that's $37,000 for this year, and it will be covered [the rest of the years] too.' "" Reil said he cried in the office and ran to his car, where his mother was waiting. ""She was crying so much, we had to sit in the car for so long because she couldn't drive. It was a great moment,"" Reil said. ""Having the opportunity to go to a really good school ... I think it took my world from a very small area and physical space and just expanded it in multitudes,"" he said. Though other universities give full rides, Frank's gift was a coup for Brown. Like many other schools, Brown used to factor a family's ability to pay when deciding whether to accept students. Brown no longer does that, and Frank's gift was ""integral"" in bringing the change, said Jim Miller, Brown's dean of admissions. The school intends to give 30 to 35 Frank scholarships per year. Most recipients are the first in their families to go to college, Miller said. That was the case for Eliana Reyes Castro, who was born in the Dominican Republic and came to the United States when she was 6. She said she attended a Massachusetts high school that had regained its accreditation only months before she graduated. Like Reil, she was one of the Frank Scholars who graduated Sunday. She received a degree in education with a concentration in human development and will pursue a master's in secondary social studies and history at Brown. She might have attended Brown even if she had to take out loans. But that might have taken her away from what she wanted to do -- teach -- in favor of something that she had less interest in but paid more, she said. ""Just teaching right after college ... might not have been as appealing if I had loans to worry about,"" Reyes Castro said. Frank, though he went to Brown only one year, landed an engineering job at Pratt & Whitney in part because someone there had gone to the school, said his daughter, Cathy Halstead. The company sent him overseas and he worked on Allied airplane engines during World War II, she said. Eventually he got into the liquor business, started the Sidney Frank Importing Co. and marketed Jagermeister and Grey Goose vodka in the United States. He took up Jagermeister in the 1970s, sending attractive young women to bars to persuade patrons to try the drink and coming up with the Jagermeister tap machine. He created Grey Goose, had it distilled in France and brought it into the United States through importers. In 2004, he sold Grey Goose for $2.2 billion, said Halstead, 61, of Seattle, Washington. When Brown gave him an honorary degree in 2005, not long after his gift and months before his January 2006 death, people gave him a hero's welcome, she said. ""People on both sides [of a procession] were yelling his name and yelling, 'Jager!' and yelling, 'Goose!' "" she said. He gave millions of dollars to other institutions and projects. As for the Brown scholarship fund, he started it because he saw that Brown had changed the course of his life, Halstead said. ""He really wanted kids who were coming from very economically challenged backgrounds to have the chance to make it all the way through,"" said Halstead, who attended Sunday's graduation ceremony. Reil and Reyes Castro said they couldn't thank Frank enough if he were alive. ""What he did is a catalyst for a lot of great things, and I'm indebted to him to do the best with the education that I've gotten here to help people in any way that I can,"" Reyes Castro said.","Sidney Frank left $100 million to Brown University months before he died .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- California's highest court upheld a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages Tuesday but allowed about 18,000 unions performed before the ban to remain valid. Protesters gather outside the California Supreme Court in San Francisco on Tuesday. Supporters of November ballot initiative Proposition 8 hailed the ruling, but about 1,000 advocates of same-sex marriages who gathered outside the court building in San Francisco met the 6-1 decision with chants of ""Shame on you."" Following the ruling, supporters of same-sex marriage took to the streets to protest. CNN affiliate KGO reported that after the opinion was made public lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender officers were brought in specifically to help manage the crowd. During those protests 159 adults and three juveniles were arrested and cited for jaywalking, San Francisco Police Department Sgt. Lyn Tomioka told CNN. Similar rallies were held Tuesday evening in Los Angeles, where 3,500 to 5,000 protesters took part, according to police estimates. There were no arrests, said Julianne Sohn of the Los Angeles Police Department. There were also reports of demonstrations in San Diego and some other California cities, as well as in major cities nationwide. iReport.com: Rally in San Diego . Lisa Angelot and Karen Brandenberger were married when it was legal, but they said their own marriage is not enough, and told KGO they were prepared to be arrested to make the point. ""It will be my first time to be arrested,"" Angelot told KGO. Many supporters said it was most upsetting to have the right to marry yanked away from them after last year's court ruling. ""It is impossible to square the elation that we felt just a year ago with the grief that we feel today,"" said Kate Kendell, head of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. ""And it is impossible to reconcile the court's ruling from a year ago with its upholding of Proposition 8 today."" The same court, dominated by Republican appointees, ruled in May 2008 that the state constitution guaranteed gay and lesbian couples the ""basic civil right"" to marry. Voters responded in November by approving the marriage ban by a margin of 52 to 48 percent. iReport.com: React to court decision and share photos, video . Opponents of the ban argued that it improperly altered California's constitution to restrict a fundamental right guaranteed in the state charter. Its supporters argued that Californians long have had the right to change their state constitution through ballot initiatives. Tuesday's ruling found that the proposition restricted the designation of marriage ""while not otherwise affecting the fundamental constitutional rights of same-sex couples,"" as Chief Justice Ronald George wrote. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Carlos Moreno -- the court's only Democratic appointee -- wrote that the decision ""is not just a defeat for same-sex couples, but for any minority group that seeks the protection of the equal protection clause of the California Constitution.""  Watch what was at stake » . The decision sparked protests in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. ""It's nice that my marriage is still intact, but that's not the point,"" said Kathleen White, who was among those awaiting the ruling in San Francisco. ""The point is that everybody should have the same civil rights across the board."" But Miles McPherson, pastor of the Rock Church in San Diego, said the court ""did the right thing."" Voters in 28 other states have approved constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, and none has been rejected, he said. ""God didn't create the family that way,"" McPherson said. ""You can't have a family with a mother and a mother, because [children] need a mother and a father to nurture their personality and their character."" Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, said the ruling ""should encourage pro-family activists not only in California but across the country."" But he said that by preserving marriages performed before the ban, the justices could have opened a door to a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. It was unclear whether advocates had an avenue to appeal Tuesday's ruling, however. And Dennis Herrera, San Francisco's city attorney, said the fight for same-sex marriage rights would most likely go on ""in the electoral arena."" ""Today we're faced with a disappointing decision,"" Herrera said. ""But I think we also know it could have been worse.""  View reactions to the ruling » . A new effort, dubbed Yes on Equality, has begun working to place an initiative on the 2010 ballot that would repeal Proposition 8. State justices left unaddressed whether same-sex marriages performed in other states before the ban was adopted would be recognized in California, and advocates would have to argue that the measure violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. California took its first steps toward recognizing same-sex marriages in 2004, when San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. iReport.com: React to court decision and share photos, video . Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who opposed the initiative, praised the court for leaving the previous marriages intact and urged opponents of the decision to respond ""peacefully and lawfully."" ""While I believe that one day either the people or courts will recognize gay marriage, as governor of California, I will uphold the decision of the California Supreme Court,"" Schwarzenegger said in a written statement. Four states -- Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and Iowa -- currently allow same-sex marriages. A Vermont law making such marriages legal will take effect in September. And the District of Columbia voted May 5 to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, though it does not itself give marriage licenses to same-sex couples.","NEW: Police: 162 same-sex marriage supporters arrested during protests .

"(CNN) -- A former federal prosecutor was arrested Wednesday on charges related to the murder of a witness in a drug case, among many other counts, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark, New Jersey, said. Former federal prosecutor Paul Bergrin is charged with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included a murder. Paul Bergrin and three others were taken into custody after a federal grand jury in New Jersey indicted them on 14 counts, including murder, racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering charges, a statement from Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph J. Marra Jr. said. The indictment charges Bergrin with leading a racketeering conspiracy that included the murder of a witness in a drug case and an attempt to hire a hit man in another drug case, the statement said. Bergrin also is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, Marra said. Gerald Shargel, Bergrin's attorney, said his client would plead not guilty to all charges. ""This is largely dredging up old issues, and we intend to vigorously fight the charges,"" Shargel said. The U.S. Attorney's Office statement said Bergrin was involved in the murder of a confidential witness in one federal drug case and tried to hire a Chicago, Illinois, hit man to kill a witness in another drug case. The second killing never occurred, the statement said, because the proposed hit man was a cooperating witness in the case. Marra called Bergrin's alleged conduct ""simply shocking."" ""A licensed lawyer, a former prosecutor essentially became one of the criminals he represents, supporting, encouraging, indeed directing, a criminal enterprise that engaged in murder and murder conspiracies, drug trafficking and financial fraud,"" Marra said in the statement. ""Bergrin can now expect to feel the full weight of the very legal system he turned on its head with his conduct."" Bergrin was an assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey before going into private practice. According to the New York Law Journal, Bergrin, 53, pleaded guilty this month to two misdemeanor counts for his involvement with a prostitution ring.  He later represented U.S. Army Sgt. Javal Davis, one of seven people charged in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq. In that case, Davis entered a plea agreement on reduced charges before his court martial began. A recorded message at Bergrin's Newark, New Jersey, office said it was closed today, and messages left with Bergrin's cell phone and the cell phones of two associates went unanswered.","Paul Bergrin arrested after federal grand jury indicts him and 3 others on 14 counts .

I look at this like a job, and I work hard at it, and it helps me live better,"" says Deolindo Farias, 66, who brings fresh bananas and mandarins every week and trades them for household items like flour and sugar. Barters Clubs boomed in Argentina following the country's 2001 economic meltdown when jobs, security and cash were scarce. Club officials say during 2002 more than 2 million people participated in the clubs on a regular basis. In recent years, as Argentina's economy bounced back, fewer people showed up, but ever since the global financial crisis hit last year, they say the barter clubs are more popular than ever.  Watch how the clubs are helping poor Argentines » . ""It's a reality now. In these past few months there has been a big increase. For example, we now have 400 people every Saturday. It used to only be 300. People are traveling here from other neighborhoods so they can barter too,"" says Juan Maccarone, president of the La Matanza Barter Club. Nelly Vasquez, 29, goes to the club because she has no other options. She lost her job at a clothing factory last year, and has been going to the barter club every week since January -- often with her six-month-old daughter, Antonella, in tow. ""I come here because I don't have a job, and this is the only way for me to survive and get the things that I need,"" says Vasquez, who trades wool and women's shoes for pasta and rice. For others, the barter clubs offer something that every consumer on a budget seeks: a bargain. ""If you go to the supermarket, they charge 10 or 15 pesos for a bottle of cooking oil. Here, I can get it with 50 or 80 club credits. That's only 4 or 5 pesos -- that's a big difference,"" says Maria Rosa Araya, 37. By all accounts, Argentina was the first Latin American country to have the barter clubs. The idea has now spread to other countries, like Uruguay, Colombia and Venezuela. There's even a burgeoning barter club circuit across the Atlantic Ocean in Spain. Organizers say barter clubs are evidence that in tough times, economies can thrive -- or survive -- on their own, when it's the people calling the shots. ""The golden rule at barter clubs is to offer an honest product for an honest price,"" says Ruben Ravera, co-founder of Argentina's Red Global de Trueque (Global Barter Network). ""It's a concept that could help solve the world's economic problems. Think about it,"" he says.","Barter clubs opening around Argentina show extent of country's economic crisis .

"(CNN) -- A Texas woman tearfully recounted the death of her foster child at the hands of a schoolteacher during a congressional hearing Tuesday looking into the use of seclusion and restraints in U.S. schools. The House Committee on Education and Labor heard testimony Tuesday on a report looking at school abuse. The hearing came on the heels of a report issued by the investigating arm of Congress that documents widespread abuse of techniques use to restrain or discipline special-education students. The Government Accountability Office report was prepared for the House Committee on Education and Labor, which heard testimony from parents, investigators and experts who described traumatizing punishment of special-needs children. The violent acts -- from hours of isolation in locked rooms or closets to the use of handcuffs and pinning children on the floor -- often led to serious injuries and even death, witnesses said. Committee Chairman Rep. George Miller, D-California, called the testimony ""startling."" ""This is just unacceptable,"" he said. ""This punishment is way out of bounds of what I believe are the social norms of this society."" Toni Price of Killeen, Texas, told committee members that her 14-year-old foster child, Cedric, died in March 2002 when his eighth-grade teacher's disciplinary actions went too far. His death was one of the cases investigated by the GAO -- and the teacher, who is now working in a Virginia high school, has been placed on leave as a result of the congressional investigation. Price said Cedric was experiencing behavioral problems in school and on that particular day he stopped working at 11 a.m. His teacher withheld his lunch. Around 2:30, still without having eaten, Cedric tried to leave the classroom. Her voice shaking and tears welling in her eyes, Price said the teacher, whom she described as over 6 feet tall and weighing 230 pounds, forced the boy in a chair and restrained him. Price said Cedric, a small boy, struggled, so the teacher put him face down and sat on him. ""I can't breathe,"" he said. ""If you can speak, you can breathe,"" the teacher said, according to Price's testimony. Shortly after that, Cedric stopped struggling, and then stopped moving altogether. The teacher continued to restrain him as an aide wiped drool off his face, Price said. They then sat him up in the chair but Cedric slumped over and slid off, Price said. He was dead before Price could get to the school. ""If I treated Cedric that way at home, I'd be in jail,"" Price told lawmakers. Cedric's death was ruled a homicide, Price said, but the teacher never faced trial. She was placed on a Texas registry of individuals found to have abused children but, despite the listing, she now teaches at a public high school in Virginia, Price told the committee. Tuesday morning, the American Association of School Administrators told the committee that the teacher involved in Price's death had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. The school system acted after the GAO referred its findings to the state school board, the organization reported. Price questioned why the crimes of pedophiles are public but teachers who torture children are free to continue working without disclosure of their past actions. Government auditors examined hundreds of allegations of abuse, the GAO report said. In 20 of those cases, it said, children died after being put in restraints. In four of those, the restraints were found to have resulted in the children suffocating. GAO investigator Greg Kutz told the House committee Tuesday that he lacked data to quantify the problem, but in the 2008 school year, investigators discovered 33,000 instances of seclusion, restraints or other punishments in Texas and California alone. Despite the problem, Kutz said, no federal regulations exist on the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having ""special needs,"" conditions including autism and Down syndrome. At the state level, the laws are widely divergent -- 19 states have no laws at all. Auditors found that eight states prohibit prone restraints or other techniques that hinder breathing, and 17 require teachers or staff to be trained in proper techniques before using them. Only six keep records of how frequently those techniques are used, and reports are required by law in only two of those states -- California and Connecticut. The GAO investigation found that teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs. In 13 states, parents have to agree before teachers can restrain children in non-emergency situations, while 19 require teachers to notify parents after the fact. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their children were being disciplined until after they began to behave badly at home, which to them indicated trouble at school. When confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true, according to parents and the GAO report. Miller's committee is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students. Abbie Boudreau and Steve Turnham of the CNN Special Investigations Unit contributed to this report .","New GAO report shows abuse of techniques used to restrain special-ed kids .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday urged urban leaders and policymakers they need to take the lead now in fighting climate change. Bill Clinton to urban leaders in Seoul: What will you do about climate change? ""What are you going to do and how much are you going to spend?"" Clinton asked leaders from the world's biggest cities at a climate summit being held in South Korea's capital, Seoul. Officials from the world's 40 biggest cities plus 17 affiliate municipalities are attending the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which ends on Thursday. Waiting for nations to take the lead with a new climate protocol in Copenhagen in December is not an option, said David Miller, mayor of Toronto and chairman of the C40 Cities Leadership Group. ""If governments talk about reducing CO2 (carbon dioxide), cities are the ones that show how it's done,"" Miller said. ""The point is that cities act, and working together we have a scale and a size that we dramatically increase people's ability to fight climate change. ""The challenge for national governments is that while they can sometimes reach agreement they don't know how to act collectively,"" Miller continued. ""For cities, that's easier. We all have climate strategies, but can make our actions work better and make the partnerships to do that."" The Seoul summit is the third conference by cities held to discuss responses to climate change. The C40 group was established in London in 2005. A second summit was held in New York in 2007.  Watch efforts to make New York's Empire State Building more eco-friendly » . Much of the talk at this week's conference was how major urban centers could work toward adhering to the Kyoto Protocol, the existing environmental treaty that sets targets for nations to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. Adopted in December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol entered into force in February 2005. In countries that did not sign up to the Kyoto agreement, cities took it upon themselves to reduce their carbon footprint. While the United States did not sign Kyoto, 825 U.S. cities and towns signed up to a climate protection agreement that embraced that protocol's goals. Some nations that signed Kyoto have set more ambitious environmental targets. Copenhagen, for example, aims to be the world's first carbon neutral capital by 2025. Toronto, like other cities, will be sending a city delegation to Copenhagen for the U.N. summit in December. There to lobby governments and for a parallel cities summit, Miller hopes that the actions that cities are taking now, and the partnership that he expects to be made while in Seoul this week, will serve as examples that the carbon reduction goals can be reached. ""Copenhagen is very important for all countries to agree, because we are losing the battle. Cities will be there and we're going to be very active. We'll have credibility because we are actually doing things. We'll be able to say to governments that they need to engage, empower and resource cities so we can accomplish the goals."" How to actually reduce CO2 emissions is the purpose of the Seoul summit, Clinton reminded delegates. Representing around 600 million people worldwide, mayors and policymakers in Seoul have the ability to make a difference with climate change policies, the former U.S. president added. If the methods of reducing a city's carbon footprint are known there is still the question of the means, which vary wildly between the first world urban areas such as Seoul, London and Toronto, and other attendees from cities in the developing world, such as Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Lagos, Nigeria. Miller believes that providing good examples of effective climate change policies and grasping the opportunity for cities to take the lead in planning for a low-carbon future should not be missed. He highlighted Toronto's own ""tower renewal"" project, retrofitting buildings in a run-down area of town that he hopes will be an example of a carbon-neutral urban renewal project that can be applicable elsewhere. New building projects in two areas of London and the creation of a new city in central Florida -- Destiny -- were among 16 projects announced at the summit as climate-positive initiatives and supported by the Clinton Climate Initiative. Once built, these projects will absorb more CO2 than they use, supporters claimed. Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon introduced the South Korean capital's ambitious environmental plans, including building a vast path of park land bisecting the capital. Delegates cited practical challenges they are facing. The spread of the H1N1 virus had crippled Mexico City's economy by scaring off tourists, officials from that city said at the summit. Without money, they said, even the most promising environmental plans can struggle. Luis Castaneda Lossio, the mayor of Lima, Peru, highlighted the initiatives his city is trying to pursue. Compared to Seoul's thousands of acres of parkland, he admitted they had struggled to plant 150 trees in the traffic-clogged city. ""Solidarity is essential!"" Lossio said with verve as a final remark during his address on making Lima a low-carbon city. It was a sentiment echoed by Miller, who highlighted the opportunities for cities such as Toronto to take a lead during the global economic recession. ""I've always believed in activist governments. The private sector is in retreat. The green agenda is a way to restart the economy by doing the right thing. If there are ways for the governments to create incentives, like grants for solar power, then you can kick-start the economy on the right path, but cities and government importantly have to do that now. We have a great opportunity.""","Summit of world's largest cities meeting in Seoul to discuss climate change .

"TRION, Georgia (CNN)  -- The Dodge Neon sped down Interstate 40 in eastern Oklahoma, its occupants heading to Phoenix, Arizona, to buy a load of dope. It was May 2005. The couple brought along methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana to help pass the time on the long journey. Paul Faulkner, 83, and his son, Michael Smith, were convicted in a drug smuggling ring in north Georgia. At that moment, Detective Rob Rumble had no clue that the traffic stop he was about to make would launch a years-long drug investigation stretching more than 2,000 miles, from the remote mountains of northwest Georgia all the way down to Mexico. The investigation showed how an 83-year-old grandfather adapted to the times, morphing from old school bootlegging to dealing Mexican dope. His son acted as the ringleader of the operation. His grandson was tied in too, authorities say. ""I've seen it all. Nothing surprises me,"" said Rumble, a drug investigator for the district attorney's office in east-central Oklahoma. After making that traffic stop, Rumble persuaded the nervous, lanky driver from Georgia to work with authorities and tell everything he knew. Investigators were led to a sleepy pocket of Georgia with scenic mountain views where people wave to strangers from their cars and where some homes still fly the Confederate flag.  Watch moonshine, marijuana and a family feud » . It's the last place one might expect drugs from Mexico. But the demand for drugs is reaching even the most remote corners of America. Their story has all the intrigue of a classic Southern novel -- three generations of a family business on the wrong side of the law, complete with an old fashioned family feud. ""When they're in that type of business, there's a reckoning day -- and apparently this is it,"" said Benny Perry, the 78-year-old mayor of Trion, Georgia, one of the towns where the family was operating. Perry is a barrel-chested man and speaks in a welcoming Southern accent. ""I'll say this, I was completely surprised,"" he said. ""I felt like we had a problem here, but I wouldn't have thought it was originating in Mexico and coming here."" The drugs, mostly marijuana, were trucked from Mexico through California and Arizona and then distributed across five counties in Georgia and one in Tennessee, authorities say. They were hidden in just about anything -- furniture, roofs of big-rigs and tire wells. Once the shipments arrived, the dope was put in 50-caliber ammunition cans and buried in the woods, where buyers would pick up the stash and leave behind thousands in cash, authorities say.  See where the family operated » . At the heart of the operation was 46-year-old Michael Leon Smith, who authorities say became one of the richest men in Chattooga County, population 25,000, as he laundered his drug money by buying up dozens of pieces of property. One tract of land sits on Old Justice Road, an ironic name considering the law finally caught up with him. Smith's 83-year-old father, Paul Leon Faulkner, was also busted. Eight others, including Faulkner's grandson (Smith's nephew), pleaded guilty to an array of charges related to the drug ring. The drugs mostly involved marijuana, but methamphetamine and cocaine were also part of the smuggling operation, authorities say. ""We love it when somebody says they can't be caught,"" said Del Thomasson, a special agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation who worked the case. Faulkner, who is suffering from cancer, was handed a 20-year sentence last month and is to head to prison in August. ""Twenty years, that is a death sentence,"" said Giles Jones, Faulkner's attorney, adding that he has appealed the sentence. He said Faulkner was a ""full-time mountain shiner"" who could talk moonshine until he was ""blue in the face,"" but knew little about the Mexican marijuana operation. Jones said the old man's son ""threw his ass under the bus"" to save himself. ""It's a situation where I guess you're just looking out for yourself. It's every day as every day, man,"" said Jones. Not so fast, said Cathy Alterman, the defense attorney for Smith, Faulkner's son. ""Michael didn't throw his father under the bus. His father threw Michael down the drain when he was 16 years old,"" Alterman said. ""If the father got a longer sentence, it's because he's a lousy father. ... He was never there for his son, except to be a bad example."" Smith is serving a nine-year sentence in federal prison in Montgomery, Alabama. Faulkner's grandson is also serving a nine-year sentence. There is no parole in the federal system. Alterman said the sentences are excessive for people involved in dealing marijuana, a substance she says should be legalized. iReport.com: Time to legalize pot? ""Michael's a wonderful family man, a Christian -- which means a lot to him, a very religious man. And I point out that in the Bible, God gave us every seed-bearing plant, and I think Michael looked at it that way. And, unfortunately, our government since 1937 has not seen it as a God-given right."" Alterman is a defense attorney in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. She says about 90 percent of her clients are accused drug dealers, ""most of them out of Mexico."" Asked if Smith was dealing with people tied to Mexico's ruthless cartels, Alterman said, ""Yes.""  Learn more about Mexican cartels » . ""When you're selling in quantity -- all right, and Michael was selling in quantity -- you need someone who is able to give you a regular supply at a reasonable price, and so eventually Michael did end up buying from people who were from Mexico."" The cartels are so organized, the money so great, that when an operation like this family's is taken down, it doesn't take long for others to move in. ""Within 24 hours, if someone's arrested, someone else here already in the United States in the trade will take their place,"" Alterman said. ""America does not know that the fingers of the cartels are basically around the throat of America,"" she added, ""and it has spread out to rural America just as much as the inner city of Detroit."" Authorities agree. Nearly every rural community is facing a similar battle, with drug dealers taking up shop in small towns where law enforcement has less of a presence and where the nation's highways make for easy transport. ""I think people should care about what happens in a rural area, because let's face it, there are more rural areas than there are cities. Our community is not the only one affected,"" said GBI agent Thomasson. A Justice Department study released last year showed Mexican cartels had a presence in 230 U.S. cities, stretching from the U.S.-Mexican border to the Southeast and as far north as Alaska. The nation's rural communities are increasingly affected. See the cartels' urban hubs . ""Historically, rural America uses more alcohol and less drugs. That is changing,"" said Dr. H. Westley Clark, the director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. There have been few comprehensive studies over the last decade looking at the problem of drugs in rural America. According to a 2006 report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the use of illicit drugs in America is nearly the same in cities and rural areas, 8.7 percent compared to 7.8 percent respectively. Another report, in 2000 by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, found that eighth-graders living in rural America were 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana than in urban centers and 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine. In Trion, a town of about 2,000 people, a sign sits at the edge of the community in support of the local K-12 school. It reads, ""Trion Bulldogs deserve a drug free community to live and grow!!"" The words ""drug free"" are underlined. Many here are shocked to hear drugs from Mexico are coming through. Most don't like to talk on the record about the case because the family was well-known, even well-liked. ""You got a guy who's a drug dealer, but you have good people in a community. I mean, they don't have a clue what's going on,"" Thomasson said. The town's mayor, Perry, said it's difficult to reconcile a ""cordial"" local family with the serious drug convictions. ""You could talk to [them] ... and they would speak back,"" he said of Faulkner and Smith. ""That's a big thing up here in a small town. If you speak to somebody and they don't speak back, you think, 'Well, something's wrong here.' "" Perry said local authorities are trying ""to stamp out the local demand,"" adding, ""As long as we've got a market for it, they're gonna bring it up here."" Alterman, the defense attorney, agrees. ""Americans are screaming for drugs"" and there's millions to be made, she said. ""There's too much money involved.""","10 people, including grandpa, son and grandson, convicted on serious drug charges .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The election of 736 members from 27 member countries to the European Parliament in June will be the biggest transnational electoral contest there has ever been.  Between them they will represent more than 500,000,000 people. About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote. But few understand how the low-profile Parliament affects the lives of EU citizens. Here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about the contest. Who will be voting, when and where? About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote in the election of the parliament members for a five-year term. The elections will be held on Thursday, June 4 in the UK and the Netherlands. There will be voting on Friday, June 5 in Ireland and the Czech Republic. And it will begin on Saturday, June 6 in Cyprus, France, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia. The other countries will conduct their voting on Sunday, June 7. Elections will take place in all 27 member countries of the EU, with the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania included for the first time. How many MEPs are there and how many does each country elect? There will be 736 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the new assembly. The number each country has varies according to its population. Germany, with a population of 82 million, the biggest among EU states, will have 99 members. Malta, with a total population of just 410,000, will have only 5. Will that number stay the same if the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect? No. The Lisbon Treaty, designed to give the EU a new streamlined constitution for the EU (and to increase the powers of the European Parliament,) has been put on ice following its rejection in a referendum in Ireland, the only country to give electors a direct voice. But the Irish are due to vote again in the autumn. If they then vote Yes and all remaining EU states ratify the treaty, then the Parliament will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula. That means that 15 'ghost MEPs', will be elected on June 7, entitled to attend the Parliament but not to vote in it until the Lisbon Treaty goes through. What election system is used? That varies according to the individual states represented, but all will be using some variant of proportional representation. In some countries candidates will all be on a single national list, making the entire country a constituency. Others elect MEPs from regional constituencies. Many countries set a threshold, insisting that parties have to gain an overall proportion of the vote -- 5 per cent in France and Germany, 4 per cent in Sweden or Austria -- to qualify for any allocation of seats. Whom do the MEPs represent? Most would-be MEPs contest the elections with the endorsement of national political parties. National parties such as the Christian Democrats in Germany or the Labour Party in Britain put up approved lists of candidates. But when they are in the European Parliament the MEPs mostly operate in wider groups of left or right such as the Socialist Group (PES), the Liberal Group (ELDR) or the European Greens. The main conservative grouping is the European Peoples Party (EPP). However, David Cameron, the national leader of Britain's Conservatives, has withdrawn his members from the EPP, regarding it as too federalist in its approach. The groups work as a bloc when they can and have ""whips"" designed to make them as cohesive as possible. What powers do the MEPs have? Much legislation in member states actually originates at a European level. National legislatures pass laws which have begun life as directives from the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which the MEPs have helped to shape. They are the only elected part of the European apparatus which is otherwise dominated by European Councils (meetings of the prime ministers or finance or trade or interior ministers from the 27 nations) or the European Commission. Do MEPs really make much difference to ordinary people's lives? It may not feel like it, day to day, but MEPs often have more influence over the shaping of European legislation which filters down to national parliaments than the members of those national parliaments do when the laws get to them. Recent EU laws which have affected citizens directly include the ""roaming directive"" which restricted the charges mobile phone companies can impose on customers for calls in countries other than their own. EU directives have helped initiate the era of cut-price air travel. It was the EU which determined that telephone and data companies had to keep records for at least two years to help counter terrorism . And the so-called ""REACH"" directive has forced businesses to disclose what chemicals they use in their products and to ensure that they are safe. Because driving legislation through the European Parliament requires the building of cross-party coalitions more than 50 percent of amendments proposed in the European Parliament end up as law. That is why company lobbyists spent much time in Brussels trying to make their case to MEPs. But does the Parliament have any muscle? It has the rather drastic power to sack the European Commission. It also holds public hearings on newly-appointed Commissioners. The Parliament also has significant powers over how much of the European Union budget is spent. Although most legislation originates with the Commission, if more than 50 percent of MEPs back a resolution calling for new laws in a particular area the the Commission has to get down to work to propose some. The EU is one of the largest aid donors in the world, dispensing some $15 billion a year across five continents and MEPs have a significant say in that. Where is the European Parliament situated? Most of its meetings are held in Brussels close to the officials whose draft legislation is examined by the Parliament's subject committees. But, at a considerable cost, some plenary meetings are also held in Strasbourg, an arrangement which the French government has fought long and hard to maintain.","Election will be the biggest transnational electoral contest ever .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Stories about Sly Stone usually start with the word ""reclusive."" Sly Stone sometimes takes the stage at Los Angeles clubs with daughter Novena and her group, BabyStone. Don't call him that anymore, because the superstar who blended funk, rock, soul and psychedelic sounds in the 1960s and '70s before disappearing from the scene in the '80s is not in hiding, his youngest daughter said. Stone's media shyness in recent decades earned him a comparison to the late billionaire recluse Howard Hughes, but he's just been living his life and making his music out of the glare of great expectations that superstars suffer. ""It's not like he wasn't making music,"" said Novena Carmel, his 27-year-old daughter. ""He was enjoying his life and riding motorcycles, one of his passions."" Now 66, Sly Stone is talking to interviewers again and sometimes taking the stage at Los Angeles clubs with Novena and her group, BabyStone. ""She is the force that keeps him straight,"" said Anthony Valadez, a disc jockey with Los Angeles public radio station KCRW. ""I think it's her energy and their bond that is so sacred that keeps him in line. That's what brings Sly out."" The Sly and the Family Stone founder gave a rare interview to KCRW's ""Morning Becomes Eclectic."" Though it airs Monday, the interview was taped days ahead -- given Stone's 40-year reputation for not showing up for concerts and interviews. Sly Stone -- who was Sylvester Stewart before changing his name as a radio DJ -- didn't reminisce in the interview about past troubles. Guest host Chris Douridas kept the conversation about the music. He said he was a child, performing in his family's gospel group, The Stewart Four, when he first realized the power music has over people. It happened as he sang ""On the Battlefield"" during a Sam Cooke show at the Oakland Auditorium when he was 4. ""Towards the end of the song, people starting running down the aisle and I didn't know what was going on,"" he said. ""I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know they were just happy. So, I turned around and ran, and I've been running ever since."" Stone now says he didn't know then where he was heading. ""Where I was is where I was,"" he said. Stone wrote his first hit song for someone else. Bobby Freeman made ""Come On and Swim"" a Top 10 pop hit in summer 1964. When he formed Sly and the Family Stone in 1966, the mix of race and gender was unusual for its time. ""It was on purpose -- that's what I intended to do,"" Stone said. He recruited two white musicians -- drummer Greg Errico and saxophonist Jerry Martini. Though African-American women were mostly used as backup singers back then, Cynthia Robinson played the trumpet. Larry Graham's revolutionary style of ""slapping"" his electric bass guitar strings added to the Family Stone's groundbreaking sound. The songs appealed to white and blacks equally and regularly topped both the pop and R&B charts. Stone's lyrics often carried dual meanings. ""Hot Fun in the Summertime"" -- released in summer 1969 -- might be a tribute to the fun of summer days to one listener, while another might see satire about the summertime race riots of the late '60s. Stone set the stage for other superstars to follow, but the band dissolved after one hot decade and success became as elusive as Stone. Novena may understand her dad better than anyone these days. She's lured him back to the stage for several performances, which she avoids calling concerts. With those, ""people expect certain things,"" such as wanting performers to be what they were 30 years ago, she said. Instead, it's the ""Sly Stone Variety Show,"" which allows her father ""to do whatever he wants to do in the moment."" ""It's very wild, in the sense that they have the Sly Stone trivia game onstage with diehard fans,"" said Anthony Valadez, who has been to several. The show format is designed ""for him to connect with people and people to connect with him,"" his daughter said. Novena also knows to not plan too far ahead with her dad, so he doesn't have time to back out. ""If it's done quickly, then it works,"" she said. ""But if he has a tour, then there's a lot of expectations that you have to meet for everybody to be happy."" ""My dad would be like, 'I wanna do a show as soon as possible,'"" she said. That gives her just about a week to get the show together and promote it. P-funk architect George Clinton and actor-comedian Eddie Murphy showed up for the last one, which was a sold-out celebration of Stone's 66th birthday. One indication that Stone has changed his no-show habit, which marred his reputation in younger days, is he actually arrives for shows early, Valadez said. ""Coming early to these gigs, you watch Sly and his affection for his daughter and it's evidence he would do anything for her,"" he said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- London's newest hotelier Mark Fuller is showing commendable bravado for someone about to open a luxury hotel during a global recession. Entrepreneur Mark Fuller in the Sanctum Soho hotel, a rock'n'roll ""haven of hedonism"" in London. ""F*** the recession, let's get on with it,"" he says, while sitting on the roof terrace of the Sanctum Soho, a 30-room establishment dubbed the rock'n'roll hotel, as much for its ""anything goes"" service philosophy as the pedigree of its owners, which include the co-managers of heavy metal band Iron Maiden. ""We do not recognize there is a credit crunch because we believe you should battle through it,"" Fuller says, adding, ""If you get panicky and scary about things like this, you're no man at all."" Besides, he admits, three years ago when he started working on the concept of an 'alluring haven of hedonism' (as the hotel is described on its Web site), the credit crunch didn't exist. And by the time it hit, it was too late to pull out. ""We wouldn't do anyway,"" Fuller insists, adding ""fortune favors the brave, as they say.""  See images of the rock star hotel » . The former band manager turned entrepreneur, is looking quite the rock star tonight, decked head-to-toe in black while a shiny silver skull stares ominously from his belt buckle. Downstairs, staff are frantically preparing for a launch party that promises to be heavy on champagne, cocktails and celebrities. It's almost like the crunch doesn't exist. This is Fuller's world and he's hoping plenty of people will want to join it. ""In every downturn in the economic climate I think people look for some affordable glamour and escape,"" he says. Fuller also owns and runs the Embassy Hotel, an exclusive nightclub in the upmarket London suburb of Mayfair which he plans to franchise in Dubai, Istanbul and Abu Dhabi. The partners in his new hotel venture ooze rock credential: Iron Maiden co-managers Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor. While Taylor has experience running a restaurant and hotel, ""The Inn on the Green,"" Smallwood's experience in the hotel industry is based on 30 years on the road with Iron Maiden. Last year he stayed in 80 hotels in 40 countries and one of his biggest gripes is returning to his hotel after a gig and finding the bar is closed. ""You want good service, and you want the bars open, and you want good food available,"" he says from the roof terrace equipped with a bar and Jacuzzi he's taken to calling ""my lounge."" Smallwood expects to stay in the hotel once a week and says it will become a London bolt-hole for the band. While non-music types and the tone-deaf are welcome to stay in the hotel, over-enthusiastic groupies are not. ""If you're on the road for three months, you can never escape,"" Smallwood says. ""The fans, some of them, think they have a God-given right, just because they're staying in the same hotel, to put a camera in your face over your cornflakes."" ""The rule here is no autographs and no photographs,"" he says firmly. ""Say Paul Weller is sitting in the corner having a beer, and you go and ask for an autograph or photograph, you will not stay here again."" Along with privacy and a beer at all hours, guests have access to an on-call guitar doctor, a necessity, apparently, if you break a string while strumming in your room. Guests who have inadvertently left their guitar at home can hire one from reception. The rock star concept extends to the room decor. The silver wallpaper and mirrored columns may appear garish in daylight, but at 3 a.m. one suspects they add a touch of glamour. Free standing baths are a bold leap from the bed and the mini bar is well-stocked with champagne. Rod Smallwood is confident the concept will work. ""Recession or no recession, we're talking about 30 rooms in a huge major city. If we can't sell 30 rooms in the depths of recession it means we're useless, and we know we're not."" Mark Fuller says he's selling more than a hotel room. In times of economic crisis the Sanctum Soho offers the chance to forget the mortgage and live like a rock star, if only for a day. ""You can sit in the restaurant and have a hamburger for seven pounds ($10),"" he says. ""The drinks are cheaper than most hotels, and probably cheaper than most nightclubs. The room accommodation runs everywhere from £125 ($255) straight up to £450 ($650). Take your pick. Cut your coat."" I mishear him. ""Cut your coke?"" I ask. ""No, you can't do that!"" he exclaims. ""Musicians are not like that anymore,"" Fuller says. ""The music industry is such now that people release CDs to support tours, not the other way around, so this is a professional state. ""I just don't want to be the hotel at the end of the tour, then I'm in danger,"" he laughs.","Entrepreneur braves recession to open rock'n'roll hotel in London's Soho .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Charging chesty women more for their bras doesn't win a lot of support, British retailer Marks & Spencer acknowledged Friday as it announced an end to the surcharge on its larger lingerie. Marks & Spencer have apologised for charging chesty women more for bras. ""We boobed,"" screamed a full-page Marks & Spencer ad, which appeared in British newspapers Friday. Marks & Spencer gave in to campaigners who argued that the higher prices of the bigger bras was unfair. The retailer charged as much as £2 ($3) more for all sizes DD and up. ""It's true that our fantastic quality larger bras cost more money to make, and we felt it was right to reflect this in the prices we charged,"" the ad said. ""Well, we were wrong."" It follows a nearly year-long campaign by members of the Facebook group Busts 4 Justice. The women behind the site argued other chain retailers didn't charge extra for bigger sizes, so Marks & Spencer shouldn't, either.

"(CNN) -- Former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick arrived at his home in Hampton, Virginia, on Thursday morning. Michael Vick, left, arrives at federal court with attorney Billy Martin in Richmond, Viriginia, in 2007. ""He is happy to be reunited with his family,"" said Chris Garrett, a spokesman for Vick. Vick was released from a federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, on Wednesday. He will serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement in Virginia, his publicist Judy Smith said. Vick is a native of Newport News, Virginia.  Watch a panel discuss his release » . Vick, 28, pleaded guilty in August 2007 to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. He could return to professional football as soon as September if reinstated by the NFL, according to the sports agent who negotiated Vick's 10-year, $140 million contract with the Falcons. Meanwhile, Vick's attorneys have said he will work at a Newport News construction firm after his release and he has also agreed to participate in a documentary for $600,000. Last month, a federal bankruptcy judge denied a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan presented by Vick and urged him to offer another plan. The original plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but he said he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much. Santoro suggested Vick's next plan not call for him to keep two houses and three cars, as did the rejected proposal. In testimony, Vick acknowledged committing a ""heinous"" act and said he should have acted more maturely. He said he has been earning 12 cents an hour as an overnight janitor in prison. His Falcons salary, he said, was between $10 million and $12 million. He acknowledged failing to handle his money well. After his release, Vick will work with the Humane Society of the United States on anti-dogfighting campaigns, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN Tuesday. Vick will work on programs aimed at preventing youths from getting involved in dogfighting, and on programs to assist young people who have already been involved in the blood sport.  Watch more about Vick's dogs » . Pacelle said the Humane Society was approached by Vick's representatives. He said he has traveled to Kansas twice to meet with the former quarterback, and during the second visit, the two discussed how Vick could use his sway over youths to discourage them from involvement in dogfighting, as well as help those who were apprehended in connection with it. Details have not yet been hammered out, Pacelle said, but will be in the next couple of days. iReport.com: Does Vick deserve a second chance? More attention has been paid to dogfighting as a result of Vick's case, Pacelle said.

"(CNET) -- Craigslist's managers have complied with the wishes of most of the state attorneys general who demanded they rid the site of prostitution ads. Craigslist says it has removed prostitution ads, but some issues remain. The Web's dominate classifieds publication replaced its controversial ""erotic"" section with a new ""adult"" category. And where Craigslist once relied on readers to flag dodgy advertisements, the company's employees now review every ad submitted to the adult area before they appear online. Yet, the site has been unable to block every solicitation for sex. Catherine, a self-described sex worker from San Francisco, confirmed for CNET that she successfully posted an ad for her services to the adult section late last week. She wished to remain anonymous, so neither the ad's photo nor text can be included in this story. Regardless, it isn't hard to find questionable ads in Craigslist's new adult section. The most noticeable difference between Craigslist's erotic and adult categories is the photos. In the adult section, the photos are less provocative. Less skin is showing. When it comes to the text, however, the two sections are very similar. Both are packed with ads for massage services. Ads in both areas include descriptions of the masseuse's breast size (""I'm a natural C cup"") and they are often photographed dressed in their underwear. Even if most of these services are legitimate, and only a few are veiled offers of sex in the new adult area, plenty of others make little if any pretense about what they offer. These ads typically include words such as ""busty,"" or ""fantasy girl"" in their descriptions. Often, they feature photos of a woman or man dressed provocatively in their underwear or bathing suit. Some include hourly rates. Clearly, Craigslist faces a significant challenge as it tries to purge prostitution from its Web pages. While it can ban nude photos and overt offers of sex, how can anyone expect the site to outlaw ads featuring photos of bikini-clad women offering phone numbers? One can find racier images in department store ads. The Internet has made it easier for merchants of all kinds to conduct commerce and reach wider audiences. Should anyone be surprised that the sex trade has benefited from this as well. If Craigslist were to disappear tomorrow, does anyone really expect that would curb prostitution? A review of some competing online classifieds shows that while Craigslist has been a popular destination for sex workers, it is by no means the only one. For example, Backpages.com is an online classified publication and Craigslist competitor. The content it produces can also be found on the Web sites of some entertainment and alternative publications in major metropolitan areas, such as New York's Village Voice or San Francisco's SFWeekly. Craigslist is G-rated compared with the photos found in Backpages' adult section. Ads included nude photos while others showed people engaged in sexual intercourse. A common ad would show a bare chested woman asking men to call her at a phone number. In the area of Backpages that services Charleston, S.C., one ad found on Tuesday by CNET featured a photo of a bare-chested woman apparently engaged in masturbation. It must be noted that there was nothing as graphic on Craigslist. This is relevant because Henry McMaster, South Carolina's attorney general, last week threatened Craigslist with a criminal investigation. McMaster hasn't made any similar threats--at least none that has been publicized--against Backpages. Managers at Backpages did not respond to an interview request. In November, Craigslist and 40 state attorneys general, including McMaster, signed an agreement that called for the site to add more safeguards. The classifieds publication followed through and one of the new changes was a new requirement that anyone posting to the erotic section must provide a credit card. All the parties hoped that criminals would be unwilling to provide identification and this would be deterrent. ""Many of the classified and communication services on the Craigslist site provide the public with a valuable service,"" McMaster wrote to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster on May 5. ""However, it appears that the management...has knowingly allowed the site to be used for illegal and unlawful activity after warnings from law enforcement officials and after an agreement with forty state attorneys general."" Since then, Craigslist did away with the erotic section and agreed to review every ad before it appeared, but McMaster was dissatisfied. He posted a note on his site that said the ""Craigslist South Carolina site continues to display advertisements for prostitution and graphic pornographic material. This content was not removed as we requested. We have no alternative but to move forward with criminal investigation and potential prosecution."" This is at best an empty threat, says Matt Zimmerman, a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Communication Decency Act protects Web sites like Craigslist from being held criminally liable for the actions of its users, Zimmerman said, who added that Craigslist has no legal obligation to even review ads before they go online. Had Zimmerman had his way, Craigslist would have never agreed to do the monitoring. Craig Newmark, Craigslist's founder, had earlier gone on national TV and said that Craigslist would not do away with the erotic section. The company's reversal may have led McMaster to believe he could shame Craigslist managers into doing more than what the law required. ""It made life more difficult for Craigslist I think,"" Zimmerman said. ""But I was much more disappointed with (McMaster) than Craigslist,"" Zimmerman said. ""His threats were bogus to begin with and he was wrong to threaten (Craigslist's managers) with jail when the law is very clearly on their side."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor knew she wanted to go into law from an early age. Sonia Sotomayor says the nomination is the ""most humbling honor "" of her life. As a child, she aspired to be like Nancy Drew, the detective in the popular children's mystery series. But at the age of 8, she was diagnosed with diabetes and told she would not be able to pursue that line of work. Sotomayor said it was another fictional character that inspired her next choice. ""I noticed that [defense attorney] Perry Mason was involved in a lot of the same kinds of investigative work that I had been fascinated with reading Nancy Drew, so I decided to become a lawyer,"" Sotomayor told the American Bar Association publication in 2000. ""Once I focused on becoming a lawyer, I never deviated from that goal.""  See Sotomayor's life in photos » . Sotomayor's parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II. Her father worked in a factory and didn't speak English. She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project, not too far from the stadium of her favorite team -- the New York Yankees. Her father died when she was 9, leaving her mother to raise her and her younger brother on her own. Related: Sotomayor well known in sports . Her mother, whom Sotomayor describes as her biggest inspiration, worked six days a week to care for her and her younger brother, and instilled in them the value of an education.  Background on Sotomayor » . Sotomayor later graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and went on to attend Yale law school, where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal. In her three-decade career, she has worked at nearly every level of the judicial system, and on Tuesday she became President Obama's pick to replace retiring Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court.  Watch Sotomayor accept the nomination » . Sotomayor thanked Obama for ""the most humbling honor of my life."" ""I hope that as the Senate and American people learn more about me, they will see that I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences. Today is one of those experiences,"" she said. The 54-year-old judge, if confirmed, would become the first Hispanic to serve on the high court. She would also be the third female named to the Supreme Court, and the second on the current court.  See who's already on the Supreme Court » . Sotomayor is touted by supporters as a justice with bipartisan favor and historic appeal. She currently serves as a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The liberal-leaning justice was named a district judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and was elevated to her current seat by President Clinton. Supporters say her appointment history, along with what they describe as her moderate-liberal views, will give her some bipartisan backing in the Senate. Sotomayor presided over about 450 cases while on the district court. Prior to her judicial appointments, Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes. Robin Kar, who clerked for Sotomayor from 1998 to 1999, described her as a ""warm, extraordinarily kind and caring person.""  Watch Kar recall his work with Sotomayor » . ""She has an amazing story, but she's also just an amazing person,"" he said, adding that she has a knack for getting to know those around her. ""She was the judge who, in the courthouse for example, knew all of the doormen, knew the cafeteria workers, who knew the janitors -- she didn't just know all of the other judges and the politicians. She really went out of her way to get to know everyone and was well loved by everyone."" Conservatives argue Sotomayor has a ""hard-left record"" and believes that judges should consider experiences of women and minorities in their decision-making. They also described her as a ""bully"" who ""abuses lawyers."" Asked about allegations that she tends to be prickly with her colleagues, Kar said, ""I would say no to that. What I would say is that she has a reputation for being prickly on the bench, which is a bit different."" Kar said if attorneys have with a weak argument, ""she's very quick ... and intellectually demanding."" ""They'll have a hard time if they show up in her court without really doing their homework,"" he said. Margarita Rosa, a Princeton classmate of Sotomayor, said she's always known the high court nominee to be ""measured and methodical"" in her decision-making. ""She really looks at the facts and she is, I think, very evenhanded and fair -- but does bring to the table a very valuable understanding of the challenges and experiences, I think, of average people,"" she said. Obama has said he hopes confirmation hearings will be held in July, with the confirmation completed before Congress leaves for the summer.  Sotomayor was confirmed to her current seat by the Senate in 1998, a process that took more than a year. The final vote was 67-29. Though a majority of Senate Republicans opposed her nomination, she did win several key Republican votes that year, which could prove critical in this year's confirmation fight. In 1998, the New York judge won the support of 25 Republicans, including eight senators who still serve. If Sotomayor is able to maintain the support of just a few of those GOP senators this year, Senate Republicans would face an almost impossible task in defeating her nomination, even by filibuster, which requires 40 votes. Currently, Republicans hold 39 senate seats. All 29 votes against her 1998 nomination were from Republicans, 11 of whom still serve.

"(CNN) -- A southwest Illinois man accused of strangling his wife and two young sons appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to murder charges, officials said. Christopher Coleman sits in the back of a police car after his arrest Tuesday in the slayings of his wife and two sons. Christopher Coleman, 32, will remain jailed without bond pending a June 10 preliminary hearing, according to the Monroe County, Illinois, district court clerk's office. He is charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Sheri Coleman, 31, and sons Garett, 11, and Gavin, 9. Their bodies were found May 5 in the bedrooms of the Coleman's two-story home in Columbia, Illinois, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. The three died of strangulation by ligature -- a string, cord or wire -- police said. Coleman was arrested Tuesday at his parents' home in Chester, Illinois. As a police patrol car carrying Coleman arrived at the Monroe County courthouse for Wednesday's hearing, a waiting crowd shouted ""murderer"" and ""baby killer,"" according to video posted on the Web site of CNN affiliate KSDK. Coleman told police he left the house at 5:43 a.m. the day of the deaths and drove to a gym to work out.  Watch report of Coleman's actions after deaths » . ""Shortly thereafter, he started calling his house, realized that nobody was answering and on his way back at around 6:50 a.m. is when he made the phone call to the Columbia Police Department, said Maj. Jeff Connor, commander of the Major Case Squad of Greater St. Louis. Coleman said he was calling the house to make sure the boys were waking up for school, Connor said. Threatening messages were found on the walls inside the home, Connor said, but would not disclose the exact wording. In an article posted on the Major Case Squad's Web site, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported the message said something to the effect of, ""I told you this would happen."" A glove with red spray paint on it was found along Interstate 255, which would have been on Coleman's route to the gym, the newspaper reported. The message in the Coleman home was written in paint of a similar color, the article said. Coleman previously worked in the security department for Joyce Meyer Ministries, an evangelical Christian organization based in suburban St. Louis, said spokesman Roby Walker. Walker told CNN Coleman resigned last week after the two met regarding ""a violation of moral conduct."" He would not elaborate. The Post-Dispatch cited police sources as saying Coleman had more than one romantic rendezvous with a Florida woman, a friend of his wife, during out-of-town ministry trips. Neither Coleman nor his attorneys have commented on that report, the Post-Dispatch said. Police said Tuesday they did not have a motive for the killings. Joyce Meyer Ministries said in a statement Wednesday that it had learned of the charges against Coleman. ""This horrible tragedy has deeply saddened us all and although nothing can compensate for the loss of this beautiful family, our ministry remains fully behind the diligent efforts of the law enforcement community,"" the statement said.","NEW: Illinois man held without bond on three counts of first-degree murder .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As Supreme Court hopeful Sonia Sotomayor breaks ground for Hispanics, she is poised to add an exclamation point to another historic demographic shift: the move to a Catholic court. If confirmed, Sonia Sotomayor would be the sixth Catholic justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Sotomayor was raised Catholic and if she is confirmed, six out of nine, or two-thirds of the justices on the court will be from the faith. Catholics make up about one-quarter of the U.S. population. ""It's most unusual,"" said Barbara Perry, a government professor at Sweetbriar College who was already writing a book about Catholics on the Supreme Court when Sotomayor was named as the next nominee. ""Presidents used to reserve a Catholic seat and a Jewish seat on the Supreme Court,"" Perry told CNN Radio. ""Now we've moved from a Catholic seat on the court to a Catholic court."" Of the 110 people who have served on the Supreme Court, 11 have been Catholic. Five of those justices -- Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts -- are currently on the court. ""It is more than a random selection process that yielded the current five Catholics on the bench,"" Perry said. The five current Catholic justices were appointed by Republican presidents, which Perry notes may be a key reason why so many Catholics have joined the high court in recent years. ""It's their tie to conservative Catholicism which made them agreeable to (Republican) presidents' ideology,"" she said. Perry sees Catholics as swing voters with a base of socially conservative principles, and therefore naturally attractive for Republican presidents. Catholic League President Bill Donohue goes further, hypothesizing that Catholics have conservative credentials on issues such as abortion, without the political baggage of terms such as the ""religious right"" or ""evangelicals."" ""Is it safer to nominate a Catholic as opposed to an evangelical to get votes? I think the answer is decidedly yes,"" Donohue said. Donohue also suggests the vigorous education in Catholic schools during the 20th century produced sharp legal minds. ""I think there might be a certain kind of Catholic edge, so to speak, as a residual property of a Catholic education,"" he said. Roberts, Scalia and Thomas attended Catholic school as children, as did Sotomayor.  Watch more about Sotomayor's personal history » . Underlying causes aside, Perry sees the fast shift as a sign that centuries of American concern about Catholics are over. In 1985, a lone Catholic justice, William J. Brennan, Jr., sat on the court. A generation later, that number is poised to become six. ""What that tells is that in our politics, religion doesn't matter anymore,"" Perry said. Then she added: ""I don't think our politics are ready for an Islamic justice at this point."" The current court is composed of two Jewish members -- Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If Sotomayor joins the bench, Justice John Paul Stevens would be the solitary Protestant on a court once dominated by white Protestant men.  Learn about the other Supreme Court justices » . Court observers wonder what, if anything, six Catholic justices would mean for Supreme Court decisions. The five Catholics currently on the bench concurred in a 2007 decision, Gonzales v. Carhart, which upheld a state ban on late-term abortions. Sotomayor has faced few abortion cases, and no tests on issues such gay rights or the death penalty. However, Donohue expects a Justice Sotomayor to lean more left than her fellow Catholics on the court.  Read about Sotomayor's record » . ""I think she's more reliably liberal,"" Donohue said. Donohue said he still would like to see Sotomayor join the bench. ""Even though I'm a conservative and she is not, there's still a certain way that you do root for the home team,"" he said.","If confirmed, Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be Supreme Court's sixth Catholic .

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- An unopposed former Communist leader was elected Nepal's new prime minister Saturday, ending nearly three weeks of political uncertainty. Madhav Kumar Nepal waves at his supporters at the country's parliament in Kathmandu. Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) was the only person to serve as a candidate for the post after he received backing from more than 20 of the 25 parties in parliament. Nepal, 56, is a former general secretary of the Communist Party, but had resigned after the party made a poor showing last year against another Communist movement. In that vote, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the largest party, with 38 percent of the seats in the 601-member constituent assembly which also functions as parliament. Nepal had been general secretary since 1993 and served as the country's deputy prime minister for nine months in 1995. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Maoist chairman, resigned as prime minister May 4 after the president overturned the Cabinet's decision to sack the army chief. Nepal became a republic last year.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- On the eve of what was to become the biggest sale ever of a Chinese contemporary painting, Trevor Simon wanted to get the word out about ""Execution,"" a painting he had hidden from everybody. The painting had been stored in a  London warehouse for more than a decade after arriving from Hong Kong. ""Not a single person in the world had seen it other than me for more than a decade,"" said the 36-year-old investment banking strategist by phone from London on Thursday. That includes his mother and the woman he loves. Beijing artist Yue Minjun's painting, inspired by the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen Square in 1989, sold for 2.9 million pounds ($5.9 million) Friday night in London. The sale exceeded the 2.15 million pounds ($4.37 million) paid in June for the previous record, Yue's ""The Pope."" Simon remembers seeing the oil painting at Manfred Schoeni's gallery in Hong Kong during the late 1990s and how it fascinated him at first sight. ""As soon as I saw it, my whole self changed,"" he said. ""I realized that this stood for everything that was going on at the time, so I was stunned into silence literally. I saw what was happening in China. I was rising in banking, and I saw an execution of people who were smiling. ""I saw that was what was going on in banking."" Schoeni and Simon were already on friendly terms, and Schoeni had wanted to show him ""Execution,"" which had been covered up. But when Simon insisted he wanted the painting, he recalled Schoeni telling him it wasn't going anywhere and was not for sale. But Simon said he would not leave and remembered saying: "" 'Fine, have a drink with me.' And maybe I loosened his head a bit. After a couple hours, I struck a deal."" A junior investment banker in his 20s at the time, Simon would spend $250,000 Hong Kong dollars ($32,200), or two-thirds of his annual salary, on ""Execution."" The painting reflected what he felt was going on in the world in which he worked: a soulless place. ""While you can apply a good mind, the job eats your life. You spend 14 hours in the markets. A week in Paris, a week in London running around. No life. My girlfriend didn't want to be with me: 'I can't have you.'"" She'd leave him and has since become engaged to someone else, he said. ""It was not only an image of an execution of characters in front of the walls of Tiananmen, but an execution of me,"" he said, describing himself as ""committed to this painting."" Under the terms of the deal he struck with Schoeni, the painting was to be ""out of sight for five years"" and shipped to London, Simon explained. He described the painting -- at 3 meters (10 feet) wide and 1.5 meters (5 feet) high -- as ""monumental,"" ""physical,"" and ""like a wall."" He put ""Execution"" in a box, shipped it out of Hong Kong to London. ""And it hasn't moved since that day. It's in a crusty warehouse behind a main road."" He finds a key distinction between ""Execution"" and Francisco de Goya's ""The Third of May, 1808: The Execution of the Defenders of Madrid"" and Edouard Manet's ""The Execution of the Emperor Maximilien of Mexico."" In those, he said, ""that's murder, true assassination of a political figure. But here [with ""Execution""], it's far more potent. Because they're killed by culture."" The laughing was a ""response to unimaginable persecution,"" he said. ""You don't know what the hell else to do. You're nervous. You're not laughing, 'Ha ha hee hee.'"" As for the underwear, Simon said, ""You're stripped down, you're defenseless. Even worse, you're being shot with cultural forces, not bullets."" And while the man on the far right of Manet's painting cocks the gun and delivers the coup de grace, the figure in ""Execution"" has a similar role, said Simon. ""He's wearing a generic T-shirt -- the guy who's delivering the last shot to be delivered into the heartland of Chinese heritage."" Yue's painting was in keeping with ""cynical realism,"" the term coined by art critic Li Xianting to describe post-Tiananmen artists disillusioned by and critical of Chinese society, Simon said. When asked if he, as a young 20-something, ever harbored doubts or questioned his sanity about dishing out a large portion of his salary for this work, Simon replied: ""No, no, no, no. I knew. I stood there. You just know. You just absolutely know beyond all doubt that the theme is something special. ""This art was a representation of all the ambition and all the anxiety that had been held back behind the Chinese wall and was now allowed to live, allowed to go free. ""I knew without a millionth of a doubt that that was the story of China on canvas."" Simon said he would probably cry if he and Yue met. ""He's an immensely brave man, anyone who paints like this. None of his paintings are as politically dangerous as this."" Simon left the painting in a box in the warehouse and never brought it out or hung it up, despite having other work elsewhere in his house. For one thing, Schoeni was murdered in 2004 in the Philippines. Simon felt that it was because Schoeni was involved in championing the works of people from ""repressive"" countries. The painting became a mental crutch for him. He determined that he would walk out on the most important job he could think of in investment banking, one that earned him more than a million dollars a year. ""The painting helped me leave the job because I could see a country being executed and surviving, and so maybe I could too,"" he said in a follow-up email. Simon had left Hong Kong for ""the lion's den,"" as he put it, in London, where he felt further ""executed by the politics and chaos one step below the top rung of the bank."" The very top was where the more rational and humanity prevailed, he said. ""All the rest is scratching and positioning and seldom is the best thing done."" He'd leave his job. That was five years ago, and while he is still involved in finance, he works on his own now, he said. Selling the painting brings Simon full circle to being ""un-Executed,"" he said. Yue's got a new museum and is being recognized by the Chinese government. ""He's no longer repressed by China. And I'm no longer repressed by commercial ambition. It's about doing it the right way,"" Simon said. ""The value of this piece is not the dollar value. It's lovely to have that extra money. But the real value, should I die tomorrow morning, has already been placed in my heart,"" he said. ""I'm not laughing at being shot at. What I'm most proud of is the courage to live. ""God gave me talents. I'm going to use them for good, not for money. Not for trading."" But first, he plans to get the girl back.","Beijing artist Yue Minjun's ""Execution"" sold for record 2.9 million pounds ($5.9M)

"Editor's note: Michael A. Olivas is the William B. Bates Distinguished Chair in Law at the University of Houston Law Center and director of the university's Institute for Higher Education Law and Governance. He is the editor of ""Colored Men And Hombres Aquí: Hernandez V. Texas and the Emergence of Mexican American Lawyering,"" and is a member of the board of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Michael Olivas says Sonia Sotomayor's nomination affirms that Latinos matter in America. (CNN) -- I recently saw an old episode of ""West Wing,"" where Edward James Olmos, playing a fictional Puerto Rican federal judge, was nominated to become the first Latino on the U.S. Supreme Court. I cried, thinking how remote this possibility seemed, yet how close. Now that Judge Sonia Sotomayor has been nominated by President Barack Obama to the Court, that episode finally rings true. When I heard the news, I wept, for the long-overdue acknowledgement that Latinos matter. Judge Sotomayor's life and legal career are arcs possible only in this country: a hardscrabble life in a south Bronx housing project, educational opportunities made possible by her own intelligence and hard work, and a legal career devoted to public service. When she assumes her position on the bench in October, no other justice will have had the depth of legal experience she holds, and none will have served as a trial judge. The sum of her life is exactly what we should look for on this court: excellent academic credentials, an accomplished legal career in private and government practice, and appointments to federal benches by Republican and Democrat presidents. Her decisions have been well-reasoned and well-written, and she will ably take her place on the Supreme Court bench. The search for a justice with ""empathy"" is no less coded than is the traditional search for ""judicial temperament"" and a person who will ""judge, not legislate."" All nominees have the requisite merit badges, as does Judge Sotomayor. And to make their way to such a short list, all have the combination of personal and professional lives that warrant their consideration. What Sonia Sotomayor will have, as few other candidates, is the additional weight of historical expectations and the hopes of Latinos. In today's culture, Latinos are marginalized and demonized and feared. In Judge Sotomayor's New York, roving gangs of thugs go ""beaner hunting,"" looking to harm undocumented Mexicans. Such racial hatred knows no nuance, as one such mob killed a permanent resident Ecuadorian, thinking him to be Mexican. Vigilantes along the Mexican border have taken the law of enforcement into their own hands. In cultural programming, this community is described as either lazy and shiftless, or stealing jobs from real Americans. They are typecast as drogeros or maids, long characterized as banditos or greasers. The racial rhetoric against Latinos has been tolerated for too long on cable television news and in political and polite discourse. I will be carefully watching the confirmation hearings for the coded political messages, knowing that Justice-elect Sotomayor's many merits will ultimately win her confirmation. But also watching will be little girls in a south Bronx housing project, in the valley of South Texas, and in rural New Mexico. Her service on our country's highest court will be the evidence that they, too, have reason to hope and to achieve. All of this country's citizens should realize that it is not just Latinos' dreams being realized, but our collective accomplishment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Olivas.","Michael Olivas: Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination is a historic moment .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Angered by what he perceived as the systemic discrimination of the minority Tamils by successive Sri Lankan governments, 18-year-old Velupillai Prabhakaran, armed with just a revolver, set out in 1972 to right the perceived wrongs by forming a militant group. Sri Lanka's defense ministry says this handout photo shows troops with a captured Tamil Tiger craft. That group eventually morphed into the Tamil Tigers, who have engaged in a brutal 25-year insurgency for an independent Tamil state that has left more than 70,000 dead. Along the way, the group has been declared a terrorist organization in 32 countries, pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the suicide belt. It was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so. Over the weekend, the militants offered to ""silence"" their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks, usurping them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country, and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land.  Watch more on the possible end to the conflict » . On Monday afternoon, the Sri Lankan government said it had killed Prabhakaran. If the rebels now follow through on their announcement, the action will potentially mark the end of the longest-running civil war in Asia. Who are the Tamils? The Tamils are an ethnic group that makes up about 12 percent of Sri Lanka's population of about 20 million. They mostly dominate the northern and eastern part of the country. Tamils are mostly Hindu and speak Tamil. That sets them apart from Sri Lanka's majority group, the Sinhalese, who make up 74 percent of the population. They are Buddhists and speak Sinhala. The tension between the two ethnic groups date to the British colonization of the country -- an island in the Indian Ocean, south of India. At the time, the country was known as Ceylon. Many Sri Lankans regarded the Tamils as British collaborators and resented the preferential treatment they received. The tables turned when the country achieved independence in 1948 and the Sinhalese majority dominated government. It was the Tamils then who claimed they were being discriminated against in politics, employment and education. By the 1970s Tamil politicians were demanding a separate Tamil state. It would be called Tamil Eelam. In this climate Prabhakaran emerged with his militant group, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Who is Prabhakaran? Prabhakaran operated from a secret jungle base in the northeastern part of the country, granting few media interviews and remaining an elusive figure to even many Tigers. He was reputed to wear a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow rather than risk capture. And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops. As a result, few Tigers have been captured alive. To Prabhakaran's supporters he was a hero fighting for the rights of his people. The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with disregard for civilian casualties. He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime. In 1975, three years after forming his group, Prabhakaran was accused of fatally shooting the mayor of Jaffna, his birthplace. Prabhakaran was also accused of masterminding the killing of then-Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later, a Tigers' suicide bomber, allegedly acting under Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally.  Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka » . Who are the Tamil Tigers? The Tigers reportedly number about 10,000, recruited from villagers in Tamil-dominated areas and unemployed Tamil youths who think they were passed over for jobs because of their ethnicity. Their armed struggle began in July 1983 when the Tigers killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers. It led to, what was until then, the largest outburst of violence in the island's history. Hundreds of Tamils were killed, thousands left homeless and more than 100,000 fled to south India. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Tigers have -- until now -- shown no signs of being overpowered by the Sri Lankan military. The Tigers are infamous for suicide bombings, with men and women strapping on suicide vests for more than 200 attacks against Sri Lankan citizens and dozens of high-profile political leaders. In addition to perpetrating the attacks that killed Gandhi and Premadasa, the rebels have carried out the assassinations of two lawmakers and four ministers. A suicide bomber targeted Sri Lankan then-President Chandrika Kumaratunga in December 1999 while she was campaigning for re-election. She was wounded but survived. The Tigers, however, have refrained from targeting Western tourists out of fear that foreign governments would crack down on Tamil expatriates who raise money for them abroad, the U.S. State Department said. Have there been peace talks? Periodically fighting has briefly halted because of a handful of peace agreements. By February 2002 the Tigers had dropped their demands for a separate homeland in exchange for a power-sharing deal with the government. Norway and some other countries agreed to monitor the ceasefire. A year later the rebels dropped out of the negotiations, saying they were being marginalized. They launched a suicide bombing campaign soon after. What led to renewed fighting? In January 2008 the Sri Lankan government announced it was annulling the nearly six-year-old truce with the rebels, declaring that it would crush the rebels. The fighting intensified with security forces driving the rebels from their strongholds in the east and north of the country. The government asked the rebels to lay down arms; the rebels vowed to continue. Caught in the crossfire were civilians, thousands of whom were displaced and hundreds killed. International aid groups expressed concern that both the government and the rebels disregarded civilian safety even in no-fire zones and hospitals. Both sides blamed the other for civilian casualties and exaggerated accounts of their victories. With journalists not allowed into the battle zones, their claims could not be independently confirmed. On Sunday, the Tigers posted an ""urgent statement"" on a pro-rebel Web site, saying the battle had reached ""its bitter end."" ""We have decided to silence our guns,"" the statement said. Euphoria gripped the war-wracked nation. And Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa readied to announce to Tuesday that military operations had ended. But one last order of business awaited: The capture, dead or alive, of Prabhakaran. In the past, the Tigers have emerged from near-defeat. But if Prabhakaran's death is confirmed, the government is optimistic that it can write off the Tigers. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report, which includes information from various sources. They include the U.S. State Department, the FBI, Interpol, Human Rights Watch, the Council on Foreign Relations, the CIA Factbook, and previous CNN reports.","25-year long insurgency has killed more than 70,000 people .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Thousands of Americans learn a painful lesson in banking every day: Waiting for a check to clear and then getting access to the money from a bank doesn't mean the check has really cleared. When Harry Smith, of New York, responded to an ad on Craigslist for an office assistant, a woman e-mailed him and said her British company was starting to sell its product in the United States, but was having trouble with dealing with checks from customers. Smith said the woman needed someone to collect the checks and then send the money to her company. It was a commission job -- deposit the checks, wait for the funds to become available at his bank, then send cash to her, minus 10 percent for Smith. After Smith checked out what seemed like a legitimate company on the Internet, he started receiving checks totaling several thousand dollars and deposited them in his account. When his bank released the funds, he sent cash to an address outside the country. But after a few weeks, Smith's bank notified him the checks he had deposited had actually been returned, and that he owed the bank all the money he had withdrawn. Smith has not heard from his business partner since and doesn't even know who she really is. He still owes his bank money, is unemployed and doesn't know what action the bank might take against him. What happened to Smith is one example of a wide range of fake check scams carried out in the United States every year. A Consumer Federation of America survey estimates that 1.3 million Americans have been the victim of a fake check scam, with an average loss of $3,000 to $4,000 per consumer. The most common scams are fake sweepstakes or lotteries, phony government sponsored grants and fraudulent work-at-home opportunities, the survey says. The scams follow the pattern of the so-called Nigerian Internet scams, which often involve accepting transfers of money that become obviously phony when it's too late. On Wednesday, the Consumer Federation launched a campaign to combat check scams. Many consumers don't know they are responsible if they deposit a bad check, said Susan Grant, the federation's director of consumer protection. Grant said its survey shows an alarming level of misinformation among consumers, and the problem includes money orders and cashier's checks. Fifty-nine percent of respondents in the survey incorrectly thought that, when you deposit a check or money order, your bank confirms it is good before allowing you to withdraw the money. That number goes up to 70 percent among adults age 18 to 24. More than 40 percent of those surveyed also incorrectly think that the person who gave you the bad check must pay back the bank. American consumers are mostly unfamiliar with the time needed to process checks and money orders, say consumer watchdogs. Government banking rules mandate that money from deposits become available within one to five days. However, it can take weeks, especially with foreign checks or money orders, for the originating institutions to get the checks or money orders back and determine that they are counterfeit. When that happens, scam victims are in for a rude surprise. Publishers Clearing House, which runs legitimate sweepstakes, warns consumers that scammers might claim that you are being given an advance on a prize, but that some fee, tax or other payment needs to be sent before you get the jackpot. That's the heart of the scam, and it's something that a real sweepstakes will never ask for, say legitimate companies. Consumer protection groups, state attorney generals, the Federal Trade Commission and government bank regulators warn consumers that the number of fake checks, money orders and even cashier's checks being used to scam victims is increasing. The bottom line: ""There's no legitimate reason why anyone who wants to give you a check or money order for something would ever ask you to send money anywhere in return. It's as simple as that,"" said Grant of the Consumer Federation of America. Smith said he suspected that his part-time job was not on the up-and-up, but didn't know about fake check scams. He's not sure how he will pay back his bank, but hopes his story will help keep other people from becoming victims. The Consumer Federation of America's tips against fake check scams: . -- Never agree to pay to claim a prize. -- Never agree to pay for grants from the government or foundations. -- Never agree to cash checks and send the money somewhere as part of a job working from home. -- Never agree to wire money to anyone you have not met in person and known for a long time. -- If it seems suspicious, consult your state or local consumer protection agency, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service or another trusted source. -- Remember that there is no legitimate reason why anyone who wants to give you a check or money order would ask you to send money anywhere in return.","More than 1 million Americans have been victim of fake check scams, study finds .

"YANGON, Myanmar (CNN) -- Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the stand for the first time Tuesday and told a Myanmar court that she did not violate her house arrest when she offered temporary shelter to an American man who swam to her lakeside home. People of Myanmar living in Japan protest for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi on May 24, 2009 in Tokyo, Japan. ""She was very confident, very firm, very clear,"" said Mark Canning, the British ambassador to Myanmar, who was among diplomats and journalists allowed to watch the proceedings. ""In a strange way, she commanded the courtroom,"" he said. Suu Kyi, who is being tried on subversion charges, said she did not learn immediately that John William Yettaw swam nearly two miles and snuck into her crumbling, colonial-era bungalow on May 3. She was told about the visitor the next day by one of two housekeepers who are her sole companions in the heavily guarded residence, where she was under house arrest. Suu Kyi's two helpers are also on trial, as is Yettaw. ""I didn't know,"" she said. ""I was upstairs."" Under questioning by a judge for half an hour, Suu Kyi said she provided Yettaw food but allowed him only to ""stay temporarily."" Yettaw left late May 5, she said. ""He walked to the lakeside. But I don't know which way he went, because it was very dark,"" Suu Kyi said. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate also acknowledged that Yettaw, a 53-year-old former military serviceman from Falcon, Missouri, had visited her once before last November. ""Did you report to the authority about his arrival?"" the judge asked. ""No,"" she replied. Suu Kyi had earlier told supporters that she did not tell authorities about the latest intrusion because she didn't want Yettaw or anyone else to get in trouble. But it is this silence that the Myanmar's military junta is trying her for. The government said Yettaw's presence violated the conditions of Suu Kyi's house arrest. The country's regime rarely allows Suu Kyi any visitors, and foreigners are not allowed overnight stays in local households without government permission. Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 13 of the past 19 years -- a confinement the military junta has regularly extended.  Watch the U.N. secretary general explain what he is doing for Suu Kyi » . Her latest round of home detention -- after five years of confinement -- expires Wednesday, according to her supporters at home and abroad. Last week, the military began prosecuting Suu Kyi on allegations of subversion at a prison compound near Yangon. Her supporters say the move is meant to keep her confined even longer -- beyond the general elections that the junta has scheduled for next year. If convicted, Suu Kyi, 63, could be sentenced to three to five years in prison. Before the proceedings got under way at the Insean Prison compound Tuesday, the junta said Suu Kyi's house arrest did not expire for six more months. And though the government said it considered releasing her at the end of the term, it said it had no choice but to try her after she met with Yettaw. ""As Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of Gen. Aung San, the leader of our country, we were deeply thinking whether to extend her detention or not,"" Police Brigadier General Myint Thein told reporters Tuesday. ""Unfortunately, a U.S. citizen entered her house for two days. She allowed and made conversation with him, gave him food. ""These kind of actions broke the law,"" he added. ""This is why we have no way but to open a case. And we are very sad about this case."" Gen. Aung San played an instrumental role in bringing about the country's independence from British colonial rule. He was assassinated in 1947 and is still revered in Myanmar. Suu Kyi's lawyers rejected the junta's explanation, saying the United Nations had already deemed the opposition leader's continuing detention unlawful under Myanmar's state protection laws. ""The U.N. has said her house arrest expired a year ago,"" said Jared Genser, her U.S.-based lawyer. ""They are out of time, and they cannot detain her any longer under their own law."" Thein told reporters that the pro-democracy advocate had actually been under house arrest for four-and-a-half years. The official said Suu Kyi's house arrest officially went into effect on November 28, 2004. That gives the government six more months to restrict her movement, he said. Genser countered the government's account, citing the conclusion of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The law is unclear whether detention begins from the time a person is arrested or when a detention order is issued, the council said. ""This would suggest an interpretation that you start counting from the day you begin to detain her,"" Genser said. In Suu Kyi's case, she was put under house arrest in May 2003. ""You can't issue an order months later and use that as your starting point. That creates an unfair period of detention,"" he said. After Suu Kyi's testimony Tuesday, the court asked the diplomats and journalists to leave. It denied a defense request to consult with Suu Kyi privately. The court then questioned Yettaw. He is charged with violating immigration laws and trespassing. The charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. A lawyer selected by the U.S. Embassy is representing him. According to Yettaw's testimony in court Friday, he made the unauthorized trip because he had a vision that Suu Kyi would be assassinated and he wanted to warn her. He muttered to himself during the proceedings, including utterances that Suu Kyi is innocent, said Nyan Win, spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. Suu Kyi's prosecution has prompted international criticism, with nine Nobel laureates -- including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa -- calling it a ""mockery."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the charges against Suu Kyi ""baseless"" and accused the junta of ""continuing resistance to a free and open electoral process."" The Nobel laureate has been the face of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement and the focus of a global campaign to free her. Her party won over 80 percent of the legislative seats in 1990. But she was disqualified from serving because of her house arrest, and the military junta ignored the results. The government has said next year's scheduled elections will reintroduce democracy in Myanmar. But its plan includes a clause that forbids citizens who bore children with foreigners from running for office. That makes Suu Kyi ineligible. She married a British man and has two sons with him. CNN's Kocha Olarn in Bangkok, Thailand, and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","Junta says Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest does not expire for six more months .

"KEY WEST, Florida (CNN)  -- The USNS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a retired U.S. Navy warship, embarked on a sedentary new career Wednesday on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The USNS Vandenberg was intentionally sunk Wednesday to create an artificial reef for marine life. The decommissioned warship was scuttled in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary between 10:20 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. ET to become the world's second-largest artificial coral reef. The 17,250-ton ship sank in less than two minutes, said Andy Newman, spokesman for the Florida Keys Tourism Council. It is resting about 140 feet below the surface, but much of its bulk is only 40 to 70 feet below the surface. ""It went down like a rock,"" he told CNN. ""Everything looked very, very smooth."" About 300 boats positioned themselves as close as possible to the site, and cheers went up when the Vandenberg slipped beneath the water seven miles south of Key West, the spokesman said.  Watch the Vandenberg sink » . Newman, who was circling in a helicopter above the 522-foot-long ship, said the Vandenberg appeared to rest in a level position on the Gulf floor. Divers were to assess its position Wednesday. Authorities said once final assessments of the ship are made, divers can begin exploring. The goal of the $8.6 million project is to divert fishing and diving pressure away from natural reefs, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The commission ""estimates that the vessel's life span of at least 100 years will contribute stable, long-term habitat for scores of marine fish species, and provide exceptional diving and fishing opportunities for Florida residents and visitors,"" its Web site says. To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said. Explosive charges were embedded in the bilge area below the water. The explosives detonated inside the hull, blowing outward. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that the Vandenberg artificial reef will result in an annual increase of about $7.5 million in expenditures in the economy of Monroe County, which includes Key West. Sinkthevandenberg.com -- a joint effort by Artificial Reefs of the Keys and Valeo Films -- had offered a live, online stream of the event, but the system apparently was overloaded, making the site inaccessible. The Vandenberg was built at the Kaiser shipyard in Richmond, California, in 1943. It was commissioned as a World War II troop transport ship. After Japan surrendered, the Vandenberg was the first Navy ship to return to New York Harbor. During the 1950s the ship was used to transport refugees from Europe and Australia to America. In the 1960s the Air Force used the Vandenberg to track missiles. It also was used to track rockets and early space shuttle launches. The ship was decommissioned in 1986 and was anchored with more than 25 other mothballed ships in Norfolk, Virginia. The Vandenberg was towed to Key West last month. The Vandenberg was chosen from among 400 decommissioned military vessels mainly based on appearance: ""her topside structure, her smooth, interesting hull lines, big girth and her starring role in a motion picture,"" Newman said. The ship was featured in the 1999 movie ""Virus,"" starring Donald Sutherland and Jamie Lee Curtis. Four men who had served on the Vandenberg traveled to Key West to see the ship go to its final resting place. Patrick Utecht worked for more than 20 years as a civilian contractor on the Vandenberg when it was used for missile and radar tracking and data collection. When he heard about its future as part of an artificial reef, Utecht said, ""My feeling was one of elation."" ""I can say that many of us [crew members] were thrilled that where she was going, she would keep her name and place in history."" ""I think it's a far better use of her than being cut up,"" he added. The largest ship ever scuttled to create an artificial reef was the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Oriskany, which sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast in 2006, according to the U.S. Navy. The former warship slipped under the water about 24 miles south of Pensacola, Florida, the Navy says on its Web site. The Oriskany was 888 feet long, and weighed 32,000 tons. It sank in water about 212 feet deep.","A decommissioned U.S. Navy warship was intentionally sunk off the Florida Keys .

"FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky (CNN) -- The 101st Airborne's senior commander in effect ordered his soldiers Wednesday not to commit suicide, a plea that came after 11 suicides since January 1, two of them in the past week. An Army honor guard stands ready to fire a salute at Fort Campbell. ""If you don't remember anything else I say in the next five or 10 minutes, remember this -- suicidal behavior in the 101st on Fort Campbell is bad,"" Brig. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend told his forces. ""It's bad for soldiers, it's bad for families, bad for your units, bad for this division and our army and our country and it's got to stop now. Suicides on Fort Campbell have to stop now."" Fort Campbell's suicide rate, the highest in the Army, ""is not a good statistic,"" he said in remarks to one of four divisions he addressed during the day. After nearly one soldier per week committed suicide at the post between January and mid-March, the Army instituted a suicide prevention program that ""seemed to be having good effects"" until last week, when two more suicides occurred, he said. ""Suicide is a permanent solution to what is only a temporary problem,"" Townsend said. ""Screaming Eagles don't quit. No matter how bad your problem seems today, trust me, it's not the end of the world. It will be better tomorrow. Don't take away your tomorrow."" He urged anyone feeling hopeless or suicidal to ""tell somebody."" ""You wouldn't hesitate to seek medical attention for a physical injury or wound; don't hesitate to seek medical attention for a psychological injury."" Townsend exhorted any soldier who suspects that a fellow soldier may be feeling suicidal to act -- first by asking how the soldier feels, then by escorting him or her to help. ""Do not wait,"" he said. Soldiers can turn to their leaders, chaplains, medics, social workers, teammates, family and friends, he said. ""Don't let yourself, your buddies or your families down,"" he said, ending his comments by repeating, ""This has got to stop, soldiers. It's got to stop now. Have a great week."" But Townsend's message -- called a Second Suicide Stand-Down event -- is likely to be ineffective, said Dr. Mark Kaplan, a professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon, who has researched veterans' suicide and served last year on a Veterans Administration blue-ribbon panel on suicide risk. ""It sounds like an order,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I'm not sure that a command like this is going to alter the course of somebody who is on a trajectory of self-harm."" He suggested the Army might want to adopt the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs model. ""They're dealing with a comparable problem with a similar population,"" Kaplan said. ""They have infused more sensitivity to their approach to suicide prevention as opposed to this. This is like any other order."" The military culture attaches a stigma to mental illness that needs to be reduced, he said. Soldiers who acknowledge they are considering suicide can suffer severe repercussions, such as losing opportunities for promotion and access to firearms, he said. If the Army is serious about addressing the problem, it needs to address the stressors common to soldiers, including financial problems, marital problems, frequency of deployments, length of deployments, deployments to hostile environments, exposure to extreme stress and service-related injuries, he said. The role of alcohol too must be addressed if the rate of suicide is to be lowered, he said. ""More often than not, these are individuals who'll get liquored up, so to speak, and have access to a gun and die from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" Kaplan said. Bill Lichtenstein, who serves on the board of the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, the advisory council of the Center for the Advancement of Children's Mental Health at Columbia University, and on the advisory board of Families for Depression Awareness, was equally unimpressed with Townsend's tack. ""It's the equivalent of 'Just Say No' to prevent drug abuse,' "" he told CNN in a telephone interview. Screening techniques that involve a series of questions are available to identify people at risk for suicide, he said. ""Prominent among them, if not the most important question is: Have you made a plan for suicide? Using a simple battery of questions, you can suss out people who might be at risk, which is far more important than telling somebody, 'Don't take your life,' "" Lichtenstein said. The problem is not limited to Fort Campbell. The Army has reported 64 potential active-duty suicides this year; 35 have been confirmed as suicides, and 29 are pending determination of manner of death.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- As General Motors heads toward insolvency, the company that was once the biggest on the planet is still riding high in the world's most populous country. China is one bright spot in GM's dismal fortunes, but U.S. consumer activists have raised concerns. As the storied American company prepares to financially dismantle its operations between good and poor performing assets, GM China is becoming the crown jewel in the company's operations. ""If there's a good GM and a bad GM, China is definitely going to be in the good GM side,"" said Michael Dunne, an auto analyst and managing director of J.D. Power and Associates China. But the company's build-up in China is raising concern for U.S. consumer advocates and members of the U.S. Congress. Of particular concern are plans to build cars for the U.S. market in China after thousands of GM workers were laid off at U.S. plants. ""Do we really want the United States of America to export its auto industry paid for by the taxpayer, and un-employ workers to a dictatorship to a country like China?"" said consumer advocate Ralph Nader. ""Where's our self-respect as a nation?"" Adds U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio: ""That cannot be a part of their restructuring of this company. Their business plan cannot include more outsourcing of jobs while taking taxpayer money."" Industry analysts say the decision is a simple matter of dollars and cents: GM is now the third-biggest car manufacturer in China, which has recently overtaken the U.S. as the world's largest car market. ""Our business is run as separate joint-ventures here in China in partnership with SAIC ... so we're profitable, we fund our own investment and we would be largely independent of any action that took place in the US,"" said Kevin Wale, president and managing director of GM China. ""It seems as though they have enough going on out here that they will remain insulated from the bankruptcy back home,"" adds Dunne. ""I see GM weathering the storm in Asia and holding on to what they've accomplished here and being able to ride it out here.""

"(CNN)  -- A history of childhood abuse and use of a provocative online identity increase the risk that girls will be victimized by someone they meet on the Internet, according to a study appearing in the June issue of Pediatrics. A study in Pediatrics sought to identify which risk factors are linked to Internet-initiated victimization of girls. While highlighting the dangers that exist for adolescent girls, the study's authors also offer a word to parents: You can lessen the risks to your children by monitoring their Internet use. The authors sought to identify risk factors connected to increased rates of Internet-initiated victimization of girls. They also wanted to find out whether abuse victims showed increased vulnerability to online victimization. They found that girls are more likely to experience online sexual advances or have offline encounters if they have previously been abused or have a provocative avatar, which is a digital image meant to represent the user online. Those two factors pose a greater risk to adolescents than perhaps more traditionally considered risks, such as Internet naivete and sexual innocence, the study says. The authors say many Internet-initiated sex crimes originate on social networking sites, which require users to create online identities. Some sites, such as Second Life, require users to create a character to represent them in the virtual world. The program presents users with hundreds of possibilities spanning all shapes and sizes; users can choose anything from a fully dressed persona to a scantily clad one. They also can select features such as hair color and figure. Other sites, such as MySpace and Facebook, allow self-descriptions and photographs. But even there, users can choose what to post, and those identities can shape behavior and interaction online, the study says. ""The extent to which provocative self-presentations ... translate into increased online advances or offline encounters is unknown, but it is plausible that these types of presentations constitute an initial invitation for exploitation and a familiar avenue by which sexual advances are initiated,"" the study says. The study's lead author was Jennie G. Noll of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio. The report appears in Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Noll and her co-authors cite the Proteus effect, or the idea that the presentation of oneself can affect the behavior of the presenter and the receiver. ""Self-presentations can change the way Internet users interact in a manner that increases the risk for online sexual advances,"" they say. The study looked at 104 abused and 69 non-abused girls ages 14 to 17. Abused adolescents -- who had suffered neglect, physical abuse or sexual abuse -- were recruited from child protective agencies, the authors said. Of the girls studied, 54 percent were white and 46 percent were minorities, of which 82 percent were black and 18 percent were mixed-race, the authors say. The authors held a laboratory session in which they asked the girls to create avatars on a program designed to mimic a popular social networking site, which the authors did not name in the study. Girls could choose bust and hip size, clothing type, visible navel piercings and skin, eye and hair colors. Girls were given a range of choices that allowed for a more provocative or conservative avatar. Participants were also asked to rate how many times they had had online sexual advances, which were described as ""explicit sexual chatting in virtual worlds,"" and how many times they had met someone in person after meeting first online. The authors say 40 percent of the girls reported experiencing sexual advances online, and 26 percent reported meeting someone offline after getting to know the person on the Internet. Abused girls were much more likely to have experienced both, the authors found. ""Results indicated that abuse status was significantly related to online sexual advances, which were, in turn, related to offline, in-person encounters,"" the study says. The authors say there was no direct link between abuse and offline encounters, but that a history of abuse puts girls at greater risk. Looking at the girls' avatar choices, the authors found that girls who present themselves provocatively in body and clothing choices are more likely to have had online sexual advances. That risk is tied not just to an avatar, but to the overall image a girl projects online, they say. On sites that don't use avatars, such as MySpace or Facebook, simply compiling suggestive photographs or narrative descriptions can increase girls' vulnerability, they say. ""Those adolescents who may be unaware of how their appearance might be perceived may not, from a developmental perspective, possess the social sophistication necessary to field and ward off sexual advances in ways that protect them from sexually explicit suggestions,"" the study says. ""This may be a particularly important lesson to convey to female adolescents who are especially vulnerable to exploitation and victimization, such as those who have been victims of childhood abuse,"" it says. One significant factor that helped decrease the risk to girls was the presence and influence of caregivers, the authors found. They urge parents to be aware of how their adolescent girls present themselves on the Internet and be aware that provocative self-presentation might have implications for sexual solicitation. ""Caregiver presence was associated with significantly fewer reports by adolescents of online solicitations,"" the study says. ""As such, the importance of parental monitoring of adolescent Internet use cannot be understated.""","Study in June issue of Pediatrics identifies risk factors from Internet predators .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Usually, when characters in a movie are one-dimensional, that's not a good thing. But in ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,"" the waxworks figures who come to life after sundown aren't crassly sketchy or dramatically lacking. They're one-dimensional, all right, but knowingly, delightfully so. Ben Stiller and Amy Adams size up a bobble-head Albert Einstein in the ""Night at the Museum"" sequel. Even at their most pop-up brash, they're true to the way that kids see history. They're like characters out of a cool yet innocent mischief-at-midnight children's book -- a ""Where the Wild Things Are"" of global story-time kitsch. And they give you a lift. The movie, make no mistake, is clownishly silly, a lark as light as balsa wood. If anything, though, it's a faster, wittier spin on the formula of its predecessor. Released in 2006, ""Night at the Museum"" was a family popcorn extravaganza that touched a chord even its producers may not have anticipated. In the sequel, Ben Stiller, as the former night guard Larry Daley (he's now a successful entrepreneur ... of flashlights!), spends one long night infiltrating the galleries of the Smithsonian Institution, where he attempts to rescue the exhibits he first got to know at the American Museum of Natural History. (He's trying to get his hands on the magical Egyptian tablet that brings them to life.) The T.rex, the capuchin monkeys, Attila the Hun -- all have been shipped to the archives of the Smithsonian. And all are as feisty as ever. But ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" tilts away from the zoological. The film is a history-of-the-world burlesque in which such drolly self-centered icons as General Custer (Bill Hader), Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest), and Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) -- a made-up pharoah who lisps with the enthusiasm of Boris Karloff on his own reality show -- collide happily with a living army of Albert Einstein bobblehead dolls, plus stone-carved angels who sing ""More Than a Woman"" and ""The Thinker"" come to life as a Brooklyn deadbeat. This is what you call a wholesome kiddie movie on drugs. It all works because Stiller, with his eager-to-please anxiety and his incredulous double takes, is the perfect addled straight man for a hellzapoppin history show. And it works because Amy Adams, as Amelia Earhart, has the breathless, daffy-sexy vivacity of a '30s screwball heroine, her eyes lit with fire, her delivery as sharp as cut glass as she rat-a-tats out lines like ""You haven't been able to take your cheaters off my chassis since we met!""

"Editor's note: Ted Epperly, M.D., a family physician in Boise, Idaho, is president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, which represents more than 93,000 physicians and medical students nationwide. He spent 21 years in the U.S. Army, including service as a family physician, chief of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital emergency room during Desert Storm and Desert Shield, and deputy commander of an Army medical center. Ted Epperly says recruiting more primary care doctors would improve access to quality health care. (CNN) --   Clayton Christensen, Jason Hwang and Vineeta Vijayaraghavan are right about one thing in their CNN commentary titled ""We don't need more doctors.""  America's health care system is broken. It requires significant reform if patients are to have access to convenient, affordable and -- most importantly -- high-quality care that results in good outcomes. But they have missed a central point. We need more primary care physicians now and we will need even more in the future as the baby boom generation ages. If Americans are to see meaningful health care reform, they must have a primary care doctor to whom they can turn for everyday problems: annual physicals and preventive care, diagnosis and treatment for common illness, and diagnosis and treatment of complex, chronic conditions, referral to subspecialists, and coordination of care provided by a team of professionals. Our current system has a serious and growing shortage of these primary care physicians. Today, only 30 percent of physicians provide primary care and 70 percent subspecialize in a single organ system or disease. We need a system in which patients get the right kind of care at the right time in the right place by the right type of provider. They need health services that provide not just convenient hours for minor health problems, but also medical expertise that ensures consistent, ongoing care; accurate diagnoses of symptoms; coordination with pharmacists, other specialists and allied health professionals such as physical therapists; consistent follow-up; and convenience. All at an affordable cost. Several health reform proposals set forth by President Obama and Congress would move federal policy in that direction. How? They incorporate convenience, efficiency, continuity of care and access to a system that relies on the patient-centered medical home -- a concept in which physicians coordinate care with a team of health professionals, offer evening and weekend office hours, and use electronic communication with patients and members of the health care team. But this concept won't be fulfilled unless we have health reform that increases the number of primary care physicians. Right now, America has a current and worsening shortage of primary medical care. Christensen, Hwang and Vijayaraghavan contend that increasing the number of physicians also leads to ""greater intensity of care, but not better health outcomes."" But their argument leaves out a major caveat. Although a greater number of subspecialists does increase the intensity, number and cost of services, research by Barbara Starfield at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health consistently demonstrates the opposite occurs in communities with more primary care physicians, particularly family physicians. Starfield concludes that an increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population resulted in a reduction of 34.6 deaths per 100,000 population at the state level. Katherine Baicker, professor of health economics at Harvard School of Public Health, and Amitabh Chandra at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government confirm these findings. Their research shows that increasing the number of primary care physicians results in a significant increase in the quality of health care and a reduction of cost to patients. However, increasing the number of subspecialists was associated with higher costs and poorer quality. At issue, then, is not the total number of physicians, but the number of family physicians and their primary care colleagues. Demographics, an aging population and resulting increased demand for services will require a significant increase in the number of these physicians. Given the long-term process required to train primary care physicians, we will continue to struggle with a shortage of primary care physicians, and that shortage will affect patients' access to care. Family physicians now are working to fill some of those gaps, according to a 2008 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians. The survey found 42 percent of respondents offer extended office hours and 29 percent provide open access or same-day scheduling. Moreover, 36 percent offer Web-based health information, 32 percent (up from 10 percent two years ago) prescribe medications by e-mail, and 21 percent (up from 18 percent two years ago) offer e-mail interactions. In short, despite the financial disincentives and other barriers in the current system, family physicians are working to meet patients' needs for convenience and access. They are improving this convenience and access with the help of nurses and nurse practitioners, who are excellent sources of care when patients have a known set of conditions and diagnoses that are amenable to treatment protocols. Likewise, walk-in clinics can fill the access gap when patients have an acute problem that requires a treatment that can be spelled out by an accepted protocol. However, even these clinics rely on an adequate number of primary care physicians. Most walk-in clinic staff realize that convenience should not trump quality or continuity, and most will refer patients to a primary care physician for follow-up and ongoing care. Again, without an adequate number of primary care physicians, these patients will have only partial access to the care they need. Family physicians and other primary care providers are part of the solution, not part of the problem. It is important at this critical time of restructuring the health care system to understand clearly what we are trying to accomplish. What we are building is a high-quality, accessible health care system that increases patient satisfaction and health care outcomes while we decrease cost and ethnic disparities. This is what a primary-care based health system will deliver. This is why President Obama and Congress aim to rebuild the U.S. health care system around primary care. This is why we need more primary care physicians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Ted Epperly.","Dr. Ted Epperly: America needs more primary care doctors to expand access .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by 12 months until June 2012, killing off speculation that he could be on his way to Real Madrid. Coach Mourinho has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to Inter Milan. Former Chelsea supremo Mourinho took charge at Italian giants Inter a year ago following the departure of Roberto Mancini and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto. They also won the Italian Super Cup, but were eliminated by defending champions Manchester United in the first knockout round of the Champions League. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ""In response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago, a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit, FC Internazionale announces the extension of Jose Mourinho's contract until 30 June 2012."" Mourinho had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first Italian title, but the eal issue refused to go away until Monday's statement. When asked about the chance he could leave Inter, Mourinho had earlier told the club Web site: ""There is still a 0.01% (chance). But for me this is not an important number, it just means that I am closer to Inter than to Real. ""I am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players. I repeat, I am closer to staying at Inter than going elsewhere."" Those comments failed to impress Inter president Massimo Moratti, but the extended contract has settled any differences. Mourinho made his mark at Porto in 2004 when he led the Portuguese team to the Champions League title, beating Monaco 3-0 in the final, before moving to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge he claimed the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons and the FA Cup the following campaign, but left the club in September 2007.

It stars French starlet Ludivine Sagnier as a young woman who rejects the amorous advances of a flashy, wealthy man her age, in favor of a sleazy affair with a fickle, 60 year-old father figure. Sagnier's desire to take on the role was also motivated by the allure of a much older man: Chabrol. ""The idea of working with Claude Chabrol was the main attraction at the beginning,"" she told CNN. ""He is a great French director, one of the pioneers of the French New Wave."" ""The guy has so much experience. I felt like I was a journalist, always asking things,"" continues Sagnier. ""He's very old ... he's been through many, many things. This was his 66th movie, or something like that."" Sagnier describes her character, Gabrielle de Neige, a charming, 20-something television weather girl, as ""very naive."" ""She falls in a trap like a poor little lamb and she gets eaten by wolves. ""The thing is, she doesn't have a dad, so she lacks affection, and sometimes that lack of affection can drive you to make mistakes. ""I'd say I'm stronger than that,"" says 29 year-old Sagnier, who is perhaps best-known for her provocative portrayal of a highly-sexualized teenager opposite Charlotte Rampling in Francois Ozon's 2003 drama, ""Swimming Pool."" Sagnier who is often compared with screen sirens like Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve, drew international acclaim for a series of films in 2002 and 2003, but has recently has been taking smaller roles. Many of the qualities that attracted Sagnier to Chabrol are similar to those that draw her on-screen alter-ego Gabrielle to writer Charles Saint-Denis (Francois Berleand) -- Charles' knowledge of life, literature and his ability to treat her like a little girl, not as an equal. Sagnier says of working with Chabrol: ""It was like opening a cinema book, because when you work with him he talks to you about Hitchcock, he talks to you about Kubrick. ""He met everyone, so he's full of anecdotes, so you want to know more."" Chabrol began his career in 1956, earning his stripes alongside fellow New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut. He became famous in the late 1960s for suspense thrillers such as ""La Femme Infidele"" (1969) and ""Le Boucher"" (1971). He has continued working prolifically in film and television ever since. Chabrol co-wrote the screenplay for the heartbreak drama, in which Sagnier character is consistently disappointed in love and let down by the men around her, with his step-daughter, Cecile Maistre, who also served as assistant director on the film. At the end of ""The Girl Cut In Two,"" Sagnier appears on stage as a magician's assistant, smiling in the spotlight as she hears applause rise from the audience, the attention perhaps curing her depression over lovers lost. She lies in a box, appearing to be cut in half, the trick functioning as an almost literal embodiment of the film's title -- but clearly there's more to it than meets the eye. ""She cuts into two men first of all, and she's also cut in two different sides of her personality,"" said Sagnier. ""She has a part of shade and a part of lightness."" Sagnier's fate since her collaboration with Chabrol has, thankfully, been a decidedly rosier affair: Since finishing ""The Girl Cut in Two,"" she has starred in Jean-Francois Richet's, ""Public Enemy No. 1,"" which received more nominations than any other film at the 2009 Cesar Awards, France's equivalent of the Oscars. The indefatigable Chabrol has recently wrapped up yet another film: ""Bellamy"" starring Gerard Depardieu.

"(Budget Travel) -- I've never been a fan of the cold. As a kid, my favorite part of skiing was the hot chocolate, and I relished blizzards for the snow days, not the snowball fights. So when I booked a trip to the Icehotel in northern Sweden, my family and friends were amused -- and a bit concerned, especially when I got sick days before my flight. ""You can't go to the Arctic with a cold!"" my mother admonished. The hotel in northern Sweden opens every year in early December and closes at the end of April. But I had good reason for wanting to sleep in a glorified freezer: As an environmental reporter, I was curious to see a place where people have turned snow and ice into a moneymaker, one that's spawned copycats in frigid spots from Canada to Romania. Conceived by Yngve Bergqvist, a river-rafting guide who wanted to lure visitors to the Arctic north during the winter, the Icehotel started out in 1990 as nothing more than a crude igloo. Now, it's a fanciful ice castle that's rebuilt every November with an unparalleled level of artistry -- which explains why each winter 16,000 guests pay hundreds of dollars a night to sleep on a slab of ice and thousands more make the trek just to tour the rooms for the day. The 30 most elaborate suites are the handiwork of a team of artists -- sculptors, painters, architects, even comic book illustrators -- many of whom have never worked with ice before. Wielding chain saws and chisels, they spend weeks crafting frozen furniture while electricians install lights to provide an ethereal glow. Surreal? Exceedingly. This winter, German furniture maker Jens Paulus and American industrial designer Joshua Space created a space-station room straight out of ""Star Trek,"" with giant carvings of the sun and moon on opposing walls and twinkling lights in the ceiling. British decorator Ben Rousseau and graffiti artist Insa devised the Getting Cold Feet suite, with oversize high-heeled ice shoes beside the bed. Twenty-nine unadorned snow caves offer a somewhat less pricey and more purist experience. Since no hotel would be complete without a bar, the artists also sculpt a chic space where guests can warm their innards with an Icebar Jukkasjärvi, a mix of vodka, blueberry liqueur, blue curaçao syrup and elderflower juice, sipped from a cube-shaped ice glass. Then there's the chapel, where designs etched into the ice walls resemble stained glass. About 150 couples tie the knot here each year, some brides bundled in snowsuits, others dressed in white wedding gowns, their teeth chattering as they recite their vows. When I arrive in Sweden, I'm surprised to find that the guests actually spend a lot of time in a pair of heated chalets that look like life-size gingerbread houses. The shower and bathroom are located in the one nearest the hotel -- because, really, who wants to sit on a frozen throne? And the other contains the restaurant, where chef Richard Näslin dreams up such intriguing dishes as arctic char ice cream, which has a slightly salty, smoky flavor and is much more delicious than it sounds. Budget Travel Dream Trip: Scale a volcano in Ecuador . After my dinner, wrapped in several layers of fleece and down, I waddle out to a tepee for a folk concert by native Laplander Yana Mangi. At the end of each song, the crowd responds with a uniquely Arctic ovation: muffled mitten clapping. My suite has a nautical theme, with walls curved into a frozen wave and an oval bed of bluish ice set beneath a clam-shaped headboard. Topped with a mattress and a reindeer skin, the setup looks snug. Almost. The temperature is a brisk 23 degrees Fahrenheit, and I'm still petrified I'll lose a finger to hypothermia, even in my head-to-toe winter wardrobe. I climb under the furry blanket, making sure not an inch of skin is exposed. Then I gaze through the slits in my microfleece face mask and marvel at the stillness. My breath comes in shallow white puffs. Soon, I'm fast asleep. The next thing I know, a hotel attendant is standing beside me with a cup of steaming lingonberry juice -- my wake-up call. Amazingly, I slept through the night, giving new meaning to the expression ""out cold."" I wiggle my fingers and toes -- they're tingly, but all there. Then I do what any sane person would: sprint to the chalet to thaw out in the shower and sauna. Most guests stay only one night, but I opt for a second. It's not to prove my mettle; I feel as if I've done that. Rather, I find my frosty alcove incredibly restful and therapeutic. Maybe the hotel should add an ice yoga studio next? IF YOU GO ... GETTING THERE A round-trip flight between New York and Stockholm on SAS costs about $700 in midwinter (flysas.com). From Stockholm, take a 16-hour train ride to Kiruna (from $44 round trip). The Icehotel is a $13 bus ride away. WHEN TO GO The hotel opens every year in early December and closes at the end of April. You have a chance of spotting the northern lights in December and January, but those are the coldest months -- temperatures can dip to 45 below. WHAT TO PACK Think wool and fleece layers; avoid cotton, which can trap moisture and make you colder. The hotel supplies boots and hats. For details, see icehotel.com/winter/adventure/dress. WHERE TO SPLURGE Don't miss the guided hotel tour ($37 per person). And how about an ice-sculpting lesson ($75 per person)? Or a six-hour snowmobile safari to see moose at their winter feeding grounds ($400 per person)? WHERE TO SAVE Tour the Icehotel by day, and then spend the night at Hotel Kebne in Kiruna (011-46/980-68-180, hotellkebne.com, from $100).

"MEXICO CITY (CNN) -- A moderately strong earthquake rocked Mexico City on Friday afternoon, shaking the earth in the sprawling capital. People in Mexico City stream into the street as a magnitude 5.7 earthquake hits. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake at magnitude 5.7, and placed the epicenter near the city of Puebla, about 85 miles southeast of Mexico City. It hit at 2:24 p.m. local time. The Mexican seismological service measured the quake at 5.9. People in the city reported the earth and buildings shaking. Thousands of panicked people streamed into the streets as stopped cars snarled traffic. Parts of the city were without electricity Friday afternoon but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Earthquakes are a frightening experience for the 20 million residents of Mexico City, where thousands of people perished in a massive quake in 1985. The city, built on volcanic ash and clay, is particularly vulnerable to temblors. Aldo Pontecorvo of the humanitarian agency World Vision said the shaking lasted about 20 seconds. It came out of nowhere and ""without any warning,"" said Pontecorvo, who said he was in his office when the quake struck. Earlier this month, a moderate earthquake was measured off the coast of Mexico's western Baja California peninsula.","U.S. Geological Survey measures quake at magnitude 5.7 .

"(CNN) -- It has been nearly 20 years since Poland's Solidarity movement defeated the Communist Party in an historic election that prompted the fall of communism across central and eastern Europe. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa takes the oath in front of Poland's National Assembly on December 22, 1990. CNN International marks this significant anniversary with ""The New Poland,"" a week of programming examining the transformation of Poland from 1989 to where it sits today on the world stage. The combination of daily live programming and special reports from CNN correspondents in cities across Poland culminates June 4 with ""Autumn of Change, an in-depth documentary that takes a retrospective look at the events leading up to the election exactly 20 years ago. Reflecting the tumultuous year of 1989, which changed Europe forever, ""Autumn of Change"" will mix live programming and documentary programming, unforgettable historical images with interviews past and present, and a huge online audience initiative through Poland, Hungary, Germany, the former Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, in a comprehensive narrative of events that have helped to shape the Europe of today. ""CNN's combination of historic footage, comprehensive reporting and access to Poland's key figures puts us in an unparalleled position to set the scene for how Poland was the catalyst for the Europe of today,"" said Mike McCarthy, vice president of coverage and feature programming for CNN International. ""In step with the anniversaries of the events themselves, CNN will invite viewers to take part in our ambitious account of how Europe has changed over the last 20 years and what the future may hold."" About the programming: . Just eight months after reporting from Poland for the week-long ""Eye on Poland"" special, Fionnuala Sweeney returns to the country to anchor the network's live coverage for ""The New Poland."" She will report on the various commemoration and celebration ceremonies throughout the week from cities across Poland including Warsaw, Krakow and Gdansk. In addition to Sweeney's live reports, CNN correspondent Frederik Pleitgen will take viewers inside the Poland of today looking at the political, cultural, social and economic changes that have taken place in the past 20 years. The programs include: . -- Gdansk Today: CNN explores the city of Gdansk, the birthplace of the Solidarity movement. We visit the main shipyard and spend the day with a foreman who has been working there for more than 30 years. He talks about the transformation since Solidarity was born and the challenges the shipyards face three decades on. Finally, CNN heads out to sea with a polish yacht maker and finds out how they are dealing with the economic crisis. -- Catholicism in Poland: CNN looks at the Catholic Church in Poland and the challenges it faces. We visit Religia TV, a new project that aims to attract Catholics as well as viewers from other religions. -- Business in Poland: Solidarity transformed Poland from a communist state into a capitalist economy eventually capable of becoming a democratic member of the EU. During the last 20 years, its economy developed at a thriving pace, but even today there are remnants of the old system. CNN speaks to a family-run business on the local economy. We also visit Poland's biggest copper mining and refining company. We find out how the global market place is impacting the global economy and Polish business. -- Polish Cuisine: CNN speaks to Krakow's top celebrity chef and historian Robert Maklowicz about Polish cuisine and the recent trend to return to its roots. -- Poland's Film School: CNN visits Poland's largest film production Centrex, the National Film, Television and Theatre School in Lodz, and finds out what makes this school so unique. About the documentary:   By combining narratives from key players within the Solidarity movement, the Communist leadership, CNN reporters who covered the events and Polish civilians who lived through it all, Autumn of Change charts the individuals, relationships and astonishing chain of events that shook eastern Europe to its foundations. About the online coverage:  CNN's television coverage will be complemented by a full interactive companion site. This special site will feature a number of pieces that reflect the cultural influence of this movement as well as narratives from some of the major figures involved in the process. Via iReport.com, CNN will also encourage viewers and users from Poland and elsewhere to submit content -- photos, videos and comments -- to illustrate personal experiences.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Fifteen years after his death, and after his family fought a very long bureaucratic battle with the government, Enrique Valdez's name was added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Rick Valdez looks at his father's name on the Wall on Monday. Valdez was a Marine gunnery sergeant wounded by shrapnel in August 1969, combat that left him a quadriplegic. Since his death in 1994, his family has been waiting for the Defense Department to answer their requests that Valdez be included on ""The Wall."" On Memorial Day, his family finally got their wish, as they watched his name officially added to ""The Wall."" His name was added to the registry after the Department of Defense declared he was eligible because he died from his war injuries. Rick Valdez was 7 when his father was deployed to Vietnam. ""The night he had to go to the bus station for his second tour of duty, that was the last time I saw him walking,"" the son recalled. ""The next time we saw him was at the Veterans Administration hospital in Long Beach [California], after they shipped him home,"" he said. The Marine was 32. ""There are people that are worse off than I was,"" Tina Valdez recalled his father always saying. ""I enlisted, and I served. I knew what I was getting into. And if this is the worst that could happen to me, well then, so be it."" When notification came weeks ago from the Defense Department that Valdez's name would be added to the Wall, there was no explanation with it. Valdez's family previously thought since he hadn't been killed during war, Enrique Valdez couldn't be on the wall. Comrades and others told the family that he could be added to ""The Wall ""as long as we could show that his death was a result of his [war] injuries,"" said daughter Tina Valdez. ""And when my father passed away, they put it on the death certificate, long before we even knew that this was a possibility."" Now, they couldn't be more thrilled that it's not a possibility anymore -- it's a reality -- though they don't have an explanation for why the Defense Department finally notified them. ""What changed?"" his daughter Tina Valdez asked. ""I've been sending [the Defense Department] the same information for 14 years. Why all of a sudden is it different now?"" But when she saw the fresh lettering earlier this month on Panel 17, she felt that an explanation didn't matter as much anymore. ""It's OK, because his name is here,"" she said.  Watch Gunnery Sgt.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- A militant group operating in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria said Monday that it had destroyed several major oil pipelines in response to a military offensive. File image shows Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta fighters. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said it had ""put out of operation"" a Chevron storage facility by destroying several pipelines that fed into it. ""This will henceforth become our standard mode of operation,"" the group said in a statement. The U.S.-based Chevron Corporation could not be immediately reached for an assessment of the damage. Nigeria's military has been clearing the western Niger Delta region in a major operation against MEND. The armed militant group demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those whom they consider corrupt politicians. The group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent. The recent violence -- which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking -- has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria, Africa's largest producer. ""We will continue our cat-and-mouse tactics with them (the military) until oil export ceases completely,"" the MEND statement said.","Militant group operating in oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria destroys oil pipelines .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- This classic chant of ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"" -- barked out by battalions of newsboys hawking newspapers -- died decades ago, a casualty of home delivery, mass distribution and the advent of coin-operated newspaper machines. Some coin-operated newspaper machines have lasted for 30 years, but lack of sales may force their retirement. But now as newspapers across the country wage a battle to survive in a market where readers are increasingly gravitating to the Internet for information, the fate of another industry fixture seems inevitable. Could those steel machines on street corners, distributing newspapers since the '50s, be headed for the scrap pile? To begin to answer the question, all it takes is an early morning visit with a man who feeds those machines. It's 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, and a white delivery truck for the New Jersey Record has just pulled into the parking lot outside the Plaza Diner in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The driver -- Mike, who asked that his last name not be used -- is at one of his 130 stops on an eight-hour shift that began at midnight. Mike's job, which takes less than a couple of minutes per stop, entails filling the coin-operated machine with the day's papers, collecting unsold copies and emptying the machine of its coins. Even though Mike has a full schedule and lots of stops, it doesn't equate to pushing as many papers as he once did. Mike loads 15 copies of the Record into one machine -- and that's a good load, he says. Other locations receive only five to seven copies. He's also tasked with filling machines for USA Today. Though he's been on this job for only two years, Mike has been on the route long enough to know business is down. He says newspapers sell better at train stations than from the street machines he services. The demise of newspapers across the country is getting a lot of front-page headlines. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer in Washington was just one of the most recent victims, ceasing print publication in March as declining circulation and plummeting advertising sales forced it to retrench and become just an online provider of journalism. Even the legendary New York Times will force readers to dig deeper for more coins as it raises prices June 1, with the price of a paper going from $1.50 to $2. The publication that touts ""All The News That's Fit to Print"" has been relying less on newspaper racks. In 1999, the Times had 13,300 vending machines, but today that number has shrunk to 5,678, according to Diane McNulty, spokeswoman for the Times. ""One of the factors is home delivery,"" McNulty said, adding, ""This was due to our national expansion -- where once many readers could only get copies from the newsstand or vending machine, they can now enjoy home delivery service."" But all the gloom-and-doom predictions that newspapers will one day disappear isn't scaring workers at the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, based in Shiner, Texas. The company lays claim to being the world's largest manufacturer of coin-operated and no-charge newspaper vending machines. Don Kaspar is president and a fourth-generation member of a family business that began in 1898 manufacturing wire products. ""There'll be printed newspapers for years and years"" said Kaspar, president of a company that is actually part of the larger Kaspar Wireworks. Still, he concedes, ""Business is down about 25 to 30 percent from about five years ago."" It wasn't until the late 1950s that the privately owned company was approached by the now defunct San Antonio Light newspaper to develop an early version of coin-operated newspaper machines. The early versions of newspaper machines were simple and made mostly of wire, but by the mid-1960s they were all made of metal. The machines typically consist of a thick metal housing, shelves, doors and hinges. But the heart of any machine is the coin mechanism, which can have 150 moving parts, according to the manufacturer. Some advanced models introduced in 1999 feature lithium batteries to run the coin-collecting mechanism. Often weighing around 100 pounds, these hand-assembled machines cost on average $450 each, with refurbished models selling for around $300, the company says. The zenith of the company's business may have been the 1980s, when the introduction of USA Today landed it a contract to build and deliver 100,000 coin-operated machines. Today only 65,000 machines populate the nation's sidewalks, according to a USA Today spokesperson. In 1985, Sho-Rack sold its 1 millionth newspaper machine and it has sold several hundred thousand since. Its biggest clients have been the giants of newspaper publishing, including Gannett, Tribune, Newhouse and the McClatchy newspaper groups. But the fate of those publishers directly affects the bottom line at Sho-Rack. ""Business now? It's certainly slowed down,"" said Kaspar. ""Free publication racks ... we've stayed fairly busy with those. Coin- operated machines? Newspapers are cutting costs and pulling a lot of the racks from outlying areas. As a result this causes a surplus number of racks and then ultimately less of a need for new racks from us."" Though the coin-operated machine business makes up 25 percent of the parent company's overall business, Sho-Rack has learned to diversify and adapt. ""We're not dependent on any one industry,"" Kaspar said. The company, which employs nearly 500 workers and occupies more than 500,000 square feet in a small rural town, also manufactures thousands of wire, tubing and sheet metal products. The average life span of a coin-operated newspaper machine depends on several factors. Some machines, even with modest refurbishments every couple of years, have lasted for 30 years. For others it can be five minutes after an encounter with a snowplow. For the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, as long as newspapers are printed and sold, its machines will gladly continue to accept coins.","Fewer customers buy from coin-operated newspaper machines .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama is expected to announce Friday the creation of the position of cyber czar, a person who will coordinate the nation's efforts to protect government and private computer systems from hackers, criminal gangs, terrorists and spies, people familiar with the plan said Thursday. President Obama is expected to announce Friday the creation of the position of ""cyber czar."" The czar will report to both the national security adviser and the head of the National Economic Council, the sources said. Obama will not name anyone Friday to the post because the selection process is ongoing, they said. In addition, the White House will release a 40-page report that sets broad goals for combating cyber intrusions, but does not spell out in detail how to do so, said the sources, who would not agree to be identified because the report has not been released. Shortly after taking office, Obama ordered a 60-day review intended to ensure the federal government's cyber initiatives were ""appropriately integrated, resourced and coordinated with Congress and the private sector."" Melissa Hathaway, a senior member of the National Security Council who led the review process, told a security conference late last year that a public-private partnership and international alliances would be key to solving cyber security problems. Another senior official said any solution would be a ""team sport"" requiring a ""holistic, comprehensive"" approach. Administration officials said that representatives of the private sector, government departments and agencies, academics, state and local officials and civil liberties and privacy experts were among those consulted during the review. The Department of Homeland Security reports the number of cyber attacks on government and private networks increased from 4,095 in 2005 to 72,065 in 2008. This month, a Transportation Department audit -- carried out after hackers got into a support system containing personnel records -- indicated the nation's air-traffic control system could be at risk. Hathaway expressed concern that critical infrastructures such as the nation's power grid and financial networks could be vulnerable. ""God forbid if somebody were to take down and or manipulate our financial system, and what would we do, and would it make the current financial crisis look like a walk in the park?"" she asked. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair recently told reporters the biggest cyber threat facing the United States is from nation states, particularly Russia and China. ""I think China is winning the sweepstakes for the origin of most attacks on U.S. persons and organizations,"" he said. The Bush administration's own review of the matter culminated in the mostly classified National Cybersecurity Initiative, which was enacted in January 2008. National Security Agency executive Sandra Stenar-Johnson said that plan consisted of 12 initiatives with three goals: reduce the current vulnerabilities in the system, defend against the full spectrum of threats, and develop next-generation technologies to maintain an edge over adversaries. The Bush initiative tapped the Department of Homeland Security as the lead agency in the cyber battle. Senior officials in the Obama administration say the White House will anchor the latest effort, providing guidance and direction to ensure all agencies and departments are working well together.","Obama will announce post Friday, sources say .

"(Budget Travel) -- Here's a snapshot of Portugal's defining experiences: beaches, cities, and food and wine. Get a sense of which ones fit your travel style and your budget. Sandy beaches dot Portugal's rugged coastline. Find a secluded beach . The Algarve, southern Portugal's balmy riviera, sees nothing but blue sky 300 days of the year. Admire the ocean views from the roof terrace at Dianamar, in the whitewashed old center of Albufeira, just a block from the beach. Rooms are simple, but all have private terraces, and the price includes a generous breakfast buffet and afternoon cake (doubles from $65). The most dramatic coastline is along the drive to the medieval fortress town of Lagos. (Cars can be rented for around $30 a day in Albufeira; book online with companies like Europcar.) Between Praia de Dona Ana and Porto do Mós, the cliffs have been broken by the wind and sea into jagged rock formations pierced by blowholes and grottoes. Secret half-moon bays of golden sand lie hidden from view from all but the ocean. An hour beyond Lagos is Europe's southwesternmost point: Cabo São Vicente, a cape whose plunging cliffs are dotted with crumbling medieval churches and castles. More than 500 years ago, Portuguese sailing ships left to explore the world from these shores. There's great hiking in the fragrant pine woods and peach orchards less than 20 miles inland, around the spa town of Monchique -- a cluster of tiny houses and 18th-century mansions tumbling down a steep, wooded valley. The trail up to the Picota peak has magnificent views out over the coast all the way to the cape. Families from Lisbon take weekends on the beaches of Cascais, less than 20 miles from the capital. There they jostle for space on three broad, short beaches and wander, ice cream in hand, along the ocean esplanade or the clusters of narrow streets crowded around the town's imposing fort. For wilder, lonelier sand, head to Guincho, four miles west. This sweeping, gently curved shoreline is pounded by some of the best surf in the eastern Atlantic. An almost constant wind makes for superb windsurfing; a world championship is hosted here most Augusts. But watch out for those rips and prepare for cold water. While the Algarve is good for swimming from spring to autumn, you'll need a wet suit around Cascais for all but the summer months. The town is easily reached from Lisbon; trains leave from Belém station every 15 minutes and take just over half an hour ($4.50 round trip). But if you choose to stay, take a room at the Solar Dom Carlos, a 16th-century manor in a quiet Cascais backstreet (doubles from $30). There's a pocket-size former Royal Chapel on the hotel grounds. Marvel at opulent chapels and palaces . Lisbon spreads in terra-cotta and cobblestone over seven hills, staring out over the Tagus River to the shimmering Atlantic. A rugged Moorish castle tops the skyline, and the streets are lined with baroque churches and Gaudíesque art nouveau buildings. Budget Travel Trip Coach: Friends explore Lisbon and beyond . Allow at least three days for a first visit, and make time for the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos. Extravagantly decorated doorways lead through long cloisters to a church supported by pillars adorned with stone ropes and coils of faux seaweed. These rise to a fan-vaulted ceiling whose thousands of tons of stone somehow look light and airy. Many Portuguese notables are buried at this monastery, including Luís de Camões, author of Portugal's national epic, Os Lusíadas, and the explorer Vasco da Gama. The Gulbenkian is one of the world's great small museums. Oil magnate Calouste Gulbenkian acquired a huge collection of Egyptian, European and Oriental artifacts and Renaissance art, which was brought to Lisbon after his death. Highlights include intricate Roman jewelry, opulent Moorish carpets and tapestries, paintings by Rembrandt and Van Dyck, and an extensive collection of René Lalique's art nouveau glassware. Finish your day with a late afternoon's wander around the narrow, cobbled streets of the Bairro Alto neighborhood on a cliff overlooking the 18th-century city center. There's a pretty medieval square or a magnificent church at every turn. The most beautiful is the Igreja de São Roque, whose simple exterior hides what was said at the time to be the most expensive chapel ever built -- a feast of rich gold work and beguilingly complex mosaics of lapus lazuli, ivory, agate, and precious metals. Built in Rome in 1742, it was blessed by the Pope before being transported in its entirety to Lisbon. It's an easy day trip from Lisbon to Sintra, a former royal retreat in cool forested hills near the coast. It looks like a Disney fantasy: pastel tiered castles crown the hilltops; faux-Moorish domed palaces lie hidden in wooded gardens; and extravagant, neo-Gothic mansions loom at the top of steep driveways. The grandest of all is the Palácio Nacional da Pena, rebuilt by Portugal's half-mad Austrian king-consort in the late 18th century (park and palace admission $14). It's a fascinating mishmash of Italian colonnades, Ottoman/Oriental turrets and windows painted in garish pinks and yellows. The interior of the building is preserved as it was when royalty fled during the 1910 revolt -- down to the tables set for dinner and the lamp-stand statues of turbaned Turks holding light bulbs. Sample robust wines and fresh fish . Every small Portuguese town has its own wine, traditional cakes and cheeses. In the Alentejo, cheeses are curdled with thistle flowers and washed down with rich, earthy red wines. Base yourself in Évora, a city founded by the Romans, expanded by the Moors and enriched by the Portuguese kings. Each group left its monuments; the cork forests and vineyards around the city are strewn with Iberian dolmens, for example. About 150 miles north, in the mountainous Beira region, is the village of Pinhel, famous for its red wines and vanilla-flavored cavaca candies -- invented by nuns from the local convents in the Middle Ages. Pinhel is a delightful maze of winding streets and makes a great base for hiking in the nearby park land, Serra da Estrela, or for visiting the Côa Valley, where rock faces are inscribed with Paleolithic art. The Douro River flows out of Spain into a deep valley stepped with some of Europe's oldest vine terraces. Port wine comes from here, together with some of Portugal's heartiest reds. The Douro Valley is easily seen on a boat cruise from Porto, a destination in its own right. Here stands one of the largest collections of Renaissance buildings in the Iberian Peninsula. Every other corner leads to a little baroque church whose modest façade hides an interior encrusted with tons of gold. Winding streets in the city's medieval center lead down the hillside to the river. Wander along the quays in Gaia across from Porto city and drop in on the various port wine warehouses for free samples. It's a great way to decide what kind to bring home as a gift. Cap off your day with dinner on the banks of the Douro at D. Tonho. The house specialties are bacalhau (salted cod served steamed or in little deep fried crispy balls), followed by pork fillets with clams or hake au gratin with seafood sauce. 7 insider tips . 1. English is widely spoken, and it's always more welcome than Spanish, which might even produce a scowl. Portugal and Spain have an age-old rivalry. Visitors trying to speak a few words of Portuguese will make many friends. 2. In the Algarve, everyone sees the ocean from the beaches. But it's just as much fun seeing the beaches from the ocean. Book an afternoon boat trip out of Albufeira Marina with one of the numerous agents on the Rua 5 de Outubro and be sure to take a camera to capture the golden afternoon light on the crumbling cliffs. 3. Portugal can be a difficult country for vegetarians. Even vegetable soup is cooked with meat stock. Be sure to state clearly that you don't eat any meat or fish -- even as seasoning. 4. For the coolest night out in Lisbon, head to co-owner John Malkovich's waterfront warehouse club, Lux Fragil, which is always packed with the most fashionable crowd on a Friday or Saturday night. 5. Lisbon has some of the liveliest African music in Europe; terrific Cape Verdean, Angolan and Mozambican singers make the city home. The hottest acts play at the Club B.Leza nights at Cabaret Maxime (from $20). For schedules of Luso-African concerts all over Lisbon, e-mail bleza21@gmail.com. 6. Portugal is a great country for driving. Small distances and an excellent and well-signposted road network mean that it's never a long journey to the next place of interest. And the whole country can be driven from north to south in a little over a day. But beware of Portuguese drivers. Hugging the fender and flashing headlamps furiously on the highway is common practice -- as is reckless passing. 7. Portugal is great for kids. Lisbon has a huge aquarium, and the dolphin and seal shows at the Zoomarine on the Algarve are some of the best in Europe. There are swimming pools and restaurants here, so you can stay for the whole day (adults $14). Timing . Portugal is sweltering in the summer (June through August) and very busy with European tourists. The spring (April through May) and autumn (September through October) are cooler, just as sunny and far less busy. The winter (November through March) is wet and cold. Price index .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three suspects were arrested after an explosives-packed van reduced a police building to rubble Wednesday in eastern Pakistan, killing 27. The scene of an apparent suicide car bomb attack on a police building in Lahore on May 27. The morning attack in Lahore -- Pakistan's second-largest city -- also wounded more than 250 people, most of them police officers and staffers, authorities said. Fourteen of the dead included police officers. Three others were identified as bodies of ""terrorists,"" said City Commissioner Khusro Pervez. Immediately after the blast, police arrested two of the suspects, said City Commissioner Khusro Pervez. Local television showed the men being led away by officers. Sir Ganga Ram hospital, which was damaged by the explosion, was treating 128 victims. Authorities expected the death toll to rise as rescue workers picked through twisted metal and other debris from the building, looking for more bodies.  Watch more on the attack » . The attack comes amid a Pakistani military offensive to rout militants from their haven in the northwestern part of the country. Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistan Taliban, had threatened to target major Pakistani cities if the operations did not cease. ""The enemies of Pakistan are trying their very best to use every venue to destabilize the country,"" Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters Wednesday. The blast occurred on Mall Road near the city police headquarters and the high court. It is one of Lahore's busiest areas. A passenger van, laden with explosives, broke through a security barrier and was headed toward the police building when guards opened fire to stop it, said Lahore's district coordination officer, Sajjad Ahmed Bhutta.  Watch rescue workers respond to the scene » . The two sides exchanged gunfire, with the attackers hurling grenades, said Faisal Gulzar, deputy police superintendent. The van exploded before it could reach the building. It was carrying an estimated 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of explosives, Bhutta said. The impact was immense. The targeted building -- Building 15 -- collapsed. It housed the city's rapid response team, which is dispatched during emergencies. At least 50 people were thought to have been inside the two-story building at the time, said police spokesman Ray Nazar Hayat. The police headquarters that sits adjacent to the building was also damaged. Motorcycles from a nearby dealership were strewed about, charred from the heat. The roof of four operating rooms caved at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, with 40 medical staff members suffering minor wounds. Police waved away onlookers in vain. Many of them jumped over the collapsed walls of Building 15 to look for survivors. Semi-conscious officers in blood-stained uniforms were pulled from under wooden planks. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, with suspicion falling on the beleaguered Islamic militants in the northwest who had vowed revenge. ""We're doing our best,"" Malik, the interior minister, said of the offensive in the northwest. ""Please do not forget we're in a state of insurgency. It's a fight for our survival. We had two choices: We surrender our country or we save it for our next generation."" Lahore is Pakistan's cultural capital, far removed from the fundamentalist interpretation of Islam that is embraced in the north of the country, which borders Afghanistan. Still, it has sporadically been swept into widening Islamist violence that grips the country. In March gunmen hurled grenades and opened fire on officers at a police training center, killing at least seven cadets. The same month gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying members of the Sri Lankan national cricket team on their way to a stadium for a match. The attack wounded at least eight members of the team and killed a driver and six Pakistani police officers. ""Everywhere in the city is insecurity,"" Haris Nadeem, a student in Lahore, said Wednesday. ""You never know when a blast is going to occur or where. A shopping center? A government office?"" Still, said Saleem Khan, residents forge ahead . ""We will avoid places when they are crowded, but we can't change everything,"" he said. ""We can't stop going out of our houses. Life has to go on.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The family of a woman who died ignored on an emergency room floor has reached a settlement with Health and Hospital Corp., the family's lawyer and the company's top executive said Thursday. Surveillance video shows Esmin Green on the hospital floor for more than an hour before anyone helps her. The attorney, Sanford Rubenstein, said the settlement, reached Wednesday, is for $2 million. Alan Aviles, the president and CEO of Health and Hospital Corp., said in a written statement that the company -- which operates Kings County Hospital, where Esmin Green, 49, died last year -- takes full responsibility for her death and offers a ""full apology."" He said the settlement ""is not meant to put a value on a life and the loss of a loved one. That remains priceless."" Last July, Green's relatives said they planned to file a $25 million lawsuit against the city and the hospital and called for criminal charges against hospital workers. A hospital security video showed that the mother of six waited in an emergency room chair for nearly 24 hours before she slid to the floor, where she convulsed for more than a half hour and then became still. An hour after she fell to the floor, the video showed, a hospital employee nudged Green with her foot and summoned help, but the 49-year-old woman was dead . The New York Civil Liberties Union alleges that hospital records were falsified to say that Green was ""sitting quietly in the waiting room"" at a time when, the video shows, she had been on the floor for 48 minutes and had not moved for more than 10 minutes. An autopsy revealed that Green died from pulmonary thromboembolism -- blood clots that formed in her legs and eventually made their way into her lungs, according to Ellen Borakove, the medical examiner's spokeswoman. The clots came from deep vein thrombosis, which complicated Green's chronic paranoid schizophrenia, she said.","Health and Hospital Corp., operates hospital where Esmin Green died last year .

"(CNN) -- Norwegian violinist, Alexander Rybak, 23, won the Eurovision Song Contest with an upbeat ballad that got the most votes in the history of one of the world's most watched television shows. Alexander Rybak of Norway performs during the final of the Eurovision Song Contest Saturday in Moscow, Russia. On Saturday night Rybak beat out contestants from 42 countries, with singers from Iceland and Azerbaijan taking distant second and third places. The boyish Rybak -- who performed a self-composed tune, ""Fairytale,"" with some deft dance steps and a smile plastered on his face -- won with 387 points, the most in the contest's 53-year history, organizers said. It was the third time Norway has won the competition. Although the classically-trained Rybak grew up outside the Norwegian capital, Oslo, he was born in Belarus. A television audience estimated at more than 100 million people watch the show. In years past, winners have parlayed their victory in varying degrees of success -- most notably the Swedish quartet ABBA, which won with ""Waterloo"" in 1974 and became one of the most successful pop groups of the 1970s. In the Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, each participating European nation submits one singer or group who then perform a specially-written song. Telephone votes as well as judges from each country decided the winner this year. This year the contest was televised from a packed stadium in Moscow, Russia. Earlier police arrested dozens of gay and lesbian rights activists who were planning a rally to coincide with the contest. The protesters wanted to draw attention to what they call widespread discrimination of gays in Russia.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier convicted of murdering an Iraqi family spoke out for the first time Thursday, issuing a public apology for his crimes. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green got life in prison after being convicted of murdering four Iraqis. Steven Green, who escaped the death penalty this month, told relatives of the victims that he is ""truly sorry for what I did in Iraq."" ""I helped to destroy a family and end the lives of four of my fellow human beings, and I wish that I could take it back, but I cannot,"" Green said, reading a statement at a victim impact hearing. ""And, as inadequate as this apology is, it is all I can give you."" The family refused to accept the apology. Green was found guilty in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of raping a 14-year-old girl and murdering her, her parents and her 6-year-old sister in the town of Yusufiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad, in 2006. A jury could not reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty, which means the judge is required under law to impose a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Green will be sentenced September 4, but the victim impact hearing was held Thursday so surviving members of the al-Janabi family could testify before they return to Iraq. They decried Green's sentence and testified about how the heinous crime had shattered their lives and how it will haunt them always. Green said that he knows ""you wish I was dead, and I do not hold that against you. If I was in your place, I am convinced beyond any doubt that I would feel the same way."" He added, ""I know that I have done evil, and I fear that the wrath of the Lord will come upon me on that day. But, I hope that you and your family at least can find some comfort in God's justice."" The wailing family matriarch, Hajia al-Janabi, lunged at Green as she left the witness stand, denouncing him as a coward, a criminal and a stigma on the United States, according to Louisville's Courier-Journal newspaper. Security officers restrained the distressed woman, the newspaper said. Another family member, Mahdi al-Janabi, said Green had lost the ability to distinguish between terrorists and Iraqi civilians. Green was tried in a civilian court in Paducah, Kentucky, because he had been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes surfaced. He was the last of five soldiers who served in the 101st Airborne Division, based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to be convicted for the crimes and their subsequent cover-up. The others -- Spec. James Barker, Sgt. Paul Cortez, Pfc. Jesse Spielman and Pfc. Bryan Howard -- received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years, with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases. Green said he now sees the Iraq war as ""intrinsically evil, because killing is intrinsically evil.""

"(CNN) -- With their nation under high security alert, South Koreans mourned a former leader at a funeral ceremony Friday morning. The hearse carrying Roh Moo-Hyun's coffin heads for Seoul at Roh's hometown village of Bonghwa in Gimhae. Officials and dignitaries gathered in Seoul's Kyungbok Palace to honor former President Roh Moo-Hyun, who committed suicide last week. South Koreans poured into the streets to catch a glimpse of the black Cadillac making a five-and-a-half hour journey from Roh's home in the village of Bongha to the capital. Some bowed their heads or wept openly. Others, still stunned from the loss, stood quietly in black as the hearse drove by. Scores of Roh's supporters handed out yellow balloons, the color associated with Roh's political campaign. Other supporters had posters of Roh's image that read, ""President in my heart"" and ""You are my president."" A person who walked by Roh's memorial site said, ""Roh understood the difficulties of normal people. We feel he acted like a shield for people with no power. He was the people's president."" One woman on her way to work in Seoul said: ""He was the first president South Koreans picked with their own hands."" She was referring to the fact that Roh didn't have a big political machine behind him. He won the election in 2002 by razor thin margin and his appeal was that he related to the common person. This week has been marred by grief and tension for South Koreans as they grappled with Roh's sudden death and renewed threats from North Korea. Following the official ceremony, Roh's body will be taken to the plaza in front of Seoul's city hall, where large crowds are expected to say goodbye to a beloved leader. He will be cremated later Friday and the remains carried back by hearse to Bongha. Roh, who served between 2003 and 2008, jumped from a hill behind his house last Saturday, government officials said. His death came amid an investigation into a bribery scandal that had tarnished his reputation. However, tens of thousands of people have visited memorial shrines for Roh, laying white chrysanthemums in a traditional show of grief and leaving cigarettes on the altars to remember a man who was reported to have taken up smoking during the investigation. In a suicide note given to the media by his lawyer, Roh wrote: ""I am in debt to too many people. Too many people have suffered because of me. And I cannot imagine the suffering they will go through in the future."" Prosecutors were investigating the former president for allegedly receiving $6 million in bribes from a South Korean businessman while in office. Roh's wife was scheduled to be questioned by prosecutors Saturday, and Roh was planning to answer a second round of questions next week.  Why some South Koreans are angry about Roh's death » . The investigation has now been suspended. The debate over Roh's suicide has occupied as much column space in South Korea's press as the recent aggressive behavior shown by the North. On Tuesday, the conservative Chosun Ilbo urged South Koreans to remember the words of the former president's suicide note. ""Roh's abrupt death brings home how vain the rise and fall of power is and how futile it is to nurse hatred and conflict in pursuit of them. Roh himself said in his will, 'Aren't life and death both part of nature? Don't blame anybody.' He would not have wished his own death to cause more political confusion and social conflict,"" the newspaper wrote in an editorial. It also criticized prosecutors who ""seem to have worried about public consensus rather than focusing on principles."" The left-leaning Hankoryeh called Roh's death ""political murder,"" echoing the widespread feeling that the former president paid too high a price for his alleged crime. ""The case of late President Roh was the most unfortunate in South Korean history, brought about by the Lee Myung-bak administration, which despised the person more than the crime,"" the newspaper wrote in an editorial. The mood on South Korea's influential blogs and message boards was somber and split between messages of comfort, dismay at Roh's decision to end his life and angry accusations against prosecutors and the government. ""President Roh's perseverance to provide Korea with a true democracy has come to a sudden end. We saw the grief of his demise in the eyes of millions of Koreans,"" read a message posted on the popular Daum Agora Web portal. ""Prosecutors and the police! Are you the people of the Republic of Korea?,"" asked another. Just before he left the presidency, Roh became the first South Korean leader to cross the demilitarized zone and meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. He believed in the ""sunshine policy"" of his predecessor, Kim Dae-Jung, that sought to engage the north, and Roh also promised aid.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The longest-serving Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee told CNN Radio on Thursday that, barring any surprises, Sonia Sotomayor is headed for a Supreme Court confirmation. Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic on the U.S. Supreme Court. ""If there are no otherwise disqualifying matters here, it appears to me she will probably be confirmed,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said. Hatch was acknowledging the current Senate political landscape. Sotomayor was nominated by a Democrat president, and Democrats could have 60 votes in the 100-member chamber if Minnesota's Al Franken is seated. They now hold 12 of the 19 seats on the Senate Judiciary Committee that will first consider Sotomayor's nomination. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, said Thursday he does not plan to vote to confirm Sotomayor, becoming the first Republican to explicitly state his opposition. ""She has made statements on the role of the appeals court I think is improper and incorrect,"" Roberts said. ""I think that we should be judging people not on race and gender, or background or ethnicity or a very compelling story."" Hatch -- who unlike Roberts voted in favor of Sotomayor's 1998 nomination to the federal appeals court -- also revealed one of the first Republican battle lines on the nomination: the schedule.  See Sotomayor's key rulings » . President Obama and other Sotomayor supporters say they want her confirmed before the Senate goes on its August recess, so that she can be well-situated for the start of the next Supreme Court session in October. Hatch and fellow Judiciary Committee Republicans Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas are pushing for a longer timeframe. They say it is almost impossible to review Sotomayor's extensive record, debate her nomination and hold a Senate vote by August. ""If the Democrats don't overplay their hand and don't try to rush this too much, the process will go well, they'll be better off, she'll get confirmed,"" Hatch said, again adding that his prediction is based on no new concerns coming to light. The opposition party usually fights for extensive time to try to find hidden issues in a Supreme Court nominee's record. Hatch said senators need three months to consider Sotomayor and that a vote should come in September, after the Senate's August break. A September vote would crunch Sotomayor's preparation time for setting up her office before the high court's next term begins. It also would complicate Democratic fights on health care and energy that could reach a critical point at that time.  See whom Sotomayor would sit alongside if she's confirmed » . Hatch insisted a September Senate vote would get Sotomayor on the bench in time for the new Supreme Court session. ""If they do it the right way,"" he said of Senate Democrats, ""and there is no otherwise disqualifying feature to this, it is highly likely she is going to be confirmed as the ninth justice on the Supreme Court in time to sit on the court on the first Monday of October."" Meetings on the timetable have begun. On Thursday, White House staffers met with aides to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee to go over this and their strategies for Sotomayor's confirmation, according to a Senate Democratic aide involved in the confirmation process. Sotomayor will go to Capitol Hill as early as Tuesday to meet with senators who will vote on her confirmation. The Judiciary Committee has not announced when the confirmation hearings will begin. Democrats were relieved Wednesday when Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, and the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he did not think Republicans would block the nomination with a filibuster. But prominent conservatives still are trying to stir public opinion against Sotomayor. Radio host Rush Limbaugh and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich have called her racist, pointing to an October 2001 speech at the University of California, Berkeley. During that speech, she said: ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" The Senate Democratic aide involved in the confirmation process said Democrats are pleased with the initial response from Republican senators to Sotomayor's nomination, saying it was a ""good sign"" that GOP senators have not adopted some of the language coming from Limbaugh and Gingrich. ""If the fire-breathing rhetoric is contained to the far right element, it doesn't jeopardize the nomination,"" the aide said. CNN's Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.","Sen.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)   -- Mexicans in the United States sent home 12.2 percent less money this past August than the same month last year, the Banco de Mexico said Wednesday. Mexicans in the U.S. are sending fewer dollars home and are suffering from a tough economy. That translates into remittances of $1.9 billion, versus $2.2 billion last year, said the bank, which blamed tough economic times in the United States for the decline. ""The prolonged deceleration of economic activity in the United States has adversely affected the opportunities for employment in that country and, consequently, those of the Mexican migrants,"" the bank said in a statement posted on its Web site. August's tally quickens a trend -- during the first eight months of the year, remittances fell 4 percent to $15.6 billion, the statement said. The numbers translate easily into stories of hardship. Marilyn Pena lives outside Mexico City and depends on remittances to get by. Her father migrated to Chicago 12 years ago to find work and, in good months, sends his daughter about $200 per week. But last week he sent nothing. ""He told me he has no more work because of the situation there,"" Pena said. ""Temporary workers are always the first to lose their jobs in crises like this one,"" said Luis Pena, an economist. ""Since many Mexicans in the United States are there illegally, they are most vulnerable to unemployment."" Some economists predict the drop will increase by year's end to 20 percent. After oil exports, remittances are Mexico's second-largest source of foreign currency. In Atlanta, Georgia, which has one of the greatest concentrations of Mexican residents in the southeastern United States, Yasmin Gutierrez runs a company that Mexican immigrants use to send dollars abroad. ""Before, they used to come every week and they used to send big amounts and lately, well, nothing, or almost nothing. Some clients are no longer coming, and those that are coming are sending small amounts."" Rosina Gonzalez, who ran a Western Union office in Atlanta several years ago and recently returned to the job, said she has noticed a big change. Back then, ""everyone was sending money to Mexico, Mexico, Mexico -- a lot of money,"" she said. ""Now, I'm returning to work after four or five years and the norm now is that the people who used to send money to Mexico are asking the people in Mexico to send money here."" Some are abandoning their hope for a slice of the American dream by opting to return to their country. The woman running the foreign-currency exchange service Afex, also in Atlanta, said business is so bad she is afraid of losing her job. CNN's Harris Whitbeck in Mexico City and Viviana Fernandez in Atlanta contributed to this story.","Bank: Mexicans in U.S. sent 12.2 percent less money back to Mexico than last August .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- OutKast's Big Boi is a junkie, has been for years. Big Boi: ""You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair."" The multiplatinum rap star got his first shoe fix back when he was better known as Antwan Patton, a busboy at Steak and Ale. He saved up his paychecks and rushed to a dealer to cop the only thing that could cure his jones -- a pair of British Knights tennis shoes. ""I've actually been into sneakers since I was a little kid,"" Big Boi, 34, said backstage before his concert this month at the Sneaker Pimps exhibition in Atlanta. ""You can really tell a lot about a person through the shoes, so I always like to keep me a fresh pair."" Sneaker culture has thrived for decades, but shoe companies have increasingly capitalized on the demand for one-of-a-kind kicks. Collectors, known as sneakerheads, have lined up to pay hundreds, even thousands, of dollars to ensure few people are wearing the same shoes.  See some of the rarest shoes » . ""Coming up, my mom got five kids so there wasn't a whole lot of stylish tennis shoes around the house, so I used to want a lot of sneakers,"" Big Boi said, explaining that he started making up for lost time -- and shoes -- long before OutKast's 1994 debut, ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik."" Juan Castaneda, 27, also grew up in a family of modest means and longed to don the fresh kicks he saw his peers wearing. ""When I got money to buy them, I started catching up,"" said Castaneda, who works at a nursing home in Hendersonville, North Carolina. He estimates he owns about 200 pairs of sneakers, including a pair of Nike Air Jordan XIs with patent-leather trim called ""Space Jams."" They cost him $500. It's supply and demand at its simplest, said Elliott Curtis, a former Carnegie Mellon University basketball player who for two semesters taught Sneakerology 101, billed as the first accredited class on sneaker culture. Shoe companies create a limited number (say, a few hundred pairs) of shoes -- even if it's just an old model with new colors or materials -- and demand automatically spikes. ""It's like a status symbol. If Nike is selling a shoe for $2,000, they're not expecting to sell that many,"" the recent graduate said, adding that sneakerheads are drawn to scarcity. ""If they've got money, they can buy coolness,"" Curtis said. Curtis goes to garage sales and mom-and-pop stores seeking rare and retro sneakers for his 75-pair collection, but he concedes he's waited in line for limited editions and paid as much as $250 for a pair. Sporting an ultra-rare set of blue-and-red ""Bugs Bunny"" Nike Air Jordan VIIIs, Big Boi said he today boasts at least 400 pairs of sneakers, but he rarely pays for them because shoe companies send him pairs. His most expensive, a pair of crocodile-skin Nike Air Force 1s, sell on various auction sites for up to $1,800. Big Boi has never worn them, but he plans on taking them out of their Nike lockbox this summer so he can wear them in a video for his upcoming solo album. To Peter Fahey, the mastermind behind Sneaker Pimps shoe shows, Big Boi's enthusiasm is typical. Sneaker culture got its start in New York in the 1970s, mostly among playground streetballers and practitioners of an emerging genre of music called hip-hop. Over the next three decades, rappers and basketball players -- most notably, Run DMC and Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan -- would play integral roles in boosting the popularity of rare kicks. ""Run DMC were probably at the height of the whole movement. It was the first time music and sneakers crossed like this,"" Fahey said of the group's 1986 hit, ""My Adidas."" Today, Adidas, Nike and Puma compete with luxury brands such as Chanel, Prada and Gucci. The major sports shoe companies also allow customers to design their own shoes. Upstarts such as San Francisco's JB Classics and Japan's Madfoot and KKOK have snatched up market share as well. Shoe companies realize hip-hop's influence and work hard to get ""a fresh pair of steps"" on a rapper's feet. Earlier this year, Converse released a line of its iconic All-Stars in tandem with Chicago rhymesmith Lupe Fiasco. Nike has issued two versions of the Air Yeezy, inspired by rapper-producer Kanye West. Louis Vuitton also has teamed up with West. Some lines, such as the Yeezys, quickly become collectors' items. Die-hard sneakerheads keep them in their original boxes like ""Star Wars"" action figures and ferret them away in closets, their soles never to be scuffed by a sidewalk. Bryan Lyle, 22, of Stockbridge, Georgia, said he recently camped out three nights at an Atlanta boutique to get one of the shop's eight pairs of Air Yeezys. Lyle paid $300, a small fortune for shoes, but Castaneda said the price more than doubled within days. He got a pair of Yeezys from an eBay merchant in Hong Kong. The damage? $700. Melissa Bailey of Hendersonville, North Carolina, takes photos at the Sneaker Pimps show. Castaneda's girlfriend, Melissa Bailey, 26, said Castaneda actually bought three pairs. He found two online and paid someone to camp out for the others. Castaneda's modus operandi is to buy three pairs of his favorite shoes -- one to wear, one to store for later and one to sell or trade, she said. ""He will not walk through grass. He will not walk through dirt,"" Bailey said. For the last six years, Fahey has had a front-row seat for the evolution of sneaker culture. He held the first Sneaker Pimps show in Sydney, Australia, in 2003, but only 200 people showed up, belying the trend's rising popularity. Soon, however, tens of thousands would attend shows in more than 60 cities. A 2006 show in Jakarta, Indonesia, drew about 13,000 sneakerheads. The shows now feature between 1,000 and 1,500 shoes. Some are rare. Others are signed by celebrities. Hip-hop acts are a staple, as is artwork -- on both kicks and canvas. At this month's show, hundreds of sneaker enthusiasts filed through Atlanta's Tabernacle with the decorum of museum patrons, stopping to admire the shoes displayed on swaths of chain-link fence. There were novice sneakerheads, such as Chris Shepherd, 20, and Charnelle Cook, 20, an Atlanta couple who marveled over the DC Comics and Transformers sneakers. Asked about her multicolored hightops, Cook said, ""I couldn't tell you what these are called. All I know is they're Reeboks, and they're fly."" There were seasoned collectors, such as Kyle Self, 35, of Decatur, Georgia, who said he had about 25 pairs, some of them still in their boxes. Included in the group are three pairs of $400 low-top Pradas, which he called his ""everyday sneakers."" There were even female collectors, such as artist Estasha Goodwin, 23, who modeled a pair of shimmering gold, winged -- yes, winged -- hightops made by Adidas and designer Jeremy Scott. She complained that shoe companies too often focus on the male market and ignored female aficionados. ""When they do cater to us, it's always bubblegum pink. They don't even make them in our sizes,"" she said. ""I know women who know more about sneakers than any dude out here today."" Incidentally, her favorite of the 15 pairs she owns were made for men -- the Nike ""Ace of Spades"" Dunks, inspired by the Detroit Tigers' high-kicking pitcher, Dontrelle Willis, who is prominently featured on the black-and-aqua shoe's hightop. Asked why she shelled out $250 for them, she gave a familiar response: ""It's a feeling you get when you know you're the only one that has something. Even if you're not, it's the way you walk it.""","Big Boi says he has 400 pairs, including crocodile-skin Nikes he's never worn .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's GDP fell 4 percent last quarter, the fastest pace on record, the government said on Wednesday. A homeless man pulls his cart filled with possessions and goods for recycling on March 18 in Osaka, Japan. The January-March quarter for Japan was 15.4 percent lower than the same time period last year, according to figures released by the Cabinet Office. Exports fell 26 percent on quarter, while imports were down 15 percent. The GDP slide in the world's second-largest economy is the greatest drop among the world's leading economies. By comparison, GDP in the United States fell 6.1 percent on an annual basis. This was the fourth straight quarter the Japanese economy contracted. Analysts say the drop reflects cuts in domestic spending with job cuts, factory closings and less capital spending as a result of spiraling sales abroad. The news punctuates a month of poor economic news out of Japan in recent weeks. Panasonic, one of the world's largest makers of electronic devices, announced it lost nearly $4 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31. Hitachi lost $8 billion in the fiscal year, with consolidated revenues down 11 percent from last year, the largest loss ever recorded by a Japanese manufacturer. NEC Corporation lost $3 billion in the past fiscal year, down nearly 11.5 percent from last year. Meanwhile, Nissan lost $2.3 billion for the year.Sony Corp. announced net losses of $1 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, finishing a year in the red for the first time in 14 years.","Japan's GDP fell 4 percent last quarter, the fastest pace on record.

"(CNN) -- A Utah man with chronic health problems died Wednesday from complications associated with swine flu, a local health official said. If confirmed, it would be the ninth U.S. fatality associated with the flu outbreak. Memorials appeared at the door of I.S. 238 in Queens, New York, this week after the death of an administrator. The man, who was from around Salt Lake City, was between 18 and 25 years old and ""had chronic medical conditions that may have contributed to severe complications from influenza,"" said Gary Edwards, executive director of the Salt Lake Valley Health Department. Also on Wednesday, health and education officials in New York announced that 21 of the city's public schools had been closed after an increase of reports of students with flu-like symptoms. A school administrator in Queens died after being hospitalized with the H1N1 virus, commonly called swine flu. Nineteen of the schools closed at the recommendation of the Health Department are public and two are private, the city's Education Department announced in a news release. In addition, two private schools in Manhattan -- St. Davis Academy and Horace Mann -- have decided on their own to close after a number of students exhibited flu-like symptoms, according the schools' Web sites. In the city's news release, city Health Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden repeated what has become a familiar refrain: ""We continue to see a rising tide of flu in many parts of New York City. As the virus spreads, we will look to slow transmission within individual school communities by closing individual schools."" Late last week the city closed 11 schools in Queens and one in Brooklyn after confirming cases of the virus at Intermediate School 238 in Queens and unusually high levels of flu-like symptoms in the others. Mitchell Wiener, an assistant principal at I.S. 238 who died Sunday after being hospitalized with the disease, had an underlying condition, according to Frieden. The death in Utah was the first associated with the swine flu, or H1N1, virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has linked eight U.S. deaths to the flu outbreak, but had not confirmed a link to H1N1 in the Utah death as of Wednesday evening. The outbreak has sickened at least 10,176 people and caused at least 80 deaths -- mostly in Mexico, according to the World Health Organization. The actual number of people affected may be higher, as it takes time for national governments to confirm cases and report them to the global body. In the United States, at least 5,710 cases of swine flu have been reported, according to recent figures from the CDC. Utah officials echoed national agencies in saying that the swine flu has largely behaved like typical seasonal influenza, which usually is fatal only among the very old, the very young or people with other health problems. In New York, 19 of the schools closed at the recommendation of the Health Department are public and two are private, it and the city's Education Department announced in a news release. In addition, two private schools in Manhattan -- St. Davis Academy and Horace Mann -- have decided on their own to close after a number of students exhibited flu-like symptoms, according the schools' Web sites.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean and U.S. forces have been placed on a higher surveillance alert level, after North Korea threatened military action following its nuclear test earlier this week, the joint forces announced on Thursday. South Korean soldiers use binoculars to look at North Korea on Wednesday in Paju, South Korea. The ""Watchcon"" alert was raised to its second-highest level on Thursday, a government spokeswoman told CNN. The last time the joint forces raised the surveillance alert was after North Korea's last nuclear test in 2006, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. The separate five-stage combat alert level, known as ""Defcon,"" has not changed and remains at stage 4, South Korean defense spokesman Won Tae-jae said at Thursday's briefing, according to Yonhap. ""Additional intelligence assets, including personnel, will be deployed while reconnaissance operations over North Korea will increase,"" Won said, according to Yonhap. He declined to give specific details, the news agency said.  Watch Hillary Clinton's warning about 'consequences' » . North Korea conducted a nuclear test Monday and fired five short-range missiles Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, the country threatened military action  after South Korea joined a U.S.-led effort to limit the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction. There has also been recent activity at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility, according to U.S. officials, who cited information from U.S. spy satellites. The officials would not speculate about the type of activity. North Korea agreed in 2008 to scrap its nuclear weapons program -- which it said had produced enough plutonium for about seven atomic bombs -- in exchange for economic aid. But the deal foundered over verification and disclosure issues, and the North expelled international inspectors and announced plans to restart its main nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon complex.

"(CNN)  -- Maria Sharapova stepped up her comeback after injury to claim the scalp of 11th seed Nadia Pedrova to reach the third round of the French Open in Paris on Wednesday. Sealed with a kiss. Sharapova celebrates her victory over Petrova. The former world number one had come into the second grand slam of the season with only two matches in a minor tournament in Poland under her belt, but surprised her fellow Russian with a 6-2 1-6 8-6 victory. Still playing with tape on her troublesome right shoulder, Sharapova showed no ill effects as she won five straight games to take the first set. Petrova hit back in style to force a decider and took the lead with an early break. But Sharapova hit back in the eighth game to level and held her own service under pressure in the next two games. Petrova finally wilted as she served at 6-7, giving Sharapova match point with a double fault and then hitting wide on a forehand after two hours 12 minutes. Sharapova will now face qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan for a place in the last 16. She had shoulder surgery in August last year and missed both the U.S. Open and Australian Open as fears for her future in the game grew. She made a brief comeback by playing doubles in Miami in March before a return to singles action at the Warsaw Open where she reached the quarterfinals before losing to Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine. Meanwhile, defending champion Ana Ivanovic showed a welcome return to form by sweeping into the last 32 with a 6-1 6-2 victory over Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn. The 21-year-old Serbian has slipped down the world rankings since lifting the title at the Stade Roland Garros, but is making a strong defense on her favored clay. World number one Dinara Safina also impressed with a 6-1 6-1 win over fellow Russian Vitalia Diatchenko. She has dropped just two games in reaching the third round as she bids to back up her ranking with a first grand slam title.","Maria Sharapova beats 11th seed Nadia Petrova at French Open in Paris .

"(CNN) -- Somalia needs international help to fight Islamist extremists battling for power in the lawless Horn of Africa nation, the country's moderate Islamist president said Monday. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was recently appointed Somalia's transitional president. ""I am calling on the international community to help Somalia defend against foreign militants who have invaded the country,"" President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said. Speaking at a news conference in Somalia's capital city, Mogadishu, Ahmed called several times for international help in fighting foreign militants whom he claims are the same fighters who have fought the ""international community"" in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Wherever they come, they fuel violence,"" the president said. ""The Somali people cannot and should not accept that their countries should be a launching pad for these militants to attack."" Ahmed told local journalists that he feared these foreign fighters would turn Somalia into another Iraq or Afghanistan, where U.S.-led forces are fighting Islamic extremist groups. He also praised local militias in the two regions of Hiiran and Middle Shabelle for struggling against the foreign militias. Last week, al-Shabab militants advanced to the presidential palace in Mogadishu, sparking sporadic fighting and shelling in the Somali capital. The recent fighting has killed more than 40 civilians and wounded about 150 others, according to sources at the scene. Al-Shabab -- once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union -- has been designated as a terrorist group by the United States, which says it is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network. Ahmed participated in seizing control of Mogadishu in 2006 along with the Islamic Courts Union before it was ousted by Ethiopian forces later that year. He has since split from Somali jihad movements and was recently appointed Somalia's transitional president through a process shepherded by the United Nations. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed speaking at a conference in Mogadishu .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. If you've rolled up your sleeves and gotten experience, tell potential employers when applying for a job. Talk to a dozen students on any college campus and you're likely to hear a dozen different perspectives on what they hope to get out of college. Some want high GPAs; some want to get into the work force and earn a lot of money. Ask their parents and you'll get just as many different answers. Some parents hope that their children earn their degree and have an easy time finding a job. Others want them to be at the top of the class so they can get into the best graduate school possible. And some just want their children to stop partying long enough to attend class once in a while. Ask employers what they want from graduates and the answers are equally diverse. Depending on the job, you might need a degree and an internship, a degree and work experience, or the right connections to even land an interview. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 39 million Americans over the age of 18 have a bachelor's degree. Considering that 281 million people live in the country, college graduates are still a small percentage of the population. Still, with a number in the millions, you are competing with a lot of job seekers who also have the same educational background as you. Relying only on your bachelor's to land a job is not the safest route to employment. As with most things, it's all in the presentation. Degree or not, presentation matters . Sue Chehrenegar studied biology as an undergraduate and biomedical research as a graduate student. During her job search, she found herself losing out on job opportunities because she lacked the proper experience, despite her education. Or so she thought. ""At the end of the 1980s, I spent more than one year looking for a job,"" she remembers. ""I kept getting this question: 'Have you done anything in the area of molecular biology?'"" She would tell employers that she didn't have the proper experience because she wasn't specifically trained for that. ""I did not mention the fact that I once assisted a graduate student who was putting DNA and RNA into cultured cells."" What does that mean in layman's terms? Because her specialization and the bulk of her experience was not in this particular field, she didn't consider the limited work with the graduate student worth mentioning. She later realized employers weren't looking for someone to be the ultimate authority on the subject; they wanted someone who had a broad range of knowledge. ""I realized my mistake more than two years after I got a job,"" Chehrenegar remembers. ""My first year I worked in an infectious disease lab. Later, they put me in a molecular biology lab. When I helped with one of the projects in that lab, I realized that my old, unmentioned experience related to what I was doing at that time."" A degree isn't useless . Sure, if you're applying for a job with bio- as a prefix, you know a degree is a requirement. But for less research-intensive jobs, you might think a degree can always be supplanted by enough experience. Depending on your occupation, that could be true but isn't a hard and fast rule for all positions. For example, you might be able to find work at a museum, but you the odds of you transitioning into a curator can be extremely difficult without extensive education in art history and related courses. You could find that you hit a ceiling in an organization. Although this bodes well for graduates who come armed with one or more degrees, it also means that workers in this industry have the opportunity to earn an education while they ascend the corporate ladder. In some cases, the combination of their experience and a recently awarded degree could be more impressive if you've relied on your degree and haven't diversified your experience. How to present yourself . Here are some tips to keep in mind when presenting yourself to employers: . • Even though you know education isn't the single factor in getting hired, it is often a prerequisite to land an interview. Don't hide your degree just because you have a lot of experience -- you don't want to lose out on an interview because your education was overlooked. • Use all of your education to your advantage. Connect the job requirements to any courses you took, whether as an elective or part of your minor. You might not have loved that statistics course, but if it's relevant to the job, mention it. • Treat work experience and internships as proof that you're a professional, not just a student. If you speak as if you see yourself as a student who doesn't consider himself or herself as part of the working world, the employer might not either. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009.

"(CNN) -- When Tiffany Wilson noticed a small growth on her left hip, she didn't think much of it. Tiffany Wilson, 41, found a bump on her hip that she thought was a pimple. It turned out to be skin cancer. ""It was bizarre,"" recalled the 41-year-old salon owner from Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""I just thought it was a pimple."" Wilson, who is African-American, can't say exactly what prompted her to point out the bump to her physician, but she said she remembered thinking the diagnosis wouldn't be anything serious. ""It never occurred to me that it was skin cancer,"" she said. But it was. She had basal cell carcinoma, the most common skin cancer. Wilson spent long hours as a child in the summer sun at Lake Nokomis in Minnesota and went to the tanning bed before visiting relatives in the Caribbean, she said. She also said she never wore sunscreen. ""Back then, I just don't think people were aware of the effects [of the sun],"" she said. Those may seem like obvious red flags to people who are sun-conscious, but they were foreign concepts to Wilson, which is why her diagnosis came as a shock. ""I just assumed, 'I'm a person of color, I'll be OK,' "" she said. Dermatologists say they are concerned because skin cancer rates are increasing among minority groups in the United States. Like Wilson, many people of color often mistakenly believe skin cancer is not something they should be worried about. Pigmentation is no 'free pass' The reasoning is not completely far-fetched: Darker-skinned people do benefit from the protective effects of skin pigmentation. In fact, some studies suggest that for the darkest skin tones, pigmentation cells provide a natural sun protection factor, or SPF, of about 13. The problem is many dark-skinned people believe that means they are born with a natural immunity to skin cancer. ""Pigmentation doesn't give you a free pass,"" said Dr. Charles E. Crutchfield III, a dermatologist specializing in ethnic skin and the doctor who treated Tiffany Wilson. ""It doesn't matter what color your skin is, everyone can get skin cancer."" Bob Marley, for example, died of malignant melanoma, the most lethal type of skin cancer, that spread to his lungs and brain. All types of skin cancer are increasing among blacks and Hispanics, and their melanomas are more often fatal because they are usually caught later, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Crutchfield pointed out that pigmentation may have sun-protective qualities but even for the darkest skin it falls short of the AAD's recommendation of a daily SPF of at least 15 for everyone. Crutchfield feels many ethnic groups are missing that key part of the message, if they are getting the message at all. Blog: How to pick the right sunscreen . Researchers acknowledge that many of the messages regarding skin cancer prevention have traditionally targeted fair-skinned people, a group 10 times more likely to develop melanoma. Now, dermatologists say, more needs to be done to encourage all groups to take precautions against sun damage. A Consumer Reports survey found only 27 percent of people with self-described darker skin applied sunscreen when they were in the sun for four hours or more, compared with 64 percent of people with self-described light skin. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2009 there will be more than 1 million unreported cases of basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer -- most of them curable -- and that more than 68,000 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed. For melanoma, the key to a cure is early detection. That's why dermatologists caution everyone to be vigilant and learn the risks for their skin type. ""Race is very important because not all skin is the same,"" said Dr. Susan Taylor of The Skin of Color Center, a dermatology group focusing on the needs of patients of color. According to Taylor, people with darker skin often get diagnosed at later stages because the cancers often appear in atypical locations. Melanomas in African-Americans and darker-skinned Hispanics and Asians develop more commonly on the palms, soles of the feet, toenails, fingernails and in mucus membranes like around the mouth and genitals, she said. In Caucasian and lighter-skinned Hispanics, melanomas more frequently appear on the back in men and on the legs in women. Also, the signs of melanoma may vary depending on skin tone. ""Skin hue can affect the way lesions look,"" Crutchfield said. ""Things that appear red in white skin often look completely different in skin of color."" Historically, research and teaching was done on fairer-skinned people, making it more challenging for physicians to recognize suspicious moles on darker skin. While these differences present challenges, they are certainly not barriers. Experts say, the best thing to do is keep it simple. ""If you have any lesion or mole change at all, or if you have a spot that bleeds and doesn't heal in three weeks, see a physician or a dermatologist,"" Dr. Crutchfield recommended. ""That's something everyone can do."" Visit the American Academy of Dermatology Web site to find free screening locations in your state . Another piece of simple advice: ""All racial groups need to use sunscreens,"" Taylor stresses. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both deep-penetrating UVA rays and burn-causing UVB rays. Not all sunscreens protect against both. Visit the Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep cosmetic safety database . Tiffany Wilson is heeding that advice. She said she's learned that when it comes to prevention, the worst thing you can possibly do is nothing. ""I use extreme caution in the sun and make certain that I use a sunscreen, even on a cloudy day,"" she said. ""You shouldn't underestimate the rays of the sun.

"(CNN) -- A Florida man arrested with his wife on anabolic steroid possession charges claimed to have sold steroids to professional hockey and baseball players in the District of Columbia, but the National Hockey League and Washington Capitals said Wednesday they doubted the allegation. Richard Thomas and his wife, Sandra, were arrested Tuesday night at their home in Lakeland, Florida. Richard Thomas, 35, told officers he sold the steroids to unidentified players on the NHL's Capitals and the Washington Nationals of baseball's National League, said Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County, Florida. ""Richard Thomas told us that he sold steroids to ballplayers on those teams,"" Judd said after the arrests late Tuesday night. ""Now, is that one ballplayer to two ballplayers? We don't know."" NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league would investigate the claim, but added that the Washington Capitals ""have no knowledge of any aspect of this allegation."" ""Capitals players were subjected to no-notice testing five separate times over the past two seasons pursuant to the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and there was no indication of any improper conduct or wrongdoing,"" Daly said in a statement issued Wednesday. A separate statement by Capitals president Dick Patrick said the team had ""no reason to believe there is any merit to this story,"" but would fully cooperate with the NHL's investigation. MLB.com, the Web site of Major League Baseball, reported Wednesday that the league would look into the allegation involving the Washington Nationals. The report posted on the Web site of the Washington Nationals quoted Nationals president Stan Kasten as saying the team knew nothing about the steroids claim, and that the league was handling it. Thomas and his wife, Sandra, 49, were arrested Tuesday night at their home in Lakeland, Florida, on 21 counts of possession of anabolic steroids, importation of anabolic steroids and maintaining a residence for drug sales, Judd said. He said the couple has been charged with 10 counts of steroid possession with intent to distribute, 10 counts of importing the drugs and one count of maintaining a residence for drug sales. According to Judd, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Philadelphia received information that the Florida couple would be receiving a shipment of steroids. Judd's office then obtained a search warrant for the Lakeland home, where officers found steroids from points outside the United States, including Iran, he said. The arrest report says Richard Thomas told officers he was ""the biggest steroids dealer in central Florida."" Bond for Richard and Sandra Thomas was set at $215,000 each, said Carrie Eleazer, spokeswoman for the Polk County Sheriff's Office, and Sandra Thomas was released on bail Wednesday afternoon. The two are scheduled to make an initial court appearance Thursday. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Couple arrested in central Florida on anabolic steroid possession charges .

"(CNN) -- A North Korean rocket slated for launch sometime early next month can be clearly seen in a satellite photograph taken Sunday. Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptors are located at the Ministry of Defense on March 29 in Tokyo, Japan. The satellite imagery, obtained by the Institute for Science and International Security from DigitalGlobe, shows the rocket at the Musudan-ri launch site in northeastern North Korea, casting a shadow on the ground below. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday there is little doubt that the planned launch is designed to bolster that country's military capability. He also indicated that the U.S. military could be prepared to shoot down a North Korean missile if the rogue regime develops the capability to reach Hawaii or the western continental United States in a future launch. The North Korean government says it will launch a commercial satellite atop a rocket sometime between April 4 and April 8. ""I don't know anyone at a senior level in the American government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile,"" Gates said during an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday."" Gates noted that while the United States believes it is North Korea's ""long-term intent"" to add a nuclear warhead to any such missile, he ""personally would be skeptical that they have the ability right now to do that.""  Watch how the U.S. is responding to a planned launch » . Japan recently mobilized its missile defense system -- an unprecedented step -- in response to the planned North Korean launch, Japanese officials said. The move, noteworthy for a country with a pacifist constitution, is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into Japanese territory.  See a satellite image of the launch site » . In a concurrent response, U.S. Navy ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles are being moved to the Sea of Japan, a Navy spokesman said Thursday. Gates said that the U.S. military could shoot down ""an aberrant missile, one that was headed for Hawaii ... or something like that, we might consider it, but I don't think we have any plans to (do) anything like that at this point."" He does not believe North Korea currently has the technology to reach Alaska or Pacific coast. Gates said that an impending missile launch is a clear demonstration of the failure of the recent six-party talks to disarm the North Korean regime. ""It's very troubling. The reality is that the six-party talks really have not made any headway any time recently,"" he said. ""If (the missile launch) is Kim Jong-Il's welcoming present to a new president ... it says a lot about the imperviousness of this regime in North Korea to any kind of diplomatic overtures."" Gates said that he believes economic sanctions are the best tool to getting countries like North Korea and Iran to the negotiating table. Both countries are believed by the United States and other Western nations to be trying to acquire nuclear capability.","North Korea says it will launch a commercial satellite atop a rocket between April 4-8 .

"SOMERSET COUNTY, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A chain link fence now stands between Tim Lambert's land and the impact site of United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed here on September 11, 2001. The property has been in Lambert's family for almost 80 years. A temporary memorial has been set up to honor the victims of the United Airlines Flight 93 crash. ""My grandfather purchased about 200 acres in the 1930s, and he would cut timber and sell the timber off, and he would build cabins as well,"" Lambert says. ""That's how he got the family through the Depression."" Lambert says he had no plans for the land, he just knew he wanted to hold on to it. ""There's a lot of natural resources in this area -- natural gas, coal,"" he says. That all changed the day 40 passengers and crew died trying to take control of a Boeing 757 that had been hijacked by four terrorists as it took off from Newark, New Jersey, bound for San Francisco, California. It is believed the hijackers had intended crash the plane into the White House or the U.S. Capitol. Plans for a permanent memorial have been in the works for years. Congress passed a law in 2002 instructing the National Park Service to establish a national memorial where the crash occurred. Part of it would be on Lambert's land. In the seven years since, some of the most important land needed for the massive project has remained in limbo, producing an emotional debate among landowners, family members and the National Park Service. See plans for the proposed Flight 93 Memorial . At the center of the dispute is the government's plan to take the remaining land needed by using its power of eminent domain. The government can seize privately owned property to convert it to public use after paying the owner fair market value. Lambert's land is key to the project. He owns 6 acres that are just feet from the crash site. He has yet to reach an agreement with the government to buy his land. ""Eminent domain was sort of dropped on us at the last second here,"" he says, ""and it feels like we never even had a chance to talk about some of the issues that we needed to address during the negotiations."" Lambert still finds debris from the plane on his land. ""Red and blue wire all over the place,"" he says as he bends over to pick up a piece. ""Here it is almost eight years later."" The National Park Service says time is running out if the memorial is to be ready by September 11, 2011, the 10-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks. It says it has to use eminent domain for 166 essential acres that it has been unable to purchase. ""We've held off using it until we've got here, really at the very last stage of this where we have no other choice,"" says National Park Service associate director Steve Whitesell. The amount of land needed for the memorial is just over 2,200 acres, about 1,400 of which  is near the crash site, where there will be a visitor center. The other 800 acres would create a buffer around the site to protect the rural setting. That is where Randy and Linda Musser live -- on more than 100 acres of land, 62 of  them within the memorial park boundaries. The Mussers enjoy hunting, fishing and horseback riding on their land, which is about three-quarters-of-a-mile from the crash site. ""This eminent domain cloud hangs over this whole piece of property now,"" Randy Musser says, standing by a pond where he likes to fish. He was a member of a committee formed with Flight 93 family members to establish the boundaries of the park. ""If I knew the National Park Service was going to be able to use eminent domain to acquire property within the park boundary, I would had fought that at the time the park boundary was established to keep as much property out of the park as possible,"" Musser says. The Mussers now fear that their land isn't safe from the government and say it's not needed for the memorial. ""We have to play fair, we have to follow the rules and they just change the law to suit their own needs,"" says Linda Musser. For Patrick White, vice president of Families of Flight 93, this project is a labor of love. White's cousin, Louis Nacke, was killed on United Flight 93. White is leading the effort to acquire all the land needed for the memorial. ""We're creating a place where the 40 heroes of Flight 93 can be revered and remembered,"" White said from his law office in Naples, Florida. White says the negotiations with landowners has been challenging and supports the governments use of eminent domain. ""No one has ever questioned that there is a public purpose to these lands'"" White says. ""Their purpose became public the minute that those private citizens' lives and remains became part of those lands."" Lambert says he feels the same way as he walks just a few feet from where the plane crashed. ""A lot of people lost their lives here and this is their final resting place. ... That's one thing I always keep in mind when I come here and I am walking through these woods."" This isn't just about money, Randy Musser says. It's about doing what's right, allowing landowners to continue to live on their land and use it the way they intended before that day. ""That loss of freedom is probably the thing that bothers people more than anything else,"" he says. Neither the government nor landowners will comment on how much money has been offered for the land yet to be acquired. Patrick White said he remains confident the memorial will be completed in time.  ""Getting this done is a commitment that must be achieved. ... These are folks who as citizen soldiers stood up and we all need to recognize that at a place that's appropriate."" To make that happen, the National Park Service says it needs to start construction this November for a ribbon-cutting ceremony on September 11, 2011. The courts may have the final say. Government lawyers are expected to file a lawsuit in Pittsburgh next week to condemn the property for public use.","Hijacked United Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania during the 9/11 attacks .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A Canadian auto parts supplier has come to the rescue of German carmaker Opel, negotiating a deal with the German government that will save the company from insolvency. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck talks to reporters early Saturday morning following talks on Opel. Officials from all sides announced the agreement after talks lasting into the early hours of Saturday. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called it a ""responsible solution"" that would preserve the highest number of jobs. Under the terms of the deal, supplier Magna will have a 20 percent stake in GM Europe, an arm of General Motors, which owns the Opel brand. Russia's Sberbank will own a 35 percent share, Opel employees will have 10 percent, and General Motors will retain a 35-percent stake, according to GM spokesman Joerg Schrott. The German government will provide a bridge loan to keep GM Europe operating in the short term. The deal ensures that General Motors' European assets -- which also include the Vauxhall car brand in Britain -- will be unaffected by GM's expected bankruptcy filing. Magna warned during negotiations that it would have to cut about 10,000 jobs. General Motors has around 55,000 employees in Europe. About 2,000 of the job cuts would be in Germany, Magna has said, but a top company official tried to reassure the Germans that it would try to protect the company as much as possible. ""We will, and I want to stress that again, preserve all the German Opel locations,"" said Magna co-Chief Executive Siegfried Wolf. ""We're keen to have talks with all the states where Opel has factories in the next few weeks and are confident to be able to find solutions to preserve jobs, because every job that is lost is one too many. We will work with Opel management to try to avoid those job losses."" Steinmeier told reporters that such risks can't be avoided. ""But,"" he said. ""I think we have found a responsible solution with private investors and interim funding from the state. It is a solution which preserves Opel's location in Germany and also preserves the highest possible number of jobs."" German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said early Saturday that the country has guaranteed transitional credit for Opel of 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion). In addition, a trust will be created where Opel's stock will be parked prior to the division of shares. Along with Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank, Russian automaker GAZ Group will provide some financing, said Andrzej Kasperek, director of corporate business development with GAZ. ""I think the whole arrangement with Magna and the Russian partners made this a very attractive deal for GM,"" Kasperek said. ""Opel is very well regarded as a brand. But we think we can increase sales in the next five years."" Financially strapped General Motors is expected to announce as soon as Monday that it is filing for bankruptcy. ""Opel has received a perspective for the future,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the agreement was reached. ""That is a chance for the employees, who have earned it, as I find, because they are not to blame for the situation but instead big mismanagement in the United States of America at GM."" Merkel said the German government did ""what it had to do"" in rescuing Opel. ""I had an open exchange in a phone call with the American president, and we agreed that we do everything to bring this complex task to a good conclusion. And this clearly set the tone for the negotiations,"" Merkel said.","Germany picks Magna to buy majority stake in Opel, news reports say .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican navy said Wednesday that it rescued five Ecuadorians who had been adrift without supplies in a fishing boat for more than two weeks off the coast of the southern state of Chiapas. Mexican medical personel examine two of five Ecuadorians rescued at sea. Mexican authorities initiated the rescue, which occurred Tuesday, after the U.S. Coast Guard alerted them that sailors aboard a fishing boat located 45 nautical miles (83 km) southeast of Port Chiapas had signaled to a passing plane that they needed help. The Mexican navy dispatched a helicopter, which located the 15-meter-long (49-foot-long) vessel and carried out the rescue by air, the navy said in a news release. The five aboard identified themselves as Jaime Arturo Alaba Chavez, the 35-year-old captain; Víctor Hugo Alaba Chavez, the 32-year-old cook; Edison Prado Alaba, a 27-year-old sailor; Carlos Cheme Vazquez, a 37-year-old sailor; and Raul Contreras Vera, a 64-year-old machinist. The sailors were taken to the Naval Sanatorium of Puerto Chiapas, where doctors determined they were dehydrated. They said they had departed Costa Rica's on May 6 but, five days later, their motor stopped working and, unable to repair it, they had been adrift and without food since. A naval patrol boat towed the boat to Puerto Chiapas, arriving there Wednesday morning. It will be inspected to rule out the possibility that it may have been used for illicit activities, the navy said.","The Mexican navy said Wednesday that it rescued five Ecuadorians adrift at sea .

"They're bigger, brawnier, and faster than the typical male, but are National Football League players healthier than other men their age? Justin Bannan, who plays for the Baltimore Ravens, participated in the study on NFL players. Yes and no, according to a new NFL-funded study that looks at the cardiovascular health of young athletes. The good news is that NFL players have cholesterol levels similar to other men in their 20s and 30s, and their blood sugar tends to be even healthier. However, they are much more likely to have high blood pressure or borderline hypertension when compared with men who aren't professional athletes. ""It's a step in the right direction to have this study,"" says Justin Bannan, 30, who plays defensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens and took part in the research. ""I think the more information we can find out and the more studies we can do, the better."" The study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is important, particularly as more and more players are weighing in at 300-plus pounds. The extra weight could potentially strain an athlete's heart in youth or even after retirement, and many question whether it has played a role in a handful of high-profile deaths. Health.com: Eat right advice: Fiber, starch, fats, serving sizes . In particular, the death of Thomas Herrion at age 23 has raised concerns about the heart health of larger players. Herrion, who was 6'3"" and 330 pounds, had just finished an exhibition game with the San Francisco 49ers when he collapsed and died in 2005. ""He's sort of the prototype of the bigger, stronger linemen that populates the NFL now, as compared with 20 or 30 years ago,"" says lead study author Dr. Andrew M. Tucker, the team physician for the Baltimore Ravens. ""We have so many big, strong guys over 300 pounds. I think that case in particular was important in stimulating the whole study and the investigation."" Other heavy players-- such as defensive end Reggie White-- have also died at an early age. White was 43 when he died from cardiac arrhythmia in 2004. In the study, Tucker, who is the cochair of the NFL subcommittee on cardiovascular health, and his colleagues looked at 504 active players from 12 teams in 2007. The researchers measured the players' height, weight, percentage of body fat, and other factors, and then compared them to 1,959 men ages 23 to 35 who participated in a study called CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults). Health.com: 20 little ways to lose drop the pounds and keep them off . They found that players were less likely to smoke or have blood-sugar problems than other men (only 6.7 percent of players had impaired fasting glucose compared to 15.5 percent of other men) and their cholesterol levels were essentially the same. However, 13.8 percent of players had high blood pressure and 64.5 percent had prehypertension, or borderline high blood pressure, compared to 5.5 percent and 24.2 percent of other men, respectively. Tucker notes that the football players outweighed the men in the CARDIA study by an average of 70 pounds and that it's natural to assume that larger people may have higher blood pressure. ""But what was fascinating to us was the category of prehypertension,"" says  Tucker, who is also the medical director of sports medicine at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Health.com: How to eat out without getting fat . The study found that NFL athletes are more likely to have prehypertension than other men-- regardless of the size of the player or his position. ""So our lean players who play defensive back and wide receiver, they have prevalence of prehypertension just as common as the really big guys playing offensive and defensive line,"" says Tucker. ""So there's something that we're trying to investigate now that accounts for elevated blood pressures in our active players that is not accounted for by size alone-- there's got to be something else."" Health.com: Cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions . That ""something else"" could be strength or resistance training, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sleep apnea (which is characterized by heavy snoring and a hike in blood pressure), or diet, including excessive sodium intake. Dr. Tucker doesn't think anabolic steroids are to blame. Even though he and his colleagues didn't ask players if they used steroids, he says that the NFL's year-round testing program should have ruled out any use. ""[However] I'm concerned about the widespread use of performance-enhancing agents, which contain stimulants that can not only increase blood pressure but of course have stimulating effects on the heart,"" says Dr. Tucker. He adds that, in the last several years, such stimulants have been linked to sporadic deaths in college and even professional athletes. Although today's players are much more likely to weigh in excess of 300 pounds than those in the past, it doesn't necessarily mean they are fat, Dr. Tucker explains. Athletes are larger nowadays due to rule changes in the 1970s and 1980s that were aimed at protecting their lower bodies; those guidelines also gave larger players a competitive advantage. If one goes by body mass index alone-- a measure of height and weight that doesn't take into account muscle mass-- more than half of players are obese, according to a 2005 study. However, Tucker and his team found that the average percentage of body fat was 14 percent, ranging from 8 percent to 10 percent in the leaner positions-- such as wide receivers and linebackers-- to 20 percent in defensive linemen and 25 percent in offensive linemen. ""Even our offensive linemen are really on the upper limits of what's considered healthy,"" says Tucker. ""There are plenty of my regular patients who would take that."" Health.com: Olympic swimmer discusses life with exercise-induced asthma . Overall, Tucker says he is most worried about older, retired athletes. ""I'm concerned about whether there is a constellation of things going on that puts them at risk when they're 45 or 55,"" he says. More attention is being paid to detraining athletes so that they can adopt healthier lifestyles and better nutrition after they retire, says William Kraemer, Ph.D., a professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut. ""It really is tough because you're trying to stay big in your playing days,"" says Kraemer. ""The big fear is, [after retirement] you stop exercising and you keep eating the way you used to when you were expending a lot of calories. A lot of times when kids get out of college or they get out of the pros, there is no system in place that helps them make the transition."" The Ravens' Bannan says the older generation is teaching younger players the importance of changing their lifestyle after retirement. ""If you're a heavier player, a lineman that's over 300 pounds, really what it comes down to is a lifestyle change and eating healthier, losing weight when you are done, and staying active and staying healthy,"" says Bannan, who is 6'3"" and 310 pounds. ""Make a few changes in your life; I think that's going to make things a lot better for you down the road."" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN)  -- What does it really take to dress someone as fashion-forward and in the spotlight as Michelle Obama? Designer Yigal Azrouël talks with students at the Savannah College of Art and Design. ""Bravery,"" says Isabel Toledo, designer of the first lady's attention-grabbing lemongrass yellow wool and lace ensemble that she wore for the inauguration of her husband President Obama. But along with bravery about their fashion sense, new graduates at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) will need courage in the face of the current recession. ""Fashion is being hit particularly hard in the new job market. Fashion as a whole is feeling a greater level of lost revenues and in turn has lost opportunities for sustaining volume and even more so for growth,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst and expert fashion analyst for the NPD market research group. ""The ironic thing is that new ideas and creations are just what the industry needs but is too cautious to react to it,"" he added. Full of new ideas, student designers say they are aware of the challenges as they head out into the work force, but they're optimistic they can make it in these tough times. ""After I graduate, I'm going to New York, I have an internship lined up with a trend forecasting company, Promostyl,"" said Shelby Simon whose designs made it into SCAD's annual fashion show.  See the runway fashions » . ""Everyone needs an assistant so hopefully I'll be able to find something pretty easily,"" said Caitlin Clarke. She would like to land an internship in New York and has interviewed with New York & Co. and applied for positions at Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Zac Posen. Toledo, a world-renown designer, knows it can be tough to make it in fashion. She and her fashion illustrator husband Ruben Toledo didn't have much money when they arrived from Cuba in the late 60s as political refugees. She says she found inspiration in the little things.  Experts' advice on getting to top of fashion business » . ""Go out there and look at things, look at things well. Study them; the smallest things can inspire you. That will make you able to do what you want on any level. Many times kids think you have to have all this backing coming into a big industry. I didn't do that, I started from the bottom and as a matter of fact you can only go up,"" said Isabel Toledo. Toledo was at the school last weekend to accept the 2009 André Leon Talley Lifetime Achievement Award. But for six months, two other top designers, Yigal Azrouël and Lars Nilsson, have been mentoring and critiquing 23 students to help them develop their designs for the runway. Azrouël, a self-taught designer, says it's a tough industry and students have to pay their dues. ""It's not what people think it is or what it looks like from the outside. If you want to be a fashion designer you have to carry fabric on your back, you need to learn how to cut and sew. The fame is going to come later."" More known for his expert draping techniques, Yigal Azrouël taught students more than how to incorporate intricate folds and pleats in their designs. ""If you love something, go ahead and do it, but, be very consistent with it,"" advised Azrouël. SCAD senior Caitlin Clarke says working with Nilsson really helped her create new silhouettes and structured angles with interesting seams. ""Lars was so helpful. I remember this one time when he came in and said 'Ah, there's something not right with this dress' and then he helped me cut it up and fix it,"" said Clarke. Nilsson enjoyed the process. ""I really tried to spend a lot of time seeing what they [the students] had to say, giving them advice and push them forward to express themselves,"" said Nilsson. ""It's been a great collaboration, and I must say that I've learned a lot myself, too."" The visiting designers give the students an edge in their job search, says SCAD president Paula Wallace. ""It's very important to bring in the top professionals because they inspire the students and they provide contacts and networking for the students after they graduate."" Students are also using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace to reach out to their peers and other industry professionals. In order to succeed you have to have innovative approaches to market, sell and sustain your product lines, said retail analyst Hitha Prabhakar. Right now retailers are in ""survival of the fittest"" mode and a handful of designers including Mui Mui, Allessandro Del Acqua, Allegra Hicks and Krizia have had to shut their store doors on Madison Avenue, she said. SCAD senior Shelby Simon feels some students went into fashion because they like to shop, but she warns there is so much more to learn about the craft.. ""The truth is hard work, nose to the grind stone and learning. All the people I know who became great designers didn't do it over night,"" said Vogue magazine's editor-at-large André Leon Talley, who has been involved with SCAD students over the years. ""Jason Wu, a wonderful designer, a young designer, was making doll clothes for years. He was saving his money then opened his own company and look where he is today, dressing Michelle Obama.""","Fashion industry job market is being hit very hard, analyst says .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Gunmen on motorcycles fired Friday on a campaign office for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wounding two adults and a child, according to a report by Iran's state-run news agency. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was not present at the time of the attack. The shooting happened about 5 p.m. in front of the entrance to the campaign office, campaign representative Mohammed Reza Zahed Shaikhi told IRNA. Ahmadinejad, who is running for a second term in office, was not present. Iran's presidential election will take place on June 12. The attack happened in Sistan-Balochistan province in southeastern Iran, the same province where a Shia mosque was bombed Thursday. Several suspects have been arrested in connection with Thursday's attack in the town of Zahedan, which killed between 15 and 20 people, according to Iranian media reports. No group publicly accepted responsibility for the mosque attack, but the provincial governor, Ali-Mohammad Azad, blamed a terrorist group that he said would be unveiled to the public once the suspects have been interrogated, IRNA reported. Zahedan is about 1,100 km (700 miles) southeast of Tehran, near Iran's borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Sistan-Balochistan province -- which shares a border with Pakistan -- is the site of frequent clashes involving Iranian police, drug dealers and armed groups. The province is located on a major narcotics-smuggling route between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Azad said information on the arrested terrorist group would be unveiled to the public once interrogations were complete. ""The terrorists and notorious gang planned to stir order and security in the province on the eve of (the June 12 presidential) elections, using ongoing insecurity in our eastern neighbors,"" he said Thursday. Several days of mourning were reported to be under way for victims of the explosion. Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a hard-line cleric who led Friday prayers in Tehran, said there were signs that the United States and Israel were involved in the mosque bombing, IRNA reported. The cleric, who put the death toll at 25, condemned the bombing before a congregation on the Tehran University campus. CNN's Shirzad Bozorghmehr contributed to this report.","Gunmen fire on campaign office for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- This classic chant of ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"" -- barked out by battalions of newsboys hawking newspapers -- died decades ago, a casualty of home delivery, mass distribution and the advent of coin-operated newspaper machines. Some coin-operated newspaper machines have lasted for 30 years, but lack of sales may force their retirement. But now as newspapers across the country wage a battle to survive in a market where readers are increasingly gravitating to the Internet for information, the fate of another industry fixture seems inevitable. Could those steel machines on street corners, distributing newspapers since the '50s, be headed for the scrap pile? To begin to answer the question, all it takes is an early morning visit with a man who feeds those machines. It's 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, and a white delivery truck for the New Jersey Record has just pulled into the parking lot outside the Plaza Diner in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The driver -- Mike, who asked that his last name not be used -- is at one of his 130 stops on an eight-hour shift that began at midnight. Mike's job, which takes less than a couple of minutes per stop, entails filling the coin-operated machine with the day's papers, collecting unsold copies and emptying the machine of its coins. Even though Mike has a full schedule and lots of stops, it doesn't equate to pushing as many papers as he once did. Mike loads 15 copies of the Record into one machine -- and that's a good load, he says. Other locations receive only five to seven copies. He's also tasked with filling machines for USA Today. Though he's been on this job for only two years, Mike has been on the route long enough to know business is down. He says newspapers sell better at train stations than from the street machines he services. The demise of newspapers across the country is getting a lot of front-page headlines. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer in Washington was just one of the most recent victims, ceasing print publication in March as declining circulation and plummeting advertising sales forced it to retrench and become just an online provider of journalism. Even the legendary New York Times will force readers to dig deeper for more coins as it raises prices June 1, with the price of a paper going from $1.50 to $2. The publication that touts ""All The News That's Fit to Print"" has been relying less on newspaper racks. In 1999, the Times had 13,300 vending machines, but today that number has shrunk to 5,678, according to Diane McNulty, spokeswoman for the Times. ""One of the factors is home delivery,"" McNulty said, adding, ""This was due to our national expansion -- where once many readers could only get copies from the newsstand or vending machine, they can now enjoy home delivery service."" But all the gloom-and-doom predictions that newspapers will one day disappear isn't scaring workers at the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, based in Shiner, Texas. The company lays claim to being the world's largest manufacturer of coin-operated and no-charge newspaper vending machines. Don Kaspar is president and a fourth-generation member of a family business that began in 1898 manufacturing wire products. ""There'll be printed newspapers for years and years"" said Kaspar, president of a company that is actually part of the larger Kaspar Wireworks. Still, he concedes, ""Business is down about 25 to 30 percent from about five years ago."" It wasn't until the late 1950s that the privately owned company was approached by the now defunct San Antonio Light newspaper to develop an early version of coin-operated newspaper machines. The early versions of newspaper machines were simple and made mostly of wire, but by the mid-1960s they were all made of metal. The machines typically consist of a thick metal housing, shelves, doors and hinges. But the heart of any machine is the coin mechanism, which can have 150 moving parts, according to the manufacturer. Some advanced models introduced in 1999 feature lithium batteries to run the coin-collecting mechanism. Often weighing around 100 pounds, these hand-assembled machines cost on average $450 each, with refurbished models selling for around $300, the company says. The zenith of the company's business may have been the 1980s, when the introduction of USA Today landed it a contract to build and deliver 100,000 coin-operated machines. Today only 65,000 machines populate the nation's sidewalks, according to a USA Today spokesperson. In 1985, Sho-Rack sold its 1 millionth newspaper machine and it has sold several hundred thousand since. Its biggest clients have been the giants of newspaper publishing, including Gannett, Tribune, Newhouse and the McClatchy newspaper groups. But the fate of those publishers directly affects the bottom line at Sho-Rack. ""Business now? It's certainly slowed down,"" said Kaspar. ""Free publication racks ... we've stayed fairly busy with those. Coin- operated machines? Newspapers are cutting costs and pulling a lot of the racks from outlying areas. As a result this causes a surplus number of racks and then ultimately less of a need for new racks from us."" Though the coin-operated machine business makes up 25 percent of the parent company's overall business, Sho-Rack has learned to diversify and adapt. ""We're not dependent on any one industry,"" Kaspar said. The company, which employs nearly 500 workers and occupies more than 500,000 square feet in a small rural town, also manufactures thousands of wire, tubing and sheet metal products. The average life span of a coin-operated newspaper machine depends on several factors. Some machines, even with modest refurbishments every couple of years, have lasted for 30 years. For others it can be five minutes after an encounter with a snowplow. For the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, as long as newspapers are printed and sold, its machines will gladly continue to accept coins.","Fewer customers buy from coin-operated newspaper machines .

"(CNN) -- IBM's reported plans to lay off thousands of U.S. workers and outsource many of those jobs to India, even as the company angles for billions in stimulus money, doesn't sit well with employee rights advocates. Business Week reports that IBM's workforce increased from 386,558 in 2007 to 398,000 at the end of 2008. IBM employees are being dealt a double blow, said Lee Conrad, national coordinator for Alliance@IBM, a pro-union group that has been fighting IBM's outsourcing for years. ""We're outraged that jobs cuts are happening in the U.S. and the work is being shifted offshore,"" Conrad said. ""This comes at the same time IBM has its hand out for stimulus money. This to us is totally unacceptable."" IBM wants a share of the money in President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for projects updating power grids, creating electronic health care records and furthering the use of broadband. ""In the research we've done working with the transition team, we know that $30 billion could create 1 million jobs in the next 12 months,"" IBM CEO Sam Palmisano said in January.  Watch how IBM hopes to benefit from the stimulus » . The problem is where those jobs would be, said Ron Hira, a professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. ""This is really a question of policy,"" Hira said. ""IBM is doing what's in its best interest, and in this case it's not in the best interest of America. And that's why you need policymakers to step in to ensure that this money gets spent to create American jobs.""  Watch the outcry generated by IBM » . IBM has not responded to multiple requests for comment from CNN after the Wall Street Journal's report that the IT giant would be shipping 5,000 U.S. jobs overseas. ""We have no problem with job creation in other countries,"" Conrad said. ""We have no problem with global expansion. We realize IBM is a global company and has been for many years. But this is different. This is cutting jobs in the U.S. and shifting the work offshore. This isn't job creation. It's job shifting."" According to Business Week, IBM has indeed been shifting jobs. The magazine reported that the company's workforce went up from 386,558 at the end of 2007 to 398,000 at the end of 2008. But U.S. employment fell from 121,000 to 115,000 during the same time. Hira, author of the book ""Outsourcing America,"" said it's not just IBM moving jobs out of the United States. ""The problem here, though, is that these companies have an inordinate influence over the political process,"" he said. ""They have a huge, disproportionate amount of power, political power, and can influence the process.""

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Police armed with rubber bullets were patrolling neighborhoods in Johannesburg on Tuesday in an effort to quell a recent spree of violence aimed at foreigners that police say has killed 22 people and displaced an estimated 13,000. A crowd armed with clubs, machetes and axes rioted on the outskirts of Johannesburg on Tuesday. Many of the victims are Zimbabweans who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances in their homeland. Evidence of the violence was seen in smoke rising from burned homes in one Johannesburg neighborhood. Locals angry about the rising number of foreigners arriving in South Africa had set homes ablaze. Firefighters said they had fought more than 100 such blazes since Thursday. Standing outside a row of charred homes, Diamond Minnaar said there is a solution for foreigners. ""Most of them just have to go back to their country and leave us in peace,"" Minnaar said. ""That is the only solution. Or they are just going to get killed. Look at how many shacks have burnt down."" The attacks and looting have drawn condemnation from South African officials and other African leaders. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video . The violence began a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township, police say, and has been concentrated in the city's poorest areas. ""People are angry because they are unemployed, poverty-affected people struggling for basic needs every day,"" said Dean Christopher Barends, a local Lutheran minister. ""This will explode into something."" One person victimized was Pascoal Sendela Gulane, a Mozambican man, who said gangs broke into his home and stole his belongings. He fled to a church with his family and is now living with his children in his car on the church's property. For him and many others, churches and police stations have become safe havens.  Watch footage of the attacks » . On Monday, South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an end to the violence. ""We dehumanize ourselves the moment we start thinking of another person as less human than we are simply because they come from another country"" he said in a statement. ""As South Africans, we must recognize and fully appreciate that we are bound together with other Africans by history, culture, economics and, above all, by destiny. I call upon those behind these shameful and criminal acts to stop! Nothing can justify it."" He has called for an investigation into the violence. Also Monday, the Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement condemning the ""senseless violence."" South African police have arrested more than 200 people in connection with the violence for offenses including rape, murder, robbery and theft. Police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said that at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend, while others saw their houses torched, their shops looted and their possessions stolen. Tuesday there was a large police presence in the neighborhoods were the violence had occurred, according to a CNN producer on the scene. Despite the police presence, sporadic looting still took place in several townships east of Johannesburg. Mbuso Mthembu, provincial manager at the Red Cross office in Johannesburg, said that the number of people fleeing is continuing to grow and that violent attacks seem to be spreading into other areas. His organization has made an emergency appeal for people to donate 1 million rand (about $135,000) to help support the estimated 13,000 who have fled their homes. Many had to flee quickly, leaving all their belongings behind, Mthembu said. ""We have delivered blankets, kids clothing, baby formula,"" he said. ""But we need more.""","An estimated 13,000 people fled homes after violence targeting foreigners .

"(CNN) -- ""American Idol"" viewers had a clear choice when it came down to the final decision: the low-key but sincere Kris Allen or the flamboyant and powerful Adam Lambert. ""American Idol"" winner Kris Allen, left, and runner-up Adam Lambert say they're good friends. The vote went for Allen, and Lambert told Ryan Seacrest on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that the outcome didn't surprise him. There are no hard feelings, though. Allen, Lambert, Danny Gokey and the other seven finalists spoke of their friendship and camaraderie on ""Larry King Live."" Here is an edited transcript of the interview. Ryan Seacrest: I think the first thing you said [after being announced as the winner] was ""Adam's great."" Actually on the air, you were complimenting him at the moment you should be complimenting yourself. Kris Allen: I think that's kind of how I am. Seriously, we're really good friends and he's amazing. He's been probably the most consistent performer this year, and just overall probably one of the best performers that's ever been on the ""Idol"" stage.  Watch Kris Allen heap praise on Adam Lambert » . Seacrest: So aside from getting more votes, why do you think you won? Allen: I don't know. I think it was a combination of a lot of stuff. It was maybe, probably, a little bit of personality, a little bit of -- hopefully it was about the music, as well. I know that's not always the case on ""American Idol."" That's what I care about the most: the music and how I portray it. Seacrest: It's no secret that you're a man of faith, that you referred to the ""Christian thing,"" as it were. You didn't rely on the Christian vote. Do you think that played a part in your win, though? Allen: I hope it didn't. Because I guess me and Adam were doing an interview before the show: ""Kris, do you think you're going to get the Christian vote now that Danny's gone?"" And that was rough, that was kind of upsetting, because the show's not about religion. We're not running for president. We are there to do music and there to sing, and hopefully people vote on that. Seacrest: I've seen the show 300-plus episodes, and I know that you have to develop some sort of strategy. So what was yours? Allen: I think my strategy throughout the whole thing was, 'don't steer away from what you know how to do.' And that's just go out there and be yourself. I went out there and I played my type of music. And I really wanted to change stuff up a little bit and be kind of bold in my music choices, and just do what I believed in. Seacrest: You guys have been through it. The question everyone wants an answer to, finally I get to ask you. What kind of guy-liner do you wear? Adam Lambert: I don't know, whatever the make-up artist puts on me, you know. Seacrest: In that beat before I [announced the winner], what were you thinking? Lambert: I kind of figured, OK, it's anyone's game at this point. I knew it was going to be a close race. And actually in my head, believe it or not, I went, that's so Kris, it's so going to be Kris. I felt it. Seacrest: You're human, so you had to be let down a little bit. Lambert: You know what? I honestly mentally prepared myself for any possibility. And we kind of kept telling each other, you know, it's such an honor to be here. We had so much fun last night. And tonight we got to sing with Queen. The point is not a title. The point is the opportunity. And I feel like we got that opportunity.  Watch the shock over the ""Idol"" finale » . Seacrest: So what do you think happened with the voting? The judges called you the darling throughout the course of the season. And then you didn't get the first-place votes. What happened? Lambert: Well, I'm sure that when Danny was out of the competition, I think his fans probably would be more apt to go for Kris' style. Allen: I think a lot of people thought that too. Lambert: I wasn't worried. I just assumed that would be the case. Seacrest: Why? Lambert: Kris' appeal is more like Danny's appeal than mine. I just kind of figured. Seacrest: Does the fact that the judges pick you out early in the season hurt in the long run? Lambert: I kind of think it helped me because I think that because I'm something a little bit different, it allowed people at home to feel it was OK to root for me. Seacrest: Kris, how did you size up the rest of the competition? Allen: Well, I think Adam and Danny were, I mean, very -- I think they were the front-runners for a long time. And they're amazing. So kudos to them. I think they deserved it completely. But I never went out there to beat anyone. We talk about that a lot. Seacrest: I can't believe that totally. You never went out there to beat anyone ever? Allen: No. How do you compare me or Adam or me or Danny or me or Matt or me or Allison? Seacrest: I've done the show for eight seasons and we've never seen anyone quite like Adam. That's great. That's the beauty I think in the show. It can continue to reinvent itself with the contestants. Lambert: That's why I felt it wasn't a competition thing. I knew it was apples and oranges. The people are like, I like that guy, I like that guy, or I like that girl. To me, it was like, go out there and do your best. That was the goal for me every week. Do something new, do something new to get people talking.  Watch the ""Idol"" finalists and Paula Abdul dish » . Seacrest: Kris, how did you feel about the love Adam was getting from the judges during the season? Allen: I thought he deserved it. I think he's amazing. I think he was probably one of the most original and one of the most -- seriously, one of the best singers that's been on ""American Idol"". Lambert: This is why we're friends. It's real. Seacrest: Let me ask you this: The speculation about your sexuality, do you think that had anything to do with coming in second place? Lambert: No, I think if anything, I think it -- I think my lifestyle is just I'm different. I'm a little bit -- I'm not your typical guy next door. The guy next door versus the guyliner. Sexuality aside, I think it more had to do with maybe my appearance and what songs I gravitated toward and my performance style. I think that had more to do with it. Seacrest: Kris, when I asked the question, you were nodding your head, why? Allen: Because I agree with him. It's not about who he is or who I am. It's about -- what we want, we want it to be about the music, you know?","Winner Kris Allen calls runner-up one of the best performers ever on show .

"(CNN) -- Cyclist Lance Armstrong said Thursday the surgery to repair his broken collarbone proved to be more complex than doctors originally anticipated and that he will take his recovery ""day by day."" Cyclist Lance Armstrong needed 12 screws to repair his broken collarbone. ""I thought everything went very smooth,"" he said in a video to his supporters about Wednesday's three-hour operation. Doctors in Spain, where Armstrong injured himself Monday when he fell during a race, initially thought he had suffered a simple fracture. However, additional X-rays and CT scans in Austin, Texas, where he lives, proved otherwise. ""They realized that the collarbone is actually in quite a few pieces,"" said the 37-year-old cyclist, who pointed to an X-ray of a 4- to 5-inch steel plate held in place by a dozen 1-inch screws, intended to stabilize it. ""That should keep things together,"" he said. ""Ultimately, that will have to come out, but for now, it's necessary.""  Watch how Armstrong ""tweets"" from hospital » . Armstrong said he felt ""very lucky, very blessed"" that, in almost 20 years of professional cycling, he has rarely crashed. ""We don't know how my recovery will go, we'll just take it day by day and ultimately get back on the bike and try to sort things out."" Armstrong's remarks came a day after his surgeon, Dr. Douglas Elenz, told reporters that the cyclist will require two to three months of healing. The four breaks ""made treatment more challenging, but we're confident that the treatment performed today is going to be successful,"" Elenz said. During the next week, Armstrong ""will need to take it easy"" to ensure the wound does not become infected, the doctor said. After his wound has healed, Armstrong will begin using an exercise bike to train his lower body, ""but we won't let him do a whole lot with his upper extremities,"" Elenz said. ""After several weeks, we can take his training to the street, but we will need to take that day by day and week by week."" He said that, over the longer term, he will be looking for evidence that Armstrong is laying down new bone, that the plate is stable, that the athlete's arm is strong and that his motion is fluid. Armstrong, riding for Team Astana, crashed about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the end of the first stage of the five-day Vuelta Ciclista a Castilla y Leon race.  Watch Armstrong's crash » . Armstrong announced last year that he was returning to competitive biking and would use the Spanish race as a warm-up for the Tour de France, which he won seven times before retiring in 2005. He also had planned to race May 9-31 in the Giro d'Italia, one of Europe's most prestigious and grueling stage races. This would have been the second comeback of his career. His first came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival.","Lance Armstrong's broken collarbone was worse than doctors expected .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A police officer chasing a theft suspect was fatally shot Thursday night by another officer after he failed to drop his weapon when ordered to, authorities said. Officer Omar Edwards, 25, was not wearing a bulletproof vest and did not fire a shot, authorities say. Authorities said Officer Omar Edwards, 25, was shot three times. The incident is under investigation. Edwards was in plainclothes and carrying a handgun as he chased the suspect past a police car. Authorities said the officer who shot him said he didn't realize Edwards was a police officer. Edwards had just left the Housing Bureau Station House on East 124th Street, said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly at a news conference Friday. As Edwards approached his vehicle, he saw a man rummaging through it. Edwards took out his gun -- a Smith and Wesson 9 mm -- and chased the alleged thief, 43-year-old Miguel Santiago, said NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Meanwhile, a police cruiser with a sergeant and two officers, including Officer Andrew Dunton, had just turned onto 125th Street from 1st Avenue. Santiago ran in front of the unmarked vehicle as it approached halfway up the block and the vehicle stopped. The officer in the front passenger seat got out of the vehicle and shouted for Edwards to stop running and drop his weapon. According to Kelly, the officers reported that, after the command was given, Edwards turned toward Dunton with his gun in his hand.  Watch Commissioner Kelly describe the shooting » . Dunton fired his Glock 9 mm six times, hitting Edwards three of those times -- once in the left arm, once in the left side and once in the back, according to police. Emergency crews responding to the scene found Edwards wearing a police academy T-shirt under his clothes and found his police shield and ID in his front left pants pocket, according to Browne. Edwards, who lived in Brooklyn, was recently married and had two small children, according to CNN affiliate WABC-TV in New York. On Friday, his relatives remembered him as a good person who achieved what he set out to do. ""He was a wonderful, wonderful child from when he was small,"" his father, Ricardo Edwards, told WABC. ""His desire was always to be a policeman and to play football,"" his uncle, Jerome Harding told the New York TV station. ""And he did accomplish both, because he plays for the Police Department."" Edwards was pronounced dead at Harlem Hospital at 11:21 p.m. Thursday, according to Kelly. ""Tragic accidents like this are another reminder of the dangers our police officers often face as they keep our city the safest big city in the nation,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday. ""Rest assured we will find out exactly what happened here, see what we can learn from it so it may never happen again. All the city's prayers are with Omar Edwards and his family."" Five eyewitnesses, along with 20 people who reported hearing gunshots, were interviewed by police. The officer who fired the shots has 4½  years' experience, authorities said. The officers involved have been placed on administrative duties while the shooting is investigated. Police later arrested the alleged thief on suspicion of breaking into Edwards' car.","Authorities: Omar Edwards, chasing a suspect, was fatally shot by another officer .

"(CNN) -- Internet sensation Susan Boyle came up short, coming in second during ""Britain's Got Talent"" finale on Saturday. Fans cheering on Susan Boyle react after she comes in second during ""Britain's Got Talent."" Boyle was upset by winner Diversity, a 10-person dance group from Essex and East London, England, ranging in age from 12 to 25 years old. The group won 100,000 British pounds ($161,000) and will perform for Queen Elizabeth II in the Royal Variety Show. ""The best people won,"" Boyle said. The dancers appeared shocked Saturday when it was announced that they had won. The group was formed in 2007, and in the same year won the United Kingdom Dance Championships. The group's choreographer ""tries to create a dance style that is eye-catching and entertaining"" and uses films such as 2007's ""Transformers"" for inspiration, the show's site said. Boyle wowed the crowd Saturday night with an encore performance of the song that first made her so famous around the world -- ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" from the musical ""Les Miserables."" After her performance Saturday, the crowd and judges gave Boyle, who wore a floor-length gown, a standing ovation.  Boyle finishes second » . ""You had the nerve to come back here tonight, face your critics and beat them,"" judge Simon Cowell told her. ""You did it."" Boyle had vowed to leave the television show before the finale, after a hectic week, but recanted and performed at the finale Saturday. The 48-year-old Scottish singer wowed audiences and judges during her audition in April when she belted out ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Her performance earned her a string of global television appearances. During the semifinals Sunday, she started off by missing the first note of her performance of ""Memory"" from the musical, ""Cats.""  Watch Boyle's semifinal performance » . She redeemed herself to earn a standing ovation and a spot in Saturday's finale. The global fame and the ""odd bit of negative press"" in the past week have been too overwhelming for her, judge Piers Morgan told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Friday. ""She's just had a pretty rough week because I think the full enormity of what has happened to her is beginning to hit home,"" Morgan said. ""Earlier this week, she had a lot of tears. ... At one stage, she was going to leave the show. So, fortunately, we've calmed everything down.""  Watch how Boyle may be feeling the pressure » . Boyle said that that she has put the tumultuous week behind her and is getting ready for the finale. ""It's all I've been thinking about,"" she said on the show's Web site. ""I'm not going to throw away my big chance now."" ""Britain's Got Talent"" defended Boyle on its Web site, saying that media reports of an emotional outburst ""have been taken out of context."" The unemployed charity worker has inspired millions in the face of pop music's penchant for pre-processed princesses. Before she sang during her audition, the unassuming single woman with a loose mop of curly hair drew snickers from the audience, including notoriously hard-to-please judge Simon Cowell. The scowls and eye-rolling were replaced by wild cheers as soon as she sang the first line. Cowell later apologized for poking fun at her during the auditions stage. ""You are one special lady,"" he said last week. ""You really are."" Reporters made their way to her quiet home in Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland, much to Boyle's great surprise. ""I keep my feet firmly planted on the ground, because you have to,"" Boyle told CNN last month. Asked what has been the most surprising change since her audition, she responded simply -- ""The way everyone seems to have embraced me. The way they seem to have apparently fallen in love with me.""","NEW: 10-person dance group Diversity seemed shocked to win ""Britain's Got Talent""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- It was a typical November day in 1971 when an eighth-grader left her house in a sleepy New Hampshire town with her pet dog, Tasha, in tow. Kathy Gloddy was found murdered a mile from where she was last seen. The German shepherd returned home that day without its 13-year-old master, Kathy Gloddy. To her family's horror, the little girl's body was found the next day, three miles from her home. She had been beaten, raped, strangled and run over by a car repeatedly until she was dead. Her body was found clothed only in her kneesocks. At the time, police had several possible suspects, but not enough evidence for an arrest, said Sgt. Scott Gilbert of the New Hampshire State Police. In 2006, Gilbert said, Kathy's body was exhumed in search of further clues, but authorities were unable to obtain forensics from the remains. Kathy's family asked private investigator Tom Shamshak to aid in the investigation and he agreed to volunteer his services. So far, investigators have only been able to piece together a timeline of the day Kathy went missing.  Watch an update on the case » . It is believed that she left her family's home at 5 p.m. to go to a convenience store, where she bought ice cream and potato sticks. Soon after leaving the store, she was spotted at Franklin High School, where one of her older sisters was attending a banquet. It is unclear where Kathy went next, but what is known is that later that evening her dog returned home acting frantic and anxious, family members said. ""When Tasha came home without Kathy, we were worried,"" said Kathy's sister, Janet Young. ""And then the dog was running around in circles, acting crazy and pawing at the door as if looking for Kathy. We always came home when we said we would and never stayed out late worrying our parents."" Private investigator Shamshak said he believes the killer may not have been a stranger. ""This kind of brutality and rage-driven crime can only come from someone that knew her or her family,"" he said. Jim Conrad, a former New Hampshire State Police trooper who worked on the case, said Kathy was found in the woods not far from a small gravel road near a popular swimming hole in Franklin, New Hampshire. Investigators believe the area -- which is only one mile from where she was last seen at the high school -- was merely a dumping site for the body and not the actual crime scene. ""One of the things my team is working on is trying to get the post-mortem DNA evidence collected by the forensic pathologist who examined her,"" Shamshak said. While there is not a lot of evidence left, it is the one piece of evidence the family hopes could link potential suspects to Kathy's murder. ""We have waited so long for justice and closure,"" said Karen Beaudin, another of Kathy's sisters. Gilbert said there are at least two persons of interest authorities have focused on and both were acquainted with Kathy Gloddy and her family. Gilbert said police thought they'd caught a break in 2004 when convicted sex offender Edward Dukette, who served time in a Florida prison for raping and nearly killing a young girl, unexpectedly came forward to police claiming he had key information about Kathy Gloddy's murder. Dukette was a former neighbor of the Gloddys and had been evicted from the multiple-family dwelling eight months before Kathy's murder. Gilbert was one of several investigators who traveled to Florida to question Dukette, but the potential suspect recanted his earlier statements and refused to speak further with officials. The Gloddy family and Tom Shamshak have said they believe there is more than one person responsible for Kathy Gloddy's murder. The family is organizing a reward fund in conjunction with the Carole Sund Foundation. Anyone who has information that could lead to the arrest of the individuals responsible for Kathy Lynn Gloddy's murder is asked to call the New Hampshire State Police Crime Unit tip line at 603-271-3636.","Teen girl found wearing only socks after being raped, murdered .

"(CNN) -- Thomas the Tank Engine, whose television adventures on the fictional island of Sodor have delighted children around the world for years, is now on a real-life mission to help kids with autism. Thomas the Tank Engine is part of a new online game to help  autistic children recognize different emotions. The steam locomotive and his friends are the stars of a new game in Australia, designed to help autistic children recognize emotions. Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect), a nonprofit that provides services to people diagnosed with the developmental disorder, unveiled the game on its Web site Tuesday. The game asks players to recognize which engine has a sad face, or which is happy or angry. Children with autism often have a difficult time distinguishing different facial expressions. Each time a child plays the game, he/she is presented with a different sequence of emotions. In doing so, the game takes advantage of the single-mindedness of autistic children to assist in their development. ""It's a great way to help develop social and communication skills,"" said Anthony Warren of Aspect. A study conducted in the United Kingdom found that autistic children were far more fascinated by the television series, ""Thomas and Friends,"" than they were with other fictional characters. The study, by the National Autistic Society, summarized that the show held such appeal because of the clear facial expressions of the characters, the pacing of the program and the easy-to-follow story lines. ""We got those results down here, and we thought, how could we leverage that strength and give a little back to the community?"" said Tom Punch with Haven Licensing, the company that handles licensing for the characters in Australia. Warren said one of the reasons Thomas is particularly stimulating and motivating for children with autism is that it's very predictable. ""Children can understand the clear visual messages -- the big smile on the front of the engine,"" he said. ""The messages it communicates are very concrete, not abstract. And the emotions are primary emotions. It's uncomplicated."" Autism is a developmental disorder that affects physical, social and language skills. It usually appears before age 3, though the earliest signs are subtle. More doctors and researchers are referring to ""autism"" as ""autisms,"" because each child's case is different, as are the causes, helpful therapies and potential treatments. The Australian nonprofit unveiled the game this month to coincide with Autism Awareness Month in that country. After all, as the show's theme song attests: ""Red and green and brown and blue; They're the really useful crew.""","Online game uses Thomas the Tank Engine to help autistic children .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Smoking in youth-rated movies has not declined despite a pledge two years ago by Hollywood studios to encourage producers to show less ""gratuitous smoking,"" according to an anti-smoking group. The American Medical Association Alliance has been trying to get movie studios to make smoking-free films. The American Medical Association Alliance, pointing to research that big-screen smoking leads teens to pick up the tobacco habit, called for an R rating for any movie with smoking scenes. The head of the group that gives U.S. movies their ratings, however, said the smoke has been clearing from youth-rated movies, a result of the film industry's sensitivity to the issue. The alliance, the medical association's advocacy arm, launched a summer campaign this week aimed at publicly shaming studios into making smoke-free films. ""Research has shown that one-third to one-half of all young smokers in the United States can be attributed to smoking these youth see in movies,"" said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, head of the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. Fielding cited another study that he said ""found that adolescents whose favorite movie stars smoked on screen are significantly more likely to be smokers themselves and to have a more accepting attitude toward smoking."" The Motion Picture Association of America, the industry group that issues ratings and parental guidance for U.S. films, added smoking scenes as a factor in ratings two years ago, but Fielding said it has not made a difference. ""In all, 56 percent of the top box office movies with smoking released between May 2007 and May 2009 were youth-rated films -- G, PG or PG-13,"" he said. Joan Graves, who chairs the Motion Picture Association's movie rating committee, offered her own statistics, based on all of the 900 films rated each year, not just the top movies included in Fielding's numbers. The association has given no G ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking, Graves said. Overall, 55 percent of the  movies rated in the past two years showed some smoking, but 75 percent of those with smoking scenes were given R ratings, Graves said. Twenty-one percent were rated PG-13 and the remaining 5 percent were PG, she said. A G movie is deemed suitable for all audiences, while a PG rating is a signal to parents that a film may include some material they might consider inappropriate for children. PG-13 indicates a stronger warning that some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. No one under 17 can be admitted to see an R movie without a parent or guardian. American Medical Association Alliance President Sandi Frost used as her chief example of a movie with ""gratuitous smoking"" this month's blockbuster ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which was rated PG-13 ""for intense sequences of action and violence, and some partial nudity."" ""Millions of children have been exposed to the main star of the film, Hugh Jackman, with a cigar in his mouth in various scenes,"" Frost said. ""I'm willing to bet that not one child would have enjoyed that movie or Mr. Jackman's performance any less if he hadn't been smoking."" A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox, the studio responsible for the Wolverine movie series, said Jackman's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes. In one scene, the cigar is shot out of his mouth, prompting Jackman's Wolverine character to suggest its loss would lead to clean living -- an anti-smoking statement -- the studio spokesman said. He said that while the Wolverine character has a cigar in his mouth in almost every panel of the comic book series, producers made ""a conscious decision"" to limit the cigar in the movie. The American Medical Association Alliance, hoping to draw studio executives' attention, hired a mobile billboard to drive around the major studios this week. ""The billboard shows a teenage girl asking the question, 'Which movie studios will cause me to smoke this summer?' "" Frost said. The alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count ""how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to G, PG and PG-13 audiences,"" she said. ""At the end of the summer, whichever studio has delivered the most tobacco impressions to youth audiences will be named in a billboard that will run outside of their headquarters,"" she said. Motion Picture Association of America spokeswoman Angela Martinez said the group ""is very sensitive to the concerns of parents about the purpose of the rating systems."" ""It's reflective of society,"" Martinez said. ""It's really a tool for parents to help determine what their kids see."" They began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as ""a reflection of changes in society and health concerns,"" she said. ""Smoking is rated like all the other factors, including violence and sex,"" she said. Fielding said it should be absolute -- and not just a factor. ""Any movie with smoking should be rated R,"" he said. ""And if they worry about an R rating hurting their profits, then they should work with studios to remove smoking from films that hurt youth."" Graves, whose committee makes the decisions, indicated such a zero-tolerance policy would not be accepted.","American Medical Association Alliance wants films with smoking to be rated R .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Music producer Phil Spector was sentenced Friday to the maximum sentence of 19 years to life for the murder six years ago of actress Lana Clarkson. Phil Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict. That means Spector, 69, would be 88 before he would be eligible for parole. Slumped, stone-faced and wearing a dark suit and bright red tie, he sat silently throughout his sentencing by Judge Larry Paul Fidler. Spector's lawyer gave a $17,000 check to Donna Clarkson, the victim's mother, to pay for her funeral expenses -- part of the court-ordered sentence. ""All of our plans together are destroyed,"" the mother said, reading a statement on behalf of her family. ""Now, I can only visit her at the cemetery."" Fidler denied a motion for a new trial by defense attorney Doron Weinberg, who said he would file an appeal. ""The evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty for the simple reason [that] he did not kill Lana Clarkson,"" Weinberg said.  Watch Spector receive his sentence » . ""Obviously, he's not very happy,"" Spector's wife, Rachelle, told reporters about her husband. ""I'm going to stand by him and get him out of that awful place so he can come home where he belongs."" Clarkson, 40, was found dead -- slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth -- in February 2003.  View a timeline of the case » . Spector's trial, which began in October, ended last month when jurors deliberated for 30 hours and then announced a guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge. Fidler had ruled jurors also could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict after 15 days of deliberations. Jurors then were deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction. Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long ""pattern of violence"" involving firearms. ""This was not an isolated incident,"" Fidler said, noting Spector's two firearms-related convictions from the 1970s. ""The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that."" In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector ""a very dangerous man"" who ""has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth."" Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out. Do pointed out to jurors, however, that Clarkson had bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something he said a suicidal woman would not have done. A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict. ""This entire jury took this so seriously,"" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that ""it's tough to be in a jury,"" because another person's life is in the jury's hands. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie ""Barbarian Queen"" and appeared in many other films, including ""Deathstalker,"" ""Blind Date,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and the spoof ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and testified that he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, ""I think I killed somebody."" Spector's professional trademark was the ""Wall of Sound,"" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called ""little symphonies for the kids"" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" and the Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."" Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, ""Let It Be,"" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year. That was one of two Grammy Awards won by Spector, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. He stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.","NEW: Music producer sentenced for 2003 slaying of Lana Clarkson .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It probably would have been just another ho-hum city council budget meeting. Except that the leader of Atlanta's police union, and second-highest ranking member of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, said he wanted to beat Atlanta's mayor with a bat. ""I want to beat her [Mayor Shirley Franklin] in the head with a baseball bat sometimes when I think about it,"" Sgt. Scott Kreher said into a microphone earlier this month in an apparent off-hand remark during a presentation he was giving to the council. Within days, the 17-year department veteran was suspended. Kreher said the ""it"" that made him want to club the mayor was that, despite repeated complaints, the police union contends the city is not honoring workers' compensation claims for cops whose careers ended when they were seriously injured on the job. Franklin, one of the nation's high-profile mayors, told CNN on Tuesday that the officers' complaints are a ""separate issue"" from Kreher's comments. ""Some people think I'll just shake it off,"" she said of the sergeant's threat. ""I can't shake off an officer at City Hall -- not in his shower or in his front yard, but in official capacity -- threatening to hit me in the head with a bat. That is a severe act of violence. When you hit someone with a bat, you intend to kill them."" The police officers union called a news conference Thursday, in part, to defend Kreher, who's their second-highest ranking member. Three officers in wheelchairs were there, at times crying, their voices raised, as they told their stories of being shot on duty and paralyzed for life. They say they've made repeated calls for months to city officials to get help with their medical claims and have been ignored. They are part of a group of officers alleging that NovaPro, a San Diego-based private insurance company, has refused or made it difficult for them to get the medication they need to alleviate pain and repair or replace medical equipment. ""I've been calling the mayor's office for more than a year, and no one has called me back or I've been told to talk to another department. Kreher called me back the same day,"" said Ryan Phinney, a 43-year-old paraplegic whose squad car was T-boned in 1989. He said he suffered with kidney stones, made more painful due to his paralysis, because NovaPro either ignored or rejected his claims for months. ""Kreher was defending us against people who refused to listen, and that is so offensive. It's no wonder he got upset,"" Phinney said. The city used to provide its own services, but ""there were concerns about internal management,"" Franklin's office explained to CNN, so it began contracting in 2004 with NovaPro. The police union complained for months about the company. Atlanta officials this month renewed the city's agreement with NovaPro for $3.7 million over three years, saying no other company they're aware of was in position to do a better job. Russ Whitmarsh, chief operating officer of NovaPro, referred all questions about the officers' allegations to city officials. Mayor Franklin's spokesperson issued this statement to CNN: . ""We are aware of the complaints of the five injured former Atlanta police officers. We greatly respect the service of these officers on behalf of Atlanta and the sacrifice they have made. The City of Atlanta has worked and will continue working with the employees' attorneys to address their current complaints. We take that responsibility and obligation seriously and intend to address every complaint within the framework of the Workers' Compensation Act."" A few days after the bat comment, Kreher apologized to Franklin in a letter, which was published on the union Web site. He called his remark ""inexcusable,"" explaining that it sprung from ""frustration and anger.""","Atlanta police union head says he got frustrated at city meeting .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- A man ""angered"" by Manchester United's defeat to Barcelona in the final of the Champions League killed four people when he drove a minibus into a crowd celebrating the Spanish side's victory, police in Nigeria have told CNN. Barcelona fans celebrate in the city's Las Ramblas thoroughfare early Thursday morning. Ten people were also injured in the incident in the town of Ogbo, where the driver was subsequently arrested, a Port Harcourt Police spokesperson said. ""He was displaying his anger at his team losing the match. The driver had passed the crowd then made a U-turn and ran into them,"" spokesperson Rita Inomey-Abbey said. Both Manchester United and Barcelona have a large fan base across the African continent, with millions tuning in to watch European football on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, more than 100 people were arrested in Barcelona city center in the early hours of Thursday morning following the Catalan team's 2-0 victory in Rome in the final of Europe's top club competition. Police arrested 119 young people after violence flared at a special celebration party in Place de Catalunya near the Las Ramblas thoroughfare, while 238 people suffered minor injuries. City officials estimated the damage at up to 100,000 euros ($140,000) as the youths attacked police with bottles and damaged shops, parks and public utilities such as lamp-posts. The trouble took some of the gloss off the achievement of Barcelona, who became the first team to win the Champions League, Spanish League and Spanish Cup titles in one season. Manager Josep Guardiola led the club to glory in his first season in charge, ending a period of three years without a trophy.","Man drives minibus into a crowd celebrating Barcelona's Champions League win .

"(CNN)  -- It is a boarding pass unlike any other. It's a memory of a day that nearly was his last on earth. US Airways passenger Barry Leonard now has the other half of his boarding pass from the fateful flight. When a FedEx package arrived at Barry Leonard's home recently, he had no idea it contained items from his flight that ended up in the Hudson River. Leonard was seated at the front of US Airways Flight 1549, and when pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger amazingly landed the plane in the river, Leonard left everything he had behind and dove into the frigid water. He thought all he had left from that January day were the clothes he had on, including a pair of jeans he still wears. But recently the package with most of his left-behind belongings showed up at his Charlotte, North Carolina, home. ""Everything from the Wall Street Journal of that day to my W-2 form that I didn't even realize was in this package,"" he says. ""You know my briefcase that I'd had for decades, it was all of those things.""  Watch as Leonard brings out the items recovered from the water » . As he showed CNN the contents he discovered another item -- a memorable slip of paper. ""This is actually the other part of my boarding pass from January 15. As you can see here January 15, flight 1549 and my seat number 1C,"" he says. To help return personal items to its passengers, US Airways hired Global-BMS, a Texas-based company that recovers and restores items from large disasters. Global-BMS sorted through nearly 30,000 items from the flight, cleaning them in a slow, tedious process that often involved freeze-drying items to preserve them while they waited to be processed. ""Passengers' emotional ties to their possessions because of a traumatic incident like this, it's highly emotional. So we just want to make it available,"" Mark Rocco, a senior vice president of Global-BMS, tells CNN. Some of the items that were returned to the 150 travelers were unusable after being submerged, especially electronic items like headphones and music players. But for a lot of folks, personal effects show a little damage but are still good. Vicki Barnhardt tried on her running shoes, and though they were a little tight at first, she wears them now when she goes jogging in Huntersville, North Carolina. She tells CNN that she evacuated the plane only with her cellphone, leaving behind her purse,  her wallet, driver's license, some flash drives and other items. She got most of her possessions from the plane back -- a coat, a pair of gloves and her cash are still missing -- and the items in the boxes seem in pretty good shape. The flash drives still work, though you can see some ""corrosion"" on them. She also got back a three-ring binder, and all her notes are still readable. Maryann Bruce found her diamonds in the parcel that was returned to her in Cornelius, North Carolina. It brought back memories of the landing in the river and made her thankful to be alive. ""I just focused on wow, you know, I got all this stuff back,"" she says. ""I can't believe I got all this stuff back, and I'm here to get the stuff back, versus the alternative where they would've been giving it to my loved ones. I didn't relive the anguish; I relived the 'Wow, I'm here to get it.' ""","US Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River on January 15 .

"(CNN) -- Millions of people around the world have taken part in ceremonies marking the 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement. Scouts renewed their promise to build a tolerant and peaceful society. Dawn celebrations involving 28 million young people took place across the globe, from Ecuador to Bhutan. In southern England, 40,000 young people from around the globe gathered to take part in the largest ever 12-day world Scout Jamboree. The island where the movement was born, Brownsea Island off the coast of England, has been the focus of celebrations, with 300 scouts from more than 160 countries attending a commemorative camp. It was on that site that Scouting founder Robert Baden-Powell held an experimental camp for 20 boys, following his experiences in the Army during the Boer War. The movement requests its members, boys and girls from the age of six, to uphold values such as trustworthiness, loyalty and to ""do their best"". Scouts from countries including the UK, Lebanon, Nepal, Rwanda, Serbia, Libya and Argentina, displayed their flags on the island, before taking part in a sunrise ceremony. In Romania, scouts formed a human chain around the Parliament building in the capital Bucharest to express how young people will play a role in the country's future. In Namibia, Africa, around 1,000 scouts cooked breakfast over a camp fire, and groups from Malawi camped at the top of Mulanje mountain. The Taj Mahal in India, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Sydney Opera House in Australia also witnessed sunrise ceremonies. The small gathering at Brownsea Island led the rest of the globe in renewing their Scouting promise to build a tolerant and peaceful society. A speech written by Baden-Powell during the first scout camp was also read out to the group. It includes a call for peace, comradeship and cooperation over rivalry between ""classes, creeds and countries which have done so much in the past to produce wars and unrest"". Alistair, 16, from Manchester, at the Brownsea Island ceremony, said: ""It has made me think how one man has changed the world. ""It is one world, one promise. We are all here as peace ambassadors. We are the next generation. We are the ones bringing peace forward into the world,"" he told the Press Association. Ana Mejia, 14, from Honduras, added: ""It doesn't matter what our nationality, our religion, our color, we are a family and we have to support each other.

"NEW YORK -- Talking excitedly and pacing the front of her classroom, Molly Greer engages her students. ""What are different paces you can go when you're reading aloud? Christina?"" Molly Greer, in her New York classroom, says she now wants to make teaching her career. ""Low."" ""Okay, low or soft, yes."" On the first day of school, most of the kids in Greer's eighth-grade class could not read at a sixth-grade level. With summer almost here, it's a totally different story for these kids, who according to their school are expected to read at or near grade level. ""It is an incredible thing for these students."" Greer graduated with honors from the University of Wisconsin. She arrived at PS 212, the multicultural magnet school in the Bronx, New York, two years ago with a degree in political science and a desire to change the world. ""When I found out about Teach For America,"" she said, ""I realized that teaching would be such an incredible way to make an impact."" Teach For America is like a local Peace Corps serving some of the country's poorest public schools in inner cities and in rural areas. It has grown every year since its inception in 1990, sending 20,000 college graduates into the nation's neediest classrooms for a two-year commitment. This year, amid a tight job market, it is more popular than ever. According to the organization's Web site, their teachers get paid the same salary and benefits as beginning teachers in their area and are paid by the local school district. About 35,000 college seniors applied for the 2009 school year, a 42 percent jump from last year. ""We had less competition from Wall Street firms, banks and places like that. It just led a lot of students to really think about what they wanted to do and how they could make an impact,"" said Kevin Huffman, executive director of Teach For America. ""Eleven percent of the entire Ivy League senior class applied to join, 20 percent of African-American seniors at Ivy League schools, 8 percent of the University of Michigan and University of North Carolina,"" Huffman said, ""just an incredible outpouring of interest by people competing to teach in low-income communities."" David Stanley went through the program and now recruits for Teach For America. He sees education as this generation's civil rights issue and says there is a direct correlation between the program's popularity and President Obama's call to service. ""With Obama talking about the need for people with talent to go into public education, and the fact that people are still really frustrated that we live in a country where 90 percent of kids in low-income communities don't go to college, and that the best way we can predict the number of prisons we're going to have to build in 25 years is by looking at third-grade reading skills, and so at this particular moment in time, I think it's really about getting our very best and asking them to go to the root of the problem, and the root of the problem is education."" This year, Teach For America will place its largest corps ever. About 4,100 high achievers from the nation's top colleges will head to classrooms in 34 regions across the country, teaching in places like Boston, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Nashville, Tennessee; and in more rural areas such as South Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta. But schools in Appalachia and elsewhere desperately need help. Huffman said, ""Districts across the country are facing the same economic pinch that many businesses are facing. And there are just fewer positions across the country available for teachers."" Which is why a teachers union says those positions should go to career teachers, not inexperienced recruits who may stay only the required two years. ""It's very hard to justify laying off teachers who have given service to a school system and then turn around and bring in new teachers,"" argued John Wilson of the National Education Association, the nation's largest professional employee organization for the advancement of public education. Besides the matter of taking away potential jobs from career teachers, unions question whether these young recruits have the right credentials and experience to handle tough classrooms. ""When you're assigning these teachers to the highest poverty schools, the most challenging schools, these children need the most experienced, the most prepared teachers, and they're not getting them,"" Wilson said, ""and that's quite a disadvantage."" Teach For America maintains that its members go through a rigorous five-week training camp and that while on the job, many pursue a teaching certificate or master's degree in education. New York will be taking 330 corps members into its schools this year. Vicki Bernstein, who is in charge of teacher recruitment and quality for the city's Department of Education, says teachers coming in through alternative programs, like Teach For America, perform as well as teachers from traditional routes. ""They serve some of our highest-need children, both in terms of neighborhoods that we have difficulty attracting traditionally prepared teachers and in subject areas where we have difficulty, that teacher colleges are not preparing teachers in those areas."" The organization says two-thirds of its recruits stay in academics, like Greer, who now plans on teaching as a career. She says her experience in the classroom has been incredibly rewarding. ""When the kid makes the two years of reading growth and they have the biggest smile on their face because they achieved their goal through their own hard work,"" she said, ""that feeling that I contributed to that student is the best compliment I can get, because I know that kid is in a better place to succeed in their future.""","Teach For America places college grads as teachers in low-income schools .

"Leslie Sanchez is a Republican political strategist and co-chair of the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute (www.hapinstitute.net), a pro-business advocacy organization. She was director of the Bush administration's White House Initiative on Hispanic Education from 2001 to 2003 and is CEO of the Impacto Group, which specializes in market research about women and Hispanics. Leslie Sanchez says it remains to be seen if Sotomayor agrees with the broader Hispanic community's values. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Obama administration has no intention of pushing comprehensive immigration reform any time soon, but with his nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, the president may have found a suitable consolation prize for the Hispanic community. A prize is due. Hispanics gave 67 percent of their votes to President Obama, delivering key states like Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico to his electoral column, and sending him two new Democratic senators and three new House Democrats from those states alone. But the problem with identity politics is that not just any Hispanic will do. Obama made clear he wanted to pick a justice who would have empathy for those whose cases come before the court. As impressive as Sotomayor's life story is, it remains to be seen whether she truly has the much-talked-about ""empathy"" for Hispanic values and dreams. If Sotomayor is truly representative of our values, she will understand that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in the Hispanic community and is our best hope for moving Hispanic households solidly into the ranks of the American middle class. In a study earlier this year, HispanTelligence, the research arm of Hispanic Business magazine, confirmed that there are at least 2.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses in the U.S., generating about $388 billion in combined revenue. Empathy with the lives of millions of Hispanics today means that she must appreciate the impact of federal, state and municipal tax and regulatory schemes on individuals and small businesses alike. Her writings should reflect the view that access to the marketplace is a constitutional guarantee no less important than freedoms of speech, religion or assembly. If she understands the hopes and aspirations of the Hispanic community, she should have a record of interpreting the Commerce Clause of the Constitution in ways that encourage individual risk-taking, free enterprise and job creation, not in ways that discourage it. Likewise, Sotomayor should show evidence of being suspicious of government's power. Many Hispanics are fresh from regimes where the rule of law has been crushed or never existed; we know that with centralized power comes arrogance, and that bureaucracies inevitably become cold, callous, unyielding and corrupt. She should be imbued with a core appreciation that our Constitution establishes a government of limited, enumerated powers, and should have a record of writings and decisions that support the conclusion that she will err on the side of limiting, not expanding, the powers and influence of government. Like all other immigrants, Hispanics came here with the hope of acquiring property for themselves and their children. We treasure as sacred our own homes, farms and land, and we know there is often little practical difference between broad government restrictions on the use and enjoyment of that property and its being taken outright. As a Supreme Court justice, Sotomayor should believe, as we Hispanics do, that the Constitution affords us due process and just compensation in either case -- and that no property should be taken unless there is a legitimate public use. As everyone knows, at the core of the Hispanic experience are our families and the opportunity to freely exercise our religion. The next justice, if she is empathetic to our lives and values, will protect the sanctity of the family and of life itself. Obama's nomination of the first Latina to the Supreme Court is a historic moment that has moved each of us, but our pride will be fleeting if she doesn't really share Hispanic values. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leslie Sanchez.","Leslie Sanchez: Obama sought a high-court nominee who would show empathy .

"BENTON HARBOR, Michigan (CNN) -- Former President Bush said that if Laura Bush hadn't been his wife, he isn't sure he could have counted on her vote. Laura Bush's ""patience and her enthusiasm ... made our marriage a really good marriage,"" President Bush said. ""I can promise you that her life dream when she was growing up was not to be first lady of the United States,"" he told a Michigan audience in one of his first major domestic speeches since leaving the White House. ""Frankly, I am not so sure that if we hadn't married, she'd have voted for me,"" he joked of his wife, who was raised in a Democratic family. The high-tension atmosphere of the presidency strengthened his marriage, Bush said. ""There's a lot of pressure in the White House, as I'm sure you can imagine. Pressure sometimes can make a marriage stronger or weaker. In my case because of her patience and her enthusiasm, it made our marriage a really good marriage,"" Bush said. The pressure of the presidency, he said, weighs most on family members. ""It's much harder to be the son of the president than to be the president. And it's much harder to be the father of the president than to be the president,"" he said in a reference to his dad, former President George H.W. Bush. ""And I used to have to admonish him not pay attention to what they were writing on the editorial pages about his son. I had gone through the same agony myself. And so I am confident that the end of the presidency is a great relief because of our strong love."" Something else Bush called a great relief: having a vice president, Dick Cheney, who had no plans to run for the top spot. ""I was pleased to have someone serve as my vice president who was not running for president, because someone who is running for president, at times, will try to distance themselves,"" Bush said. ""If things got tough, [he] could be one of the first persons off the ship, and that would be really unpleasant in the White House."" Bush said he wasn't surprised to lose public support for some of the main elements of his national security agenda. ""I was frustrated because the stakes were so high in some of the decisions that I had to make. I wasn't surprised that people would forget the feeling of how they felt after September 11. I was grateful that people were moving beyond September 11. As a president, you don't want your nation to be so worried about an attack that people don't go about their lives. ... The psychology of the nation concerned me. Which then made it harder to get people to listen to you, to some of the decisions I made."" The fact that Americans tuned out media coverage of the risk of terrorism wasn't surprising to him either, he said; he ignored most news coverage himself. ""The truth of the matter is, I never watched the nightly news, because it was predictable, I thought. Nor did I ever pay attention to the editorial pages, good editorials or bad,"" he said. ""I knew what was in the news. When you're president, you can get so obsessed with this stuff that I felt it would cloud your vision. ""The truth of the matter is, there is so much attention paid to you, I thought it was important even in the toughest moments to be upbeat and not to be so worried about myself that I couldn't convey a sense of confidence."" He mused on the transition to a far calmer existence after the presidency. ""People ask, what is it like? Well, I have never stopped at a traffic light for eight years,"" he said. ""The neighborhood we live in is nice. You know, Laura bought this house sight unseen. At least she saw. I didn't. It was like a faith-based initiative."" Bush will take the stage Friday night with former President Clinton in Toronto, Ontario, for what's being termed a ""conversation.""","Ex-President Bush gives one of first major domestic speeches after White House .

"(CNN) -- Described as the largest single gathering of displaced residents in the world today, tens of thousands of civilians are seeking shelter along the Afgooye corridor outside Mogadishu, according to the United Nations. Members of the U.S. Navy take a young Somali boy to safety after rescuing him and 51 others adrift in a skiff. Fighting between government forces and Islamist militias has triggered the flight of more than 67,000 Somalis in and around Mogadishu since May 8, the U.N. refugee agency said Tuesday. Most of them are heading to the Afgooye corridor, a 30-kilometer (19-mile) stretch of ramshackle housing described by the United Nations' World Food Program as ""a nightmare."" The corridor between Mogadishu and the town of Afgooye is already home to 400,000 displaced Somalis, some of them living in huts made of twigs and branches. The clinics are already overwhelmed with malnourished and sick children. This week, Somalia's transitional president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, asked the international community ""to help Somalia defend against foreign militants who have invaded the country."" Ahmed told local journalists Monday that he feared these foreign fighters would turn Somalia into another Iraq or Afghanistan, where U.S.-led forces are fighting Islamic extremist groups. The fighting has cut supplies of ""desperately needed humanitarian aid"" to the displaced Somalis near the capital city, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ""We are starting today the distribution of aid for some 50,000 people in Afgooye corridor through our local partners in Somalia,"" the refugee office said Tuesday. ""Today's distribution will include cooking sets, plastic sheeting, blankets and mats."" The number of Somali refugees fleeing to nearby countries also continues to rise, with some 500,000 already in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Djibouti, Eritrea and Tanzania. Many Somalis have also made the dangerous journey across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. On Saturday, a U.S. guided missile destroyer rescued a group of 52 Somali men women and children -- including a woman who was eight months pregnant -- who had been stranded aboard a small skiff for nearly a week off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Navy said.  See photos of the rescue » . A helicopter based on the USS Lake Champlain happened to spot the stranded mariners, according to the vessel's commanding officer. ""It's fortunate that our helicopter was flying over the right place at the right time,"" Capt. Kevin P. Campbell said in a U.S. Navy news release. ""I'm glad we were able to be of assistance and rescue these men, women and children. Our chief hospital corpsman stated that had we not found them at the time we did, the pregnant woman may not have survived."" USS Lake Champlain has been deployed as part of the U.S. 5th Fleet's mission to patrol the Gulf of Aden region, which has been plagued by pirate attacks off Somalia's coast. ""We were very fortunate to have come across these people in the state they were in,"" said the ship's chaplain, Lt. j.g. Jarrod Johnson. ""Seeing their condition really makes your heart go out to them. You can see the relief and hope in their eyes, and hear it in their conversation.""","Fighting has triggered flight of more than 67,000 Somalis since May 8 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the first splinters of sunlight spread their warmth on the south bank of the River Thames on Thursday, it became clear that after more than a century, the vision of Victorian engineer Alexander Stanhope St. George had finally been realized. The Telectroscope lets Londoners and New Yorkers see each other in real time. In all its optical brilliance and brass and wood, there stood the Telectroscope: an 11.2-meter-(37 feet) long by 3.3-meter-(11 feet) tall dream of a device allowing people on one side of the Atlantic to look into its person-size lens and, in real time, see those on the other side via a recently completed tunnel running under the ocean. (Think 19th-century Webcam. Or maybe Victorian-age video phone.) And all the credit goes to British artist Paul St. George. If he had not been rummaging through great-grandpa Alexander's personal effects a few years ago, the Telectroscope might still exist only on paper, hidden away deep inside some old box. But fortunately, St. George could not bear that thought and thus decided he should be the one to finish what his great-grandfather had started. It was quite simply the right thing to do. Plus, it would make a pretty cool public art exhibit. Send us your videos, images or stories . During the twilight hours Tuesday, massive dirt-covered metal drill bits miraculously emerged -- one by the Thames near the Tower Bridge and the other on Fulton Ferry Landing by the Brooklyn Bridge in New York -- completing the final sections of great-grandfather Alexander's transatlantic tunnel. The drills were removed Wednesday night and replaced with identical Telectroscopes at both ends, allowing Londoners and New Yorkers to wake up Thursday, look over to the far and distant shore and stare at each other for a while (the telescope-like contraption permits visual but not vocal communication). Of course, only part of this story is true. St. George is an artist in Britain who does have a grandfather -- minus the great prefix -- named Alexander. And the trans-Atlantic tunnel is really a trans-Atlantic broadband network rounded off on each end with HD cameras, according to Tiscali, an Italian Internet provider handling the technical side of the project. As for the Telectroscope, well, it was a fanciful idea that, according to St. George, came about from a typo made by a 19th-century reporter who misspelled Electroscope, a device used to measure electrostatic charges - as Telectroscope. ""The journalist also misunderstood what it was about and wrote in the article that it was a device for the suppression of absence,"" St. George said. ""The accidental hope captured their imagination, and lots of people at the end of the 19th century thought it was a great idea."" The Telectroscope captured St. George's imagination five years ago, when he began pondering how to do a project on the childhood fantasy of digging a hole to the opposite side of the Earth. And because the artist also happens to have an expertise in Victorian chronophotography -- a precursor to cinematography -- he had a slight idea of where to look for the proper equipment. ""We all have that idea in our head if we could make a tunnel to the other side of the Earth,"" St. George said.""But we are not all crazy enough to actually try and do it."" St. George was crazy enough to actually try and do it, but he realized he could not do the digging alone. So about two years ago, he pitched the idea to Artichoke, the British arts group responsible for taking the Sultan's Elephant -- a 42-ton mechanical creature -- for a stroll through central London in 2006. The company was immediately taken by St. George's idea. ""The whole thing is about seeing what is real and what isn't real and how the world is,"" said Nicki Webb, a co-founder of Artichoke. ""Is it nighttime when we are in daytime, and does it look familiar to us or not?"" When the sun illuminated the lens of the Telectroscope next to the Thames, it was, of course, still nighttime in New York. So the screen inside the scope broadcast back only an empty sidewalk silently framed by the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. But then something miraculous occurred. A police officer and a street cleaner walked into the frame. Stopped. And waved. The Telectroscope will be on display and open to the public 24 hours a day in London and New York until June 15. Artichoke is arranging requests to synchronize special reunions between friends and family or, the company hopes, maybe even a marriage proposal.","Telectroscope allows Londoners, New Yorkers to see each other in real time .

"(CNN) -- One was the archetypal military strongman, intent on maintaining the social order and saving his country from ""catastrophe."" The other was a charismatic shipyard electrician and trade union leader who was just as determined to lead his countrymen to freedom. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Lech Walesa attend the first multi-party session of the Polish parliament in 1989. Yet nowadays Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last leader of communist Poland, and Lech Walesa both claim, in their different ways, to have played their part in setting Poland on the path to democracy. The rise of Solidarity, the union and social movement which Walesa founded among the dockers of Gdansk in 1980, was crucial to the ultimate collapse of communism in Poland and across the Soviet bloc. Feted in the West, Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 after spending nearly a year locked up as Jaruzelski clamped down on dissent, becoming a symbol of a rising tide of resentment behind the Iron Curtain. By 1989, Solidarity had become an unstoppable social movement, sweeping to victory as the communist authorities relinquished their grip on power by allowing free elections. Walesa describes the union as a screw turning in the opposite direction to the communist regime, ultimately ""destroying the engine."" ""The system was 10 times less efficient than the western system,"" Walesa told CNN, recalling his decade-long struggle. ""It paid less, life was worse. Each country enslaved by the Soviets was different and in Poland we had TV and people could travel so we knew life could be better... and we'd never given up."" But Jaruzelski still believes that without his decision to impose martial law in 1981, Poland's revolt against Soviet domination would have been as ruthlessly and violently quashed by Moscow as had those in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. ""For me personally it was a great tragedy, the consequences of which I've felt to this day,"" Jaruzelski told CNN. ""Martial law was evil. But it was less evil than the real and inevitable threat we were facing. There was a threat of an explosion -- and an explosion in Poland would have meant an explosion throughout Europe."" As a key link in the Soviet Union's chain of Eastern European satellite states, Jaruzelski believes Moscow would never have allowed Poland to break away peacefully: ""I feared a terrible catastrophe. If martial law had not happened, Poland might have been flooded by a sea of blood."" Walesa admits the threat of Soviet intervention in the early 1980s was real, but says Solidarity had already won the argument against communism by the time Jaruzelski imposed martial law. ""I knew we were not going to fight,"" he said. ""Because in Poland there were over 200,000 Soviet troops, they had nuclear arms, and they shot better than us. We could conquer them only this way: You can arrest us, but when we come out we do the same, and we will never work for communism again."" Even his arrest and imprisonment only deepened Walesa's belief that Jaruzelski's government could be toppled: ""My friends advised me to run away but I made a different decision. When they came to arrest me, I said, 'You have lost, I have won. You have just put the last nails into the coffin of communism.'"" These days Jaruzelski is no defender of the system which he served, describing communism as ""beautiful and noble, but utopian."" Yet he believes Solidarity's demands in the early 1980s amounted to an ""economic time bomb"" and that Poland was not ready for democracy at the time. ""The system was bad, I admit it today,"" he said. ""But at the time, I wasn't aware of that. Everything has to ripen -- corn, fruit, man and societies. Western countries took centuries to arrive at democracy. Except for six or seven years after World War I Poland had never been democratic so it was a difficult process."" The Polish authorities also realized the urgency of economic and political reform, Jaruzelski adds, and had already begun the process before the Round Table talks with Solidarity in 1989 that led to elections. ""It was a difficult and painful process for both sides,"" he said. ""I can talk primarily of the government side, and what huge resistance I had to overcome among the people who were in power -- in the party, in the state, the army and the security apparatus."" Both men pay tribute to outside forces which made the leap to democracy possible. For Jaruzelski, Mikhail Gorbachev's emergence in the Kremlin marked a ""breakthrough moment"" in which the threat of Soviet military intervention in Poland was lifted, and a possible end to the Cold War loomed into sight. Walesa and Jaruzelski also acknowledge the unique role of the Polish-born Pope John Paul II and the Catholic church in brokering peaceful talks between the two sides. For Jaruzelski, though, the fall of communism was not the product of Solidarity alone or a single summer of upheaval but ""a great river made up of numerous streams."" ""Nobody should monopolize that victory,"" he said. ""Because in this stream there was Gorbachev; there was Reagan and then Bush, who caused the weakening of the Soviet Union by the arms race; there was Solidarity; there was the pope, and there were also -- which I will say without humbleness -- the reformists within the authorities at the time."" Both Jaruzelski and Walesa paint themselves as reluctant leaders. Jaruzelski describes his decision to become Polish prime minister as ""one of the greatest mistakes of my life,"" while Walesa, who was elected Polish president in 1990, says it was never his wish to lead his country -- ""but who else could have done it?"" Jaruzelski remains a divisive figure in modern Poland, derided by many as a living symbol of an oppressive past and occasionally summoned to court rooms to answer charges relating to his career as a leading servant of the communist regime. ""My generation, which remembers those times and can evaluate them in a balanced way, is passing away,"" he said. ""And the new, younger generation, through school, books and TV, are being indoctrinated to be critical of martial law. Still, a large part of the society -- the majority, I think -- considers martial law to have been inevitable and justified."" Yet even Jaruzelski says Poles can be ""proud"" of their role in the downfall of communist regimes across Europe: ""The Polish elections preceded the revolutions in Hungary and in Czechoslovakia and the fall of the Berlin Wall. That impulse, that example that came from us, was of great significance and I think it is our great historical tribute."" Walesa, unsurprisingly, offers a more direct assessment: ""Poland knocked out the teeth of the Soviet bear. Once we had done that, knocking down the Berlin Wall, the Velvet Revolution, all was made possible -- but only once the bear had no teeth."" CNN's Claudia Rebaza interviewed Wojciech Jaruzelski. CNN's Fredrik Pleitgen interviewed Lech Walesa.","Former Polish leaders Jaruzelski, Walesa speak to CNN .

"(CNN) -- The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is ""pretty excited"" but a little tired. Kavya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, reacts to winning the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night. ""This has been my dream for so long; I've always wanted to win the bee,"" Kavya Shivashankar, 13, of Olathe, Kansas, told CNN. ""I was just really excited when I was able to go up and spell the last word."" The eighth-grader won $40,000 in cash and prizes for nailing the final word, ""Laodicean,"" which means lukewarm or indifferent, particularly in matters of politics or religion. This year's bee -- an event that has skyrocketed in popularity thanks to exposure on television and in movies -- started Tuesday in Washington with a record 293 spellers. Kavya endured 15 rounds. In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.  Watch the poised winner describe the thrill » . As she spelled words such as ""phoresy,"" ""hydrargyrum"" and ""huisache,"" she calmly went through the routine of asking each word's pronunciation, origin and roots before ticking their spellings off for the judges. ""I focus so much on my word; I don't really pay attention to all the cameras and photographers and all the media in front of me,"" she said Friday. Kavya's father, who is her spelling coach, would tap his foot in time as she spelled the words, and at one point he appeared so confident that he waved to someone while his daughter was in the middle of spelling a word. Second-place finisher Tim Ruiter of Reston, Virginia, bowed out after misspelling ""Maecenas,"" meaning a generous patron of the arts. Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year. ""It was such a big part of my life, and I love doing it,"" she said. However, she may someday have a new role in the competition. ""If my [little] sister gets to D.C. sometime soon, I'd really love to help and coach her,"" she said. Kavya attends California Trail Junior High School in the Kansas City suburb. Her hobbies include swimming, cycling and traditional Indian dance, according to the contest's Web site. She plans on becoming a neurosurgeon. The first National Spelling Bee took place in 1925, with five contestants.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher on Saturday denied that he is the man shown pointing at the Google Street View camera as it drove past his local pub in London last summer. Liam Gallagher says the figure captured on Google Earth outside a pub in London is not him. ""Just saw google earth apparently that's meant to be me, who ... wears legwarmers with reeboks?? Not this kid!! LG,"" he wrote on Twitter. Though available for a while in the United States, Google Street View only launched in Britain last week. As in America, the launch in Britain prompted people all over the country to try to find themselves or spot funny images and famous faces on the service. Gallagher was apparently spotted outside The Queens pub in Camden, in north London, a place he's known to frequent. The picture shows a man dressed in a dark T-shirt and long shorts sitting at an outdoor table. He points at the camera, obviously having seen the Google car and its Street View camera drive by. The service blurs people's faces so it is hard to confirm whether it is Gallagher. Though the man isn't wearing legwarmers, Gallagher is apparently talking about the man's ankle-high shoes and thick black socks.","Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher denies Google Earth appearance .

"(CNN) -- An American human rights group documenting widespread sexual violence against Darfuri women in Sudan and Chad has called for ""vigorous prosecution of rape as a war crime."" Sudanese women in a refugee camp in southern Chad in March. Physicians for Human Rights, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, issued a report Sunday ""documenting the scope and long-term impact of rape and other sexual violence"" experienced by women who fled the war-torn Sudanese region of Darfur and now live as refugees in neighboring Chad. The report -- titled ""Nowhere To Turn: Failure To Protect, Support and Assure Justice for Darfuri Women"" -- is based on interviews with 88 female refugees living in Chad's Farchana refugee camp. The study was done with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. ""Many Darfuri women refugees live in a nightmare of memories of past trauma compounded by the constant threat of sexual violence around the camps now,"" said Susannah Sirkin, the physician group's deputy director. ""Women who report being raped are stigmatized, and remain trapped in places of perpetual insecurity. There's no one to stop the rapes, no one to turn to for justice for past or ongoing crimes, and little psycho-social support to address their prolonged and unimaginable traumas."" Dr. Sondra Crosby, a Physicians for Human Rights consultant and expert in refugee trauma, said ""the atmosphere of intimidation was palpable as we listened to women describing their profound suffering and fear, and their yearning to return safely and with dignity to their former lives."" Of those refugees interviewed, ""32 reported instances of confirmed or highly probable rape"" -- 17 in Darfur and 15 in Chad, the group said. ""Among the instances of rape reported in Chad, the vast majority (10 of 11 confirmed reports) occurred when women left the camps to gather firewood."" And just over half of the 88 women interviewed -- 46 of them -- live in fear of sexual assaults around the refugee camp. The group supports the issuing of International Criminal Court warrants against the Sudanese perpetrators. The group also called for ""legal reforms in Chad to end impunity for sexual violence,"" and for ""effective psychosocial support to survivors."" And it said increased protections are needed by police and peacekeepers, including ""effective firewood patrols."" The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 after rebels in the western region of Sudan began attacking government positions. Sudan's government responded with a fierce military campaign that has led to some 200,000 deaths and forced 2 million people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.","88 Darfuri women interviewed in Chad described ""profound"" suffering and fear .

"Fourth seed Elena Dementieva avoided an embarrassing early exit when comeback queen Jelena Dokic's French Open hopes were ended by a back injury on Thursday. Jelena Dokic was left in tears after being forced to retire hurt against Elena Dementieva at the French Open. Dokic, taking part in her first French Open since 2004 following well-documented family problems, won the first set 6-2 and -- after her first break for treatment -- broke the 2004 finalist to lead 3-2 in their second round clash. But the Russian won the next two games as the tearful former world No.4 was reduced to walking pace before calling it quits. ""I went for a return and I just went down and couldn't get back up,"" she said. ""It's very painful and very disappointing because I felt as if I had the match in my hands.""

The 26-year-old's career had nosedived following her highly-publicized split from controversial mentor and father Damir. Dementieva will next play Australian 30th seed Samantha Stosur, who won her second-round match in straight sets against Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer.

Second seed Serena crushed Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-2 6-0 to set up a clash with another unseeded Spaniard, Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. Third seed Venus survived a scare against unseeded Czech Lucie Safarova before completing a match that was halted on Wednesday night due to bad light. The American saved a match point at 5-4 down in the third set before managing to hold, break her opponent and then serve out to love for a 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 7-5 success. Venus, who lost the 2002 final to Serena, will next play Hungarian 29th seed Agnes Szavay. Fifth seed Jelena Jankovic had no such troubles in beating Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia 6-1 6-2, setting up a third-round clash with unseeded Austrian Jarmila Groth. Seventh-seeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova also advanced along with Danish 10th seed Caroline Wozniacki, but 13th seed Marion Bartoli of France made a surprise exit.

"(ESSENCE) -- Two weeks ago, 3-year-old Jaquan Reed was fatally shot on Chicago, Illinois', West Side. Men participate in the Million Father March to support children going to school. While the case shook the city, such shootings involving children are no longer rare in the Windy City. Within the current academic year, 36 Chicago-area students were killed. Essence.com spoke to Phillip Jackson, a well-known political activist in the city and also founder of Black Star Project, a Chicago-based community outreach group, about what is being done to end the senseless shootings involving children. The following is an edited version of that interview: . ESSENCE: There have been so many shootings and deaths. Please tell us what's happening in Chicago? ESSENCE: Xerox names Ursula Burns CEO . Phillip Jackson: This is a national catastrophe that is happening while we as a country do nothing. We're asking for national attention. This is a pandemic. We will not be able to solve this problem in Chicago unless they can solve this same problem in Houston [Texas] and other cities.  Watch our panelists talk about the growing violence in Chicago » . ESSENCE: The nation's first black president is from Chicago. And you still do not feel like there is enough attention placed on this problem? Jackson: Newspapers from all over the world have come to our offices this past week to say, ""What is happening in President Barack Obama's backyard?"" And 75 percent of the children murdered here in Chicago happened within eight miles of President Obama's former house. So if he doesn't respond as president, and we are hoping he does, he needs to respond as a resident. ESSENCE: What has been the police response? Jackson: They've put together a 400-unit gang SWAT team. They're trying to match guns with the gangs. But with all of that they can't stop one murder because they're approaching it from the wrong way. ESSENCE: Obama's time in office . ESSENCE: What is the right way to approach it? Jackson: Instill strong families and strong communities. Build strong parenting groups. Do you know what has been the best mentoring organization in the United States of America? Street gangs. ESSENCE: In other cities, where there is a lot of gang violence, like Baltimore [Maryland], there are regular people in the community coming together and trying to fix it. What are regular people doing about this in Chicago? Jackson: First of all, they're raising their voices. Number two, they're rallying, they're marching, and they're organizing. That's what this effort is going to take. Number three, they're engaging in recreational programs. ESSENCE: Toledo cops say teen provoked them . So there is more happening at the grassroots level than at the federal level. But those people cannot succeed without support. And that's why we're asking President Obama to bring his resources. ESSENCE: What is the mind-set of Chicago youth with all of these horrendous acts of violence occurring? Jackson: Hopelessness, desperation, anger. They live in America. They see how America takes care of the whole world but won't take care of them in the communities in which they live.","Essence speaks to political activist in Chicago about children's deaths .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A crude bomb made from a water bottle was used in an explosion that damaged a Starbucks coffee shop on New York's posh Upper East Side, New York police said. Monday's explosion shattered glass at the Manhattan Starbucks coffee shop. No one was injured. The Memorial Day explosion damaged the shop, but no one was injured and no motive has been identified for the bombing. ""We believe it to be ... a six- to 10-ounce water bottle that was wrapped in black tape,"" New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told CNN on Wednesday. He said the bomb's powder may have come from fireworks components, including a fuse. The powder was placed inside the bottle in a way that made it ""more powerful,"" Kelly said. He said a forensics unit is working on finding fingerprints. The homemade bomb, which went off around 3:30 a.m., shattered glass, but no one was injured. The store was not open. Police have said the device was planted under a wooden bench outside the coffee shop. ""We have a witness who believes he saw two young people he describes as teenagers, both white males,"" the commissioner said. One is described as blond, wearing a red shirt, and the other had brown hair and wore a gray shirt. Kelly said the witness saw the two approach the Starbucks, then looked away. After the witness heard the blast, he said he saw the two young people run away from the building. Kelly said that for now, it's impossible to say whether the bombing was politically motivated. ""We don't know if they were a corporate target or somebody had a problem [with] what was going on on that corner, in general ... we're not ruling anything out."" In 1999, a Starbucks in Seattle, Washington, was vandalized during a world trade conference. In February 2008, a Vancouver Starbucks and another restaurant were damaged by an overnight explosion. New York police say they're aware of both incidents, but Kelly says it is too early to draw any conclusions.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg plans to undergo a ""precautionary"" course of chemotherapy following her surgery last month for pancreatic cancer, the Supreme Court announced Tuesday. President Obama greets Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on her arrival for his February 24 address to Congress. The treatments will begin later this month at the National Institutes of Health outside Washington, the court said. In a statement, the justice said the treatment is ""not expected to affect my schedule at the court. Thereafter, it is anticipated that I will require only routine examinations to assure my continuing health."" Ginsburg, who turned 76 on Sunday, has consistently signaled her health outlook is positive. She termed the February 5 removal of her cancer ""successful,"" and was back on the bench 18 days later when the high court resumed oral arguments. Ginsburg's post-op recovery has gone well, and doctors and the family are cautiously optimistic, court sources said. The disease was caught early and had not spread beyond her pancreas, doctors have said. ""Cancer patients with no evidence of disease after surgery but who have a statistical chance that there is microscopic spread often get chemotherapy to kill off that disease,"" explained Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Getting back into her regular routine was important to the justice, and it would help her cope with future medical treatment, sources close to her said. She successfully fought colorectal cancer a decade ago. Almost 35,000 Americans are estimated to have died from pancreatic cancer in 2008, making it the fourth leading cause of cancer death overall, according to the American Cancer Society. For all ages combined, the one-year survival rate is 24 percent; the five-year survival rate is 5 percent. The low survival rate is a result of the disease commonly going undetected until it has reached an advanced stage. Ginsburg -- the only woman on the Supreme Court -- entered a New York hospital after a CT scan in January ""revealed a small tumor, approximately one centimeter across, in the center of the pancreas,"" a previous news release said. She has kept a busy schedule, on and off the bench. Since her diagnosis, she has released three opinions, attended President Obama's February 24 address to Congress, gone to an opera production in the company of Justice David Souter, and traveled for several speeches. She told an audience last week in Boston, Massachusetts, that she had no plans to retire, but on the subject of court retirements she hinted cryptically, ""We haven't had any of those for some time, but surely we will soon."" Ginsburg, Souter and Justice John Paul Stevens frequently have been mentioned as likely to step down in the next few years. Ginsburg also said her former colleague, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- herself a cancer survivor -- had offered her some good advice. ""She said when you're up to chemotherapy, you do it on Friday, Friday afternoon.

"(CNN)  -- Arizona reported its fourth death from the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, health officials said Wednesday. The H1N1 strain is relatively mild, but it's being closely watched for mutations that might become severe. The victim was the second child in the Pima County area to die of flu complications, health officials said. The age of child who died Wednesday was not released, but the patient's health was ""medically compromised."" Earlier, officials in Cook County, Illinois, recorded their second death from H1N1. The latest victim, from suburban Chicago, died within the past couple of days and had ""significant underlying medical conditions,"" said spokeswoman Kelly Jakubek. The first fatality occurred in a Chicago resident over the weekend. That victim also had underlying medical conditions, Jakubek said. Citing family privacy, she would not reveal the victims' ages or genders. By late Wednesday, the most-recent deaths in Arizona and Illinois had not been included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's official tally of 11 U.S. deaths from the disease. They are in Arizona (three), Missouri (one), New York (two), Texas (three), Utah (one) and Washington (one). Nor did the CDC's count include two more deaths reported by the New York City Department of Health and Hygiene. The World Health Organization has counted 14,557 cases of H1N1 -- 96 of them fatal -- in 48 countries. Seasonal flu typically kills 36,000 Americans in any given year, though such cases usually have tapered off by this time of year, according to the CDC. Though the H1N1 strain is considered relatively mild, public health officials have been scrutinizing its spread since it was first identified in April in Mexico because they are concerned it could mutate and become more severe.","Arizona reports its fourth death linked to H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu .

"(CNET) -- If you want to consider a difficult computational problem, try thinking of the algorithms required to animate more than 10,000 helium balloons, each with its own string, but each also interdependent on the rest, which are collectively hoisting aloft a small house. The production team at Pixar faced many new technological challenges on ""Up,"" its tenth feature film. That was the challenge the production team at Pixar faced when it set out to begin work on ""Up,"" its tenth feature film, five years in the works, which hits theaters on Friday. There was absolutely no way the team was going to hand-animate the balloons. Not with their numbers in five-figures, and especially not when you consider that within the cluster, every interaction between two balloons has a ripple effect: If one bumped another, the second would move, likely bumping a third, and so on. And every bit of this would need to be seen on screen. In ""Up,"" the story revolves around the main character, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen, who, frustrated with his mundane life, ties the thousands of balloons to his house and sets off for adventures in South America. A small boy ends up marooned on board, and hilarity ensues. The cluster of balloons is so central to the film's branding--it's called ""Up,"" after all--that to promote the film, Pixar teamed up with two of the world's cluster ballooning experts for a nationwide tour involving a real-life flying armchair and dozens of huge, colorful balloons. ""You have a movie that's about a house that flies, which is a pretty far-fetched idea,"" said Steve May, the supervising technical director on ""Up."" ""We all know, from kids' parties, how a bunch of balloons behave, so if we could animate balloons in a realistic way, the believability that the house could fly would sell."" For May, ""Up"" producer Jonas Rivera, director Pete Docter, and the many others involved in making the film, believability was key, even within the context of a story about a flying house. And while a major part of instilling that believability must come from a well-conceived and executed story and script, the animation is no less responsible for winning over potentially skeptical audiences. Balloons, the mother of animation invention May said that the animation department at Pixar never even considered hand-animating the balloons. But even standard computer animation wouldn't be up to the task, because of the N-squared complexity involved in the thousands of interdependent balloons. Instead, the studio's computer whizzes figured out a way to turn the problem over to a programmed physical simulator, which, employing Newtonian physics, was able to address the animation problem. ""These are relatively simple physical equations, so you program them into the computer and therefore kind of let the computer animate things for you, using those physics,"" said May. ""So in every frame of the animation, (the computer can) literally compute the forces acting on those balloons, (so) that they're buoyant, that their strings are attached, that wind is blowing through them. And based on those forces, we can compute how the balloon should move."" This process is known as procedural animation, and is described by an algorithm or set of equations, and is in stark contrast to what is known as key frame animation, in which the animators explicitly define the movement of an object or objects in every frame. Procedural animation has been around for some time, but May suggested that even the most difficult uses of it in the past don't come close to what Pixar had to achieve in ""Up."" Pixar fans may remember the scenes in ""Cars"" of a stadium full of 300,000 car ""fans"" cheering on a high-speed race below, each of which was independently animated. That, too, was done with procedural animation, May said, since creating so many cars individually would have been a non-starter. But even that complex computation problem didn't approach the balloon cluster issue in ""Up"": the ""Cars"" scene involved no interdependent physics. Getting the simulator humming properly is no easy task, as one might imagine. May said it involves setting rules for how individual objects should behave, giving the computer these initial conditions, and then ""let it run."" Oddly, because the simulator does indeed run with those conditions and rules and the peculiarities of physics, the animators found themselves without precise control of what would happen with the balloons--or other objects in the film animated using these techniques. ""If the (balloon cluster) is moving too slow, we increase the amount of wind, and then run the simulator again,"" May said. ""Then maybe we turn the wind down. It's a little fun science experiment where sometimes, hopefully by the end, we're getting what we want."" Losing control of balloons Sometimes, given the vagaries of physics and chaos theory, unexpected things happen. The computer team inputs the rules and because some of the initial conditions are random, ""you get semi-random results."" One of May's favorite examples is that early in the film, when the house first is hoisted aloft by the balloons, a small group of the balloons actually broke off of the main cluster. May said that this breakaway group of balloons is actually visible--albeit very briefly--in ""Up."" Eagle-eyed moviegoers can see the escaped balloons in the upper right-hand side of the screen, he said. ""We didn't mean for that to happen,"" he said, ""but (we said) 'It's cool, let's keep it.'"" Even being able to make such choices wasn't possible at the beginning of the film's production, however. May said Pixar's physical simulator, an open-source program called ODE, couldn't initially handle the complexity of modeling the behavior of more than 10,000 balloons. ""We could handle about 500 (balloons), and we knew we needed tens of thousands,"" he said. ""We knew we needed to develop a new simulator software pipeline...to handle an order of magnitude more complex simulation."" Of course, at Pixar, adjusting to evolving computer needs on the fly is nothing new. In fact, May said the studio has done so in one form or another on many of its films. For example, he said that when the studio made ""Monsters, Inc.,"" it had to figure out how to animate the movie's monsters' fur. Similarly, when Pixar made ""Finding Nemo,"" the animators had to figure out how to simulate underwater scenes. ""We had to learn about (how light refracts under water), and murk and how particulates float under water,"" May said. And in ""Up,"" too, there were additional animation challenges. Among them were figuring out how to animate and render the feathers on Kevin, a bird that is a major character in the film, and how to make the cloth on (main character) Carl's clothes seem believable. Carl's threads were ""the hardest clothing we've ever had to animate here,"" said May, ""in part because Carl's a (small) man in an oversized suit. That was another case of (using) the physical simulation, and of setting up rules for how cloth should behave. And the looser the clothing, the more it can behave badly."" Even Carl himself presented some animation difficulties, May said, because the character's head is shaped like a cube. Like many other elements in ""Up,"" the cube-shape of Carl's face wasn't a random whim of the director. Rather, it is a story element: May explained that Carl's character is based on someone who, as a young man, was vivacious and adventurous. But as he grew older, his small house became more and more surrounded by buildings, and ""it's like his world has compressed him into a square."" Thus, a cube-like face. But May said animating his facial expressions, which must fit into this cube shape, was complicated. Smiles, for example, had to come up and wrap around his cheek. Still, for the award-winning filmmakers at Pixar, the goal is to make even the hardest animation problems look simple on the silver screen. As producer Jonas Rivera put it, ""The audience looks at (the balloon cluster) and says, 'Oh, that's pretty.' But they have no idea how much work went into it. We worked on that for over a year. (Then) the kid takes off his hat and runs his fingers through his hair. My mother will never know that took 15 people six weeks."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- River waters spread over highways and farms, towns and parks in Washington on Thursday, shutting down traffic on a 20-mile stretch of heavily traveled Interstate 5 between Seattle and Oregon and threatening the federal roadway north of Seattle. Rescue boats are sent out Wednesday in Pierce County, south of Seattle, Washington. ""If you're trying to do commerce between Portland (Oregon) and Seattle, there is no way right now,"" said Bob Calkins, a spokesman for the Washington State Emergency Operations Center in Camp Murray, near Tacoma. ""That's the major way into Washington state from Oregon."" Flooding south of Seattle near Chehalis covered parts of I-5 with 30 inches of water, prompting its closure until at least Monday, state transportation officials said. And state and local roads were also victims of the water. ""The problem is, the one real good detour is just as flooded,"" Calkins said. North of Seattle, a levee failure in Arlington brought the Stillaguamish River up to the edges of I-5, which remained open although some access ramps were closed, transportation officials said. The rain also caused Amtrak to suspend service between Seattle and Portland until Saturday, ""with no alternative transportation,"" the rail line said Thursday on its Web site. iReport.com: Are you there? Share pics, video . Across the state, a number of rivers had crested, but flooded roads remained hazardous. The risk of landslides was high, leading to the closure of all passes across the Cascades, officials said. A meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Seattle said 15 inches of rain that began Monday had ended. The rainfall swept across virtually all of the state, but its biggest effects occurred along the western half of Puget Sound, Calkins said. The swollen Puyallup River threatened the city by the same name, but Loretta Cutter, sprang into action.  Watch how Washington copes with wicked weather » . The administrator of a group home and a longtime resident there helped evacuate 47 residents from the Valley Community Inn, a home for the mentally challenged and developmentally disabled, to a shelter at a nearby church. And she made sure her husband and a grandson left their one-story rambler house and got safely situated. ""It's a situation you don't realize you are going to be in; it's always someone else,"" she said from the shelter at the Sunrise Baptist Church in Puyallup, a few miles east of Tacoma. ""It was pretty traumatizing to all of us."" Cutter is one of 40,000 western Washington state residents in at least 19 communities whom authorities asked to leave their homes Thursday amid heavy flooding along the region's rivers and streams. Only 260 of them sought shelter Wednesday night at the 39 shelters for people, Calkins said. In addition, seven livestock shelters and two pet shelters were set up, he said. Meanwhile, the torrential downpours of the past few days transformed Thursday into drizzle, common in western Washington, which typically gets less rainfall in any given year than does Miami. ""It just drizzles every day, or so it seems, whereas in Miami, when it rains, it's a bellywasher,"" Calkins said. This week's flooding was worsened by a warm spell that melted up to 7 feet of snow that had fallen around Puget Sound, he said. Health authorities have issued occasional boil-water orders, but that's not what worries Calkins. ""The larger issue is, as people go to their homes, they may be walking through floodwater that is contaminated by sewage,"" he said.","NEW: A 20-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between Seattle area and Oregon closed .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- She may have finished second, but Susan Boyle continued to make newspaper headlines in the UK Sunday following her shock defeat in the final of ""Britain's Got Talent."" Susan Boyle fans watch her perform for the final time on ""Britain's Got Talent."" ""Boyle Backlash"" said the headline in the tabloid News of the World, suggesting that the Scottish 48-year-old's alleged ""four-letter tantrum"" earlier this week had influenced millions of viewers to switch their votes to dance act Diversity. The buildup to Saturday night's live final had been dominated by reports that Boyle lost her temper in a London hotel and had even considered pulling out of the talent show finale. The Mail on Sunday said she had been been ""comforted by psychiatrists"" ahead of Saturday's final. ""They have a whole army of doctors, psychiatrists and experts all available to any contestant at any time. They have all been taking great care of Susan,"" the paper quoted ""Britain's Got Talent"" judge Piers Morgan as saying.  Watch how Boyle's rise to fame has been an emotional ride » . In Scotland, where crowds had gathered in Boyle's hometown of Blackburn in anticipation of victory, celebration parties were stopped in their tracks as the unexpected result was announced. ""Boyle foiled in final: Susan's dream is over,"" said the headline in the Sunday Mail. Earlier, the paper said, Blackburn's community center had been ""a sea of hands"" as Boyle performed her signature tune, ""I Dreamed a Dream"" from the musical ""Les Miserables."" ""They stood with tears in their eyes as Susan hit every note. Stamping and chanting her name, her fellow villagers could not have been more proud.""  Watch the dramatic end to Susan Boyle's dream » . But ""the cheers were caught in the collective gullet ... as dance troupe Diversity gatecrashed this most expectant of parties,"" the Sunday Herald reported. ""Jaws were left agape. Tears were shed. And then the supportive chanting of 'SuBo' began again."" Boyle could still be the real winner from the series, which became a global hit after clips of her audition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" racked up millions of hits on YouTube. Did Susan deserve to win? Sound Off below . ""£6M superstar"" said the Sunday Mirror, claiming that ""Britain's Got Talent"" impresario Simon Cowell plans to take Boyle across the Atlantic to ""conquer the U.S."" The News of the World upped Boyle's likely earnings on the back of ""Britain's Got Talent"" to £8 million ($13 million). On top of a multi-million dollar record deal and share of album sales, Boyle is also set to earn from a Hollywood movie of her rags-to-riches life, a book deal, and millions more from image rights, endorsements and television appearances, the paper said. In an interview with the News of the World, Cowell said Boyle could be the biggest star he had ever discovered. ""They don't care in America whether she wins a British TV show -- they care about the woman they saw singing on YouTube,"" a Cowell insider also told the paper. ""If anything, £8 million in her first year might be an underestimate."" Meanwhile, competition winners Diversity are also set to cash in on their success with a film deal and a possible slot supporting Michael Jackson when the superstar plays a series of shows in London next month, the Sunday Mirror said. The group collected £100,000 ($162,000) for winning the final and will perform in front of Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Show later this year. ""We feel electric. Words can't describe it.

"HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Reality television featuring law enforcement officers on the beat is nothing new. A show featuring a lawman who makes jailed inmates wear pink underwear and uses actors to trick suspects, however, is a new twist. Maricopa Co. Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has his own TV show, ""Smile: You're Under Arrest."" Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose showy brand of justice has raised charges of discrimination and civil-rights abuses while making him a hero among fans of his tough-on-crime attitudes -- will star in ""Smile: You're Under Arrest."" The show, which premiers this weekend on Fox Reality Channel, features Arpaio and other officers using elaborate ploys crafted by comedy writers and carried out by professional actors to arrest suspects with outstanding warrants. In one, a suspect is invited to a fake fashion shoot and told he's going to become a supermodel, according to Fox Reality's Web site. In another, a suspect is tricked into what he thinks is a job as a movie extra and, after a staged argument between the film's ""director"" and another actor, gets promoted to the starring role. ""It's kind of fun to show how stupid they are and, as I say, the looks on their face,"" Arpaio, 76, said of the suspects wanted for DUIs, drug charges, missed court dates and other offenses.  Watch Arpaio explain his methods » . But Arpaio's critics aren't amused. They say they fear the show will give the controversial sheriff positive publicity, ignoring what they call a darker side to his 16-year tenure as top lawman in the county that includes Phoenix. ""It's going to celebrate a sheriff that's frankly scaring this community, a sheriff that has seen violent crime increase significantly in his county, a sheriff that is racially profiling the Latino community, and I doubt that the show is going to reflect that,"" said Paco Fabian, spokesman for the immigrant-rights group America's Voice. In a statement on the group's Web site, Fabian calls Arpaio a ""modern day Bull Connor,"" comparing him to the public safety commissioner in 1960s Birmingham, Alabama, whose use of attack dogs and firehoses on civil rights demonstrators made him a symbol of racial intolerance. Dubbed ""America's Toughest Sheriff,"" Arpaio makes many of his county's 10,000 or so inmates live in tents. He reinstituted chain gangs -- including crews for women and juveniles -- banned smoking, coffee and movies in his jails and, most recently, moved to require all inmates with money in their jail accounts to pay for their own meals. And then, of course, there's the pink underwear. ""They were stealing the white underwear, smuggling the underwear out of the jail,"" Arpaio told CNN. ""So you know what? Give them pink. The other reason is they hate pink. Why would you give the 10,000 inmates the color they like?"" Earlier this year, the mayor of Phoenix wrote a letter to the U.S. attorney general's office, asking the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division to investigate Arpaio's aggressive illegal immigration crackdowns. Mayor Phil Brown wrote that Arpaio's sweeps show ""a pattern and practice of conduct that includes discriminatory harassment, improper stops, searches and arrests."" The letter came after Arpaio, who had already been the target of hundreds of lawsuits, launched a series of what he calls crime-suppression patrols in largely Latino neighborhoods. Critics say the patrols use racial profiling to unfairly target Hispanic drivers and pedestrians, while Arpaio says they have resulted in the deportation of hundreds of illegal immigrants, including some with criminal records. ""We are the only ones cracking down on the state's human smuggling law,"" Arpaio said. Fabian said America's Voice is considering putting pressure on companies that advertise during Arpaio's show. Either way, the series offers another moment in the spotlight for a lawman who has never shied away from it. ""I'm not going to brag,"" Arpaio said, ""but there isn't anybody in the world who doesn't know who this sheriff is."" CNN's Brooke Anderson and Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Maricopa Co., Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has own TV show .

"(The Frisky) -- There exists a school of thought that dictates if you think something catastrophic, then it won't happen. What would happen if my family died in a car accident? What would happen if my house caught on fire? ""What makes men connect with the girl of their dreams after sparking with me?"" the author asks. Two summers ago, I asked myself: Wouldn't it suck if my first love met someone unexpectedly and got over me before I could begin to move on? Thankfully, my family and my house are safe, but my feelings, my love life, and my ego still need mending. ""I met someone."" The text message appeared on the screen of my phone and I stopped walking. A group of my friends and I were leaving the movie theater, and it was as if all feelings he had for me were obliterated in one night. We broke up because he was studying in Europe. Poetically, we had expressed our feelings for each other just two nights before. Then he became someone else's boyfriend, and remained so, for much longer than he and I lasted. I should've known it would happen, since it happens quite often. My first kiss, who refused to be my boyfriend, met the girl of his dreams while I still ached for him. They're still together today. Since then, I've been the second choice for several more men. The most recent ones occurred this summer, when I tried and failed to win the heart of my friend Ken -- he started dating the person that he truly liked instead of settling for me. I lost Brian to his ex-girlfriend (although, in that case, I think they belonged together anyway). Each time, I laughed one of those sad, desperate guffaws -- here we go again! What makes men connect with the girl of their dreams after sparking with me? Another concept may be more applicable to my situation: the idea of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps I'm so aware of my ""magic touch"" that I'm making it happen. While the first love arrived in Europe, I even warned him what may happen. At the time, though, he waved the thought away. ""I'm so picky, I rarely really like a girl like I like you,"" he typed. A month later, he must've been pleasantly shocked to discover my unfortunate power reached across the Atlantic Ocean. When Ken told me he was dating Mary, I was angry I'd let this happen to me again. I raged at him. He argued that it's irrational to use my past experience to predict the outcome of my future relationships (or my attempts at them). I'm sure that there'll be a guy someday who doesn't find me easy to move on from, but in the meantime I can't ignore the pattern and pretend that each time was a coincidence, as Ken had wanted me to do. I don't know if there is a way to avoid the seemingly inevitable. Each time I let my hopes conquer my superstition, there's a crash, a burn, a deflation, and the temporary loss of the ability to giggle, but I choose the chance of being the girl before the girlfriend over giving up the chance for breaking my streak.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Frank Buckles considered it his duty to represent his fellow soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day. Frank Buckles, 107 and the last living U.S. WWI veteran, said it was his duty to represent his fallen soldiers. ""I have to,"" he told CNN, ""because I'm the last living member of Americans"" who fought in what was called The Great War. Buckles, 107, who is the sole living U.S. World War I veteran, attended ceremonies Tuesday at the grave of Gen. John Pershing, the top U.S. commander in that war. He was present for the first Veterans Day in 1918 -- though it was originally called Armistice Day -- that marked the end of WWI. Buckles was warmly greeted with standing applause by those in uniform and others who had gathered for the commemoration, but he said he did not think the fuss was about him. ""I can see what they're honoring, the veterans of World War I."" ""Time has passed very quickly to me,"" he said after a wreath-laying. ""I've had a lot of activity in the last 90 years.""  Watch interview with Frank Buckles » . According to an autobiography released this year by the Pentagon, Buckles was eager to join the war. Although only 16 in the summer of 1917, he lied about his age to get into the armed services. He said his recruiter told him ""the Ambulance Service was the quickest way to get to France,"" so he took training in trench casualty retrieval. Buckles was an officer's escort in France before joining a detail transporting German prisoners of war. A few decades later, Buckles was in the Philippines as a civilian, on the day in December 1941 that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. He was taken as a prisoner of war in Manila and held for 39 months. Today Buckles is the symbolic leader of a drive to improve a run-down city-owned memorial on the National Mall for those lost in the World War I. The gazebo-styled structure was built in the 1930s. There is no national memorial in the nation's capital for the troops known as ""doughboys"" who served in the war that ended 90 years ago. Legislation in Congress would provide federal funding to restore and enhance the city's memorial.

"(CNN) -- Seoul is a bit of curio. On the surface it's as modern as any city could hope to be, addicted as it is to technology and modern design. Let me entertain you, Korean-style. Bars and karaoke rooms abound in entertainment areas. Yet among the blocky skyscrapers and highways running through the sprawling city like monuments to the country's rapid industrialization, are vestiges of the 600-year-old capital. Mountains, parks and 16th century palaces are in stark contrast to the neon and noise of the city's shopping and entertainment areas. Duck off one of the main boulevards like Saemunangil in the center of the city and you can discover one of pulsating areas where Seoulites relax -- often in city's thousands of restaurants, bars and noraebang (karaoke bars) that should feature in even a flying visit. Home to over 10 million people, the best policy is to make the most of just a few of the city's districts. Start near City Hall in Myeongdong, a downtown area close to some of the city's best sites and shopping (located on and around Myeong-donggil) and all within a walkable distance. Steps away from City Hall subway station is one of the city's Joseon dynasty palaces, Deoksugung, where you can sample a quieter side of Seoul. It's the site of one of Korea's King Seonjo's residences; he turned the old aristocratic house into a palace in 1593. If you're in the city on Sunday, a reenactment of the changing of the guards takes place outside the main gate; false beards are moustaches are attached as the brightly colored guards go through the motions. A few minutes from the palace is the decent National Museum on Contemporary Art, where international and Korean artists get a regular showing. The tranquility of the palace grounds are a great contrast to much of the rest of the city -- not far away original parts of old Seoul's city walls can still be seen in mountains to the north. For a closer inspection of Seoul of old, history buffs can get their fill at the Seoul Museum of History, twenty minutes walk from Deoksugung Palace. Better is to push on another 20 minutes from the museum and you'll hit Gyeongbokgung, the largest and grandest of the city's palace grounds. To save pounding the concrete there hop in a taxi -- standard cabs are white, but for the sake of a bit more legroom, shinier leather seats, and twice the cost, black deluxe taxis are also cruising the streets. In true Seoul tech style, many are equipped with a free digital translation service, useful as many drivers don't speak much English. The preserved village of Bukchon lies between Gyeongbok Palace to the west and Changdeok Palace to the east, where you can wander around restored timber houses and courtyards, and also grab a bite to eat in one of the area's cafes or restaurants. The city and Korea in general has a fascination with technology and design and is constantly positioning itself on the cutting edge of both. The most recent addition to the city's modern landscape is Dutch architect Rem Koohaas' ""Transformer"". His shape-changing building can flip onto one of its three sides depending on its use and is currently home to a Prada Exhibition. It sits in a cozy juxtaposition next to the 16th century Gyeonghui Palace pavilion. For a less ambiguous view of the city, hop in a taxi to Namsan cable car station. It will propel you up to a peak in Namsan park -- central Seoul's biggest -- next to the Seoul Tower, from where you can survey the sprawling metropolis. Throw yourself back into the thick of it by hitting Namdaemun market, also known as the goblin market. It's a hive of goods from cheese to camcorders, often sold at cheaper prices than elsewhere. Don't expect just stalls, it's more a mix of buildings, underground malls and shops. Shinsegae department store is a city favorite in Myeongdong, but those after a bit of South Korean kitsch or quirk should be happy browsing around the boutiques off Myeongdong-gil and Myeongdong Jungang. More Meccas to mammon can be found at Dongdaemun to the east. It's been the site of a market since 1905, but inevitably is now a block of towers stuffed with shopping malls. Be careful, it could take a whole day to explore each one. Crossing downtown Seoul is the Cheonggye stream -- a river that was covered by a road until it was unearthed in 2005 and transformed into one of the city center's most popular urban oases and worth a stroll in the evening. Just north of Cheonggye is the slightly twee area of Insadong, an area as close as Seoul comes to its past in its present work-a-day guise. The area has as few tacky tourist shops, but gets enough local life to make it a good area to grab a bite to eat. The narrow winding streets off Insadonggil are crammed with traditional style buildings housing restaurants where Korean barbeques, bibimbap, kimchi and other delights of Korean cuisine can be sampled and often quite reasonably priced. For a bit of local flavor on the go, street vendors serve up kimchi pancakes, octopus and other Korean snacks, while mobile restaurants appear on some of the street corners around Myeong-dong and Insadong when night falls. Duck under the temporary tarpaulin hoisted over these carts, take a seat next to a local and enjoy cultural feast as well as simple, fresh cooked local dishes. Soju, the local firewater, or some Korean beer is a typical accompaniment. It could get you in the mood for a bout of karaoke in a private room, or noraebang. In which case it could be worth asking your hotel concierge for a recommendation for an English language-friendly one, or just dive in and indulge in the randomness of it all. North east of downtown is Hongdae; a decent area for bars and music, and its more salubrious that Itaewon, twenty minutes south in a taxi from downtown Seoul. Here you're more likely to see U.S. military police in a club or bar than a local, which is another reminder that the other world that is North Korea is only 30 miles away. If you have an extra few days, take a trip to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) -- organized tours are the only way to see it.","Among the urban sprawl are pockets of tranquility, neon-lit fun and greenery .

"(CNN)  -- Mount Redoubt volcano in southern Alaska has erupted again, shooting ash as high as 45,000 feet in the air on Saturday, experts said. A series of eruptions has been rattling Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano since Sunday. The eruption occurred at about 1:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET), the U.S. Geological Survey told CNN. Some of the ash fell around Anchorage, resulting in the airport to close, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The volcano erupted three times Friday, at times shooting ash as high as 51,000 feet. The eruptions are the latest in a series that began March 22. The Alaska Volcano Observatory has set the alert level at its highest possible designation -- red -- indicating that an eruption is under way or imminent and that the eruption will produce a ""significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere."" Friday's volcano activity prompted Alaska Airlines to limit flights to and from Anchorage, according to the airline's Web site. It canceled all its Thursday flights to and from Anchorage after an eruption earlier in the day sent an ash cloud 65,000 feet high. The eruptions are the latest in a series that began Sunday.","NEW: Mount Redoubt volcano in southern Alaska erupted again on Saturday .

"(CNN)  -- Five leaders of what was once the nation's largest Muslim charity were given long prison sentences Wednesday by a federal judge, months after they were found guilty of aiding a militant Palestinian organization. Ghassan Elashi, seen here at 2001 news conference, was sentenced to 65 years in prison. ""These sentences should serve as a strong warning to anyone who knowingly provides financial support to terrorists under the guise of humanitarian relief,"" said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security. Five leaders of the now-defunct Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development were convicted in November by a federal jury for providing money and resources to the Palestinian group Hamas, designated by the United States as a terrorist organization. The trial resulted from a 15-year Justice Department investigation. Two of the men -- Shukri Abu Baker, 50, of Garland, Texas, and Ghassan Elashi, 55, of Richardson, Texas -- were also convicted on tax fraud charges. At a federal court in Dallas, Texas, U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis sentenced Abu Baker and Elashi to 65 years in prison. The other three received lesser sentences: Mohammad El-Mezain, 55, of San Diego, California, and Abdulrahman Odeh, 49, of Patterson, New Jersey each received 15 years in prison. Mufid Abdulqader, 49, of Richardson, Texas, received 20 years. Federal authorities said the Holy Land Foundation was incorporated by Abu Baker, El-Mezain and Elashi. The other two worked as fundraisers. The Bush administration shut down the Holy Land Organization in 2001 and froze its assets, charging that it was raising millions of dollars for Hamas. Before it was shut down, the group, based in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, was hailed as the largest Muslim charity in America. The Justice Department accused it of funneling $12.4 million to Hamas in the guise of humanitarian donations. A first trial in 2007 ended in mistrial, prompting the Justice Department to refile charges. The jury in the second trial, which lasted two months, deliberated for eight days. Wednesday's sentencing, said Kris, culminated ""many years of painstaking investigative and prosecutorial work at the federal, state and local levels.""","Holy Land Foundation has been called the biggest Muslim charity in U.S.

"(CNN) -- A ship carrying U.N. relief supplies, including food and water, arrived Friday in the hurricane-ravaged Haitian city of Gonaives, an official with the United Nations' World Food Programme said. The ship sailed from the capital, Port-au-Prince, carrying 19 tons of high-energy biscuits, 50,000 bottles of water, water purification tablets and other supplies, Myrta Kaulard said. An ambulance, two trucks, a four-wheel drive vehicle and a small speedboat to be used in rescues were also aboard the ship, she said. ""Distributions are ongoing at present,"" she said, speaking by phone from the capital. ""We are also airlifting biscuits now to Gonaives."" Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has endured three storms -- Hanna, Gustav and Fay -- over the past month. The last storm, Hanna, killed at least 137 people when it passed Tuesday over Gonaives and lingered nearby for days. It left water more than 4 meters deep in some places in the city, according to Abel Nazaire, Haiti's assistant coordinator of Risk and Disaster Management.  Watch as flooding overwhelms Haitians » . Much of the water remained Friday in Gonaives, and the city was unreachable by car or truck, as roads were flooded and bridges had collapsed, Kaulard said. ""We need to send food and water and primary needs,"" said Jean-Pierre Gueatou, executive director of the Haitian Red Cross. ""The other things, they will come later."" People trudged through city streets that were covered in murky brown water thigh-deep and higher in some places. Some residents camped out on their roofs, their clothing and blankets hung over the sides of buildings. ""Drinking water is the biggest problem,"" said Joel Trimble, co-founder of Haiti for Christ Ministries. ""That water that everybody's been wading in -- now for days -- is contaminated with dead carcasses of animals, and cadavers of people."" ""We remember the last time this happened,"" a man told The Associated Press, according to the agency's translation. ""It was the same situation. A lot of aid money was given for nothing. They did nothing with that money. If that money had been invested in this town, we would not be in this situation today."" ""People really have lost a lot of things,"" Kaulard said. ""They are asking for clothes, they are asking for water, they are asking for food. ""The situation is very tense, people are exhausted."" Kaulard said World Food Programme officials hope to send another ship laden with similar supplies on Saturday, before Hurricane Ike, a Category 3 storm in the central Atlantic, approaches. Ike is predicted to sweep more than 100 miles north of Hispaniola -- the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. ""We really hope that the current trajectory ... is maintained,"" Kaulard said. On Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard delivered enough hygiene kits, plastic sheeting and water jugs for 2,000 people in Gonaives, according to the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. With those supplies, and others expected to arrive Saturday in Gonaives on a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, the United States expects to help about 10,000 people, the embassy said. In addition, the USS Kearsarge is expected to arrive Monday in Haiti from Colombia to support relief efforts, the embassy said, though it noted that Hurricane Ike could delay its arrival. U.S. ambassadors in Jamaica and Haiti have authorized $100,000 in emergency relief for each country, and the United States is providing $50,000 worth for the Dominican Republic, said State Department deputy spokesman Robert Wood in Washington. The United States offered to send humanitarian relief and a disaster assistance team to Cuba, but has received no response from the Cuban government, the State Department said. ""The situation in Gonaives is catastrophic,"" Daniel Rouzier, Haiti chairman of Food for the Poor, wrote in an e-mail, according to the AP.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to examine whether prosecutors can aggressively prosecute illegal immigrants for identity theft if they didn't know the documents they were given belonged to someone else. The Supreme Court has agreed to grapple with the issues of identity theft and illegal immigration. The justices announced they will hear arguments in the appeal of a Mexican national arrested in a government work site raid in the Midwest. A ruling is expected by June. At issue is whether people who use fake IDs to obtain work in the United States but did not know the documents belonged to someone else can be convicted of ""aggravated identity theft."" Stealing personal identification such as Social Security numbers  is illegal, but federal courts around the country are divided over how to treat people who buy them on the black market. Federal law states that for aggravated identity theft to occur, it must be proved that a person ""knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person."" Many criminals steal a person's identification to empty his or her bank account or falsely obtain loans or credit. Lawyers for the detained illegal immigrants say their clients simply used numbers picked ""out of thin air"" that happened to belong to another person. They used the numbers only to obtain work, not steal to money, the lawyers said. The Justice Department argues its prosecutors need not prove ""knowledge"" that the documents belonged to someone else instead of being fabricated. The difference could mean an additional two years in federal prison under an enhanced sentence. Most workers with false papers serve only a few months behind bars, and many are then deported. At stake is the government's crackdown on undocumented workers, most of whom must rely on fake IDs to obtain employment. Read a report from the front lines of the immigration debate . The case before the justices involves Mexican immigrant Ignacio Flores-Figueroa, who worked at a steel plant in East Moline, Illinois. He was arrested with phony Social Security and alien registration cards that had been assigned to someone else. He admitted obtaining the documents but said he did not know they were someone else's. He was convicted and sentenced to 75 months in prison. The court did not act on a similar appeal from a Mexican national who was arrested during a raid on a meat processing plant in Iowa, the largest criminal workplace enforcement operation in U.S. history. Nicasio Mendoza-Gonzalez was among 389 people arrested, most of whom were given five months in prison.","Attorneys for illegal immigrants argue their clients used random numbers .

"YANGON, Myanmar (CNN) -- Courts in Myanmar have sentenced a blogger, a poet and several dissidents to several years in jail for anti-regime activities, a court official told CNN Tuesday. Young people at an Internet cafe in Myanmar. The verdicts were announced Monday and Tuesday, the court official said. Blogger Nay Phone Latt was sentenced to more than 20 years in jail for his illegal Internet activities, the court official said. The blogger was a ""major source of information for the outside world"" when the military junta used force last year to suppress anti-government demonstrations, said The Irrawaddy, an online newspaper published by exiles from Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. The government exercises strict controls over media outlets in the southeast Asian country. Dissidents often turn to the Internet to disseminate information. In the second case, poet Saw Wai received a two-year jail sentence for a poem he wrote for Valentine's Day that contained a veiled jab at the junta's leading figure, Senior Gen. Than Shwe. The first words of each line in the eight-line poem, ""February the Fourteenth"" spelled out the message: ""Senior General Than Shwe is crazy with power."" On Tuesday, the government handed down prison sentences to about a dozen members of a pro-democracy group known as the '88 Generation Students. Irrawaddy said the members were each sentenced to 65 years in jail, but CNN could not independently confirm the figure. Members of the group took part in the anti-government demonstrations that ended with the death of as many as 100 people last year after security forces clashed with thousands of protesters. The dead included 40 Buddhist monks. Witnesses said the violent crackdown in September 2007 came as hundreds of monks defied a military ban on public assembly. Until then, demonstrations led by the monks -- who are highly respected in the predominantly Buddhist country -- had gone largely unchallenged by the military, which has ruled the country since the 1960s. The protests were sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government, and quickly escalated. The action was informally dubbed the ""Saffron Revolution"" because of the maroon robes with saffron sashes that the monks wore.","Myanmar court jails blogger, poet and dissidents for anti-regime activities ."
"(CNN) -- Reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on FBI insider W. Mark Felt as a reliable but anonymous source for their stories on the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. Carl Bernstein says ""Deep Throat's"" information on Watergate was ""absolutely invaluable."" Felt, referred to as ""Deep Throat"" in the Washington Post stories and in Woodward and Bernstein's book ""All the President's Men,"" died Thursday in California at 95. He revealed his identity for the first time in 2005. Bernstein never met Felt until this year, but praised his courage during an interview Friday on CNN's ""American Morning."" AM: What are your thoughts on the occasion of Mark Felt's death? Bernstein: I think it's a little emotional, even though he was 95 years old. He was integral to our coverage. He was one of many sources in Watergate who had both the intelligence and the courage to tell the truth. And in his own organization he was one of the few, and he was near the top. What his information enabled us to do was to confirm stories that we had really obtained elsewhere, more than anything else, rather than give us that much primary information. But it was invaluable, and he performed a great act of courage and national service.  Watch a video obituary of W. Mark Felt » . AM: The way that he was portrayed by Hal Holbrook in ""All the President's Men"" was he would give your partner Bob Woodward a little bit of a tease and say, ""I'm not going to tell you anything more than that; you've got to follow the trail."" Was that an accurate portrayal? Bernstein: Yeah. Yeah, that's what we did. But his knowledge gave us a grounding and assurance that we were right in what we were saying and reporting. [He gave us] a certainty in a situation where you had the leader of the free world attacking the press every day, making our conduct -- Woodward's, myself's, the Washington Post's -- the issue in Watergate rather than the conduct of the president and his men. So I think Mark Felt's confirming this information (and occasionally he gave us some important information that we hadn't obtained, toward the end, elsewhere), it was absolutely invaluable. AM: It was always Bob Woodward's intention to keep the identity of Deep Throat secret until the occasion of Mark Felt's death. Bernstein: Well, we both kept it. I knew who he was. The two of us knew. AM: Was it a surprise when it came out in 2005? Bernstein: To both of us. It was a total surprise, even though I'm a contributing editor at Vanity Fair magazine and they disclosed it. They scooped everybody on that one. Yeah, we were surprised. Bob and I went out to San Francisco a few weeks ago; we had a speech out there. And we went to see Mark Felt, and we had a kind of wonderful couple of hours with him. He knew we were coming; he was looking forward to it. But he had been very ill, and it was a kind of closing of the circle, and it was a wonderful experience. AM: Was that the first time you had met him in person. Bernstein: First time I had met him, yes. Bob had met him as a young ensign in the Navy, when he was a messenger at the Pentagon and had renewed the acquaintance. AM: So what did you think of him when you met him? Bernstein: First of all, I was aware that he was 95 years old and in the last stages of his life. But I was amazed at his relative vigor given the fact that he had been quite ill. I was also surprised that there were some moments of clarity, because he had dementia. AM: His family, when the news came out in 2005, declared him to be an American hero. Would you agree? Bernstein: Obviously he is. Look, Watergate was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. And he had the guts to say, ""Wait. The Constitution is more important in this situation than a president of the United States who breaks the law."" It's an important lesson, I think, for the country and for people in our business, as well.","Watergate reporter Bernstein knew who Mark Felt was; only Woodward contacted him .

"WOODBURY, Minnesota (CNN)  -- At 14, Andrew Busskohl got a second chance at life when he underwent a heart transplant. But four years later, neighbors have more fear than compassion for him. Police say Andrew Busskohl plotted to kill a neighbor but was stopped before it got to that point. Busskohl, 18, has been charged with two felony counts relating to a break-in attempt. But police say he was up to something more sinister: a murder plot that involved cutting out the victim's heart or slicing off his eyelids. Busskohl posted $100,000 bail on condition he undergo psychological evaluation. He's living with his mother and brother in the same neighborhood where authorities say he had planned to carry out his attack. As condition of his release, he is allowed to leave the Woodbury, Minnesota, home only for medical, psychological and legal appointments. Defense attorney Joe Friedberg says that his client is a threat to no one and that his medications affected his mood. ""The Woodbury police are excited because they got something that's more serious than a cat up a tree,"" Friedberg said. ""This is a very unique case, and frankly, I don't know the ramifications of anything yet."" Busskohl has been charged with one count of first-degree attempted burglary with a dangerous weapon and one count of aggravated harassment with a dangerous weapon. He has not entered a plea in the case. Busskohl's release has sent shockwaves through this quiet Minneapolis suburb of about 50,000 people. Residents say they survey their homes before entering, secure their windows and check behind curtains and other household items once inside. Once rarely used, alarm systems now are on constantly. ""My whole family is feeling a lot more nervous,"" said one neighbor, who asked not to be identified. ""We're just always looking out the windows. ... The whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way."" Tim Kinateder said that his alarm system is on ""nonstop now"" and that everyone in his family has taken extreme precautions around the home. He didn't mince his words when he spoke of Busskohl being out on bail. ""That, to me, is ridiculous. I don't understand how that can happen,"" Kinateder said. Across the street, Jim Fratto has taken more security measures than most. Fratto sleeps with a baseball bat next to his bed and a flashlight on his nightstand. A 10-foot-long 2 by 4 barricades his bedroom door. He's installed lights with motion sensors on the outside of his home and added locks on his doors, both inside and out.  Tour Fratto's high-security house » . It is Fratto who, authorities say, was to be Busskohl's possible victim. He lives just a few blocks from Busskohl. Walking through his home, Fratto shows off the locks on his interior doors. They rattle and clang with every movement. ""He's going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me. And hopefully, I'll be able to wake up by then,"" he said through a wild-eyed gaze and booming laugh. ""If not, sayonara."" Busskohl admits breaking a window of Fratto's home, police say, in the early hours of August 6. Although it may not sound like much on the surface, police now say it was the first step of the plot. Busskohl was planning to return to that shattered window in the next couple of days for an easy entry, one without commotion, according to the criminal complaint filed against him. The complaint says one of Busskohl's friends, Eric Eischens, went to police shortly after the window-breaking incident. ""Mr. Eischens stated that Mr. Busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone,"" the complaint says. ""Mr. Eischens stated that Mr. Busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendant's house."" Eischens is quoted in the complaint as also telling police that ""Mr. Busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat. Mr. Busskohl told Mr. Eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart."" The complaint alleges that Busskohl acknowledged to police his conversation with his friend but also told them, ""I'm not even sure I would have gone through with it."" Friedberg, the defense attorney, said he could understand Fratto being ""frightened or mad."" ""The evidence I received, [Busskohl] discussed very openly these things with the police,"" Friedberg said. ""When you said bizarre, that's probably an understatement."" Busskohl was taking seven or eight medications -- a combination of anti-rejection medicine for his heart and anti-depressants -- at the time of his arrest, according to Friedberg. He said a doctor who evaluated him in jail recommended that he be taken off one medication and two others be substituted in its place. ""Within eight to 10 hours, the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone,"" Friedberg says. ""If anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point, he represents no threat to anyone."" He has advised his client not to talk with members of the media. In 2004, Busskohl became a common face on local Minnesota media when he underwent a successful heart transplant. Shortly after the surgery, according to the Star Tribune newspaper, he showed off his scar to a reporter and said, ""I plan on becoming a surgeon."" If convicted on the charges, Busskohl could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $17,500 for the first count and a maximum of 5 years and $10,000 fine for the second count. Busskohl has no prior arrests, and the prosecutor's office said that under the sentencing guidelines of Minnesota, it would be unlikely he'd serve more than 48 months if convicted. His arraignment is set for September 3. According to the criminal complaint filed this month, authorities obtained a search warrant for Busskohl's car and found a swim cap, black gloves, latex gloves, scrubs, gauze, an address card with Fratto's name and address, a map to Fratto's house, shoe covers, a pry bar, a black mask, two bags, one knife, two flashlights, one set of tweezers, two pairs of scissors and one scalpel. Busskohl told authorities the items were there ""if [he] somehow went through with the act,"" according to the complaint. Fratto says it was difficult to grasp when police first informed him of the alleged plot. ""I didn't even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news,"" he said. Standing in his backyard, he pointed into the air. ""What bothers me is: If you throw a rock, he's about four blocks away."" Although many neighbors said they believe that a much more serious charge of attempted murder should have been pursued, the prosecutor stands by his decision. Washington County attorney Doug Johnson said the two felony counts Busskohl faces are the only ones he could pursue under state law. For a charge of attempted murder, he said, an individual has to follow through on an act ""which is a substantial step toward, and more than preparation for, the commission of the crime."" ""Now I'm not saying I'm happy with that [law],"" Johnson said. ""But if we have somebody that's just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime, we can't charge an attempt. And that's what this is all about."" As for Fratto, he'll still keep locking his doors, armed with his flashlight and baseball bat. He's thankful to still be alive. ""If it wasn't for his friend and the grace of God, that'd be it.""","Police: Heart transplant teen planned to cut out possible victim's heart .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. attorney general is trying to prevent immigration authorities from sending a Muslim woman to her home country, where she was a victim of female genital mutilation. Attorney General Michael Mukasey ordered an immigration court to reconsider an African woman's case. In a stinging order overriding federal immigration courts, Mukasey blasted a decision that said a 28-year-old citizen and native of Mali should be expelled ""because her genitalia already had been mutilated [so] she had no basis to fear future persecution if returned to her home country."" Calling the rationale ""flawed,"" Mukasey sent the case back to the Board of Immigration Appeals with orders to reconsider. The woman, a native of Mali, begged the court not to send her back to her Bambara tribe. The 28-year-old said if she returned and had a daughter, the child also would be subject to mutilation. The woman also said she faced forced marriage if she had to go home. Mukasey cited what he concluded were two significant factual errors in the court's rejection of her appeal. ""Female genital mutilation is not necessarily a one-time event,"" Mukasey said. He noted that the board in a previous case had granted asylum in to one woman whose ""vaginal opening was sewn shut approximately five times after being opened to allow for sexual intercourse and child birth."" He also concluded that the Board of Immigration Appeals was wrong to assume that the woman ""must fear persecution in exactly the same form [namely, repeat female genital mutilation] to qualify for relief."" Mukasey had been urged to look into the matter by angered members of Congress in the wake of the January decision. ""This recent action taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals is a step backward for the rights of women worldwide,"" declared Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, in a January letter. ""Female genital mutilation is a gross violation of a woman's human rights and has traditionally been grounds for the granting of an asylum claim,"" Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-California, said in the letter. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, issued a statement applauding Mukasey's action, and declaring female genital mutilation a ""barbaric practice widely regarded as a human rights abuse."" The Justice Department acknowledged it is extraordinarily rare for an attorney general to jump into a relatively low-level immigration case. The immigration courts decide about 40,000 cases a year, and an attorney general has issued an opinion on a case only three times in the past three years. Female genital mutilation is common in parts of Africa, Asia and in some Arab countries, according to the United Nations. The operation is viewed by some ethnic groups as a means to control a woman's sexuality and is sometimes a prerequisite for marriage or the right to inherit. The procedure can cause tissue injury, severe infection and fever, among other complications. The U.N. has recorded cases in which hemorrhaging and infection lead to death.","Court ruled that because woman already had surgery, she should not get asylum .

"(CNN) -- The ozone hole over Antarctica in 2008 is larger in both size and ozone loss than last year, but not as large as in 2006, the European Space Agency said Tuesday. Some chemical processes produce ozone-depleting gases. The hole is a thinning area in the ozone layer over Antarctica and the size of the hole varies every year depending on weather conditions. This year, the size of the thinned area reached about 27 million square kilometers (10.4 million square miles), compared to 25 million square kilometers (9.65 million square miles) in 2007. In 2006, the hole was a record 29 million square kilometers (11.2 million square miles), larger than North America, the ESA said. The ESA announced its results based on information from German and Dutch researchers who analyzed satellite data. Depletion of ozone is caused by extreme cold temperatures at high altitude and the presence of ozone-destroying gases, such as chlorine and bromine, in the atmosphere, the ESA said. Those gases originate from man-made products like chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were phased out under a global agreement two decades ago but continue to linger in the atmosphere. Ozone is a protective atmospheric layer found at an altitude of about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles). It acts as a sunlight filter, shielding life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays that put humans at greater risk of skin cancer and cataracts and harm marine life, the agency said.","2008 ozone hole larger than in 2007, European Space Agency says .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A police officer chasing a theft suspect was fatally shot Thursday night by another officer after he failed to drop his weapon when ordered to, authorities said. Officer Omar Edwards, 25, was not wearing a bulletproof vest and did not fire a shot, authorities say. Authorities said Officer Omar Edwards, 25, was shot three times. The incident is under investigation. Edwards was in plainclothes and carrying a handgun as he chased the suspect past a police car. Authorities said the officer who shot him said he didn't realize Edwards was a police officer. Edwards had just left the Housing Bureau Station House on East 124th Street, said Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly at a news conference Friday. As Edwards approached his vehicle, he saw a man rummaging through it. Edwards took out his gun -- a Smith and Wesson 9 mm -- and chased the alleged thief, 43-year-old Miguel Santiago, said NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Meanwhile, a police cruiser with a sergeant and two officers, including Officer Andrew Dunton, had just turned onto 125th Street from 1st Avenue. Santiago ran in front of the unmarked vehicle as it approached halfway up the block and the vehicle stopped. The officer in the front passenger seat got out of the vehicle and shouted for Edwards to stop running and drop his weapon. According to Kelly, the officers reported that, after the command was given, Edwards turned toward Dunton with his gun in his hand.  Watch Commissioner Kelly describe the shooting » . Dunton fired his Glock 9 mm six times, hitting Edwards three of those times -- once in the left arm, once in the left side and once in the back, according to police. Emergency crews responding to the scene found Edwards wearing a police academy T-shirt under his clothes and found his police shield and ID in his front left pants pocket, according to Browne. Edwards, who lived in Brooklyn, was recently married and had two small children, according to CNN affiliate WABC-TV in New York. On Friday, his relatives remembered him as a good person who achieved what he set out to do. ""He was a wonderful, wonderful child from when he was small,"" his father, Ricardo Edwards, told WABC. ""His desire was always to be a policeman and to play football,"" his uncle, Jerome Harding told the New York TV station. ""And he did accomplish both, because he plays for the Police Department."" Edwards was pronounced dead at Harlem Hospital at 11:21 p.m. Thursday, according to Kelly. ""Tragic accidents like this are another reminder of the dangers our police officers often face as they keep our city the safest big city in the nation,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday. ""Rest assured we will find out exactly what happened here, see what we can learn from it so it may never happen again. All the city's prayers are with Omar Edwards and his family."" Five eyewitnesses, along with 20 people who reported hearing gunshots, were interviewed by police. The officer who fired the shots has 4½  years' experience, authorities said. The officers involved have been placed on administrative duties while the shooting is investigated. Police later arrested the alleged thief on suspicion of breaking into Edwards' car.","Authorities: Omar Edwards, chasing a suspect, was fatally shot by another officer .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Antiviolence protesters stretched out 16,000 coconuts on Brazil's world-famous Copacabana beach Saturday, each one representing a victim of urban violence. Protesters used dummies to represent victims of violence on Brazil's Copacabana beach this week. Activists from ONG Rio de Paz led a protest march Saturday morning that included residents and tourists who usually can be found on the beach on weekends. The protesters strung up a sign on the sand that said ""Shame"" in Spanish, Portuguese, English and French. They finished with a minute of silence for the victims of violence. Rio de Paz said the coconuts represent victims of violence, homicides, dead police officers and those who have been shot in gunfights between authorities and gangs of narcotics traffickers. The figure itself was obtained from official information from the Rio de Janeiro governmental Institute of Public Security. It was the second protest staged this week on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach by the group Rio de Paz. On Tuesday, the group created a mock cemetery in the sand with mannequins representing 9,000 people who Rio de Paz says have been slain and secretly buried since January 2007. Rio de Paz President Antonio Carlos Costa said he believes that about 6,000 of the missing people were killed, many by drug traffickers fighting for territory in Rio's slums and poor neighborhoods. Others, he said, were killed by hit squads and police acting on their own. ""In general, they are assassinated by police -- police acting outside of their regular work hours,"" Costa said Tuesday. ""They are also assassinated by narcotraffickers. The bodies are disposed of in secret cemeteries in the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area or incinerated alive by narcotraffickers in what they call 'microwaves.' "" To illustrate the point, demonstrators also constructed facsimiles of the ""microwaves"" that narcotics traffickers and death squads reportedly use to cremate remains of those they have abducted.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Three years ago Tuesday, Leslie Marva Adams, an attractive, 40-year-old hair stylist from Atlanta, Georgia, chatted on the phone with her mother in the morning. Leslie Adams, 40, filed a restraining order against an old boyfriend and disappeared three years ago. It was the last conversation she would have with a family member. On the third anniversary of Adams' disappearance, her family is still waiting for answers. Her daughter, Cierra Burk, 19, clings to the belief that Adams is alive. ""We will find her,"" Burk says. The family became concerned when Adams failed to show up for her sister's birthday party the day after she talked on the phone with her mother. Two days after the missed party, Adams was officially reported missing. At her apartment in suburban Lilburn, police found evidence suggesting foul play -- a 12-inch blood stain near her bed and a .45-caliber bullet casing. Adams' car was parked in her driveway and a handwritten note was found on her door. Investigators soon learned the note was from her sister, Roberta. It said, ""Leslie, we're worried about you, please call me as soon as possible.""  Watch how the mystery began with a missed party » . Adams had been having trouble with her ex-boyfriend, Billy Joe Cook, in the days leading up to her disappearance. She had accused him of stalking her and had filed a restraining order. In the court document, she alleged that Cook had verbally and physically abused her. She said she feared for her life. A temporary restraining order was granted by the court, but Adams vanished before a scheduled hearing on the matter. Phyllis Adams said her daughter told her in their final conversation that she had argued with Cook over the phone on the previous day. According to the temporary restraining order, Cook was not to have any contact with Adams. Police brought Cook in for questioning and learned he had spoken to Adams on the phone twice the day before she last spoke to her family. Although he was questioned extensively, police have not named Cook a suspect. Police say he was very cooperative and there is no evidence suggesting his involvement in her disappearance, although they have not ruled him or anyone else out as a potential suspect or person of interest. Just when they thought the trail had gone cold, police found what could be a lead in the case. In May 2007, clothing was recovered that could belong to the missing hair-dresser. Police found a pair of men's size 8 Reebok sneakers, size 10 capri pants, and a black sweater in the woods along I-85 in Franklin County, 90 miles from Adams' home in Atlanta. They also discovered human bones and a breast implant near the clothing. Police have sent the remains to a DNA testing lab and they have yet to be identified. The results are inconclusive, and police continue to collect DNA samples from Adams family members for future tests. Leslie Marva Adams is an African-American female who stands 5 feet 5 inches, weighs 130 pounds, and has breast implants. Family members fear the remains could be Leslie Adams, but they are still hopeful that she will be found alive and well. Burk, Adams' daughter, says she struggles with her emotions at this time of year. ""I still believe she is alive and we will find her, but this time of year is very hard,"" she said, fighting the tears. ""It's my aunt's birthday, the day my mom didn't show up and we never saw her again, so it's hard not to break down."" Police and family urge anyone with information on the whereabouts of Leslie Adams to call the Gwinett County Police Department at (770) 513-5300. There is a $25,000 reward for information that helps locate Leslie Adams or leads to the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance.","Atlanta hair stylist Leslie Marva Adams disappeared three years ago .

"(CNN) -- A grandmother, mother and her child died when a military fighter jet crashed into a house in San Diego Monday, igniting a huge fireball, CNN's San Diego affiliates and the San Diego Union Tribune are reporting. Fire rages in a San Diego neighborhood where an F/A-18 jet crashed Monday. Another child is missing, authorities said. A search ended Monday when night fell but will continue Tuesday morning, a spokesperson for the medical examiner said. The father is a businessman who was at work at the time of the crash, and was not reached for comment, according to the Tribune. The paper also reported that Monday night, a pastor and congregants at the family's church, the Korean United Methodist Church of San Diego in Clairemont. The pastor told a television station that the mother was in the home with her two sons -- a 2 month-old and 1 year-old. The mother was a nurse at a hospital. The F/A-18D plane, which authorities described as disabled, was trying to land at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. The jet had just performed landing training on a Navy aircraft carrier before the pilot reported having trouble, according to the Marine Corps.  See map showing crash site, airfield » . ""It was, oh gosh, maybe a couple of hundred feet off the ground. And it was quiet -- I think the engine was off,"" said San Diego resident Ian Lerner, who  was heading to lunch at a shopping center about a half-mile from the neighborhood of about 20 homes when he saw the jet flying low. iReport.com: See Lerner's photos . ""Then all of a sudden we saw the canopy of the jet explode and go up, and then we saw the pilot blast out of the plane and the parachute open,"" Lerner said.

The pilot, whose name was not released, was the only occupant of the two-seat aircraft, according to the Marine Corps. The Tribune spoke with Steve Diamond, a retired naval aviator, who found the pilot in a tree behind a house and helped the man who Diamond said was a lieutenant in his 20s, down from the tree. The pilot told him that after he lost power in the first engine, and that it was decided he would try to get the jet to Miramar on the single working engine, Diamond told the paper. The pilot was in communication with military air traffic controllers before the jet crashed, and the crash site is about two miles (three kilometers) from the airfield, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Burning debris scorched two additional homes and a slice of jet knifed another home. ""This could have wiped out half a dozen homes depending on how it landed,"" said Maurice Luque, a spokesman for the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department. See photos of fiery crash site » . Inside one of those houses, Robert Johnson sat in the living room with his daughter, Heather Certain, and her 2-year-old son, Nicholas, according to the San Diego Union Tribune.

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old Minnesota boy who has cancer has resumed chemotherapy treatments and is not responding well, a family spokesman said Friday. Doctors say Daniel Hauser's lymphoma responded well to a first round of chemotherapy in February. Danny Hauser started a second round of chemotherapy treatment this week, Jim Navarro said in a statement on the family's Web site, dannyhauser.com. ""The doctor changed the number of chemotherapy drugs in the protocol submitted to the court. Danny is not tolerating the drugs well and has been vomiting all day. He is understandably angry and depressed about being forced to go through the ravages of chemotherapy again."" Daniel underwent his first round of chemotherapy in February, a month after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. But his parents were concerned about the treatment's side effects, which typically include nausea, and decided to end the chemotherapy regimen and pursue holistic treatments instead. When Daniel's oncologist learned of the decision to reject standard treatment, which doctors say is associated with a cure rate of as high as 90 percent, he asked a court to intervene to ensure the teen got chemotherapy. Doctors say that, without it, the disease would likely prove fatal. But last week, before the court could act, Colleen Hauser packed up her son and flew with him to Southern California, from where they were planning to continue to Mexico to seek alternative alternative medical treatment. She said he would have run on his own had she not helped him flee. She changed her mind before crossing the border and returned this week with Daniel to Minnesota, where the family agreed to comply with whatever treatment the court ordered. A medical examination revealed that the boy's tumor had grown since he was diagnosed and the boy's doctor recommended he resume chemotherapy. After examining the boy on Monday, Dr. Michael Richards estimated the tumor's size at 5.3 inches by 5.1 inches by 6.3 inches, and said it was ""protruding outside the chest wall."" He said initiation this week of standard chemotherapy treatment was ""imperative."" Richards recommended at least another five cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation, and added that the ""goal will be to include alternative therapies in which the family is interested, as long as there is not data to suggest that a particular danger exists with any alternative medicine."" District Court Judge John Rodenberg originally took custody of the boy away from his parents, but returned him to his family on the condition that they comply with the recommendations of the cancer specialist. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. As the disease progresses, it compromises a body's ability to fight infection. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this story.","Daniel Hauser started second round of chemotherapy this week, spokesman says .

"(InStyle.com) -- Engagement season is in full swing, which, of course, means an influx proposals, but more importantly, tons of creative ""will you marry me?"" scenarios to top. Take a cue from these celebrities by jaunting off to memorable destinations for a proposal your partner won't forget (or turn down!). Venice was the scene of Avril Lavigne and Dereyck Whibley's engagement. St. Barts . On their first date, Billy Joel took Katie Lee out to dinner, but on that November 2002 evening she got much more than a scene from an Italian restaurant. ""Afterward he took me to see ""Movin' Out"" [the hit musical based on Joel's tunes], got onstage and sang the last two songs,"" recalls Lee, 23, who was visiting New York from Ohio and first met Joel, 55, in the lobby of the Peninsula Hotel, where both were staying. ""I knew he was trying to impress me."" It must have worked; six months after that meeting she moved to Long Island, New York, to live with him, and in January 2004 he proposed on a trip to St. Barts. ""He got down on his knee, and it was a complete surprise,"" Lee recalls. ""That made me feel really special."" Though Scott Wolf, 35, of ""Everwood,"" and Kelley Limp, 28, formerly of ""Real World New Orleans,"" credit a friend with setting them up, in a way they can thank Oprah Winfrey. ""When I first called Kelley,"" says Wolf, ""she said, 'I just sat down with strawberries and chocolate milk to watch ""Oprah."" '"" Apparently it was not the best timing. ""Nobody calls me at 4 o'clock,"" says Limp. ""It's an unwritten rule that I'm watching ""Oprah""."" So Wolf decided to catch the episode, and they discussed it afterward. The chatting continued over a dinner date at Raoul's in New York City. A year later, on a trip to St. Barts, Wolf took Limp boating and pulled into a cove for a sunset dinner, where he gave her a Bruce Winston (son of Harry Winston) 2.7-carat diamond ring. ""I said yes, like, 15 times,"" says Limp. New York City . It was Stephanie March's first and last blind date ever. After weeks of delays, March, then starring on ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"", finally agreed to meet Food Network chef Bobby Flay for dinner at Nobu in New York. Within seconds of meeting Flay, her misgivings about blind dates were dispelled. ""I know it's a cliché, but I remember thinking, Oh my gosh, this is the rest of my life,"" says March. She was right: Just before Christmas 2003, Flay took March ice-skating at Rockefeller Center, where he surprised her with another kind of ice -- a princess-cut diamond ring -- and a proposal. Africa . On the golf course during the 2001 British Open was probably the last place Tiger Woods, 28, expected to meet his future wife, Elin Nordegren, 24. The thunderbolt struck when fellow golfer Jesper Parnevik introduced Woods to Nordegren, who was then working as the Parneviks' nanny. If his scores are any indication, Woods was more than a little distracted by the stunning Swedish former model. He lost the tournament but soon won her heart. And on a South African safari two years later, Woods proposed to Nordegren during a sunset stroll around the Shamwari Game Reserve. Nantucket, Massachusetts . Devon Gummersall, 29, thought he'd blown it after a 1998 date with ""Quarterlife's"" Majandra Delfino, 27. ""I showed up in this awful leather jacket, and Majandra was like, 'Who is this guy?'"" recalls Gummersall, the former co-star of ""My So-Called Life."" After losing the leather, he reconnected with Delfino at a concert five years later -- and didn't miss a beat. Soon, the future groom bought a garnet ring from the Beverly Hills Watch Co. and hid it for a scavenger hunt on a Nantucket, Massachusetts, beach. Says Delfino, ""I dug up this white box, all sandy, and opened it. Devon said, 'Do you know what this means?'"" Delfino definitely did. New Zealand . The romance that blossomed between ""Two and a Half Men's"" Melanie Lynskey, 30, and Jimmi Simpson, 31, star of ""The Farnsworth Invention"" on Broadway, surprised them both. The pair, who had become friends while co-starring in a Stephen King miniseries in 2000, were sharing a taxi when ""good night"" turned into a good-night smooch. ""We kissed each other unexpectedly!"" says Lynskey of the moment. ""Once that happened, I was head over heels for him."" Simpson chose a moonlit moment on the deck of Lynskey's family beach house in New Zealand in 2005 to get down on one knee. ""He opened the ring box,"" she recalls, ""but then he set it on the table. I was like, 'Can I try that on?'"" Six months after Matthew Perry introduced them at a 2004 barbecue, actor Jonathan Silverman, 41, proposed to ""Close to Home"" actress Jennifer Finnigan, 28, in a New Zealand rain forest. Hawaii . Channing Tatum surprised his ""Step Up"" costar Jenna Dewan with a weekend proposal in Maui in September 2007. Tatum arranged to have close friends of the couple fly in for the festivities. Canada . When commissioning an engagement ring for his girlfriend Heidi Klum, Seal had one key word for New York City jeweler Lorraine Schwartz: canary. Schwartz's sister delivered the 10-carat yellow diamond stunner to Whistler, British Columbia, where Seal proposed to Klum on a glacier -- with the sunny piece of ice. England . In May 2004 Jason Priestley arranged a trip to London, England, -- to the very street corner where he and girlfriend Naomi Lowde first met. Once there, Priestley presented Lowde with an emerald-cut, three-diamond ring by Steven Pomerantz. ""It became evident that my life was better with Naomi in it,"" says Priestley. In the summer of 2006, after 3 years of dating, ""Superman Return"" star Brandon Routh purchased the 3-carat diamond ring that had caught girlfriend Courtney Ford's eye during an earlier visit to Beverly Hills jeweler Neil Lane. But since the two were traveling for the ""Superman Returns"" press tour, Routh asked Gilbert Adler, one of the film's producers, to hold the ring until they arrived in England. ""Poor man!"" says Routh. ""He carried it around for two and a half weeks."" Finally, while picnicking in Glastonbury, England, Routh popped the question. Italy . One year after Avril Lavigne and Dereyck Whibley's friendship turned romantic, Whibley, 26, proposed with a 5-carat diamond solitaire after a picnic and gondola ride in Venice, Italy. It was something of a shock for the bride-to-be. ""I might look like a tough chick -- and I am,"" Lavigne once said, ""but I'm a hopeless romantic inside."" Puerto Rico . Just two days before Christmas 2007, under a full moon at midnight in a bay off the coast of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter were seated in a double kayak, taking in the bioluminescent organisms shimmering in the water all alone, except for a tour guide in a second kayak. After giving an ""amazing speech,"" Winter pulled out a 4.3-carat brilliant-cut diamond ring by Michael Barin, Sánchez's favorite jeweler. California . ""I can't remember the exact day I knew she was the one; I remember it was an accumulation of what she's about, where she came from, and her family,"" says tennis star Pete Sampras of his bride, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras. After nine months of dating, Sampras proposed to Wilson at his Los Angeles, California, home with a platinum ring with oval-shaped diamond from Cartier. The romance between Noah Wyle, 29, and Tracy Warbin, 31, a movie makeup artist, was born on the frigid Maine set of the 1997 film ""The Myth of Fingerprints."" Recalls Warbin, ""At the end of one shoot, there was a huge snowball fight. Noah pushed my face into a snowbank. It really, really hurt! I knew then that he liked me, because it was so kindergarten-y."" Wyle concurs: ""It's a technique I learned in grade school, and it's worked for me ever since."" Three years later, on Valentine's Day 1999, at a picnic for two on the couple's Santa Ynez, California, ranch, Wyle got down on one knee to propose, a marquise-cut diamond ring in hand. In February 2005 Christina Aguilera and her beau, Jordan Bratman, went on a Valentine's Day getaway to Carmel, California, where Bratman proposed with a five-carat diamond-and-platinum ring by Stephen Webster.

"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Saudi King Abdullah confirmed Sunday that his country will increase daily oil production from 9 million barrels to 9.7 million in the near future to counter the sharp rise in international oil prices. Saudi Arabia has announced an increase in oil production in a  bid to ease the pressure on oil prices. The Saudi petroleum minister, Ali I. Al-Naimi, said the country will reach the 9.7 million level by July. The announcement comes after Saudi officials announced modest increases. It would be Saudi Arabia's highest production rate since 1981. White House Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto praised the step, saying, ""Any increase in production in today's oil market is welcome. It is important that we also take steps to increase domestic production and our refining capacity."" Meanwhile, the average price of gasoline in the U.S. rose nearly 10 cents in the past two weeks to almost $4.10 a gallon for self-serve regular, according to a national survey released Sunday. The survey showed the national average was just a fraction of a cent under $4.10 a gallon, said survey publisher Trilby Lundberg. That is up 9.7 cents a gallon from the same survey two weeks ago, Lundberg said. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, downplayed the Saudi increase. ""Nice try, but no cigar. When gas is at $4 per gallon, demand increases almost daily, and the Saudis have millions of barrels per day more in spare capacity,"" he said. ""This isn't nearly good enough."" Al-Naimi, the petroleum minister, also said the Saudi government will invest in oil projects that would allow Saudi Arabia to have the capacity to produce 12.5 million barrels per day by the end of next year. King Abdullah's announcement came at the end of the Jeddah energy summit, where he also called for OPEC to set aside $1 billion for a strategy to ease the oil price crisis. He said $500 million should be given to developing nations to help them get the energy they need. King Abdullah said there are ""many factors that made oil prices high."" Along with increased demand, he also cited oil speculators and an increase in taxes in consumer nations. ""Now we see a lot of people point the finger at OPEC as it is solely responsible for this,"" he said. The king's statement came a day after U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, attending the summit, blamed the record oil prices on lack of production. ""All nations must be better at conservation, and the U.S. is at the top of that list,"" said Bodman, who met with journalists ahead of the international meeting of oil producing and consuming nations focusing on high oil prices. Some observers have blamed speculators for driving up oil prices. A key adviser to Saudi Arabia's oil minister said Friday that a number of factors, including speculators and currency fluctuations, are to blame for rising oil prices. ""We need stability,"" Dr. Ibrahim al Muhanna said, adding that Saudi Arabia would like to see producers, consumers and distributors cooperate. But Bodman said he did not believe that they are the cause. Since 2003, he said, global demand for oil has increased because of industry in China, India and the Middle East. But from 2005 to 2007, there was very little increase in supply. Nations need an additional supply of energy to market, whether that energy is nuclear, coal, fossil fuels, solar or wind power, Bodman said. ""We spent 30 years digging ourselves into this hole,"" he said. ""It won't be solved soon."" On Wednesday, President Bush asked Congress to permit drilling for oil in deep water off the U.S. coast to combat rising oil prices. He also renewed his demand that Congress allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, clear the way for more refineries and encourage efforts to recover oil from shale in areas like the Green River Basin, which encompasses parts of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. ""In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply here at home,"" Bush said in a Rose Garden statement.","Saudis will increase daily oil production from 9 million barrels to 9.7 million .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- The Pakistani military says security forces have taken back the city of Mingora from the Taliban, calling it a significant victory in its offensive against the Taliban. Pakistani solders escort a suspected Taliban militant inside an army base in Mingora. Mingora is the largest city in Pakistan's Swat Valley where security forces have been fighting the Taliban in a month-long offensive. ""It is a great accomplishment,"" said Pakistani Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. ""This is the largest city in Swat and for all practical purposes, Mingora has been secured."" Abbas said militants put up a stiff resistance, but their resistance weakened as troops moved in. Abbas told CNN pockets of militants remain just outside Mingora. The fighting has uprooted about 2.4 million Pakistanis from their homes in the northwestern region of the country, according to the latest data from the United Nations. Of those displaced, about 10 percent -- or 240,000 -- are living in refugee camps, according to the U.N. The announcement that the military has pushed the Taliban out of Mingora comes after days of Taliban attacks in other areas in the country. The military issued a press release on Saturday saying that 25 militants and a soldier were killed in fighting across the region over the last 24 hours. Pakistani authorities increased security throughout Islamabad on Friday after a string of deadly bombings in Lahore and Peshawar, and a threat by the Taliban to carry out further attacks. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Wednesday's suicide attack in Lahore on a building housing police, intelligence and emergency offices. Twenty-seven people were killed. The militant group also threatened to continue attacking cities in Pakistan until the military ends its operations against Taliban militants in the country's northwest.","Pakistani military says it has taken back key Swat Valley city of Mingora .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- With its tranquil beaches, the tiny northern island of Sylt is the country's best-kept summer secret. An ideal way to see the island -- especially in late summer when the heather is in full bloom -- is by bike. Where to stay . Long and narrow, and spread over 36 square miles, Sylt has a verdant countryside peppered with its signature low-slung cottages. Many house tiny hotels, like the secluded Dorint Söl'ring Hof (1 Am Sandwall, Rantum; 49-4651/836-200; doubles from $550), a 15-room inn tucked into the dunes on the southern coast with its own hidden stretch of sugary sand. For those who want to be closer to the action, there's the Hotel Stadt Hamburg (2 Strandstrasse; 49-4651/8580; doubles from $253), in the charming village of Westerland. You'll have to walk five minutes to the beach, but this tidy hotel, built in 1869, is an ideal base for exploration. Where to eat . The island's dining scene attracts a number of German celebrities (Claudia Schiffer, Boris Becker), and many frequent the stylish Sansibar (80 Hörnumer Str., Rantum; 49-4651/964-656; dinner for two $130). The restaurant's North Sea-meets-Asian dishes, like fresh mussels in a sweet curry sauce, are a potent draw. In Kampen, you'll find Greta's Rauchfang (5 Strönwai; 49-4651/ 42672; dinner for two $92) next to Louis Vuitton and Hermès. Here, socialites enjoy bottles of Kristall (opened dramatically with sabers), along with small plates of the sweet local shrimp. To get away from the fabulous set, head to Alter Gasthof (5 Alte Dorfstrasse, List; 49-4651/877-244; dinner for two $65) on the isle's northern tip. This 200-year-old inn dishes out classic regional food, including stellar house-smoked salmon and eel. What to do . Sylt is known for its nude beaches. The most famous is Buhne 16 (133A Listlandstrasse, Kampen), where Germans of every stripe let it all hang out as they lounge in wicker basket chairs. For those who like things a bit more covered up, try Am Roten Kliff, just north of Kampen, which is also (no surprise) less crowded. An ideal way to see the island -- especially in late summer when the heather is in full bloom -- is by bike. Fahrrad am Bahnhof (49-4651/5803), in Westerland's main train station, has a terrific rental selection, and the staff will happily suggest a route along Sylt's 136 miles of well-laid-out paths. Getting there . Sylt is reached by train from Berlin (5 hours) or Hamburg (3 1/2 hours). By car, take the autobahn to Niebüll from Berlin (290 miles) or Hamburg (120 miles). There is no road connecting Sylt to the mainland; vehicles board a train for the 30-minute trip to the island. For more, see bahn.de. Planning a beach getaway?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Navy is investigating how thousands of dollars went missing in the rescue of the captain of the Maersk Alabama in April, a Pentagon source told CNN. The USS Bainbridge tows the lifeboat in which Capt. Robert Phillips was held for days. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service opened an investigation into how $30,000 disappeared after special forces snipers shot and killed three pirates, ending the multi-day siege and freeing the captain, who had been held hostage. Investigators are talking to anyone who may have had contact with the money or knowledge about what happened to it, the source said, including military personnel on the warship, Navy SEALs who rescued Capt. Richard Phillips, and the crew of the Maersk Alabama. The NCIS and the Maersk Line Ltd., which owns the Maersk Alabama, have not responded to CNN's request for comment. In a criminal complaint filed against the one surviving alleged pirate, Abduwali Muse, the government contends the alleged pirate demanded money from the ship's captain and led him by gun point to the ship's safe.  Watch CNN's Chris Lawrence on the investigation » . ""The captain opened the safe and took out approximately $30,000 in cash. Muse and two other pirates then took the cash,"" the criminal complaint contends. It goes on to allege that Muse distributed some of the money to the other pirates who retreated to a lifeboat where they were holding the captain as a captive.  See timeline of events that led to piracy case » . All three of the other pirates were killed by U.S. Special Forces snipers during the rescue but the complaint does not list any money recovered from the boat after the rescue. It only lists rifles, a hand gun, artillery, cell phones and handheld radios.","The Naval Criminal Investigative Service opened an investigation into missing cash .

"(CNN) -- Former first lady Nancy Reagan has been released from a hospital after fracturing her pelvis during a fall at home last week, a spokeswoman said Friday. Former first lady Nancy Reagan is shown at an event in the nation's capital in September. Reagan, 87, returned to her Bel Air, California, home, spokeswoman Joanne Drake said. Doctors expect a full recovery, prescribing a regimen of daily physical therapy and a reduced public schedule, Drake said in a written release. The former first lady admitted herself to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Tuesday after experiencing what Drake described as ""persistent pain."" Tests revealed a fractured pelvis and sacrum, the triangular bone within the pelvis. She also was hospitalized for two days in February after a fall. President Reagan died in June 2004 after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. Since his death, Nancy Reagan has remained involved with the national Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute in Chicago, Illinois. However, she has appeared in public only rarely in recent years. Reagan expressed her thanks in the release Friday to all those who prayed for her and sent cards, flowers, phone calls and e-mails.","Nancy Reagan admitted herself to a hospital with a fractured pelvis Tuesday .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets in January, will tell her story in a book, although no publisher has been found to sell it, her lawyer said. In addition to her reality TV show, Nadya Suleman has met with a ghost writer for a book. Jeffrey Czech also confirmed details of a ""less-intrusive"" reality show about Suleman and her 14 kids, although no U.S. network has been signed to carry it. The advance money for the TV show deal will help Suleman pay her bills, Czech said. ""Obviously, she needs to do something more than just flip hamburgers all day,"" he said. Suleman was set to sign an agreement with a ghost writer for her book Monday, Czech said. While he would not name the writer, he said the two ""hit it off."" In addition to the eight children born this year, Suleman has six other children. All 14 were conceived through in-vitro fertilization. The TV deal was signed with the British division of EyeWorks, Czech said. Headquartered in the Netherlands, EyeWorks produces and distributes television programs in Europe, parts of South America, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Its U.S. productions include ""The Biggest Loser,"" which takes overweight participants through what producers call ""radical physical makeover without any kind of surgery."" ""EyeWorks is a strong company and they did offer some money up front, which is obviously attractive to a woman with her financial situation,"" Czech said. He would not reveal terms of the TV deal or how much money was involved. The show would be similar to what EyeWorks has produced in Europe, in which a camera crew does not follow the family every day, he said. It would, instead, record milestones and special events. Suleman will handle the camera for much of the taping of her TV show, reducing the intrusion into her children's lives by television crews, Czech said. Though he said the show has not been named, Suleman has sought to trademark her media nickname -- Octomom -- for a TV show and a line of diapers. Suleman has said no to some opportunities to make money, Czech said. She declined an offer from Vivid, a porn movie company, to star in its productions, he said. CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.","Nadya Suleman's lawyer says she's met with ghost writer; no publisher yet .

"(CNN)  -- Mauricio Funes was inaugurated Monday as El Salvador's president, promising to work for the nation's poor and disadvantaged. El Salvador's new president, Mauricio Funes, takes power Monday after his inauguration in San Salvador. Funes, elected March 15, is a member of a political party that waged guerrilla war against the government 17 years ago. He is El Salvador's first leftist president. ""The Salvadoran public asked for a change, and that change begins now,"" Funes said in an inauguration speech before an audience that included Latin American leaders and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Funes, a member of the FMLN party, won a narrow victory over the ARENA party's Rodrigo Avila. Funes' victory ended a 20-year hold on the presidency by the right-leaning ARENA. With Funes' win, El Salvador joined other Latin American countries that have elected leftist leaders in recent years -- Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Argentina, Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador and Brazil. The FMLN, which is the Spanish acronym for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, was formed in 1980 as an umbrella group for five leftist guerilla organizations fighting a U.S.-backed military dictatorship. The guerrillas and the government signed a peace pact in 1992, and the FMLN became a legitimate political party. By some estimates, 75,000 Salvadorans died during the war. The new president will find ""a country that still retains a lot of bitterness, a lot of division,"" Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, said before the election. ""This country is completely divided,"" ARENA party official Adolfo Torres said on CNN affiliate TCS TV on election night. Funes acknowledged that division Monday, promising to ""create a country without hate and without resentment."" He also seemed to acknowledge the difficulties ahead, saying, ""We don't have the right to make mistakes."" Despite a dire economy, Funes promised an ambitious social program that would include construction of 11,000 homes, scholarships for children ages 6 to 18 and improvement in delivery of water, electricity and sanitary services to 32 poor municipalities. He may be hard-pressed to follow through, some analysts said. ""Once Funes assumes office on 1 June, his government will face major challenges to boost the economy, cut government expenditures to trim the fiscal deficit and maintain support to the poor, who are being hit hardest by the economic downturn,"" analyst Heather Berkman wrote in a report last week for the Eurasia Group consulting firm. ""Cutting expenditures and reducing the deficit will be the most important challenges,"" Berkman wrote, adding that to ""do this, the Funes administration plans to cut government spending and eliminate redundant presidential commissions; retarget propane subsidies (and perhaps eventually eliminate them); and propose a number of new taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and new vehicles."" Funes campaigned on a platform of fiscal reform that aims to increase the government's tax take incrementally, Berkman said. Funes did not offer any details Monday, speaking instead in general terms of the El Salvador he would like to see under his five-year administration. He will not, Funes said, ""govern for a few or be complacent to corruption.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- I'm the mother of two daughters, a teen and a tween. So every day, I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions. The cervical cancer vaccine, approved in 2006, is recommended for girls around 11 or 12. As I tiptoe, I sometimes stumble, as any mother of girls that age knows. No adult woman in her right mind would knowingly, willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing, hurling verbal grenades such as, ""Thanks, Mom, for calling me fat, AGAIN."" Or ""Are you EVEN listening to me?"" Or any version of the very popular, ""I hate YOU,"" ""I hate you SO much,"" ""I hate this family,"" or just plain ""AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!"" followed by stomping feet and slamming doors. So given this background, you might understand why, when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls, I was braced for a fight. Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come. I told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor. ""I don't want to."" ""Well, sorry. You have to."" ""I heard it hurts."" ""Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life."" ""Oh. (pause) OK."" If you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win. The only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields. The HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly. ""There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus,"" he said. ""Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer.""  Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls » . In this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives. Given those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right? The hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of ""to give or not to give."" Let's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients. Merck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12. Ault explains why youth is key. Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted, ""so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active, so they will not have been exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine."" Another reason to do this early, Ault points out, is that ""our immune system is a lot better when we are 11 than when we are, say, at 22."" Ault also suggests that parents could use this experience to teach their children about sex and, even more important, about the realities of life, such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. These arguments aren't convincing to some parents, the ones that are choosing not to have their daughters vaccinated. There are several reasons for doing this, including religious beliefs. Some faith-based groups feel the vaccine is inviting their young daughters to become sexually active. Others believe the drug is just too risky. CDC spokesman Curtis Allen says the vaccine is constantly being monitored by a joint CDC /FDA hotline. Parents, patients and physicians can call the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, to report any adverse reaction to the vaccine. Through a Freedom of Information Act petition, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch  got records from VAERS that showed three deaths in girls who'd had the vaccine in March-April 2007 and over 1,600 adverse reactions reported from June 2006 to April 2007. All said the response came after getting the HPV vaccine. Allen cautions restraint in considering the reports. ""Most of these reactions were minor,"" he said, and the deaths ""were linked to circumstances not related to the vaccine."" The CDC and the FDA are constantly monitoring the VAERS hotline and won't hesitate to act should they see any dangerous trends due to the HPV vaccine, he said. The vaccine does have some known side effects. Ault has seen his share. ""I certainly hear from women who get the vaccine that it's painful, and I think some dizziness has been reported."" In fact, fainting has been added to the list of potential side effects to watch for. Allen says doctors are now recommending that girls stay in their doctor's office for a short period after they get the injection for just that reason. Three injections are necessary to get the full benefit of the vaccine. The shots need to be administered over a six-month period and at this stage are guaranteed to work for at least five years. All of this information leaves me confused. Frankly, I'm not really sure I have won myself over when it comes to the ""shot or no shot"" decision for my daughters. However, in the back of my mind, I hear the words a father spoke when he thought about not giving the vaccine to his still-young daughter. He said, ""How am I going to be able to turn to my daughter when she's older and tell her, 'When you were younger, I had the chance of making sure you never got a certain type of cancer, and I decided not to do it' ?"" That's an emotional minefield I truly don't think I'm emotionally equipped to walk through. E-mail to a friend .","Human papillomavirus, or HPV, can cause cervical cancer .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- A passenger jet caught fire early Sunday, exploded and crashed into railway tracks in the central Russian city of Perm, killing all 88 people on board. Wreckage from the Aeroflot-Nord Boeing 737, which crashed near Perm, lies across a railway track. The exact cause of the pre-dawn crash is under investigation, but government spokesman Vladimir Markin said ""a technical breakdown"" was a likely cause. Markin said in televised remarks that the failure of one of the Boeing 737-500's two engines may have caused the plane to come down, The Associated Press reported. Airline officials have said there is no indication of terrorism. ""We think it's very doubtful that it was the result of a terrorist attack, because at the scene, there were no traces of explosives as we know for now,"" said Lev Koshlyakov, Deputy Director General of Aeroflot. It took firefighters more than two hours to extinguish the blazing wreckage. When the sun rose, pieces of the Aeroflot jet were strewn about the railroad tracks. ""It slammed in front of my house, and there was a huge flame,"" an unidentified woman in Perm told Russian state television. ""It looked like fireworks."" She said the impact of the crash ""threw me across my sheets.... Then my daughter ran in from the next room and asked if a war had started."" She and other witnesses said they saw the aircraft burning before it came crashing down. ""It looked like a comet,"" she said. The jet was en route to Perm from Moscow when the pilots lost communication with air traffic control just before landing about 3:10 a.m. (2110 GMT), an Aeroflot official said. He described the weather at the time as ""mediocre."" The public safety minister for the Perm region said investigators were combing a 2.5-mile (4-kilometer) area, including homes and railways.  Watch more about the crash » . ""Right now, it's apparent that there was a fire on the plane at one kilometer in the air,"" Yuri Orlov said. ""After that, all contact was cut off -- the plane exploded."" The flight data recorder has been recovered and will be analyzed by the International Aviation Commission, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said. The plane carried 82 passengers, including seven children, and a crew of six. At least 21 non-Russians were on board, including passport-holders from Azerbaijan, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland and Ukraine, said Lev Koshlyakov, Aeroflot's deputy director general. The U.S. Embassy confirmed that no Americans were on board the flight, even though one passenger was listed as a U.S. citizen. It is the second crash in the region involving a Boeing 737 in less than a month. An Iran-bound Boeing 737 with 90 people on board crashed on August 24 just outside the airport in Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek, killing 68. The 737 is a workhorse of the airline industry, with thousands of planes in service. Aeroflot said the one that crashed in Perm was manufactured in 1992 and was operated by its Aeroflot-Nord subsidiary. ""This Boeing 737 has all the necessary certificates,"" Koshlyakov said. ""We conduct audits and inspections of all the affiliate companies we work with in the realm of their effectiveness, safety and reliability of the airplanes."" Airline safety in Russia and the former Soviet Union is among the worst in the world. Aviation experts say poor maintenance, inadequate pilot training and weak government controls are major factors. But Aeroflot is considered one of the safer airlines in the region. Sunday's crash is the first fatal accident for the airline since 1994, when a Russian pilot handed control of an Airbus to his 15-year-old son. It crashed, killing all 75 people on board. Russia's government has now ordered an inquiry into the latest incident, to find out how another routine flight could have ended in tragedy. The National Transportation Safety Board will send a team of investigators to Perm to look into the incident -- a standard practice when a U.S.-made aircraft crashes.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of inmates rioted at the Reeves County Detention Center in Texas on Saturday, the second disturbance at the prison facility in the last two months. As many as 2,080 inmates from two of the center's three buildings began fighting in the prison yard about 4:30 p.m. CT, said county Sheriff's Office Dispatcher Anna Granado. Authorities from several law enforcement agencies responded to quell the violence. However, officials had not brought the unrest under control as of 1 a.m. Sunday, according to the sheriff's office. Officials said they do not know what prompted the riots. Three inmates were hospitalized, including one with a severed finger, the sheriff's office said. On December 12, inmates took two workers hostage and set fire to the recreation area at the center in Pecos, located about 430 miles west of Dallas. The inmates, who had made several demands, surrendered later that night. The prison is a 2,400-bed, low-security facility, operated by Geo Group Inc. It houses federal prisoners as well as inmates from other states. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: Inmate unrest at Texas prison enters second day .

"(CNN) -- A drunk passenger tried to hijack a Turkish Airlines flight to Russia on Wednesday before he was brought under control, the head of Turkey's civil aviation authority said. The Turkish Airlines passenger jet was en route from Turkey to Russia when the incident took place. The plane landed safely and on time Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg. Russian authorities promptly arrested a ""slightly intoxicated"" passenger from Uzbekistan, Russia's Interfax News Agency reported, citing a national police spokesman. The suspect, in his early 50s, was arrested on suspicion of trying to hijack the plane, Interfax reported. Turkish media initially reported that the plane had been hijacked. When asked about those reports, a Turkish Airlines spokesman said the flight experienced an ""urgent situation"" as it headed to St. Petersburg, without offering further details. Interfax said the flight was carrying 164 Russian nationals. There have been several attempts to hijack Turkish airlines in recent years. In August 2007, two men hijacked an Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight with 136 passengers and crew on board from Cyprus, claiming to have a bomb on board the flight. They forced the crew to make an emergency landing in Antalya. Both hijackers eventually surrendered to Turkish authorities. In April 2007, Turkish authorities detained a man they believed tried to hijack a Turkish airliner, possibly to Iran. The suspect, Mehmed Goksin Gol, was not armed and all 178 passengers and crew aboard the Pegasus Airlines flight were unharmed. The flight was heading from southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir to Istanbul, but landed at Ankara's airport, where the suspect was detained. In October 2006, a Turkish man hijacked a Turkish jetliner with 113 people aboard en route from the Albanian capital Tirana for Istanbul. He forced it to fly to a military airfield in Brindisi, Italy, where the passengers and crew were released unharmed.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- North Korea is to blow up a key part of its controversial Yongbyon nuclear reactor on Friday. Hyun Hak-Bong (right), North Korea's deputy negotiator to six-party talks, crosses the border into South Korea on June 5. The destruction of the plant's cooling tower is part of an agreement with the United States aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula in exchange for loosening some restrictions on the highly secretive Communist country. The North Korean government has invited news organizations, including CNN, to witness the event. Earlier this year, Pyongyang agreed to disable its nuclear reactor and provide a full accounting of its plutonium stockpile, ""acknowledge"" concerns about its proliferation activities and its uranium enrichment activity, and agree to continue cooperation with a verification process to ensure no further activities are taking place. North Korea has been taking Yongbyon's main reactor apart, but imploding the cooling tower is an exceptionally important psychological step given that the highly recognizable shape of the structure is synonymous with nuclear power plants. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, says it would take a year to rebuild if North Korea decided to go back on its agreement, and that the construction could not be done in secret. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice defended U.S. diplomacy toward North Korea last week, saying the deal with Pyongyang made Asia and the U.S. safer. Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, Rice said that ""North Korea will soon give its declaration of nuclear programs to China."" China is the host of the six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program, along with Russia, South Korea, Japan and the United States. Rice spoke in advance of her upcoming trip to Asia where she will be attending a meeting of G8 foreign ministers and meeting with her Asian counterparts. Rice said once North Korea submits its declaration, President Bush will notify Congress he intends to remove North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and scrap some sanctions levied against North Korea because of nuclear concerns. But she noted that there would be no practical effect to loosening the restrictions because North Korea still was under the same sanctions because of other areas of U.S. law. Rice said a 45-day review would then begin to see if North Korea is telling the truth and living up to its end of the deal struck in the six-party talks. ""Before those actions go into effect, we would continue to assess the level of North Korean cooperation in helping to verify the accuracy and completeness of its declaration,"" she said. ""And if that cooperation is insufficient, we will respond accordingly."" The United States softened its demand that North Korea publicly admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and to providing Syria with nuclear technology, key unanswered questions that have left negotiations stalled for months. North Korea has already handed over about 18,000 documents on its nuclear past to the U.S., which the U.S. says are critical to verify North Korea's claims. Rice said that the deal with North Korea wasn't perfect but offered the U.S. the best chance to learn about North Korea's nuclear history. ""We must keep the broader goal in mind: the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons and programs, all of them,"" she said. ""North Korea has said that it is committed to this goal. We'll see."" Rice said that ""no final agreement can be concluded"" unless the U.S. verifies North Korea's claims.

"(CNN) -- Desperation, sophisticated smuggling operations and the emergence of a small Italian island as a migrant destination provide the sad backdrop to Monday's tragedy on the Mediterranean Sea -- the capsizing of a boat carrying African migrants from Libya to Italy. Libyan police officers help rescued migrants off an overcrowded boat that arrived this week in Tripoli. Jean-Philippe Chauzy, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said Tuesday that Libya for years has been a destination for migrants from the rest of Africa. Its relatively successful economy is a magnet for people from impoverished regions, and its proximity makes it a logical jumping-off point for Europe. People from places such as Ghana, Nigeria, Niger and Burkina Faso long have traveled to Tripoli and other Libyan locations and have gotten work there, from construction to washing cars. Chauzy said even people from the Horn of Africa, where Somalis and Ethiopians have fled to Yemen via the Gulf of Aden, are choosing to travel to Libya rather than pursue a trip to Yemen. Asians as well are opting to travel to Europe from Libya. While some Africans hope to settle in Libya, many others have their eyes on moving onward to Europe. They tend to sail to Lampedusa, an Italian island lying southwest of Sicily and just north of the African coast -- considered an advantageous way station for entrance into Europe. Italy has been bolstering its efforts to stop the illegal traffic. Some of the people who find their way to the island get asylum. Some migrants eventually are returned to their home countries, but others are taken from Lampedusa to facilities on the mainland, where they are sometimes simply released instead of being deported. Chauzy said people head to Europe first and foremost to help their families back home with a paycheck. He said the global economic crisis has led to a drop in the money sent back home, and that in turn has affected hurting African economies, where prices for staple crops have plummeted. He said that the bolstering of border controls sparked by such a tragedy could prompt migrants to take other dangerous routes.  Watch as details emerge on latest tragedy » . Officials said at least hundreds of migrants are believed to have perished in the Mediterranean over the past year. In the latest incident, more than 200 African migrants are believed to have died after their vessel, carrying 250 people, capsized in rough waters. At least 20 people are confirmed dead, and 23 have been rescued. Another boat with more than 350 migrants aboard was rescued, and these migrants -- mostly Africans but also including some Asians -- were taken to Tripoli in Libya. The International Organization for Migration believes there are two other boats in the Mediterranean that could be carrying migrants. The flight of migrants on rough seas is not just a local phenomenon. ""We are seeing it all over the world,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said Tuesday. Smugglers, for example, also take people from western Africa to the Canary Islands, from Myanmar to Thailand, and from Turkey to Greece. Guterres said the tragedy shows the urgent measures people take ""to escape conflict, persecution and poverty in search of a better life."" Some of the people can be classified as refugees -- people fleeing war and persecution and who could qualify for asylum in other countries. Others are migrants from countries where there is no persecution. They are in search of jobs and a better life. Thousands have died on their journeys, but thousands have survived as well, with many awaiting asylum and resettlement opportunities. There has been much publicity about the flight of Ethiopians and Somalis across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. Many have died en route, with smugglers at times throwing people overboard to avoid getting arrested by navies for their operations. Ron Redmond, the UNHCR spokesman, said he believes such movement will persist as the ""economic situation continues to worsen worldwide."" The agency said the number of asylum seekers in industrialized countries increased last year for the second year running, in part because of higher numbers of asylum applications by citizens of Afghanistan, Somalia and other turbulent nations. Last year, 36,000 people arrived in Italy by sea from North Africa. Some 75 percent of them applied for asylum, and about 50 percent of those received some form of international protection from the Italian authorities. Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of Washington-based think tank Migration Policy Institute, said the movement of migrants is organized, with smuggling syndicates making ""obscene profits"" and ""enormous amounts of money."" ""These are organized flows,"" Papademetriou said. As for the tragedy, ""you will see this again and again and again,"" he said.","Libya has long been a destination for migrants from the rest of Africa .
Many African migrants try to find work in industries such as construction .
Others attempt to move on to Europe, with Italy a common destination .

In ""Marley & Me,"" Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston's characters welcome a dog into their lives. He's friendly and lovable, but he devours everything in sight -- drywall, socks, big chunks of furniture (no, he doesn't just chew on them, he eats them). As a dog owner, I can testify that ""Marley & Me,"" based on the real John Grogan's smash 2005 memoir, is the single most endearing and authentic movie about the human-canine connection in decades. As directed by David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada""), though, it's also something more: a disarmingly enjoyable, wholehearted comic vision of the happy messiness of family life. John and Jenny share an existence that, from the standpoint of our current economic times, already looks like paradise. He's a reporter who gets refashioned, by his testy editor (Alan Arkin), into a lifestyle columnist (only to keep complaining about it -- poor guy!). She's a feature writer who becomes a stay-at-home mom. As the kids come along (three of them), the Grogans move into bigger and bigger houses, yet they have thwarted ambitions, fights that go on for days, and a general attitude of wistful loss toward all the freedoms they have given up to become parents. ""Marley & Me"" celebrates two ordinary people as they try to fit love, work, children, and one volcanically misbehaved pooch into a single space. Marley may be the dog from hell, but we're meant to see that the Grogans, in their hearts, wouldn't have it any other way. Marley stands in for all the unruliness that can never be domesticated out of life. You can domesticate Owen Wilson, but the shock is how good the role of beleaguered breadwinner looks on him. He and Aniston forge a nimble connection (they even get mad in style), and Wilson has a scene near the end with Marley that's the most wrenchingly tender acting of his career. Using his scratchy, lackadaisical warmth to voice a testament to family, and to where dogs fit into it, he makes you feel like it's a wonderful life indeed. EW Grade: A- .

"(CNN) -- Voluble real estate mogul Donald Trump called alleged Wall Street scam artist Bernard Madoff a ""sleazebag"" and ""a total crook"" Thursday in an interview on CNN. Donald Trump said investors who lost money in a Ponzi scheme were victims of their own greed. Trump recently hosted a party at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago, that was attended by several people who say they were victims of an alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme run by Madoff. Madoff, 70, is a former chairman of Nasdaq. He was charged last week with fraud. Trump, chairman and president of the Trump Organization, a New York-based real estate development empire, spoke with Kiran Chetry on CNN's ""American Morning."" CNN: How angry are people at this situation with Madoff? Donald Trump: ... The people in Palm Beach, many of those people have been just ripped off by this sleazebag, and they'll never see the kind of money that they've seen.  You have some people gave 100 percent of their net worth to him in trust, because they trusted him, they trusted his family, they trusted everybody, and now they literally are selling their houses in order to live. And some of them mortgaged their houses in order to give that money to this Madoff. And it's really a terrible thing. I'd see him around Mar-a-Lago, I'd see him around Palm Beach -- and he's a disgrace.  Watch the possible ramifications of the Madoff case » . CNN: ... How did he get away with this? How did so many smart people entrust somebody -- and we keep hearing over and over again, 100 percent of their money going to this guy. Would you ever let 100 percent of your money go to something, even if you trusted the person? Trump: I would not, and a lot of my friends would not, but obviously a lot of my friends did. The word is very simple. It's a word called ""greed."" Greed. That's all it is. People were greedy. They thought he was going to get them a little bit more return, or a lot more return. I mean, he was a Svengali for rich people. There are Svengalis for women; this guy was a Svengali for rich people -- very rich people. But when you think of a person putting up 100 percent of their net worth and even mortgaging their house, even though they had a lot of cash -- mortgaging their house to get more cash to this guy -- and now they're going to have to go out, literally, and maybe work in a drugstore. I don't know what they're going to do. CNN: Did you lose money from Madoff? Trump: No, I did not. CNN: Some are blaming the [Securities and Exchange Commission], saying for years they did not investigate any claims. Chairman Christopher Cox said there were some credible accusations against Madoff made nearly a decade ago that were never referred to the commission to act. So what's your take on the oversight, how the SEC and government handled this? Trump: I would not blame the SEC. This guy was a total crook. The people in his own organization supposedly didn't know about it. Now, that's another thing; I find that hard to believe. He's got two sons, and they didn't know about it? And they worked there for years? I think the whole thing is a swindle. I think even that's a swindle: The father said, ""Look, you guys turn me in and pretend you don't know anything and I'll save my two sons."" But it's impossible for me to believe that his sons didn't know about this. CNN: So you also think it's impossible that he acted alone. Trump: I don't know how you could act alone. They had three floors of a major office building. How could one man be manipulating that much money without all of the people knowing -- without at least a large number of the people knowing about it? So I would certainly think that his sons are guilty.","Real estate giant lashes out at suspect in $50 billion investment scheme .

"(AOL Autos) -- A directive recently handed down by a Detroit-area suburban mayor has ignited the latest round of a seemingly endless debate -- one that always burns with more intensity in the home of the Big Three than anywhere else. Many residents in the Detroit, Michigan area are auto workers. Thousands have been laid off recently. It's the debate that relates to cars and goes something like this: ""Buy American!"" vs. ""I'll buy what I want!"" That debate sometimes, but not always, begins as a civil conversation. But the Detroit area has been hit hard in the last five years by the ongoing, sometimes enormous financial losses posted by the Big Three. The Big Three's financial woes have had a direct impact on the Michigan economy with hundreds of thousands of layoffs and/or buyouts. Given that so many of the state's workers have lost their jobs -- and in some cases, their homes - it sometimes doesn't take long before the car debate escalates into an emotional one. That can lead to angry name-calling and insults - like many of the reader comments that flooded the online edition of the Detroit newspaper that first reported a controversial story. AOL Autos: Best new car deals this month . This latest round of the discussion was inspired by a decision made by Jim Fouts, the mayor of Warren, Michigan, a large Detroit suburb and Michigan's third-largest city, and where a good portion of the residents are (or were) autoworkers. In mid-August, Fouts told his department heads, which amount to 40 or 50 of the city's more than 700 employees that he ""expects"" the next car they buy will be an American model. More to the point, he expects them to drive General Motors or Chrysler vehicles, since both companies have various manufacturing or assembly plants in Warren -- not to mention GM's sprawling Tech Center -- and therefore are the city's two highest taxpayers. Fouts, who drives a 2001 Chrysler Concorde himself, isn't being draconian about it. That is, he hasn't ordered his appointees to run right out and dump their Hondas, Toyotas, Saabs or Audis immediately. ""But I strongly suggested that the next car they buy should be an American one, and that I had an equally strong expectation that they will do so,"" Fouts said. ""Legally, since they are 'at-will' employees, I have the right to mandate, and an expectation that they will meet that mandate."" AOL Autos: Best hybrid SUVs . Some have accused Fouts of over-stepping his authority by ""butting in"" to his employees' private lives, while others have given the policy a hearty ""thumbs up."" ""Some of them are not enthusiastic about it,"" Fouts said, noting that one department head currently drives a Mercedes-Benz vehicle. ""But many of these department heads make more than $100,000 a year, and I told them that they might not be able to enjoy the economic comforts they currently enjoy if it were not for the amount of taxes that GM and Chrysler pay to the city. AOL Autos: Luxury cars with the best MPG . ""I think of it as 'economic patriotism.'"" Fouts said he did not know how many of his department heads currently drive imports, although one of his appointees, Warren Police Commissioner Bill Dwyer, guessed that about 90 percent of the appointees already drive American-made cars. ""But the ones who are not happy about this -- well, they won't talk to [reporters] about that, because they know how I feel about it,"" said Fouts. Dwyer, who drives a Jeep Cherokee, supports the mayor's ""buy American"" expectation. ""I believe that, the way the economy is that Americans should be buying American cars. And, as department heads, I think it's important for us to be setting an example for the other city workers."" AOL Autos: Safest cars . One of the reasons usually cited for the U.S. automakers' loss of market share are consumer perceptions that imports are higher in quality -- although several recent surveys by various research groups have revealed that Detroit carmakers have closed the ""quality gap"" in recent years to the point that it is almost negligible. And the handful of Detroit-area residents/natives we talked to about the ""Buy American"" debate had no complaints about the quality of their American-made cars - or their foreign-made ones, for that matter. One is Tracy Balazy of Dearborn, Michigan - the Detroit suburb that is home to the Ford Motor Company's world headquarters. AOL Autos: Most popular crossover vehicles . ""I drive a 2000 Saturn, because it was cheaper than a Honda,"" Balazy said. ""And other than brakes and the usual things, I've had no problems with it, and it now has 101,000 miles on it."" Balazy has an interesting take on the topic of whether we should feel compelled to ""buy American,"" when it comes to cars, however - and whether we should be instructed to do so. ""The average American probably spends a lot more on other things - clothes, household goods, you name it - than on cars. I think it's hypocritical for someone to tell everyone to 'buy American' as it pertains to cars, but then take advantage of the great prices on imported goods at say, Wal-Mart,"" Balazy said. ""I've passed up many good deals, and have abstained from buying a lot of consumer goods I've wanted over the past year, just to avoid buying foreign-made products."" Ken Reibel, a Michigan native who's lived in Milwaukee for more than 20 years, drives a 2002 Mazda Protégé, while his wife motors around in a 2001 Toyota Corolla. ""We bought both of them used, from neighbors,"" he says. ""They've both been good runners. No serious problems. The Protégé is a sweet ride. ""But I'm not even sure what it means to 'Buy American' anymore,"" says Reibel. ""Ford has a huge stake in Mazda, and Japanese automakers build most of their cars for the American market right here in the U.S., with American labor. It's easier to 'Buy American' if you're purchasing a shirt or case of beer. But cars are different. I'm sure if you disassembled a Chevrolet Malibu or a Ford Windstar you would find an appalling number of foreign-made components and assemblies."" Gary Galusky is a Detroit-area native/resident who gives high marks to quality of his American-made vehicle. For the last couple of years, Galusky has actually maintained two residences: one in Dearborn and one in Sutton's Bay, in Northern Michigan - a five-hour drive. ""I make that commute regularly, about every three weeks, in a 2005 Ford Escape that I bought new. It now has 103,000 miles on it, and it's never required anything other than ordinary maintenance,"" says Galusky. Conrad Sutter grew up in Harper Woods, a Detroit suburb just a few miles from Warren, and now lives in Richland, in western Michigan. Sutter says he agrees with the ""Buy American"" sentiment. ""I believe what the mayor of Warren is doing is okay,"" says Sutter. ""I wouldn't suppose there are a lot of Apple Computers being purchased in Redmond, Washington (home of Microsoft Corp.), either. ""Nothing wrong with that.""","Detroit mayor sparks debate when he tells employees to buy American cars .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- A rocket fired by Palestinian militants fell on a Gaza home and killed two children, Palestinian sources said Friday, the same day Israel opened three Gaza border crossings for the first time in 10 days. A truck carrying grain enters Gaza from Israel on Friday at the Karni crossing point, one of three Israel reopened. A third child was in critical condition. The children, all girls, were cousins -- the two who died were 7 and 12, and the injured child is 5, Hamas security and Palestinian medical sources said. The rocket struck a house north of Gaza City. In a separate development, the Israeli military said it allowed a Palestinian who was badly wounded by rocket fire Wednesday to enter Israel for treatment. The Palestinian entered Israel through the Erez Crossing between northern Gaza and Israel. Israel closed the crossing for all but humanitarian reasons because of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel by Palestinian militants. But it opened three other crossings Friday, allowing fuel and commodities into the Palestinian territory for the first time in more than a week. About 80 trucks filled with commodities were expected to cross into Gaza. Among the goods were 400,000 liters of fuel and 120 tons of cooking gas. The decision to open the crossings at Kerem Shalom, Karni and Nahal Oz came after requests from international aid groups and Egypt, said Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. In addition, he said, Israel has no desire to hurt the civilian population in Gaza. Lerner said whether to keep the crossings open would be a daily decision. United Nations assistance programs in Gaza have run out of flour and several essential pharmaceuticals, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. A tenuous six-month truce between the Hamas government in Gaza and Israel expired a week ago. Under the Egyptian-brokered deal, Hamas agreed to end militant attacks on Israel from Gaza, and Israel agreed to halt raids inside the territory and ease its blockade on humanitarian goods. In reality, the truce started breaking down two months ago. Rocket attacks by militants became more frequent, and Israel resumed airstrikes inside Gaza. Since then, dozens of rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants into Israel. Israel Defense Forces said about nine rockets have been launched from Gaza since midnight, pushing the three-day total to more than 110. There are no reports of casualties in Israel. The crossings opened a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met in Cairo and Egypt expressed concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Livni criticized Hamas after her meeting with Mubarak. ""Hamas needs to understand that Israel's basic desire to live in a tranquil region doesn't mean that Israel is willing to accept ongoing shooting at its population,"" she said, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. ""Enough is enough. We cannot accept this situation, and the situation will change."" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has threatened to respond to the escalating violence. He warned Hamas again Thursday in an interview on the Al Arabiya television network and seemed to suggest that time was running out. ""We do not want to fight the Palestinian people, but we will not allow Hamas to strike our children,"" Olmert said. ""I did not come here to declare war,"" he continued. ""But Hamas must be stopped -- and so it will be. ""I will not hesitate to use Israel's strength to strike at Hamas and Islamic Jihad. How? I do not wish to go into details here.""","NEW: Militants' rocket hits Gaza house, killing Palestinian cousins .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- From the runway to the store rack, Vivienne Tam is one designer who uses creativity and business acumen in equal measure. Leading fashion designer Vivienne Tam spoke to CNN's Andrew Stevens in The Boardroom. Since her start in the fashion business in the early '80s and establishing her own brand in the '90s, she has risen to fame with her east-meets-west styles. Today it's her skills in business which have expanded the label to some 30 stores worldwide, from New York to Beijing. CNN's Andrew Stevens caught up with the designer in Hong Kong to talk about what it's like to lead both the business and creative direction of a global fashion line. Tam: The business side is like designing, it's like I like the touch of the fabric, I like to know the details about it. And you feel about it, you know about the deal, because who's the person who knows what the best deal for you is? Yourself. It's like designing clothes, I love to know how to solve every single thing, you know. Like what kind of budget . Stevens: It's just natural curiosity? Tam: Natural curiosity, I love it. I love every aspect of it. Stevens: Who have you learned your business skills from or have you made it up as you went along? Tam: I self-taught myself in business; I know nothing about the business, I learned everything -- about the pricing, the shipping, the contracts, everything -- by doing it. When you're doing it yourself, you know everything. If you don't do it, you just listen to somebody telling you how to do it, you're not experiencing it. Once you're experiencing it, you can grow so much from it. Once you experience it, you can go further, much further. It's a feeling of it. Stevens: When you won the Hong Kong businesswoman of the year award, you said that your mother was one of your greatest inspirations. How did she inspire you? Tam: She inspired me so much you know, like you say, the determination, persistence. When she really wanted to make something, she would really go to the end, she'd really want to make it happen and I see her, she's really the force behind me. We were quite poor, we had no money, my parents were working really hard. When I grew up, I saw them working so hard, and then deep inside myself that I wanted to change the situation, I wanted to make something, this one thing. Stevens: What do you think are the most important qualities for a businessperson? Tam: For me, it's most important, a vision, determination, and to never say no to yourself. And be open to criticisms, open to learning, and open to criticisms and knowing nothing about the business; nothing, so you can learn everything by knowing nothing, you know, and be successful in the things that you didn't know. Stevens: You work in a very creative industry, how do you keep your staff motivated in this industry, how do you keep them going, how do you keep them working for you? Tam: I always tell them my story, how I was in school when my teacher asked for one outfit -- I give them 8 outfits. I told them, do things that I didn't ask you, give me, do your work with passion, it's more important than ""Oh, 6 o'clock, I have to leave."" Do something that is out of the box.

"(CNN)  -- Two men were in custody and a third was still on the run Friday after the shooting of two police officers in Indiana sparked a manhunt across the Ohio River into Kentucky, authorities said. One of the injured officers is taken out of an ambulance and rushed into the University of Louisville Hospital. Vincent Windell, 22, and another man whose name was not released were in custody in connection with Thursday's shooting, Jeffersonville, Indiana, Chief Detective Charlie Thompson told CNN. A third suspect, Robert Dattilo, 37, fled into Kentucky, where Louisville police were pursuing him, according to Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley. The incident began Thursday when Jeffersonville Police Cpl. Dan Lawhorn, 39, and Patrolman Keith Broady, 32, responded to a call from a Motel 6 employee about possible drug activity, Thompson said. The two were apparently ambushed when they arrived, Indiana State Police told the Louisville Courier-Journal. Lawhorn, an 11-year veteran, was shot in the leg, and Broady, a 4-year veteran, was shot in the upper body, Thompson said. The two officers returned fire, but it wasn't clear whether the suspects were hit. Lawhorn and Broady were able to reach their patrol cars and call for help after the shooting. They were rushed to the University of Louisville Hospital for surgery and are both listed in serious but stable condition, hospital spokesman David McArthur told CNN.","Vincent Windell, 22, and another man in custody for Thursday's shooting .

"TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- There's probably no way to describe the feeling. Joe Pirrone's pride and joy, his F350 Super Duty turbo diesel truck, turned out to be a stolen ""clone."" One moment, Guiseppe ""Joe"" Pirrone was on a long weekend at the beach. The next moment, he found out the pickup that he bought a year ago is stolen, and he is still on the hook for the $27,000 loan. Stories like Pirrone's are scattered across the country, and Tuesday the FBI announced that it has broken up one of the largest auto theft cases in the U.S. Capping ""Operation Dual Identity,"" arrest warrants for 17 people were executed in Tampa and Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; and in Mexico City and Guadalajara, Mexico. The suspects were accused of ""cloning"" vehicles, which is making stolen cars look like legal ones. The FBI says that the ring was operating in the U.S. for more than 20 years. More than 1,000 vehicles were stolen in Florida, with more than $25 million in losses to consumers and banks. ""Individuals have been victimized at every level, from the average Joe, to the banks, to big companies,"" said Dave Couvertier, of the FBI's Tampa field office. Car theft rings clone vehicles by taking license plates, vehicle identification numbers (VIN), and other tags and stickers from a legal car and putting them on a stolen vehicle of similar make and model. ""This does not just affect big business. Anyone could become an unwitting victim of this particular scam. It could happen to anyone,"" said Couvertier. Pirrone knows how it was done because it happened to him. Last year, he bought a used 2005 F350 Super Duty turbo diesel pickup to use for his landscape business in Fort Myers, Florida. He bought it off a small used car lot and took out a $27,000 loan from a credit union. ""I had it for about nine months. It was a great truck,"" he told CNN. In the fall, Pirrone decided to drive across the state to spend a long weekend in Fort Lauderdale. He was lying on the beach when his father called him to tell him that a detective from the Lee County Sheriff's Office was at his house with a tow truck. Pirrone got back in his car and drove back home immediately. ""I was confused, honestly,"" he said. ""I had to ask the detective for credentials. I didn't believe what was going on."" Pirrone said the detective explained to him that he was the victim of a scam, that he was sold stolen goods. Left without a truck, Pirrone called the Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union. He found that his $536 a month payment would live on after his truck was long gone. Pirrone said he was able to get a 30-day payment exemption, but was told that he had a signed agreement with the bank, and he was still obligated to pay the loan in full. ""I am making payments on a piece of property that I don't have,"" Pirrone said. ""They can't even repossess it. The bank doesn't have any help to offer me."" The bank is a victim in the car cloning scam as well. Lisa Brock, a spokeswoman for Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union, told CNN that the company never discusses private information about any of its members. ""It is a police matter, and it's nothing we can make any substantial comment on,"" she said. Pirrone has hired an attorney, and he is considering filing a lawsuit against the dealership to get the bank's money back. Pirrone said he was advised by his lawyer not to name the used car lot. Law enforcement hopes that this is the beginning of the end of the ""car cloning"" scam. The National Motor Vehicle Information system (NMVTIS) database was implemented in January. It allows state DMVs to share title and registration information. Cloned vehicles were moved and sold to buyers in 20 states and several countries, often for less than market value, the FBI said. Many of the vehicles were exchanged for drugs, according to the bureau. The FBI says that people need to be careful when buying a car independently. ""Folks should be educated enough so that they don't buy a car from a stranger, on the street, or in a back alley somewhere,"" said the FBI's Dave Couvertier. ""And if you're getting it for too good a deal, it should be raising flags."" Like so many others, Pirrone is feeling the economic squeeze. Without a truck, he had to sell his landscaping business, which he had as a side business. He is still working his other job as a restaurant manager. ""It's not a good time for this to happen. I've had hours cut back at work, I'm not making what I used to make."" ""I don't know what's real anymore,"" he said. CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti contributed to this story.","FBI to announce 17 arrests in huge ""car cloning"" scam .

"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Friday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown praises Mark Felt, the Watergate case's ""Deep Throat."" (CNN) -- Cutting through the bull. It's hard to think of anyone who gave those words more meaning than Mark Felt. The man we all came to know as ""Deep Throat"" died Thursday at his California home after a life in the shadows. His willingness to risk everything -- career, family, and even his safety -- helped bring down President Richard Nixon in disgrace. Felt was the No. 2 man at the FBI. And yes, it's fair to say he had an ax to grind after being snubbed for the top job.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary » . But that didn't make his information less accurate or crucial. And even after taking that huge risk, he gave up all kinds of chances to cash in on his secret identity. Imagine the book deal ""Deep Throat"" would have gotten or the movie rights to a blockbuster like ""All the President's Men""? What millions did he lose by not spending years on the lecture circuit? No, Felt's willingness to keep Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward pointed in the right direction as Woodward and Carl Bernstein flushed out the greatest political scandal in American history had its roots in the integrity that no one else would show back then. We remind you of this because the timing of Felt's death is not lost on us. Just this month, we've watched a governor accused of redefining crooked politics in Illinois. We're in the final days of a White House that pushed the limits of the Constitution and never appeared eager to share information with the American people. And just this week, the president-elect, who talks of change, tried to stop a journalist from finishing a question at a news conference. Now, as ever, we need people like Woodward and Bernstein to keep asking questions. But more importantly, we need people brave enough to give the answers. People like Mark Felt. A man whose name you never heard until he finally surfaced near the end of his life. By then, he was a quiet, meek-looking person who changed our country forever -- by cutting through the bull. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.","Mark Felt, Watergate's ""Deep Throat"" dies .

"(CNN) -- Hanny van Arkel was poring over photos of galaxies on the Internet in August 2007 when she stumbled across a strange object in the night sky: a bright, gaseous mass with a gaping hole in its middle. Hanny van Arkel made her discovery by poring over images of galaxies on an astronomy Web site. ""It looked a bit like an irregular galaxy, but I wasn't sure what it was,"" Van Arkel said. So she posted a query on the Web site of the Galaxy Zoo project, which encourages members of the public to join in astronomy research online. Van Arkel is a 25-year-old schoolteacher in Heerlen, The Netherlands, not an astrophysicist. But her startling find -- a mysterious and unique object some observers are calling a ""cosmic ghost"" -- has captivated astronomers and even caught the attention of the people who run the Hubble Space Telescope, who have agreed to take a closer look next year. ""This discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the Internet world,"" said Bill Keel, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Alabama and a Galaxy Zoo team member. ""There was a time when I spoke pejoratively of armchair astronomers. And I've gotten up at a star party and publicly apologized for that."" Not so long ago, the term ""amateur astronomer"" conjured images of stargazers peering through backyard telescopes. But today's are as likely to be analyzing reams of sophisticated data collected by observatories and posted on space-related Web sites. Armchair observers like van Arkel increasingly are making significant contributions to science, said Steve Maran, spokesman for the American Astronomical Society, a group of 6,500 professionals. Amateurs have been invited to present papers at recent AAS conferences, ""which wouldn't have happened years ago,"" he said. A successful example of amateur-professional collaboration, the Galaxy Zoo project was launched last year by Yale University astrophysicist Kevin Schawinski and Chris Lintott at the University of Oxford in England. The pair were looking for help in cataloging archived photographs of galaxies -- one million images -- taken by the robotic Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope in remote southern New Mexico. Knowing that the human eye is sometimes more sensitive than a computer at picking out unusual patterns -- and that they didn't have time to do all the work themselves -- Schawinski and Lintott posted the images on the Galaxy Zoo Web site last summer. The professors then invited amateur astronomers, with the help of a brief online tutorial, to classify the galaxies as spiral, elliptical or something else. Online galaxy-sorting might not sound as fun as, say, surfing YouTube, but it was an immediate hit. ""We were overwhelmed by the response. It completely melted the server,"" Schawinski said. ""People tell us it's addictive. Some of [the volunteers] are professional astronomers, but most of them are not. They're just regular people who got excited about the project."" During the past year, more than 150,000 armchair astronomers from all over the world volunteered their time, submitting more than 50 million classifications. The public's collective wisdom -- the same principle that guides jury trials or Wikipedia -- proved remarkably astute, Schawinski said. For example, if 33 of 36 volunteers thought a galaxy appeared elliptical, then astronomers could be confident the classification was correct, he said. Van Arkel had been classifying photos on Galaxy Zoo for about a week when she came across the image that quickly became known as ""Hanny's Voorwerp,"" Dutch for ""object."" The primary school teacher does not own a telescope -- ""my [astronomy] background doesn't really go further than looking at the stars when walking outside in the evening,"" she said -- but when she posted her finding August 13 on the Galaxy Zoo forum, the astronomers who run the site began to investigate. They soon realized van Arkel might have found a new class of astronomical object. The Galaxy Zoo team asked scientists working at telescopes around the world to take a look at the mysterious Voorwerp. Their best guess: The Voorwerp is probably a cloud of hot gas punctured by a central hole 16,000 light years across and illuminated by the ""dying embers"" of a nearby quasar, Schawinski said. Quasars are distant, highly luminous astronomical objects powered by black holes; scientists suspect that light from the quasar still illuminates the Voorwerp even though the quasar itself burned out in the past 100,000 years. ""It's this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe,"" said Lintott, the Oxford scientist. ""It's rather like examining the scene of a crime where, although we can't see them, we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows."" Galaxy Zoo leaders are eagerly awaiting images from NASA's orbiting Hubble, which is scheduled to train its powerful instruments on the Voorwerp in 2009. In the meantime, van Arkel is enjoying the fuss over her contribution to astronomy. ""It's amazing to think that ... amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online,"" she said. ""What excites me the most is that all of this leads to more interest in science.""","Using the Web, a Dutch schoolteacher has discovered a strange astronomical object .

"KINGSTON, Tennessee (CNN)  -- The Environmental Protection Agency has found high levels of arsenic and heavy metals in two rivers in central Tennessee that are near the site of a spill that unleashed more than a billion gallons of coal waste. Four days after the spill, the water is cloudy on the east bank of the Clinch River in Kingston, Tennessee. The agency said it found ""several heavy metals"" in the water in levels that are slightly above safe drinking-water standards but ""below concentrations"" known to be harmful to humans. ""The one exception may be arsenic,"" the agency said in a letter to an affected community. ""One sample of river water out of many taken indicated concentrations that are very high and further investigations are in progress."" However, arsenic was not detected in a water intake facility near Kingston, Tennessee, where the spill happened, said EPA spokeswoman Laura Niles. The metals were found in the Emory and Clinch rivers, near the site of a major spill last week that unleashed enough sludge to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools. The EPA's letter comes as the head of the largest public power company in the nation pledged to clean up the massive spill. ""This is not a time where TVA holds its head high,"" said Tom Kilgore, president and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority. ""But we won't hang our head, either, because that won't get the job done. I'm here to tell you that we will clean it up, and we will clean it up right."" The sludge is a byproduct of the ash from coal combustion. A retention site at the Tennessee Valley Authority's power plant in Kingston, about 40 miles west of Knoxville, contained the waste until a wall breached last Monday, sending the sludge downhill to damage 15 homes and cover at least 300 acres. All residents in the area were evacuated, and three homes were deemed uninhabitable, according to the TVA. The TVA's initial estimate for the spill tripled from 1.8 million cubic yards, or more than 360 million gallons of sludge, to 5.4 million cubic yards, or more than 1 billion gallons. The plant sits on the Clinch River, which is a tributary of the Tennessee River. Video footage from the river, a popular fishing site, reveals piles of dead fish on its banks. The TVA says that has nothing to do with the toxicity of the sludge, though environmental advocates say the ash contains concentrated levels of mercury and arsenic. TVA officials have said water quality tests from a nearby water treatment facility have shown that the water from the river intake meets federal and state guidelines for potable water. But coal operation critics remain concerned about the long-term effects of the spill, and residents have expressed concerns about drinking water, especially from wells. Roane County Emergency Management Director Howie Rose said the county has asked the state and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to monitor groundwater from wells around the area. He and Kilgore spoke at a town hall meeting Sunday. Rose said the county has also requested air quality tests from the state and federal agencies. Steve Ahlstedt, an independent aquatic biologist, told CNN that a spill of this magnitude probably will affect the area's ecological balance. ""Once the ash has settled to the bottom of the rivers, all heavy metals will hang around for a long time,"" he said. ""When coal releases into the water, the mussel population goes into deep freeze. They are the 'canary in the coal mine.' They are the main indicator of how healthy our water is.""

"(CNN) -- The leader of a religious group that authorities believe preys on children was released from a Pennsylvania prison Friday but won't be required to register as a sex offender, triggering outrage in the community where he plans to live. George Feigley, who was released from prison Friday, is the subject of community protests. George Feigley, now 68, was convicted in 1975 on charges including statutory rape, indecent assault and corrupting the morals of minors. Because Feigley's 1975 conviction predated the passage of Megan's Law, he will not be required to register as a sex offender. And, having served his maximum sentence, he was not put on parole upon his release. Feigley's Neo American Church, which authorities have called a sex cult, operated a school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that police said was a front for sexual activity. The church's manifesto says, ""We hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity,"" according to community activist Scott Portzline, who has researched Feigley's history and that of the group. ""Sexual activity is the greatest act a human can do."" Court documents filed in connection with Feigley's criminal case alleged a less lofty goal. ""The defendants' design was to operate a 'church oriented' school, which is free of any governmental regulation, for the ostensible purpose of education when their real goal was to gratify their own deviant sexual desires,"" the documents stated. One of Feigley's victims, identified only as ""J,"" told the Harrisburg Patriot-News she was part of the organization from the ages of 5 through 12, when her mother left the Neo American Church. Children were beaten for letting anyone but fellow cult members see them, she said, and their genitals were pierced with a lock to be controlled by Feigley, who called himself ""The Light of the World."" Children also were photographed in graphic sexual poses, she said. Feigley is ""not a man who should be out with society,"" J said. ""He preys on -- at least he did -- the people who believed in him."" And, community members say, there will be no protections in place to stop him from continuing to do so.  Watch why the case inflames emotions » . Feigley was convicted of additional conspiracy charges in 1995. Authorities said he was attempting to direct sexual activity involving children by telephone from prison. However, conspiracy charges do not require listing on a sex offender registry. Feigley ""never admitted what he did was wrong,"" said John Goshert of the Dauphin County district attorney's office, who interviewed him last week as part of a pre-release program. Protests took place Friday in front of Feigley's Harrisburg home and the church headquarters. His wife, Sandra, still lives in the home. She was convicted in 1975 on one count of corrupting the morals of minors. She served a brief prison sentence, according to the Patriot-News. Sandra Feigley now operates a Web site ostensibly aimed at benefiting state, local and federal prison inmates. The site has a lengthy section with articles discussing sex in prison and elsewhere. Some of them are written by George Feigley, using his own name and some of his aliases. ""Thanks to the Christian crazies who were and are so influential in this country, America has criminalized more sexual conduct than any other Western nation,"" says an article on the site, which does not name an author. ""It's a neurosis. As a result, there are a lot of 'sexual offenses.' "" Another article bearing George Feigley's alias of G.G. Stoctay, Ph.D., and included in Portzline's research says, ""There is nothing injurious to sexuality. It's good and pleasant, not an evil. Children exposed to it are simply not injured."" Angel Fox, who will be Feigley's next-door neighbor, helped organize Friday's protest and is circulating a petition to prevent his return to the neighborhood, according to the Patriot-News. ""I mean, what happens when I'm not at home?"" she asked. ""Do I have to worry about what's happening with my kids? I have to try to do something."" The community is ""outraged,"" said Annette Antoun, publisher of a weekly newspaper. She said authorities are looking into whether Feigley would be required to register under a federal statute. And, she said, if there is a loophole in the law, legislators are starting to work on ways to close it. She said she has spoken to Feigley's victims, and ""they have scars they say will never go away. ... They're frightened."" In 1976, Feigley escaped from a Pennsylvania prison. He was captured two years later in West Virginia but escaped again from a local jail and was recaptured by the FBI. In 1983, two members of the Neo American Church drowned in what authorities believe was an attempt to break Feigley out of prison. Laura Seligman and James Gilbert drowned in the sewer line outside the prison where Feigley was being held. The two had crawled a mile and a half through the line, according to Portzline. A rainstorm caused an overflow gate to open, flooding the line. CNN's Aurore Ankarcrona contributed to this report.","Feigley was convicted before passage of Megan's Law .

"Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune. Read his column here . Ruben Navarrette says Sarah Palin's critics challenged her  because of prejudices about small-town values. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- During the presidential election, some Democrats demanded to know how I could defend Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Simply put, Palin is my people. She's small-town folk who wound up in the big leagues. Because I grew up in a small town with a population of less than 15,000 people, I was disgusted by the insults and condescension coming from those who think of themselves as the enlightened elite. Meanwhile, in small towns, I detected great affection for Palin. People talked about how she was ""a real person"" who ""reflected their values."" The most significant divide in America isn't Red State vs. Blue State, it's rural vs. urban. The country mouse and the city mouse are still slugging it out. In 1982, New York Mayor Ed Koch ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York. Some say the deciding factor was when Koch described life in upstate New York as ""sterile"" and said he dreaded living in the ""small town"" of Albany, if elected. That didn't play well in rural areas. Now comes Colin Powell. During a recent appearance on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" Powell attempted an autopsy on the Republican Party's failed presidential bid. He went after Palin, accusing her of pushing the party so far to the right that it went over a cliff. ""I think [Palin] had something of a polarizing effect when she talked about how small-town values are good,"" Powell said. ""Well, most of us don't live in small towns. And I was raised in the South Bronx, and there's nothing wrong with my value system from the South Bronx."" You'd think the presidential campaign was about conservatives picking on urbanites. It wasn't. Sure, some Republicans probably made a mistake by using phrases such as ""real America"" or ""real Americans"" as a rallying cry for the base. Americans who live in cities might have thought they were being slighted. But those phrases referred as much to people's politics and values as it did their zip code. I live in a city with a population of more than a million people and I never thought the GOP singled me out as not being a ""real American."" If anything, it appeared that big-city liberals were tapping into prejudices about small-town America to belittle the governor of Alaska . After Powell attacked Palin, one of the governor's most vocal defenders, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, returned the favor by attacking Powell. ""What is this hatred for conservatives and small-town people and Sarah Palin?"" Limbaugh asked on his radio show. ""I know a lot of people that are from the Bronx, Gen. Powell, and if you think the values there in the Bronx today reflect the ones you grew up with, take a trip back and see if the street corners and the activities there are the same as when you were growing up."" Limbaugh got it. When people use phrases such as ""small-town values,"" it's as much about time as it is place. The idea isn't that people who live in small towns have better values than people who live in cities. It's simply an attempt to recall, with nostalgia, what life was like when more Americans lived in small towns. It used to be that more families ate dinner together and high school students worked summers and after school. It used to be that our schools didn't make excuses for why some kids don't learn because they were too busy trying to teach them. It used to be that parents weren't interested in being their kids' best friends, only good parents. And it used to be that people pulled their own weight and would never dare ask for a handout. During a recent interview with the conservative newspaper, Human Events, Palin was asked if she thought her humble background accounted for some of the flak she got from the media. Palin acknowledged that she didn't come from elite stock, but said that she was grateful for that. ""I got my education from the University of Idaho because that's what I could afford,"" she said. ""No, I don't come from the self-proclaimed 'movers and shakers' group and that's fine with me. It's caused me, or rather, allowed me, to work harder and pull myself up by my bootstraps without anyone else helping me. I think it allows me to be in touch with the vast majority of Americans who are in the same position that I am."" Sarah Palin understands a lot about America. Too bad many Americans don't understand Sarah Palin. No worries. They may get another chance to acquaint themselves with her -- in say, four years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Sarah Palin rose from small-town life to big-time politics .
She's been accused by Democrats of polarizing the campaign, Navarrette says .
He says she was unfairly targeted by liberals prejudiced against small towns .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton will win Florida's Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, CNN projects, although party sanctions have stripped the state of its convention delegates and no Democrats campaigned there. Hillary Clinton addresses a crowd in Davie, Florida, after winning the state's primary. Published polls showed the New York senator and former first lady was heavily favored in the state. Her leading rivals, South Carolina primary winner   Sen. Barack Obama and  Sen. John Edwards, did not campaign in Florida. They opted to concentrate on next week's ""Super Tuesday"" contests in states such as New York, California, Missouri and Georgia. CNN's projection is based on precincts reporting results, entrance polls and other statistical models -- including the number of votes outstanding in areas where Clinton was expected to do well. The sanctions make Tuesday night's results largely meaningless to the Democratic presidential race. Obama described the primary as a ""beauty contest"" Tuesday, and his campaign issued a statement declaring the race a tie in the delegate count: ""Zero for Obama, zero for Clinton."" But Clinton has pledged to fight to have the state's delegates seated at the August convention in Denver, and has increasingly stressed the state's importance since losing Saturday's hotly contested primary in South Carolina to Obama. Though Democrats agreed to leave the state off their itineraries in a show of solidarity with the national party, Clinton attended permitted fund-raisers in Florida on Sunday and planned to appear with supporters there after polls closed. And turnout was high for the race even though no delegates were at stake. Nearly 400,000 people cast early or absentee ballots ahead of the primary, and Tuesday's vote was expected to top the nearly 800,000 who turned out in 2004. Donna Brazile, who managed former Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid, said many Democrats were likely to turn out to vote on a state constitutional amendment that would limit property tax increases and expand homestead exemptions. ""People are very afraid this will cut public services, cut back education,"" said Brazile, a CNN analyst.

"AMSTETTEN, Austria (CNN)  -- Austrian police believe a 73-year-old man held his daughter captive in his cellar for the past two decades and fathered at least six children with her, according to police and state-run news reports Sunday. The woman, identified as 42-year-old Elisabeth F., has been missing since 1984, when she was 18 years old, police said at a news conference. The situation came to light earlier this month after her daughter -- a 19-year-old woman, identified as Kristen F. -- was hospitalized in Amstetten after falling unconscious, according to police. She was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten, outside Vienna, by her grandfather with a note from her biological mother requesting help. Amstetten is a rural town about 150 km (93 miles) west of Vienna. But police said a DNA test later revealed her grandfather, Josef F., was also her father, according to ORF, Austria's state-run news agency. That sparked a police investigation, which revealed that Josef F. may have fathered at least six children with his daughter, forcing her and three of the surviving children to live in the cellar of his house, according to ORF's Peter Schmitzberger. The children are now between 5 and 19 years old. Police are awaiting DNA tests to verify their relationship to Josef F., who faces arrest for ""severe crimes against family members,"" according to police. So far, he has not given a statement to police. Police spokesman Franz Polzer told ORF that the 73-year-old has led police to several hidden rooms in his cellar accessible only by an electronic passcode that he provided to police.  Watch a report on the discovery » . On Sunday, police searched the hidden rooms where Josef F. admitted he kept his daughter and their children, Polzer told ORF. The rooms included sleeping quarters, a kitchen and a bathroom, which Josef F. told police he built, Polzer said. Neighbors told ORF they were shocked to hear the news, and had no indication such horrors were taking place in their town. ""One can't imagine how it could happen, how nobody could realize anything of what was going on in the cellar of this house,"" Schmitzberger told CNN. ""It's quite unimaginable."" Acting on ""a confidential tip,"" Amstetten police apprehended Josef F. and Elisabeth F. on Saturday near the hospital for questioning, according to a police statement. Once police assured the daughter that she would never have contact with her father again, ""she was able to tell the whole story,"" Schmitzberger said. Josef F. lived upstairs with his wife, Rosemarie F., who police said had no idea about her husband's other family living in the cellar. Josef F. and Rosemarie F. had adopted three of the children that he had with his daughter, according to police. He told his wife that his missing daughter had dropped the unwanted children off at the house because she could not take care of them, police said. The other three children -- Kerstin, 19; Stefan, 18; and Felix, 5 -- remained locked in the basement with their mother, according to police. None had seen the light of day during their entire time in captivity, police said. After she was detained Saturday, Elisabeth F. gave police a ""psychologically and physically disturbed impression,"" police said in a statement. She told them her story after she was assured her children would be protected from further harm. She said her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984 -- weeks before she was reported missing -- her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room, she told police. For the next 24 years, she was constantly raped by her father, resulting in the six surviving children, she said, according to the police statement. She told police she gave birth to twins in 1996, but one of the babies died a few days later as a result of neglect, and Josef F. removed the infant's body and burned it. She told police that only her father supplied her and her children with food and clothing, and that she did not think his wife knew anything about their situation. When Kerstin fell ill earlier this month, Josef F. apparently told his wife and the hospital that his ""missing"" daughter had dropped off the sick girl on his doorstep. In an effort to find out what might be ailing 19-year-old Kerstin, the hospital asked the media to put out a bulletin requesting any information about the girl or her missing mother, attorney general Gerhard Sedlacek told NTV. Sometime later, Josef F. brought Elisabeth F. out of the cellar, telling his wife that she had returned home with her two children after a 24-year absence, police said. He took Elisabeth F. to the hospital to talk with doctors about Kerstin's condition, and at that point, authorities became aware of her situation, Sedlacek said. E-mail to a friend .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida boy remains in stable condition just days after he found his parents' long-forgotten handgun in a closet and accidentally shot himself in the head. Police are deciding whether or not to charge parents after their son found a forgotten gun and shot himself. Sheriff's detectives in Pinellas County, Florida, near St. Petersburg, say the boy found the .25-caliber European semi-automatic handgun in a box in a closet in their home. ""They are dealing with this very tragic situation, and at this point, no charges have been filed,"" said Cecilia Barreda of the Pinellas County sheriff's office. His stepfather found Jacob Larson, 12, with a gunshot wound to the head Friday. The stepfather called 911. Police say the shooting took place between 7:40 a.m., when his mother, Tracy Newman, leaves for work, and about 11 a.m., when his stepfather, Joseph Newton, returns home. The boy normally goes to school about 8:30 a.m. ""A few years ago, they moved, and [the gun] was stored in the closet. The mother never checked it, never fired it,"" Barreda said. ""They told detectives that they forgot they had stored it in a box inside a closet. Both her and her husband forgot about it,"" she said. Newman told detectives that she received the gun six years ago from a former employer. Police say that both she and her husband are cooperating in the investigation into the incident. The sheriff's office says it's unlikely that they will face charges. Florida law prohibits a person from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor might have access to it. Prosecutors do have some discretion, and depending on what happens with the gun, charges ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony can be filed in the event of death or serious injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 17 states have child firearm access protection and safe-storage laws. Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett says that although laws are needed, an accident with a firearm can be a greater penalty than any judge could ever hand down. ""Sometimes, the injury of a child is more severe from a punishment standpoint than any kind of criminal charge,"" he said. The CDC says three children per day, on average, died in accidental incidents in the United States from 2000 to 2005, the last year data are available. Bartlett said his office has filed charges in previous cases when there was culpable negligence on the part of a gun owner. But, he says, there are cases where accidents happen, not crimes. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says that 34 percent of children in the United States live in homes with at least one firearm, so people have to be aware. ""It's a horrible thing, and those parents will blame themselves from here out, and you have to look at things real close to see if it warrants any enforcement from our end,"" Bartlett said.","Boy, 12, found .25-caliber gun in box in closet .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Five members of the Sri Lanka's Civil Defense Force (CDF) were killed in a suicide blast in Sri Lanka at a church outside the capital of Colombo Sunday morning, police said. Sri Lankan police officers investigate Sunday's suicide bombing near Colombo. Eight other CDF officers and two civilians were wounded, police said. Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but police suspect the bomber was a member of the Tamil Tiger rebels. There was no immediate response from the Tamil Tiger rebels to the incident, which, police said, occurred at St. Anne's Church in the Colombo suburb of Wattala, located on a roadway to the country's only international airport about 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of the capital. The attack happened during a weekly festival that usually draws a large crowd shopping for vegetables and household goods. The suicide bomber walked into an area where CDF officers were stationed and detonated his explosives, police said. Investigators suspect the bomber targeted the area because 150 police officers who help patrol the road to the airport are billeted there. Government forces have engaged rebels in heavy fighting for more than a year in the Kilinochchi region, once the center of political power for the Tamil Tigers. The 25-year civil war between ethnic Tamil separatists and the Sri Lankan government has left more than 65,000 people dead. The Tamil Tigers were founded in 1976, and the U.S. State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. The rebels, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), are fighting for the creation of an independent nation, citing discrimination by the country's Sinhalese majority. Earlier Sunday, Sri Lanka's navy said it had destroyed a Tamil Tiger rebel boat allegedly attempting to smuggle in military supplies through the northern coast. Commander D.K.P. Dissanayake, a navy spokesman, told CNN that four rebels were killed in attack after the boat was engulfed in fire. He said the incident occurred just after midnight Sunday but gave no other details. There was no immediate response from the Tiger rebels to that incident. CNN could not independently verify the government's claim because media is debarred from Sri Lanka's battle zones. In the past, both sides in the conflict have exaggerated accounts of military operations. On December 20, the Navy said it destroyed a similar rebel boat trying to smuggle military supplies through the coast near the northeastern coastal village of Mullaitivu. However, a second supply boat was caught on Air Force aerial surveillance cameras unloading along the coast. ""They included assorted ammunition, artillery shells, mortar shells and other items,"" a senior Air Force official told CNN. He spoke on grounds of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media.","NEW: Attack coincided during a weekly festival that draws a large crowd .

"(CNN) -- Lectures, slide shows and notes are often boring, but people are using technology to find entertainment in these unlikely places. Spoof notes of ""Star Wars"" are scribbled into a fun online ""pencast."" Some use high-tech pens to track presentations. Others share PowerPoints in slide show form online. These technologically spiced-up presentations seem to be getting more attention these days. They're also creating buzz about what the future of presentations might hold. Consider ""pencasts,"" which are made using the Pulse SmartPen and specially gridded paper, both sold by the California startup Livescribe. The pen writes like an ordinary pen but also has a voice recorder, and it ""notes"" (so to speak) which notes were taken at which point in the recording. Some quirky SmartPen presentations come off as comedy sketches. One popular presentation muses about how George Lucas might have come up with the idea for Star Wars. Some university students love the technology because they can record and play back what their professor was saying at an exact point in their notes -- which is especially useful when you can't read your own writing. And many professors are all for it, too. ""I feel like this is one of those 'Rear View Mirror' moments in which a new technology comes into our lives with enormous potential and we just don't know what to do with it yet,"" blogs Michael Wesch, a cultural anthropology and digital ethnography professor at Kansas State University. ""We think of it in terms of what we know (pen and paper) and fail to recognize the potential."" That potential -- for entertainment and serious uses alike -- can be gleaned from pencasts posted on the Livescribe Web site's community section, which is about a year old. The pencasts posted there have collectively received more than 1.5 million views. Soon, it will be easier to embed pencasts on other sites, like personal blogs, the company says. Slide shows are further along in popularity. A startup called SlideShare launched in late 2006 with the idea of allowing people to easily share their PowerPoint presentations. Its site had more than 15 million visitors last month, and its 2008 contest for the best presentations showed off the form's potential. The best are far removed from the dull bullet-point presentations you might have fallen asleep to. Many use dramatic images, striking design and memorable phrases. Former Vice President Al Gore developed his presentation on the planet's environmental challenges into the Academy Award-winning documentary and best-selling book ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Last year's top SlideShare presentation, called ""Thirst,"" highlights the looming water crisis and has nearly 200,000 views. Others are more light-hearted. The No. 2 spot (with more than 60,000 views) went to a presentation called ""Foot Notes."" It shows pictures of the narrator's feet in various places she's been (like on cobblestone corridors in Prague and a dance floor in Chicago), interspersed with inspiring quotes related to feet and walking. Finally, for many people, the most dreaded, boring form of communication of all is the lecture. But then, how to explain the popularity of the TED videos? TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design. The conference started in the mid-'80s and has become a networking event of sorts for the world's best and brightest. Dozens of speakers give presentations of about 20 minutes each -- the perfect duration for a juicy ""media snack."" TED.com started introducing TEDTalks to the public for free in July 2006, and by the following year, there were more than a hundred talks dating back to 2002. Broken down into dozens of themes, today they're popular fodder for video iPods. In one, the amputee athlete and model Aimee Mullins talks about how her many pairs of artificial legs often beat having a single pair of regular ones -- some make her taller, others are works of art. In another, Jill Tarter, an astronomer and director of the Center for SETI Research, discusses how insanely large the universe is and what a ""waste of space"" it would be if life on Earth were indeed all there is. It's hard to watch a handful of TED videos and not feel your perspective broadening. That helps explain how, despite the lecture format, TEDTalks has become hugely popular. A few months ago, the videos surpassed the 100 million views mark -- not bad for a bunch of lectures.","Technology injects new life into a dull medium: presentations .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on Thursday convicted the ""mastermind"" of the Rwandan genocide and sentenced him to life in prison for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Theoneste Bagosora, right, and his co-defendant Anatole Nsengiyumva, left, arrive in court. It is the first time the tribunal has convicted high-level officials for the 100-day genocide in 1994 which left an estimated 800,000 people dead. Theoneste Bagosora, 67, a colonel in the Rwandan army, was found guilty along with two other men -- Major Aloys Ntabakuze and Lieutenant Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva. All were sentenced to life in prison. The tribunal -- located in Arusha, Tanzania -- acquitted General Gratien Kabiligi, the former head of military operations, and ordered his immediate release. CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour -- who covered the story -- called the verdicts ""a real turning point and a milestone in justice.""  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour on the verdict » . ""It sends a message that right up the chain of command, you cannot hide,"" Amanpour said. The court said Bagosora was a key figure in drawing up plans for the genocide. A Hutu, Bagosora was convicted of ordering Hutu militia to slaughter rival Tutsis. The massacres began after a plane crash on April 6, 1994 that killed the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi. The court said the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile fired from the airport in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.  Watch what happened in the court » . Bagosora decided the military should take over and he refused to involve the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, in any discussions, the court found.

The same day the prime minister was killed, the court said, army personnel confined and killed four important opposition leaders -- including the president of the constitutional court and government ministers -- and murdered 10 Belgian peacekeepers who had been dispatched to the prime minister's residence. The court found Bagosora bore responsibility for those and other killings because he commanded those who carried out the crimes. ""Bagosora was the highest authority in the Ministry of Defense and exercised effective control of the Rwandan army and gendarmerie,"" said Presiding Judge Erik Mose. ""He's therefore responsible for the murder of the prime minister, the four opposition politicians, the 10 Belgian peacekeepers, as well as the extensive military involvement in the killing of civilians during this period."" ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow said the convicted men ""prepared, planned, ordered, directed, incited, encouraged and approved the murder of innocent civilian Tutsis."" The killings were carried out by military personnel on the orders of Rwandan authorities including Bagosora, the court said. The court found that from April to July 1994, Bagosora exercised authority over members of the Rwandan Army and their militiamen, who committed massacres throughout Rwanda with Bagosora's knowledge. ""In all the regions of the country, members of the Tutsi population who were fleeing from the massacres on their hills sought refuge in locations they thought would be safe, often on the recommendation of the local civil and military authorities,"" the indictment said. ""In many of these places, despite the promise that they would be protected by the local civil and military authorities, the refugees were attacked, abducted and massacred, often on the orders or with the complicity of those same authorities."" The indictment against Bagosora alleged he had been opposed to concessions made by his government to Tutsi rebels at 1993 peace talks in Tanzania, and had left the negotiations saying he was returning to Rwanda to ""prepare the apocalypse."" The U.N. established the tribunal in late 1994. The trial began in April 2002 and has been deliberating since June 1, 2007. During the trial, the court heard 242 witnesses -- 82 for the prosecution and 160 for the defense. The three convicted men will be held in the tribunal's custody until a state can be found to house them. The genocide's impact is still be felt today, with recent fighting in neighbouring Congo blamed on lingering tensions from the slaughter. Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo.","Bagosora guilty of masterminding genocide which left at least 800,000 dead .
