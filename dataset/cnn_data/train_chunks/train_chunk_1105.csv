"It's a terrace taunt often thrown at Manchester United fans from supporters of their cross-town rivals. The age-old accusation that most of the Old Trafford club's following do not come from the city from which they are based. 'You're the pride of Singapore,' they sing. But according to Sports Direct, it is actually City whose fans are not from the area. Figures released by the retailer show that, between the two in Manchester, 94.57 per cent of shirts sold are in the red of United compared to just 5.43 per cent in the blue of City. Manchester United took up 94.57 per cent  of the Manchester shirt sale market in 2014 . 44.71 percent of United replica shirt sales were recorded in London, Dublin was second, Manchester third . Dutch striker Robin van Persie (above) and Louis van Gaal could be the reason behind sales in Fijnaart . Just 4.72 per cent of Manchester City replica shirt sales were made in Manchester, London ranks highest . Nationwide, however, most of both club's shirts are sold in London stores. A total of 44.71 per cent of United tops are purchased in the capital compared to 27.95 per cent of City jerseys. Among shirts of London clubs sold within the city, Arsenal lead the way with 47.35 per cent of tops sold from clubs based in the capital those of the Gunners. Santi Cazorla (left) and Sergio Aguero are bound to be popular choices for shirt printing by fans . Chelsea captain John Terry and Liverpool youngster Raheem Sterling showing off their club's shirts . They are followed by Chelsea, with 35.2 per cent and Spurs with 17.45 per cent. The report, based on sales since the season began, threw up some surprising findings. Behind London and Glasgow, most City shirts are bought in Fijnaart, a village of 5,500 in the Netherlands. Places such as Dublin, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Leeds and Stockport place higher than Manchester. Arsenal may struggle to compete with Chelsea on the field but they beat them easily in London shirt sales . Arsenal  sold 61 percent of their shirts in London with Sheffield in second and Southend in third . Lagos was the second most popular place for Chelsea shirts with London storming ahead with 56.3 percent . Tottenham shirt sales were unsurprisingly dominated by the London market with Dublin sneaking in third . The findings suggest Harry Kane and his Tottenham Hotspur team mates have a big following in Dublin . As for United, Dublin beats Manchester into second place. Strangely, Sports Direct sell the most Aston Villa jerseys in Dublin, perhaps a reminder of ex-Republic of Ireland legend Paul McGrath's stint at Villa Park. Most Liverpool shirts are sold in London with Dublin and – bizarrely – Bristol shifting more than Liverpool itself. The majority of Liverpool shirts were sold in London with both Dublin and Bristol higher than their home city . And a strange-but-true 4.87 per cent of Liverpool tops are shifted in Manchester. Elsewhere, behind London most Arsenal jerseys are sold in Sheffield while Lagos is the second-most popular market for Chelsea shirts. The list was based on the company's top-eight sellers and can be viewed HERE. More Newcastle shirts were sold in London then in Newcastle, Belfast came in fourth with Australia eighth . Aston Villa (left) are the only side that did not sell the majority of their shirts in London, Dublin is top . Aston Villa sold almost a quarter of their shirts in Dublin with just 15.83 per cent sold in Birmingham .","More than a quarter of Manchester City shirt sales took place in London .

"If Sheffield United are hoping a raucous crowd will help them barge their way to Wembley on Wednesday night, then they might need to work on other plans. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that surrounds matches between the big and small of football, noise from the stands will do nothing to upset Mauricio Pochettino – it's more likely to raise a smile. Tottenham's manager loves an 'aggressive environment', a subject that dominated his thoughts ahead of the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg tie against Sheffield United. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino says the aggressive environment at Sheffield United won't faze him . The Bramall Lane faithful will be hoping to create a cauldron for Spurs on Wednesday night . Sheffield United host the Premier League side in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg . With only a 1-0 lead to show for Tottenham's first-leg efforts, and considering United's brilliant cup record under Nigel Clough, this fixture is far from over. But of all the factors that require serious thought – including the deployment of Michel Vorm in goal after his FA Cup howler at the weekend – Pochettino is not in slightest worried about the atmosphere of his first semi-final as a manager. 'I had a lot of semi-finals as a player,' the Argentine said. 'I remember the semi final in the Copa Libertadores against America de Cali in Colombia (while playing for Newell’s Old Boys in 1992). We won the final after 24 penalties, it was tough. 'I scored after seven minutes, but afterwards missed a penalty. It was crazy. It’s difficult to play in Colombia. I remember going up the tunnel to the pitch and they started to throw batteries. I remember before the game one of my team mates (Eduardo Berizzo, now manager of Celta Vigo) got hit and cut on the head. He had to get stitches from the doctor, it was very tough. 'In Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Peru or Ecuador, people are very aggressive. It’s nothing like that here. I remember every time we drove from the airport, all the glass on the bus was smashed and we fell to the floor. He says South American games are more hostile (pictured - fans cheer in a Copa Libertadores tie in 2009) Fans and the police fight during a match between Libertad and River Plate in Asuncion in 2006 . 'If I can cope with that, we can cope with anything. When I came over to France, England or Spain, people told me it was difficult to play in. But when we arrived, it was nothing. They shout when something goes wrong but nothing else. This is easy.' He added: 'My family was very worried about it, but now is happy. The people here are fantastic. Maybe it’s normal that the supporters shout at you, but in Argentina it’s impossible to have the supporters (close) in behind you because of spitting and they throw things, radios, mobiles, it’s dangerous. But in England the respect is massive.' Pochettino described this fixture as 'most important game of the season' for Tottenham, who have not won a trophy for seven years. Despite his game-costing error against Leicester on Saturday, Vorm is set to retain his place in goal.

"Everton forward Samuel Eto'o is in Italy for a medical with Sampdoria as he looks to seal his move to the Serie A club. The former Chelsea and Barcelona man flew out of England on Thursday and is set to complete his transfer by the end of Friday. Roberto Martinez initially said he wanted Eto'o to stay at Goodison Park but now seems resigned to losing the 33-year-old. Samuel Eto'o pictured on Wednesday at Manchester Piccadilly Station . Te Everton striker boarded a train to London as he gears up for switch to Serie A side Sampdoria . The 33-year-old looked a little surprised to be the subject of the photographer . Representatives of  Italian club Sampdoria came to London in an attempt to speed up the transfer due to concerns it wouldn't be completed before the February 2 deadline. And their efforts appear to have been rewarded after Sampdoria's president revealed the club were now merely sorting out the 'last few details'. 'I haven't been working in football for long and can say this is a strange working environment,' Massimo Ferrero told Sky Italia. 'People say one thing and then do another. 'We went to London and then there was a turn of events because nobody can figure out who is in charge at Everton. 'But we are getting to a breakthrough. Eto'o is very eager to come and play at Sampdoria. 'We are down to the last details. What are the chances of the move being completed? Let's be cautious and say 50 per cent.'

"Will Keane started the night with high hopes and finished it bloodied and goalless. The Old Trafford door may be shut on the young striker but he has been on the most-wanted list as far as the Championship is concerned. Wednesday manager Stuart Gray succeeded in sweet-talking Manchester United into borrowing the 22-year-old in the hope that it would herald a change in fortune at home. Will Keane of Sheffield Wednesday sports a cut above his eye during the Championship match . Keane of Sheffield Wednesday is treated for an eye injury during the Championship match . Sheffield Wednesday (4-4-2): Westwood 6; Palmer 6 Loovens 6.5, Lees 6.5, Mattock 6.5; Maguire 6 (Helan, 60 mins, 5), Baker 7, Semedo 6, Maghoma 7; Nuhiu 7.5, Keane 6.5 (May, 75 mins) Subs not used: Wildsmith, May, Lavery, Lee, Dielna . Goals: NONE . Bookings: Nuhiu . Manager: Stuart Gray . Birmingham (4-2-3-1): Randolph 7; Caddis 7, Morrison 5 (Spector, 20 mins,6 ), Robinson 7.5, Grounds 7; Davis 8, Gleeson 7; Cotterill 6, Shinnie 6 (Dyer, 70 mins, 5), Gray 6; Donaldson 5 (Thomas, 83 mins) Subs not used: Doyle, Novak, Reilly, Zigic . Goals: NONE . Bookings: Grounds, Cotterill . Manager: Gary Rowett . Referee: Trevor Kettle 7 . On this evidence, Keane, who spent spells on loan at QPR and Wigan last season, needs a match or two to re-acclimatise but still had some good touches before his departure holding a cloth to the left side of his face. Pin-pointing Wednesday’s weak spot this season does not require very much detective work. A glance at the ‘goals for’ column provides an instant clue to the team’s poor home record. Three wins at Hillsborough and seven measly goals from 14 matches is the damning statistic. Midfielder Lewis Baker has also arrived from Chelsea, to add more Premier League oomph to the South Yorkshire club. The first half turned out to be the same old story, however, with Wednesday making chances and failing to take them. Best opportunities in the first half fell to Jacques Maghoma and Atdhe Nuhui while Birmingham could have snatched the lead when Clayton Donaldson’s shot was deflected over the bar. Birmingham were always going to be hard to break down. When boss Gary Rowett replaced sacked Lee Clark the team were second from bottom of the Championship and looking at nothing more than survival. At kick-off on Tuesday night, Birmingham were 11th and at Hillsborough on the back of four wins, one draw and just one defeat in six League matches. Sheffield Wednesday's Keane goes for the ball during the Championship stalemate against Birmingham City . Both sides could have done with a win to push on in the table but shared the points in the end . The Championship match ended goalless between the sides sitting mid-table . They needed to be compact and organised with Wednesday making the early running, especially the busy Nuhiu, who helped set up Maghoma and then forced a last-ditch clearance with a shot across goal. It will take time for Nuhiu and Keane to build up an understanding but their styles suggest they should complement each other. Certainly Nuhiu’s physical presence caused most problems on Tuesday night although Birmingham showed great defensive qualities to stand firm. The pitch did not help either side. There have been two significant snow falls in South Yorkshire in recent weeks, which gave it a pallid look. Pre-match sprinklers turned the heavy surface into a sticky, gluey mess too. Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray looks on during the  Championship draw . Birmingham manager Gary Rowett could not nick a win at Hillsborough but left with a point . It would be a tad cruel to suggest the football was similar. In fact, there were some close shaves and decent moves although not many. Andrew Shinnie tried one long-range shot which went over the bar but it was Birmingham’s defenders who were far the busier. Chris Maguire shaped up for a free kick in the second half which looked like it had gone in from one angle. Home fans’ cheers were ended abruptly. And at the final whistle, the cheers were replaced by boos but even that was half-hearted.","Neither side could break the deadlock before half-time .

"High life: Stuart Broad with girlfriend Bealey Mitchell . Playing cricket for England has made him a millionaire and given him the jetsetting lifestyle of an international sports star. So critics may say it’s a bit rich that Stuart Broad has claimed those on minimum wage should ‘stay humble’. The 28-year-old, who reportedly earns a basic salary of £700,000 a year, was forced to apologise last night after facing a public backlash for his ‘hypocritical’ and ‘arrogant’ comments. Broad, currently in Australia with the England team preparing for next month’s World Cup, wrote on Twitter: ‘I’ve heard if you earn minimum wage in England you’re in the top 10% earners in the World. #stay #humble.’ The fast bowler, who was educated at Oakham School where fees for boarders are up to £30,000 a year, has since deleted the tweet. He apologised on the site, insisting the remark was meant to serve as a reminder to himself rather than an instruction to the public. But the comment had already provoked the ire of fans, sports journalists, and charities, with several accusing him of being ignorant and out of touch. Piers Morgan, who has been a social media cheerleader for ousted batsman Kevin Pietersen, wrote on Twitter: ‘Great irony of Stuart Broad’s comment is that he’s never stayed humble in his life. Makes KP [Kevin Pietersen] look like Mother Teresa in humility stakes.’ Sports journalist Owen Gibson tweeted: ‘Wonder if Stuart Broad has worked out how many humble Sky subscriptions or Ashes tickets you can afford on the minimum wage.’ A full-time employee working 40 hours a week on the UK minimum wage of £6.50 would have an annual income of around £13,500. An estimated 5.28million people earn less than the living wage, which is £7.85. In contrast, Broad is one of 16 England cricketers on a lucrative contract awarded by the England and Wales Cricket Board. The ECB does not reveal the exact pay package but the basic salary is understood to be £700,000 a year, plus four-figure sums for each appearance. In 2011, the Sunday Times reported Broad was among a clutch of professional English cricketers to hit the £1million earnings mark for the first time. Mubin Haq of anti-poverty charity Trust For London, told the Evening Standard: ‘It doesn’t take a huge amount to be in the top 10 per cent of earners in the world … But whilst a minimum wage income would be enough to live on in places like Mumbai, it’s certainly not sufficient to survive in London. The costs of living we face here are significantly higher and this is why Stuart Broad’s comments are causing offence, whether he meant it or not.’ Apologising last night, Broad wrote: ‘Clarifying my earlier tweet, I merely wanted to emphasise my amazement at just how big the world is. No offence meant and sorry if any taken. The hashtag was aimed at myself.’ But the criticism continued. Twitter user John Ingamells, 53, wrote: ‘I welcome opportunity to hear just how stupid, ignorant + out of touch some professional sportsmen appear to be.’ England cricketer Stuart Broad walks with his partner Bealey Mitchell in Perth, Australia, on Tuesday .

"Northern Premier League side FC United of Manchester will play fellow fan-owned club Benfica at their new stadium to celebrate their 10th birthday. FC United have shared grounds with various clubs since their inception, but will move in to their new stadium Broadhurst Park in May this year. In what will be a one of the first games at the new venue, the club will play a friendly against the B team of Portuguese giants and two-time European Cup winners Benfica. FC United of Manchester will play fellow fan-owned club Benfica to celebrate their 10th birthday . The Portuguese giants and two-time European champions will put out a B team to face FC United . The relationship came as a result of Benfica contacting FC officials ahead of an Under 19s match at Manchester City. The Rebels helped out with accommodation, logistics and training venues. The Portugese side triumphed - and vowed to return the favour. Andy Walsh, general manager at the club said: 'FC United of Manchester is delighted to be playing Benfica as one of the first games in our new ground at Broadhurst Park in Moston, north Manchester. 'We have had good relations with Benfica since hosting their U19s when they played Manchester City in the UEFA Youth League last season. We are proud to be playing one of the largest fan-owned clubs in the world and are looking forward to welcoming Benfica's representatives to Manchester.' Armando Jorge Carneiro, who runs the academy at Benfica, said: 'Lisbon and Manchester are cities with fans who love football and their idols. While FC United are still a young club in the history of this sport in England, it's nevertheless a great honour for SL Benfica to be present with their B team at United's stadium, Broadhurst Park. 'We hope that FC United can find, over the next years, just like Benfica almost 111 years ago, a path of victories that can launch them from being a big city club to a leading club in the world.'

"James Milner may yet remain at Manchester City, despite strong reports linking him with a move away from the club. The England international's contract at the Etihad Stadium expires at the end of the season. And after talks with City over a new deal continued to drag the 29-year-old looked set for pastures new. James Milner could yet sign a new Manchester City deal despite being linked with a move away from the club . Milner arrived at the Etihad Stadium in 2010 from Aston Villa for a reported fee of £26 million . The England midfielder's contract situation has attracted interest from clubs both at home and abroad . But Sportsmail understands both club and player have not yet given up on reaching an agreement that would see Milner extend his stay in Manchester. Negotiations are set to re-open in the near future and much will depend upon assurances over playing time. While this season Milner has made 11 first team starts in the Premier League compared with 12 in the whole of last season, he is under no illusion that the impact of injuries and and non-availability of the likes of Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri have helped his cause. In City's last two matches Milner has started in his preferred central midfield position and would welcome more opportunities at the same spot. The player is known to have options at home and in Spain and Italy. However, it is understood that signing a pre-contract deal with a foreign club is unlikely. Regardless of how talks with City pan out, Milner is thought to be keen to stay at the Etihad for the rest of the season and to honour his previous deal. The fact that he is an England international available for free means he is in a strong position as he looks for a new deal at the age of 29 but playing time, rather than cash on the table, is thought to be the main incentive. It is understood that regular first-team football will be Milner's main priority when deciding his future . Meanwhile, City declined to comment on whether they have a plane on standby to bring Ivory Coast pair Toure and £25m new boy Wilfried Bony home from the Africa Cup of Nations should their side lose to Cameroon on Wednesday night and be eliminated. The club are reluctant to discuss the prospect out of respect to the Ivory Coast. Should a defeat transpire, though, both would no doubt be welcomed into the fold by Manuel Pellegrini ahead of Saturday evening's title race showdown with league leaders Chelsea.

"Millwall manager Ian Holloway tore into referee Andrew Madley for sending off Sid Nelson in their goalless draw against Reading. Holloway's side had to play the whole second half with 10 men after Nelson was shown a red card for a late challenge on Michael Hector just before the break.

Booked: Mackie . Holloway said: 'It was a shocking red card. I watched it again and it looked far worse than it was. Sid was a split second from kicking the ball, there wasn't any malice. 'The players around didn't help with their reaction. Sid didn't deserve that.' Reading boss Steve Clarke disagreed. 'Having watched it again, the lad was reckless,' he said. 'In today's climate it's a red card. You would've got away with it in my day. Now when you make a tackle you have to be more careful. The referee was on the spot. He sees it better than us on touchline.' Holloway started five players signed this month and though they were initially playing like a side who barely knew each other managed to carve out the best chances. Stefan Maierhofer headed a long ball down to Lee Gregory who hit a first-time drive bouncing towards the bottom right corner but inches wide of the post in the first half. Then in the second debutant Jos Hooiveld, on loan from Southampton, powered a header on target from Shaun Williams' free kick and Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici was at full stretch to push it over. The first 20 minutes were starved of chances until Reading took the initiative. Substitute Alan Dunne (right) blocks a powerful shot from Reading's Hal Robson-Kanu . Reading's Nick Blackman (left) skips past Millwall defender Dan Harding during the Championship clash . Oliver Norwood sent in a corner from the right towards the near post on 22 minutes and Hal Robson-Kanu got to the ball first but his header was weak and caught by Millwall goalkeeper David Forde. Four minutes later Norwood struck an effort from all of 30 yards which bounced awkwardly in front of Forde who got his body behind the ball. On the half-hour Diego Fabbrini finally carved out a first chance for Millwall, wriggling between four Reading players inside their penalty area before digging out a cross from the left touchline, only for Federici to leap from his line to cut the ball out. A game of vague chances suddenly flared up a minute before the break, but not for the right reasons as Nelson dived in on Hector. Millwall goalkeeper David Forde comes out to claim the ball as Jamie Mackie (left) chases it down . Emotions from the sending off extended into the second half and increased the intensity as the sides traded blows. A minute after kick off, Reading's Jordan Obita struck a shot into the ground after making a late run to the back post but it was beaten out by Forde, who then kept out Daniel Williams' follow-up from distance. Then Gregory made a dart to the near post and powered a header that had Federici scrambling but fell, again, narrowly the wrong side of the post. Reading took advantage of their extra man from then on, dominating possession but failing to turn it into a goal. The point did little to help either side in their bid to avoid an end-of-season relegation fight.","Millwall's Sid Nelson shown a straight red card just before half time .

Referee: Darren Drysdale (Lincolnshire) Indeed, Bolton were plunging towards only their second defeat in any competition since October as early as the second minute when former Newcastle midfielder Conor Newton marked his full Rotherham debut by picking out Ben Pringle, who connected with an unstoppable far-post volley. It was one of three goals before the interval as Lennon was left seething on the touchline. The home team’s second midway through the half, like the first, was created down the right as Derbyshire exploited the space behind wing-back Andy Kellett to fire in a cross-shot from the edge of the box – Bolton goalkeeper Andy Lonergan could only parry and Conor Sammon tapped in his first goal of a loan spell from Derby. Bolton dominated the rest of the period after Lennon re-shaped to a 4-4-2 formation but were left fuming when referee Darren Drysdale dismissed claims for a penalty when Josh Vela was tripped. In fact, the water bottle booted by Lennon was still in motion when Derbyshire completed a stunning counter-attack by clipping onto the head of Paul Green, whose glanced finish went in off the post. Although it was all over bar the shouting, Rotherham saved their best for a dozen minutes after the re-start as Derbyshire skirted the fringe of the area before arrowing a left-footed drive beyond Lonergan.

Further tinkering by Lennon followed and Bolton played the final stages with their captain Matt Mills employed as a makeshift striker. His physicality made an impression too as Wanderers struck twice inside the final quarter hour. First, substitute Liam Trotter burst from midfield to prod past Adam Collin. Then, Mills popped up to force a close-range header past Collin to offer the travelling support brief hope of a dramatic conclusion. But Rotherham held on for their first win at the New York Stadium for more than three months to open up a five-point buffer between them and the Championship drop zone.

"Rangers chairman David Somers claims Mike Ashley's £10million loan is a 'great deal' for the club - even though the Ibrox outfit has been left with just 25 per cent of its retail business. Ashley has been allowed to tighten his grasp on the Light Blues' revenue streams after his Sports Direct firm struck a rescue package with the desperate board. In return for his loan - which will be paid in two £5million tranches - the cash-strapped Gers have given Ashley another 26 per cent of the Rangers Retail Ltd. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley and his firm Sports Direct agree £10m emergency loan deal with Rangers . Ashley - who already placed chief executive Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach onto the board - will also be allowed to nominate two more directors. The Newcastle United owner, who owns 8.92 per cent of the Light Blues, has also managed to grab a floating charge on the club as well as Murray Park, Edmiston House, Albion Car Park and the club's registered trademarks - including the Rangers crest - as collateral. But he has no claim to Ibrox after fan protests forced him to drop his demand for security on the club's historic home. Somers told Sky Sports News: 'I think it is a great deal. I'm really pleased to get some money into the club. 'It is just over 12 months since I became chairman and I had three goals. One was to make sure this great club never, ever goes into administration. Chairman David Somers (left) and chief executive Derek Llambias (centre) are fully behind Ashley's plans . 'The second one - there was no money when I joined the club so (I wanted) to get some money into the club. This deal really moves us a long way to getting some decent money into this club. 'The third goal was all about the football. We've got to get this club into the Premiership, into the Champions League and this sort of money will really help us do that.' But Somers ducked questions about how he planned to fund such a resurgence while the club continues to hand over more and more cash to Ashley. RRL is a joint venture set up by the club and Sports Direct, with Rangers owning 51 per cent and Ashley's company controlling the rest. However, Sports Direct will now control three-quarters of the business until the first part of the loan is repaid. Rangers fans were already unhappy with deal, claiming profits were unfairly skewed in Sports Direct's favour. Ashley wanted to take out a security plan on Ibrox but is unable to do so under the terms of the agreement . The club's accounts showed the company took in £7.6million last year - leaving a £1.61million dividend to be split between Rangers and Sports Direct. Rangers' share was £821,000 but it also owes Sports Direct £833,000 as the result of 'onerous leases on unprofitable stores entered into by a previous Rangers management team'. Now as part of the terms on Ashley's loan deal, the club will hand over its dividend share to repay these debts - meaning that for every pound collected by its own retail company, Rangers lost 1.6p. The terms demanded by Ashley for bailing out the club will also see shirt sponsorship cash from season 2017-18 onwards 'benefit' RRL - rather than the club itself - for the duration of the loan. The first £5million - which has no time-limit on when it must be repaid - will be used to repay the £3million Ashley handed Rangers last October and to cover Thursday's pay cheques. The second £5million chunk must be handed back to Ashley within five years. The board had a second loan offer on the table from the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - but once again put their faith in Ashley, setting them on another collision course with their own supporters. Ricki Neill of fan ownership group Rangers First said: 'We would love to understand how the arrangements with regard to Rangers Retail could work to the benefit of the PLC which owns our club. 'It seems that these arrangements are the effective price for the facility being provided. There may be no interest on the facility but we would ask for full details of the other conditions that had and have to be met in return for the facility. We hope that the directors have been very careful to ensure that their actions comply with their fiduciary duties to shareholders.' Ashley is pulling the strings for now but the balance of power could yet swing away from him in the coming weeks if Dave King succeeds in routing the board at the general meeting he has called. He also faces a hearing with the Scottish Football Association who claim he has breached duel ownership rules.","Mike Ashley and his firm Sports Direct agree £10m emergency loan deal .

"A size 30 bakery worker who piled on the pounds by snacking on the stock has lost 10 stone in as many months by giving up eating what she sells. Stacey Nugent, 24, from Toddington, Bedfordshire, lived off a diet of doughnuts and baguettes every day at her job in Greggs - starting the day with two sausage rolls and a bacon bap. Making the most of her staff discount, she feasted on the pastry goodies - and put on so much weight that she tipped the scales at 20 stone and struggled to squeeze into her clothes. Scroll down for video . Stacey Nugent, 24, piled on the pounds working at Greggs bakery reaching a whopping 20st (left), but she has since given up the greasy snacks and dropped 10st (right) in as many months . At her heaviest, Stacey was used to snide remarks about her weight from strangers in the street and being unable to find outfits on the high street to fit her frame. She signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan diet and swapped biscuits, pizza, coke and pastries for healthy soups, sandwiches and grilled chicken salads. Stacey said that she would begin to snack on unhealthy treats as soon as she walked through the door at work, and continued to do so throughout the day as it was easier than making a meal. She said: 'Every morning I would head to work and it would just be normal for me to fill up on whatever the customers were having. 'It was quicker and easier to grab a sausage roll or a scoff a jam doughnut than make a proper meal.' The 24-year-old swapped breakfast of two sausage rolls and a bacon bap for a Cambridge weight loss plan . Stacey, pictured at a size 30, said she would use her staff discount to snack on baguettes and doughnuts . Stacey said that as she continued to feast on the baked goods she noticed her clothes becoming tighter to the point where she began to struggle to find outfits to fit. 'Over the course of a couple of months it really added up and my uniform was getting tighter and tighter,' she said. BREAKFAST: Two sausage rolls, bacon bap . LUNCH: Baguette, whole pack of biscuits . DINNER: 14-inch pizza with double toppings . SNACKS: 2L coke, half a pack of biscuits . BREAKFAST: Cambridge Weight Plan shake . LUNCH: Healthy soup or sandwich at work. DINNER: Grilled chicken salad . SNACKS: Nothing . 'The only place I could find clothes big enough was in supermarkets - I lived my whole life around food.' Stacey said that even as she realised she was gaining weight she still found it hard to resist the convenience of the fast food. Stacey, pictured at her heaviest, weighing 20 stone, she knew she had to change her ways after people began to point and stare in the street . Stacey said since reaching a slender size 10 she no longer has any problems finding clothes . 'In the evenings I'd bring home snacks because I was so tired from being on my feet all day I couldn't bring myself to cook.' It wasn't until she became so big that strangers began to point out her size that Stacey finally realised that something had to be done. 'It really hit home when people were staring and pointing in the street - I couldn't believe I had become such a spectacle,' she said. 'It was so embarrassing I knew I had to do something.' Fed up of always being the fat friend, Stacey decided to fight the flab by giving up snacking at work completely and taking on a radical diet. The 24-year-old says she could never imagine going back to her old eating habits . Instead of eating whatever she served to customers, Stacey started the Cambridge Weight Plan and replaced her giant greasy portions with soups and healthy salads. In 10 months she'd managed to shed a whopping 10st - half her body weight. Stacey is thrilled with her new slender figure and says she has no trouble finding new outfits to wear. 'Now I can go into a shop and buy any clothes that I want and I love trying out all the tasty healthy alternatives at work, as well as cooking at home. 'And I'm very disciplined at work. My colleagues have been really supportive.' Stacey added that she can't ever imagine returning to her old eating habits. 'Now I can't believe I ever thought that eating pastries for every meal was a good idea!

"Last year it was the advert that warmed the hearts of football fans across the country. The uplifting Budweiser commercial portraying the lost dog and its Clydesdale horse friend was played during the Super Bowl - as it has done for nearly three decades. Now the beer company are doing the same again - and teasers from the newest installment give the impression it could be a tearjerker . Concern: Teasers for the new Super Bowl advert released by Budweiser show a dog's owner putting up 'Lost Dog' signs on the lampost .

"This distressing last photograph of a dying mother of four crawling on a hospital floor in agony shocked the nation. Margaret Lamberty’s family complained she was ignored by medics and left to die in a side ward. Despite their pleas for an apology, the Royal Stoke University Hospital refused to admit any wrongdoing in the run-up to the 45-year-old’s death. Almost a year on, however, a damning report has confirmed that the family’s complaints were justified – and the hospital has been forced to say sorry. Shocking: Margaret Lamberty, who was pictured crawling on a hospital floor in agony, was overlooked by medics, a report has revealed . Mrs Lamberty, pictured with her eldest daughter Laura in 2012, died after doctors missed a treatable blood clot in her stomach . The independent report revealed that Mrs Lamberty was indeed repeatedly overlooked by medics who were ‘too busy’ to treat her. It found she died as a result of a treatable blood clot in her bowel that was missed due to ‘substandard management’, including a lack of record-taking. The results are vindication for Mrs Lamberty’s family who, following her death on April 30 last year, said: ‘Mum was failed by the doctors and the nurses. We are determined to get justice.’ Mrs Lamberty, who was a divorced grandmother of eight, was taken to casualty by her family with chronic stomach pain on April 27 last year. She was left for two hours with her pain registering a maximum score on a medical scale until she was finally given drugs to ease her distress, the report said. The Royal Stoke University Hospital refused to admit any wrongdoing in the run-up to Mrs Lamberty's death, but have now apologised . Mrs Lamberty is said to have crawled out to reception to plead for painkillers after staff told her daughter she could only have paracetamol . Staff at the hospital failed to check whether the medication was effective in the days up to her death, despite her pleas for a re-examination. At around 6pm, after Mrs Lamberty had been at the hospital for nine hours, her eldest daughter, Laura, 29, pressed an emergency buzzer as her mother screamed in pain. Vindicated: Mrs Lamberty's daughter Laura said the hospital made her family appear as if they were 'liars' She says she waited 30 minutes for assistance, but no one came to help, so she had to go to the reception desk to ask for more painkillers. Staff told her they couldn’t give her anything other than paracetamol. In desperation, her mother is alleged to have crawled on her hands and knees down the corridor to beg them for pain relief. Mrs Lamberty’s family told staff of her history of blood clots but medics failed to carry out a scan that would have detected the clot until it was too late, stated the report drawn up by a senior nurse and doctor. And when nurses sought to have her condition reassessed, she was denied an examination by senior doctors. Instead, Mrs Lamberty was left in a side ward. The report found her intestinal condition was ‘notoriously difficult to diagnose’. The stay-at-home mother left behind three other children: Sarah Lamberty, 27, Tony Hills, 19, and 14-year-old Gemma Riseley. Mark Hackett, the hospital’s chief executive, has issued an ‘unreserved apology’ and promised to learn from the mistakes. The hospital trust said the care given was unacceptable. But speaking on behalf of her family, mother-of-five Laura, from Chell Heath in Staffordshire, said: ‘They have made us out to be liars but these reports back up everything we say. ‘I don’t want to talk to the hospital again and will take these reports straight to our solicitor.’ The case has been referred to the General Medical Council. Mrs Lamberty’s death was the latest scandal at the hospital, built just three years ago at a cost of £400million. Great-grandmother Lillian Baddeley, 81, died eight months after catching four superbugs. And two premature babies died after contracting a bug because staff did not wash their hands.","Margaret Lamberty, 45, was pictured crawling on a hospital floor in agony .

"The British 'stiff upper lip' and a fear of wasting a doctor's time mean nearly half of the over-50s ignore symptoms of cancer (file picture) The British 'stiff upper lip' and a fear of wasting a doctor's time mean nearly half of the over-50s ignore symptoms of cancer. Further reasons for not seeking help were fearing the worst, dismissing warning signs and lacking confidence in the country's healthcare system. The Cancer Research UK study was published ahead of an NHS campaign warning people to tell their doctor about trivial complaints – such as a persistent cough or heart burn – that could indicate cancer. Other tell-tale signs include an unexplained lump, a persistent change in bowel or bladder habits, unexplained weight loss, constant difficulty swallowing and a change in the appearance of a mole. The study, of more than 1,700 people aged 50 and over, looked at how those who experience possible cancer symptoms decide whether or not to seek medical help. Many dismissed their symptoms as 'normal for them' while others reported them to their GP only in passing, or preferred to go to A&E. Cancer Research UK said many symptoms may not be a cause of cancer but, if they are, early diagnosis increases survival chances. The survey found that more than 900 people reported having at least one symptom of cancer in the previous three months. One woman explained away her persistent abdominal pain by saying: 'At times I thought it was bad...but then it kind of fades away and it doesn't seem worth pursuing.' A man with a change in bladder habits said: 'You've just got to get on with it. And if you go to the doctor too much, it's seen as a sign of weakness or that you are not strong enough to manage things on your own.' The study, of more than 1,700 people aged 50 and over, looked at how those who experience possible cancer symptoms decide whether or not to seek medical help (file picture) Katriina Whitaker, a senior cancer research fellow at University College London, said: 'Many of the people we interviewed had red flag symptoms but felt that these were trivial and didn't need medical attention, particularly if they were painless or intermittent. 'Others felt that they shouldn't make a fuss or waste valuable NHS resources. The stiff-upper-lip stoicism of some who decided not to go to their doctor was alarming because they put up with often debilitating symptoms. 'Some people made the decision to get symptoms checked out after seeing a cancer awareness campaign or being encouraged to do so by family or friends – this seemed to almost legitimise their symptoms as important.' The study was published in the British Journal of General Practice.","British 'stiff upper lip' means nearly half over 50s ignore cancer symptoms .

"Tragic: Ben Cowburn, 18,was found dead in December 2010 . A TV comedian ‘groomed’ a teenage boy for sex just months before the troubled youth killed himself, an inquest has heard. The gay comic, referred to only as ‘Mr X’ at the hearing, is said to have showered tragic Ben Cowburn with gifts then took him to drink and drug-fuelled parties. Within weeks the fashion student felt ‘dirty and used’ as he had become immersed in ‘a hedonistic lifestyle which he found distasteful’. At one party he was persuaded to strip in front of a group of men who began to fondle him until one guest intervened and told them to stop. After another late night of drink and drugs, the TV star crept into bed with Ben for sex. In a statement to the inquest, his twin sister Sophia said: ‘We had concerns about him being groomed by Mr X.’ Ben was due to work as the comedian’s stylist but they fell out and the teenager made several apparent suicide attempts and was admitted to a mental health hospital. There he took a serious drug overdose, and four days later he was found dead, a plastic bag at his side. In the weeks before he took his life, the 18-year-old suggested to family, friends and doctors that the famous comedian had taken advantage of him. He told one nurse: ‘I felt dirty, used, belittled and humiliated.’ After he was found dead in his  hospital room, local police officers alerted Scotland Yard to ‘suggestions that Benjamin may have been the victim of a serious sexual assault’. But police never questioned the celebrity and he has not given evidence at Ben’s inquest, where the coroner agreed his identity should be protected. The claims emerged after the ongoing inquest heard from an independent expert that Ben did not receive the required standard of care at the hospital, and that staff had been kept in the dark about the seriousness of his condition. However, the jury has also heard evidence from several witnesses that Ben’s troubles worsened after he met the older man, soon after moving to London from Cornwall. He had been a star pupil at the Fashion Retail Academy founded by billionaire tycoon Sir Philip Green, the inquest in Truro heard last week. In his first year he was chosen to attend a lunch with Sir Philip, and in April 2010 he put a question to David Cameron when he visited the London college during the General Election campaign. Ben’s parents Sharon and Steve Cowburn, who run a chain of nursery schools in Cornwall, believed  he had settled in well after starting the course in September 2009. ‘It was around this time I became aware that Ben had met a celebrity in a pub when he was out with friends,’ his mother told the inquest jury. Star student: Ben Cowburn, circled bottom right, asked David Cameron a question during a 2010 election campaign visit to his college . ‘He had asked Ben to do some styling work for him. Steve and I were quite cautious about it and were warning Ben. He told me that this man already had a stylist and that he couldn’t pay Ben but that he would buy him presents.’ She said they had discovered Ben’s new friend had featured in a gay magazine. ‘He told me that the celebrity had got a job for Ben to be his stylist at the Edinburgh Festival.’ His twin sister Sophia told how Ben had tried a cocktail of drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy. He also spoke of the many clothes Mr X had bought him, as well as a designer Burberry bag. Ben was said to have told his sister: ‘I’m milking him for a change instead of him milking me.’ Nurse David Taylor said Ben had ‘had a sexual relationship with a man who was on the television. He thought he had been groomed. He felt embarrassed, ashamed and used but never said he was raped or abused. It was consensual.’ But the teenager reportedly said: ‘He took advantage of me. He bought me nice things, spent money on me, took me to places –  private parties.’ According to police, Ben told nurse Joseph Wilson-May that the comedian had ‘made a move on  him’ in the back of a cab but the teenager ‘shrugged it off’. DC David Gadsby from the Metropolitan Police told the inquest: ‘One evening Ben went to a party at this man’s house. There was a lot of drugs and alcohol there. ‘At about 4am, Ben wanted to leave but a cab was too expensive. The man offered a room and Ben went to sleep. When he woke up this man was lying in bed next to him.’ He performed a sex act on the man – but Ben was said to have claimed to the nurse that he ‘wasn’t gay but felt pressured into doing things’. Bereaved: Sharon and Steve Cowburn, Ben's parents, are pictured arriving at the inquest a week ago . DC Gadsby said Ben had told the nurse about a private party at a separate address. ‘At some point during this party a group of men got Ben to strip and began playing with him. Another guest told them to stop.’ Another nurse told how Ben claimed to have been raped. But once he had used the word he never returned to the subject. He had also asked his elder half-sister Laura: ‘What do you think he is doing? Grooming me?’ The policeman told the inquest: ‘Laura said that Ben led her to believe he had been raped.’ But police decided there was ‘no conclusive evidence’ that Ben was physically forced into sex and so had no grounds for questioning Mr X. The star’s identity has been protected under an informal agreement between Cornwall Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon and barristers representing Ben’s family and the NHS. They agreed that because the comedian had never been questioned, arrested or cautioned it was unfair to name him. The Mail on Sunday is aware of his identity. Jurors were shown Facebook messages between the student and Mr X but they appeared to be friendly. Ben had written to him in June: ‘Pleeeeaaaaze come and meet me xxxxx.’ When Ben returned to the family home in Truro in summer 2010 after completing his first year at college, he revealed that his planned trip to Edinburgh with the celebrity had been cancelled, but gave no reasons. His mother then noticed a ‘real change’ in Ben’s behaviour with ‘hard partying, late nights and outbursts of anger’. Within days of returning to college after the summer, Ben was found by police threatening to jump from a railway bridge. He was talked down, taken to a mental health hospital for assessment and later driven back to his family. During the autumn of 2010 his mental state rapidly deteriorated. He made a series of suicide attempts, threatening to jump from a multi-storey car park, lying across a railway track and trying to throw himself in front of cars on the A30. In October he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act to Longreach Hospital near Redruth, later staying as an informal patient. Ben, by then 18, began to hint about troubling sexual experiences in  London, and tried further attempts at self-harm and suicide. He was found dead in his bedroom on December 20, with a plastic bag close by. Dr Alin Mascas, a psychiatrist at Longreach, said: ‘We considered that he had been exposed to an event of traumatic intensity, possibly sexual assault in London. He was ashamed and disgusted with himself.’ After Ben’s death, his family set up a charity called the Invictus Trust to help other local teenagers with mental health problems.

"Up to 30 babies and mothers died at a scandal-hit hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors, a damning report is expected to reveal. The independent inquiry into baby deaths within University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust will show that the scale of the scandal was much worse than previously feared. It had been thought that 16 babies and two mothers had died as a result of shambolic care over nearly ten years at a maternity ward within Furness General Hospital in Cumbria. Tragic: Concerns were first raised in September 2008 when Joshua Titcombe, who was nine days old, died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics . But after highlighting concerns in around 50 cases, investigators are expected to conclude that neglect contributed to even more deaths. Health officials have tried to cover up their failure to properly investigate poor patient care on the unit. Despite multiple warnings about failings between 2001 and 2012, the Care Quality Commission gave the hospital a clean bill of health in 2010. The failure to strike off any nurse, doctor or midwife working at the hospital has enraged victims’ families. Concerns were first raised in September 2008 when Joshua Titcombe, who was nine days old, died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics. His father James said it was ‘appalling’ that nobody has been disciplined for the failings that led to the deaths and described the accountability process as ‘ridiculously slow’. 'Appalling': Hoa and James Titcombe, parents of Joshua. James said it was ‘appalling’ that nobody has been disciplined for the failings that led to the deaths of up to 30 babies and mothers . Mr Titcombe said: ‘It’s been six years since Joshua died and we have should been finding out about [the care failings] at the time. It’s a sign of how closed and secretive the NHS was. ‘We were faced with obstacle after obstacle which is an indictment of how the NHS was run at the time. ‘What happened to protecting mothers and babies? The timescale is a disgrace.’ He said there was no reason why culpable nurse and doctors could not have been held to account before the report was published. A number of midwives from the hospital are due to face the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) later this year in relation to deaths at the hospital. Mr Titcombe added: ‘For Joshua to have died in 2008 and the NMC’s processes to still be ongoing is absolutely appalling. How can that be protecting mothers and babies? ‘There has been a real failure in the way the professional regulators have worked.’ The independent inquiry into the trust, expected to be published next month, was finally ordered by ministers due to mounting concerns over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies. Mr Titcombe added: ‘For Joshua to have died in 2008 and the NMC’s processes to still be ongoing is absolutely appalling. How can that be protecting mothers and babies? While officials continued to cover up the extent of the hospital’s problems, a police investigation was eventually launched after repeated complaints from victims’ families. The report is expected to lay some of the blame on the ‘dysfunctional’ relationship between midwives and doctors on the ward, according to the Sunday Times. The widespread ‘loss’ of medical records that contained vital medical information, such as in the case of Joshua Titcombe, will also be highlighted. An internal review published in March 2010 highlighted concerns about the maternity unit including the relations between staff. The CQC, however, failed to read the report and passed the hospital as ‘safe’ a year later. When a CQC official produced a dossier showing the inspection was flawed, bosses told him to destroy it to protect the commission’s reputation. The extent to which officals have tried to deflect attention from the failing hospital has been branded ‘rotten’ by ministers and likened to the Mid-Staffordshire Trust cover-up. The CQC and the parliamentary and health service ombudsman are also thought to be in line for criticism in Dr Bill Kirkup’s report. It will raise more questions about how medical staff and those tasked with inspecting the quality of care provided are held to account. Up to 30 babies and mothers died at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria because of failings by midwives and doctors, a damning report is expected to reveal . A string of senior staff at the trust have ‘stepped down’ from their jobs with lucrative pay packets - but nobody has been sacked. Others linked to the alleged cover-up have also left their roles, with families expected to continue with legal action against the trust following the report’s publication. Former chief executive of the Morecambe Bay Trust, Tony Halsall, left in March with a £225,000 pay-off and has since moved to the private sector. Jill Finney, former deputy chief executive of the CQC, was awarded £60,000 for distress after she was accused covering up a CQC report. She always denied the allegation. The Morecombe Bay Trust however has refused to say whether it has taken any action against any staff members or whether the nurses are still employed.","Concerns first raised in 2008 when Joshua Titcombe died of infection .

"Hosts Australia rode two early strikes to a 2-0 victory over United Arab Emirates that sent them into the Asian Cup final for a second successive tournament at a rain-soaked Newcastle Stadium on Tuesday. The Socceroos, who lost to Japan in the final four years ago, will take on another East Asian power in South Korea on Saturday in Sydney looking to seal a first continental title at their third attempt. Defenders led the way for the goal-happy tournament hosts with Trent Sainsbury heading them in front after three minutes and Jason Davidson doubling the lead 11 minutes later. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Asian Cup highlights: Australia 2-0 UAE . West Brom Jason Davidson wheels away in celebration after doubling Australia's lead against UAE . Tim Cahill, who scored a stunning overhead kick in Australia's previous match, celebrates a goal .

Australia: Ryan; Franjic, Davidson, Spiranovic, Sainsbury; Jedinak; Milligan, Luongo, Leckie, Kruse; Cahill . Goals: Sainsbury 3, Davidson 14 . United Arab Emirates: Naser; Abbas, Esmaeel, Sanqour, Salem, Ahmed Gharib; A Abdulrahman, M Abdulrahman, O Abdulrahman; Khalil, Mabkhout . Referee: Ravshan Irmatov . Attendance: 21,079 . The UAE stunned champions Japan in a penalty shootout to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1996 but another upset never looked on the cards after Australia's early salvo. Attacking midfielder Omar Abdulrahman did nothing to detract from his burgeoning reputation with some delightful touches and striker Ahmed Khalil hit the woodwork in the first half but they were unable to create enough clear-cut chances. The wet pitch probably did not help but Australia, with Matthew Spiranovic restored to the back four after suspension, also defended well enough to contain Abdulrahman and his team mates. Sainsbury heads in to put Australia ahead in their Asian Cup semi-final after just three minutes . United Arab Emirates goalkeeper Majed Naser looks on after conceding in a rainy Newcastle on Tuesday . Sainsbury (pictured wearing 20) smiles after setting Australia on their way to victory in the Asian Cup . It was at the other end of the pitch that the Socceroos made the most important early impression to the delight of the majority of the crowd of 21,079. Winger Robbie Kruse had his cross blocked after a burst down the right in the opening couple of minutes but when the corner came swinging into the box, Sainsbury rose unchallenged to head the ball into the net off the turf. The UAE had their best chance in the 10th minute when Abdelaziz Sanqour broke down the right flank and crossed for striker Khalil to hit the ball first time against the base of the post. UAE's defence are helpless to stop Davidson's header doubling Australia's lead early in the match . Davidson, one arm aloft, runs off in celebration to the delight of the home fans in Newcastle, Australia . Mark Milligan (left) runs after Davidson after he scored to put Australia 2-0 up against UAE . Australia were straight back on the attack, though, and after another surge down the right the ball was heading towards Tim Cahill in front of goal. Cahill was dragged back as he was attempting a shot and Mathew Leckie then had an effort blocked but the ball fell to Davidson, who calmly drilled it low and hard into the goal. The Australians were in no mood to sit back and protect their lead but the UAE kept their shape and gradually worked their way back into the contest. Khalil let fly with a long-range effort that flew past Mat Ryan and wide of the post in the 51st minute and Abdulrahman continued to probe for weaknesses in the Australian defence.

Massimo Luongo, Australia's find of the tournament, had another impressive game in midfield and his curling effort came close to the target after 72 minutes. The Socceroos continued to press forward and Leckie forced a save out of Majed Naser in the 75th minute, although the referee failed to see it and awarded a goal kick. The UAE probably deserved a goal but Ali Ahmed Mabkhout had his shot smothered by Sainsbury in the dying minutes to leave his tally for the tournament at four.","Australia faced United Arab Emirates in the Asian Cup semi-final .

"Some of Britain's most notorious criminals including serial killer Rose West and Soham murderer Ian Huntley have the keys to their own cells – meaning they can roam virtually at will. A third of all prisoners in the UK, including those convicted of murder, rape and terrorist offences, have been handed privacy locks under a scheme to protect their 'decency'. Conservative MP Philip Davies, branded the country's prison system a 'joke' after he found that 28,767 out of 84,865 offenders have keys in a series of Freedom of Information requests. Serial killer Rose West (left) and Soham murderer Ian Huntley (right) have the keys to their own cells – meaning they can roam virtually at will . 'I think that many people will find these figures staggering, and not know whether to laugh or cry,' the Shipley MP told the Sunday Express. 'However it perfectly illustrates and sums up what a joke the prison system is in the UK and why so many people have no confidence in it at all.' Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, home to child sex offender Ian Watkins and Huntley, who murdered 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, is one of 70 prisons which operates the scheme. Lostprophets singer Watkins was recently moved to the high-security prison after being sentenced to 35 years for a string of child sex offences including the attempted rape of a baby. The Ministry of Justice confirmed that every prisoner on the site has their own cell key, other than those who have been segregated or are undergoing treatment on the hospital wing. Suffolk strangler Steve Wright, who murdered five prostitutes, and Tanvir Hussain, who plotted to blow up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs are also inmates at the prison. Long Lartin, in Worcestershire,  is one of 70 prisons which operates the scheme to protect inmates' privacy . All the inmates at female Low Newton prison, in Durham, where West is detained, have the privacy keys. She was convicted in 1995 for a killing spree with husband Fred, that saw 10 young women murdered. The couple subjected their victims to horrific sexual violence before they were killed, dismembering and burying the bodies beneath their house in Gloucester. Gartree prison, in Leicestershire, which is home to Europe's largest population of lifers, also has their own privacy keys. They were designed to enable prisoners to protect their belongings when leaving their cells and use the  toilet and washing facilities in private. Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins (left) was recently moved to a prison which operates the scheme and is also the home of Suffolk strangler Steve Wright (right) Inmates are only allowed to use the keys at set times and the guards hold security keys which can override all other locks. According to the MoJ privacy locks have been in use since 1991 and are now fitted as standard. A spokeswoman said: 'Governors have the authority to operate schemes in which prisoners may hold a 'privacy key' to their allocated cells as part of their local regime. 'This gives a prisoner the ability to open and close their own cell during a designated set period when the door would otherwise have been open. 'It does not allow them to open other cells or doors/gates to other parts of the prison. 'At all other times the cell doors can only be opened by prison staff who hold security keys which operate a separate cell door lock. 'These locks override the privacy locks at all other times, and ensure that staff have complete control over all cell doors. 'The retention in possession of a privacy lock key by a prisoner does not impact on the overall security of the prison and presents a minimal risk. 'All privacy lock schemes are implemented and managed at a local level and keys are only issued to prisoners whose suitability has been assessed.' 'The responsibility of locking their own cells can also help to prepare prisoners for release. 'The availability of privacy keys to appropriately selected prisoners does not represent a risk to the public and is entirely different from security keys which are used for the perimeter of the prison and controlling internal access and movement.'","A third of all prisoners in the UK have been handed privacy locks .

"England football captain Kelly Smith says she would have 'slapped' the on-court interviewer who asked Eugenie Bouchard to twirl after her win in the Australian Open last week. Serena Williams and Canada's Bouchard were asked to spin around to show off their outfits during on-court interviews in Melbourne, prompting an angry response on social media and accusations of sexism levelled at Tennis Australia commentator Ian Cohen, who made the request. Smith described the request as 'arrogance or stupidity' and told Sportsmail: 'If I was (asked by an interviewer to twirl) I would probably have slapped him around the face or something. It was an insult to women's sport.' Eugeie Bouchard was asked to twirl by interviewer Ian Cohen and she looked embarrassed at the request . England women's captain Kelly Smith as called the request 'an insult to women's sport' The Canadian, practicing here for her quarter-final match, has played down the sexism row . Smith was speaking at the launch of the Women's Sport Trust's £BeaGamechanger Awards, which recognise the individuals and organisations doing the most to progress women's sport - and consign such outdated requests to the past. Smith added: 'It shows that there still is that ignorance when it comes to women's sport and that transfers to kids today - people think it is still okay to say things like that. 'The more we raise the profile of women's sport through the Women's Sport Trust and awards such as these, the bigger the chance of knocking that behaviour and ignorance out of sport and society in general.' Bouchard did oblige, later commenting that it was 'unexpected' that an 'old guy' asked her to twirl on-court . Bouchard laughed as she twirled for the interviewer to show off her outfit after her straight-sets victory . The interviewer continued to speak to Bouchard after she twirled for him after her second round match . Serena Williams (1) vs Dominika Cibulkova (11) Madison Keys vs Venus Williams (18) Ekaterina Makarova (10) vs Simona Halep (3) Eugenie Bouchard (7) VS Maria Sharapova (2) The 38-year-old Smith will lead England to the World Cup in Canada in June admitting the rising profile of the women's game will heap the squad with the extra pressure of expectation. But she is relishing the belated interest after recalling a different story even as recently as the last World Cup in 2011 when England exited on penalties at the quarter-final stage. Smith said: 'The women's game is reaching new levels in this country and being a role model is now part of the package - I never had a female sporting role model growing up so I am happy to help. 'There is money and television coming into the game now on a level we did not have four years ago. The general public have been involved in the build-up and all it needs now is for the team to perform and the sport will explode again.' Arsenal women's star Smith (right) is pleased to be a role model for young children . Smith has the biggest ambitions for the England squad in Canada and believes that having soared unbeaten through their qualification they are justified in believing they are capable of competing with the traditional powerhouses of the women's game. 'We have seen a real shift in the players' mentality over the last few years - you have to have that belief both individually and collectively that you can go out and do it,' added Smith. 'It is something we have probably lacked in the past but we have got it now and with the attitude we have instilled in the team we know we are capable of taking on and beating anyone in the world.' The Canadian wore a typically colourful outfit while practicing in Melbourne on Monday . Bouchard signs autographs after completing her fourth round victory set up a clash with Maria Sharapova . Billie Jean King, who won the tournament in 1968, had previously accused Cohen of being 'truly sexists' and tweeted: 'The Australian Open interviewer asking the women to 'twirl' on court is out of line. 'This is truly sexist. If you ask the women, you have to ask the guys to twirl as well.' The 12-time Grand Slam singles winner, now 71, added: 'Let's focus on competition and accomplishments of both genders and not our looks.' Bouchard looked slightly bemused by the request, which followed her straight-sets win over Kiki Bertens, admitting in her post-match press conference the question had taken her by surprise. 'It was very unexpected. I mean, yeah, I don't know. An old guy asking you to twirl, it was funny,' said the seventh seed. Serena Williams refused to discuss suggestions of sexism, but suggested that male players wouldn't have been asked the same question by the interviewer .

"They could almost be mistaken for innocent trinkets, but these small metal stamps were used to facilitate one of history's most appalling crimes. The interchangeable pieces were inserted into a special metal stamps and used by Nazi SS guards to tattoo prisoners' ID numbers at the Auschwitz death camp. But knowledge of their use could easily have been lost to time, as the Nazis, constantly looking to streamline the business of murder, soon replaced them with a quicker and more efficient system. These metal stamps were used to  tattoo prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the early days of the holocaust before the Nazis replaced them with a more efficient system . The main gate of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz where the devices were used to stamp tattoos onto prisoners' chests from 1941 before being replaced by a simpler system . The loathsome devices are set to go . on display at the Auschwitz Museum in Oswiecim, Poland, where they will . form part of a new collection. When . prisoners first began to arrive at Auschwitz in occupied Poland in 1940 . they were each issued with an identification number. At first these numbers were stamped onto pieces of cloth which the prisoners were ordered to sew onto their clothing. Trinkets of hate: The interchangeable pieces, which were inserted into metal stamps, were originally favoured by SS guards as they allowed the tattoo to be applied in a single stroke . The evil-looking devices were only used for a short period at Auschwitz as they were found to be inefficient and replaced with a simpler system which used a single needle attached to a pen holder . The loathsome devices are set to go on display at the Auschwitz Museum in Oswiecim, Poland, where they will form part of a new collection . But prisoners would often replace their old worn-out clothes with those of others who had died causing an unacceptable amount of confusion among the German prison guards. So . the Nazis decided to start using tattoos instead. The stamps were . originally thought to be the fastest method as they allowed the number . to be applied in a single stroke. At first, the tattoos were applied to . their left breast. The stamp perforated the . skin, and ink was rubbed into the wounds producing a tattoo. Survivor: Bessie Mittelman, 82, helps show the number tattooed on the chest of her husband Manny Mittelman, 88. He is one of the few Auschwitz survivors to have a chest tattoo. After the stamp system was replaced prisoners were tattooed on their arms . Most of the prisoners to receive tattoos at Auschwitz had them placed on their arms using a single needle attached to a pen holder . The first to be tattooed in this fashion were Soviet prisoners of war who began arriving and dying by their thousands from 1941. The stamp system soon proved unnecessarily complex and the Nazis replaced it with a simple needle attached to a penholder which was used to apply the tattoo to the forearm. It is extremely rare now for find holocaust survivors who have their ID number tattoo on their chest as most of those interned in the early days of the camp's existence did not make it to the end of the war. Contrary to popular belief, Auschwitz, which consisted of Auschwitz I (Main Camp), Auschwitz II (Auschwitz-Birkenau), and Auschwitz III (Monowitz and the subcamps) was the only concentration camp where tattoos were used to identify prisoners. Some of the 600 children, who survived the Auschwitz, show their tattooed identification numbers. Some 7,000 prisoners, were alive when the camp was liberated . SS officers (L-R) Dr Josef Mengele, Rudolf Hoess, (former Commandant of Auschwitz), Josef Kramer (Commandant of Birkenau) are pictured at the Auschwitz in occupied Poland . Ominously, those who did receive a tattoo on arrival at Auschwitz could actually be considered lucky, for those who did not were deemed unfit for work and sent off for immediate execution. In the spring of 1943, authorities adopted the practice of tattooing almost all previously registered and newly arrived prisoners, including females. The only exceptions were German prisoners who were held in a separate compound. Perhaps the most notorious of all the Nazi concentration camps, 1.1million Jews were killed at Auschwitz. The camp consisted of three main parts: Auschwitz I (the base camp) Auschwitz II - Birkenau (the extermination camp) and Auschwitz III - Monowitz (the labour camp). The train tracks at Auschwitz-Birkenau where an estimated 1.3million, mostly Jewish prisoners were executed . During the war the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the infamous SS - 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. It was run by camp commandant Rudolf Höss who was tried and hanged in 1947 for his part in the extermination. The camp was liberated by the Red Army on January 27 1945, the day was subsequently declared International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Following its liberation the camp has become a symbol of the holocaust and has operated as a museum since 1947.","The interchangeable pieces were inserted into a special metal stamp .

"A 15-year-old schoolboy has created one of the world's top apps in just a couple of hours - while he was bored in a class. Ben Pasternak, from Sydney’s east, created the app 'Impossible Rush' while he was bored in a Year 9 science class, with the help of an American teenager he met through Facebook. The app is quickly climbing the charts in the US, Sweden and Australia, and has been downloaded more than 300,000 in the six weeks since it launched. ‘Oh my god, we’re number three!’ Ben said during his interview with Daily Mail Australia. ‘Sorry, I just refreshed and we’ve climbed up third on the App Store. We were number five. ‘We’re ahead of Instagram, Pinterest ,Spotify, Shazam: all the big players! ‘The only apps ahead of us are Facebook and Facebook messenger - they’re next!’ quips the ambitious teen. Scroll down for video . Ben Pasternak, from Sydney’s east, created the app ‘Impossible Rush’ while he was bored in a Year 9 Science class, with the help of an American teenager whom he met through Facebook. The app was created by the two teenagers in August, and in six weeks has climbed to number three on the Aussie App Store . Ben is an incredibly bright student at Reddam House School in Woollahra, but confesses: ‘I’m currently not going too good at school, but I believe my app development career is more important right now.’ In August, Ben was distracted during class when he contacted a friend, 15-year old Chicago schoolboy Austin Valleskey, who he met through Facebook group ‘High School Hackers.’ ‘I was a little bored so I opened by laptop and I messaged Austin in America. ‘I asked him, “Do you want to quickly just make a little game or something?” ‘He said “yeah of course’ and the game came out of nowhere, I just designed it in Photoshop.”’ Ben sent his version to Austin and an hour later, Austin sent him the prototype, which had been designed using xcode, a program used to design iPhone apps. ‘It was really fun so we decided to launch it.’ Ben is excited about his new project, app 'One' which allows users to use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on the one sleek app . ‘I realised I was onto something after seeing people playing our trial app and the fact that we have the best marketing an app could have.’ The marketing came when they contacted New York-based social media marketer Carlos Fajardo, who they sold the app to for $200. ‘I had no problem giving Carlos the app due to the fact I made it for fun and had no intentions to launch it,' said Ben. ‘Marketing is everything, most developers don’t even consider the concept of marketing their work.’ The entrepreneur is now on the brink of launching his new app, ‘One’ which will allow users to combine Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It has taken months of work. ‘Impossible Rush was the first game I have made. It doesn’t represent my work - just a bit of fun. '‘One’ is my primary focus. I am extremely passionate about the concept and the problem I am solving.' Ben tells Daily Mail Australia: '‘I love what I do so it isn’t stressful. What is stressful is juggling it with school.' Although Ben is entertaining designing his own platforms and hardware, he is 100 per cent committed to his new business model. ‘I will not stop app development til ‘One’ is number one on the App Store. ’Apps are awesome. They might not last in 10 years but the concept of downloading a developer’s project without having to buy it physically will remain for a while.’ It all started for Ben when he was eight, he started to play the Disney online children’s game, Club Penguin. ‘With Club Penguin, I tried to push boundaries. I’d find hacks to get more coins for the game,’ Ben tells Daily Mail Australia. As ‘Impossible Rush’ has gained popularity, Ben has been inundated with exciting new offers. ‘I’ve had multiple job offers and been asked to motivate students studying i0S development at universities,' said Ben. ‘‘I was offered a few part time and a few full-time jobs but I’m currently not really planning on getting a job, I’m focussing on my own project. Ben has quickly gained international attention for his incredible innovations at such a young age . ‘If I spoke at the universities I’d tell them: “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do.” ‘The success has been extremely encouraging. People once doubted me based purely on statistics.’ Ben is also committed to finishing school and going to university. The app is taking up a lot of Ben’s time – but his passion for the project means he has been more than willing to devote months of his life to it. ‘I love what I do so it isn’t stressful. What is stressful is juggling it with school. ‘In my free time I work on my apps, nothing else. 'Even when I’m walking and talking with friends, I’m always thinking about the app in the back of the head. Ben says that although he spends every possible moment on his app, he makes time to have fun like any other Aussie boy. ‘Most people in this field are considered nerds but for me, I’m still like a normal teenager - I go see a movie, go to the beach, food, those kinds of things . According to Ben, he is in quite a bit of trouble with his school for putting his app first and schoolwork second! ‘I ignore projects and work on my app. A lot of the time I don’t finish it off until 2 in the morning . ‘So I get in trouble at school a lot but I have good intentions! But they're nice about it.’ Ben first found notoriety with his YouTube channel, uploading videos of Apple product reviews – including a montage of when Ben was the first person in Sydney to get his hands on the new iPad Air. ‘I’d love to work for myself in the future but if I had to work for any company, it’d definitely be Apple.’ Ben believes being a teenager gives him an edge as an entrepreneur. ‘Me being the young, the main target of apps, gives me an idea of what people want. This has been a great advantage. ‘No one in my team (developing ‘One’) is over the age of 22. I think younger people get the concept better.’ Ben turns to the Facebook group where it all began, High School Hackers, for support. Of his super successful app, Ben says, 'Impossible Rush was the first game I have made. It doesn’t represent my work - just a bit of fun' ‘I didn’t learn this at school, I have purely encouraged myself, I found an interest in this and pursued it. ‘Communities like HS Hackers are really encouraging. It’s nice to see people with similar interest to me.’ ‘The Facebook group is really cool. If I ever have a problem, I can post in one group and then instantly 2000 people who do the same thing as I do see it and can make suggestions. A priority for Ben is focussing on what will be liked by the masses, which means a sleek look and universal appeal. When it comes to One, he is a perfectionist. ‘When I look at technology I think how can I make it cool. We need to make it pretty, beautiful – that’s the marketing side I guess.’ Ben says seeing the app being played by strangers is the most exciting aspect of the experience. ‘It’s so cool. On any bus, any bus station… I can see people playing everywhere I go . 'It’s exciting, like my visions have happened.' The new app will be launched in the next one to two months.","Aussie 15-year-old created one of world's top apps with a US teenager .

"At least 15 Republicans are contemplating US presidential runs, and most of them will be wooing donors and seeking blessings of core conservatives this weekend at two crucial events laying groundwork for 2016. None of the candidates in waiting has officially launched a White House bid, and the first state-wide vote in the process to determine a party's nominee is a full 53 weeks away. But the competition to earn the imprimatur of conservative groups, far-right voters, and the mega-donors that have become indispensable to American political success breaks into the open Saturday and Sunday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . KING(MAKER): Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King put together the Freedom Summit to give conservatives in the GOP a chance to catch fire and gain presidential momentum . Almost had it: A supporter of dark-horse political newcomer Dr. Ben Carson waved a banner – sort of – at the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition convention on January 18 in Myrtle Beach . Time for some traffic problems in Des Moines: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will be in Iowa for the Freedom Summit on Saturday . Candidates charge out of the gate first in the heartland of Iowa, where anti-immigration congressman Steve King hosts the Iowa Freedom Summit. Of Saturday's speakers, no fewer than eight are believed to have their eyes on the White House. They include Senator Ted Cruz, a thorn in the party establishment's side; former Texas governor Rick Perry, whose 2012 presidential campaign crashed and burned; New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, battling sinking poll numbers; and mild-tempered neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a Tea Party favorite. Each will get 20 minutes to wow the 1,000-strong crowd -- a sort of political speed-dating session -- and experts say making a good impression at the start of the political cycle is crucial. 'It is the kickoff, (and) will set the tone for many of the contenders,' Iowa State University professor Steffen Schmidt told AFP. LET THE PANDERING BEGIN: Iowans stood in the cold as they lined up to enter the Freedom Summit on Saturday . An equally if not more influential event takes place Sunday in Palm Springs, California, where billionaire industrialists and political powerbrokers Charles and David Koch invited 450 conservative entrepreneurs and donors to their annual winter retreat. Several 2016 hopefuls will attend, including Republican senators Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, who are scheduled to square off in a three-way forum Sunday. But notably absent in Iowa are former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Rand Paul. Bush, the son and brother of two presidents, and Romney, a two-time candidate himself are viewed as establishment Republicans, occupying the political space more to the middle than those headed to Iowa or California. On Thursday, Bush and Romney met privately in Utah, in a possible sign of their future intentions. The Koch network marshals vast funding to advance free-market policies. For many GOP candidates, being on the right side of that network is essential. 'Whether we like it or not, one of the first primaries in either party is the fundraising primary, and having access to that network helps you,' Republican strategist Greg Mueller told The New York Times. The retreat is invitation-only. But this year, organizers have taken a new tack, and a webcast will be made available to reporters. No compromise: Senator Ted Cruz is a tea party favorite and promises to wow Iowa conservatives with a small-government message that takes President Barack Obama head-on . 'Oops' part deux? Texas Governor Rick Perry is trying to recover from a crash-and-burn 2012 candidacy and may try again in 2016 . 'Our goal in 2015 is to help inform the national debate around key domestic economic issues, and this forum is the beginning of that conversation,' said Freedom Partners spokesman James Davis. The Koch brothers' political influence has become profound. One organization in the Koch network, Americans For Prosperity, spent a reported $120 million in 2012 opposing Obama and congressional Democrats. Such is the Democratic antipathy for the Kochs that when Senate Republican leaders limited debate in the chamber Thursday night, opponents accused them of rushing proceedings to give lawmakers time to get to the retreat. 'Jet fumes have a whiff of Koch,' sneered senior Senate Democratic aide Adam Jentleson. Democrats too have their deep-pocketed donors, which the party's 2016 hopefuls will court. But with all eyes on Hillary Clinton as the prospective frontrunner, the scramble for Democratic donor backing is less frantic than on the Republican side.","Iowa Freedom Summit is the first major cattle-call for Republicans in advance of the 2016 Iowa Caucuses .

"Jane Doe #1 was the first girl to accuse billionaire Jeffrey Epstein (pictured) of sexual abuse . The first girl to accuse billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse has claimed she was 14 when she was paid £130 to give him a massage wearing just her knickers. The girl, known only as Jane Doe #1, claims she was taken to Epstein's mansion by one of his associates in February 2005 and forced to straddle him as he bragged about his business conquests and 'different girlfriends'. The teenager - who had been told to lie to Epstein about her age - also claims the disgraced tycoon paid her an extra £65 after masturbating in front of her and using a vibrator on her. The extraordinary claims come just weeks after Prince Andrew was thrown into the spotlight following a series of lurid allegations about his friendship with Epstein. The Duke of York has been accused of sleeping with a 'sex slave' who was allegedly loaned out by Epstein to a series of his high-profile friends. Virginia Roberts - also known on court papers as Jane Doe #3 - alleges she was 17 when she slept with Prince Andrew in 2001, a claim the royal strenuously denied. In an unprecedented move last week, the duke used a televised speech in Davos to ‘reaffirm’ Buckingham Palace’s emphatic denials that he had ever had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with his accuser. Separately, Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution with a minor and was jailed for 18 months. Jane Doe #1's allegations, which she made in 2005 in a series of affidavits to police, led to a wave of alleged victims coming forward and claiming they had also been abused by Epstein at his Florida mansion. In her first extraordinary interview since the allegations were made, Jane Doe #1 - whose anonymity is protected - told how she was living with her father and step-mother in West Palm Beach, Florida, when she was approached by one of her neighbours and asked if she would like to give a massage to a 'rich man'. She told The Daily Beast how the woman - who police say admitted being one of Epstein's procurers - told her to pretend she was 18, if asked by Epstein. She then revealed how she was taken to his El Brillo Way mansion, where an assistant led her to the a fold-out massage table in the bathroom connected to the master bedroom. It was there she was told to strip down to just her underwear and allegedly presented with a range of lotions to use on the billionaire, she claims. Although she was terrified, the girl said she stayed because she did not want Epstein to become suspicious that she had lied about her age. According to the girl, Epstein then entered wearing just a bath towel and immediately told her to take off her bra. The victim (left), who cannot be identified, told how Epstein (right) asked her to strip down to just her knickers before carrying out the massage at his Florida mansion . She said: 'I was a little shrimp, didn't have boobs, and didn't look 18 at all. My face, the way I spoke, and my body didn't look like I was 18.' During the massage, Jane Doe #1 says Epstein told her about his business conquests and his different girlfriends. Virginia Roberts, known as Jane Doe #3, has also made allegations against Epstein as well as Prince Andrew. The royal denies the claims . He also asked her to sit on him 'piggy-back style' to carry out the massage as she was too short to reach him properly, she claims. Once the massage was over, Epstein allegedly told her to 'write down your name and telephone number in the little pad next to the couch', before leaving the room. Jane Doe #1 was taken back to her house and never saw him again. But the story unraveled after she told her close friend at school about the encounter. The rumours soon spread around the school and reached the principal, who reported the incident to the police and encouraged Jane Doe #1 to testify against Epstein. According to Jane Doe #1, she was harassed and 'bullied' by one of Epstein's lawyers during the court proceedings. But, despite testifying to a court, she says she did not hear from prosecutors until 2008, by which time Epstein had already negotiated the non-prosecution agreement (NPA). Experts in criminal law in America still question how Epstein’s legal team pulled off the deal that saw him avoid a jail sentence of ten to 20 years. Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, the name used in US legal proceedings for people with anonymity, are now suing the U.S government over the NPAs. They claim the government failed to protect their rights when it entered a plea deal with Epstein. Two more women, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4, now want to join the case. It is the woman known as Jane Doe #3 - Ms Roberts - who has made claims regarding Prince Andrew. Since Jane Doe #1 made her claims, 40 women have come forward claiming that Epstein abused them too. Almost all have settled their cases. A spokesman for Epstein declined to comment. He said all Epstein's statements have been and will be made in legal papers filed with the court.

"She may be known as Westminster's most embarrassing wife after posting a series of revealing 'cleavage selfies' on Twitter. But Rochdale councillor Karen Danczuk, 31, dubbed 'Trampy Karen' at school, has said she is 'infuriated' by claims that she is a bad role model - as she posts another figure-hugging picture. The mother-of-two, married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 48, whose book prompted the inquiry into historic child abuse allegations at Westminster, recently came head-to-head with Janet Street-Porter on Loose Women. Scroll down for video . Rochdale councillor Karen Danczuk, dubbed 'Trampy Karen' at school, posted two more figure-hugging pictures yesterday showing her weight loss . The mother-of-two, 31, has said she is 'infuriated' by claims that she is setting a bad example for other women . She became embroiled in a discussion with the journalist who said she was setting a bad example to girls in Rochdale, where sex–trafficking gangs were convicted of abusing hundreds of girls in 2012. 'That just infuriated me her telling me how I should set an example for girls [she has] no idea what it's like to be…' Mrs Danczuk told the Daily Telegraph. 'They have no idea what my past is, and what the girls went through. No idea. I don't mind someone having a go at me, but don't blame child sex abuse on me because I happen to occasionally wear a low–cut top. 'If I want to walk down the street in a bikini, that doesn't excuse a group of disgusting men forming a paedophile ring. There are no excuses for those sick men. I will not be blamed for [their actions] because I happen to be comfortable in my skin.'

"The wife of the Sydney man Mohamed Elomar who is fighting with the extremist group ISIS in Syria is planning a legal challenge against the Australian government, saying terrorism charges against her are 'unconstitutional'. Fatima Elomar, a mother of four who was arrested trying to board an international flight earlier this year to allegedly join husband Mohamed in Syria, appeared in a Sydney court on Tuesday morning. Ms Elomar, 30, is charged with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. Scroll down for video .

The accused, whose face was uncovered during the brief court hearing, then exited the court wearing a full-face niqab, just as she had done at her previous court hearing when she and her four children left the court draped in cloths and blankets.

High court bid: Fatima Elomar (above) with her lawyer, Zali Burrows, leaving a central Sydney court after she briefly appeared on foreign incursion charges is planning to appeal against the Federal Government charging her in the first place, saying the matters are unconstitutional . Ms Elomar said she was travelling on holiday with her with her two young sons, daughter and baby. In the months since Ms Elomar's arrest, husband Mohamed Elomar has become one of ISIS's 'poster' Aussie terrorists, posing in the besieged Syrian town of al Raqqa with a pair of severed heads and posting the photos on social media. Through her lawyer, Ms Elomar has said she is a ‘devoted mother’ of her four children and described the charges against her as ‘serious and over-zealous’. Ms Elomar (above, leaving the Downing Centre on Tuesday) appears in court with her face bare before covering up when she emerges onto the street . The Brisbane woman has remained in Sydney and reported to police while on bail, and has had to send her children to schools here. In a statement released following her arrest through her lawyer, Zali Burrows, Ms Elomar said her children had suffered enough from not being able to visit Malaysia for a holiday, which she claims was her only intended destination when she boarded the plane. 'The ordeal of being interviewed without their mother, being unable to return home to their friends and school, having to adjust to a new way of life of reporting in to the police station with mum, and the task of trying to make new friends at a new school in a new state,’ Ms Burrows said. She told Daily Mail Australia Ms Elomar would be mounting a legal challenge in the High Court of Australia against the foreign incursion charges under the Crimes Act. Ms Burrows could not give a date when the challenge would be filed but said she had made the High Court aware of the looming application. Ms Elomar's husband, Mohamed, is the nephew of convicted terrorist Mohamed Elomar, who plotted with four other men in 2005 to bomb targets in a bid to force Australia's government to change its policy on Middle East conflicts. Mr Elomar is believed to have flown to Syria late last year with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport. Mr Sharrouf has also posted photographs of himself and his children allegedly from Syria on social media, with one of his sons posing with a severed head. Ms Elomar said earlier this year through Ms Burrows that her arrest highlighted the pitfalls for travellers packing camouflage gear as a fashion item. 'At the end of the day this is an example of one must be careful what you pack to travel, let it be a travel warning to leave the camouflage pants at home and best check with Smart Traveller as to what the acceptable fashion is,’ she said. Ms Elomar's case was adjourned until December 16 so prosecutors could seek further documentation as the Federal Attorney General's office prepares a brief for prosecution.

"Benedict Cumberbatch (pictured) has hit out at the lack of opportunities for black British actors . Benedict Cumberbatch has hit out at the lack of opportunities for black British actors – and says they have a far better chance of success in Hollywood than the UK. The 38-year-old, nominated for an Oscar for The Imitation Game, told US interviewer Tavis Smiley that stars such as Idris Elba and David Oyelowo thrive in America more than at at home. The Sherlock star pointed to films such as Selma and 12 Years A Slave, saying: ‘It’s an even playing field. [These actors] paid their dues for years by just doing beautiful performances. ‘I think as far as coloured actors go it gets really difficult in the UK, and a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the US] than in the UK and that’s something that needs to change. ‘As long as we pay our taxes over here when we work, I think it’s fair game. Meryl Streep can come over and play Margaret Thatcher. 'Why can’t we come over and play in your sand pit?’ He commended the comedian Lenny Henry, who campaigns for more work for minorities in the UK, calling him ‘a real force for good’. He said: ‘He’s rightfully launched a campaign because something’s gone wrong. . . I don’t want to get involved in any debates about that, but it’s clear when you see certain migratory patterns that there are more opportunities here than there are in the UK.’ Black British actors are currently storming Tinseltown. Oyelowo, who moved to Los Angeles seven years ago in a bid to find more work, plays Martin Luther King Jr in Selma – which stars another Brit, Carmen Ejogo, as King’s wife Coretta Scott King. Many expected Oyelowo to be nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, and his snub by the academy has prompted a discussion about lack of diversity in this year’s awards.

Benedict Cumberbatch, 38, said stars such as Idris Elba (left) and David Oyelowo (right) thrive in America more than at at home . Last year, Briton Chiwetel Ejiofor won an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Solomon Northup in 12 Years A Slave – in which Cumberbatch also appeared. Idris Elba played Stringer Bell in HBO’s series The Wire, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw was lauded by critics in 2013 film Belle. Cumberbatch also said that he had no rivalry with Eddie Redmayne, tipped to beat him to the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. He joked: ‘I’m very proud of my work. I don’t mind if I’m the guy who’s the bridegroom and someone else is the bride.’","The 38-year-old hits out at the lack of opportunities for black British actors .

The other aid workers are thought to have been released, but ISIS demanded $6million for the American woman's release as recently as 2014. As part of the deal, ISIS also demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, an MIT-trained neuroscientist who was convicted in 2010 of trying to kill U.S. officials and accused of planning the construction of dirty bombs to be used in terrorist attacks. Mr McDonough suffered a 'slip of the tongue' during an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week. As the pair discussed the current hostage situation, which has seen one Japanese prisoner reportedly killed by ISIS, Mr McDonough accidentally revealed the American hostage's name. 'As it relates to our hostages, we are obviously continuing to work those matters very, very aggressively,' Mr McDonough told Mr Stephanopoulos. Threat: Mr McDonough made the slip while discussing the current hostage situation involving two Japanese men, one of whom has allegedly been killed by ISIS . Hostage: The unnamed woman was kidnapped by ISIS while helping people displaced by the Syrian war along with other volunteers from a humanitarian aid group in August 2013 . 'We are sparing no expense and sparing no effort, both in trying to make sure that we know where they are and make sure that we're prepared to do anything we must to try to get them home. 'But [redacted] family knows how strongly the president feels about this, and we will continue to work this.' The woman's first name has not previously been released and security officials have requested for it to be redacted from reports on Mr McDonough's interview. McDonough's slip came as President Obama, currently on a three-day state visit to India, offered his condolences to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the killing of a Japanese national by ISIS. In a statement from the White House, the President said that the United States will stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Japan. The Japanese government is still reviewing an online video that purports to show the murder of ISIS prisoner Haruna Yukawa. The U.S. President  also called for the immediate release of the second Japanese hostage being held by the militants, Kenji Goto.","Denis McDonough revealed first name of American ISIS hostage .

"Former Team Sky doctor Geert Leinders has been banned for life for multiple doping violations, the United States Anti-Doping Agency has announced. Leinders was banned for violations committed while he was the chief team doctor and a director of the Rabobank cycling team between 1996 and 2009. Leinders worked for Sky on a freelance basis in 2011 and 2012, but his employment caused the team great embarrassment given their public commitment to anti-doping, and team principal Sir Dave Brailsford later described it as a mistake. Former Team Sky doctor Geert Leinders (centre) has been banned for life for multiple doping violations . The USADA said in a statement: 'After a hearing at which the detailed evidence, including eyewitness testimony, corroborating documentation and an expert analysis of abnormal blood values of cyclists was presented, the independent arbitration panel found that Leinders possessed, trafficked, and administered banned performance-enhancing substances and methods without any legitimate medical need, including EPO, blood transfusion paraphernalia, testosterone, insulin, DHEA, LH and corticosteroids to athletes under his care, and was complicit in other anti-doping rule violations.' The USADA said it had discovered evidence of doping by Rabobank during the course of an investigation in 2012, and worked with its equivalent organisations in Denmark and Holland to bring Leinders to account. In 2007, Rabobank sacked Danish rider Michael Rasmussen while he was leading the Tour de France after he admitted he had lied to the UCI about his whereabouts during training. The violations committed while he was the chief team doctor a director of the Rabobank  between 1996-2009 . Rasmussen later admitted to doping extensively during his career, saying he had done so from 1998 to 2010. He rode for Rabobank from 2003 until his dismissal in 2007. Rasmussen, 40, co-operated with the USADA in the investigation of Leinders. Commenting on the decision, USADA chief executive Travis Tygart said: 'It shocks the conscience that a board member and team doctor would abuse his trusted position by overseeing and participating in this type of dangerous and fraudulent activity. 'This case also demonstrates the global commitment of independent anti-doping organizations to ensuring that those who break the rules in an attempt to win and to profit from their cheating are held accountable. 'As we said from the beginning of our cycling investigation, ridding those in the system who attempt to justify doping as a means to an end is the only way to truly clean up cycling for current and future generations of athletes.' Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford (left) admitted it had been a mistake to hire Leinders . Sky hired Leinders after their soigneur Txema Gonzalez died suddenly during the 2010 Vuelta a Espana. The 43-year-old died of septic shock after contracting a bacterial infection. Sky had previously hired UK-based doctors with no connection to road cycling in order to remain free from the stain of doping, but Brailsford turned to Leinders concerned that he had left the team short on knowledge of how to prepare riders for the rigours of Grand Tours. Leinders was dismissed in 2012 as Sky introduced a zero-tolerance policy with regards to those linked with doping. During the 2013 Tour de France, won by Chris Froome, Brailsford was asked about the decision to hire Leinders as Froome was facing daily questioning about doping. 'The reality is that the thing is my responsibility. I'll take that squarely on the chin, it's something I'll always regret,' he said of Leinders' hiring. 'It allowed people the licence to ask these questions of Chris now, but it's not his fault. I made an error of judgement, quite frankly. When someone looks you in the eye and lies to you... I'm pretty angry about it.' Leinders was dismissed in 2012 as Sky introduced a zero-tolerance policy with those linked with doping .","Geert Leinders has been banned for life for multiple doping violations .

"Organisers of the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire are convinced the race has the capability to become the number one short tour on the international cycling calendar. The stages for the three-day event, a direct legacy of last summer's spectacularly successful Tour de France Grand Depart in the county, were revealed at a press conference in Bridlington on Wednesday. The east coast resort will host the start of the first stage on May 1, while the race - whose route will re-trace some sections of that used for the Tour de France - finishes in Leeds on May 3. Team Sky riders , including Chris Froome (right), cycling up a cobbled street in Haworth last summer . Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome To Yorkshire, told Press Association Sport: 'Our aspiration for this is clear, and that is to make it the best race of its kind in the world. 'We want to do that quickly and we want to make sure for our kids and my grandkids the race goes on and on - we want to have 100 new chapters for Yorkshire, not just one. 'We said when we did the Tour de France that we wanted to host the grandest ever Grand Depart so that people from around the world would come and ask, 'How did you do that?' The Grand Depart in Yorkshire last summer created fantastic scenes as thousands turned out to watch . 'We want to do that again this this race. We want to do it in such a way that people say, 'Look, if you're doing a short bike race, which is the best on the planet?' And we want them to say the Tour de Yorkshire.' After leaving Bridlington, stage one will weave up the east coast towards Scarborough before cutting through Dalby Forest towards Pickering and up over the North Yorkshire Moors to Whitby, from where it will return down the coast to Scarborough. Stage two, which has been designed with sprinters in mind, will start in Selby and include Beverley and Malton on its itinerary before finishing with a circuit of the city in York, which hosted the start of stage two of the Tour de France. Team Sky reach the summit at Holme Moss Moor in Yorkshire during stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France . Stage three from Wakefield will head through Barnsley before re-living the iconic Tour de France sight of a charge up the Haworth cobbles. It will re-trace much of the Tour de France route in reverse as it descends Cragg Vale on its way to the finish at Roundhay Park. The race has been jointly organised by Welcome To Yorkshire and the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), which is responsible for the Tour de France. Tour de France Sports Director Thierry Gouvenou, who designed the race route, said: 'Yorkshire offers so much with its huge variety of landscapes. 'For this first edition we have three quite different stages, each with their own challenges and seen as a whole, a very exciting addition to European racing.' The inaugural Tour de Yorkshire will follow the same route as last summer's three Grand Depart stages . Rotherham-born Team Sky sprinter Ben Swift said he is relishing the opportunity of racing in front of his home fans after missing out on the opportunity to take part in last year's Tour de France. Swift said: 'It was disappointing not to make the cut for the Tour de France especially as it was going through roads I trained and grew up on - but the legacy of Tour de Yorkshire is brilliant. 'I had mixed feelings watching the Tour de France on TV - I was tired after a long season so it was nice to sit at home, but it was also hard to watch in the knowledge that I was missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity. 'All this makes up for that a bit. It is a follow-on from how successful cycling has become in Britain and with the level it is coming in at it is just going to be a hit straight away.'","Yorkshire hosted the first three stages of the 2014 Tour de France .

"Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford admits it will be difficult to replace Sir Bradley Wiggins when the former Tour de France winner leaves the squad in April. Wiggins will begin work with his own cycling team in a bid to secure a fifth Olympic gold on the track at Rio 2016. The 34-year-old has been with Sky since their launch five years ago and he secured their first Tour victory two years later. Sir Bradley Wiggins' relationship with Team Sky will end in April as he prepares to launches own cycling team . 'As soon as you think about trying to replace someone like Bradley, you back yourself into a corner,' said Brailsford. 'His contribution to this team has been phenomenal, absolutely remarkable. 'We set out to win the Tour with a clean, British rider and that's what he did. 'He's an incredible athlete, he's one of the most versatile athletes the sport has ever seen - he can ride on the track, win time trials, win mountain stages. 'That's why we all believe he can be a great athlete even as he comes to the end of his career.' Wiggins has also set his sights on breaking 'The Hour Record' - riding as far as possible in 60 minutes - but not before trying to seal a first Spring Classic victory for Sky at Paris-Roubaix on April 12. He finished ninth in the event last year and Brailsford believes a win on the cobbles would complete an already superb career-record. 'If he can win the Paris-Roubaix he'll have one of the most awesome records any rider in this sport has ever had,' Brailsford said. Wiggins won the Tour de France in 2012, beating team-mate Chris Froome (left), who won the year after . Wiggins is also a seven-time Olympic medal winner - four of them are golds . 'He wants to the do the hour-record and then finish up at the track in the Olympics. 'If he could finish his story where he started out with a medal round his neck in Rio, that would be one hell of an ending. 'And knowing Bradley he'll want to find the next Bradley as well. 'He was given an opportunity and he'll want to give someone else that opportunity, which is a great thing.' Wiggins' mantle has been take over at Team Sky by Chris Froome, who will be gunning for his second Tour de France crown in July after last year's defence ended with a crash at stage five. 'There's no pressure on him this time and I think that's how we're framing it,' Brailsford said. 'As a team we want to win the Tour for a third time and if we don't we'll try again the next year. 'Chris is in a good place. He's in a better place than I've seen him for a long, long time. 'He had a difficult year last year with his crashes and he's bounced back from that. 'He's hungry, you can tell he's hungry but he's measured. He's in a terrific place.' Team Sky boss Sir David Brailsford praised Wiggins and said he wasn't looking forward to  replacing him .

'Even against Wrexham in the last round we had something like 10 internationals on the field of play,' he said. 'It's a trophy we have a good opportunity to win. But you need a bit of luck in terms of opposition, and in games because sometimes it can hit somebody on the backside and you lose.

"Kevin Pietersen’s Australian adventure came to an end here in Perth on Sunday but not before he provided one vintage glimpse of the talent that made him one of England’s greatest batsmen. Pietersen’s Kevin Pietersen bowed out of the Australian Big Bash when they were defeated by Perth Scorchers in the semi-final of a competition that has showcased much of what is good in modern Twenty20 cricket. Yet Pietersen gave an Australian public that has warmed to him something to remember with a switch-hit for six that conjured up memories of his prime before everything went so badly wrong with England. Kevin Pietersen gives fans a glimpse of why his talent made him one of England's greatest batsman . ‘That’s the shot of the tournament,’ cooed commentator Damien Fleming as Pietersen hit left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg for a six that was measured at 86 metres and for a moment we were transported back to Durham seven years ago when Pietersen unveiled his extraordinary left-handed hit against Scott Styris. It was not enough for Melbourne as, with Perth turning the screw, Pietersen was unable to conjure up the match-winning performance so much of Australia would have welcomed with the England side that spurned him also in town. So it was Perth, complete with another discarded England batsman in Michael Carberry, who thrilled the capacity crowd at the WACA – or The Furnace as it is known for the Big Bash – by reaching Wednesday’s final against Sydney. Pietersen leads the Melbourne Stars on to the field ahead of the Semi Final match with the Perth Scorchers . Pietersen was out for 31 off 27 balls as Melbourne failed to reach Perth’ s 144 and was unable to add a decisive contribution to the three half centuries that have made him one of the outstanding performers of the tournament. Melbourne fell 20 short of that to the delight of a Perth crowd who provided another glowing reference for a competition that has provided a template for England to follow if the new regime at the ECB are brave enough to implement it. To watch Pietersen on Sunday was to be reminded of something I wrote this time last year when England decided that enough was enough and they should rebuild without a gifted player who became more trouble than he was worth. Pietersen was out for 31 off 27 balls as Melbourne failed to reach Perth’ s 144 . It is possible, I said, to be sad about the sacking of Pietersen while also firmly believing it is the right decision and that is as true today as it was when the wounds were raw even though he has sparkled in this year’s Big Bash. Nobody doubted that Pietersen was still capable of the odd flash of genius and it will be hugely satisfying to him that he has shown that here after being released by both Surrey and Delhi in the aftermath of his England demotion. It was a wicked twist of fate that brought Pietersen here the day after England arrived to take on India in the tri-series but there was to be no fairytale script for him, with Peter Moores ensconced in a hotel barely a switch hit away. Michael Carberry of the Scorchers hits out during the Big Bash League Semi Final match . John Hastings of the Stars collides with Andrew Tye of the Scorchers . Instead Perth and Hampshire’s Carberry hit a decisive half century to show Moores that Pietersen is not the only ex-England batsman in the Big Bash nursing a grievance and anxious to prove a point. So Pietersen has, to a large extent, proved here that he can defy the flickering flame of his talent for a little while yet and continue earning a lucrative living around the world while trying to provide more embarrassment for England. But what happens next to him will be fascinating. He admitted here on Saturday when he talked enthusiastically and with much cricketing sense that he will have to give his next move some ‘serious thought.’ Pietersen's Australian adventure came to an end in Perth on Sunday as they failed to beat the hosts total . Sportsmail understands that Surrey have no intention of re-signing him so it is possible he has played in English cricket for the last time, particularly with the ECB’s surprise move last week to reduce the counties salary cap. If he was really serious about proving to England that he is still good and committed enough to play for them again, of course, he should knuckle down and play first-class cricket again, irrespective of the size of the pay-packet. His friend Matt Maynard may be inclined give him the chance to do that now he has become Somerset’s coach but if, as expected, Pietersen would prefer to cash in on Twenty20 riches in India and the Caribbean then everyone should just accept that England are moving on without him. And enjoy any glimpses of his still rare ability when they are provided, as was briefly the case yesterday. The Scorchers celebrate after defeating the Stars in the semi-final Big Bash game . It must certainly be hoped that Colin Graves, expected to be made new chairman of the ECB, and new chief executive Tom Harrison have been watching Sky’s coverage of this excellently marketed and hyped tournament. The Big Bash has proved that franchise cricket, watched by big crowds paying very reasonable prices, in a short sharp event can work, even though standards are not noticeably better than England’s much derided NatWest Blast. Franchise cricket has been kept at arm’s length by nervous counties up to now but if England are to reclaim the bragging rights in the format they gave to the world then it really should be considered by the ECB’s new broom. That would be something that Pietersen would approve of English cricket’s governing body doing.

"Still those pesky Aussies cannot be beaten. England did almost everything right but came off second-best yet again against an under-strength home side in what became a thrilling finish at the Bellerive Oval. This was a golden chance wasted for England who, thanks to a sublime 141 from Ian Bell, had Australia down and almost out only to endure a miserable last 10 overs with the bat and then just fail to defend a still decent 303 for eight. At the centre of Australia’s third successive win in this Tri-series was Steve Smith, surely the most improved player in world cricket and now the match-winner in his first game as captain against England. Steve Smith's century formed the backbone of Australia's innings as they overcame England . Smith celebrates reaching three figures for Australia in the game against England in Hobart . When Smith, leading Australia in the absence of the suspended George Bailey, was joined by England’s old bete noire in Brad Haddin, his side still needed 88 from 76 balls and the game was in the balance. Yet the pair took their side to the brink and, even after Chris Woakes snared Haddin and induced a late wobble, Australia sneaked home with a ball in hand to leave England needing to beat India again in Perth next Friday to make sure of their place in the final of this pre-World Cup tournament. ‘I haven’t seen Australia produce death bowling like that for a very long time,’ said England captain Eoin Morgan. ‘They made things very difficult for us. We were dominant for the first 40 overs and looked set for a commanding total, probably 340, but we didn’t manage to get there.’ Morgan himself was out first ball, but he insisted that the bizarre case of a failed blackmail plot in the build-up did not distract him. ‘It hasn’t been distracting at all,’ he said. ‘I spoke to the ECB and I was very happy for them to deal with it. They just told me to focus on my cricket 100 per cent and I’ve done that. It wasn’t easy when I came in. The ball was reverse swinging. I nicked one. It happens.’ Australia's victory was secured in the final over of the tri-series match . Ian Bell hit a century against Australia to move past Paul Collingwood's previous record of 5,092 runs . This, though, was a magnificent effort from Bell. It was all very well hitting 187 in a warm-up match, but this was the real deal, a big hundred against Australia and easily the best and the quickest of his four one-day international centuries ahead of the World Cup. In the process Bell passed 5,000 one-day runs and overtook Paul Collingwood as England’s leading runscorer in the format but the fact that 10 players worldwide have scored more than 10,000 tells you all you need to know about England’s under-achievement. Here, Bell even outscored the designated hitter in Moeen Ali — at least until Ali smacked three sixes in successive balls from Pat Cummins — in a stand of 113 in fewer than 18 overs that bodes well for the World Cup battles ahead. ‘Belly has been awesome,’ said Morgan. ‘Since we touched down he’s really shown his experience and class. He’s led from the front in training and it’s really paid off. It’s a privilege to have someone like him in the squad.’ Warwickshire-born Bell is only the second Englishman to surpass 5,000 ODI runs for his country . It should have provided the launch pad for an impregnable total but judged by the very highest standards England will be disappointed that they could not score at least 30 more. When they were poised at 175 for two after 30 overs — and even when they stood at 244 for two after 40 — England looked set for 350 but they had a miserable final 10 overs when the platform was built for their hitters. Joe Root proved the perfect foil for Bell in a stand of 121 from 19 overs but a middle order packed with dynamism stalled and spluttered. Yes, Australia’s bowling at the death, mainly from Mitchell Starc, proved mightily effective but England should have managed more than 59 off the last 10 overs for the loss of six wickets, three falling off the last three balls. Joe Root assisted Bell's innings with 69 coming from 100 deliveries but England could not defend their total . Ravi Bopara should ask himself how he could score only seven off 16 balls while Jos Buttler was not much better with 25 from 24 balls. It felt as if England had fallen short but when Steven Finn found early reverse swing and took two wickets in three balls they were favourites for an important victory. But while Smith, a run machine in the Test series against India, was still there England could not rest easy and even when Australia lost their finisher James Faulkner they were still able to pace their chase almost perfectly. Smith finished unbeaten on 102, with Starc scurrying the winning run off his first ball, and England were left wondering what might have been. ‘It’s frustrating but it’s still early in the trip and we’re making strides,’ said Morgan. ‘Today was a learning curve for us.’ Australia’s psychological hold continues ahead of their World Cup opener against England in Melbourne on February 14. But only just.","England had posted 303 in their innings and Ian Bell made 141 .

"The Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews has voted 'overwhelmingly' in favour of welcoming women members, it has been announced. The club's annual autumn meeting saw members vote 85 per cent in favour of the change in membership rules that have stood for its 260-year history. After the vote Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, said: 'The R&A is now a mixed-sex club. The Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews has voted 85 per cent in favour of allowing women members . Of the 2,400 men who make up the global R&A membership, about two-thirds took the opportunity to make history at the club. 'This is an important and positive day in the history of the R&A Golf Club,' Dawson said. 'The R&A has served the sport of golf well for 260 years and I am confident that the club will continue to do so in future with the support of all its members, both women and men.' Dawson confirmed a 'significant' number of women in prominent positions within the golfing community will be fast-tracked into membership at the exclusive club. Sports minister Helen Grant called on other clubs with similar restrictions to follow the R&A's lead. 'I am pleased that the members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews have voted in favour of admitting women members,' she said. 'This is positive news for the sport and I hope we will now see other golf clubs that still have outdated same sex policies follow suit. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, says 'The R&A is now a mixed-sex club.' 'With golf in the next Olympics there is a huge opportunity for the sport to grow and this sends out the right inclusive message that golf is for everyone.' Cabinet Secretary for Sport and Equalities Shona Robison also praised the decision, adding: 'In the week before Scotland welcomes golf fans from across the world for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, this decision by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews to admit women members is another step on the road to full equality in sport and society. 'This decision by the world's most exclusive and prestigious golf club sees real progress towards making golf a more equal sport, which is very important. 'We firmly believe that there should be no barriers at all to being involved in sport with everyone able to participate in and enjoy sport - whoever they are and whatever their background. I hope this welcome development leads to the few remaining single-gender golf clubs to take a similar path.' When the vote was announced in March, Dawson insisted it was not intended to place pressure on the three male-only clubs on the Open Championship rota, but such an interpretation is unavoidable. Pressure from sponsors had been mounting, with HSBC's global head of sponsorship and events Giles Morgan saying in January that: ''The R&A are clear that it's a very uneasy position for the bank.' Sweden's Annika Sorenstam tees off on the 18th at St Andrews in the 2007 Women's British Open pro-am . Morgan said on Thursday: 'As a partner of the R&A and a long-term international sponsor of golf, we welcome this news with open arms. 'HSBC is committed to growing the game at all levels and fundamental to this is our commitment to the value of diversity and our support of women's golf which is a cornerstone of our global golf portfolio. 'As a patron of the oldest and most prestigious of all major championships, we are proud to be a partner of The Open Championship which creates a centre of gravity in our global golf portfolio. We look forward to continuing this successful partnership at St Andrews in 2015 for what promises to be the start of a new era.' Muirfield, Royal Troon and Royal St George's are the three clubs on the 10-strong rota with male-only membership policies, although Troon feels it should not be directly compared to the other two as it shares its facilities with The Ladies Golf Club Troon. Muirfield, which is owned and run by The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, is reviewing its membership criteria with a report to be completed by March 2015, while Royal St George's is also 'considering its position' as a single-sex club.","The R&A have voted to allow women to join the club as members .

"Australia coach Darren Lehmann has no intention of saving Mitchell Johnson for a World Cup assault on England and will recall the paceman as soon as possible. Johnson was the runaway man-of-the-series in last winter's Ashes and there are serious concerns about how England will react should he find his very best form again in the tournament opener in Melbourne on February 14. He has been missing for the last few weeks with fitness niggles and undisclosed personal reasons, and there have been suggestions Lehmann might hold his strike bowler back until that match, denying England closer look should they reach the final of the ongoing Tri-Series.

"Most wanted: Zulkifli bin Abdul Hir, leader of an al Qaeda linked terror group in Asia, has apparently been killed in an air strike on a southern Philippines island . South-east Asia's most-wanted terrorist and two other senior militants were killed today in a U.S.-backed air strike in the Philippines, military chiefs said. Malaysian Zulkifi bin Hir, known as Marwan, a top leader of the al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah terror network was apparently killed in a dawn strike on a militant stronghold on a southern island. The leader of the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf militants, Umbra Jumdail, and Singaporean leader in Jemaah Islamiyah, Abdullah Ali, were also apparently killed. The bodies of the three men have not yet been recovered from the heavily-forested mountain camp because the area remains under the control of another rebel group - the Moro National Liberation Front - so their deaths have not been officially confirmed. Major General Noel Coballes said no one was captured in the strike and some militants escaped, before returning later to retrieve the bodies of those who died. Around 30 militants were in the camp near Parang town on Jolo Island - the Abu Sayyaf stronghold which they share with Indonesian-based Jemaah Islamiyah - when it was bombarded by two OV10 aircraft. Campaign: A wanted poster released by the Philippine military shows bin Hir on the middle row, left side. Two other militants, Umbra Jumdail (top row, second right) and Abdullah Ali were also apparently killed . Maj Gen Coballes said: 'Our report is there were at least 15 killed, including their three leadership. 'This is a deliberate, fully planned attack coming from our forces.' The U.S. had offered a $5million reward for the capture of Marwan, a U.S.-trained engineer accused of involvement in a number of deadly bombings in the Philippines and in the training of new militants. Target: Abu Pula, also known as Dr Abu, was the leader of Abu Sayyaf and the militant stronghold was run by his group . American counter-terrorism troops have helped ill-equipped Filipino troops track Marwan for years using satellite and drone surveillance. Around 600 U.S. special forces have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002, providing a crucial support for its counter-terrorism operations. If confirmed, Marwan's death would mark the most important success against regional terror network Jemaah Islamiyah since the January 2011 arrest of Indonesian suspect Umar Patek in Pakistan's garrison town of Abottabad, where Osama bin Laden was killed in a U.S. commando attack four months later. Patek and Marwan collaborated with Abu Sayyaf in training militants in bomb-making skills, seeking funding locally and abroad and plotting attacks, including against American troops in the southern Philippines. Patek is believed to have travelled back to Indonesia and then onward to Pakistan, leaving Marwan to take charge in the southern Philippines, military officials said. Marwan's death would also be a huge blow to Abu Sayyaf's ability to recover from years of battle setbacks through fundraising and training of new militants. During today's attack, the Philippines air force dropped four bombs weighing 500lb each from two planes, said Major General Jose Villarete, head of the 3rd Air Division based in Zamboanga city. Operation: Colonel Marcelo Burgos displays a picture of bin Hir, known as Marwan. Bombs were dropped on the forest hideout, but the bodies of the three terrorists have not been recovered . Abu Sayyaf is behind numerous ransom kidnappings, bomb attacks and beheadings which have terrorised the Philippines for more than two decades. U.S.-backed Philippines offensives have been credited for the capture and killing of hundreds of Abu Sayyaf fighters and most top leaders since the 1990s. Jumdail, also known as Dr Abu, had eluded troops in numerous offensives and emerged as a key figure in the radical movement. Most recently, all three of the militant leaders were among the prime suspects in the kidnappings of three Red Cross workers from Switzerland, Italy and the Philippines in 2009. The hostages separately regained their freedom months later, reportedly after ransom payments. The military estimates the strength of Abu Sayyaf militants at about 400. They are still considered a key threat to the regional security. They are believed to be holding a former Australian soldier who was kidnapped before Christmas as well as a Malaysian, a Japanese and an Indian. Yesterday, gunmen on nearby Tawi-Tawi island province snatched Dutch and Swiss tourists and officials said they were attempting to move them to Jolo in an impoverished Muslim region 590 miles south of Manila.","Zulkifi bin Hir was U.S.-trained engineer behind series of deadly bombings in Philippines .

"A rescue helicopter crashed yesterday when it tried to take off with too many Iraqi refugees on board, killing the pilot and involving an Australian photographer. The pilot died and several children were injured in the drama on Mount Sinjar, where Yazidi and Christian civilians are besieged by Islamic State fighters. The Iraqi military helicopter, which was carrying aid and had been mobbed by desperate families, was brought down by sheer weight of numbers. Scroll down for video . Tears of relief: An Iraqi Air Force helicopter emergency aid delivery turned into a rescue mission today in northern Iraq . Australian photographer Adam Ferguson was involved in a helicopter crash while providing aid to Yazidi refugees . An army spokesman said too many people tried to climb on board the helicopter, which crashed killing pilot Major General Majid Ashour died and injuring New York Times reporter Alissa Rubin. War correspondent Ms Rubin, 56, was working on a story and travelling on the Mi-17 helicopter with Australian photographer Adam Ferguson, who told the Times he was not injured. In a statement Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi said Iraqi parliamentarian Vian Dakheel, who is from the minority Yazidi community, was also hurt in the crash. 'The helicopter delivered aid to the people stranded in Sinjar and too many people boarded it and it hit the mountain during takeoff,' the statement read. The injured were evacuated to a hospital in the nearby Kurdish region. Other aid flights – including one run by the RAF – have come under intense fire from the jihadi gunmen. Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border, on the outskirts of Sinjar mountain on August 11 . Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community arrive at Nowruz camp, in Derike, Syria on August 12 . The RAF Hercules plane was shot at as it brought food and water to the refugees on Monday night. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are helping the refugees escape the mountainside, said the small-arms fire missed the cargo plane. Thousands of people have been trapped for more than a week on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq in blistering 50C heat without shelter, food or water. They have fought to scramble aboard the few helicopters bringing humanitarian supplies. In one case, a father and a mother threw their two young daughters across a crowd on to a helicopter which took the children to safety, leaving the two parents behind. And a man clung desperately to the side of another helicopter before losing his grip and plunging to his death. Desperate: A woman clings on to a departing aid helicopter . The dramatic footage shows the moment a desperate woman clung onto an aid flight as it departed Mount Sinjar following the delivery of aid . Special forces are believed to be on the mountain with British and American intelligence officers in direct contact with leaders of the refugees. Special phones were dropped from a Hercules in the first RAF mercy mission, on Saturday. When switched on, they connect directly to Kurdish-speaking British or US agents. A source said: 'They are talking to the people on the mountain, and the questions they are asking are: Where are you? How long can you survive? How much water do you have? Where are the IS fighters?' Mirza Dinnay, a UN relief worker, told the BBC yesterday: 'It's a genocide. You find what looks like hundreds of dead people. Fleeing: The military helicopter crashed on a mountain as it tried to provide aid to the 500,000-strong Yazidi population in Sinjar (pictured), near the Syrian border, as they flee Sunni militants of the Islamic State . Horrific: The refugees are trying to find safety after Isil gave them the ultimatum: convert to Islam or die . 'Thousands of people are trying to save themselves. 'You can imagine what it is like when you land among 5,000 people and can take only ten or 20, and everybody tries to get on the helicopter. 'It's a dangerous situation because everybody pushes each other. Many haven't eaten for around nine days and they are living under the hot sun. 'Three days ago one man tried to get into the helicopter but he couldn't manage it. 'He then clung to the side as we took off but we couldn't help him get inside and within one or two minutes we were flying at around 100 metres, he fell down. Like in a Hollywood film, he died.' On another aid flight, there were chaotic scenes as an Iraqi army helicopter pilot agreed to let a handful of refugees on board but then relented and let 50 people including young children rush on – even though the aircraft has a passenger capacity of 15. The weight was too great for the helicopter to take off, until five men got out. The pilot, Major General Ahmed Saadi, told ITV News: 'I thought, God will be with us.' The picture was the same elsewhere on the mountain when a helicopter delivered food, shoes, nappies and condensed milk to a group seen waving makeshift white flags. It took away just 20 refugees, many seen weeping for loved ones they were forced to abandon. Some of those fleeing spoke of dozens of unburied bodies of people on the mountain who lost their battle for survival. The second RAF aid drop, on Monday night, contained more phones and also GPS equipment to help organise future aid drops. The RAF and Americans have between them delivered 20,000 gallons of water and 85,000 meals, plus 1,000 solar lanterns that can also be used to recharge mobile phones. Last night a government source said ministers were 'hardening up' plans to evacuate Mount Sinjar: 'We are working as fast as we can. It's a complicated operation.'","Russian-built Mi-17 helicopter crashed as too many tried to climb aboard .

"American-born Douglas McAuthur McCain was allegedly killed over the weekend fighting for ISIS in Syria . An American man believed to have been killed in Syria was there to fight alongside a terrorist group, most likely the Islamic State, a U.S. official said Tuesday. Investigators were aware that Douglas McAuthur McCain had traveled to the country to join a militant group, but they did not yet have his body and were still trying to verify information about his death, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss by name an ongoing investigation and spoke only on condition of anonymity. A relative, Kenneth McCain, told The Associated Press that the State Department had called to tell his family that Douglas McCain had been killed in Syria. ""We do not know if he was fighting anyone,"" he said. U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have expressed concern about the influence of hard-line jihadists who are among the rebels seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Assad. Officials say fighters from the U.S. or Europe looking to join the cause could become radicalized and import those influences and terrorist skills when they return home. It was unclear when McCain, who had most recently lived in San Diego, traveled to Syria. He grew up outside Minneapolis in the town of New Hope, where he graduated high school in 1999. A cousin, Kenyata McCain, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that she had spoken to McCain as recently as Friday and 'he was telling all of us he was in Turkey.' Scroll down for video . Minnesota criminal courts records show McCain had a few minor traffic offenses, including two instances where he was convicted of giving police a false name or ID in 2003 (left) and 2008 (right) 'I know that he had strong Muslim beliefs,' she told the newspaper. 'But I didn't know that he was in support of ISIS. I didn't think he would be.' At an apartment complex in New Hope, Shelly Chase remembered McCain as a friendly boy who welcomed her 9-year-old son, Isaac, when the Chase family moved in some two decades ago. Even though McCain was a few years older, the boys used to lift weights, hit punching bags and play basketball. Both Shelly Chase and her son, now 28, fought back tears as they talked about McCain. 'I'm holding in the tears, I really am, because this is hard. He was a good kid,' Shelly Chase said. 'Someone must have persuaded him.' Isaac Chase said he had always looked up to McCain. Chase joined the military in 2007, and said before he left, he knew McCain was running into trouble, sometimes smoking marijuana at the park. Minnesota criminal courts records show McCain had a few minor traffic offenses, including two instances where he was convicted of giving police a false name or ID.

McCain's American passport was found in his pocket along with $800 . in cash . He said he last talked to McCain in 2008 when he was home on leave. McCain told Isaac he was proud of him, and he was trying to straighten out his own life, Isaac said. FBI Director James Comey said in June that roughly 100 people had left the United States to join the conflict in Syria. Comey said the terrorism threat of today 'has spread, metastasized. ... The traveler problem makes it even more difficult, because the people going to Syria are not from any particular demographic. They're not from any particular part of the United States.' Comey's remarks came during a visit to the FBI's field office in Minneapolis, which has struggled in recent years with several young Somali-Americans leaving the United States to join the terror group al-Shabab in Somalia. FBI spokesman E.K. Wilson said agents continue to investigate reports that several young men have left the Minneapolis area for overseas locations, including Syria. 'We have done extensive outreach recently, as we have the last seven years, but we've had a concerted effort ... over the last few months,' he said, as reports of travel to Syria surfaced. Friends of McCain were incredulous after being told of the circumstances of his death. 'He was a goofball in high school,' a classmate told NBC. 'Doug was a fun guy to be around. Played basketball, joked a lot, had a small sense of humor. Got along with most … Wasn't the best athlete, but liked to play.” Another friend who would go to teen nights at the YMCA with McCain called him a 'good guy who loved his family and friends. 'He would be the light in anyone's darkness. He always made you smile with his goofy self.' After graduating in 1999, he stayed in Minnesota for some time according to his criminal record. He was arrested in 2000, at the age of 19, for disorderly conduct and then again in 2006 for obstruction. He was convicted on both charges. According to his Twitter, he converted to Islam around 2004, referring to himself as 'Duale ThaslaveofAllah' and his online posts become much more fervent. ISIS are an extremist group currently invading Iraq from Syria in an attempt to establish a caliphate. Last week they brutally beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video posted online . Among his likes on Facebook are the 'Quaran and Hadith' and 'The Black Flag' as well as Pizza Hut and the Chicago Bulls . At some point he traveled to Sweden where he performed sometimes as a rapper. Kevin Kohlin knew him there and says they often played basketball together and chatted about hip-hop music. 'We would talk just a little bit about religion,' Kohlin added. 'He respected my Christianity.' It appears that McCain crossed into Syria from Turkey in the last few months. He tweeted to another ISIS fighter in June his intention to join them in 'r town' - mostly likely meaning Raqqa . News of McCain's death comes as ISIS has demanded a $6.6million ransom for an American aid worker held hostage . McCain appears to have moved back to San Diego recently where he worked at a Somali restaurant for sometime. An acquaintance at the restaurant said he was normal and 'open-minded' and just 'wanted to be a good Muslim'. In September 2010, he posted an ominous image that had the caption, 'They are coming back soldiers of Allah.' His MySpace profile contains similar messages, with photographs of McCain with the Quaran captioned, 'The Quran is all I need in this life of sin.' In April, McCain retweeted an English translation of a speech given by an ISIS spokesman and soon after that was spotted in Turkey - a common entryway into Syria. McCain attended high school in Minnesota where he played for the basketball team, and once performed as a rapper . Three months ago, McCain met with friends at a Burger King in Istanbul where they talked about the NBA . In May, McCain began praising the decade anniversary of his conversion to Islam and began to message and friend self-declared jihadis online. On June 9, he tweeted to another ISIS fighter that 'I will be joining you guys soon'. He also asked if another jihadist had made it to 'r town' - most likely referencing the ISIS-stronghold city of Raqqa. Later he posted: 'I'm with the brothers now'. His last tweet was on August 19. Following his death, the Free Syrian Army shared pictures of McCain's passport and his body, showing off a distinctive neck tattoo. Several of McCain's friends and family members have taken to Facebook to mourn his loss. His younger sister  posted a collage of three pictures with her brother, and wrote a brief memorial. 'I really don't understand why and how and I have no words, I never thought this will be the way we say goodbye. You where my oldest brother, my biggest headache, the one I argue with the most, my words when I needed you to be. I can hear you now saying ""lele guess what, I'm awesome"" and that big brother you are This is absolutely unreal to me I love you big brother.'

"An Australian aircraft delivering aid packages to civilians in northern Iraq, was fired at by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) fighters last weekend. The C-130 Hercules avoided being hit despite flying as low as 300 metres above the ground in Amirli, to deliver 15 packages of water, food and hygiene parcels, according to News Corp Australia. Both heavy machine guns as well as smaller arms were reported to have fired at the transport plane which was making the delivery under the cover of darkness. The attack was quickly responded to with maximum force by US fighter jets which were providing top cover at the time. Scroll down for video . Mr Abbott also talked down reports of an Australian C-130 Hercules aircraft being fired at by extresmists last weekend saying he was not advised that they had directly come under fire . The worrying revelation comes after the announcement that Australian elite special forces soldiers in RAAF transport planes, will hand-deliver arms and munition to Kurdish fighters battling ISIS militants in Iraq instead of air-dropping weapons, Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said. The Australian C-17A Globemaster aircraft is expected to deposit the first load of military equipment within 24 hours at Erbil, News Corp reports. It comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott talked down involvement saying there was no 'boots on the ground' role planned for Australian forces in the multinational effort. 'We want to make sure that we know where the arms and munitions go when we deliver,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said on Sunday at a joint press conference with the Prime Minister. 'They will be landing and handing them over to officials from the Peshmerga.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott confirmed to reporters in Canberra on Sunday Australian planes would deliver military equipment to Iraq . The SAS soldiers are believed to be at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates and will accompany the RAAF C-130J Hercules and C-17A Globemaster aircraft when the equipment is transported, Fairfax Media reports. 'This is about what is right for our country and what is best for our world,' Mr Abbott said on Sunday. He described the situation overseas as 'severe' and spoke of a specific type of terrorist 'who hate us not because of what we do, but because of what we are'. Mr Abbott said he agreed to join the US-led effort and Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop to northern Iraq. The Prime Minister also assured that no specific request to step up Australian military involvement in the area had been made and if we were asked the decision would be made under very specific criteria. Mr Abbott (right), alongside Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin (left), said Australian forces had already participated in a humanitarian airdrop . 'Australia will join international partners to help the anti-ISIL forces in Iraq,' Mr Abbott said. 'The situation in Iraq represents a humanitarian catastrophe.' He remains in close contact with the US and other allies. Meanwhile, Greens senators are out outraged by the decision the Abbott government made without the consultation of parliament, The Age reports. Independent Andrew Wilkie is said to have told reporters in Hobart that cabinet should have had an input on the matter. 'If Tony Abbott wants us to be gun runners for the Kurds at the behest of the United States then we are part of the war,' he said, according to the website. Greens leader Christine Milne sided with Mr Wilkie, urging Mr Abbott to put Australia's involvement in Iraq at the top of the list for discussion in parliament on Monday. Australian planes will fly alongside aircraft from Canada, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Prime Minister Tony Abbott responded to the request from the Obama Administration . 'Australia will join international partners to help the anti-ISIL forces in Iraq,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured). An RAAF C-17 Globemaster is will be delivering arms and munitions to Iraq after Australian agreed to requests from the US . The Iraq government and other regional countries will co-ordinate Australia's contribution. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison declined to comment on reports Australia could also be asked to consider deploying . Super Hornets for air strikes. The US had not made that request. 'We're not going to get ahead of ourselves,' he told Sky News. However, the government was looking at Australia's military capability across a range of areas and would consider other . requests. 'Defining the mission and the objective was critical,' Mr Morrison said. 'Let's not kid ourselves either, (IS) does present a threat. What we're seeing there is evil incarnate,' he said. Labor's foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek gave bipartisan support for the weapons drop, saying international . backing for anti-ISIL forces was the 'logical next step'. 'Where you have reasonably effective fighting force ... being the only thing standing between IS and civilian . populations ... at risk of genocide or ethic cleansing, then there is an international . The US has stepped up its strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq this month, and is considering extending air strikes to Syria. Since August 8 the US has conducted more than 80 air strikes, according to Central Command. The wreckage of a vehicle is seen after a US air strike, at Mosul Dam, northern Iraq . US warplanes have hit a wide range of Islamic State militant targets, including artillery, armoured personnel carriers, armoured Humvees, light trucks, mortar positions, checkpoints and roadside bomb emplacements. There's potential for the air campaign to expand into Syria, in which case the US would have to call on aircraft and other elements of its military based in the Middle East and possibly Europe. Australia could also join the US's air campaign, as well as extend its military role in Iraq more generally, as was laid out in Mr Abbott's foreign policy speech at Adelaide University last week, The Australian reported. 'We will do what we reasonably and prudently can to encourage American leadership because that leadership provided global security and stability,' the Prime Minister said. 'We are talking to our partners about how we might contribute to international efforts to protect people against the advances of the ISIS terrorists. 'This is a potential humanitarian disaster,' Mr Abbott said, in reference to the tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - surrounded by Islamic State fighters threatening to kill them. Previously, Australia has been unable to answer US calls for air strike assistance due to concerns about the self-defence capabilities of RAAF aircraft. But The Australian reports that the RAAF now have aircraft suitable for Iraq.

August 2013. 'We . refused to acknowledge any relationship with him in case it was . dangerous for him,' said Avi Hoffman, editor of the Jerusalem Report . The . acknowledgement that Sotloff's religion and Israeli citizenship was kept . secret explains the huge gaps in his public biography that until yesterday went blank . between 2005 and just before his capture as a freelancer. During . his captivity, Sotloff, who was devout, would use his Muslim captors . who were praying towards Mecca to gauge where Jerusalem was for his . daily worship the unidentified fellow captive told the Report. Sotloff also managed to fast on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calender, which occurred in September of 2013. 'He told them he was sick and didn't want to eat,' his friend said.

'I . felt like he really cared about it, he thought it was extremely . important. He was very conscientious, enterprising and brave.' As a freelancer, Sotloff traveled the Arab world and eventually arrived in Syria in August, 2013. The Times of Israel said that they knew he was Jewish, but kept it secret in case his kidnappers found out. Sotloff wrote reports from Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Turkey and Syria. The . Jewish journalist - who held joint American and Israeli citizenship - . spoke fluent Arabic and had a showed a deep love for the Islamic world . before he was captured by ISIS militants in Syria in 2013.

"America's top military general said Tuesday that he is worried the ISIS terror army will soon seize the town of Kobane, a strategically critical Syrian site less than a mile from Turkey. Gen. Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military Joint Chiefs of Staff, said 'I am fearful that Kobane will fall.' Forces fighting for the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham have pressed their way 'into the city itself,' he told ABC News. 'It may be about to fall.' And Dempsey said he has 'no doubt' that ISIS will inflict 'horrific atrocities' on any civilians still in the town 'if they have the opportunity to do so.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said he is 'fearful' that the Syrian town of Kobane will fall to the ISIS terror army . Bad news: Turkey's president, Tayyip Erdogan (above), said on Tuesday that Kobane was 'about to fall' to ISIS,and criticized airstrikes as being insufficient . Fallen: An ISIS flag flew just East of Kobane on Tuesday, in a photo shot than a mile away in Turkey . The U.S. general said his counterparts in Turkey have assured him that they are gearing up to protect their territory if ISIS uses Kobane as a staging ground for an incursion to the north. 'They've got forces on their side of the border that will prevent ISIL from making any incursions into Turkey,' he said, using the Obama administration's preferred alternative name for the genocidal group. 'But, of course,' he predicted, the terror army 'is smart enough not to do that.' ISIS has engaged in a coordinated assault on Kobane for the past three weeks, driving countless Kurdish refugees out and killing an estimated 400-plus Syrian Kurds as it consolidated its gains. If it should manage to take the city, ISIS would control most of the border region in northern Syria. American-led airstrikes, at least a dozen so far according to the Pentagon, have failed to prevent the terror group's advance, and Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that Kobane was 'about to fall.' The prospect that the town could be captured by Islamic . State, who are now within city limits, has increased pressure on . Turkey to join an international coalition to fight against the . jihadists. Turkey is feeling pressure to finally join the international coalition battling ISIS now that the battle is on its doorstep. 'It is our view,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday aboard Air Force One, 'that there is a clear interest that Turkey has in working with the international coalition – or international community – to deal with the threat that's posed by ISIL.' Dempsey said hours later that the U.S. and its allies were finding it more and more difficult to track the increasingly technologically adept ISIS forces. 'They're becoming more savvy with the use of electronic devices,' he said. 'They don't fly flags and move around in large convoys the way they did. ... They don't establish headquarters that are visible or identifiable.' Angry: Protesters take to the streets in Turkey (above) to hold unauthorized demonstrations against the advance of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militants toward central Kobane . Retired Marine Gen. John Allen, President Obama's point man on anti-ISIS coalition building, was dispatched to Ankara on Tuesday to meet with Turkish officials, according to Earnest. The White House, Earnest said, is 'very concerned about the safety of individuals – of citizens, of innocent civilians' in Kobane. 'We are seeing this extremist organization, in the name of an otherwise peaceful religion, Islam, perpetrating terrible acts of violence against religious and ethnic minorities,' Earnest said. 'This is something that we remain concerned about.' Turkey said it was pressing Washington for more airstrikes, . although President  Erdogan said bombings by themselves would not be sufficient to . defeat ISIS. He set out Turkey's demands for . additional measures before his own country would intervene. 'The problem of ISIS ... cannot be solved . via air bombardment,' Erdogan said. 'Right now ... Kobane is about to fall.' 'We had warned the West. We wanted three things. No-fly . zone, a secure zone parallel to that, and the training of . moderate Syrian rebels,' he said. Erdogan claimed Turkey would take action if there were threats to . Turkish soldiers guarding a historic site in Syria that Ankara . regards as its territory. But so far Turkey has made no move to . get involved in fighting across the border. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Turkish Prime . Minister Ahmet Davutoglu have spoken twice in recent days to . discuss the situation, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki . said. 'Turkey is determining what larger role they will play,' she said during a daily briefing. 'They have indicated their openness . to doing that, so there is an active conversation about that.' Get involved: Many want Turkey to join the international coalition trying to stop ISIS as they get closer to the country's border, leading to protests in the country (above) U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said Turkey had been . generous in receiving refugees from Kobane but the international . community needed to protect the town. 'What is needed now is . concrete action,' he said, without elaborating. France said it was vital to stop Islamic State's advance on . Kobane, and was discussing with Turkey what could be done. 'A . tragedy is unfolding, and we must all react,' Foreign Minister . Laurent Fabius told parliament. But some analysts doubt the will exists among Western allies . to take further action. 'It's the coalition of the unwilling, each country is doing . the bare minimum, particularly in Syria,' said Fadi Hakura at . the London-based think tank Chatham House. From across the Turkish border, two Islamic State flags . could be seen flying over the eastern side of Kobani. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group . said it had documented 412 deaths of civilians and fighters . during the three-week battle for Kobane. The U.S. military said it and allied air forces launched . strikes on Islamic State in Syria on Monday and Tuesday. In the . Kobane area the raids destroyed armed vehicles, a tank and a . vehicle carrying anti-aircraft artillery. On the ground, a burning tank, apparently belonging to . Islamic State, could be seen on the western edge of town. There . were also clashes on the northern fringe and mortar explosions . could be heard to the northeast. Laying siege: Footage released by ISIS, above, and posted on social media, reportedly showed how they are in control of a strategic hill on the outskirts of the city of Kobane . Close: Kobane is less than a mile from Turkey . Islamic State fighters were using heavy weapons and shells . to hit Kobane, senior Kurdish official Asya Abdullah told . Reuters from inside the town, estimated by the U.N. on Tuesday . to contain possibly a few hundred remaining residents. Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot, has ramped up its . offensive in recent days against the mainly Kurdish border town, . despite being targeted by U.S.-led coalition air strikes aimed . at halting its progress. 'There were clashes overnight. Not heavy, but ISIS is going . forward from the southwest. They have crossed into Kobane and . control some buildings in the city there,' said Rami . Abdulrahman, head of the Observatory, a group that monitors the . conflict with a network on the ground. ISIS is a former name for . Islamic State. 'They are about 50 meters (55 yards) inside the southwest of . the city,' Abdulrahman said. An estimated 180,000 people have fled into Turkey from the . Kobane region following the Islamic State advance. More than . 2,000 Syrian Kurds including women and children were evacuated . from the town after the latest fighting, a member of the Kurdish . Democratic Union Party (PYD) said on Monday. Before the offensive, Kobane, known as Ayn al-Arab in . Arabic, was home to refugees from the civil war that pits rebels . against President Bashar al-Assad and has deteriorated into . hundreds of localized battles between different factions.","Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen.

Baria is a frequent guest speaker and moderator at international conferences, she has been the President of the IAC (International Arab Charity) since 2004 and is a member of the advisory board of the Tallberg Forum in Sweden.

"A newly-renovated mansion in London's most expensive street could be worth an incredible £200million, estate agents say. The 13-bedroom grade II*-listed house in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London, has been improved to a 'mind-boggling' standard by Britain’s second-richest man, Russian-born tycoon Leonard Blavatnik. The Warner Music Group owner has a 25-metre swimming pool, divided between indoor and outdoor sections, which property experts said is probably unique in central London. The basement has a hot tub, gym, massage . room, cinema and wine cellar. The property is protected by armoured glass and it has a 'multi-storey' underground car park . served by a car lift with room for five vehicles.

Mr Blavatniks paid £41million for 15 (pictured here) and 15b Kensington Palace Gardens in 2004, reportedly outbidding Roman Abramovich and Lakshmi Mittal . According to property experts, the . modernisation means it could be worth as much as £7,000 per sq ft if it . were to come on the market. That would eclipse the Candy Brothers' stunning £6,000 per sq ft apartment block One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge. However, last week it was revealed an end of terrace home in London is . set to become the most expensive property ever sold in the UK after it . went on the market for £250million. The . six-storey Grade I listed Regency mansion is a stone's throw from . Buckingham Palace and boasts 50,000 sq ft of living space, making it one . of the capital’s largest private homes. Last autumn, a huge house at Rutland Gate overlooking Hyde Park was put on sale for £300million, although its price was slashed when it failed to find a buyer. Around the same time, 1 Cornwall Terrace, opposite Regent's Park, was advertised for £100million, which estate agents said was the highest price ever asked for a terraced house.

Giles . Hannah, managing director of Mayfair based VanHan, told the Evening . Standard: 'It is one of the best on the street, with a particularly . large garden and fantastic views overlooking the lawns of Kensington . Palace, where the Duchess of Cambridge will be pushing her pram. 'He’s doing it to a phenomenal standard. It has vast ceiling heights. All the windows have armoured glass.' Eclipsed: The Candy Brothers' £6,000-per-sq-ft apartment block One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge .

'multi-storey' underground car park is served by a car lift with room . for five vehicles. Mr Blavatniks’ wealth has been estimated at  £11billion in the Sunday Times Rich List. He paid £41million for 15 and 15b Kensington Palace Gardens in 2004, reportedly outbidding Roman Abramovich and Lakshmi Mittal. Born Leonid Valentinovich Blavatnik in 1957 in the Soviet Union, he . arrived penniless in the U.S. with his parents at the age of 21 but . immediately took to American entrepreneurial capitalism. After studying . computer science at Columbia University in New York and attending . Harvard Business School, he made an early fortune buying and selling . apartments in Manhattan. In May 2011 he bought Warner Music Group, in a $3.3billion all-cash buyout of the world’s third-largest music company, whose artists include Green Day, Metallica and Bruno Mars. In February, he bought Parlophone Records, the once legendary record label, for £500 million. Parlophone has the likes of Coldplay, Tinie Tempah and Blur on its roster and Blavatnik’s purchase makes him an even stronger power in the music game. He has all of Parlophone and other EMI assets that were put up for sale by Universal after they’d taken over the company. The house, which cost £10,000 to . build in the mid 1850s, served as the Iraqi ambassador’s residence until . 1989, before becoming an annex of the Russian embassy that reputedly . housed intelligence officers. Mr Blavatnik, now a U.S. citizen, has rented 15a over the road while the work has been carried out by French-owned contractors Bouygues UK. It is restoring the main house and turning the garages of the former stable block known as Cope House into a two bedroom 'security post' as, according to planning documents, '24 hour surveillance is needed.' With completion still  several months away, the work has sent a buzz through the property sector. But  it is not yet clear whether Mr Blavatnik will try to find a buyer or simply keep the house as his London pad. One 'fixer' specialising in the top end of the market said: 'The word is that if someone wanted to make an offer at an attractive level, then it would probably be considered seriously. 'I haven’t heard a particular number, but if you price it out per square foot £200 million is about where other super-premium pro-perty prices would suggest it’d be.' Andrew Langton, chairman of Aylesford International who sold Mr Blavatnik the house, said the tycoon would be in no hurry to sell. He said: 'He's banked $8billion this year, he doesn't need to sell anything.'","Russian-born tycoon Leonid Blavatnik bought property in 2004 .

"Humbled: Nicolas Sarkozy leaving the Elysee Palace where he confirmed his decision to retire from politics . A DEVASTATED Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed today that he is to quit politics for good, but added: 'I love life too much to be bitter'. The 57-year-old conservative even said that he wanted people 'to leave me alone' so that he could have a quiet life with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni. Sarkozy said : 'I hope to live a normal life. I lost the election but journalists continue to prevent me from taking a break. 'I'm unable to have lunch with my family. I hope I can now be left to enjoy a bit of quiet.' He made the frank admission after becoming the first French president for 31 years to be rejected after just one term. Sarkozy lost Sunday's nationwide election to his bitter Socialist rival Francois Hollande, soon after opinion polls confirmed Sarkozy's status as the most unpopular head of state in recent history. Today, looking ashen-faced and exhausted, Sarkozy invited his campaign team to the Elysee Palace in Paris and confirmed his decision to retire. During an hour long meeting he said he would not contest a seat for his party, the UMP, at the parliamentary elections in June, saying: 'A page has turned for me. I will not be a legislative candidate now, or in elections to come. 'Rest assured I will renew my party card, and I will pay my dues. But I will quit operations.' Referring to other leaders who have lost elections since the financial crash in 2008, Sarkozy added: 'Of course it would have been better to win, but just look at how others have left office. 'Our failure was not a humiliation, as all the pollsters and the press predicted before Sunday.' Red rising: Scenes of jubilation at Place de la Bastille after socialist candidate Francois Hollande was announced France's new president . Wave of support: Hollande swept to victory on a platform of opposing austerity measures and opposition to international finance setting the political agenda . Urging UMP members to stick together, the 5ft 5ins president said: 'Do not be divided - little chiefs and little teams draws everybody to the bottom'. Sarkozy said the election result was much closer than predicted, saying: 'I told you so. It was almost possible. This proves that I did not lie to you. We were very close.' Sarkozy will officially be president until May 15th, when Hollande takes over following a ceremony at the Elysee Palace. Final farewell: Sarkozy supporters bid their leader adieu . But Sarkozy said: 'If I could, I'd go tomorrow, but there are traditions to follow. I will respect them and the handover will take place with Francois Hollande, as it took place with Jacques Chirac and me.' Hollande's first official job at President-elect will be to commemorate the end of the Second World War at the Arc de Triumphe in central Paris tomorrow. The ceremony will see President Sarkozy join Hollande at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. At the end of his meeting with the party faithful, Sarkozy said : 'We did not quit. I look forward to seeing you again, to talk about the old time.' Sarkozy is a qualified lawyer, but is unlikely to return to practising. His wife is a multi-millionaire heiress, so neither will have any need to go out and earn a living.","Outgoing president insists defeat was 'no humiliation' despite being confirmed as most unpopular French leader in recent history .

"A British ISIS fighter poses gleefully in front of a decapitated soldier strung up and murdered in Syria. Abu Abdullah Al-Habashi, 20, who fled the UK for the Middle East nine months ago,  has 'no sympathy' for the executed man and said  'people love to see heads on spikes'. The Muslim convert is among the hundreds of people who have fled to UK to fight in ISIS and says 'there is no going back'. Posed up: British ISIS fighter Abu Abdullah Al-Habashi, 20, poses in front of a Syrian soldier strung up and decapitated in Syria . Up to 500 British Muslims are believed to be in the region with as many as half joining forces with ISIS, a group known for its extreme violence, including crucifying and beheading its enemies. Justifying the gruesome photo the British citizen originally from Eritrea told BBC's Newsnight: 'People love to see heads on spikes. I feel no sympathy for them because they are all enemies of Allah. 'Isis treats its enemies in the same way they treat us'. According to the BBC he has been based in the in Raqqa, Syria - an Isis stronghold - where many other Britons, including the female 'Terror Twins' from Manchester. Salma and Zahra Halane, who have 28 GCSEs between them, ran away from their family in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, a month ago for 'paradise' in the war torn Middle East. It has also become renowned for the brutal executions, and crucifixions, of ISIS' enemies. Photographs posted on social media of Al-Habashi clutching a machine gun appear to show him across the border in Ramadi, Iraq, where he says he has been on the front line. He said: 'It is the best fighting and the hardest. You are in a city of concrete and everything is blowing up'. Al-Habashi says his family know where he is and have told him: 'Come back - you are crazy'. He has told them: 'This is for the sake of Allah. I'm free. Why would I come back to (go to) prison?'. Face of ISIS: Al-Habashi appeared on a video this weekend where he criticised democracy and demanded Sharia law . Propaganda: In the video a child is shown holding a machine gun with a caption about 'peace and security' Message: The video promoting ISIS and its Caliphate was timed to coincide with Eid . The Muslim convert has  also urged others from the UK to fight in the Middle East and has the become the face of ISIS in its latest recruitment video. Over the weekend a new film was released where he described how wonderful it was to live in the new Islamic Caliphate stretching across Syria and northern Iraq. It features fighters from the UK, Finland and America. He says in a strong British accent: 'You're not living under oppression. You're not living under rule. 'As Muslims, that's what we want and that's what we need. We don't need any democracy, we don't need any communism, we don't need anything like that.'

"When it comes to drinks it's fair to say that Scotland is perhaps better known for beverages such as Irn-Bru or whisky. But a tea-plantation nestled in the foothills of the Scottish Highlands on Dalreoch Farm Estate in Highland Perthshire, has become the largest of its kind in the UK after discovering the perfect recipe for tea. The business is the brainchild of Jamie Russell, 36, Derek Walker, 39, and Tam O'Brann, 44, who set up 'The Wee Tea Company' after meeting in a pop-up shop in Dunfermline. The unlikely business is the brainchild of trio Derek Walker, 39, Tam O'Brann, 44, and Jamie Russell, 36, (L-R) who set up 'The Wee Tea Company' They company say they benefit from the mountain air and fresh spring water unique to Scotland and are already farming over 2,000 tea plants . The plantation nestled in the foothills of the Scottish Highlands, Dalreoch, in Highland Perthshire . The trio behind the company insist there is no reason why they can't grow the same crops more commonly found in the planet's most humid climates. The award-winning team say they benefit . from the mountain air and fresh spring water unique to Scotland and are . already farming over 2,000 tea plants to make a flawless cuppa. The tea is grown at 230 metres above sea level and the team hopes to be operating to full capacity within two years. They plan to cultivate more than 14,000 individual plants, making the chilly district Europe's biggest tea grower. A spokesman for the company said: 'The plants we are growing will produce leaves for 30-90 years. With the right technology and a bit of common sense growing tea in Scotland is possible. 'There is nothing to stop people growing their own tea plants, it's just about getting the conditions right. 'By growing plants at the foot of the Scottish Highlands camellia sinensis benefit from the clean mountain air, altitude and fresh spring water unique to Scotland. 'We also utilise cutting edge agronomy techniques from Australasia, the Americas and Scandinavia. The Wee Tea Company will be competing with the world's main tea-growing regions, India, China, Japan and Taiwan, but with over 165 million cups of tea drank every day in Britain alone, the market is hardly saturated.

'And despite the harsh winter period above the border, the trio insist there is no reason why they can't grow the same crops more commonly found in the planet's most humid climates. The spokesman said: 'Protecting against high winds or frost, development of the plants root system and maximising the known seasons of high growth are key to our success in these beautiful surroundings. 'We don't use petrochemical-based pesticide meaning airborne insects are discouraged from planting eggs on our crops through reflected sunlight. 'Using degradable polymers around the plant, we reflect the sun's own goodness upwards, doubling the effect of Scottish sunshine but also reducing the shade these critters prefer. 'The same degradable membrane traps the heat already within our soil and heightens humidity while reducing the need for any secondary watering. 'For water we draw our own mountain spring and reservoir reserves for any unduly dry spells. 'All in all we're using the best of what Scotland has to offer.'

"AC Milan's search for a striker is dominating the front pages of the Italian papers, with Roma's Mattia Destro top of Filippo Inzaghi's wanted list. Tuttosport lead with the headline 'The war of the goals' listing the potential candidates the club are looking at to lead the line in the second half of their season. Milan are 11th in Serie A and in desperate need of a goalscorer after an injury to Stephan El Sharaawy left them desperately short. Tuttosport lead with AC Milan's search for a striker to help their disastrous Serie A season get on track . Tuttosport list Destro (Roma), Dani Osvaldo (Inter Milan, on loan from Southampton), Simone Zaza (Sassuolo), Sebastian Giovinco (who is now unavailable after signing for Toronto from Juventus), Giampaolo Pazzini (currently at the club) and Stefano Okaka (Sampdoria) as the potential strikers to take the mantle at Milan. Destro though, has also been linked with a move to the Premier League. Reports have stated that Tottenham are in talks with Roma regarding a swap deal including defender Vlad Chiriches, while their north London rivals Arsenal are also said to be in the chase.

"The echo in the oil tank at Inchindown lasts a world-record 75 seconds . An oil tank in the Scottish Highlands has earned a place in the record books after producing the world's longest echo. Lasting an incredible 75 seconds, the reverberation smashed the previous record - also set in Scotland more than 40 years ago - by more than a minute. It was recorded by an acoustics expert in a tank measuring twice the length of a football pitch, which was 30ft wide and more than 44ft high. The discovery was made by Professor Trevor Cox when he climbed into the tank at Inchindown, near Invergordon, and started singing and shouting. 'I was like a toddler sitting at a piano for the first time, thrashing the ivories to see what sounds would come out,' he said. 'Reluctantly, after a few minutes I stopped playing with the acoustics and started preparing for my measurements.' For the record, the RCAHMS' archaeological investigator Allan Kilpatrick, working with Professor Cox, shot a pistol with blanks about a third of the way down the 80-year-old tank. Standing a third of the way from the other end, Professor Cox, of Salford University, recorded the sounds with microphones. Scroll down for video . Professor Trevor Cox (pictured) measured the world's longest echo in an oil tank in the Scottish Highlands . Professor Cox said he initially felt 'disbelief' over the length of the sound. Describing the noise, he said: 'If the world ends with an apocalyptic thunder crack, this is what it will sound like, with the rumble lingering and forlornly dying away. 'I wanted to shout with astonishment, but I had to remain silent so as not to ruin the recording.' The 75-second reverberation puts to shame the previous world record – held by Hamilton Mausoleum, South Lanarkshire, also in Scotland – which managed 15 seconds. The 75-second reverberation was recorded in Inchindown by Professor Trevor Cox of Salford University . The reverberation of the mausoleum chapel was caused by slamming one of the main brass doors shut in 1970. Professor Cox wrote about his record-breaking recording in his new book, Sonic Wonderland: A Scientific Odyssey Of Sound.","The echo smashes the previous world record - also set in Scotland - which lasted 15 seconds and was recorded in 1970 .

"Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva admits it would be a 'dream' to return to Wembley this season, though he has had thoughts about leaving the club. The Brazilian midfielder was a target of Inter Milan this January, although no official bid materialised. Brendan Rodgers, having restored Lucas to the team after a spell on the sidelines, maintained he did not want to lose a player who, in his youth, won the Bola de Ouro, Brazil’s Player of the Year award. Lucas Leiva hasn't committed his future to Liverpool but says it will be special to get to Wembley . Lucas has been reinstated into the Liverpool team but was linked with Inter Milan this month . That did not stop Lucas thinking of a move elsewhere, though. ‘I just have to focus on what I can control and see what happens,’ he said. ‘I would be lying if I said I never thought about something new but I can’t tell you what is going to happen. I just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself.’ Standing in Lucas' and Liverpool's way on Tuesday night are Chelsea, who are the favourites to progress to the Capital One Cup final after the 1-1 draw in the first leg at Anfield. He added: ‘Of course Chelsea will always be in the way of what we want to achieve because they are a big club. ‘They are the same as Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City. When you get towards finals, you have to play them. Hopefully this time it will go our way.’ The Brazilian midfielder says it would be a dream to join Steven Gerrard in the Capital One Cup final .

This time he wants to experience it for real. ‘It was hard for me,’ said Lucas. ‘When we were on our way to the stadium of course I was a bit down because I wanted to be part of it on the pitch and I remember Stevie Gerrard sending me a text which said, “Don’t worry, we will get here again”. 'It is something I always remember and hopefully we will make that come true. That would be special.’","Liverpool travel to play Chelsea in a Capital One Cup semi-final second leg .

"Arsene Wenger has addressed Arsenal's defensive frailties this season by signing Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista for an initial fee of £11.2million. The Brazilian centre-back had helped  Villarreal towards the second best defensive record in La Liga  and will be a welcome addition at the Emirates where the Gunners' backline has been depleted by injuries this term. The 24-year-old has already been granted a UK work permit and is expected to complete his move on Monday, but who is Paulista and is he the answer to Arsenal's defensive woes? Gabriel Paulista (left) is expected to complete his move from Villarreal to the Emirates on Monday . Gunners fans will hope Paulista can shore up a defence that has been depleted by injuries this season . Arsene Wenger has identified Paulista as  his main transfer target in the January transfer window . Arsenal’s new signing Gabriel or Paulista? Gabriel to Villarreal fans. And that’s likely to be his footballing name in London too. How long has he been in Europe? He signed for Villarreal in the summer of 2013 from Brazilian side Vitoria. Villarreal were debating between signing Barcelona central defender Marc Bartra and 22-year-old Gabriel and they opted for the boy from Brazil. Paulista has starred for Villarreal this season but will need time to adapt to the pace of the Premier League . Paulista embraces Villarreal captain Bruno Soriano after being presented with a farewell gift . And they chose well? He was a reliable reserve at first but injuries to first choice centre-backs Mateo Musacchio and Victor Ruiz gave him his chance and he took it. This season he had been near ever-present and a consistent performer in the team with the second best defensive record in the division. It’s fair to say, however, that the jump from Spain to the Premier League will be even more testing than the one from Brazil to La Liga. Where might he be found wanting? He’s less than two years out of Brazil and still a little raw. Arsene Wenger is buying huge potential but not the finished article. Learning your trade in Brazil and then playing in La Liga might also not serve as the greatest apprenticeship for the Premier League where many of the teams he faces will be far more direct than he has been used to. But he is 6ft 1in and competent in the air and it’s also true that he bring a lot of other strengths to the table. Arsene Wenger will be pleased that the  24-year-old has an impressive fitness record . And they are? He will give the team excellent distribution out of defence. Displays confidence and maturity on the ball. He is also quick, strong and aggressive. And, perhaps of extra importance to Arsenal in view of their record – Gabriel’s fitness record is very good – barely missed a game since arriving from Brazil. And he’ll be missed at El Madrigal? They have reasonable back-up in Musacchio and Ruiz and will buy before the window shuts but yes Gabriel had emerged as the best of the three central defenders at the club this season. They are used to seeing their best players leave and Joel Campbell’s arrival softens the blow but coach Marcelino admitted it was ‘inopportune’. Paulista was brought to tears as he said his final goodbyes to fans at El Madrigal . From his tears it looks as if Gabriel will miss Villarreal . He was very settled on Spain’s east coast. The move was also something of a surprise. But we’ve seen goodbye tears from Alberto Moreno before joining Liverpool and a watery eye from Adrian when he left Betis to join West Ham. Gabriel will settle quickly; he knows this is his big chance. And he’ll have a friend at the Emirates before a ball is kicked. Santi Cazorla knows all about swapping Villarreal for the Premier League albeit in his case via Malaga.","Arsenal are on the verge of signing Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista .

"Gabriel Paulista has been granted a UK work permit, clearing the path for him to complete an £11.2million switch to Arsenal. The Villarreal defender is completing his medical and provided the procedure doesn't flag up any issues, the 24-year-old will seal his move to the Emirates on Monday. There were fears that Paulista would be denied a work permit due to the fact he has not played international football. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been keen on a move to bring Gabriel Paulista to the club from Villarreal . The Brazilian defender will be looking to bolster Arsenal's defensive ranks when the move goes through . However, the application for the Brazilian has been approved and he is now virtually certain to complete his switch from Spain. Speaking about the move on Sunday, Wenger said: 'The deal is on the line and should move over the line overnight.' Paulista is expected to join the club imminently with Joel Campbell joining the La Liga side on loan for the remainder of the season as part of the agreement.

"A pair of shop workers stole a whole day's taking and lost it all in a casino when they put more than £3,000 on red. Kieron Trott and Christopher Cameron said they just wanted to see what it would feel like to gamble so much money at once - but were forced to quit their jobs at Poundstretcher after the bet went sour. The crime was so foolish that even the men's lawyers appeared to mock them in court - one said it was a 'miracle' that his client had managed to get another job. Workplace: Two Poundstretcher employees stole their day's takings and lost it in a casino . Trott, 19, and Cameron, 48, worked together at a branch of Poundstretcher in a Sunderland retail park. On October 13 last year, their manager left them in the shop at the end of her shift - along with the day's takings of £3,380. On the spur of the moment, the two men decided to go to a nearby casino where they gambled - and lost - the whole amount instantly. Lee Poppett, prosecuting, branded the offence 'somewhat unusual'. He said: 'At 9pm [the manager] received a call from Mr Trott stating that she needed to come back to the store because they had gambled away the takings. 'She believed it was a form of joke, but Mr Trott said, ""I'm not joking, call the police."" 'She could hear Mr Cameron in the background saying, ""He is being honest, you have to come back to the store.""' Convicted: The two men pleaded guilty to theft at Sunderland Magistrates' Court, pictured . The pair resigned immediately, and are now trying to repay the money they took. They pleaded guilty to theft by an employee when they appeared at Sunderland Magistrates' Court. Trott and Cameron, who are both from Sunderland, were handed 12-month community orders and were told to pay £110 each in costs and surcharges. Trott was told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work, while Cameron will have to do 66 hours. Ian Cassidy, defending Cameron, said, the situation was 'almost like something out of a comedy' and that his client has never even been to a casino before. 'Mr Cameron was working his regular shift. It was just the two of them and part of the routine is to check the cash that has been taken that day. 'They are joking, saying what would it be like if we took this money and gambled it. Unbelievably, they persuaded themselves to do this. 'He can't quite believe it. He described being in the casino a matter of minutes. 'They were seen transferring the cash into chips then go to the table saying ""red?"" and ""yes"". Lo and behold it came up on black.' Jason Smith, defending Trott, said: 'It was an act of gross stupidity. They were saying, ""Let's go and do this, we might make some money out of it."" How that would work is beyond me. 'He is paying the money back at a rate of £50 a week because, miraculously, he's managed to find work at Nissan.'","Kieron Trott and Christopher Cameron were handling £3,380 in takings .

"David Cameron has been accused of breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, under which veterans must receive priority NHS treatment . Ministers are failing to honour a pledge to Britain’s wounded war heroes who face a healthcare ‘postcode lottery’, it has been claimed. In a devastating assessment, medical experts, MPs, soldiers and military charities have revealed that troops who suffered on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan are being badly let down. In the past five years, around 51,300 service personnel – some still in their teens – have been categorised as injured, wounded or sick. Some will require constant care their whole lives. Under the Armed Forces Covenant, enshrined in law by David Cameron three years ago, veterans must receive priority NHS treatment for injuries suffered in the line of duty. But experts have come forward to point out that many are not being placed at the front of waiting lists – meaning the Government is failing to fulfil its pledge. Professor Neil Greenberg, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘The Government needs to be a bit more honest about what it is delivering and what it says it’s delivering, because the two are definitely not the same.’ Orthopaedic surgeon Professor Tim Briggs said: ‘We can do better and we should do better. Veterans weren’t aware of the Covenant. Finding access to specialist care was proving difficult, some were falling through the net.’ And Royal British Legion director-general Chris Simpkins said the £150,000 spent annually by each of ten specialist NHS mental health centres for ex-soldiers in England was ‘not enough to shield veterans from the extreme postcode lottery of variable waiting times for treatment’. Corporal Simon Brown, who served in the Army for more than ten years, was medically discharged after being shot in the face by a sniper in Iraq in 2006. He still has not had the surgery and treatment he requires. Condemning the ‘flawed’ system, he said: ’It has been long processes – there’s been a lot of jumping through hoops. I actually had to see a committee to see whether or not I was entitled to free plastic surgery.’ A separate report written by the Commons Defence Select Committee and published yesterday said that ‘more resources’ would need to be injected into supporting the physically and psychologically wounded. The cross-party panel of MPs found soldiers deployed in combat roles suffered twice the usual rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and one in five of all troops experience some kind of mental disorder. Committee chairman Rory Stewart, a Conservative MP, said: ‘British society has a unique debt of gratitude and an obligation to look after the citizens who have risked their lives for their country.’ An MoD spokesman insisted that the Government has ‘worked hard to ensure that our serving personnel, veterans and families have the support they need and are treated with the dignity they deserve’.","Veterans must receive priority treatment for injuries suffered in active duty .

"War widows who choose to remarry will no longer lose their pensions, the Prime Minister has announced today. For decades the wives of fallen servicemen have had to choose between finding new love and financial stability under a complex scheme  introduced in 1975 that stopped the pensions of military widows who remarried or cohabited with someone after the death of their spouse. This morning David Cameron abolished the 'absolutely wrong' loophole before joining the Military Wives Choir in central London on the eve of Remembrance Sunday. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister this morning scrapped the rules which he described as 'absolutely wrong', allowing thousands of widows who remarry to claim military pensions following in the future . It comes as campaigners threatened to walk down Downing Street today in what would have been an embarrassing prelude to tomorrow's services. Speaking of the change, Mr Cameron: 'This is a long-standing grievance and I think one which is very justified - people who were married to someone in the armed services and that person died and so they lost their pension if they married again. 'I think that wasn't fair and I'm delighted that because we have a strong economy we can afford to make this change and give justice to these people. He added: 'This reflects our clear commitment to uphold the Armed Forces Covenant which we enshrined in law.' Previously, he described the rules as 'absolutely wrong', adding they forced widows into an 'agonising choice between loneliness and financial security', the Times reports. Mr Cameron was joined by members of the War Widows' Association at No 10  to announce the change . The Military Wives Choir today performed in central London as the weekend's remembrance events began . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'It’s vital that we do right by those who put their lives on the line for their country - that’s why this Government enshrined the Armed Forces Covenant in law.' The move was welcomed by the War Widows' Association, representatives of which joined Mr Cameron at No 10 this morning. Irene Wills, chairman of the Association, said: 'We're delighted that Mr Cameron and Mr Fallon have been courageous enough to correct this injustice. 'After campaigning for this amendment, which will benefit a small number of war widows whose partners died in service to their country, we are delighted that the Government has decided to provide pensions for life. 'It is absolutely wrong that some Armed Forces widows lose their pension if they choose to remarry.' Others highlighted the plight of military spouses who, they said, were often prevented from earning a pension themselves by having to move across the country at the request of the forces. 'As the spouse of a member of the British Armed Forces your career can take a back seat as a result of relocation and frequent moves, therefore many miss out on the chance to build up an independent pension pot,' Chris Simpkins, director general of the Royal British Legion said. War widows today welcomed the change in the rules for which they had long been campaigning . 'The Armed Forces Covenant recognises that no one should suffer a disadvantage due to Service, and that the bereaved are entitled to special consideration. 'That is why today's announcement, that all widows and widowers will retain their pension for life, is so important. 'We congratulate the Government on recognising that this is a Covenant issue and enabling Armed Forces widows and widowers to live on.' The change comes after years of campaigning by the Association to secure pensions for around 4,000 widows deprived of stately income once remarried. While anyone whose military spouse died after April 5 2005 or before 31 March 1973 is allowed to keep their pension, thousands in between would have to go without under the previous rules. The new rules will come into effect on April 5 2015, meaning anyone war widows or widowers who remarry after that date will still be eligible to claim military pensions. Widows or widowers who are already remarried or plan to marry before that date will not be able to reclaim money they would have been entitled to under the new rules, however. While the change has been widely welcomed, campaigners are calling for the same rules to now apply to widows of police and emergency service workers. COPS (Care of Police Survivors), the charity which supports the families of police officers killed as a result of their job, has launched an online campaign to be considered by the Government. This morning the Prime Minister joined the Military Wives Choir in central London in the first of his engagements to commemorate the war dead this weekend. Later he is expected to attend the Royal Legion's Festival of Remembrance at Royal Albert Hall.","David Cameron scrapped 'absolutely wrong' loophole in pension scheme .

"A wife-killing double rapist has been caught begging and claiming to be homeless, despite being given a free council flat after his release from prison. Stuart Durkin, branded a 'beast' by a judge, begs on the streets of London even though he lives in a £400,000 taxpayer-funded flat and claims benefits. Durkin lives in trendy St John's Wood, north London, and claims £70 incapacity benefit a week, raking in £25,480 over the last seven years after breaking his hip in 2008. Wife-killing double rapist Stuart Durkin begs on the streets of London and claims to be homeless despite living in a taxpayer-funded £400,000 flat in north London . He was caught pestering people for change outside a Tesco near Paddington Station, telling the Sun on Sunday that he was made homeless when his girlfriend left him. He said: 'I've got a sofa to stay on sometimes but I need money for food. I can't get any benefits.' However, back at his one-bedroom flat, which could be rented privately for up to £1,500 a month, Durkin admitted he had a roof over his head in an area where around 4,400 families are waiting for social housing. The 53-year-old, originally from Leeds, still complained: 'It's a wreck. There was a flood two years ago and the council still hasn't redecorated.' Durkin was jailed in 1984 for the manslaughter of his Swedish wife, receiving a six-year sentence. But he was back in the UK by 1988, when he was jailed for 12 years for breaking into a bedsit and raping a woman. Durkin, 53, lives in a flat in this building in St John's Wood, north London, but still claims he is homeless . Durkin, pictured poking his head out of his window, was jailed for the manslaughter of his wife in the 1980s and went on to rape two other women . After serving half of his sentence, Durkin was released and he moved to Rome, where he became known as 'The King' among fellow beggars. He was jailed once again for the rape and attempted murder of a German tourist to the Italian city, but was extradited to the UK in 2004 to serve the remainder of his sentence. Durkin was freed in 2007, when he was given the free council flat. The serial criminal was back in court again in 2012 after having sex with unsuspecting women at the Occupy London camp at Finsbury Park, north London. He was jailed for 24 weeks after admitting failing to comply with sex offender notification requirements. At the Old Bailey sentencing, Recorder Nigel Peters QC said: 'What's clear is that you are someone who has a history of violent offences and sexual offences and are clearly somebody who is considered at the highest risk end of involvement in offences involving sexual matters and violence.'","Stuart Durkin begs and claims to be homeless but lives in free council flat .

"Shelling by pro-Russian rebels has killed at least 30 people, and injured 83, in Mariupol - a single day after the separatists rejected a peace deal signed last year. 'Indiscriminate rocket fire' from long range GRAD Missiles struck a market, two schools, homes and shops according to the regional police force. The rocket fire had come from rebel-held territory, the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe said this evening, as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to stop supplying arms tot he separatists. 'Russian troops in eastern Ukraine are supporting these offensive operations with command and control systems, air defence systems with advanced surface-to-air missiles, unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced multiple rocket launcher systems and electronic warfare systems,' he said. 'I strongly urge Russia to stop its military, political and financial support for the separatists, stop destabilising Ukraine and respect its international commitments.' Destroyed: A car burns on the street after a shelling by pro-Russian rebels of a residential area of Mariupol, in eastern Ukraine . A pro-Russian rebel holds a Ukrainian flag found in a check-point captured by pro-Russian rebels, at the town of Krasniy Partizan . Senseless: Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk has condemned the bombing as a deliberate attack on peaceful citizens . Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has cut his visit to Saudi Arabia short to call an emergency meeting of his military officials, to coordinate the government's response. The country's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk has condemned the bombing as a 'deliberate attack on peaceful citizens' and laid the overall blame on Russia's doorstep. He said: 'The world needs to stop the Russian aggressor threatening Ukraine, Europe and global security. 'The problem is in the hero-town of Moscow, the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin.' A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks, said they started in the early morning. Leonid Vasilenko, who lives in the eastern suburbs of Mariupol, said: 'The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house. 'I hid in the basement. What else can you do? I took the dog and the cat. In the basement you could hear the earth tremble.' Incinerated: Cars, buildings and homes in Mariupol (pictured) were destroyed in the shelling attack . Deceased: The two bodies pictured in this residential area in Mariupol are among 23 who lost their lives . Terrified: A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks said he could 'hear the earth tremble' from the basement where he was hiding . Revenge: It is thought today's attack in Mariupol (pictured) was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday . A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks, said they started in the early morning. Leonid Vasilenko, who lives in the eastern suburbs of Mariupol, said: 'The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house. 'I hid in the basement. What else can you do? I took the dog and the cat. In the basement you could hear the earth tremble.' Mariupol mayor Yuriy Khotlubei said: 'The area that came under attack was massive. 'The shelling was carried out by militants. This is very clearly Russian aggression that has caused terrible losses for the residents of the eastern part of our city.' Despite international calls for a ceasefire, the separatists' leader Alexander Zakharchenko has vowed to push on with a new offensive and expel Ukrainian troops from the eastern region entirely. It is thought today's attack was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday. He said the insurgents would take no further part in peace talks, adding: 'Today an offensive was launched on Mariupol. This will be the best possible monument to all our dead. 'Attempts to talk about a cease-fire will no longer be undertaken by our side.' At a defence meeting in Kiev, Ukraine's defence minister Stepan Poltorak said there had been a serious escalation in fighting on the front-lines in the last 24 hours. 'Starting from Luhansk region and ending in Mariupol, everywhere illegal armed groups together with Russian units are going on the offensive,' he said.

Destruction: The shelling by pro-Russian rebels killed 20 people in the city of Mariupol, Ukraine (pictured) No compromise: The deadly attack comes just one day after separatists rejected a peace deal brokered to hinder the fighting . 'Strategically important': The coastal city of Mariupol lies on the Azov sea, between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula . The rebels' new multi-pronged offensive against the country's troops has seriously hindered recent attempts to mediate an end to the fighting. Government-controlled Mariupol occupies a strategically important position on the Sea of Azov, on a coastal route from the Russian border to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine last March. Fierce fighting since the peace deal was signed in Minsk in September has heightened fears the rebel forces would try to establish a land link between Russia and Crimea. They currently have positions around six miles from Mariupol's eastern outskirts. The agreement signed in the Belarusian capital tried to instigate a cease-fire and the removal all of heavy weapons from certain areas in eastern Ukraine. But it has been repeatedly violated by both sides - and heavy artillery and rocket barrages have increased the civilian death toll in the last few weeks. On Thursday, mortar shells rained down on rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine - killing 13 people at a bus stop. The separatists retaliated both swiftly and brutally by parading captured Ukrainian troops through the city as enraged residents kicked and shouted abuse at them. Surrounded: Rebel forces currently have positions six miles outside the city of Mariupol, which they bombed this morning . Cut off: Emergency workers inspected a damaged bridge on January 21, following an overnight blast which severed the railway link between Mariupol and Ukraine's west . And last weekend, battles intensified over Donetsk airport, which has been reduced to rubble after months of fighting. Rebels eventually took control of the terminal and fighting has continued on its fringes since. Last week, Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko claimed there were 9,000 Russian troops inside his country and called on Moscow to withdraw them - blaming it for an armed aggression. Moscow denies sending soldiers and weapons to east Ukraine, despite what the West deems 'irrefutable proof'. Zakharchenko, who claims rebel fighters were advancing in three directions in Donetsk, said: 'We will hit them until we reach the border of Donetsk region, and if I see the danger for Donetsk from any other city, I will destroy this threat there.' On Wednesday, foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany agreed to revive a division line between separatists and Ukraine's troops, but fighting has continued unabated. The tentative peace deal forged in Berlin  called on both Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed rebels to pull their heavy arms nine miles on either side of the division line - although there was no agreement reached on a withdrawal of troops. Retaliation: The attack in Mariupol comes just two days after a grenade explosion at a bus stop in the rebel-held area of Donetsk killed 13 people . Fury: The leader of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zakharchenko (left) said: 'Attempts to talk about a cease-fire will no longer be undertaken by our side' Death: At least 13 people were killed, and many were injured, in the bus attack in Donetsk - just hours after peace talks in Berlin called for a cease fire . Offensive: Zakharchenko has said pro-Russian rebels (pictured) are advancing in three directions in Donetsk, in a bid to claim the city entirely . But rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin threw the agreement into doubt by saying the insurgents 'will no longer consider the Minsk agreement in the form it was signed'. Basurin's bold statement contradicted the official position of Russia, which has repeatedly pledged respect for the Minsk agreement, which also requested the withdrawal of foreign fighters and the monitoring of the Russian-Ukrainian border by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The UN human rights agency has estimated that 5,100 people have been killed as a result of the conflict since April last year.","Buildings destroyed by missiles in  'strategically important' city of Mariupol .

"Heartless: Cynthia Anderson, 56 (pictured), was arrested on Friday after allegedly drowning a 3-week-old puppy at the Central Nebraska Regional Airport . A woman was arrested in Nebraska last week after allegedly drowning her 3-week-old puppy in an airport bathroom when she tried and failed several times to sneak the young doberman on her plane. Cynthia Anderson, 56, was arrested on Friday and charged with with a felony count of animal cruelty. Police say the Edgewater, Florida resident tried to board a flight out of Central Nebraska Regional Airport on Thursday with two small dogs in crates and three young puppies. Following U.S. flight regulations, workers at the airport barred Anderson from boarding her flight because dogs younger than eight weeks old are not allowed to fly. 'Their eyes weren't even open,' said Grand Island Police Captain Dean Elliott. Anderson allegedly handed off two of the puppies to her parents who live in western Nebraska, and tried to board a flight the next day with the two older dogs in cages and the remaining puppy which she tried to hide in her carry-on bag. It was when airport security caught her trying to smuggle the dog again that Anderson allegedly drowned the puppy in a bathroom. Anderson was arrested after police interviewed  'numerous witnesses' - including the woman who discovered the dead dog in the bathroom. Smuggler: Police say Anderson tried to smuggle the doberman puppy onto a flight at the small regional airport three times before she resorted to killing the dog . The rules: According to U.S. regulations, dogs younger than eight weeks old are not allowed to fly on planes. Anderson pictured above in photos posted to Facebook . An autopsy on the puppy was conducted at the Humane Society, and water was found in one of the dog's lungs. Anderson's two older dogs are now in the care of her parents, while the other two puppies are at the Humane Society. She remains in Hall County Jail on the felony charge. According to a report in the Orlando Sentinel, Anderson has a criminal record that dates back to 2010 when she was arrested and fined for stealing from a store. Over the next few years, she racked up other robbery-related charges and in 2011 was sentenced to six months of probation for grand theft. She has also been arrested for writing a bad check and last year was collared for charges of batter and trespassing in an occupied structure. Those charges landed her another six months of probation.","Cynthia Anderson, 56, tried to smuggle the young doberman on the plane three times before she allegedly killed the dog .

"John Boye and Andre Ayew scored as Ghana came from behind to defeat South Africa 2-1 and seal their progress to the quarter-finals of the African Nations Cup.

Ghana's profligacy came back to haunt them as Ephraim Mashaba's men took the lead in sensational style in the 17th minute.

"It may not be long before we see his arms wiggling in celebration again. Daniel Sturridge is on the cusp of a return for Liverpool. Usually that means goals. Brendan Rodgers is understandably thrilled about the return from injury of his 25-year-old striker, who has travelled to London with the squad for Tuesday night’s Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea. The Liverpool manager is yet to reveal whether Sturridge is fit enough for a place on the bench, but if selected in the squad expect him to play some part. Either way, the match against West Ham on Saturday will definitely see his presence, Rodgers has said. Daniel Sturridge is back in training after recovering from long-term thigh and calf injuries . Brendan Rodgers (centre) hopes the striker's return can push Liverpool towards a Champions League finish . The England striker speaks with captain Steven Gerrard (right) during the training session . Sturridge(left)  could return for the Capital One Cup showdown with Chelsea after sitting out the first leg . It is difficult to underestimate the impact he might have – even after nearly five months out with thigh and calf injuries. This, after all, is a player whose goals earned Liverpool more points last season than the strikes of Luis Suarez. Sturridge scored 21 times in the Premier League to secure his team 20 points. Suarez found the net on 31 occasions to directly gain 16 points. Those two stand top of last season’s table highlighting that measurement. Romelu Lukaku’s 15 Everton goals affected 12 points, Olivier Giroud’s 16 goals did likewise for Arsenal, while Eden Hazard scored 14 times to win Chelsea 10 points. It really was a phenomenal contribution by Sturridge. Even this season, his solitary goal earned victory against Southampton: two extra points. Sturridge's goals earned more points (20) than his Liverpool strike partner Luis Suarez (16) last season . Sturridge also earned his team more points than (L-R) Romelu Lukaku, Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard . Liverpool fans are excited, certainly, but also a little anxious. We have had false dawns before with Sturridge, who was in training on Sunday. He has not appeared for his club since August 31 in the 3-0 win at Tottenham. Roy Hodgson played him for 89 minutes of England’s friendly win over Norway three days later then had him in the training session which saw Sturridge suffer a thigh strain originally expected to keep him out for three weeks. Rodgers and Hodgson traded words over the circumstances of that training session and Sturridge’s problems but whatever the root cause, he is only now ready to make a come back – and not before time. Since he was initially ruled out Liverpool have stuttered, Rodgers has come under greater scrutiny than before, and Steven Gerrard has announced his departure from the club. Sturridge has been sidelined for nearly five months after initially picking up a thigh injury on England duty . Sturridge has not played since Liverpool beat Tottenham 3-0 away on August 31 . Liverpool’s Champions League campaign was utterly underwhelming and the lethargic style of play, coming after last season’s swashbuckling approach, drew serious concern. Liverpool’s season has shown flickers of life recently, though. Unbeaten in 10 matches since defeat at Manchester United, Tuesday night’s match at Stamford Bridge could provide a platform for the first silverware of the season. Sturridge’s return may even provide a psychological lift from the sidelines. In the table, Liverpool are five points adrift of the Champions League places, remarkable given their look of desperation at stages and largely down to lacklustre performances by teams above. Could Sturridge provide the kickstart to ensure this season ends with a positive charge? Liverpool earned an average of 2.2 points a game with Sturridge playing last season, but only 1.7 points without him in the side . The 25-year-old performs his trademark goal celebration during a pre-season friendly with Borussia Dortmund . The statistics suggest so. In the 32 Premier League games Sturridge has played since the start of last season, Liverpool have won 68.80 per cent, averaging 2.2 points per game, losing just four. In the same period Liverpool have won just 50 per cent of their 28 games without Sturridge, averaging 1.7 points per game and losing nine times. When Sturridge plays Liverpool score considerably more – 2.6 goals per game compared to 1.8 without him. Clearly, this data is boosted by the Uruguayan who headed to Barcelona last summer, but Sturridge more than played his part and will add a clinical element to Liverpool’s game. Too often, with Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert faltering, this has been lacking. Raheem Sterling shouldered that responsibility before and since his mid-season break – and while his centre-forward role is an interesting development (realised fully in that moment he tore Chelsea’s defence apart to score at Anfield) you sense a deeper position would prove more damaging to opponents. Raheem Sterling, scoring against Chelsea, has taken over striker responsibilities in Sturridge's absence . (L-R) Fabio Borini, Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli have not weighed in with the goals . With Suarez gone, Sturridge injured, and Gerrard heading into the Los Angeles sunset, Sterling has been a lightening rod for Liverpool’s expectations. That is some responsibility. Sturridge returning should remove some of that mental pressure and also allow the 20-year-old to operate in his natural place on the pitch. Imagine Sterling picking up the ball consistently from advanced midfield and running at defenders – as he did when dropping deep in the first leg of this semi-final. Sterling and Sturridge are on the same wavelength, quick feet and quick brains, and goals should flow. A new SAS in the making? With a fight on four fronts still, Rodgers will hope so.","Daniel Sturridge has been out for nearly five months through injury .

"Former Newcastle United striker Micky Quinn insists the club are doomed under owner Mike Ashley - as he is only interested in making money. On Monday it was revealed that John Carver would be remaining in caretaker charge of Newcastle until the end of the season - a move Quinn says highlights the distinct lack of ambition at the club. Speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show Quinn said: 'It wasn't a surprise was it? (Carver getting the caretaker job until May). It is the cheaper option for the club. Micky Quinn, who works as a radio pundit on talkSport, believes the club is rotting away under Mike Ashley . Quinn scored 59 league goals in 115 appearances for the Magpies between 1989 and 1992 . 'There is just no ambition and while Ashley is there the soul of the club is rotting away slowly. He is only interested in making money. 'There has been no improvement in the team since John took over. 'He might just show people what he is made of, but the jury is out as far as I am concerned. Is he good enough for Newcastle? 'Based on the last five games, no, he is not good enough. Quinn sees a bleak future for Newcastle under the ownership of owner Ashley .

"Paris Saint-Germain have had a new offer for Adnan Januzaj rejected, the Manchester United attacker's agent has claimed. Januzaj has been used sparingly at Old Trafford this season by Louis van Gaal, despite becoming a rare bright spark for the Dutchman's predecessor, David Moyes. The Belgian international has found opportunities in the first team hard to come by after Angel di Maria signed from Real Madrid. Adnan Januzaj (right) pictured in action for Manchester United against Cambridge in the FA Cup . Januzaj (right) enjoyed a superb season last year at United but has not been used as often this year . And the 19-year-old attacking playmaker has  been repeatedly linked with French champions PSG, who are languishing in third place in Ligue 1 this season and trail leaders Lyon by four points. 'PSG have shown themselves to be interested this winter,' Januzaj's representative Dirk de Vriese told Foot Mercato in France. 'They directly contacted Manchester United for information. Van Gaal announced that he (Januzaj) cannot leave this winter. Not as a permanent transfer nor as a loan. 'The coach considered him as an important player for (the) squad. He is counting on everyone. It seems like a definitive decision, I don’t think that it can change.' PSG's manager, the former United defender Laurent Blanc, is a long term admirer of Januzaj's talents. They had a bid for him rejected before he penned a five-year contract extension with the Premier League side in October 2013.

"Birmingham City's parent company has appointed Carson Yeung's brother-in-law as its new chief executive and managing director. Birmingham International Holdings Limited (BIHL) has named Ma Shui Cheong with immediate effect. It is the latest step in a power battle at Birmingham's Hong Kong based owners which is not expected to have any impact on the Sky Bet Championship club. Former Blues owner Carson Yeung was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for money laundering . There were concerns former Blues owner Yeung was acting as a shadow director from prison, where he is serving six years for money laundering. But putting Ma in place is likely to strengthen the board - who have flagged up a suspected misappropriation of funds to police as they try to be as transparent as possible - against Yeung as the pair are understood to be at loggerheads. The appointment of the 53-year-old is also believed to help the position of Panos Pavlakis, who is running the club in England, as de facto MD. A statement confirmed: 'The board of directors of Birmingham International Holdings Limited, together with its subsidiaries announces that Mr. Ma Shui Cheong (Mr. Ma), the Vice Chairman and an executive Director of the Company, was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the Company with effect from 27 January 2015.'

"Cesc Fabregas recently admitted that he never expected to play for Chelsea and always had issues with Blues captain John Terry while he was playing at Arsenal. From Luis Figo swapping Barcelona for Real Madrid to Sol Campbell ditching Tottenham in favour of Arsenal, there have always been players prepared to move to rivals. But some went further - vowing never to play for clubs or managers and then going back on their word. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at some of those forgetful individuals. Samuel Eto'o (right) swore he would never play for Chelsea when he was at La Liga giants Barcelona . He also said he would never play for Jose Mourinho, but he joined him at Inter Milan in 2009 . Eto'o then joined Mourinho and Chelsea when he signed for the Premier League club in 2013 . Samuel Eto'o - Chelsea and Jose Mourinho . The Cameroonian striker did this twice. After Barcelona's infamous Champions League clash with Chelsea in 2006 in which the Spanish club were appalled at the condition of Stamford Bridge pitch, Eto'o said: . 'Never will I sign for a team trained by Mourinho. He wrecked things completely with his behaviour surrounding the two games between our sides. 'I insist Barca boss Frank Rijkaard is the better coach despite however many titles the Portuguese has won.' He added he would rather 'sell groundnuts in my village than to play for a pathetic team like Chelsea'. In 2009 Eto'o moved to join Mourinho's Inter Milan and then in 2013 he again joined the Portuguese manager, this time at Chelsea.

But the Spanish midfielder joined the west London club last summer from Barcelona . Cesc Fabregas - Chelsea . The former Arsenal midfielder recently admitted he hadn't ever expected to play for Chelsea. He said: 'Three years ago no (I never thought I'd come to Chelsea). It just shows you how you can never tell in life, and even more so in football. We had a very intense rivalry with Mourinho. There were disagreements with him and (John) Terry too. Chelsea were always the team that I most wanted to beat.' And before his move to Barcelona in 2011, Cesc Fabregas said: 'If some day I leave Arsenal it will never be to sign for another English team. I'm very sure.' But in the summer of 2014 Fabregas did move back to England. With Chelsea. Alan Smith said the only club he would never play for was Manchester United, he then moved there . Smith tussles for the ball with Chelsea's Joe Cole during their Premier League clash . Alan Smith - Manchester United . Alan Smith was held up as Leeds United's poster boy when he made his debut aged just 18. The academy graduate was born and raised in the city and had a full understanding of the club's rivalry with Manchester United. When asked in an interview if there was a team he'd never play for, he responded: 'Yeah. Man United.' He joined Alex Ferguson's side shortly after in 2004. When at Arsenal, Gael Clichy said that players only moved to Manchester City for financial reasons . But just two years later Clichy, pictured here playing against Hamburg, signed for City . Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Samir Nasri also joined City like Clichy did . Gael Clichy - Manchester City . When Manchester City were taken over, one of their first things they did was to start poaching Arsenal players, beginning with Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor. But one player who said he would never make the move was Gael Clichy, who claimed he wasn't interested in being a mercenary. In 2009 he said: 'I really believe if you are a player who thinks only about money then you could end up at Manchester City. 'You have to think if you want to play for a big club and have your image or if you want to play for a good club and earn big money. When you ask someone to move for something like £300,000 a week it is just crazy.' But just two years later Clichy had changed his tune and joined the club. He said: 'I'm really happy to be joining such a great club. I hope I can add to the quality we already have here because we have a fantastic squad who I believe will continue to get better. I can't wait to get started and I think anything is possible with this team.' Roberto Mancini swore Carlos Tevez would not play for the club again after he refused to come off the bench . Tevez fell out with the club and didn't play for them from late September 2011 until March 2012 . But later that season Tevez played 10 games for the club and helped them win the Premier League title . Roberto Mancini - Carlos Tevez . In 2011, then-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini swore Carlos Tevez would not play for him or the club again after he refused to come on as a substitute against Bayern Munich. He said: 'I have helped him for the last two years and I can't accept this from him. For me, he's finished. I cannot go on with him. If I decide these things then he's finished. 'I have helped him and now he's refused to play. At Bayern Munich, do you think this would happen? Would it happen at Milan or United? I am the manager and I make the decisions and in my opinion he can't play for me again. 'I am unhappy and I should be unhappy with this. I will speak in the next days with the chairman Khaldoon. That is normal because he is the chairman.' But in March that season, after Tevez had spent months playing golf in his native Argentina, Mancini brought him back into the side to face Chelsea. He played nine more times after that in the same season, scoring three goals. He then played for the club 47 times the following season.","Cesc Fabregas said he never thought he'd play for Chelsea .

The top-seeded Seahawks, who are trying to become the NFL's first repeat champion in 10 years, used a suffocating defence and explosive fourth quarter to put what had been a close game out of reach. 'The guys played really hard tonight and played a really good tough, physical game,' Seattle head coach Pete Carroll said. 'Our guys hung in there tough and kept the score down and allowed for some guys to make things happen.' Defending Super Bowl champions Seattle Seahawks beat the Carolina Panthers 31-17 on Saturday .

"The New England Patriots fought back from 14-point deficits twice to beat the Baltimore Ravens 35-31 in a thrilling divisional playoff contest as they advanced to the AFC Championship game for the fourth straight year. The Patriots will now host the winners of the game between Denver and Indianapolis with a place in the Super Bowl on the line. New England did not lead in the game until quarterback Tom Brady connected with Brandon LaFell for a 23-yard touchdown with five minutes to play to give the Patriots their 35-31 advantage. Brandon LaFell  catches athe go-ahead touchdown to put the Patriots into the AFC Championship game . Joe Flacco (left) and Tom Brady shake hands after a pulsating play-off contest at Foxborough . The score allowed Brady, who threw for three touchdowns, to break Joe Montana's record of 45 playoff touchdowns. The Ravens, who twice since 2000 had beaten the Patriots in playoff games, demonstrated their intent on the game's first drive with Joe Flacco leading them on a five-play, 71-yard drive culminating in a 19-yard touchdown pass to Kamar Aiken. The freezing Foxborough crowd were stunned when, on their second possession, the Ravens scored again, Flacco, who threw for four touchdowns in the game, finding Steve Smith who beat Patriots cornerback Darrelle Revis on a slant. Brady, who passed for 367 yards, brought the Patriots back with a clever four-yard touchdown run. Duron Harmon intercepts Flacco's Hail Mary in the end zone to seal victory for the Patriots . A stunning play saw Danny Amendola level the score at 28-28 after Julian Edelman's 51-yard pass . New England pulled level at 14-14 when Brady found Danny Amendola with a 15-yard touchdown pass, the receiver evading a tackle before a spectacular dive into the end zone. If Baltimore were downhearted, they showed no signs of it with Daryl Smith showing great awareness to intercept a Brady pass towards Rob Gronkowski. From the resulting possession, the Ravens advanced down the field with the confident Flacco splitting two Patriots defenders to find Owen Daniels and send Baltimore in at the half with a 21-14 lead. Busted coverage from the Patriots defense allowed Flacco to find a wide-open Justin Forsett with a 16-yard touchdown pass that he ran in unchallenged in the third quarter. Justin Forsett was in sensational form in the first half and ended the game with 129 yards . Once again New England had dug themselves a 14-point hole. But Brady found Gronkowski for a five-yard touchdown and then the Ravens were caught out by a brilliantly worked play as Brady passed back to receiver Julian Edelman and the former college quarterback threw a 51-yard pass to Amendola. The Ravens' attempt at a comeback was effectively ended when a long throw from Flacco towards Torrey Smith in the end zone was picked off by Duron Harmon.","Brady passed for 367 yards and four touchdowns as the Patriots reached the AFC Championship .

"The NFL did not receive a video of Ray Rice knocking out his fiancee in a casino elevator before it was published online after they failed to investigate the case properly, according to an independent review. 'The NFL should have done more with the information it had and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the February 15 incident,' former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III said in a statement after releasing his 96-page report on Thursday. The Ravens running back was only suspended for two games after his arrest for punching his now-wife Janay during a night out at an Atlantic City, New Jersey casino in February. After video of the incident emerged on TMZ, he was released by the team and suspended indefinitely from the league, although the latter decision was ultimately reversed. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell did not see the video of Ray Rice punching his fiancee in a lift . The running back is a free agent . In his report, Mueller said he can find no evidence the league received the video of the incident. A law enforcement official previously said he had mailed a DVD to NFL headquarters in April. The report said a review of phone records and emails of NFL employees showed no evidence that anyone in the league had seen the video before Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice. The private investigation without subpoena power did not include any contact with the law enforcement official who claimed the DVD had been sent to the league. The officer had also played the Associated Press a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number dated April 9, in which a woman verifies receipt of the DVD and says: 'You're right, it's terrible.' The official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to share the evidence, said he took steps to avoid being found or identified by the NFL. 'We have reviewed the report and stand by our original reporting,' said Kathleen Carroll, the AP's executive editor. 'The Mueller team did ask us for source material and other newsgathering information, but we declined. Everything that we report and confirm goes into our stories. We do not offer up reporters' notes and sources.' Cameras caught the moment that Rice punched his then-fiancee Janay in the face in a casino lift . Rice  was initially suspended for two games and then released by the Ravens over the footage . Mueller's report disputed this, saying that investigators 'found no evidence that anyone at the NFL had or saw the in-elevator video before it was publicly shown'. 'We also found no evidence that a woman at the NFL acknowledged receipt of that video in a voicemail message,' Mueller said. Investigators spoke with Goodell and more than 50 NFL employees, all 188 women who had been in the NFL office building on the day of the supposed voicemail, and looked at e-mails from all league officials, many of which contradicted the notion they might have viewed the elevator video. The probe also searched more than 400 NFL employee computers plus mobile phones of top NFL executives. 'We found no evidence the in-elevator video was or had been stored or viewed on a league computer prior to the video's public release,' Mueller said. But Mueller also found the NFL's deference to the law enforcement process involving Rice 'led to deficiencies in the league's collection and analysis of information during its investigation.' The approach 'can foster an environment in which it is less important to understand precisely what a player did than to understand how and when the criminal justice system addresses the event.' Robert Mueller concluded in his report that the NFL had substantial information about the case . Mueller's report details some of the efforts the NFL made in obtaining the video, but said the league should have taken additional steps to find out what happened inside the elevator. 'League investigators did not contact any of the police officers who investigated the incident, the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office, or the Revel to attempt to obtain or view the in-elevator video or to obtain other information,' the report said. 'No one from the league asked Rice or his lawyer whether they would make available for viewing the in-elevator video they received as part of criminal discovery in early April.' The report also said the league didn't follow up on initial conversations with the Ravens to determine whether the team had more information. The official showed the AP multiple videos from the casino the night Rice was arrested. Those videos included security cameras from inside and outside the elevator and two cellphone videos that included some audio. The league said it considered the video published by TMZ in September to be new evidence meriting an indefinite suspension. Janay Rice appeared at a press conference with her husband in May and apologised for her part . Its emergence drew renewed backlash to the league from women's organizations, members of Congress and players - all calling for more detail on how the NFL handled the case. Giants owner John Mara and Steelers President Art Rooney, the men appointed by Goodell as liaison's to the investigation, said Mueller made six recommendations that the owners will review.  Rooney and Mara discussed the report's recommendations with Goodell on Thursday. Rooney and Mara agreed that the league's policy on domestic violence was insufficient. 'We were slow to react, and in the case of Ray Rice, the original punishment was insufficient,' their statement said. 'In addition, the steps taken by the NFL to investigate this matter were inadequate. Since then, a new policy concerning domestic violence and other rules for conduct violations have been put into place.' In the wake of the knockout punch video becoming public, Rice was released by the Ravens. He won a legal appeal in November to overturn the indefinite suspension but did not play in the 2014 NFL season and remains a free agent.","Independent review by former FBI director Robert S.

"Justin Rose knows all about the magic of The Open Championship and the unrivalled buzz generated by the massive audience it reaches through being shown on BBC television. In 1998, the Englishman went from being a shy, gangly 17-year-old known only among the golfing cognoscenti to the talk of British sport. Just a month after Michael Owen slalomed through the Argentina defence to score ‘that’ goal at the World Cup, Rose holed an unforgettable 60-yard pitch shot on the 72nd hole of The Open at Royal Birkdale to eventually finish joint fourth. Justin Rose burst to to world-wide prominence by finishing joint fourth at The Open Championship in 1998 . It was a stunning performance, and Rose and Owen became linked in the minds of sports fans owing to the fact they were both rarely-gifted teenagers and everyone had been able to watch both events. Now Rose fears that vital avenue with regard to exposure of golf to a new audience will be cut off if, as expected, live coverage of the game’s most prestigious event is transferred to Sky. ‘I think having golf coverage on free channels is important to the growth of the game,’ he said. ‘You can see it through the massive support Andy Murray receives and that’s largely because Wimbledon is still on the Beeb. It resonates because everyone watches it.’ Rose’s dismay is echoed by Ryder Cup colleague Stephen Gallacher, who believes the decision to hand over all live coverage would have a far-reaching impact on the game. Scotsman Stephen Gallacher fears moving The Open to Sky would have a far-reaching impact on the game . The down-to-earth Scot is fully aware that most of the UK players who became superstars, like Rory McIlroy, Ian Woosnam, Sir Nick Faldo and Graeme McDowell, came from the sort of working-class households who struggle to afford Sky. ‘I think the decision is going to have a big impact on British golf in general,’ said Gallacher. ‘It’s a real shame the R&A is making this decision as not everyone can afford satellite television and while the Sky coverage is great, it’s going to be very disappointing for those who wait all year to watch BBC coverage of The Open.’ That theme was taken up by 2012 winner Ernie Els, who admitted he was amazed the R&A could even be thinking of giving The Open to Sky. Rory McIlroy kisses the Claret Jug after his two-stroke victory at the 2014 Open Championship . McIlory's triumph was available for all to see on BBC, but that all may change with the rumoured new TV deal . ‘I am really surprised and can only conclude that Sky must be offering huge bucks for the R&A to be considering it,’ said the big South African, who lives for part of the year in the UK. ‘The BBC may not be so great following the golf ball with their cameras these days but think of all that tradition. ‘It’s going to have a huge impact on golf in Britain. Everyone has got the BBC but not everybody is going to pay to watch Sky. I have quite a few friends who still refuse to pay for Sky. The great thing about the BBC coverage is you can just sit there all day and watch, with nothing but uninterrupted coverage.’ Rose used to do exactly that when growing up. However, he recognises the world has changed and believes the BBC has been letting the sport down in recent years. ‘I think the image of the game has struggled under the BBC and you can see that with their Sports Personality of the Year awards,’ he said. ‘Some of the winning European Ryder Cup teams could and should have been honoured. ‘The fact also that Rory McIlroy didn’t win the major award last year comes down to the fact so little golf is shown on the BBC these days and much more on Sky. It clearly impacted on that decision.’ An announcement on the next television contract is expected within the next fortnight.","Justin Rose burst to to world-wide prominence at the 1998 Open .

"American Dustin Johnson denies he has had a drug problem but admits 'drinking to excess' was an issue he had to address. The 30-year-old, who on Tuesday night announced the birth of his first child, a son, with fiancee Paulina Gretsky, is currently on a voluntary leave of absence from the PGA Tour. His disappearance from the tour in late July prompted allegations in the United States of a positive test for cocaine - claims which have dogged him for several years but which he has always strenuously denied. Dustin Johnson has denied cocaine is the reason he chose to sit out the last six months of the PGA Tour . Johnson's admission he was taking a break to tackle 'personal challenges' only intensified speculation, but in his first interviews since the announcement the big-hitting Ryder Cup star has again dismissed the drug claims, revealing his battle has been with alcohol. 'I did not have a problem,' he told ESPN and SI.com, talking specifically about cocaine. 'It's just something I'm not going to get into. I have issues but that's not the issue.' Johnson is set to return to the PGA tour in a fortnight at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines . Johnson insisted drugs 'didn't really have a role in my life'. He said: 'Like everyone I'm tested regularly by the Tour and as far as that's concerned ... I haven't failed anything. 'I would drink and drink to excess.

'Obviously it was on a hard court, and there were some things that I did in that match which I believe will work in a couple days' time. 'So I've learnt stuff from playing against him there and at the IPTL and watching him a bit, stuff that I feel I can use and exploit in his game.'","Andy Murray trained ahead of his quarter-final with Nick Kyrgios .

"A panel of international handicappers has made the race to be Europe’s top horse for the 2014 Flat season a three-way tie between Aidan O’Brien’s Derby winner Australia, John Gosden’s electric miler Kingman and Kevin Ryan-trained The Grey Gatsby, winner of the French Derby and Irish Champion Stakes. All three horses were each given a handicap rating of 127 after enjoying stellar seasons.

"Newmarket officials are searching for a rapid outcome after being left in the unsatisfactory position of having to potentially make significant changes to its prestigious Autumn 2015 two-year-old programme. The race switches will mean schedules published in diaries and calendars, important sources of information as racegoers plan visits to the Jockey Club-owned track, will be out of date. It also means further upheaval at a venue which controversially lost the Group One Champion Stakes to Ascot in 2011 much to the annoyance of many of its regular attenders. Newmarket are considering making significant changes to its prestigious Autumn 2015 schedule . Definitely moving is the Group One Middle Park Stakes, which will revert to its tradition slot during the Cambridgeshire Festival on Saturday 26 September. The one-year experiment of staging Future Champions day 24 hours before Champions Day at Ascot appears over while a new option of running the Group One Dewhurst Stakes on Saturday 10 October has still to be confirmed. Amy Starkey, Regional Director of the Jockey Club’s East Region, welcomed the new date of the Middle Park but conceded both the composition and date of other race days had still to be finalised. Starkey said: ‘We can move of the Dewhurst Stakes but it does not mean we will. We will act in the best interests of Newmarket, the Jockey Club and British racing. There are a number of options and we are working through them with the BHA.’ The latest changes have been sanctioned by the European Pattern Committee which agrees race slots on the international calendar. Brian Kavanagh (left) says the European Pattern Committee have reluctantly given their approval . Staging the six-furlong Middle Park and seven-furlong Dewhurst on the same Future Champions day card was another controversial 2011 move. The fact there should now be the traditional two-week gap between the races will be seen as a victory over the fixture-list tinkermen, who pay little attention to tradition. Brian Kavanagh, chairman of the EPC, said: ‘Having the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs and the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs on the same programme is not ideal. ‘The British authorities initially came to us with these changes and believed in them at the time. Somewhat, reluctantly the EPC gave its approval at the time and we are now going back to a preferable outcome. It is still not perfect but it is an improvement.’ The switches in the British fixture list have been allowed because the French authorities requested the Group One Prix Jean Luc Lagardere, run at the Longchamp Arc meeting, be extended from seven furlongs to a mile, so not presenting a proximity clash with the Dewhurst.

The gelding, a winner at the last two Cheltenham Festivals, has failed to win in his two steeplechase runs this season, unseating at Aintree in December on his last effort. But his record at the Festival means he is still prominent in the Gold Cup betting.

"Wales centre Scott Williams admits he was surprised by the international retirement of British and Irish Lions prop Adam Jones. Jones announced his retirement from international rugby on Saturday night after winning 95 Wales caps and playing in five Tests for the Lions. The 33-year-old Blues prop had been left out of Wales coach Warren Gatland's 34-man RBS 6 Nations training squad, which followed his omission from the autumn international series earlier this season. Wales and British and Irish Lions prop Adam Jones has retired from international rugby . Jones (right), pictured with the Six Nations trophy in March 2013, was left out of this year's Wales squad . But, as the Wales players assembled at their Vale of Glamorgan training base on Monday ahead of the Six Nations opener with England in Cardiff on February 6, Williams summed up the mood of shock in the Welsh camp at the international retirement of the veteran tight-head prop. 'I was a little bit surprised but Adam's been a world-class prop over the last couple of years,' Williams said. 'He's done a lot for the country. 'It's obviously his personal decision but he's still got a lot left in his career.' Wales centre Scott Williams has revealed his surprise at the news of Jones' retirement . Jones (second left) attempts to make a tackle on Italy's Alessandro Zanni at the Millenium Stadium . Gatland opted for current number one Samson Lee, plus Aaron Jarvis and Scott Andrews as his tighthead prop options in the Six Nations, but did leave the door open for Jones last week by saying he would be in the frame if injuries struck. But Jones said in a statement released by his agents Big Red Management: 'I feel like I am more than just injury cover, and have therefore decided to call it a day.' However, Jones said he plans to continue playing regional rugby for another two to three years before moving into coaching. Wales reported a clean bill of health after the final European fixtures last weekend and, unlike England, have had few injuries to contend with in their build-up to the Millennium Stadium clash between the countries on Friday week. Jones played in five Tests for the British and Irish Lions and was capped 95 times by Wales in his career . But Scarlets centre Williams insisted England would still 'take some beating' despite Owen Farrell, Kyle Eastmond, Geoff Parling and Tom Wood joining an injury list which has already seen Ben Foden, Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes, Joe Launchbury and Ed Slater ruled out of the Cardiff opener for one reason or another. 'They've had a few injuries but they're still a world-class side and they're going to take some beating,' Williams said. 'We've got to make sure we work hard in the next 11 days if we want a chance to win. 'But we've got a good group of boys here and we all work hard. 'It's going to be a tough week and we've already started with a little bit of conditioning, but there's not much time before the first game.'","Adam Jones is retiring from international rugby with 95 caps for Wales .

"Scottish Rugby Union chief executive Mark Dodson has defended Vern Cotter's decision to include Hugh Blake in his RBS 6 Nations squad. The former New Zealand Under-20s back-rower only moved to Edinburgh last month and has yet to even feature for the capital club. The 22-year-old has been included at the expense of former Dark Blues skipper Kelly Brown and Scarlets flanker John Barclay. Hugh Blake in action for the New Zealand U20s at the 2012 Junior World Cup in South Africa . Retired Scotland international Andy Nicol and Peter Wright both criticised the hurried inclusion of Blake, claiming it sent the wrong message to the nation's juniors. But Dodson insists there are plenty of home-grown youngsters receiving their chance to shine. The chief exec - who previously described himself as a 'pure-bred Englishman' - said: 'I don't think it is sending the wrong message out to our youngsters. 'It might have done had we not capped so many young Scottish players over the last two years. 'Hamish Watson is in the squad, so is Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and Ben Toolis. It is not as if we've brought Hugh Blake in and no-one else is getting capped. 'People should also not make the assumption that we have not been tracking Hugh Blake. We've been tracking him for ages. Scotland coach Vern Cotter believes Blake can bring something 'special' to the national squad . 'We had him watched down in New Zealand making sure the progress is there and Vern believes this boy can bring something to the squad that we don't have. 'He has a special skill set that we don't possess.' Former newspaper advertising chief Dodson caused a stir three years ago when he set out a list of ambitious targets for the SRU - including a World Cup win in 2015. He repeated that aim just before last year's Six Nations kicked-off - then watched as the Scots were humbled 20-0 by England and thrashed 51-3 by Wales. But with this year's championships just a fortnight away and the World Cup in England another eight months down the road, Dodson insists he does not regret setting the bar high. Former Scotland international Andy Nicol has criticised Cotter's decision to include Blake in his squad . 'I said before our aim is to win the World Cup and I don't walk away from that,' said the 53-year-old. 'What I mean is that we have got to get this tanker pointing in the right direction. When I first came the expectation was so low, that people did not think we had the wherewithal to win anything. 'They all said we couldn't pay down debt, we couldn't attract top coaches, that we couldn't get our pro teams in a decent place, we couldn't sell the naming rights for the stadium and we will never get blue-chip sponsors. 'Well since I've come in we've got Vern Cotter in as coach, we've got BT to sponsor Murrayfield, we've paid more debt down than we've ever done before. 'So all those things that people thought were impossible we have done. 'We've turned the ship around off the pitch, now we need to do it on it. Our goal should be to win the World Cup. If we win it, then fantastic. Veteran flankers Kelly Brown (left) and John Barclay have been left out of Cotter's Six Nations squad . 'If we don't, but improve as a nation, then we are moving in the right direction and that was what it was all about.' So bad were Scotland in last year's Six Nations that there were calls from some pundits for the Dark Blues to be kicked out of the tournament - or at least made to pre-qualify. But following an encouraging autumn Test series in which the Scots pushed the world champion All Blacks close as well as beating Argentina and Tonga, Dodson does not expect to face similar opposition to their involvement. 'There was a lot of hysteria around last year and justifiably people were upset,' he said. 'But we had the perfect storm of things that went wrong. We had injuries, we had a pitch that for no fault of our own cut up badly and we didn't perform against England, which the Scottish public won't tolerate. 'But things weren't as bad as people portrayed. 'There is always people jumping the anti-Scotland bandwagon down south, especially in a year with an independence vote. 'It was all ill-informed nonsense. It was all a year after France finished bottom of the Six Nations and I didn't see a clamour of people asking them to pre-qualify.'","Hugh Blake only moved to Edinburgh last month .

"Ireland chiefs remain hopeful Eoin Reddan will beat his medial knee ligament strain in time to face Italy in the Six Nations opener in Rome. The Leinster scrum-half damaged his knee in Saturday's 20-20 Champions Cup draw with Wasps, and now faces a race against time to be ready to take on Italy on Saturday, February 7. Munster scrum-half Conor Murray is 'scheduled to have further scans this week' on the disc problem in his neck that also threatens to rule him out of Ireland's opening Six Nations clash. Ireland remain hopeful that Eoin Reddan will be passed fit to face Italy in their Six Nations opener . Leinster number eight Jamie Heaslip is carrying a shoulder problem, and will not take part in contact work in Ireland training this week. 'Eoin strained medial ligaments in his knee and is being rehabbed in an effort to be fit for the first game of the Six Nations,' read an Ireland statement. Head coach Joe Schmidt's 46-man training squad convened at the Carton House base on Monday to start preparations for their Six Nations title defence in earnest. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has a number of injuries to deal with in the build-up to their opening match in Rome . Munster lock Dave Foley was unable to throw himself into proceedings, as he suffered ligament damage to his wrist in the weekend's 65-10 hammering of Sale Sharks. 'Scans have confirmed ligament damage in Dave's wrist and he will have a surgical consultation this week,' read the Ireland statement. 'Conor (Murray) is scheduled to have further scans this week. 'Jamie's (Heaslip) shoulder continues to recover, he will be rested from contact this week. Conor Murray (centre) is set for further scans this week on the disc problems in his neck . Jamie Heaslip is still recovering from a shoulder injury and will be rested from contact this week . Ireland confirmed that Connacht centre Robbie Henshaw is fit to train after ankle trouble, in one piece of news that will be a big boost to boss Schmidt. The 21-year-old is likely to prove a mainstay of Ireland's Six Nations campaign now that his fitness doubt has been resolved. Connacht's Kieran Marmion is at least one scrum-half fit to train this week, but Schmidt's determination to have Reddan in action in Rome is clear given Ireland have tasked their medics with aiming to fast-track his return to fitness. Ireland will already be without British and Irish Lions fly-half Johnny Sexton for their Stadio Flaminio clash, with the Racing Metro man still completing a 12-week lay-off after four concussions in 12 months. Schmidt will not want to be without Sexton's Lions half-back partner Murray, but should the Munster playmaker fail to recover from neck trouble he will certainly want to call on Reddan's vast experience. Ireland's Johnny Sexton is still unavailable from his 12-week lay-off after a series of concussions .","Ireland hoping scrum-half Eoin Reddan will be able to play against Italy .

"Wales prop Adam Jones has said 'I feel like I am more than just injury cover' after announcing his retirement from international rugby. Jones, 33, won 95 Wales caps and played in five Tests for the British and Irish Lions. He is also among a group of just six Wales players to have featured in three Grand Slam-winning teams. Wales' British and Irish Lions prop Adam Jones had decided to call time on his international career . The Cardiff Blues prop, though, was left out of Wales coach Warren Gatland's 34-man RBS 6 Nations training squad, which followed his omission from the autumn international series earlier this season. Gatland opted for current number one Samson Lee, plus Aaron Jarvis and Scott Andrews as his tighthead prop options in the Six Nations, which kicks off when Wales host England on Friday week. In a statement released by his agents Big Red Management, Jones said: 'This year, I promised myself that I would work as hard as possible and do everything within my power to get back into the Wales squad. 'Despite putting my all into this, it has become apparent that it wasn't enough. 'I feel like I am more than just injury cover, and have therefore decided to call it a day. 'It has been a tough week for me, but the support from the Welsh fans has been overwhelming, just as it has been ever since my first cap.' The 33-year-old, pictured for the British and Irish Lions in June 2013, insists he is more than just injury cover . Gatland has not yet responded to Jones' decision, but it is clear that the veteran tighthead has been left unimpressed by missing out on the Six Nations squad. Before the squad was announced last Tuesday, Jones had been strongly backed to earn a recall, especially when Scarlets forward Rhodri Jones was ruled out of the entire Six Nations tournament due to a shoulder injury. Speaking last Tuesday during his squad announcement press conference, Gatland said: 'At the moment, Samson is our number one tighthead and we have been very impressed with his progress. 'We know exactly what Adam can and can't do, and things that he is still working on. 'I don't think he is the sort of player that you pick on the bench and ask to make an impact. He is a starting number three. 'I know that he is working hard and the door is definitely not closed. When we name a larger squad of 45 in the summer to start preparing for the World Cup, he has got a big chance of being part of that.' Jones is not the sort of player you pick on the bench and ask to make an impact, according to Warren Gatland . Jones continued: 'Playing for my country has been the proudest moment of my professional career. 'However, it is now time for me to step aside and let new talent run out in the red jersey of Wales. 'I am committed to my club Cardiff Blues and look forward to the rest of the season where we are targeting success in Europe and the Guinness PRO12. 'As a child it was my dream to play rugby for Wales. 'The sport is almost a religion here, and I am honoured to have played for my country and to have represented the British and Irish Lions. 'I have loved every minute playing for Wales - the highs far outweighing the lows - and I am incredibly proud of what I've achieved and accomplished in the red jersey.' Jones and Gethin Jenkins (left) celebrate Wales' Six Nations victory at the Millennium Stadium in 2013 . Former Wales captain Ryan Jones, meanwhile, has hailed Jones for giving 'everything to the sport of rugby' after he announced he is stepping down from the Test arena. Jones, who skippered his namesake in Wales and Ospreys colours, said: 'Playing alongside Bomb, as he is affectionately known, has been an honour and a privilege. 'During my captaincy and career he's been ever-present and always one of the first names on the team sheet. 'He was feared, respected and liked by the opposition, and a huge personality in the changing room.

"Andre Russell was the hero as West Indies clinched a thrilling one-wicket victory over South Africa in the fourth one-day international at Port Elizabeth. After Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy had laid the platform with half-centuries, some brutal hitting down the order from Russell (64no) lifted the Windies to their victory target of 263 with one wicket and nine balls to spare. David Miller's unbeaten 130 - his first ODI century - helped the Proteas to 262 for eight, but it proved to be in vain as they suffered their first defeat of the series. Andre Russell was the hero as West Indies clinched a thrilling one-wicket victory over South Africa . Russell (64no) lifted the Windies to their victory target of 263 with one wicket and nine balls to spare . Boasting an unassailable 3-0 lead, the hosts opted to leave out star names Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander, and they were put into bat after losing the toss. Rilee Rossouw recorded his eighth single figure score in 13 matches when he edged Sheldon Cottrell to first slip for four, while Faf du Plessis edged behind off Jason Holder soon after. Morne van Wyk, playing his first ODI in nearly four years, gave Cottrell his second wicket after edging to wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin to leave South Africa on 32 for three. AB de Villiers' first innings since his incredible record-breaking century last week was rather more low key, the captain making 19 before nicking behind off Russell. Miller and JP Duminy accumulated steadily as they brought a sense of calm to proceedings, with the former thumping his seventh four to bring up his fifty off 75 balls. AB de Villiers of South Africa drops Russell while he was on 40 . David Miller's unbeaten 130 - his first ODI century - helped the Proteas to 262 for eight . Duminy fell seven runs shy of his own half-century when he chipped a return catch back to Sammy, while Farhaan Behardien was bowled by Holder. With South Africa facing posting a below-par total, Miller came into his own in the final few overs, bringing up his century with a crushing four through extra cover off Holder, who was launched back over his head straight after by the big-hitting left hander. But Holder claimed a couple of wickets in the final over to finish with four for 53 to stifle the Proteas. The total still looked to be too much for the Windies, who slipped to 73 for five in response, as their World Cup preparations once again appeared set for another blow. But Samuels and Sammy at least gave them some hope, the pair each whacking five fours and two sixes to keep the score ticking over. Farhaan Behardien runs a single after Russell narrowly avoids catching him . Morne van Wyk of South Africa walks off while the West Indies celebrate in the background . Sammy departed for 51 when he looked for another big hit, instead finding De Villiers running back from cover off Parnell although Russell settled into his stride in the same over with a well-placed four. He then registered back-to-back fours off Morkel but the momentum swung drastically back in South Africa's favour when Samuels was bowled by Behardien for 68. Holder contributed 13 before hitting Duminy to midwicket but Russell continued to find the boundary rope with regularity. It appeared they would still fall short when Carlos Brathwaite was run out but Russell belted successive sixes off Aaron Phangiso in the 48th over to go bring up his half-century. That left the Windies needing seven off the final 12 balls and Russell fittingly scored the winning runs with his fifth six, crunching Kyle Abbott over long-on to finish on 64 off 40 balls and ensure a memorable win.","The West Indies won their first match of the series against South Africa .

"Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal is confident of having his bowling action cleared by the International Cricket Council after undergoing an official test. Ajmal was put through his paces at an ICC accredited bio-mechanics centre in Chennai in India on Saturday, having already taken part in a 'private test' in a laboratory in Edgbaston in mid-January. Ajmal had ruled himself out of Pakistan's World Cup plans - his place seemingly going to inexperienced leg-spinner Yasir Shah. Saeed Ajmal has undergone an official test for his bowling action at a bio-mechanics centre in Chennai, India . Worcestershire bowler Ajmal was suspended last year after his bowling action was deemed illegal . 'I felt those who tested me were happy with my action,' Ajmal told Indian newspaper, The Hindu. 'I am hopeful, but ultimately the decision rests with them. 'I bowled 30 deliveries. And I bowled five different kinds of balls six times each. I bowled the doosra, the carrom ball, the off-spinner, (the) seam-up and the quicker one. 'If I had just wanted to bowl the off-spinner, I could have got my action cleared in two weeks. But I want to retain my variety. I think my doosra is within permissible limits now. 'If they are not happy with my doosra, then I feel I can still bowl effectively with my off-spinner and other deliveries.' The Pakistan off-spinner is confident that his bowling action will be cleared by the authorities . He claims he wants to be the number one bowler in the side and would rather retire than make up the numbers . Worcestershire spinner Ajmal was suspended from bowling for an illegal action last year after being reported during a Test against Sri Lanka. Following months of rehabilitation work, including under former Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, Ajmal appears keen to make up for lost time. 'I want to be a frontline bowler, the number one bowler in the side,' he said. 'I don't want to make up numbers. I would rather retire than do that. 'Saqlain Bhai (brother) told me there was no use being depressed. He inspired me to pick myself up.

"Five-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant has been ruled out of Thursday's game against defending champions San Antonio Spurs by a shoulder injury. The 36-year-old, who earlier this week admitted he has considered retiring at the end of the season, suffered a torn rotator cuff, according to preliminary results of an MRI exam. Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant may not play again this season due to shoulder injury . The Los Angeles Lakers guard hurt his right shoulder on a dunk in the second half of Wednesday's game against the New Orleans Pelicans. Bryant will return to Los Angeles and be examined by team doctors on Friday, to determine the severity of the tear. Bryant, a former league most valuable player, twice an NBA scoring leader and a two-time MVP of the NBA Finals, had sat out eight of the previous 16 games for 'rest' reasons and had complained about an achy shoulder. Bryant (left) played in only six games last season due to knee and Achilles tendon injuries . Asked Thursday before results of the MRI were known if an injury might encourage the team to shut Bryant down for the rest of the season, coach Byron Scott said a lot depended on how Bryant felt. 'He knows his body pretty well,' Scott told the Orange County Register. 'He's probably one of the toughest guys in this league as far as playing through injury and through pain.' The 36-year-old, a 16-time All-Star, is averaging 22.3 points from 35 games this season and is signed through next season after inking a two-year extension in 2013 for $48.5 million. Bryant, who is fourth on the NBA's all-time scoring list, played in only six games last season due to knee and Achilles tendon injuries as the Lakers struggled to a 27-55 record. This season, after losing Pau Gasol to free agency and another season to injury for veteran point guard Steve Nash, the Lakers are 12-31, second from last in the Western Conference.

"There are those who believe Darren Bent is past his Barclays Premier League sell-by date but it is not an opinion shared by the striker himself. ‘When I was playing regularly in the Premier League I was scoring a lot of goals,’ said Derby’s on-loan forward. ‘Am I still good enough? 100 per cent, definitely.’ Bent, once of England, marked his first start for the Championship club with his first goal. At the age of 30, and with parent club Aston Villa unlikely to want him back, Bent’s top-flight opportunities may rest with a permanent move to the iPro and promotion. Darren Bent (centre) scores from close range in Derby's 2-0 win over Chesterfield in the FA Cup . Bent (centre) wants to lead Derby into the Premier League and add to his goal tally in the division . ‘There was a time when I was playing regularly that I’d have spells of five or six goals in the same number of games,’ he said. ‘It’s a case of believing in myself. It’s pointless being judged on five minutes here and there.’ Bent’s close-range header in the first half and a late Will Hughes goal saw off League One neighbours Chesterfield. It is back to the promotion campaign tomorrow against Blackburn and Bent hopes he will have another chance to play alongside Chris Martin in a new 3-5-2 formation. Will Hughes (right) scored the second goal for Derby as they advanced into the fifth round of the FA Cup . ‘If I can help Chrissy and Derby get promotion, that is the aim for everyone concerned,’ added Bent. ‘I’ve scored more than 100 Premier League goals and it’s something I’m very proud of. ‘No-one can take that away from me and hopefully I can add a few more — with Derby next season.’","Darren Bent scored  on his Derby debut in the FA Cup win over Chesterfield .

"The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport leagues in the world and every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside. Newsmaker . The incensed version of Derrick Rose took centre stage following the Chicago Bulls' 108-94 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. In speaking with reporters after the game, he expressed his frustration in no uncertain terms. Rose said: 'We've got to give a better effort. It seems like we're not even competing and it's f***ing irritating. We're midway through the season; no excuses; when you don't have that edge you are going to get your (butt) whipped.' Questioning effort is a great way to set a locker room ablaze. Whether the ignited fire has its intended impact is a different story. Derrick Rose expressed his frustration at the Chicago Bulls' defeat by the Cleveland Cavaliers . The Bulls were beaten 108-94 by their Eastern Conference rivals on Monday in Ohio . Good Week . The Atlanta Hawks matched the all-time franchise record of a 14-game winning streak with victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. The 35-8 Hawks have surprisingly emerged as the hottest team in the NBA, using the recent stretch of phenomenal basketball to build a healthy lead over the Washington Wizards for the top seed in the Eastern Conference. With centre Al Horford leading the way, Atlanta matched a franchise record set back in 1993-94, when the team went 57-25 before losing to none other than the Pacers in the second round of the play-offs. The Atlanta Hawks beat the Indiana Pacers to extend their winning streak to 14 games . Bad Week . The Milwaukee Bucks have been among the NBA's most pleasant surprises this season, but maintaining their high level of play may prove difficult as the league has suspended center Larry Sanders. The 26-year-old big man will miss at least 10 games after violating the NBA's drug policy: this marks the second time in as many seasons that the league has disciplined Sanders, his 2013-14 suspension coming due to marijuana use. To be clear, the league has not announced what Sanders tested positive for in this instance. Sanders' suspension will continue 'until he is in full compliance with his treatment program' Sanders' production has dropped off a bit over the past two seasons after an excellent 2012-13 campaign, but he is still an important player for the Bucks. The Milwaukee Bucks saw their center Larry Sanders suspended by the league . The Bucks thrashed the New York Knicks when they met at London's O2 Arena last week . Brit Watch . Miami Heat veteran forward Luol Deng is currently dealing with an illness that kept him out of Wednesday's game. Although not quite the player he once was with the Chicago Bulls, Deng has continued to serve as a solid two-way player in his first season with the Heat. Injuries, however, are beginning to take their toll on the 29-year-old. He missed 19 games with a variety of afflictions last season and was hampered earlier this year by a hand injury. Britain's Luol Deng missed Miami Heat's game at the Charlotte Hornets through injury . And Finally . Being 34-years-old doesn't make one a senior citizen, but for Jason Richardson of the Philadelphia 76ers, it makes him quite a bit older than his team-mates. That's why the young Sixers had some fun with their veteran teammate on his birthday. To celebrate Richardson's birthday, 76ers players gave him adult diapers, a robe and baby food. Richardson (born in 1981), Andrei Kirilenko (1981), Luc Mbah a Moute (1986) and Malcolm Thomas (1988) are the only players on Philadelphia's roster who were not born in the 1990s. Kirilenko has yet to report to the team since being traded to Philadelphia earlier this season, so Richardson is the oldest player on the team by a good margin.

"West Ham striker Andy Carroll insists the belief is there in the squad that the club can qualify for Europe this season. The Hammers' 3-0 home win over Hull on Sunday - courtesy of goals from Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing - took them up to seventh in the  Premier League table after a run of four winless matches had seen them drop off the pace. Asked if West Ham were European contenders, Carroll told Sky Sports: 'There's a belief in the dressing room, I don't see why not. We haven't had a win in the last few games but we've had the performances that can take us up to the top.'

Morgan Amalfitano (centre) is congratulated by Carroll (right) and Stewart Downing (left) Downing (left) slotted in West Ham's third goal in an emphatic win at Upton Park . West Ham had struggled in the first half before turning the screw on Hull in the second. Downing, who added West Ham's third after a peach of a through-ball from Alex Song, added: 'We just moved the ball quicker in the second half - in the first half we didn't do it quick enough and we made it easy for Hull who had a lot of men behind the ball. 'In the second half we were making a lot of good runs and getting men in the box, so it was a much better performance.' The victory means West Ham climb above Liverpool into seventh in the table, four points off fourth place. The Hammers were booed off by their own fans at half-time and manager Sam Allardyce admits he told his team to be more direct in the second period. 'All this tippy-tappy stuff - everybody keeps on going about the right way to play football - is all a load of b******s sometimes,' Allardyce said. 'Getting the ball into the opposition box as quickly as you can with quality is definitely sometimes the best way forward and that's what we did in the second half and that's why we won the game.' Allardyce had no complaints with the crowd venting their frustration but believes Tuesday's penalty shoot-out win over Everton in the FA Cup may have had an effect on his players.

"From the little we know about Andrej Kramaric, he seems to be an individual who doesn’t want to pile too much pressure on himself. ‘I hope to score at least one goal and be better than Bosko Balaban!’ he grinned this week. There may have a been just a hint of humour attributed to that - his Croatian counterpart was a key component in the £9million move to Leicester - but Kramaric looks set to leave the Aston Villa flop behind and become a Premier League hit. That’s if his full Foxes debut at Tottenham on Saturday is anything to go by. Andrej Kramaric holds his head in his hands after being booked for diving against Tottenham . The Foxes' record signing can consider himself unlucky to have been denied what seemed like a penalty . Michel Vorm was lucky to avoid a red card and a penalty after he slid in against Kramaric but missed the ball . CLICK HERE to read Rob Draper's match report from Leicester's FA Cup win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Playing in behind Leonardo Ulloa, Kramaric was a bundle of energy and willing runner for a team who have so often lacked genuine options going forward away from home this season. Nigel Pearson will know he has a man who could be the key to survival this season - that added touch of invention and glimmer on the ball to open up gaps and allow Leicester’s wide players - Jeffrey Schlupp and Jamie Vardy in this case - to find their way in behind. The 23-year-old was the main outlet for Pearson here at White Hart Lane, and that bodes well for the immediate future. Having scored 28 goals already this season, more ought to follow. Kramaric is used to playing in front of barely 4,000 supporters for HNK Rijeka in Croatia, but doesn’t appear fazed by the daunting prospect of English football that Balaban and countless others struggled with. It’s Manchester United at Old Trafford up next. And he’s already been given a taste of what flair players at the top of the domestic game can expect; unfortunately, this experience wasn’t one he will have dreamt of back home. Kramaric dribbles down the wing while trying to evade the challenge of goalscorer Andros Townsend . The Croat striker goes in for a 50-50 challenge with French midfielder Etienne Capoue at White Hart Lane . Capoue tracks Leciester's record signing during the second half in north London . With Leicester a goal down, Kramaric scampered beyond the square-footed Younes Kaboul and bore down on Michel Vorm after Danny Drinkwater’s through ball. One-on-one, these are the situations he was bought for. One touch and off he went past the goalkeeper, ready to tap into an unguarded net. That would’ve been the only logical end to the move, but Vorm tripped him before the youngster had chance to equalise. On first viewing it was a clear penalty, but referee Robert Madley marched up to the attacker, signalled a dive and brandished a yellow card. Welcome to our world, Andrej, where officials are so petrified of being indecisive that everything is black and white. Kramaric did not dive - it was not a booking. The trick for him now is to shrug the episode off. He might have had that first goal for the club but, when stealing a yard in front of Fazio, met Vorm in inspired form - the Dutchman somehow managing to tip wide when Kramaric lashed at goal from eight yards. The signs for why Jose Mourinho fancied Kramaric at Chelsea are there for all to see. He must just hope that Madley doesn’t follow him in the weeks to come.

"The cash-strapped Rangers board has agreed a £10million emergency loan deal with Mike Ashley's Sports Direct firm, it has announced to the Stock Exchange. Without the injection of fresh funding, the Ibrox outfit would not have been able to cover pay cheques due to be delivered on Thursday. The loan will be secured against Murray Park, Edmiston House, Albion Car Park, and the club's registered trademarks - but not Ibrox. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley and his firm Sports Direct agree £10m emergency loan deal with Rangers . The move spells the end of attempts by the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - to have their own loan offer accepted. It was their promise to match Ashley's deal whilst demanding Ibrox remained unsecured that forced the Newcastle United owner to drop the stadium from the terms of his agreement. In return for the money - which will be paid to Rangers in two £5million tranches - Ashley will be able to nominate two more directors to the Light Blues board. His associates Derek Llambias and Barry Leach are already serving as chief executive and financial director. Ashley wanted to take out a security plan on Ibrox but is unable to do so under the terms of the new agreement . As well as that, Rangers will transfer 26 per cent of its holding in Rangers Retail Ltd (RRL). RRL was a joint venture set up by the club and Sports Direct, with Rangers in control of 51 per cent and Ashley's company controlling the rest. Fans, however, were already concerned that it was overly beneficial to Ashley. Now as part of the new loan deal, the club has also agreed that from the 2017/8 season, for the duration of the loan, any future shirt sponsorship proceeds 'will be for the benefit of RRL'. In a lengthy 7am statement to the Stock Exchange, the board said: 'The Board of Rangers announces that Rangers Football Club Limited has entered in to agreements with SportsDirect.com Retail Limited and associated companies, to provide a long term on-going credit facility of up to £10m. 'The Company's financial condition has been perilous for a number of months exacerbated by lower than expected match attendances. The Directors have implemented a cost cutting program with which they have made significant progress. 'There is however an immediate need for a substantial injection of capital, and the Directors have considered a number of options. 'The terms negotiated with SD (which are reversible in respect of the Facility) represent the optimum combination of quantum and duration of funding, allowing the Company time to arrange permanent capital which can be used for strengthening the playing squad. 'The Facility is structured in two separate interest free tranches. £5million will be available immediately for working capital purposes and for the repayment of the credit facilities with MASH Holdings Limited which was entered into on 27 October 2014. Chairman David Somers (left) and chief executive Derek Llambias (centre) are fully behind Ashley's plans . 'All rights and security associated with the MASH facility will be cancelled. 'The Club will transfer 26 per cent of the share capital in Rangers Retail Limited to SD for the duration of the Facility, which will be transferred back, at no cost, upon repayment of all outstanding sums owed by Rangers and its subsidiaries to SD. There is no specified repayment period for the first tranche of the Facility. 'The Facility is to be secured by (1) a floating charge over the Club's assets and (2) fixed charges over Murray Park, Edmiston House, Albion Car Park, and the Club's registered trademarks. 'None of the security that is being given to SD covers Ibrox Stadium, which is specifically excluded and remains in the full ownership of the Club, free from any security. 'SD will also have the right to nominate two directors to the board of Rangers for the duration of the Facility, any such nomination will be subject to regulatory consent pursuant to the AIM Rules and other regulatory bodies. Ashley's plans to invest in Rangers has been met with disapproval from fans who have protested against him . 'If the entire sum drawn down is repaid, the Facility will be deemed to be terminated, all security will be released, the 26 per cent of RRL will revert to the Company and all rights of SD to nominate Directors to the Board of the Company will cease. 'The second tranche of £5million, which repayable five years after drawn down, will be used, if required, for working capital purposes and is subject to due diligence by SD prior to drawn down. 'The Company has also agreed that from the 2017/8 season, for the duration of the Facility, any future shirt sponsorship proceeds will be for the benefit of RRL. 'RRL will declare a dividend of a total of £1,610,000 prior to the Transfer. 'The Club will use the proceeds of its share of this dividend, inter alia, to repay sums owing to SD in respect of the cessation of onerous leases on unprofitable stores entered into by a previous Rangers management team. Rangers play Old Firm rivals Celtic on Sunday in the Scottish League Cup for the first time since 2012 . 'The Directors would like to thank all the Rangers Stakeholders who showed an interest in helping the Company.' Chairman David Somers said: 'The Board has sought for some time to establish a long term funding solution for the Company in order to create a platform of stability to build for the future. 'This Facility begins this process and we very much hope that it will be augmented with further permanent capital in due course. 'In addition, the executive team have made strides in addressing the cost base of the Company in order to improve our financial condition and working capital profile. 'We very much hope that we can now move away from having to seek short term funding solutions and can focus our efforts towards investing in the first team playing squad, a return to profitability and to re-establishing Rangers in the top league in Scottish Football and in due course, to European competition. 'The Board now calls upon all shareholders to rally together to achieve this goal.' Ashley has now strengthened his grasp on the money streams entering the club, but the balance of power could yet swing away from him in the coming weeks if Dave King succeeds in routing the board at the general meeting he has called.","Rangers agree £10m emergency loan deal with Mike Ashley's Sports Direct .

"The first memories are cherished ones. For me, it is Liverpool vs Leeds in 1965, the all-red strip against the all whites. The goal-scorers stand out as iconic names: Roger Hunt, Billy Bremner, Ian St John. I’ll never forget that diving header of Ian St John to win the Cup. I would have been seven years old and after the game I was running about in the garden with my friends practising diving headers. Then there was Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul scoring for Spurs against Chelsea in 1967, the first time my team had made the final. Watching the team you supported winning a Cup for the first time was amazingly exciting. First FA Cup finals are like first loves; you never forget them. Sometimes we need reminding just how important the FA Cup is to our national game. On Saturday though, Bradford and Middlesbrough did the job for us, as did Cambridge United on Friday night. It is turning into one of the best weekends for the FA Cup for years, which everyone who understands English football will relish. Mark Yeates' (front) goal gave League One side Bradford a 4-2 lead in injury time against Chelsea on Saturday . Yeates (centre below) celebrates scoring the fourth goal as his Bradford team-mates enjoy the moment . Middlesbrough players celebrate with their travelling supporters after beating Manchester City 2-0 . Cambridge  players celebrate after holding Manchester United to a 0-0 draw in the FA Cup on Friday night . It has had such an pivotal role in our game. Over my childhood years, the finals are imprinted on my mind. The incredible physicality of that Leeds vs Chelsea final in 1970, the night-time replay at Old Trafford, the long throw and David Webb’s goal; Charlie George’s celebration in 1971; Jim Montgomery’s save in 1973 — ‘better than Gordon Banks,’ according to my uncle, who himself had been a schoolboy keeper on Tottenham’s books. FA Cup final day was like a bank holiday. In my house, it meant a big family gathering with friends, uncles, aunts and cousins coming round to watch the game. As a child, the excitement would grow throughout the week. It was like waiting for Christmas. Of course, it had a lot to do with the novelty of the game being on television. That in itself was a cause of excitement. In that week in May there was suddenly a glut of games on live television: the FA Cup final, England vs Scotland a week later and maybe a European final, if an English team had made it. It’s hard to believe those used to be perhaps the only live games of the season, other than the odd England match. How times have changed. I wouldn’t want to swap what we had then for the comprehensive TV coverage we have now. But it is clear that the rarity of televised football in those days magnified the importance of the FA Cup. That will never return and the fact that the Premier League is financially a much greater priority is not going to change. The kind of hype which was once reserved for the FA Cup final is now a week-by-week occurrence in Premier League games. I don’t believe there’s one magical reform which could restore the allure of the FA Cup. Ron Harris (centre) and John Hollins (right) parade the FA Cup after Chelsea's 2-1 replay win vs Leeds in 1970 . Football is a commercial business and the success of the Premier League was evident last week with the release of the list of richest clubs in Europe — all 20 of the Premier League clubs from last season are in the top 40. That demonstrates how strong the domestic product is and the TV money they can command. However, there is a need for a little balance from managers and players. In my day, winning the Cup was on a par with winning the league. Many fans, players, managers and even chairmen would prefer a glory day at Wembley to winning the league. I was lucky enough to play in four and win two finals. I remember my first against Manchester City in 1981. I was a bit frustrated that I was missing all the build up on the TV, because that had been such a part of my life. And when I walked out on to the pitch a couple of hours before kick-off, I was hoping that I was one of the players selected for an interview. I’d watched that day, that build-up and the pre-match interviews so many times as a kid, I just wanted to be a part of it. Fortunately, Bob Wilson, who worked for the BBC, picked me out. That was one of the iconic finals, with Ricky Villa’s amazing goal in the replay, having played so badly in the first game. When he set off on that famous run, we were all desperate for him to just hit it early, before he lost the ball. Fortunately he ignored us all and created one of the FA Cup’s great moments. These days you cannot expect the same kind of feelings from players. The FA Cup had become just one hyped game among the hundreds shown on TV. Players who are 20 or 25 now won’t have the same fond memories I had. Tottenham's Ricky Villa (centre) celebrates after scoring the winning goal in the 1980/81 FA Cup final .

You can remind players that when they look back on their career, it’s the Cup finals they will want to tell their grandchildren about — not finishing sixth in the Premier League. Having managed, I understand how difficult it is to balance a squad when the Premier League is your first objective. But equally, as a manager, the pinnacle is to win a trophy. Clearly your job prospects depend on how you do in the league, but for yourself and your own career, winning a cup will be hard to better. Fans know all this. They are the ones who are usually keener on their club taking the Cup more seriously than anyone else. Portsmouth have sunk right down to League Two and endure a horrendous time financially over recent years. But speak to most Portsmouth fans and the moments they remember, the stories they tell again and again will be about the day they won the FA Cup in 2008 with Harry Redknapp. You cannot make the FA Cup what it was. Television habits, culture, society and football have all moved on. But you ignore it at your peril. Football is about glory, excitement and winning. The money came to football because of the romance, not the other way around. People who don’t understand how important the FA Cup is in creating that romance don’t really understand what English football is about.

"Swansea City manager Garry Monk believes Gylfi Sigurdsson should not have been sent off despite having 'a lunge' during their 3-1 FA Cup fourth-round defeat at second tier Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. Swansea defender Kyle Bartley was dismissed after seven minutes for a foul on Josh King as the Blackburn forward raced through on goal while Sigurdsson left the Premier League side with nine men following a rash tackle on Chris Taylor. 'It warranted a yellow, but I don't think it was a red,' said Monk. Gylfi Sigurdsson was dismissed after a late lunge on Blackburn's Josh King . His red card left Swansea down to nine men during their 3-1 defeat at Blackburn in the FA Cup . 'He (Sigurdsson) had a lunge after he was kicked. He shouldn't react, but it wasn't dangerous. I don't think he was in any danger of hurting the player.' Iceland international Sigurdsson had put Swansea in front but Blackburn equalised through Taylor before Rudy Gestede and Craig Conway struck late on to send the Championship side into the fifth round.

"Sheffield United midfielder Stefan Scougall has every belief another romantic chapter in the cup 'fairytale' he has experienced since joining the club can be written on Wednesday when they attempt to secure a swift return to Wembley Stadium. Following his switch to the Sky Bet League One outfit from Livingston a year ago, Scougall has helped United spring a series of shocks and make considerable progress in knockout competitions. That has included beating Barclays Premier League Fulham last term en route to a Wembley FA Cup semi-final against Hull, in which he scored to put his team 2-1 up before they eventually lost 5-3. Stefan Scougall (right) is hoping to Sheffield United can spring another cup upset against Tottenham . Scougall leaps for the ball with Kyle Walker (left) during the Capital One Cup semi-final first-leg . The 22-year-old Scot has been involved in two major cup semi-finals since joining the Blades . The 22-year-old Scot has also been involved in an upset against top-flight opposition in this season's FA Cup when QPR were despatched in the third round, as well a run in the Capital One Cup that has seen Nigel Clough's men defeat another Premier League side in West Ham and then one more in Southampton to set up a last-four clash with Tottenham. The Blades contest the second leg of the semi-final against Spurs on Wednesday evening at Bramall Lane trailing 1-0 from last week's initial encounter. And on the prospect of United turning the tie around and making the Wembley final, Scougall said: 'It has been a fairytale for me so far, only a year into my contract and having played in two semi-finals. 'To this day, I still don't really think it's true I scored at Wembley. 'This is a chance to get back there, and hopefully on Wednesday night we can put things right and play there in a final. 'It is a major stadium and to play there at any stage of your career is a great moment for you, your family and friends, and for your club and team-mates.' United players race to celebrate after getting through against West Ham on penalties in the second round . Marc McNulty scores the winner to send Southampton crashing out in the quarter-finals . Reflecting on last Wednesday's first leg, which saw Spurs - who are sixth in the Premier League - take the lead through a second-half Andros Townsend penalty, Scougall added: 'Especially in the first half, we felt we had a good go at them and were maybe unlucky not to be 1-0 up. 'In the second half we maybe came off it a little bit or they maybe upped their game a little bit, but the main objective was to stay in the tie and it is still very much alive. 'There is nothing for us to fear and we are going to try to cause an upset - like what happened at the weekend (in the FA Cup fourth round) with Middlesbrough beating Manchester City and Bradford beating Chelsea. 'We have proved ourselves over the last year whenever we have played a team in a higher league that there is nothing to fear. We can go out and cause another upset. 'I think you will have around 30,000 Blades fans at Bramall Lane on Wednesday night, so I think that is going to help us and drive us on a little bit more. 'Hopefully we can give them something to cheer about.' Andros Townsend scores the winning goal from the penalty spot in the first-leg at White Hart Lane .

"Kenny Dalglish believes Sunday's Old Firm derby will be close no matter how strongly-fancied Celtic are. Celtic are 1/8 with some bookmakers to reach the Scottish League Cup final at the expense of Rangers. Rangers are in turmoil on and off the pitch with a major cash shortfall being accompanied by uncertainty over the manager's situation after Ally McCoist and then caretaker boss Kenny McDowall handed in their notices. Kenny Dalglish (centre) scores a penalty against Rangers during his time as a Celtic player . Dalglish (left) believes that the weekend's clash between Celtic and Rangers will be a close encounter . Rangers trail Scottish Championship leaders Hearts by 13 points while Celtic have scored eight goals without reply in three games in 2015, but Dalglish does not think form will have too much of an impact at Hampden on Sunday. 'It's always been relatively close,' the former Celtic player and manager said. 'But irrespective of your position in the league, or how you've been playing, or off the pitch, it won't make any difference. It's just what happens on the day that's going to decide who's going to win. 'I think it will be close, it will be really competitive. If it's Celtic, people will be saying they don't want to go in there complacent. If it's Rangers, they will be trying to say they've nothing to lose. 'How can you ever go into an Old Firm game saying you've nothing to lose? Everybody has got something to lose. It won't be a foregone conclusion. It can't be taken as given that anybody is going to win. 'And if they need any example of that then they just need to look at the cup ties that were played over the weekend in England. There were a few shocks there and there's no way you would have tipped Chelsea to lose four goals.' The last Old Firm fixture was in April 2012 with the Ibrox club's liquidation soon preventing the blue and green sides of the city meeting again until this weekend. And Dalglish feels their reunion is long overdue. Dalglish will be hoping Ronny Delia's side will emerge triumphant in the clash against Rangers . 'It's something both Celtic and Rangers fans have missed out on in the last three years, an Old Firm derby,' said Dalglish, who was promoting the fixture for 666BET.com. 'It's great to have it back in the calendar and it will be a huge occasion. 'It takes away a lot from the conversations about what's been going on at Ibrox and Celtic will be up for it as well so I think it's something that everybody will be looking forward to. 'Everybody misses the Old Firm games. Maybe the only clubs that haven't suffered are Dundee and Dundee United - when they get their derbies they get full houses. They are maybe not missing Rangers being in the Premiership but I think everyone else is.' Dalglish knew all about the rivalry having been brought up in the shadow of Ibrox as a Rangers fan before turning out in the green and white. And he has warned the many players making their derby debuts on Sunday that little can prepare them for what is in store. A 20-year-old Dalglish overcame his nerves to score from the spot on his Old Firm debut - a 2-0 League Cup win at Parkhead in August 1971. 'The most memorable one for me was the first one. We got a penalty kick and Billy McNeill told me to take it ... it was a bad idea,' he said. 'I remember winning 2-0 but I don't remember much else. Celtic will play Rangers at Hampden Park, with the winner advancing into the Scottish League Cup final . 'You know what it's about - you are born and brought up in the city. You know what the game is all about, you know what it means to everybody. 'And, by the way, if it doesn't mean as much to the people on the pitch as it does to the ones off it - then the ones on the pitch are going to have a hard time. 'People can stand and talk to you for 20 minutes and explain something to you, but until you actually experience it yourself it's hard to put it into perspective.'","Celtic take on Rangers in Sunday's Scottish League Cup semi-final .

"Bolton manager Neil Lennon has given up on signing Celtic forward Kris Commons this month. The former Parkhead boss had hoped to use the uncertainty over the former Scotland international's future to his gain and lure Commons south. But he has now ruled out a late January move after Celtic made it clear the out-of-contract attacker will not be sold in this transfer window. Bolton boss Neil Lennon used to be manager of Celtic before taking over the Championship club . Lennon wanted Kris Commons (right) to join him at Bolton but accepts it will not happen in January . Lennon told STV: 'Celtic have come out publicly and said he's not for sale, he won't be leaving and we haven't pursued that any further. 'I've got a great relationship with Celtic, a great relationship with Peter [Lawwell] and I don't want to damage that. 'People keep asking me about Kris and I feel uncomfortable talking about him because he is Celtic's player at the end of the day.' Commons, was a central figure under Lennon, netting 31 goals in the Northern Irishman's final season in charge. But under Ronnie Deila, he has been in and out of the side as he was forced to accept his position was not guaranteed. However, Lennon believes Celtic should look to tap into more than just his playing abilities as he recommended the 31-year-old for a future coaching role with the Hoops. Commons has not been a regular in the Celtic team under manager Ronny Deila . Lennon said: 'It was something that myself and Peter talked about. Kris gets the club, he gets Celtic. 'He was having a great season last year and we talked about it in terms of working again together when his career finished. He's an intelligent boy, I think he'd have plenty to offer on the coaching side of things. 'I think he would be an asset for Celtic in a coaching capacity.'","Neil Lennon wanted to sign Celtic midfielder Kris Commons in January .

"Rangers legends  joined forces to hit back at a cheeky stunt by Celtic supporters – kicking off Old Firm week with an old-fashioned war of words. A group of Celtic fans took out an advert in a Scottish Sunday newspaper paper branding Rangers a ‘new club which came into being in 2012’, declaring that this weekend’s League Cup semi-final will be the first meeting between the clubs – and hitting out at the ‘continuation fiction’ surrounding the Ibrox side. A number of the former Rangers greats at Ibrox for yesterday’s Fernando Ricksen Tribute Match took exception to this interpretation of history, Dutch great Ronald de Boer saying: ‘They are fans and I think only one per cent of people think that way. I think most people think differently - and they will be looking forward to this game. Ronald de Boer (right) rejects the notion that Rangers are 'a new club' that will play Celtic for the first time . ‘Of course, people in Holland think of Rangers as the same club. They just think it is sad when they hear of it going into the Third Division. It is sad what happened because we have a lot of Dutch history in the club and they hope it is back soon. ‘I have always known that there is a giant out there in Rangers that is waiting to burst out. There will be good times again, for sure.’ Former manager Alex McLeish went further, insisting: ‘For me Celtic are missing Rangers. You see empty spaces at Celtic Park. Back in the day when Martin O’Neill was there and they had a superb team, we did too. Stadiums were full every week. ‘So Celtic are missing Rangers. A lot of people will probably be trolling me for that but I think a lot of people will agree.’ Rangers manager Alex McLeish believes Celtic are missing the rivalry with Rangers . Ex-midfielder Alex Rae said of the advert: ‘Listen, that’s just provoking things. If that’s what they get their kicks from on the day, maybe it will take away from their performance! ‘Seriously, good luck to them, they can conduct themselves like that if they want. ‘Rangers, over the years, have tried to conduct themselves in the right manner, with a bit of dignity. ‘So it’s not important what they do. What is important is how we conduct ourselves.’ And former defender Bert Konterman said: ‘I have seen the same in Holland at PEC Zwolle, the team I joined as a young lad. ‘When I came in, it was PEC Zwolle, it was FC Zwolle when I played there and the name went back to PEC. The shirt changed a little bit as well, but, overall, it is the same club. It is the same stadium, it is the same history. ‘You can never erase that. No chance. Of course, I feel the same way about Rangers. It is a nice try, but no chance. It is in the heart of the people and that won’t change. Bet Konterman (left) of Rangers in action against Celtic's John Hartson (right) ‘I think it is a bit of sarcasm. It is funny from their side.’ Over 41,000 turned out for yesterday’s benefit match for a visibly ailing Ricksen, McLeish saying: ‘It was great walking out and seeing another powerful moment involving Rangers fans. ‘The noise they could make inside this stadium when it’s full. It’s so difficult to get it through your head Rangers aren’t doing well when you see that support. ‘It’s a brilliant tribute to Fernando, these guys turning out like this a- nd I’ve got to compliment the players turning out for helping a friend who’s having a bad time. ‘He was emotional in the dressing room. He was trying to get things across to you and he was frustrated by that. You could see that. ‘But the boys are very supporting of him and we just want to make everything as comfortable as possible for him. Raising the funds from this game hopefully that can help him.’ Ricksen (centre) is carried by De Boer (left) and Thomas Buffel (right) after the tribute match . Ricksen (centre) lifts the Scottish Premier League trophy as a player for the club in 2005 . An emotional Fernando Ricksen was carried around the stadium at the end of a tribute match at Ibrox . De Boer added: ‘Fernando was so full of spirit and a great fighter as a player and it is very sad when you see him. He is getting worse and worse, but the turnout was incredible and it was great to be back at the club.’ And Konterman said: ‘I last saw Fernando about a year ago before Christmas and he could move and speak much better than now. I was really shocked when I saw him because his hands were cramped, he was struggling with his balance and I can hardly understand him any more. ‘He is going backwards, but what the supporters did for him was unbelievable. They came here to support him and enjoy the old glories. They want to get that back, but that is a different story.’","Celtic fans put an advert in a newspaper saying Rangers are a new club .

"Craig Gordon insists it’s wrong to bill Sunday’s Old Firm game as the most mismatched of all time - and claims Celtic’s chances of reaching the League Cup Final are no more than 50/50. The Scottish champions moved three points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Premiership with a 1-0 victory over Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday, while Rangers, whose caretaker boss Kenny McDowall last week handed in his notice, remain mired in a boardroom crisis and trail Championship leaders Hearts by 13 points. Parkhead striker Anthony Stokes has admitted some fans won’t be satisfied unless Ronny Deila’s men rack up four or five goals against their beleaguered rivals at Hampden. Craig Gordon insists it’s wrong to bill Sunday’s Old Firm game as the most mismatched of all time . But Celtic No 1 Gordon says talk of running up a cricket score is dangerous and misguided. He said: ‘We got by against Ross County with just one goal and that shows you can’t go into any game thinking about how many goals you’re going to score. ‘Is it a 50-50 game? They probably always are 50/50 games, regardless of who’s playing for the two sides. ‘Rangers still have enough quality in their team to win a game so we’ll be looking at ourselves and our preparation. Rangers manager Kenny McDowall, who has handed in his notice, during a training session . ‘The form book goes out the window in Celtic-Rangers matches. There are two sides with 11 men desperate to win the game. And when you have that, anything can happen. ‘You go out in any match intending to win your own individual battles and try to get a victory – whatever the scoreline.’ Former Sunderland and Hearts star Gordon knows the quality of the Rangers squad having spent time training at Murray Park during his long recovery from injury. The 32-year-old was involved in a public spat last November when ex-Rangers boss Ally McCoist claimed he had tried to sign him – a claim the keeper rejected. Celtic's Kris Commons celebrates his goal with team-mates during Saturday's win against Ross County . He also rejects the notion Celtic will be under enormous pressure on Sunday, given they are clear favourites. ‘I don’t feel there is added pressure on us. It’s not just experience Rangers have, but good, quality players, too. So we’ll have to be wary of that, as well as causing our own problems for them. ‘It’s a semi-final and it’s a massive match - but it would be massive regardless.’ Celtic manager Ronny Deila celebrates going three points clear at the top of the Scottish Premier League . Meanwhile, Celtic boss Deila remained coy when asked about a link with Manchester United and Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher on Saturday. He said: ‘There’s nothing new in that matter. He has several [interested clubs] and it is best for me to wait to next Monday to see where we are.’ Celtic also been linked with a move for midfielder Kim Bo-Kyung. They missed out on the South Korea international when Malky Mackay brought him to Cardiff for £5million in 2012 but he has just been released by the Welsh side.","Rangers and Celtic will play each other in the League Cup on Sunday .

"Mike Ashley will not appear at Hampden on Tuesday after it was confirmed a hearing into alleged breaches of 'dual ownership' rules will take place by conference call. It had been rumoured that the Newcastle United owner - who also holds an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers - had been called to appear before the Scottish Football Association's judicial panel. Both the Ibrox club and Ashley were given notices of complaint alleging they had failed to 'act in the best interests' of football. Mike Ashley owns Newcastle United and also holds an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers . But the Scottish Football Association now say that Tuesday's meeting was only ever a 'procedural hearing'. A conference call involving lawyers from the SFA, Rangers and Ashley's camp will take place to discuss a time-scale for the next hearing, when the Sports Direct tycoon will be expected to show. That hearing is likely to be within the next two to four weeks. Ashley signed an agreement with the SFA back in 2012 vowing not to buy up any more than 10 per cent of the Glasgow giants while he remained in charge at St James' Park. Ashley was prevented from raising his holding in the club to up to 30% in December . But Ashley (left) has associate Derek Llambias (right) on the board of Rangers . Hampden chiefs blocked him from increasing his stake to just under 30 per cent last month. But he has been able to take virtual command of the club after handing the Rangers board a £3million emergency loan before placing associates Derek Llambias and Barry Leach onto the Ibrox board. He is now expected to hand the cash-strapped club a further £10million loan ahead of Thursday, when wage payments are due to be made.","Mike Ashley has a hearing on breaches of 'dual ownership' rules .

According to Sunday's edition of Tuttosport, Juve director general Giuseppe Marotta is weighing up a move for PSG's Edinson Cavani in the summer.

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has accused UEFA of lacking the 'courage' to provide a challenge to his leadership, and called on the European governing body to be 'respectful' of his wish to continue in the role. Blatter will be bidding for a fifth term in office at the election in May, with so far only three candidates - French former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne, Prince Ali Bin Hussein of Jordan and former Tottenham winger David Ginola - having declared their intention to stand against him.

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke and England's UEFA vice-president David Gill were last June at the forefront of a European rebellion against Blatter - saying he should not commit a U-turn on his 2011 pledge to stand down in 2015 - despite the incumbent president appearing to have huge support in other continental confederations. Blatter insists he has unfinished business and will not step aside without a fight. 'I have not finished my mission because it's a mission to be in football,' said the Swiss, who launched FIFA's governance reform process in June 2011 at the 61st FIFA Congress in Zurich, shortly after being re-elected for a fourth mandate. Former Tottenham winger David Ginola will stand against Blatter in the upcoming election . 'We have started in 2011 with the reform process. The reform process is not over.' Asked if he was nervous about the upcoming election, he replied: 'No, no. Definitely not. It is impossible to make everybody happy. If I would have only positive press, then it would not be good. And I like criticism as long as the criticism is... I would say fair criticism.' Despite stating his firm intention to continue in his current role, Blatter also outlined plans for his life after FIFA. 'The day I'm going to retire, the first thing I'm going to do is radio,' he said. 'I always said I will do radio. Because radio is even more popular than television, than all electronics. I said one day - this was my boy's wish - to be a radio reporter.' Blatter will be bidding for a fifth term in office at the election in May .","FIFA president Sepp Blatter has criticised UEFA's leaders .

"David Ginola's farcical attempt to depose FIFA president Sepp Blatter has hit a new low with the revelation he faces charges for breaching the governing body’s ethics codes for his links to gambling. That would happen if he becomes an official candidate as of Thursday’s deadline. He would also be left without funding at that stage because his publicity-hungry bookmaker backers Paddy Power, who announced when they ‘launched’ Ginola that he needed £2.3m to run, now say they ‘will not be contributing financially beyond January 27’. Any potential challenger to Blatter to become the most powerful person in the global game after May’s election has until Thursday officially to declare their candidacy, backed by support from five national associations. David Ginola's links to gambling could derail his bid to depose FIFA president Sepp Blatter . FIFA's rules state that all presidential candidates are forbidden from being associated with gambling . But FIFA’s rules governing the presidential race explicitly state that all candidates are bound by the organisation’s code of ethics, which forbids ‘being associated with betting, gambling, lotteries and similar events’. Given that Ginola’s campaign is being run by Paddy Power, who are paying him £250,000 over five months to run, he would be in clear breach of Article 25 of FIFA’s ethics code as a candidate. To make matters worse, the Irish firm are collecting donations from football fans that the campaign website says are non-refundable, for a campaign built around Ginola and run via a new company called Rebooting Football Limited, a subsidiary vehicle of PP set up for the purpose. FIFA’s ethics code also forbids active or passive stakes ‘in companies, concerns, organisations ... that promote [betting]’. It remains unlikely Ginola will get the backing of five FAs and even be able to continue his stunt beyond Thursday. He also faces problems in showing he has held an ‘active’ role in football for two years in the past five years as laid out in condition 13A of the presidential race rules. This specifies candidates should have worked as ‘a board member, committee member, referee, assistant referee, coach, trainer [or] any other person responsible for technical, medical or administrative matters in FIFA, a Confederation, Association, League or Club’. Ginola has claimed that work for England’s ill-fated 2018 World Cup bid and consultancy work for obscure third-tier French club Etoile Frejus Saint-Raphael help him meet the criteria. But his ‘active’ work for the FA covered a few weeks of trips and PR days. And the president of the French club, Alexandre Barbero, has admitted Ginola has held no formal role, has not been paid for work there and has acted as an advisor ‘mainly over the phone’. Ginola has launched a campaign to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA president . Ginola's campaign was announced at a press conference in London on January 16th . Barbero told the Associated Press that Ginola never goes to the club as he does not want to interfere with the coaches’ work there. A spokesman for Paddy Power said: ‘We are happy to engage with FIFA as part of the electoral process and furnish them with any documentation they request in this regard.’ If Ginola did somehow garner the support of five FAs by Thursday, a FIFA election committee would then scrutinise whether he is even eligible to stand — and whether he should face a FIFA ethics charged for his association to gambling. Hundreds of members of the public have donated to his campaign, albeit only a few thousand pounds collectively, and in a contradiction to the the policy on the campaign website, Paddy Power now say: ‘In case David doesn’t make it through, we will look to fully reimburse fans who have donated to the campaign.’ Blatter will be heavy odds-on favourite to keep the presidency and may face just one rival candidate, with Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein of Jordan his likeliest contender. Two former long-term FIFA insiders, Jerome Champagne of France and Harold Mayne-Nichols of Chile, will announce in the coming days whether they have the five FAs they need to support their own bids. Jerome Champagne is expected to announce soon whether he will stand for FIFA presidency . Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein (left) could be the only challenger that Blatter could face (right) Mayne-Nichols was the head of the inspection team that assessed bid nations’ suitability for the past few World Cup hosting races. In an exclusive interview last week in Brussels as he attended a ‘New FIFA Now’ summit to discuss reform, he told The Mail on Sunday that football was betrayed by the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. His own evaluation report warned of the dangers of the heat in the June-July 2022 period nations were bidding for. ‘The weather in Qatar makes it impossible to play in June-July, as it was in the [bidding] contract. It’s impossible,’ he said, adding Qatar should not even have been on the ballot paper for the 22 executive committee members to chose from. ‘I made it very clear that [there was a potential problem with] the health of the players if we play in Qatar,’ he said. ‘High risk. They [ExCo] either took the decision before they read the inspection report, or they read it but didn’t understand.’ After Mayne-Nichols first floated the idea he might challenge Blatter, he himself was hit with an ethics investigation that most observers believe is a trumped-up way to discredit him. Harold Mayne-Nichols (right) of Chile could potentially stand against Blatter . Asked if he thought it was a conspiracy to derail him standing against Blatter, he said: ‘I don’t have the energy to think about that. Otherwise I will lose control of my mind.’ He added that for the public’s confidence in FIFA to be renewed, it is imperative Blatter must go. ‘That’s very clear,’ he says. ‘His period is over. I think he must realise you need new people to get back the confidence of the public. You cannot say I’ve been doing things one way for 41 years [inside FIFA] and now for the next four I’m going to do it this way. Nobody will believe you.’","David Ginola started a campaign to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA president .

"They may have been beaten twice here by Australia already to add to five defeats before Christmas against Sri Lanka but, whisper it, England may just be putting together a one-day team that could exceed expectations at the World Cup. It would still take a giant leap of faith to consider England as realistic contenders but against all previous evidence – and their long run of almost unmitigated 50-over disaster – things just might be alright on the night. Certainly England seem to have stumbled on their best line-up in the nick of time - as they did ahead of winning the World Twenty20 in 2010 - to at least confound the most pessimistic predictions of another dismal World Cup failure. Eoin Morgan has looked impressive since taking over as one-day captain of the England side . Coach Peter Moores, left, believes England's Tri-series form proves they can compete at the World Cup . CLICK HERE to read Paul Newman's report on England's defeat by Australia on Friday. The 11 players who should have got over a psychological hurdle and defeated Australia in Hobart on Friday will almost certainly be the team that takes on a much stronger host nation in the opening World Cup match in Melbourne. And if they keep on showing the improvement which has seen outstanding contributions from Ian Bell, Steven Finn, Moeen Ali, Jimmy Anderson and new captain Eoin Morgan here then they may just be able to go beyond the last eight. England coach Peter Moores was in bullish when England made the long journey to Perth ahead of another date with India at the WACA on Friday and a potential Tri-series final against Australia here next Sunday. ‘The goal here was to try to settle quickly on our side for the World Cup and it feels as though we’re doing that now,’ said Moores. ‘It’s a squad with options and the good thing is we have three or four out of the side fighting to get in it. ‘We desperately want to get to the Tri-series final and we’ve got a big game on Friday. If we get there we feel if we play at the top of our game it will be a really good contest. Australia are a good side, there’s no doubt, but so are we and we’re starting to show that. We can feel ourselves moving in the right direction. Steven Finn, who has had a difficult past two years, has been in excellent form while in Australia . Morgan chats to bowler Finn before he begins an over against India at The Gabba . ‘Anybody who watched the game in Hobart saw an England side score 300 and then say ‘crikey we really should have got more.’ Similarly I think our bowling will only get better. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson are coming back from injury and it’s still early on for them.‘ . It must be said that the big decisions England made ahead of this tour have been vindicated already even if only one Tri-series game in three has been won. The sacking of Alastair Cook may have come late in their grand World Cup plan but Morgan is looking an impressive leader who has even been able to take an attempt to blackmail him over his sex life pretty much in his stride. And the jettisoning of Cook has allowed Ian Bell to emerge from the shadows to justify England’s decision to prefer him at the top of the order ahead of Alex Hales in spectacular fashion, batting as well at the Bellerive Oval in scoring 141 as he can ever have done in limited-overs cricket. Most promisingly, Finn is starting to again look like the one-day bowler who was almost unplayable in New Zealand two years ago having battled back from a collapse in his action during last year’s traumatic Ashes tour so severe that his international and even county future was in doubt. ‘The whole dressing room and everybody associated with it were really pleased with Finny’s performance at the Gabba,’ said Moores of Finn’s five-wicket haul against India. ‘He has had a tough time and has worked hard to get back. I was equally pleased last night because backing that up is difficult. Ian Bell has been excellent since being given the nod over Alex Hales at the top of the order . Bell celebrates after reaching his century, he eventually scored 141 at the Bellerive Oval against Australia . ‘He came on at a tough time to bowl and he ran in, got the ball reversing and picked up a couple of wickets. He had that bounce back in how he did everything. I think it’s fantastic. He’s a very good performer, we know he’s got a great record and credit to someone who’s put in a lot of hard work. ‘It would be a huge boost for us if he gets back to where he was a couple of years ago. Steven’s gone through quite a journey and he’s got to the point where he just wants to go and enjoy his cricket. He’s in a good place.’ When England lost one-day series to both Sri Lanka and India last summer and then got thrashed in Sri Lanka they looked a million miles from a side capable of the modern, dynamic one-day cricket other nations are playing. Now, three weeks from the World Cup, it is possible to start to get ever so slightly optimistic. ‘I said when I took over that it was our job to try to get the best 15 players on the plane for the World Cup,’ said Moores. ‘Alastair didn’t get on that plane and everybody felt for him but it just felt like the right time to do it. Without a shadow of doubt there’s still time for us to compete with the best sides at this World Cup. You don’t get more than 300 in three out of five games here so far without playing well. ‘There’s lots of things going round in our team and I think they’re starting to fit together. We want to keep it simple, get a settled side and enjoy playing. We’re representing our country, I think we’ve got the best 15 players we could and now we need to get stuck in and work hard to win some games.’ Moores felt it was the 'right time' to drop former captain Alastair Cook .","England lost to Australia in their Tri-series clash on Friday .

"Sampdoria are optimistic that Samuel Eto'o will join them this month despite late interest from New York Cosmos.

Aston Villa have fended off interest from Bayern Munich and Liverpool to secure Easah Suliman. The 16-year-old signed scholarship forms with Villa in the summer but has still been courted by bigger clubs as they looked to tempt the England Under 17 defender away from Villa Park.

"Christian Benteke will not be sold by Aston Villa even if a bid of £25million comes in for the Belgium striker, Paul Lambert has insisted. The Villa manager is adamant Benteke will stay to aid his low-scoring side’s fight against relegation – even with owner Randy Lerner open to selling the club. Benteke is Villa’s most prized asset and has been a target for Tottenham and Liverpool. Christian Benteke, who has struggled to find the net this season, won't be sold by Aston Villa this month . Asked if he was worried Lerner might accept a big offer this window, Lambert said: 'No chance.' He added: 'Twenty-five million? That’s for his left boot that one. Listen, there is no way and I am pretty sure Randy will be totally fine.' Benteke has only scored three times in 15 games this season after missing six months with a ruptured achilles, but remains one of the Premier League’s most-wanted centre-forwards. Top-six clubs are expected to explore the possibility of luring him away from Villa Park this summer. Villa boss Paul Lambert (left) reacts during the 2-0 defeat by Liverpool last Saturday . Benteke, who has scored jut three goals this season, sees a shot against Liverpool saved by Simon Mignolet . The 24-year-old, signed for £7m from Genk in 2012, remains vital to Villa’s ambitions of staying up. The team have only found the net 11 times in 22 Premier League games. Lambert said he was looking at the bringing in another striker this month but laughed off any suggestion Villa had countenanced Jermain Defoe, whose £80,000-per-week wages are far beyond their pay scale. ‘A top, top striker in football now you are talking, £10m, £15m-plus,’ said Lambert. 'I knew we weren’t going to do these sort of things. I had to respect Randy’s way and there is no problem – that is the way the club is.' Libor Kozak, in action against Crystal Palace in December 2013, has been recovering from a broken leg . Libor Kozak was bought for £6m in 2013 to support Benteke but has been out for a year with a broken leg. Lambert was unable to say whether the Czech Republic international, who has experienced setbacks in his recovery, would play again this season. 'He is running. We need to sit and discuss [moving on to ball work] but for the horrific break it was, he is doing well,’ said Lambert.

It was a relief for the champions after their star man Zlatan Ibrahimovic had been largely responsible for their poor start.

Villa boss Paul Lambert insists there is 'no chance' of Benteke leaving the club in this current window . Fellow striker Libor Kozak has been out for a year since breaking his leg and Villa failed to bring in any cover in the summer.

He said: 'Even if you go for a top, top striker in football now you are talking, £10million to £15million-plus. Christian has been my biggest signing and he was millions of euros. Now he is probably, on his game, one of the best strikers in Europe. 'I knew the situation at the club, I knew we weren't going to do these sort of things.

Kozak, a £7million signing from Lazio in 2013, could return before the end of the season but Lambert is cautious after the 25-year-old's lengthy lay-off. 'Libor has been an absolute disaster with his leg break, he's been a nightmare. He is doing really well actually, he is coming back at the beginning for next week,' he said. 'His rehab has gone really well and he's still got a wee bit of the way to go but he is getting there. He is running.

"Defending champion Sergio Garcia kicks off his return to action in 2015 in Doha, a place where he feels particularly at home. The Spaniard has recorded top-10 finishes in his last four appearances at the Qatar Masters, which includes a runners-up spot in 2013. He is a combined 46 under for his last 16 rounds at the Doha Golf Club and it is clearly a course he enjoys playing which culminated an a epic play-off victory over Finland's Mikko Ilonen 12 months ago. Sergio Garcia takes part in the pro-am event prior to the start of the Qatar Masters in Doha . Garcia won a dramatic play-off against Mikko Ilonen last year to win his first Qatar Masters title . The Spaniard has finished inside the top 10 on his last four visits to the Qatar Masters . 'I have been quite fortunate to do well here for most of the years I've played,' said Garcia, who is looking to become the first champion to successfully defend his title. 'I came close to winning a few times, so it was nice to get over the line last year. 'Two years ago I was close to winning, one shot back, and last year it finally happened so I'm excited to continue the trend. 'I want to play as well as I can and put up a good defence of my title. 'I've started my season in Qatar for the last few years, and I always enjoy coming back. 'I have some good memories and hopefully they can inspire me to have another successful week.' Last week in Abu Dhabi much of the pre-tournament talk was about world number one Rory McIlroy's habit of writing his aims for the year on the back of his airline boarding ticket ahead of his first tournament of the year. Garcia plays a delicate chip shot onto the green at Doha golf club on Tuesday afternoon . South Africa's Ernie Els knocks a drive down a fairway during the pro-am event at Doha golf club . Henrik Stenson plays an approach to a green as he warms up for the start of the Qatar Masters . Garcia, who had 11 top-10 finishes on the 2014 schedule, has no such ritual. 'I try to do the best I can every single week I play,' he told European Tour Radio. 'I try to improve every year and be consistent and my goal is to keep going in the same direction from last year.' Another player more than happy in the Middle East is world number two Henrik Stenson, whose four wins in the region tie him with Ernie Els for most European Tour titles in the region. 'It has been a good hunting ground - I guess I've figured out a decent way to play the course, and I've done some good scores over the years in windy conditions, as well,' said the Swede, who goes out with Els and Garcia in the opening rounds having missed the cut in Abu Dhabi last week in his first appearance of the year. 'I've got a strong pairing with Ernie, second week now playing with Ernie, and Sergio is back in action, so we'll have good fun out there. It's a good group, so looking forward to it.

David Luiz was voted into the defense despite playing in Brazil's 7-1 rout by Germany in the World Cup semifinals, when Thiago Silva was suspended. Still, the Brazilian pair was reunited for a second embarrassing loss, 3-0 against the Netherlands in the third-place match. Arjen Robben was picked as the only player from the Dutch team which started the World Cup by routing title holder Spain 5-1.

"Peter Dawson’s last major decision as chief executive of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club before he retires in September is likely to be his most far-reaching of all. Brace yourself for the distinct possibility that at the start of next month he will announce live coverage of the Open Championship, from 2016 onwards, will be shown only on Sky. Even now, the natural instinct is to believe the R&A will pull back from the brink and The Open will still be live on the BBC, if only over the weekend. They couldn’t take the biggest tournament in the sport away from the biggest audience, could they? Yet, few insiders in Abu Dhabi last week believed that will prove the outcome. Rory McIlroy kisses the Claret Jug after his two-stroke victory at the 2014 Open Championship . Once upon a time the BBC showed more than 30 days of live golf each year but it looks as if, to all intents and purposes, they are all but done. If so, it’s devastating news for the future of the game in this country. Is it merely coincidence that participation levels have plummeted in tandem with the BBC’s retreat from showing the game on our screens? Clubs are closing up and down the country. Councils with budgets under pressure are wondering why they should continue to pour resources into municipal courses. True, there are plenty of other reasons for this sad state of affairs, like the game takes too long for working men and women under 50, with young kids of their own to consider. But it would be naive not to believe there’s some correlation between the lack of golf on terrestrial television and the decline in numbers taking up the game. Let’s say at this point, this is not a dig at Sky. They do a tremendous job if you’re a golf aficionado, with their comprehensive coverage of the European and PGA Tours. You might even be pleased if they snap up The Open, with their superior camera production values. McIlory's triumph was available for all to see on BBC, but that all may change with the rumoured new TV deal . It’s the casual fans we are thinking about here, and the impressionable teenage lovers of sport who watch all games and are still seeking out their favourite. How on earth is the game going to appeal to this latter group if it’s never on free-to-air TV? Think of Sir Nick Faldo. Channel-hopping late at night several decades ago, this then keen cyclist with no interest in golf came across the Masters — and look how that ended up. The R&A’s professed mandate is to grow the game but it’s hard to see how taking live coverage from the BBC squares with that. Could they not do a similar deal like the one with the Masters, whereby they share live coverage at the weekend? I understand there’s little enthusiasm at Sky for such an arrangement. Not unreasonably, if they’re giving the R&A a huge pot of gold, they want exclusive live rights. Undoubtedly, heads were turned at the R&A in 2013 when the United States Golf Association, their American equivalent, took the US Open away from its traditional broadcast partner and gave it to the relative newcomer, Fox, in a deal worth £800million over 12 years. At 13 years of age, Sir Nick Faldo was inspired to play golf while watching the 1971 Masters on television . But the differences are marked. Fox is still a free-to-air television channel and, in any case, the game is shown every weekend on such television stations in America. It doesn’t need any more exposure. Will the R&A break with more than a half-century of tradition? We will find out soon enough. But let’s hope that, even at this 11th hour, they move back from the precipice. To think, the announcement might even come at the same time as the world No 1 Rory McIlroy is in the witness stand in a Dublin courtroom, where some sharp lawyers will be trawling his financial affairs through the mud. Apologies for coming over all doom-laden following the dramatic start to the season in Abu Dhabi last week. But the early days of February are shaping up to be bleak indeed for the Royal and Ancient game. Darren Clarke is favourite to be appointed Europe’s Ryder Cup captain in mid-February . Not long to wait now until Darren Clarke is appointed Europe’s Ryder Cup captain. The five-man committee that will choose Paul McGinley’s successor are due to meet in mid-February, with an announcement expected the same evening. Given Clarke has the backing of all the leading players it is inconceivable the committee would overlook such unanimity and bestow the honour on someone else. As one of the great characters of the European game over the past 20 years and a formidable Ryder Cup player in the past, Clarke deserves his chance, too. QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘Ball-striking, I don’t think I could have done much more. I exceeded my own expectations in that regard, so it all bodes well for the new season.’ Rory McIlroy, after a runner-up finish in Abu Dhabi left him with this record from his last six European Tour starts: 1,1,1,2,2,2.

"More than 1,000 mourners clogged Brussels' main basilica to pay their last respects on Tuesday to Belgium youth international and Wolfsburg midfielder Junior Malanda, who died in a car crash last week. Among the attendees, many of whom wore Wolfsburg colors, were Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking and manager Klaus Allofs. Malanda was a back-seat passenger when the driver of the SUV lost control and the vehicle skidded off a slippery highway 10 days ago and overturned several times. Malanda, aged 20, was pronounced dead on the spot. VIDEO Bendtner and Wolfsburg team-mates attend Junior Malanda's funeral .

"Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is happy on Merseyside but both the club and the player need to adapt to the needs of the other, according to the Italian's agent Mino Raiola. Balotelli was left out of the Reds squad on Saturday as Liverpool drew 0-0 with Bolton at home in the FA Cup fourth round. However, Raiola believes the 24-year-old will return to the Liverpool team 'stronger than ever'. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is happy at Anfield, according to the Italian's agent Mino Raiola . Dejan Lovren (left) posted an Instagram picture of him and Balotelli on the train to London on Monday . Speaking to Sky Sports News HQ, Balotelli's agent said: 'Yes, he is happy at Liverpool. Nobody is happy to be left out but he reacted in a professional way.' Balotelli - who was signed following Luis Suarez's departure to Barcelona after the Uruguayan scored 31 Premier League goals last term - has failed to find the net in the top-flight since his £16million summer arrival from AC Milan. However, Raiola insists Liverpool need to be aware that Balotelli is a different player to Suarez and that both parties need to adapt to the needs of the other. Balotelli has failed to score for Liverpool in the Premier League since his summer switch from AC Milan . 'They are different players. Liverpool knew that and people need to know he is not Suarez. Mario needs to adapt and Liverpool need to adapt,' he added. Despite Balotelli's struggles this season, Raiola says the frontman will not be leaving Anfield this month. 'We didn't ask to leave,' he said. 'It is too early, with the injury, to say we leave in January. There are no big problems. He's adapting to a new style that the manager wants. We'll see in the summer.'","Mario Balotelli was left out of Liverpool's FA Cup draw against Bolton .

"Louis van Gaal left the John Ruddy Suite with a derisory chuckle. No, he did not regret giving Wayne Rooney a breather and he could not believe anyone had the temerity to suggest that might actually be the case. Rooney has played 25 times this season and had not scored since Boxing Day. ‘I gave him and Juan Mata a rest, just like I did with Michael Carrick and Robin van Persie at Yeovil,’ said Van Gaal, before the Manchester United manager departed the makeshift media room at the R Costings Abbey Stadium, tutting and shaking his head. ‘I am not regretting it.’ The Dutchman’s expensively-assembled team had just been held by Cambridge United, recently returned to the Football League after a nine-year exile and mid-table in League Two with a side patched together from free transfers, academy products and loan recruits. Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after Manchester United's draw with Cambridge United . Van Gaal walks from the pitch at full time frustrated after his side drew 0-0 against Cambridge United . BBC TV rights . £140,000 . Home gate receipts . £100,000 . Prize money . £67,500* . Replay gate receipts . £1.3m . *based on fourth-round exit . ‘We have an extra match, but we are still in the Cup, that’s the most important thing,’ said Van Gaal. Cambridge would enjoy a long night as they celebrated the 0-0 draw and a fourth round replay at Old Trafford worth up to £1.75million — on top of the £250,000 from the original tie, which was watched by more than seven million viewers on BBC One. Manchester United returned north, safe in the knowledge they were still in the FA Cup and unlikely to fail in the replay, but with issues still to iron out. Issues such as how to get misfiring striker Radamel Falcao into the groove, where to get the best from Angel di Maria and whether anyone other than Phil Jones might be capable of taking the corners. United have sounded out French champions Paris Saint-Germain ahead of a possible summer move for the stylish Marquinhos, but they have been warned the defender will not come cheap. Angel di Maria struggled to impress for Manchester United against Cambridge United . Radamel Falcao had a another frustrating night in a Manchester United shirt against Cambridge . The 20-year-old central defender joined PSG 18 months ago from Roma in a £23.4million deal but has found himself playing at right-back to accommodate the arrival of David Luiz this season. United value Marquinhos at around £30m but PSG have laughed off those figures. His agent Giuliano Bertolucci said: ‘Last summer, PSG’s president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declared that Marquinhos was unsellable. We will see what their position is this summer. Many clubs are interested in the player. Manchester United are one of them, this is true.’ Cambridge players rubbed in a little salt, claiming they had not been overawed and did not feel uncomfortable during Friday’s tie. Cameron McGeehan (left) of Cambridge United  tackles Michael Carrick of Manchester United . Man-of-the-match Ryan Donaldson and team-mate Tom Champion celebrating at full time . ‘We were under the cosh for almost all the second half but we’ve got a good resilience about us in the squad and I didn’t feel we were in too much trouble,’ said their former Newcastle midfielder Ryan Donaldson. ‘They had a couple of chances, but I thought we were reasonably comfortable. We deserved a draw, definitely. ‘We found a bit of space in the first half and passed it quite well. There were a few gaps we managed to exploit. We won a few set-pieces and came really close on one, with Josh Coulson. ‘If that had gone in, who knows what would’ve happened. But we can’t complain too much. To be go-ing up there as a Cambridge player is incredible. If you’d told me that when I signed 18 months ago, I’d have laughed in your face, but it’s happening and we’ll enjoy it.’ Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney was rested for the trip to Cambridge on Friday . As was midfielder Juan Mata, who is expected to return to the fold ahead of the Premier League next week . The journey for Cambridge captain Tom Champion has been in the opposite direction, having climbed through non-League football. ‘I definitely came the hard way,’ said 28-year-old. ‘Thinking back to the days when I worked in an office nine-to-five is surreal. We can take a lot of pride from getting the club here, doing ourselves justice. ‘We knew the longer it stayed 0-0, the more frustrated they’d get. In the second half, we knew we’d be without the ball for much longer periods. We had to defend well. ‘When you see the firepower they ended up with — Van Persie, Falcao, Di Maria — the boys can be proud and there’s a big reward to come up at Old Trafford.’","Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were disappointing in Cambridge draw .

"Lionel Messi gave Barcelona the narrowest of first-leg leads over Atletico Madrid in their Copa del Rey quarter-final on Wednesday night. With stalemate looming Barcelona were awarded penalty four minutes from time and, although the Argentine saw his spot kick saved, he rammed home the rebound to give his team the edge ahead of next week’s second leg. After a cautious start to the game from both sides, Neymar was the first to go close - forcing a save from Jan Oblak. Alongside the Brazilian, Luis Suarez was occupying Uruguayan team-mate Diego Godin and Messi was loitering with intent on the right wing, making a fool of left-back Siqueira whenever he could.

Bookings: Juanfran, Gabi Godin . On one foray into a more central position the Argentine almost scored Barcelona’s first. Rakitic's cross was slammed at him at uncontrollable speed but he still killed it dead and got his shot away just over Oblak’s bar. Alves found Suarez with an equally-awkward pass but the former Liverpool striker couldn’t quite control the ball with Godin in close attendance. Atletico were not offering too much going forward - but they were forcing set-pieces and corners. Arda Turan went down after being challenged by Rakitic and was struggling to walk when he got back to his feet but he recovered immediately when the rebound from the subsequent free-kick came out to him and he fired it straight back at Marc-Andre Ter Stegen. Torres was being jeered at every turn. His eight goals in 12 games record against Barca made him a threat but his aim was off in the first half, shooting through Pique’s legs out for a corner and running into the same defender when a misplaced pass from Sergio Busquets played him through. The other former Liverpool striker - Suarez - was having no more luck. He was hacked down from behind by Godin and the referee waved play-on. To add to his frustration he was then gifted Barca’s best chance of the half from a Rakitic pass but blazed over from the edge of the six-yard box. His name rang around the stadium as supporters did their best to get behind him but the frustration was palpable. Torres went from Pique’s pocket to the bench for the re-start as Mario Mandzukic came on for the second half. Andres Iniesta had Barcelona’s first chance of the second period but, played in by Neymar, his shot was blocked and sailed into Oblak’s arms.

Suarez missed a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock when he skied his shot over the bar from six yards . For Atletico, Mandzukic was having little effect - back-heeling one ball straight out of play - but defensively they were airtight, offering no space to Barcelona’s front three. Suarez went down under Godin’s challenge on the edge of the area but his appeals for a spot-kick were waved away. He was then booked for appealing for handball from Raul Garcia as the midfielder intercepted his pass to Messi with his arm. Referee Jose Luis Gonzalez Gonzalez was endearing himself to no-one inside the Camp Nou until minute No 86 when he pointed to the spot after Busquets took a tumble. First he gave a free-kick after Siqueira went through the back of Messi. Then the Argentine’s free-kick was charged down but, in the subsequent melee, Juanfran kicked Busquets and the referee gave a penalty. Messi’s spot-kick was saved but he calmly tapped in the rebound to settle the first leg.

"For Rafael Nadal the Rod Laver Arena, centre court of the Australian Open, might be better named the House of Pain. Exhausting marathons, knee and back injuries, retirements, shattering defeats and now cramps in his stomach and elsewhere. He has been through them all there, apart from when winning the title in 2009. VIDEO  Australian Open: Rafa Nadal wins 2-6 6-3 7-6 3-6 5-7 vs Tim Smyczek . Rafael Nadal had to dig deep to overcome illness and poor form in order to defeat Tim Smyczek . The Spaniard slumped to his knees after winning match point after a gruelling four hour eight minute battle . It is hard to see him replicating that triumph this time around, the evidence coming in his dramatic 6-2, 3-6, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5 win over little-known American Tim Smyczek. For long spells it seemed the world No 112 was going to remove Andy Murray’s potential semi-final opponent, assuming the British player survives his coming third round against Portugal’s Joao Sousa. Nadal has banked precious little in the way of wins or confidence since Wimbledon last year. That was a major factor in the physical difficulties which he just about overcame to see off a player who was beaten by GB No 4 Liam Broady in his usual Challenger circuit environment less than three months ago. He referred to cramps in different parts of his body as the reason for his undulating performance, against an albeit inspired opponent. ‘I was suffering,’ he said. What is sure is that Nadal’s warrior fighting instinct has survived his long lay-off, although he cannot have felt the cramps for a sustained period as it is simply not possible to play tennis of this intensity over a match of nearly four and a quarter hours if you are continually ill. Nadal required attention from the doctors during the second set after complaining of feeling weak . Clearly suffering, it looked as though Nadal may crash out but he rallied to win in five sets . Before Murray can contemplate any semi-final, he must overcome the speedy Sousa, who has an unlikely connection with Jose Mourinho. Sousa is the Chelsea manager’s relatively humble stablemate in the management group controlled by ‘Super Agent’ Jorge Mendes, who also looks after Cristiano Ronaldo. But so far removed from Mendes’ star clients is Sousa that he has never even met Mourinho, unlike Murray, who has done rehab work at their Cobham facility and consulted him privately several times about how to handle the pressure of top-level sport. Sousa, the world No 55, is under no illusions about his own status. ‘I have never called myself the Special One, not even close,’ he said. Mourinho turned up at the O2 Arena in November, only to see Murray hammered by Roger Federer at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. But Sousa has not got that close. ‘I haven’t had the honour of meeting him but he is one of the greatest professionals in sport. I hope to meet him one day,’ he said. Nadal leans over a sponsor board to clear his throat as he struggled with illness during the match . American qualifier Smyczek, more used to the Challenger circuit, pushed Nadal all the way in Melbourne . Nadal will play Israel's Dudi Sela in the third round after making it safely through . Murray made it through with an extremely comfortable 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 win over Australia’s Marinko Matosevic. Also through is Roger Federer, who was bitten by something on the tip of the small finger of his right hand, causing some slight swelling. He was still able to beat Italian Simone Bolelli 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Murray’s biggest irritation since being here has been being woken at 6am last week for a random blood test which was ordered by UK anti-doping. He stressed, though, that he was in favour of the increased testing taking place in tennis through its biological passport programme. ‘It was 6am a few days before a major. What time is unreasonable?’ he asked. ‘But they need to do it, definitely more. I think everyone is getting tested here when they lose, so for me it would be three tests in two weeks or so, a lot more than it used to be.’ You would expect him to get past Sousa to set up a possible fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov. When they played in the second round here two years ago, Sousa only managed to win eight games. Murray has a record against Australians that England’s touring cricketers would love to emulate, leading them 10-0 over the course of his career. And Matosevic spoke very highly of the Scot’s form. ‘That’s the best Andy’s played against me,’ he said. ‘He was good at the French when he beat me and went on to the semis, at Queen’s when he went on to win there and then Wimbledon, but this was pretty impressive. ‘He can go all the way. He has a tough passage in the second week with Federer, Nadal, but he can win it.","Rafael Nadal beat Tim Smyzcek 6-2 3-6 6-7 6-3 7-5 in Melbourne .

"Manchester City’s new £28million striker Wilfried Bony was unable to inspire his country to victory in their first game at the Africa Cup of Nations, as 10-man Ivory Coast came from behind to draw with Guinea. Alongside his new City team-mate Yaya Toure, Bony was practically anonymous for much of the game as the Elephants were almost embarrassed by the minnows - although he did manage to provide a crucial assist for Seydou Doumbia to level the scores. Mohamed Yattara scored Guinea’s opener before half-time, capitalising on some woeful Kolo Toure defending, before Gervinho made his side’s job all the more difficult by stupidly pushing Naby Ketia in the face to earn a red card.

Subs not used: Zayatte, Landel, Sylla, Cisse, Camara, Keita, Soumah, Kamano, Diarra, Camara, Paye . Goal: Yattara 36 . But despite the man advantage Guinea were unable to hold on, Bony finally springing to life 20 minutes from time to control a lofted pass and lay it inside to CSKA’s Doumbia, who finished with aplomb. And the former Swansea man could have scored a winner moments later, but his near-post flick from a Serge Aurier cross was blocked by a defender. The result was harsh on Guinea, perhaps the tournament’s least-fancied side, who were impressive right from the off. It is remarkable that they are in Equatorial Guinea at all - having been forced to play their ‘home’ qualifiers in Morocco because of the Ebola crisis, they somehow made it through. And in the first half they looked dangerous at times, wingers Ibrahima Conte and Ibrahima Traore causing the Ivorian full-backs problems. The Ivorian defence - which conceded 11 times in six qualification games, featured Eric Bailly and Serge Kanon, both making their competitive international debuts - looked decidedly nervous long before the errors that led to Yattara’s opener. The goal itself was a shocking display of defending for an international team. First Aurier allowed a Guinea attack to gain momentum, watching Conte cruise past him to run at Kolo Toure.

As the former Arsenal forward swings, he catches his opposition player, who then falls to the ground . The referee brandishes a red card to Gervinho, who immediately falls to the ground in disbelief at the decision . Then, when the ball came into the box, Toure’s defensive header was appalling, dropping the ball into the danger zone for Yattara to smash home on the volley. The star-studded Ivorian side, with the likes of Premier League stars Bony, Tiote and both Toures making up the spine of the team - and former top flight wingers Gervinho and Salomon Kalou flanking them - ought to have been more threatening, but could only show flashes of their potential. Gervinho was the most dangerous of the front four, going on several dangerous dribbles, one of which ended with a brilliant save from Naby Yattara in the Guinea goal. Leaving two defenders in his wake the Roma winger squared to Bony instead of going alone. City’s new signing scuffed his shot straight back to the winger, who was denied only by a stunning stop from Yattara, pushing the ball onto the underside of the bar.

"Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford could yet be back in the Premier League with Middlesbrough after helping fire them into an automatic-promotion place. The 21-year-old harbours ambition of returning to Stamford Bridge as part of Jose Mourinho’s senior set-up next season. But given Bamford’s tender years and the likes of Diego Costa, Loic Remy and Didier Drogba ahead of him in the pecking order, Boro boss Aitor Karanka could well use his friendship with Mourinho to secure the striker for another season should they win promotion. Middlesbrough centre forward Patrick Bamford is overjoyed after he opens the scoring in the 63rd minute . Bamford races away to celebrate after he broke the deadlock at the Riverside Stadium . Lee Tomlin (second right) celebrates after he doubles Boro's advantage in the 79th minute . ‘I was very pleased when Patrick extended his loan here (on January 1). He looks a better player every day,’ said the former Real Madrid assistant manager. ‘He is more mature. He takes more responsibility. It was important for Patrick to score tonight (after six games without a goal).’ Karanka’s side travel to Manchester City in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday but, Bamford apart, there was little to worry the team who also sit second in the Premier League. The Teessiders have struggled for goals in recent weeks and that much was apparent during the first half. Middlesbrough goalkeeper Dimi Konstanopoulos competes for the ball with Cardiff's Alex Revell . Cardiff's Kaddem Harris (centre) controls the ball under pressure from Boro's Adam Clayton (right) Tomlin (left) gets down low to clear the ball as Peter Whittingham attempts a shot for Cardiff . The best chance was fashioned after just 30 seconds, Bamford escaping down the right and drawing back for Kike, unmarked on the edge of the area. A heavy first touch robbed the Spaniard of space and the resulting snap shot was blocked by the sliding Ben Turner. That excitement was not a sign of things to come. Just before the break Bamford drilled wide from 30 yards and that was as close as either side came to an opener. But the England Under-21 star got his goal on 63 minutes. Adam Reach scampered down the left and centred for Bamford and, when his first effort was blocked, he seized on the loose ball before smashing home. Cardiff winger Craig Noone gets a shot away during a tense first-half of action at the Riverside Stadium . Substitute Albert Adomah had the chance to put the game to bed when freed by Bamford but his low blast was smothered by Moore. However, Lee Tomlin was to make no mistake on 79 minutes with Reach again the provider from the left, the striker accepting the invitation of a side-footed finish from close range. There was a late scare when former Sunderland forward Kenwyne Jones headed a response for the visitors but Boro held on to move within one point of leaders Bournemouth after their surprise defeat at Leeds.","Patrick Bamford fired Middlesbrough into the lead in the 63rd minute .

The 31-year-old didn't fully take part in the national team's first two practices at their Equatorial Guinea base, due to fatigue following a busy schedule with Manchester City. However, the Ivory Coast captain trained on Monday allaying fears he would be unavailable for Tuesday's Group D encounter. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Toure and  Bony train ahead of Ivory Coast vs Guinea . Ivory Coast captain Yaya Toure has declared himself fit to play against Guinea in Tuesday's Group D opener . Toure (left) took part in training with the Ivory Coast on Monday ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations match . The 31-year-old had been a doubt for the match after missing Ivory Coast's previous two training sessions . No player has assisted more goals at The African Cup of Nations since 2010 than Yaya Toure (four, level with John Obi Mikel.) Toure goes into this fixture having scored in six of his last eight league games for club side Manchester City. Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony was the top-scoring Premier League player in 2014 with 20 goals, while Toure was third with 17. The Elephants have won nine and lost none of their last 11 Africa Cup of Nations group games, though they have not won the trophy since 1992. The one previous meeting between these sides in this competition saw Ivory Coast win 5-0; Salomon Kalou bagged a brace in that game in 2008. Guinea have gone eight games without a clean sheet in this tournament. 'At the moment, I'm good. It's just a case of being careful,' Toure said. 'I've been in a lot of games in the Premier League.' Elephants coach Herve Renard concurred with his captain's sentiments adding that his absence has been a precautionary measure to ensure the midfielder is fresh. 'He has played a lot, notably between Christmas and New Year, for Manchester [City] and the most important thing is Tuesday,' Renard said. Renard's side go into the tournament as one of the strong favourites to win the competition - with the likes of Kolo Toure, Wilfried Bony and Gervinho all on hand to play a pivotal role in their progression. The Ivorians are without former captain Didier Drogba, who retired from international duty in August, but his successor Yaya Toure firmly believes the squad can finally live up to their potential by winning the competition for the first time in 23 years. 'We have been chasing this trophy for a few years now, and we've not got it,' he told Goal. 'This year it's time again to try to do it and I hope that at long last we have it in us. We can do it. I am fighting for it.' Premier League stars Wilfried Bony (left) and Kolo Toure both also took part in Monday's training session .

"Roger Federer eased into the second round of the Australian Open on Monday with a straight-sets victory over Yen-Hsun Lu, win No 1,001 of his amazing career. Seeking his 18th grand slam title and first in Melbourne since 2010, Federer was in complete command against the world No 47, winning 6-4, 6-2, 7-5 in one hour and 53 minutes on Rod Laver Arena. The 33-year-old fired nine aces and won 86 per cent of points on his first serve and will face Simone Bolelli in the last 64 after the Italian defeated Argentina's Juan Monaco in four sets . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Australian Open: Roger Federer wins 6-4 6-2 7-5 vs Yen Hsun . Roger Federer eased into the second round on his 16th appearance at the Australian Open . Federer made a good start to his campaign, beating Lu Yen-Hsun in straight sets in Melbourne . Federer signs autographs for fans after making a strong start to his Australian Open campaign . 'I thought it was a really good level,' Federer said. 'Lu played a tough match and I really had to step it up. I've played him before so knew what he was capable of. 'The season is still early and it's tough to get rhythm, especially in the first round but it was a nice match.' Federer, who recorded his 1,000th win in the final of the Brisbane International earlier this month, has never lost in the first round of the Australian Open and there was never any danger of that record being broken. One break of serve was enough to secure the opening set and two more gave him the second, although the second seed did have to save two break points when serving at 5-2. There were a few signs of frustration from Federer as he battled to gain another break in the third set, the Swiss star having to wait until the 11th game to end Lu's brave resistance.

"Despicable, Gary Neville called it. Jamie Carragher said it was 'selfish'; Roberto Martinez's description of choice, meanwhile, was 'unfortunate'. Whatever adjective you wanted to go for, there was no disputing the impact of Kevin Mirallas' actions in the 43rd minute of this unremarkable Barclays Premier League encounter. Putting himself ahead of his team, he has cranked up the tension and pressure on Everton's floundering campaign. Everton versus West Bromwich Albion was never a fixture that looked like entering the vaults of football gold but it ended up producing one of the season's most controversial moments. Martinez may have tried to defuse it but do not underestimate the ramifications. Kevin Mirallas missed a penalty as Everton and West Brom played out a goalless draw at Goodison Park on Monday . Mirallas and Leighton Baines debated over who should take the penalty as a result of Lescott's handball . Everton: Robles 7, Coleman 6.5, Stones 7, Jagielka 7, Baines 7, Besic 8 (Kone 79), Barry 6.5, Naismith 6, Barkley 6, Mirallas 6 (Oviedo 46, 6), Lukaku 6. Subs Not Used: Hibbert, Garbutt, Alcaraz, McAleny, Griffiths. Booked: Barry, Oviedo, Besic. West Brom: Foster 8, Wisdom 7, McAuley 7, Lescott 6.5, Baird 6, Brunt 6, Yacob 6, Morrison 6 (Sessegnon 65), Gardner 6, Berahino 5 (Dorrans 70), Anichebe 5 (Ideye 79). Subs Not Used: Myhill, Pocognoli, Dawson, Samaras. Booked: Morrison, Dorrans. Att: 34,739 . Ref: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Muhamed Besic covered a lot of ground (as his heat map above shows) before being replaced in the 79th minute by Arouna Kone - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE FROM GOODISON PARK . It all started when Seamus Coleman hoisted in a cross. Romelu Lukaku chested the ball down and, as it bounced up, Joleon Lescott handled. Referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation pointing to the penalty spot, waving away the token West Brom appeals. Usually in such circumstances, Leighton Baines steps up, picks his spot then smashes his drive unerringly into the net. This time, however, Mirallas was set on the glory, ignoring Lukaku's attempts to take the ball off him and give it to the England international. Steven Naismith also stepped in, imploring Mirallas to 'give it to Bainesy'. He didn't. Baines had the final say, repeatedly asking Mirallas whether he was sure he wanted to take it. So he did. And he missed. And the growls and groans began sweeping around Goodison Park. This was farce. West Brom defender Joleon Lescott handled the ball to give Everton a penalty just before half-time at Goodison Park . Baines appeared to back away and let Mirallas take the penalty as he patted the Belgian forward on the head . 'If Leighton Baines wants to take the penalty, he takes the penalty,' Martinez argued after a 0-0 draw that stretches his team's wretched run to one win in 13 games in all competitions. 'We are making an issue about a penalty taker who misses the penalty. 'It makes it a big issue but if he hits the back of the net, nothing would happen. We are a team that is very much together. If we had played this game 10 times, we would have had nine wins. The disappointment is that we can't finish the penalty. Of course I am disappointed.' So much for the Hollywood ending: they were filming for Sylvester Stallone's latest blockbuster at Goodison Park on Monday night but, instead, they had to sit through a raspberry; not even a message from Stallone, broadcast on the big screens, could lift the mood. The Belgian dragged his penalty wide of Ben Foster's goal as the game remained goalless going into the half-time interval . Mirallas watches his penalty clip the outside of the post beyond the outstretched arm of West Brom goalkeeper Foster . Cameras were on the pitch at half-time to shoot some crowd scenes for his latest Rocky-based project, 'Creed', but try as they did to rouse themselves, the home supporters were baffled by what had gone on. They knew chances were going to be scarce, that failures would be costly. Though Martinez has experienced relegation with Wigan Athletic, it is possible to argue the last two months have been the most testing of his managerial career as Everton have plummeted from being Champions League dark horses to the fringes of the relegation skirmish. Looking at the squad they have – a number of promising young internationals allied with experienced old campaigners – Everton should not be rubbing shoulders with those clubs fighting to stay above water but that is what happens when clubs endure a run of one win in 12 games. Mirallas was substituted at half-time by Everton manager Roberto Martinez and replaced by Bryan Oviedo . Lukaku tries to break the deadlock in the second half for Everton, but watches his shot fly wide of Foster's near post . Roberto Martinez watched his side struggle to a draw to extend their winless run to six games on Monday against Tony Pulis' men . Everton's troubles have clearly been weighing on Martinez's shoulders, as he has looked drawn and tired in recent weeks, in desperate need of a tonic. Or – more accurately – in desperate need of three points. That gives you an idea of what was riding on this encounter. And that puts Mirallas' miss into sharper perspective. He swept his right-footed wide of the post and even if it had been on target, Foster had dived the right way and would have got there. As the ball cannoned into the advertising hoardings, groans swept the stadium and Martinez looked bewildered. Baines' record is 15 successful kicks from 16 and missing at Old Trafford in October clearly had no lasting impact, as the following month he successfully converted against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. In a game where there was no margin for error, this was a huge mistake. West Brom striker Saido Berahino battles for the ball with Everton's Muhamed Besic during their clash at Goodison Park . A message on the big screen at Goodison Park explaining that a new Rocky movie was being filmed during half-time . A film crew on the pitch at Goodison Park at half-time to film a new Rocky movie starring actor Sylvester Stallone . A photograph of actor Stallone appears on a big screen inside the stadium as preparations are made to film part of the new Rocky movie . That proved to be Mirallas' last contribution, as he never resurfaced after the break, his place being taken by Bryan Oviedo; Martinez had been answering questions about Mirallas' future before this game, in relation to a new contract, but this hardly did the Belgian any good. 'At that moment he felt confident and he wanted to take it,' said Martinez, who revealed Mirallas' substitution was down to him suffering a hamstring problem. 'Leighton Baines is the No 1 penalty taker, but at that point I would have been happy to allow him and Kevin to discuss that. 'The issue is we have not scored the penalty and we have not scored. Kevin Mirallas scored the first penalty at West Ham in the penalty shootout. He was not 100 per cent, he was feeling his hamstring and straight after the penalty. We needed a dynamic player in the second half.' Trouble was, there was no dynamism. West Brom, for whom Claudio Yacob, Gareth McAuley and Ben Foster were superb, stood firm and deserved their point. They headed home with their spirits lifted. Martinez, by contrast, left with his anxieties increasing.","Everton held to goalless draw by West Brom at Goodison Park on Monday .

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger should sign either Sven or Lars Bender ahead of their international team-mate Ilkay Gundogan, according to former Premier League midfielder Dietmar Hamann. The Gunners have been linked with making a move for Borussia Dortmund's Gundogan in recent weeks but Hamann believes Arsenal already possess similar players to the deep-lying playmaker. Hamann insists Wenger should instead target a  defensive midfielder in the mould of 'Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel at Chelsea; or Fernando and Fernandinho at City' such as Dortmund's Sven or Bayer Leverkusen's Lars.

He’s a very good footballer – but he’s a typical Arsenal player. 'He won’t want to do the dirty work. His instinct is to join in further up the pitch, get a few forward passes going and try to weigh in with a few goals.

"Manuel Pellegrini has admitted Manchester City’s chances of retaining the Barclays Premier League hinge on them beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge after a crushing 2-0 defeat against Arsenal. City were beaten at the Etihad when Santi Cazorla converted a disputed 24th minute penalty and the outstanding Olivier Giroud finished off City with a 67th minute header. The defeat means Pellegrini’s stumbling side are five points behind Chelsea, who beat Swansea 5-0 on Saturday, ahead of their clash at Stamford Bridge on January 31. Manuel Pellegrini looks up to the heavens in despair during Manchester City's 2-0 defeat by Arsenal . Olivier Giroud (right) nods the ball past Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal to double Arsenal's advantage . Pellegrini, who was unable to explain City’s dreadful performance, said: ‘The game we must play at Stamford Bridge is a very important game. ‘We must close the gap to two points. I hope we are going to recover and play the way we are playing so far. With the ball we didn’t have clear ideas. ‘Chelsea will be a very decisive game. We will try to win that game to close that gap again. ‘We didn’t play a good game. We ran a lot and had a lot of possession but we didn’t have creative ideas to try and find the space against a team that defend very well.’ Arsenal were awarded a penalty in the 24th minute when Nacho Monreal appeared to go down easily after a collision with City captain Vincent Kompany. Cazorla converted to put Arsenal ahead. Pellegrini added: ‘I doubt it was a penalty but after the penalty we have enough time. I don’t remember just one save from Joe Hart. We didn’t create many chances to score. Giroud salutes the crowd after doubling the Gunners' lead during the second half against City . ‘There are two principal reasons we lost. One was the penalty, which changed the game. I don't think it was a penalty, but it was unnecessary for Kompany to do it. ‘We were not creative - we didn't have the ideas to cause damage in their defence. Without creativity it is difficult to score goals. ‘The movement of Kompany allows Monreal to dive. I am not saying it was a bad mistake of the referee. The penalty changed the game, but it was not the reason we lost. Of course, I always give credit to the team that wins the game. Arsenal played very concentrated. ‘We ran the whole game, pressed very well, but we didn't have the ideas of how to create the space in their defence.’ Arsenal were impressive throughout and this was an important victory after wins for Southampton, Manchester United and Tottenham on Saturday. Wenger’s side moved into fifth place in the Premier League and are just three points behind third placed Southampton with 16 games left of the season. The Arsenal manager even claimed his team should have won more comfortable after Giroud added their second. He said: ‘After we scored the first goal we controlled it and looked dangerous. We have good solidarity and the regret is that we did not always take advantage of the situations we created because we could have scored more. Santi Cazorla (far left) gave Arsenal the lead from the penalty spot against Manchester City . ‘It is good because we have injured players back and they have been out for a long time. It is an important period, but some of our players are in really good form. ‘What is for sure is that it increases the level and belief because we have five months in front of us. Games like that can help.’ Wenger also admitted that his team were fortunate to earn a penalty when Monreal went down. The Arsenal chief added: ‘My initial reaction was penalty. Someone told me it was a bit fortunate, but it goes for both teams. ‘The referee has to make a quick decision and I am in favour of some support for offsides and penalties.’","Manchester City lost 2-0 against Arsenal on Sunday .

"Chris Ashton was deemed surplus to requirements by England during the autumn but the Saracens winger has not given up on his international ambitions. He started just one Test in 2014 but put his hand up for a recall with a double in the 33-10 win over Munster on Saturday, taking him to 19 tries in 22 European games. Asked about his hopes of a Six Nations call-up, Ashton (right) said: ‘I don’t expect anything. 'I’ve got to fight to get back in. Hopefully Stuart (Lancaster) will recognise my hunger to play for England is as strong as ever. That’ll never change.’ Chris Ashton - seen celebrating a try for Saracens on Saturday - says he will fight for an England recall . London Irish hooker David Paice will face a disciplinary panel after his red card in the 43-41 win over Grenoble in the Challenge Cup. Paice was adjudged to have entered a ruck with his head, but the Exiles held on for their first victory since Brian Smith left. Tom Coventry, Smith’s summer replacement, wants Clark Laidlaw, cousin of Greig, to join his coaching team. London Irish hooker David Paice (middle) looks bemused at the decision to send him off against Grenoble . The great escape is still on for James Haskell’s Wasps after the England hopeful delivered a tackling masterclass in the 23-3 victory at Harlequins on Saturday night. Despite losing their first two Pool 2 games, Wasps could secure a home quarter-final if they beat Leinster at home this Saturday. Wasps are hoping to rekindle their glory days of the last decade and Haskell, who made 28 of his side’s 199 tackles at The Stoop, wants to emulate the achievements of his predecessor, Joe Worsley, whose career was cut short by a neck injury. James Haskell produced a tackling masterclass for Wasps against Harlequins on Saturday . ‘One of my heroes in rugby is Joe Worsley,’ said Haskell. ‘He would regularly put in 30 tackles a game. He taught me to tackle, so if I can get to that level I am pleased. ‘When I re-signed and came back from New Zealand (in 2012) we nearly got relegated. My knees were gone, I think Dai (Young) thought he had signed a donkey. There was lots of change. If we can keep the squad together and keep signing players, then I think we have more to give.’ A deal for All Blacks winger Frank Halai is close to completion, while Sportsmail understands that Scotland international Tim Visser is also on the club’s radar.","Chris Ashton has scored 19 tries in 22 European games .

"A distinct lack of organization, a huge fanfare surrounding a few big names, followed by a bizarre but somehow enthralling spectacle. If the Africa Cup of Nations follows the same pattern as the opening ceremony, the next three weeks will be a lot of fun. During the pre-match festivities the Equato-Guinean fans in the Estadio de Bata seemed as excited for American RnB star Akon as they were for their collection of players, assembled primarily from the smaller leagues around Europe. But that all changed after 16 minutes, when the game, and the tournament, came to life. Middlesbrough striker Emilio Nsue put the hosts ahead following brilliant work from young winger Kike, a reserve at Real Mallorca down the right, and Bata erupted. In the end it was not quite enough for the win, but it was a fine way to announce the tournament’s arrival.

But, roared on by what felt like the whole city, they showed that they intend to continue this competition’s record of hosts making it past the group stage, which has stood since 1994. And they could have won this, Balboa and Nsue both spurning good chances to extend the lead when the score was 1-0. Both strikers, however, fired tamely at Christoffer Mafoumbi in the Congo goal, while Nsue saw another strike harshly ruled out for offside. Three minutes from time they were punished, former West Brom forward Thievy Bifouma slotting home. Up until the equalizer, Congo had offered little. Ladislas Douniama missed the clearest opportunities they created, forcing a good save from Felipe Ovono just moments after coming on before heading against the post from close range with 10 minutes left. It will not be enough to worry either Gabon or Burkina Faso, this group’s other sides. Congo manager Claude Le Roy was adamant that his side had been undone by the conditions. Speaking after the match Le Roy, in his eighth Cup of Nations as a manager, was furious that the side's journey to the ground, usually around 12 minutes, took over an hour, in a bus with no air conditioning.

"Sacking Harry Redknapp on the back of Saturday’s defeat against Manchester United would be harsh. If QPR chairman Tony Fernandes was looking at their performance against Manchester United for reasons to pull the trigger then he needed to look pretty hard. This wasn’t the performance of a side who aren’t in tune with their manager, just one lacking attacking invention. QPR manager Harry Redknapp has been under the spotlight after his side's latest Premier League defeat . Redknapp (far left) has been backed to keep his job at Loftus Road despite losing against Manchester United . Redknapp is in regular contact with QPR chairman Tony Fernandes, who has supported his manager . On the evidence of Saturday’s display, QPR players are very much with their underfire manager. Nevertheless, there are still figures within the Loftus Road hierarchy who believe Redknapp’s time should be up. CLICK HERE to read the match report as Louis van Gaal's team won 2-0 . For them, their woeful away form is simply not good enough. For them, his constant reference to the club being able to sign only loan players this month is an excuse to hide the deficiencies of the previous transfer window. For them, QPR will be relegated if the club decide against making a change and see now as the perfect time. Following their exit from the FA Cup, Rangers now have just under two weeks until their next Premier League clash against Stoke. From the outside looking in it seems there is no time like the present to make a managerial change early this week. Fernandes, so far, has backed his manager and resisted any urge to make a change, despite people telling him otherwise. The formation of Redknapp’s substitutes bench on Saturday wouldn’t have helped the manager’s cause, though. Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker were both there, having arrived in the summer. Fellow summer signing Jordon Mutch didn’t even make the matchday squad, while Sandro, who had a history of knee problems during his time at Spurs, remains unavailable — with a knee injury. James Wilson (left) came on as a second half substitute to wrap up the match for the visitors with this goal . Wilson (left) celebrates scoring Manchester United's second goal of the game in their 2-0 win at QPR . Goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, signed from Reading, is still second choice to veteran keeper Rob Green and loan signing Mauro Zarate is yet to feature, having joined from West Ham earlier this month. So, with that in mind, Redknapp’s hurry to point out that the club can only afford to sign loan players this month has not gone down too well among members of the Loftus Road hierarchy. Having spoken to Fernandes on the phone last week, Redknapp has been assured his job isn’t under threat. However, should Fernandes start listening to some of the dissenting voices, that could yet change.","Despite loss against Manchester United QPR looked in tune with their boss .

The 19-year-old Chile Under 20 left winger would have done just that by scoring an outstanding free-kick while representing his country.

"When Manchester City host Arsenal at the Etihad on Sunday, not only will two of the best teams in the Premier League be going head to head, but two of the league's brightest stars. Alexis Sanchez and Sergio Aguero have been the focal points for their sides, plundering 26 league goals between them. The two would be almost certain to make up any composite Premier League XI, but if you could only have one, who would you choose? Sportsmail's reporters reveal which of the South American duo they would pick? Sergio Aguero does some fitness work as Manchester City team-mate Martin Demichelis (right) watches on . Alexis Sanchez trains with Mesut Ozil (centre) and Joel Campbell (right) last Saturday . Martin Keown - Aguero . It’s a close call because they are both top-quality players who have the ability to absolutely embarrass defenders with their pace and skill. But I think I’d take Aguero over Sanchez. He is in the top three strikers we have ever seen in the Premier League and has been performing at incredible levels of consistency since he first arrived. It’s still early days for Sanchez, but he has certainly made a stunning start to his career at Arsenal. Neil Ashton - Aguero . His hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League at the Etihad was something special. He also kept his cool with the last chance of the game against QPR to win the title for Manchester City. Sanchez has been brilliant for Arsenal but Aguero is ruthless in front of goal. Rob Draper - Sanchez . This is almost impossible! In terms of ability, goal-scoring, finishing and technique it’s hard to split them. But if you insist I’ll go for Sanchez because he’s injured less and because of the energy he gives to them team. Like Luis Suarez, he galvanises the entire team with his pressing. It’s not that Aguero doesn’t do his fair share but Sanchez is exceptional. And when you see your star player working that hard, it means every other player has to follow the example. Chris Wheeler - Sanchez . On current form, it would have to be Sanchez – not least because he can stay fit. Aguero is the better finisher but he missed a large portion of last season with muscle injuries and only returned to action for Manchester City last weekend after another seven-game absence. Sanchez has set the Premier League alight for Arsenal and also offers more in terms of where he can play across the front and work-rate. Sanchez has scored 12 Premier League goals for Arsenal this season since signing from Barcelona . Aguero scores against Sunderland, one of 14 Premier League goals for the City star this season . Aguero (centre) warms up with his City team-mates on Wednesday as they gear up to face Arsenal . ALEXIS SANCHEZ . AGE: 26 . HEIGHT: 5ft 7in . WEIGHT: 70kg .

Very close call but the City striker edges it for me due to his frightening ability to score whatever the circumstances. No matter how tight an angle or implausible a path to goal, he finds a way. Electric speed and mercurial movement over a sustained period. Although a fearsome forward, Sanchez has found himself shut out on a few occasions when Aguero would have netted. Phil Duncan - Sanchez . Aguero’s goal record is unrivalled. If he carries on like this, he’ll be remembered as one of the all-time Premier League greats. But if I had to choose between City’s sharp-shooter and  Sanchez, I’d pick the Arsenal man all day and every day. Sanchez scores but he offers so much more than that. He makes goals, too, his workload is astonishing and he isn’t afraid to get hurt. No wonder he’s quickly emerged as a favourite on the terraces and the first name on Arsene Wenger’s teamsheet. Sam Cunningham - Aguero . When Aguero is fit and firing he is virtually unstoppable. At the start of the season before his injury in December, the Manchester City striker was beginning to be talked about in the same breath as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Aguero can't quite find the consistency of fitness to propel him into the upper echelons. While Sanchez is a phenomenal player, he is distinctly a level below Aguero at 100 per cent. Sami Mokbel - Sanchez . It's close, because they are two brilliant footballers. But the Arsenal star is more of an all-rounder. Aguero's game is about scoring goals - Sanchez does that and more. So Sanchez - but only just. Matt Lawless - Aguero . I love Sanchez's never-say-die attitude. His work-rate is phenomenal and he has been the glue to hold Arsenal together this season. He is pure class. But I'd still have Aguero over him in my team. His movement is second to none, his feet are lightning fast and his finishing speaks for itself. Quality personified. Can't I just say both though? No, OK... Aguero it is then. Just. Aguero comes on for Stevan Jovetic during City's 1-1 draw with Everton - his comeback game from injury . Sanchez loses his footing but manages to get a shot off against Stoke at the Emirates last week . Mike Keegan - Aguero . City's talisman has the best strike-rate in Premier League history among anyone who has played 100 games. He is not just the best attacker in England, he is one of the best in the world and already has two titles under his belt. Would Barcelona have sold him? I don't think so. Mike Anstead - Aguero . Sanchez has been a revelation since arriving at Arsenal but Aguero edges it for me for his ability to find a goal from nowhere. When he's fit and on it, there's no better striker in the Premier League. Craig Hope - Sanchez . Aguero is the better player, yes, but Sanchez does it every week - he's never injured and has contributed to more than half of Arsenal's goals by scoring or setting them up. With Aguero, you never know when he's next set for a spell on the sidelines. TOTAL: AGUERO 7 SANCHEZ 5 .","Sportsmail's experts reveal which of the South American stars they prefer .

"Serena Williams attended an event for lingerie and sports bra brand Berlei on Thursday, the day after the world No 1 was announced as the top seed for the Australian Open. Williams, who is the face of Berlei, took centre-stage in a TV advertising campaign for the brand that aired for the first time on Monday, a week before the tournament kicks off. And Williams - who was pictured showing off one of the bras - joined models at the event in Melbourne, where the sportswear range was put to the test with a series of exercises. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Serena Williams stars in Berlei bra advert . Serena WIlliams shows off a colourful Berlei bra at an event in Melbourne on Thursday .

Williams watches on as models test out the underwear while playing basketball . Williams, who has been seeded first for the Australian Open, chats on stage with one of the models . Speaking earlier this week about her involvement with Berlei Williams said: 'My mom first discovered Berlei while on a trip to Australia almost 10 years ago and I have been wearing their bras ever since – for every tennis match without fail. 'So when the brand approached me to work with them on their latest campaign for 2015, I jumped at the chance. 'I had such a great time shooting my very first TV commercial for the brand, it's such an exciting campaign that I'm very proud to be part of.' The models test out the Berlei sportswear range as they perform exercises on the stage . The 33-year-old is bidding to win her sixth Australian Open title when the tournament begins on Monday . Williams, who said she wears a Berlei bra every time she steps on to the court, was all smiles at the event . Meanwhile, two-time champion Victoria Azarenka faces the prospect of drawing a top player in the first round at the Australian Open after missing out on a seeding Wednesday. Last year was one to forget for Azarenka - injuries to her left foot, then right knee and right foot restricted her to just 24 matches last year and her WTA ranking has dropped to 41. The top 32 players are seeded, and tournament officials went strictly by the rankings released Monday to determine the seedings list this year on both the men's and women's side. Williams and No 2 Maria Sharapova will be on opposite sides of the draw after their world rankings were reflected in the seedings for the first major of the year. World No 2 Maria Sharapova kas been kept on the opposite side of the draw after being seeded second . Two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka is unseeded for this year's tournament . Former No 1 Azarenka, who won the Australian Open in 2012 and 2013 and reached two Grand Slam quarter-finals in 2014 during an injury-interrupted year, dropped from a No 32 year-end ranking. Azarenka's first-round loss last week at the Brisbane International to Karolina Pliskova, after wasting two match points in the second set, cost her any chance of climbing back into the top 32. China's Li Na has retired and won't be defending her Australian title. Dominika Cibulkova, the losing finalist last year at Melbourne Park, is seeded No 11. Eugenie Bouchard, the 20-year-old Canadian who last year reached the semi-finals at the Australian and French Opens before making the Wimbledon final, is seeded No 7. Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, pictured practicing on Monday, is seeded seventh . Rafael Nadal was put through a rigorous workout on Thursday ahead of the tournament . On the men's side, Nos 1-3 Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are all seeded ahead of defending men's champion Stan Wawrinka, who is No 4. US Open finalist Kei Nishikori of Japan was seeded fifth, one spot ahead of three-time Australian Open finalist Andy Murray. On Wednesday, Nadal had a strong training session at Melbourne Park, indicating he might be overcoming some recent health and injury issues. Nadal was sidelined for three months with a right wrist injury after Wimbledon. He briefly returned at Beijing in late September where he advanced to the quarterfinals. He then had appendix surgery in early November which he is still recovering from. 'This is the third comeback of my career after injury, so we will see how it goes,' Nadal said.","Serena Williams has been seeded first for the Australian Open .

"Paul Pogba will not be leaving Juventus in the January transfer window despite the French midfielder being linked with several of Europe's elite clubs, according to agent Mino Raiola. The 21-year-old is reportedly wanted by the likes of Chelsea, Real Madrid and former club Manchester United but looks set to remain in Turin until at least the end of the season having only recently signed a five-year deal with the Serie A champions. Speaking top Sky Sports, Raiola said: 'He will stay here this window in Italy and after that it's also up to Juventus and up to himself to see what are the possibilities and what are the things to do.

"Patrick Bamford has been on the Etihad Stadium pitch just once before. He was in the crowd for a Bon Jovi concert. On Saturday, the Chelsea loanee is out to make himself the headline act when Championship side Middlesbrough take on Manchester City in the fourth round of the FA Cup. One day, though, he hopes to take centre stage, guitar in hand. For the 21-year-old boasts many talents away from football. Not too many professionals can say that an offer from Harvard University was the back-up plan to a career in the game. And neither are many English players conversational in German and French, with Spanish on the ‘to do list’. Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford hopes to be a big hit when Middlesbrough take on Manchester City . Indeed, Grantham-born Bamford — once a promising rugby union full back — was a straight-A student and took his GCSE and A-Level exams a year early at the prestigious Nottingham High School. But it is music in which he has always excelled. He can play the piano, violin and saxophone and is on the lookout for a Teesside-based guitar tutor. In the meantime, he is teaching himself. ‘Every day after training I play for about an hour, or until my fingers get sore,’ the England Under-21 striker tells Sportsmail as, perhaps unknowingly, he taps his fingers on the desk. ‘I don’t want to p*** off the neighbours too much because the sound-proofing in my flat is awful. ‘But I love it. I just typed “easy songs to learn” into YouTube one day and this American guy — Martyzsongs — popped up. He doesn’t know it, but I spend an hour with him every day.’ In Bamford’s playbook are Oasis, Rod Stewart, Van Morrison and the aforementioned Bon Jovi. Bamford's only previous visit to the Etihad stadium in Manchester was for a Bon Jovi concert . CLARKE CARLISLE . Dubbed ‘Britain’s Brainiest Footballer’ after winning an ITV quiz, Carlisle also appeared on Countdown and Question Time. FRANK LAMPARD . Scored above 150 in an IQ test and left school with 12 GCSEs, including an A in Latin. JUAN MATA . Studied for journalism degree as well as reading marketing and sports science. SEYI OLOFINJANA . Once of Stoke and Hull City, Nigerian Olofinjana obtained a masters in chemical engineering in his homeland. ANDREY ARSHAVIN . After studying Technology and Design at university, the Russian penned a thesis on a suit that can be used as sportswear. The former Nottingham Forest trainee — who joined the Blues for £1.5million three years ago — said: ‘When I first signed for Chelsea I went to a charity dinner where I was drawing the raffle. One of the prizes in the auction was Bon Jovi tickets. There didn’t seem to be much interest so I put in a bid of £60 and won — it was brilliant.’ Recognising a bargain ties in with Bamford’s economics A-Level and the offer from Harvard, the American Ivy League university which invited him to study business (and play football) aged 17. He is also shrewd enough to know that the odds are stacked against Boro this afternoon. ‘I think we’ve got a chance, I really do, as long as we stick to our game plan,’ says Bamford, who turned down Harvard in favour of his scholarship at Forest. ‘I saw City against (Sheffield) Wednesday in the last round and they were pushed all the way and I watched Arsenal beat them last weekend. ‘I see it as a one-off chance to prove yourself against top opposition, to express yourself and get your name out there.’ Bamford scored last-gasp equaliser at Liverpool in League Cup tie earlier this season . It is at Stamford Bridge, however, where he ultimately hopes to strike the right chord. Jose Mourinho’s former Real Madrid assistant, Aitor Karanka, is in charge at Boro and the Chelsea boss insisted in the summer that Bamford move to the North East. Mourinho makes regular checks on his progress and has taken a shine to the erudite and engaging youngster. ‘The first time I met him was with the technical director and my dad,’ Bamford recalls. ‘He walked in and said, “What do you want?” I told him, “To play for Chelsea”. 'I think he liked that. When I left he was very emotional and gave me a hug goodbye and told me to do my best. It meant a lot.’ There is, of course, a danger that Bamford will never get to play under Mourinho. Romelu Lukaku scored 32 Premier League goals over two seasons on loan at West Brom and Everton yet was still offloaded. Bamford has 34 goals during loan stays at League One MK Dons, Derby County and Boro. Bamford hopes his loan spell at Middlesbrough will help him make the grade at Chelsea . But there is something entirely convincing when he tells you he will play for the Blues. ‘I believe so, yes,’ he returns when the question is put to him. ‘Whether it’s next year, or the year after, I believe I will be there. ‘Of course, I will be doing well to displace Diego Costa! But I’d like to think I could maybe go back next season as the third-choice striker and then challenge for the position of second striker. I’ve got full belief in myself.’ There is something reassuringly ruthless about Bamford. He is also smart enough to detach himself from terrace emotion. After all, how many Forest season-ticket holders would sign for Derby? And then, having scored eight times for the Rams and starred in a 5-0 thrashing of his boyhood team, return to the City Ground as a fan? The message, then, is clear: when Bamford sets his sights on something – playing for Chelsea, learning the guitar or teaching himself Spanish – nothing will get in his way. ‘I love it here, but at the end of the day it’s a job,’ he says. ‘Sometimes that’s hard with fans – especially last year at Derby with it being a big thing joining them as a Forest fan – then you leave them. Romelu Lukaku scored 32 Premier League goals on loan at West Brom and Everton yet was still offloaded . ‘I watched Forest quite a bit at the start of the season and the Derby fans hated it, they didn’t seem to appreciate that when I was there it was a job and I did my best professionally.’ For now, he is fully signed up to Middlesbrough’s top-flight bid. Last weekend, when Forest beat Boro’s promotion-rivals Derby thanks to Ben Osborn’s late winner in the lunchtime kick-off, Bamford hit the roof. ‘You should have seen my celebration in the changing-room,’ he laughs. ‘I was jumping in the air when Ben scored. I was with him all the way through from 10-year-old at Forest to when I left for Chelsea. ‘I went on the pitch with a smile that day.My friend scored, Forest got a win which they needed, our rivals got beat and we went on to win as well – it was a good day.’ There is still hope, however, that this season will not be his last at the Riverside. At the end of the day, what Jose says, his players do. ‘It’s possible that I could be back next season,’ he admits. ‘If we do get promoted and I have a sit-down with Jose and discuss what is best, then perhaps it might be to come back here for game-time. ‘That could well happen because I honestly think we will win promotion. We have a brilliant togetherness and I don’t think there is a squad as good as us in the Championship.’ On Saturday, though, it is all about the FA Cup.","Patrick Bamford set to lead Middlesbrough attack against Manchester City .

"Both Cape Verde and Zambia were eliminated from the Africa Cup of Nations on Monday after they played out a goalless draw in treacherous conditions at Estadio de Ebibeyin. Cape Verde finished with three points and with the same goal difference as the Democratic Republic of Congo, who drew 1-1 with Tunisia in Bata at the same time, but scored one goal less and were therefore eliminated by the slimmest of margins.

DR Congo go through with group winners Tunisia. Zambia, who were the 2012 winners, finished last in Group B with only two points. The match was played in a tropical downpour that made the game unplayable at times as giant puddles stopped the flow of the ball and risked injury to the players. The teams were forced to keep the ball off the ground for much of the second half as the deluge fell increasingly harder but then suddenly abated with some 20 minutes left. Both sides had few occasions to win the game, not even towards the end when they both sacrificed defenders to throw more players into attack. Garry Rodrigues, making his first start at the tournament for Cape Verde, went narrowly wide with two efforts in the first half while Zambia's Evans Kangwa botched a shot from close in 12 minutes from the end. There was also a half chance in stoppage time for Mukuka Mulenga of Zambia but he, too, was off target. 'I'm very sad and disappointed with the result but not with my players. They did all they could,' a tearful Cape Verde coach Rui Aguas told reporters. 'We missed a lot of chances in three games but we gave 100 percent, we gave our all.'

"Much will be written about the trip to Abu Dhabi in the middle of a season and the logic of landing back in the country 21 hours before a match. But was City's mid-season jaunt behind their staggering loss to Middlesbrough? It would certainly appear so. Manuel Pellegrini watches on as his Manchester City side were beaten 2-0 by Middlesbrough on Saturday . But the City boss refused to blame their week-long trip to Abu Dhabi for the FA Cup defeat . City players James Milner (left), Dedryck Boyata (centre) and Fernando look dejected after their side concede . In the first half there was little evidence of what was to follow. The hosts were probed and pressed throughout and if it was not for the heroics of Boro keeper Tomas Mejias they would have been out of sight. However, after the break it was a different story. The buoyant visitors seemed to hit a visibly tiring home side at will on the break. Had it not been for some fine stops from Willy Caballero and a post denying the effervescent Lee Tomlin a goal of the season contender, they would have made the scoreline look even worse than 2-0. At one stage a frustrated Aleksandar Kolarov seemed to just stop what he was doing. It looked as though their minds were still in Abu Dhabi. Patrick Bamford raced through to put Middlesbrough ahead early in the second half . The on-loan Chelsea striker celebrates after scoring Boro's opening goal against Manchester City . Middlesbrough substitute Kike celebrates after scoring in stoppage time to seal his side's FA Cup passage . When the board came up to tell us four minutes were to be added on we expected one final onslaught, but it simply did not come. If anything, it was the visitors who finished the stronger of the two and the game was up long before Kike sealed the deal. City may point to a lack of match fitness to key players such as Vincent Kompany and Sergio Aguero. Dedryck Boyata looked nervy as did Caballero. The City squad are put through their paces during their warm-weather training camp trip to Abu Dhabi . Manager Pellegrini and his players arrived back in Manchester at about 8pm on Friday night .

But this was a team that should not be beaten by Middlesbrough, as superb as Aitor Karaoke's men were. Can a seven-hour flight in business class and a four-hour time difference have such an impact? City will deny it but this, as we are told time and time again, is a game of fine margins. Defeat, and the trip to Abu Dhabi will linger.

"In fairness to Manuel Pellegrini, there was only so much he could say. Here he was, after all, in the bowels of the Etihad Stadium, reflecting on the potentially negative impact of a flight on an Etihad jet owned by his club’s main sponsor. But Manchester City’s manager was struggling to defend the position he had initially adopted when asked if a tired display against Middlesbrough was the product of a seven-hour journey the previous evening. In his post-match press conference he had politely but firmly rejected such accusations. In a side room later, however, he argued with less conviction, even admitting that his own view of the situation might have been flawed. ‘I am not saying what I am saying is the correct thing,’ he said. ‘I give an opinion.’ Manuel Pellegrini looks disheartened during Manchester City's defeat at the Etihad Stadium . Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford celebrates after scoring for his side against Manchester City . Middlesbrough's Kike celebrates after scoring in stoppage time to seal his side's passage to the next round . Perhaps more telling was when Pellegrini was asked if such a visit to the Abu Dhabi home of his super-rich employers would have been arranged had they been playing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the game which comes next for a City side now reflecting on back-to-back defeats after their loss to Arsenal. ‘It was not a game with Chelsea,’ he replied. ‘I don’t want to say because you are telling me something that is not relative.’ So he was asked again. Would they have spent 14 hours on a plane, not to mention five days in a different time zone, had it been the week they were meeting their main rivals for the Premier League title? ‘Chelsea stayed here. They did not go to Abu Dhabi,’ he said. ‘Tottenham stayed here. They did not go to Abu Dhabi. I respect your opinion but you respect also mine.’ With the greatest respect his point was not a terribly valid one when Cup defeats for Chelsea and Tottenham do not hide the fact that landing back so late from Abu Dhabi — around 8pm — amounted to far from ideal preparation. Manager Manuel Pellegrini and his players arrived back in Manchester at about 8pm on Friday night . David Silva and Vincent Kompany headed straight to the club's training base to prepare for Saturday's game . As Pellegrini acknowledged, it was not a game against Chelsea. No, it was an FA Cup game against Championship opposition and the City hierarchy obviously thought it the perfect week to put in an appearance for their sponsors. It somewhat undermined Pellegrini’s claim in his own programme notes that City were taking this competition every bit as seriously as the Premier League and Champions League. That, having been eliminated by Championship opposition in Wigan the previous season, they were going to give this a real shot. ‘We want to be at Wembley later in the season and we don’t prioritise the trophies we are involved in,’ he wrote. Only they do, even if we probably have to be fair to Pellegrini and recognise how unlikely it is that the trip would have been his idea. In this modern era of the game managers often have to bow to the demands of the money men. Presumably, they will do nothing to disrupt what now follows this weekend; that encounter with the current league leaders. The only flight City should consider boarding this week should be one to London. Manchester City players James Milner ), Dedryck Boyata and Fernando look dejected after their side concede .

"Manchester City remain hopeful James Milner will sign a new contract with the club - but fears are growing that the England man may soon be on the move. Following the 1-1 draw at Everton on January 10, manager Manuel Pellegrini said that he expected the versatile 29-year-old to pen a new deal 'within days'. But that has not yet happened and while negotiations are ongoing Milner, whose contract expires at the end of the season, is not thought to have a shortage of alternatives.

"Newcastle United will make Steve McClaren their No 1 target after confirming that John Carver will remain in charge until the end of the season. Derby County boss McClaren has connections with the Newcastle hierarchy and is close to chief scout Graham Carr who, along with managing director Lee Charnley, has been tasked with finding the new head coach. But their search to find Alan Pardew’s successor has been put off until the summer after McClaren declared his intention to remain with promotion-chasing Derby. Newcastle want Derby County boss Steve McClaren to become their new manager in the summer . McClaren (left) is Newcastle's No 1 target and is currently in a Premier League promotion push with Derby . John Carver, searching for his first win, will remain in charge of Newcastle for the remainder of the season . The 50-year-old will take control of Newcastle's last 16  matches and could land job on full-time basis . Carver was on Newcastle's books as a youngster in the early 1980s but never made the breakthrough . As a consequence, Carver was on Monday told to carry on in his caretaker capacity for the remainder of the season. The 50-year-old could yet win the position on a permanent basis if he impresses between now and May 24 and McClaren decides against quitting Derby. However, Carver is still searching for his first win and takes his side to Hull on Saturday lunchtime. Newcastle are 11th but he has been challenged by Toon chief Charnley to return a top-10 finish. ‘Our goal for the season of a minimum top-10 finish remains unchanged and we are confident that John, supported by the backroom staff, will be able to deliver this,’ Charnley said. ‘At the beginning of this process it was my desire and intention to appoint an individual to the position of head coach who would be available to start immediately. Having now explored at some length the options available to us, the decision has been taken to defer the appointment of a permanent head coach until the end of the season. ‘The head coach will be a long-term appointment that will play a major role in shaping the future on-field progression of Newcastle United and it is vitally important that we get the right individual.’ Alan Pardew (right) left Newcastle earlier in January and has made an immediate impact at Crystal Palace . Carver, who was a trainee player at the club, returned as a youth coach in 1992 and has served as assistant to Ruud Gullit, Sir Bobby Robson and Pardew. The Newcastle-born coach said: ‘This is a proud day for me. I have worked with, and learnt from the best manager that this football club has had in Sir Bobby Robson. I know what this club means to this city and its people. I believe in my players and the staff I have around me. ‘I am confident that we can deliver exciting, successful football and look forward with relish to my role as head coach of this great football club.’ Meanwhile, Newcastle have won the race to sign MK Dons teenage midfielder Dele Alli.

The British/Australian combination of Murray and Peers have shown promising signs at the start of this year after winning the Brisbane International two weeks ago. Although the 2015 season is admittedly still young, Murray and Peers currently sit fourth in the ATP Doubles Team rankings, with the top eight qualifying for the season-ending finals at the O2 Arena in London. The first Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne offers a good opportunity to notch up plenty of ranking points towards London, the pair already earning 180 for their run here. Murray and Peers, the No 16 seeds, dominated from the off and two breaks saw them claim the opening set, during which they made just one unforced error. Although Jasika and Smith stepped up their game in the second set, the regular pairing of Murray and Peers were too strong and wrapped up the match with the minimum of fuss. After having a whole host of different partners through the years, Murray is now reaping the benefits of having a long-term steady partnership with Peers. Murray, 28, said: 'This is our third year now, I think it’s probably quite a long-term partnership currently on the tour.

"Paul John Stamp was allegedly burned to death by Gary Stewart Miles and Gregory John Channing after a row over beer last year . A man is accused of burning his friend to death after the friend drank his last four cans of beer. Gary Stewart Miles, 40, is accused of murdering Paul John Stamp, 47, in Darwin in September last year after a row. According to news.com.au, Stamp, who was sharing a house with Miles at the time, apparently drank the last four cans of Miles' beer, despite being warned not to. When Miles found out, he and Gregory Channing allegedly beat Stamp, breaking eight ribs and causing internal injuries. The duo are then accused of dragging him to the boot of a car before driving to an industrial estate where they planned to 'teach him a lesson' by making him walk home. Darwin Supreme Court heard that the car ran out of fuel, so the pair hitched a ride to get some more, and when they returned Miles poured the petrol over the car before setting it alight and burning Stamp to death. Miles denies murder. Channing is already serving a five year sentence for assault on Stamp and deprivation of liberty. Appearing in court, Channing told prosecutors that Miles had snapped, shouting 'I'm going to kill this c***' while covering the car with fuel. Miles was shocked by what he'd done, Channing said, adding: 'You could tell by the way he was, he was a different person. Upset, like he couldn't believe what happened, like it didn't happen but it did.' But defence counsel Jon Tippett QC accused Channing of setting the car alight because he hadn't liked Stamp, who had been disrespectful and commented on Channing's girlfriend's breasts. 'You were the person who came up with the plan, weren't you, because this man Stamp really p***** you off,' Mr Tippett alleged. Channing agreed but denied starting the fire. He previously told the court that Miles initiated the beating and paid for the fuel but under cross-examination said he had paid for it, as Miles didn't have his wallet. The pair were arrested last year, two days after Stamp's body was found in the burned out car. The pair, who deny the murder, have appeared in Darwin Supreme Court. Channing is already serving five years after being found guilty of assault and depriving Mr Stamp of his liberty in December . Speaking to the Australian Times, Stamp's brother Craig, said he had moved from Western Australia to the Northern Territory a week before while looking for a job in mining. He said: 'It’s just insane. He just had a big heart and loved everyone. He always tried hard to please everyone. I spoke to him on Saturday, a mate had organised a job for him and found him an apartment. 'It was a new opportunity for him. The last I heard from him was when he sent me a text on Tuesday for my son’s birthday, and then it happened that night.'

"Plans: Mark David Chapman said a minister in upstate New York offered him a place to live and work if he had been granted parole . A minister in a small town in upstate New York had offered to put up John Lennon’s killer if Mark David Chapman got parole, but Chapman said he may not have gone. According to the hearing transcript released today, Chapman, 57, a former security guard from Hawaii, said during an August 22 parole hearing that he's been offered lodging and a farm job by Stanley Thurber in Medina, a village between Rochester and Buffalo. He also said that if he was granted parole, he would ‘probably stay right where I’m at’ – in prison. The convicted killer added: ‘I’m so bonded that I could probably assure you that, if released, I’d probably stay right where I’m at. ‘You know, once you stand on a rock for 20 years and feel the waves on you and you don’t go anywhere because you’re on a rock, you don’t want to move.’ Chapman, who was again denied parole last week, shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the former Beatle lived. He was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. Speaking about Mr Thuber in the hearing, Chapman told the parole board: 'He's a minister and he's an older fellow and he has a lot of contacts in the area and he has agreed to refurbish his upstairs apartment for me and offered me two jobs.’ Fated meeting: John Lennon signs Mark Chapman's copy of Double Fantasy outside the Dakota Building in 1980, hours before Chapman opened fire on the former Beatle and killed him . Scene of the crime: Lennon lived at the Dakota Apartments on Manhattan's Upper West Side; there is now a plaque commemorating where the musician was shot . He said his wife, Gloria Hiroko . Chapman, met Thurber at a church function and was 'impressed by his deep . commitment to Christ.' After corresponding with Mr Thurber, Chapman . said, they met for the first time on August 20. A message left today by MailOnline at a phone number listed for Mr Thurber was not immediately returned. Young: Chapman was 25 when he murdered Lennon, and is seen in a December 9, 1980 booking photo . During . the hearing, Chapman again expressed remorse for the killing, spoke of . his Christian faith and talked about his routine at the Wende . Correctional Facility near Buffalo, where he was moved in May and placed . in 'involuntary protective custody.' 'I've been in my cell, basically, writing letters, reading, thinking,' Chapman said. He was locked up previously at Attica, where he worked in the prison law library. He said he didn't know why he'd been moved. During the August 22  hearing, Chapman remembered Lennon as a 'very cordial and very decent man' who stopped to sign an autograph hours before the murder. 'He was very kind to me,' Chapman said. 'Ironically, very kind and was very patient with me. The limousine was waiting, his wife was waiting in the limousine, and he took his time with me and he got the pen going and he signed my album. He asked me if I needed anything else. I said, no. No, sir and he walked way.' Chapman, who said his motivation for killing Lennon was instant notoriety, also told the parole board he was surprised more celebrities haven't been the targets of violence and said he has thought about someone trying to kill him as a way to gain fame as the person who avenged Lennon. 'To do something like that against another person, it's something that would keep me alive and boost me,' he said. 'That's ludicrous and I'm actually glad that that's not done more. I thought maybe more people would do that and I'm glad that they have not. 'I'm surprised that they have not because this society is just geared toward celebrity like crazy.' Concealed: A day after the 1980 murder, Mark David Chapman, centre, is escorted out of police station with a jacket covering his face and head . Weapon of choice: The .38 calibre handgun used by Mark David Chapman to kill John Lennon, seen on the 25th anniversary of Lennon's death, and stored by the NYPD . Chapman, who has said he considered killing several other celebrities, told the parole board he wanted Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, to know that he felt no anger toward Lennon. 'It wasn't anything against her husband as a person, only as a famous person,' he said. 'If he was less famous than three or four other people on the list, he would not have been shot. And that's the truth.' During an interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, Ono and the couple's son were reluctant to talk about Chapman or his latest parole denial. Reaction: Lennon's distraught fans gathered outside his apartment building on December 8, after he was gunned down . 'It's not the kind of thing you can really answer simply. I mean, it's complicated,' Sean Lennon said.  'But let's just say that our lives were changed forever by that, so it's a sensitive sort of thing.' 'Especially for Sean,' Ono added. 'Because Sean was so close to John and suddenly John was gone.' The parole board noted Chapman's . positive efforts while in prison but said releasing him would . 'trivialize the tragic loss of life which you caused with this heinous, . unprovoked, violent, cold and calculated crime.' At his previous hearing, he recalled that he had considered shooting Johnny Carson or Elizabeth Taylor instead, and said again that he chose Lennon because the ex-Beatle was more accessible. He said that his century-old Upper West Side apartment building by Central Park 'wasn't quite as cloistered.' Scottish holiday: John Lennon and Yoko Ono, with their children Julian Lennon and Kyoko Cox, on holiday at Durness, in Sutherland, Scotland . Widow's grief: Yoko Ono, centre, pictured in 2005 visiting Strawberry Fields, has requested that Chapman not be granted parole in an email to the New York Department of Corrections .

'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies,' Chapman told the board two years ago. Ono, 79, had said two years ago that she was trying to be 'practical' in asking that her husband's killer remain behind bars. She said Chapman might be a danger to her, other family members and perhaps even himself. In . a 1992 interview at Attica, Chapman told Barbara Walters that it was . dark when he shot Lennon in the back with a .38-caliber revolver after . he exited a limousine, headed up the walkway to his apartment building . and looked at Chapman. 'I . heard this voice - not an audible voice, an inaudible voice - saying . over and over, `Do it, do it, do it,'' Chapman said.

"The Australian Tax Office is threatening to take audit action against local companies and major multinational corporations following the leak of almost 28,000 pages of documents exposing their complex Luxembourg tax structures. An investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) found that accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers helped 343 local and overseas companies shrink their tax bills - in some cases to almost zero – by routing their profits through the tiny European nation. This includes IKEA which has made an estimated profit of $1.01 billion in profits in Australia since 2003, but has only declared a pre-tax profit of $103 million and paid $31 million in tax, the Australian Financial Review reported. Scroll down for video . The bank quarter in Luxembourg. Leaked documents show how 343 Australian and overseas companies shrink their tax bills by routing their profits through the tiny European nation . An Ikea logo is seen outside a store warehouse in Logan south of Brisbane. The Swedish company has had an estimated profit of $1.01 billion in profits in Australia since 2003, but has only  paid $31 million in tax . ICIJ director Gerard Ryle said the companies featured in the documents – including Australian companies Lend Lease, Macquarie Group, Goodman Group, The Future Fund and AMP – all used different tax structures. 'The emphasis is that all of this is perfectly legal, no one is breaking any laws here,' Mr Ryle told Daily Mail Australia. 'Luxembourg isn't seen as a tax haven, it's seen as a first-world country. 'They're above board and above reproach.' Mr Ryle said the fact that companies were paying small amounts of tax in Australia affected all Australians. 'If companies or individuals aren't paying their fair share of taxes it means we end up paying more,' he said. Investigation leader Gerard Ryle said 'Luxembourg isn't seen as a tax haven, it's seen as a first-world country' 'Essentially it's a simple issue, it's all about fairness.' Mr Ryle said the global corporations use Luxembourg to reduce billions of dollars in taxes, often by setting up subsidiaries or separate entities in the country. Between 2002 and 2013: . 'The idea of doing this all legally is to make sure your profits are being earned in a place where you're being taxed the least,' he said. 'So if you are taxed 10 percent in Australia, you want to earn the money somewhere else where the rate is one percent or less. 'So you might set up an entity in Luxembourg that lends your Australian company money at a high percentage, and then what happens there is you're shifting the profit because the Australian company has to pay interest rates to Luxembourg.' Mr Ryle said Luxembourg received a small percentage of the money but for the country 'it is about volume'. 'If there are billions of dollars going through, even if it's a tiny bit, it's worth their while,' he said, . Mr Ryle added that the documents were studied by tax experts and journalists for almost six months, after smaller investigations in France and the UK. ATO commissioner Chris Jordan has seen the documents and said the tax office had started analysing the data. Pricewaterhouse Coopers helped hundreds of companies lower their tax bills - in some cases to almost zero . 'I want to reaffirm we will be checking the data that has been published and if we see discrepancies from what we've been told we will take audit action,' Mr Jordan said in a statement. 'We have stepped up our commitment and effort to ensure multinationals pay tax in Australia on the income they earn here. 'We are very aware that taking action with those who do not do the right thing is critical to community confidence in our fairness and integrity, and ultimately the sustainability of the system.' A Pricewaterhouse Coopers spokeswoman said the firm provides independent professional advice to clients on a wide range of tax issues. The Australian Tax Office is threatening to take audit action against local companies and major multinational corporations if it finds discrepancies . 'This can include advice on the taxation of potential business transactions in a particular country. We also assist our clients with the preparation of tax returns and with discussions with tax authorities,' she said in a statement. 'All our advice and assistance is given in accordance with applicable local, European and international tax laws and agreements and is guided by the PwC Global Tax Code of Conduct which has been in place since 2005. 'Our client relationships are governed by strict confidentiality; we cannot comment on individual cases.'

"A metal detector-wielding amateur archaeologist may have discovered the legendary hoard that inspired one of Richard Wagner's most epic works of opera. The trove unearthed in Rhineland Palatinate, western Germany, includes silver bowls, brooches, other jewellery from ceremonial robes and small statues that adorned a grand chair, said experts. Amid speculation that it may be the legendary Nibelung hoard, they have valued the haul of gold and silver, which dates back to Roman times, at nearly £826,000.. Stuff of legends: German officials view a silver bowl and plate from Late Antiquity, which are part of what could be the Nibelung hoard which was unearthed in the Rhineland Palatinate, on display in Mainz, Germany . 'It fits in with the epoch of the Nibelung legend': Silver statuettes and metal fittings of a general's chair which were part of the trove. Experts have estimated the value of the treasure to exceed one million euros . A chopped-up silver plate from the hoard: The haul, which was found near Ruelzheim in the southern part of the state, is now at the state cultural department in Mainz, but officials suspect they may not have all of it . 'In terms of timing and geography, the find fits in with the epoch of the Nibelung legend,' Axel von Berg, the state's chief archaeologist was quoted by German media as saying. 'But we cannot say whether it actually belongs to the Nibelung treasure,' he said, adding that whoever owned it had 'lived well' and could have been a prince. The haul, which was found near Ruelzheim in the southern part of the state, is now at the state cultural department in Mainz, but officials suspect they may not have all of it. Prosecutors have begun an inquiry into the man who found the treasure because they suspect he may have sold some of it, possibly to a buyer abroad, the department said. 'The spot where the find was made was completely destroyed by the improper course of action,' it said in a statement. Whether the treasure is the famous 'Rhinegold' or not, it seems to have been buried in haste by its owner or by robbers in around 406-407 AD, when the Roman Empire was crumbling in the area along the Rhine, Mr von Berg said. Golden pieces of jewellery, thought to be from a ceremonial dress: Prosecutors have begun an inquiry into the man who found the treasure because they suspect he may have sold some of it, possibly to a buyer abroad .

Silver statuettes from the 'general's chair': The semi-mythical Nibelung hoard features in Wagner's epic opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring Of The Nibelung), often referred to as the Ring Cycle . The Nibelung hoard features in Wagner's epic opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring Of The Nibelung), often referred to as the Ring Cycle, which follows the struggles of heroes, gods and monsters over a magic ring which grants the power to rule the world. Modelled after ancient Greek dramas, it is a work of extraordinary scale - intended to be performed over four evenings with a total playing time of about 15 hours - that took Wagner 26 years to compose. The cycle is based on the Germanic legend of Siegfried and the mythology surrounding the royal lineage of the Burgundians who settled in the early 5th century at Worms, one of Germany's oldest cities. Ancient: This mashed-up silver-plate is believed to be the decorative metal fitting of a chest. The dating of the hoard coincides with the downfall of the Burgundians in the 5th century, on which the Nibelung legend is based . Historical: This map shows the approximate location where the hoard was discovered, an area dotted with castles and steeped in legend that has inspired generations of German poets, painters and musicians . Drama: The legend of the Nibelung hoard was inspiration for Wagner's Ring Cycle, an epic series of operas that stretches to more than 15 hours and follows the struggles of gods, monsters and heroes over a magic ring . According to the Nibelung legend, the warrior Hagen killed the dragon-slayer Siegfried and sank his treasure in the Rhine river. The Rhine has shifted its course many times over the centuries, so the treasure need no longer be under water.

"Banned cyclist Lance Armstrong says he would cheat again if he was taken back to 1995. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. Imploring the world to forgive him for doping, the Texan said his offenses should be seen in context of sporting culture at the time. 'If you take me back to 1995, when doping was completely pervasive, I would probably do it again,' Armstrong told the BBC in an interview on Monday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Forgive me': Lance Armstrong, 43, has implored the world to forgive him for doping, saying his offenses should be seen in context of an 'imperfect' time. He is pictured, right, winning the 1995 Tour DuPont while doping . 'People don't like to hear that,' he admits. The father-of-five revealed he 'feels bad' but still feels like he justifiably won the seven Tour titles he was later stripped of, saying 'there has to be a winner.' And asked about his doping, Armstrong is quick to make clear he was not alone. 'When I made the decision, when my team made that decision, when the whole peloton made that decision, it was a bad decision and an imperfect time. 'But it happened. And I know what happened because of that. I know what happened to the sport, I saw its growth.' Now, he insists, time's have changed. 'If I was racing in 2015, no, I wouldn't do it again because I don't think you have to.' Armstrong led the world of cycling from 1999 to 2005, after returning to the sport following a battle with testicular cancer. Once a hero to millions, he spent the entirety of his comeback years denying claims that he had engineered one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports.

Finally in 2012 the USADA published a 1,200-page report which found him guilty of taking performance-enhancing drugs. In January 2013, he confessed to doping on national television in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. 'It was this ruthless desire to win. Win at all costs,' he told Oprah. On Monday, the 43-year-old spoke to the BBC's Dan Roan to say the reaction was 'brutal' and he hopes the world is getting close to forgiving him. 'The fallout has been heavy, heavier than even I thought,' he said. 'It was pretty brutal afterwards. It's been tough, it's been trying, it's required some patience, but it seems like there's some light at the end of the tunnel.'

I heard this in the hallway,"" or ""I saw this on social media,"" or ""is this true?"". That would rock me.' Can the world forgive him?

Armstrong believes he has been made to pay a heavy personal price for an offence he says was committed by many, and is hoping for a reduction in his ban after twice speaking with the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC). He also believes his seven Tour titles should be restored. 'I think there has to be a winner, I'm just saying that as a fan,' he said. 'There's a huge block in World War One with no winners, and there's another block in World War Two, and then it seems like there's another world war. 'I don't think history is stupid, history rectifies a lot of things. If you ask me what happens in 50 years, I don't think it sits empty... I feel like I won those Tours.' The one thing that should never be restored is the attitude he had during his hey-day, he says. 'I would want to change the man that did those things, maybe not the decision, but the way he acted,' he continued. 'The way he treated people, the way he couldn't stop fighting.

"Manchester City are sweating on the availability of Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony for their top of the table clash with Chelsea on Saturday – but whether the two Ivorians can play may come down to the luck of the draw. Ivory Coast face Cameroon on Wednesday night knowing that a win will guarantee them a place in the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations, and keep the City stars in Equatorial Guinea for at least another week. But, if they lose, Toure and Bony will head home on Thursday, and could be ready to face Chelsea this weekend. VIDEO Scroll down for Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard previews group D Cameroon clash .

However, things get more complicated if they draw Wednesday’s crucial show-down. The Ivorians could have their fate decided off the pitch, by the drawing of lots. Despite a star-studded line-up of players based at top European clubs, the Elephants have drawn both of their first two games 1-1. And, remarkably, both the other games in the group, which also features Cameroon, Mali and Guinea, have also ended with the same scoreline. That means that, going into the final round of fixtures, all four teams are level on points, head-to-head, goal difference and goals scored. Should that remain the same after Wednesday night’s games, lots would have to be drawn to determine which two sides go through to the quarter-finals, and which two are eliminated. That means if both games end in the same score draw then all four teams will need to be picked out of a hat to determine their position in the group. Bony's debut date for Manchester City could be determined by drawing lots if the group remain dead level . Yaya Toure could be back in time for Manchester City's clash with Chelsea if Ivory Coast are eliminated . But, even if one game ends with a positive result, were the other to be a draw there would still need to be lot drawing to decide who goes through, and who goes out, of the teams that finished level. And, just to complicate matters further, two wins by the same score would see a toss-up to see who finishes first and second in the group. If the sides do need to be separated by picking out of a hat, CAF have confirmed that the draw will take place immediately after the games in Malabo on Wednesday night. But amid all the permutations, Manuel Pellegrini must be quietly hoping that Cameroon can show more cutting edge than in their first two games, freeing his stars to return to Manchester on Thursday morning without relying on luck.

"West Ham striker Diafra Sakho has spoken of his 'sadness and anger' at criticism directed towards him for not representing Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations this month. Sakho was ruled out of the three-week tournament with a back injury, but came off the bench to score the winner on Sunday as the Hammers beat Bristol City 1-0 in the FA Cup fourth round. A number of Senegal fans vented their frustration on Sakho's official Facebook page by posting comments underneath a picture of him celebrating the goal at Ashton Gate. Sakho celebrates after scoring the all-important winner to send West Ham through to the FA Cup fifth round . One wrote: 'So you're not injured?' and another commented: 'Congratulations on your goal, I hope you never play for Senegal again, the Senegalese people feel betrayed.' Sakho responded: 'I took the time to browse all your reactions on social networks. Very quickly my joy from scoring and rescuing my club has turned into sadness and anger. 'Sadness because some of your words touched me deep in my person and my heart and this, without you knowing what has really happened. 'And great anger, because after all my struggles day after day, season after season to finally wear the jersey of my homeland, and my family, the only nation that matters to me - you doubt my love and my patriotism. Sakho leaps to head West Ham into the FA Cup fifth round with a win against Bristol . 'My absence at CAN 2015 (the Africa Cup of Nations), my first CAN, was not painless. 'The dream of contributing to the victory of my country got away from me this year, but it is not dead! 'Never doubt the lion sleeping in me, as I never doubt the passion that burns within you.' Senegal accused West Ham of a 'lack of respect' when the striker withdrew from the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this month and threatened to consult FIFA and the Football Association to prevent the 25-year-old from playing during the competition. Sakho, who has scored 10 goals since moving to Upton Park in the summer, suffered a recurrence of a back injury against West Brom on New Year's Day. The Senegalese striker has scored 10 goals for West Ham since he joined them in the summer . Senegal asked to carry out their own medical assessment on the striker, as is their right according to FIFA rules, but West Ham said Sakho could not fly and suggested Senegal's doctors came to London instead. The Hammers also sent Senegal independent medical reports, as well as the club's own examinations, to prove the extent of the injury. FIFA told Press Association Sport it would not comment on individual cases, but Annexe 1 of its regulations state: 'A player who has been called up by his association for one of its representative teams is, unless otherwise agreed by the relevant association, not entitled to play for the club with which he is registered during the period for which he has been released or should have been released pursuant to the provisions of this annexe. Sakho withdrew from Senegal's AFCON squad with a recurrence of a back injury earlier this month . 'This restriction on playing for the club shall, moreover, be prolonged by five days in the event that the player, for whatsoever reason, did not wish to or was unable to comply with the call-up.' Sakho could feature in two further games before the African Nations Cup ends, as West Ham play Liverpool and Manchester United before the tournament final on February 8.

"Dismissive: Goalkeeper Richard Kingson said 'false spirits' had possessed his wife and forced her to make the embarrassing claims . The wife of a Premier League goalkeeper has claimed to be a witch who put a curse on him to sabotage his career. Richard Kingson - the most capped player in Ghana and former star at Birmingham, Wigan and Blackpool - has not played for his country or had a club since last year. Adelaide Tawiah Kingson went on Nigerian TV two weeks ago to say she had put a spell on her husband to wreck his form - and make him impotent too. The 34-year-old footballer, known as Olele, yesterday took to Facebook to deny that his wife was a witch and blame her comments on ‘false spirits’ that had entered her during a church service, according to News1ghana.com. Mrs Kingson also retracted her claim, which was made live on religious satellite channel Emmanuel TV - the station of SCOAN (The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations). A report from Ghanasoccer.net quoted her as saying: 'I myself had no foreknowledge that I had been possessed. I can’t even remember what took place in the church after I fell down... 'I was only told what the spirit that manifested had said after I regained consciousness. I am not a witch as it has been rumoured... 'My husband knows how inspirational I have been to him throughout his goalkeeping career.' Top level: Kingson, 34, in action for Ghana against Brazilian forward Ronaldo during the 2006 World Cup . Olele said that people who wanted to embarrass him had spiritually manipulated the wife to make the bizarre claims. Speaking at the church a week after the deliverance, Kingson and his wife said all was well in their matrimonial home and that peace and love were restored to their marriage. SCOAN leader, TB Joshua, prophesied to Olele that he would return to the church within a month to report a restoration of his career and encouraged him not to worry about what people said about his wife. Mrs Kingson was credited with saving Ghana's Black Stars from shame in 2006 when she advised her husband not to take a $300,000 bribe to let in two goals during a match against the Czech Republic at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Kingson admitted he had been tempted because the winning bonus for the match had only been $8,000, but was persuaded not to do it after his wife 'said that her love for me was not because of my money.' The goalie said he had been faithful to his spouse since they got engaged in 1997.","She made bizarre claims on a religious TV channel .

"A powerful committee of MPs today demand a ban on fracking in Britain’s National Parks, ancient woodlands and other protected countryside. The Environmental Audit Committee says there should be a moratorium on drilling for shale in the rest of the UK amid concerns including noise and pollution of water supplies. Its report is published as ministers face a rebellion from senior Tories who have warned they could vote against fracking in the House of Commons today. Opposing bill: A powerful committee of MPs today demand a ban on fracking in Britain’s National Parks, ancient woodlands and other protected countryside . The Infrastructure Bill contains measures designed to encourage the controversial energy extraction process, which has slashed energy bills in the US. Former Tory environment secretary Caroline Spelman has called for a ‘moratorium’ on drilling, and Anne McIntosh, chairman of the Commons Environment Committee, whose North Yorkshire constituency contains a proposed fracking site, said the technology was ‘not appropriate’. David Cameron and George Osborne are keen proponents of fracking. The Prime Minister has said the Government was ‘going all out’ to exploit the technology. Ministers also say it will create jobs and growth, reduce energy prices and cut the country’s reliance on gas imports. Supporters: David Cameron and George Osborne are keen proponents of fracking. The Prime Minister has said the Government was ‘going all out’ to exploit the technology . But critics claim the process carries potentially serious environmental risks, and question whether the benefits for the UK would be as great as those enjoyed by the US. Ministers’ enthusiasm for fracking last year was at a time of high energy prices and pressure for action to ease pressure on household power bills. This has since eased with the falling oil price and action by energy firms to cut prices. In its report, the Environmental Audit Committee warns of a an ‘extensive range of uncertainties’ about the possible hazards resulting from fracking, ranging from polluting groundwater and water supplies to noise and disruption. Environmental Audit Committee chairman, Labour MP Joan Walle has spoken out about fracking . Committee chairman, Labour MP Joan Walley said: ‘We cannot allow Britain’s national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty to be developed into oil and gas fields.’ Proposed changes to trespass laws to allow fracking without residents’ permission are, she said, ‘profoundly undemocratic’. The report says extensive development of shale would not be compatible with the UK’s goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It said fracking should be ‘prohibited outright’ in protected areas such as national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and ancient woodlands, and banned in all water source protection zones – where drinking water is taken from. Fracking will not be commercially viable unless it is developed on a large scale, but widespread extraction would lead to greater carbon emissions which would breach Government targets. Some MPs on the committee have tabled an amendment to the Infrastructure Bill calling for a moratorium on fracking for shale gas to reduce the risk the UK misses its targets to cut carbon emissions. The Infrastructure Bill includes measures to make it easier for energy companies to drill under people’s homes without their permission and allows them to leave “any substance” deep underground. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘We disagree with the conclusion of this report. We have one of the most robust regulatory regimes for shale gas. ‘UK shale development is compatible with our goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and does not detract from our support for renewables; in fact it could support development of intermittent renewables.’","Ministers face rebellion from senior Tories likely to vote against fracking .

"Single for 13 years following a bitter divorce, Ann Sanderson, 56, from Devon, thought she would never be loved or wanted ever again. So when she met a 'perfect' man named Michael Evans, 62, on an online dating site, Ms Sanderson was overjoyed. But when, after a whirlwind romance, the couple married in what she describes as a 'dream wedding', she soon discovered that Mr Evans wasn't quite what he seemed. Upsetting: Ann Sanderson, 56, discovered that her husband Mike had another wife and a mistress . Just eight months after their wedding, a surprise letter led to the revelation that not only had Mr Evans not divorced his wife of 40 years, he was having an affair with a third woman as well. Now Ms Sanderson has appeared on Channel 5 documentary, Got Hitched, Got Ditched, to tell the world of her experiences in the hope that it might prevent other women from falling prey to a similar con. Her story began in September 2011, when, encouraged by friends, she decided to try internet dating and set up an account with online match-maker, Plenty of Fish. Several men got in touch, among them Mr Evans, whose persistent emails and seeming kindness caught her eye. Fantastic: Ms Sanderson says her wedding day was 'fantastic' and wonderful in every way . The pair began speaking regularly on the phone. 'It felt nice to have someone phoning and having someone to talk to about all my troubles,' remembers Ms Sanderson. 'It did feel good. He'd tell me about his occupation, his home, his marriage and what had happened in his marriage.' Overjoyed: Ms Sanderson was delighted when Mike popped the question after a few months of dating . Mr Evans was, he said, in the process of divorcing his wife of 40 years and told lurid stories about her drinking habits and vindictive behaviour. Completely taken in, Ms Sanderson agreed to meet him in person for the very first time and, despite feeling nervous ahead of the date, said it proved to be a revelation. 'It was just nice to go out and have some real company,' she says. 'We had a chat and a laugh.' Three months later, the couple decided to book a romantic weekend break in Torquay. 'He said, ""I've got some time off and I can come down. Do you fancy a weekend in Torquay?"" 'I thought yeah, why not. He was being so nice to me so I thought yes, there is something here, I am falling for him.' Her joy was made complete when Mr Evans proposed and suggested taking her to buy an engagement ring the very next day. 'I was gobsmacked at first, so I said let me think about it and I'll let you know,' remembers Ms Sanderson. 'I was just so shocked.' Despite her misgivings, Ms Sanderson said yes and threw herself into planning her dream wedding. 'It was a lovely time,' she remembers. 'I couldn't knock him that way. He did make it special for me. He made it feel as if I was part of his life. 'I was just shocked because I thought nobody wanted me. It was nice. It made me feel safe, secure and wanted.' Ms Sanderson had been living with her son Dan but at Mr Evans' prompting, she found a home in Torquay for the pair to live in. 'He was working away during the week and at weekends, he would come home,' says Ms Sanderson. 'It was nice to have my own space. I could do what I wanted to do during the week.' Soon, the couple's big day arrived.  'I had a fantastic wedding day, from the moment I got up to when I came down and met my friends,' says Ms Sanderson. 'They all supported me, they knew what I'd been through and it was a fantastic day.' But less than two weeks after the wedding, Mr Evans, a lorry driver, began acting strangely, spending some weekends away and turning his phone off for days at a time. 'He had these excuses like he was working in a prison, he had had to turn his phone off or his battery went flat,' she says. 'I thought, No, you don't have your phone off all that time. But I just went along with it because I thought, maybe he is right. Rather than have an argument, let's just go along with it.' Charged: Mike has since been prosecuted for bigamy and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service . Painful: Ms Sanderson says in the aftermath of the break-up, she felt so low she was almost suicidal . The situation continued for eight months with Ms Sanderson still unwilling to confront her husband about his elusive behaviour. Then, one day, a letter arrived. It turned out to be from Mr Evans' son who claimed he was already married and living a double life. When shown the letter, Mr Evans denied everything and, for a while, Ms Sanderson believed him. But a few weeks later, an email appeared in her inbox with the subject line: 'Bigamist'. It turned out to be from a woman who claimed to be dating Mr Evans and repeated what the letter had said. 'I phoned Mike and a lady answered,' remembers Ms Sanderson. 'I asked if Mike was there and she said yes. 'Then I asked her who she was and she said, ""I'm his wife"". I asked her how she could be his wife and said, I'm his wife too.' Heartbroken and furious, Ms Sanderson demanded to speak to Mr Evans, who finally admitted the truth about his double life. Callously, he told her that not only did he not want to be with his wife, he didn't want to be with her either and would rather be with his mistress instead. Moving on: Ms Sanderson says she still cannot understand why Mr Evans insisted on marrying her . Nothing: She says she was devastated to discover that her life with Mr Evans meant 'nothing' to him . A tearful Ms Sanderson told him that she never wanted to hear from him again before slamming down the phone. But worse was to come. Mr Evans immediately stopped paying the rent on their home, leaving Ms Sanderson to be confronted by their angry landlord and given just 20 hours to pack up and leave. 'It was devastating,' she says. 'It just broke my heart. In two weeks, I lost my husband, I lost my home, I lost everything. It was just heartbreaking. 'I lost my identity because one moment I thought I was Mrs, and the next minute, I didn't know what I was.' Ms Sanderson, who remains angry about what happened to her, got so depressed that she even contemplated suicide. 'At the time, I didn't want to live. I just wanted to smash my car up because I felt so low.' Some closure came when, 12 months after the revelations emerged, Mr Evans went on trial for bigamy and was handed 200 hours community service. But she remains baffled by his behaviour. 'He could have just carried on seeing me. But he wanted to get married. He wanted to get married. Not me.' And the consequences of his double life have been devastating. 'I thought I had a marriage and I didn't have a marriage,' she says. 'I thought I had a home, I thought I had a husband but it meant nothing. Everything we went through meant nothing,'","Ann Sanderson, 56, from Devon, discovered she was married to a bigamist .

"A married pastor who ran off with the wife of a local school governor has left his post. Father-of-three Stuart Cathrow has reportedly moved in with Laura Etherington, whose husband is a parent governor of Canary Wharf College. Now parents claim the couple’s actions are damaging the reputation of the leading free school – which is in East London and has been rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. Pastor and his lover: Married pastor Stuart Cathrow and Laure Etherington, who he has reportedly moved in with . ‘It is all out in the open but the school is trying to keep it hush hush and some parents have been told not to say anything,’ said one parent. ‘Many believe it is bringing the school into disrepute.’ It is thought the pair met through their work for the Christian primary. As well as being pastor for a local evangelical church, Mr Cathrow, 43, was chairman of the school’s parents’ association and mother-of-two Mrs Etherington, 34, acted as treasurer. Mr Cathrow’s wife Louise, 46, is leader of learning programmes at the school and is living with their children in the Isle of Dogs. It is not known where banker James Etherington, 35, is living, but he is thought to have left the £1million flat in Limehouse he shared with his wife, son and daughter. Wife and lover: Louise Cathrow is leader of learning programmes at Canary Wharf College while her husband's new lover is a school governor . ‘Laura admitted the affair to the parents’ association during the summer holidays and told them that she and Stuart were together,’ the anonymous parent added. ‘It is not known how long they had been having an affair, but they met while on the association and also ran the London Marathon together last year. They are now living together and go to church together.’ Last night, Mr Cathrow and Mrs Etherington declined to comment on the situation. Quaystone Church could not be reached for comment, however Mr Cathrow last posted a sermon on its website in May and is no longer listed as pastor. Embarassment: Parents at Canary Wharf College (above) claim the couple’s actions are damaging the reputation of the leading free school – which is in East London and has been rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted . He is also said to have stepped down as chairman of the parents’ association, and Mrs Etherington is no longer treasurer. Principal of Canary Wharf College, Sarah Counter, said: ‘Neither the Reverend Stuart Cathrow or Laura Etherington are, or indeed have ever been, contracted employees of the school. ‘This matter is of a personal nature between the adults involved and we respect their right to privacy in the matter.’","Stuart Cathrow moved in with Laura Etherington following their love affair .

"The brains of those diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are distinctly different to those of healthy people, scientists have discovered. The study promises to add weight to the debate over the legitimacy of the condition, which is repeatedly called into question. A team of researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine believe their findings could lead to more definitive diagnoses of the syndrome and better treatments. And it is thought the study could help point to an underlying mechanism governing the disease. It is not uncommon for CFS patients to face misunderstanding of their condition, plagued by suspicions of hypochondria. The brains of those diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are distinctly different to those of healthy people, scientists  have discovered, prompting hopes for better diagnosis and treatment of the condition. File picture . But the abnormalities identified in this study, published in the journal Radiology, will, it is hoped, go some way to helping resolve those ambiguities. Lead author Michael Zeineh, assistant professor of radiology, said: 'This is a very common and debilitating disease. 'It's very frustrating for patients, because they feel tired and are experiencing difficulty thinking, and the science has yet to determine what has gone wrong. 'Using a trio of sophisticated imaging methodologies, we found that CFS patients' brains diverge from those of healthy subjects in at least three distinct ways.' The condition affects between one and four million in the US and millions more worldwide. Putting a definitive figure on the number of sufferers is difficult, because CFS can be difficult to diagnose. While all patients share a common symptom - crushing, unremitting fatigue that persists for six months or longer - additional symptoms can vary from one patient to the next, often overlapping with other conditions. Professor Jose Montoya, the study's senior author, said: 'CFS is one of the greatest scientific and medical challenges of our time. 'Its symptoms often include not only overwhelming fatigue but also joint and muscle pain, incapacitating headaches, food intolerance, sore throat, enlargement of the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal problems, abnormal blood-pressure and heart-rate events, and hypersensitivity to light, noise or other sensations.' The combination of symptoms can devastate a patient's life for decades. In an effort to identify the syndrome's underlying mechanisms, Professor Montoya has been following 200 CFS patients for several years. 'In addition to potentially providing the CFS-specific diagnostic biomarker we've been desperately seeking for decades, these findings hold the promise of identifying the area or areas of the brain where the disease has hijacked the central nervous system,' he said. Dr Zeineh added: 'If you don't understand the disease, you're throwing darts blindfolded. 'We asked ourselves whether brain imaging could turn up something concrete that differs between CFS patients' and healthy people's brains. 'And, interestingly, it did.' The researchers compared brain images of 15 CFS patients chosen from the group Professor Montoya has been following, to those of 14 age and sex-matched healthy volunteers. The volunteers had no history of fatigue or other conditions causing symptoms similar to those of CFS. Their analysis yielded three noteworthy results. First, an MRI scan showed that overall white matter content of CFS patients' brains was reduced compared to that of healthy participants' brains. Researchers at Stanford University found three differences after performing MRIs on a group of CFS patients and a control group of healthy volunteers with no history of CFS. File picture . The term 'white matter' denotes the long, cable-like nerve tracts carrying signals and information through dispersed concentrations of 'grey matter' - which specialise in processing information. While Dr Zeineh said the first finding wasn't entirely unexpected,  the second was. Using advanced imaging techniques, he and his colleagues identified a consistent abnormality in a particular part of a nerve tract in the right hemisphere of CFS patients' brains. The tract, which connects the frontal lobe with the temporal lobe, assumed an abnormal appearance in CFS patients. Furthermore, Dr Zeineh said the study identified a strong link between the degree of abnormality in the patient's tract and the severity of their CFS. The third finding highlighted a thickening of the grey matter in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe in CFS patients, compared with the control group. Dr Zeineh said while their results are 'quite robust', more research is needed. 'This study was a start. It shows us where to look,' he said, adding the team are planning a substantially larger study.","Study at Stanford University examined MRI scans of CFS patients comparing them to those of healthy volunteers .

CFS patients found to have lower levels of white matter - which carries information and signals between different parts of the brain .

"The beautiful texts of ancient Greece have captivated our imaginations for thousands of years. From the tragedies of Sophocles to the epics of Homer, modern literature throughout the world continues to be inspired by these classics. But the haunting music these poems were originally sung to have long since been lost, with researchers instead focusing on the meaning of the words. Scroll down to listen to the music... The music of ancient Greece, which hasn't been heard for more than 2,000 years, is being reconstructed by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University . Now an expert from Oxford University has reconstructed the music, and rediscovered some of the instruments that played them - and he claims the recordings are 100 per cent accurate. ‘There is no question that we can reconstruct what this fascinating music sounded like,’ Dr Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University, told MailOnline. ‘We have been left with clear instructions, thousands of years old, about how to create instruments used to play the music with mathematical precision.’ One of the great Greek lyrists and few known female poets of the ancient world, Sappho was born some time between 630 and 612 BC. Her love poetry would have been composed to music, such as the tune heard above . The result, according to Dr D'Angour, is ‘something quite magical’ which may sound odd to our ears, but was hugely popular with audiences at the time. To reconstruct the music, Dr D'Angour and his team put together existing clues about the tunes, rhythms and the instruments of the time. The rhythms, for instance, are preserved in the patterns of long and short syllables in the words of the texts themselves. The instruments used – such as lyre and reed-pipes -  are known from, paintings and archaeological remains. The instruments used - such as lyre and reed-pipes -  are known from, paintings and archaeological remains, such as this illustration from The Odyssey by Homer . The lyre (left) is a string instrument known for its use in Greek classical antiquity and later. The right image shows the Seikilos epitaph, the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition. The song is in the ancient Greek musical notation, was found engraved on a tombstone, near Aidin, Turkey . Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear, said Dr D'Angrour. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated as: . While you’re alive, shine: . Never let your mood decline. We’ve a brief span of life to spend: . Time necessitates an end. Meanwhile, ancient documents found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, reveal exactly how the pitch should have risen throughout the composition. Inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, the documents show alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words that reveal the mathematical ratios of musical intervals. Dr D'Angour said that similar music to that played in ancient Greece can today found in the folk music traditions of Sardinia and Turkey, providing an insight into the sounds and techniques used. For instance, in ancient Greece, a musical note would go up in pitch on certain syllables and fall on others, rather than being stressed. 'One of the things Greeks were fascinating by at all times was the notion of imitation,' said Dr D'Angour. Pictured is artwork from the Ambrosian Iliad, a 5th century illuminated manuscript of the Iliad of Homer, depicting a battle scene. This poem may would have been set to music to enhance the emotions it evoked . The music of this period also used delicate intervals such as quarter-tones, and the melody was often different to the vocal pitches used in the poems. ‘We’re talking about a period of around 1000 years so there was lots of different styles and sounds that many of which would have been lost,’ said Dr D'Angour. ‘In so far as we’re aware of different sounds the earliest music, say from 5th C BC, are more alien to us that the later music from 200 AD, which sounds a bit like early church melodies.’ Dr D'Angour has only just begun his collaborative two-year project, at the end of which he hopes to uncover exactly what music meant to ancient Greeks. ‘One of the things Greeks were fascinating by at all times was the notion of imitation,’ said Dr D'Angour. ‘The idea that they could find auditory phenomena that could imitate emotion meant that the music had to feel like it had some kind of enhanced meaning. ‘Some of it absolutely haunting but one of the things I feel most of all is that it’s amazing to hear music that hasn’t been heard for 2,000 years.’","Musical rhythms were preserved in the patterns of words of ancient texts .

"Victor Valdes has already made a huge impact at Manchester United - thanks to the inspirational tale of a man who ran marathons with his disabled son. The three-times Champions League winner, who is yet to make his first-team bow, shared the heartwarming story of American Dick Hoyt and cerebal palsy-suffering Rick at a team meeting at the club's Aon training complex. After Valdes made his first start in United's Under 21 victory over Liverpool, coach Warren Joyce lifted the lid on an emotional morning at Carrington recently, which left few in any doubt about what kind of man they were dealing with. Victor Valdes wore a Manchester United No 1 shirt for the first time on Monday night in an Under 21 match . The former Barcelona star helped United's youngsters beat their rivals from Liverpool at Leigh Sports Village . CLICK HERE to read more about Victor Valdes's first appearance in goal wearing Manchester United colours. 'We have motivational speeches on Friday mornings where the lads have to find out their own information and give a speech,' Joyce told Sportsmail. 'We were in the room and I was going to do something. He said ""(Pep) Guardiola used to do this"" and ""I've got one or two"".' Valdes, one of three players over 21 chosen in Monday night's 2-1 win, then took over and shared the remarkable tale with his younger colleagues, using video clips. When Rick was born in 1962 doctors told his dad he would be a 'vegetable' and advised him to put his son into an institution. Valdes, Joel Castro Pereira, Anderson, Andreas Pereira, Jesse Lingard and Saidy Janko celebrate the win . United defender Paddy McNair (right) celebrates scoring the 47th-minute winner against Liverpool . Dick had no such ideas and raised him along with his other two sons at the family's home in Massachusetts with the aid of a computer which allowed Rick to communicate. One day, in the spring of 1977, Rick came home from school and told his dad he wanted to run a five-mile charity race for a Lacrosse player who had been paralysed in an accident. Dick pushed his son in his wheelchair and they completed the run together. Later that night Rick, who would go on to graduate from Boston University, told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not handicapped.' That sparked the creation of Team Hoyt which, after bringing the curtain down at last year's Boston Marathon, had completed in 1,108 events including 255 triathlons and 72 marathons. Dick Hoyt (left) has pushed his disabled son Rick (right) in a special wheelchair in over 1,000 events . The father and son team have competed together since the 1970s . Rick told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not . handicapped.' Rick, pictured being pulled in a dinghy by his father during a triathlon, has cerebral palsy . 'The boy asks his dad to run and the dad says yes,' Joyce said. 'The next clip he says ""can we do a triathlon?"" and they do the Ironman. 'So dad pushes him for the run, he's got him in a dinghy as he swims and the last bit he's got him on the front of a bike. 'The meaning at the end is: don't anybody say I can't - I can. 'I played the video and he talked through it - it was brilliant.' Joyce branded 33-year-old Valdes, who joined on a free transfer from Barcelona after suffering a serious knee injury last year, a 'model pro'.

And Joyce added that at half-time, with a side including the likes of Nick Powell, Anderson, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair level at 1-1, he told some of his charges to follow the World Cup winner's example. 'I thought he was more focused than a couple of the ones who have played for first team and have been out on loan coming back to this level,' he explained. 'I didn't think some of the first-team lads were as up for it as he was, so there was a couple of stern words at half-time.'","Victor Valdes has worn Manchester United No 1 shirt for first time .
