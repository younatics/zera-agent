"(CNN) -- For one minute on Wednesday night, the marquee lights of Broadway went dark in honor of Philip Seymour Hoffman's memory. The 46-year-old actor was a respected and vital member of New York's theater community, as was evidenced by the outpouring of mourners who showed up for a candlelight vigil held by the LAByrinth Theatre Company, of which Hoffman was a member and an artistic director. He was found dead in his New York apartment of an apparent drug overdose Sunday. The Philip Seymour Hoffman we didn't know . ""We come together in a spirit of terrible mourning and incredible loss,"" LAByrinth member and Jesuit priest Father Jim Martin told the crowd gathered in front of the Bank Street Theater. ""But we also come together to celebrate a remarkable life."" Across Hollywood, a number of Hoffman's colleagues are offering similar tributes as they cope with his death. Philip Seymour Hoffman: Piecing together his final hours . ""It's a shock, a total shock,"" Hoffman's ""Hunger Games"" co-star Elizabeth Banks told ""Extra!"" on Wednesday. ""He was an incredible actor; everyone respected and loved him. I really enjoyed my time with him. We were playing against each other in Candy Crush just last week. So I'm really, really, really sad."" And to Aaron Sorkin, another venerated creator whose bond with Hoffman cemented during their work on 2007's ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" Hoffman's death may become someone else's saving grace. In a tribute in Time magazine, Sorkin recalls the ""mini-AA meetings"" he and Hoffman would have on the Paramount lot while on breaks, stretches of time where they could share stories as fathers of young kids and as recovering drug addicts. ""I told him I felt lucky because I'm squeamish and can't handle needles. He told me to stay squeamish,"" Sorkin writes. ""And he said this: 'If one of us dies of an overdose, probably 10 people who were about to won't.' He meant that our deaths would make news and maybe scare someone clean."" In the end, Sorkin believes, that will be added to his already astonishing history. ""(Hoffman) didn't die because he was partying too hard or because he was depressed -- he died because he was an addict on a day of the week with a 'y' in it,"" Sorkin said. ""He'll have his well-earned legacy -- his Willy Loman that belongs on the same shelf with Lee J. Cobb's and Dustin Hoffman's, his Jamie Tyrone, his Truman Capote and his Academy Award. Let's add to that 10 people who were about to die who won't now.""","On February 5, Broadway dimmed its lights for Philip Seymour Hoffman .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Two hostages working for the United Nations were freed hours after they were taken in the Yemeni capital on Tuesday, an official told CNN. The senior Interior Ministry official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. The Ministry released a statement announcing the hostage incident in Sanaa ""has ended after Yemeni forces freed an Italian national. ""The kidnappers were detained by the authorities,"" it said in a statement. It was not immediately clear why the Ministry statement only mentioned one hostage, but the official said one was Italian and one was Yemeni-Italian. The incident took place in Hadda district, considered one of the safest and heavy guarded areas in Sanaa, on Tuesday evening. ""The militants were able to escape, but security checkpoints throughout the capital have been alerted,"" the senior Interior Ministry official told CNN earlier. ""Local council officials in Sanaa have also been asked to inform residents in their areas and keep watch within Sanaa neighborhoods in case the kidnappers choose to hide within Sanaa."" A U.N. official, declining to be named, confirmed the kidnapping of the employees to CNN. No further details were immediately available. Kidnapping has long been a problem in Yemen, with tribes often using foreign nationals as bargaining chips in their dealings with the central government. But the past 24 months have proven even more dangerous for foreigners. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network. Over the last few months, several foreigners have been kidnapped in Yemen, mainly by militants who have turned to kidnapping for huge financial gains.

"(CNN) -- We always want answers. NFL linebacker Jovan Belcher, 25, shot to death the mother of his child, and then shot himself in the head in the middle of the afternoon Saturday outside the team's Kansas City practice facility. The day before, a man killed his father's live-in girlfriend and then burst into a Wyoming college classroom where his father taught and killed him, police said. The man then ended his own life. Experts who spoke with CNN say there are about 1,500 murder-suicide incidents in the United States every year. In comparison, there were 14,612 murders in 2011, the FBI says, and 38,364 suicides in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 1,500 figure is questionable, experts caution, because there are no official statistics on this kind of crime -- the FBI doesn't keep track, and police classify murders in different ways. This lack of certainty often amplifies the frustration people feel when loved ones are wrenched from them so violently. And it makes it even tougher to understand when the violence is wrought in public. Here's what we know from research about murder-suicides: . -- Fathers who kill their children, then themselves, are usually older than the mothers. -- Older couples in murder-suicides are more likely to have medical illnesses. -- Older men are more likely to kill themselves. -- Younger couples are more likely to have a history of verbal discord. -- Firearms are the favored weapon. -- Victims are overwhelmingly female. -- Estrangement is typically the biggest contributing factor. Leaving the living to question everything . Fourteen years ago, Jamie Righter's brother was estranged from his former fiancee. The couple had trouble conceiving and were seeking fertility treatments. She had a relationship with another person and became pregnant, Righter told CNN, and her brother was incensed. Fueled by alcohol, the brother killed the ex-fiancee and then himself. ""My brother was never violent or abusive a day in his life,"" she said. ""Nobody ever expected this. My brother was the kid next door. I have spent years trying to understand."" Righter and her mother formed the Community Awareness and Support Center in Oregon specifically for family members of people who had committed murder-suicides. ""I feel like there's nobody who is telling their story,"" she said. ""I feel like all you do is struggling, and you go back and you go back, and what could we have seen or done? The living are faced with what is left. ""You are called 'murderer's family.' People harass. They talk. It can be very hard."" On top of the pain of that, she must also grieve the loss of her brother, whom she loved very much. ""It's been 14 years, and I still cry for what he did,"" she said. ""My mom gets calls all the time from people who've had a murder-suicide in their family. They ask her, 'How do you continue to live?' "" It took Righter's mother several years to decide she wanted to live because she felt so guilty for what her son had done. They lost family and friends because, Righter said, ""they just couldn't deal with it, or couldn't handle watching her cry."" ""We feel anger, too. We feel so much,"" she added. ""So all we can do is tell our story, and keep telling it."" Raising alarms . Each story is different. But mental health professionals believe there are generally two types of people whose behavior could set off alarm bells as possible attackers. One is a ""middle-aged man who is recently separated or facing pending estrangement from an intimate partner and who is depressed and has access to firearms,"" writes Dr. Scott Eliason. ""The other is an ""an older male who is the primary caregiver for a spouse who is ill or debilitated, where there is a recent onset of new illness in the male, depression and access to firearms."" That's according to a study Eliason published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. Related: manhood, football and suicide . Sometimes, people want to kill themselves because they perceive someone has stopped loving them. The person who is perceived as withholding affection becomes a target. ""A person who is miserable about the loss of affection in their life achieves compatibility again with this person by execution,"" said Dr. Frank Campbell, the executive director of the Baton Rouge Crisis Intervention Center in Louisiana. He's been studying suicide for more than two decades and travels around the world to investigate suicide scenes. ""When one commits murder-suicide, they create acceptable consequences to them -- they are now with that person in a way they can control,"" Campbell said. Related: Chiefs play on . Why some kill in public . Because murder-suicide statistics aren't readily available, it's not possible to be sure how many happen in public spaces, like in Kansas City and Wyoming. But choosing a public space, or at least doing it in front of other people, is a way to make a ""major statement,"" said Dr. Nadine Kaslow, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Often these are impulsive acts, too,"" she said. ""There's just no way to know what was going through someone's head."" Public murder-suicide can be an act of communication, Campbell said. It's a way of acting out frustration and pain that cannot be conveyed in another way. And though it's typically between two people who know each other, the label murder-suicide includes mass killings, after which the killer or killers end their lives. Experts mention infamous Columbine High School killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; or Seung-Hui Cho, the college student who killed 32 others before taking his life at Virginia Tech in 2007. There's a lot of looking in the rear-view mirror, too. The spider web of people who are affected by a murder-suicide -- friends, family, even the community that sees it in the news -- are burdened to look for hints they might have missed. So know this: Sometimes, people contemplating suicide warn us, said Dr. Charles Raison, a CNN contributor and an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. ""People who kill themselves often will tell someone ahead of time,"" he wrote for CNN after the suicide of filmmaker Tony Scott. ""Any such communications should be taken with utmost seriousness, and all efforts should be made to keep the person safe and get him or her to appropriate treatment immediately."" Nearly every person affected by a murder-suicide anguishes over what they might have missed to prevent it or get someone help, Campbell said. Joe Linta, Belcher's agent, had trouble finding words to express his feelings. ""You just ... the how and the why ... is the craziness of this,"" he said. ""There was nothing in my relationship with him that would indicate any troubling past, anything that troubled him ..."" ""Maybe he knew he had to take his own life after what he had done,"" the agent wondered. ""We'll never know, unfortunately.""","NEW: Woman whose brother committed murder-suicide: ""You are called 'murderer's family' ""

"(CNN) -- It was the first tie out -- and it's the tie everyone is talking about. Manchester City will face Barcelona in the last 16 of the European Champions League in what promises to be one of the most eagerly awaited contests in this year's competition. City, which has been in irrepressible form at home in the English Premier League and won at defending champion Bayern Munich last week, had failed to reach this stage in each of its previous two attempts. Now it will face a Barcelona side which has won the tournament on four occasions -- but director of football Txixi Beguiristain says City will not fear his former club. ""I think it will be a great match,"" he told City's official website. ""Ours is a team with a lot of confidence especially after winning against the champions in Munich -- that will give us a lot of confidence. Not just at home but away as well. ""We have to be confident because of the way we are playing. We are showing that we can score in all matches. This is important in the Champions League. ""We scored in Plzen, in Moscow, in Munich -- it should give us confidence to play against a team who have been champions many times. ""Our manager knows Barcelona perfectly because he managed in Spain for a long time. In this sense, we are confident. ""I think the text messages will be flying between Manchester and Barcelona now between Sergio and Lionel! If you want to win the Champions League you have to beat the biggest teams, Barcelona are one of the biggest teams."" City has spent the past few years modeling itself on Barcelona -- now it is aiming to supplant it in Europe's top club competition. Under the management of Manuel Pellegrini, the former Villarreal and Real Madrid coach, City has progressed to the last 16 of the competition for the very first time. Backed by the riches of Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, City has used its financial muscle to lure those who enjoyed great success at Barcelona. Beguiristain worked at the Camp Nou from 2003-10 before joining City to work alongside Ferran Soriano, who joined following a spell with the Catalan club as vice-president. Only last January, Barcelona president Sandro Rosell accused City of trying to poach players and coaching staff from the Camp Nou. One former Barcelona player who is expected to star for City is Yaya Toure -- the midfielder who left for England in July 2010. The contest will also see City's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero, who will hope to have recovered from a calf injury after being ruled out for up to a month, go up against international teammate Lionel Messi. And while neutrals will be salivating at the prospect of the two heavyweight giants going head-to-head, Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino says both teams would have rather avoided one another. ""City will not have wanted to play against Barcelona either,"" he told reporters. ""What we need to concentrate on is being in good shape when February comes around. We need to have a high level and sustain it. ""They are scoring goals with ease so we are not going to discover them now. We want to play well in the tie and obviously win it."" Elsewhere, defending champion Bayern Munich will take on Arsenal in a repeat of last season's clash at the same stage. Bayern triumphed 3-1 in north London before squeaking through to the quarterfinals on away goals following a 2-0 home defeat. Arsenal, which sits top of the Premier League despite Saturday's 6-3 defeat at Manchester City, will provide a tough test for Bayern, according to chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""They are the leaders in the Premier League and so we have been warned,"" he told reporters. ""A few months ago we lost to them in Munich. They are a very tough team."" In 2012, Didier Drogba struck the winning penalty as Chelsea pulled off an unlikely Champions League triumph by defeating Bayern in the final in Munich. Now at Galatasaray, Drogba will return to Stamford Bridge to face his beloved Blues in what promises to be an emotional reunion. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had predicted that his side would be paired with the Turkish club, which defeated Juventus in a dramatic final group game to seal its place in the last 16. Real Madrid has been paired with German side Schalke, with Carlo Ancelotti's men still harboring ambitions of winning ""La Decima"" -- the club's 10th title. Real, which sits third in Spain, has not won the competition since 2002 and was beaten by Borussia Dortmund in last year's semifinal. Dortmund, which was beaten in last season's final by Bayern, will travel to Russia to take on Zenit St Petersburg in the first leg. Manchester United will be favorite to progress to the quarterfinal stage after being paired with Greek side Olympiakos. David Moyes' side, which finished top of its group despite unconvincing domestic form, last won the competition in 2008. Seven-time winner AC Milan has been handed a testing tie against Atletico Madrid. Milan, which has endured a dismal season in Serie A, will face an Atletico side sitting level on points with Barcelona at the top of La Liga. Elsewhere, French champion Paris Saint-Germain will travel to Bayer Leverkusen for its first leg tie. Last-16 draw: . Manchester City vs Barcelona . Olympiakos vs Manchester United .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Fast & Furious"" star Paul Walker may have initially survived a horrific car crash but died moments later of a combination of injuries from the impact and the resulting fire, according to a coroner's report. The one-page preliminary report released by the Los Angeles County coroner's office Wednesday listed the cause of the actor's death as the ""combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries."" An autopsy concluded that Roger Rodas, who was driving the red Porsche Carrera GT, suffered ""multiple traumatic injuries,"" but it was not clear in the report if he was still alive when the car burst into flames soon after the wreck. Since two different doctors did the separate autopsies, the difference in the description of their injuries does not mean the deaths were significantly different, Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told CNN. It is not known how long each man lived after the crash as the fire began, Winter said. That information may be included when full autopsy reports are released in several weeks, he said. The coroner confirmed what many witnesses told investigators: Rodas was the driver in the crash; Walker was the passenger of the high-performance Porsche that clipped a light pole and a tree before erupting in flames on a Southern California street Saturday afternoon. The deaths were officially ruled an accident by the coroner. 'Fast & Furious' halts production . A toxicology report, which could show if drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident, will be available in six to eight weeks, the report said. Video obtained by CNN from a security camera posted on a building on the opposite side of the street from the crash suggests that the fire that engulfed the Porsche did not erupt until about a minute after the car crashed. In the video, which does not show the car, black smoke is seen rising from the crash scene 60 seconds after the light pole and a tree fall. Smoke is faintly visible above the scene after one minute, followed by a heavy plume of black smoke after two minutes. The crash happened on a wide street in a business park in Santa Clarita, California, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. Walker was attending a holiday toy donation event for his charity, Reach Out WorldWide, when he hopped into the car with Rodas for a ride, witnesses said. The Porsche, which was one of only a few hundred made, was on display at the event, which was held at a high-performance car shop owned by Rodas. Minutes after the two men drove away, people at the event heard the crash about 500 yards away, witnesses said. Big questions in Walker crash probe . Next 'Fast & Furious' on hold . Production of Walker's latest movie -- the seventh installment in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise -- will be shut down ""for a period of time,"" the studio said Wednesday. ""At this time we feel it is our responsibility to shut down production on 'Fast & Furious 7' for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise,"" Universal Pictures said in a statement. The studio also said it would donate ""a percentage of proceeds from the upcoming home entertainment release of 'Fast & Furious 6'"" to Walker's charity. ""With the passing of Paul, the world has lost a man who spent a great deal of his life in service to others,"" Universal Pictures Chairman Donna Langley said. ""We share in the deep grief of his family, friends and the countless fans who love him."" Stories of Walker's incredible generosity have become a major aspect to coverage of the actor's death. CNN confirmed one story from a decade ago when Walker noticed a young U.S. soldier shopping with his fiancee for a wedding ring in a Santa Barbara jewelry store. ""The groom was just back from duty in Iraq, and he was going to be deployed again soon and wanted to buy a wedding ring, but he said he just could not afford it,"" saleswoman Irene King told CNN. ""I don't think the soldier realized how expensive those rings are, about $10,000."" ""Walker called the manager over and said, 'Put that girl's ring on my tab,'"" she said. ""Walker left all his billing info, and it was a done deal. The couple was stunned. She was thrilled and could not believe someone did this."" King called it ""the most generous thing I have ever seen."" Walker and Rodas had planned Saturday as a day to help survivors of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The car shop website invited customers to a ""Charity Toy Drive & Automotive Social Gathering."" Why this Porsche is not a car to mess with . Box office success . Walker's career began on the small screen, first with a commercial for Pampers diapers when he was 2, and then with parts in shows such as ""Highway to Heaven"" and ""Touched by an Angel."" His first few movie roles were as supporting characters in teen flicks, most notably in ""Varsity Blues."" But his career really took off when he was cast as undercover cop Brian O'Conner infiltrating a street-racing gang in 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious."" The box office success of the surprise summer hit yielded numerous sequels. And along with Vin Diesel, Walker was one of the franchise stalwarts. The six ""Fast & Furious"" films sold a total of $2.6 billion in tickets worldwide, according to BoxOfficeMojo. Walker wasn't just a car enthusiast on the silver screen; off screen, the actor competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series. On his verified Twitter account, Walker described himself as an ""outdoorsman, ocean addict, adrenaline junkie ... and I do some acting on the side."" Walker also is the star of ""Hours,"" an independent film scheduled to be released December 13 about a father struggling to keep his newborn infant alive after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.","Coroner: Paul Walker died from ""combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries""

"(CNN) -- Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has fired a shot across the bow of business-as-usual at the Pentagon by announcing significant cuts in the U.S. Army. Trimming the active component of the Army from 580,000 to 450,000 would hardly take us back to the interwar Army of 280,000 that gave birth to great wartime leaders like Dwight Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, George A. Patton or Douglass MacArthur, but it still represents a significant reduction in manpower. It undoubtedly will start World War III on the Hill and among other elements of what Ike referred to as our ""military-industrial complex,"" but Hagel should hold the line as the time is ripe for an audacious move on this front. He should stand by these cuts for three reasons: . First, if we are serious about trimming federal spending, the Department of Defense and the military can't be exempt from the budget fight. According to The National Priorities Project, only 30% of the federal budget is made up of discretionary spending, and of that fraction, defense makes up nearly 60% of what we might possibly trim. While modern weapons systems have astronomical price tags, the dirty secret is that one of the biggest lines in the Pentagon's budget is personnel costs -- primarily salaries and health care -- that constitute 26% of the Defense Department's 2014 request of $527 billion. Given that the Army is the most manpower intensive of our services, it is inevitable that it will have to bear the brunt of these cuts. Second, after two long and inconclusive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is unlikely that the American public would rally round the flag for another major exercise in nation-building and counter-insurgency. Get real, Hagel tells nation in proposing military cuts . The sort of military missions the public is likely to support -- special operations-led counter-terrorism strikes, remote-controlled drone campaigns to mop up al Qaeda and indirect military assistance to beleaguered allies -- do not require the hundreds of thousands of boots on the ground that swelled the ranks of the Army over the past decade. Indeed, for the foreseeable future, the services most likely to constitute the tip of the spear for U.S. military missions will be the Navy and the Air Force, whose personnel requirements for missions to keep the peace between China and its neighbors or wage drone and cyber wars are unlikely to be very large. Finally, the dark cloud of large-scale defense reductions may have a silver lining: Bold budget cuts constitute opportunities to subject old and obsolete ways of doing business to the sort of ""creative destruction"" that economist Joseph Schumpeter thought was the genius of capitalism. Although the analogy is by no means perfect, military historians have chronicled instances in which periods of deep budget and manpower cuts have produced great periods of strategic innovation. The German military after World War I and the U.S. military after Vietnam are two examples of organizational adversity leading to strategic quantum leaps. Gov. Haley: Cuts to National Guard a 'slap in the face' Cuts of this depth will undoubtedly force the United States to further trim its military presence overseas. Iraqi President Nouri al-Maliki already showed us the door with his refusal to sign a status of forces agreement covering the small number of residual forces we had hoped to leave in his country. Afghan President Hamid Karzai is turning out to be equally inhospitable. But there is significant U.S. Army presence in Europe and Korea. If we had to choose, we could more safely draw down further on the continent than we could on the Korean Peninsula. Aside from a possible land war in Korea, most of our strategic pivot to Asia is in response to possible Chinese naval challenges which do not require much ground power. Such deep cuts will be painful -- both politically for the administration and directly for our men and women in uniform -- and so should not be implemented cavalierly. On the other hand, to paraphrase Napoleon, if we want to make significant cuts, we should ""do it energetically and with severity. This is the only way to make it shorter, and consequently less inhuman."" Our military and our country will be better off in the long run. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Desch.","Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced significant cuts to the U.S. Army .

"(CNN) -- Unidentified men attack journalists, brandishing guns, and snatch cameras. Local television channels are suddenly blocked or replaced. An international news organization is told by a hotel manager to stop broadcasting. These are just some tales from the field in Crimea, the embattled Ukrainian peninsula that's at the heart of the struggle between Moscow, Kiev and the West. As the world watches a region on the brink of war, stories of harassment and internal pressures are making headlines. A U.N. envoy was threatened by armed men and driven out of the country. A Ukrainian worker must think carefully before answering his boss' question: ""Are you for Ukraine or for Russia?"" European military observers, invited by the Ukrainian government, are stopped at a checkpoint by armed and masked men, one of whom says in Russian: ""I've been ordered by the government of Crimea not to let anyone in."" It's on the media to help provide an accurate picture of what's happening on the ground in Crimea. And now that picture is becoming more difficult to paint. Some would say, what's happening, is downright disturbing. A security camera in Simferopol, Crimea's capital, captured the image of a Bulgarian freelance journalist and his assistant being attacked. CNN's Michael Holmes said the two were spotted as they filmed masked men ""removing TV equipment from another television outfit and basically stealing it."" When those men saw that they were being filmed, Holmes learned, they pounced -- wrestling the journalist to the ground, snatching the equipment and at one point even holding a gun to the journalist's head. In signs that the pro-Russian Crimean authorities are clamping down on dissent within the peninsula, at least two Ukrainian channels, 1+1 and Channel 5, have been blocked from ground-based broadcasting. The head of 1+1 told CNN that Russian state TV outlet Channel One is now broadcasting on its frequency. And now, CNN, too, is feeling some heat. ""Tensions are high, even where we are at this hotel,"" CNN's Ann Coren told Wolf Blitzer during a Thursday broadcast from the confines of a hotel room. ""Management came and approached us and told us that we are no longer allowed to broadcast from this hotel."" The assumption, she said, is that the hotel is kowtowing to outside forces, either the Crimean government, which is known to be pro-Russian, or local militia. CNN has not shied away from reporting about Russian forces being on the ground in Crimea, which Russian President Vladimir Putin denies, and that may have ruffled feathers. ""We've been operating here for over a week -- happily, no problems whatsoever. But obviously somebody is putting pressure on the manager of this hotel and basically threatening to shut us down and kick us out,"" Coren said. ""Hopefully, hopefully, tomorrow we'll still be here."" CNN's Matthew Chance, Diana Magnay, Ben Wedeman and Tim Schwarz also contributed to this report.","Journalists are threatened, cameras stolen, channels blocked .

"(CNN) -- An escaped jail inmate turned himself in just so that he could warm up -- that's how cold the U.S. has been this week. With the country swept with unforgiving weather since December due to a distorted polar vortex, Brimson in Minnesota plunged to -40 Celcius (-40 Fahrenheit: this is the point at which the temperature scales meet) on Wednesday while Chicago saw its record low of -27 C (-16.6 F) on Monday. As dangerously cold as it seems to be, however, it's (fortunately) still a long way from beating the world's lowest temperature record. ""Everybody is interested in extremes -- the hottest, the wettest, the windiest -- so creating a database of professionally verified records is useful in that fact alone,"" says Randall Cerveny from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). With that in mind, what other extreme weather records are there? Cerveny helped us pick out a few highlights from around the world. Lowest temperature . According to WMO, the lowest temperature noted was -89.2 C, recorded on July 21, 1983, in Vostok, Antarctica. Yes, Celsius, not Fahrenheit. In the latter, that's minus 128.5 degrees. An absence of solar radiation, clear skies, little vertical mixing, calm air for a long duration and high elevation (3,420 meters, 11,220 feet) accounted for the frigid weather. Highest temperature . With an average high of 46.7 C (116 F) in July, summer in Death Valley, California, can be baking. But it was the summer of 1913 that entered the record books, acknowledged officially as the hottest temperature ever recorded at 56.7 C (134 F) in recent years, according to WMO. Greatest rainfall in one minute, Unionville . This record is owned by Unionville, Maryland, where on July 4, 1956, 1.22 inches (31.2 millimeters) of rain fell in one minute. To give you an idea -- in sub-tropical Hong Kong, the most severe black rainstorm signal will be hoisted if the rainfall exceeds 70 millimeters (2.75 inches) in an hour. Greatest rainfall in 24 hours . The biggest rainfall in a day occurred with the passage of Cyclone Denise in Foc-Foc, La RÃ©union, an island in the southern Indian Ocean. Some 1.825 meters (71.8 inches) of rain fell over 24 hours, from January 7 to 8, 1966. Heaviest hailstone, Bangladesh . The heaviest hailstone was discovered during a hailstorm in Gopalganj, Bangladesh on April 14, 1986. The storm killed 92 people and included one hailstone that weighed 1.02 kilos (2.25 pounds). Longest recorded dry period, Arica . The longest dry period in history was measured in years. There was not a single raindrop in Arica, Chile, for more than 14 years, from October 1903 to January 1918 -- a total of 173 months. Highest cold water geyser . Located in Andernach, Germany, Geysir Andernach usually blows water from 30 to 60 meters (98 feet to 197 feet) high. The highest ejection reached 61.5 meters (201.7 feet), recorded on September 19, 2002. Cold-water geysers are different from naturally occurring hot-water geysers. The cold underground water erupts from a drilled well. The Andernach well is more than 350 meters (1,148 feet) deep. Coldest road . The Kolyma Highway (M56) in Russia is the coldest road on Earth -- temperatures once plunged to -67.7 degrees C (-89.8 F). A section of the 2,031-kilometer (1,262-mile) highway is called the ""Road of Bones"" to commemorate the prisoners from the Sewostlag Labour Camp who died constructing the road and were buried beneath it. Largest non-polar ice field . You don't need to live in the polar regions to be stuck in the middle of a vast ice field. The largest ice field outside the Poles is Yukon Territory in Canada, inside the 21,980-square-kilometer (8,486-square-mile) Kluane National Park and Reserve. Largest desert . No, not the Sahara. A desert is defined as an area that has no or very little rainfall. The largest desert in the world is Antarctica, which is 14 million kilometers squared (5.4 million square miles) and records only 50 millimeters (2 inches) of precipitation per year. The 9.1-million-kilometer-square (3.5 million square miles) Sahara, according to Guinness World Records, is only the biggest hot desert. Inhabited place with the lowest temperature . The coldest permanently inhabited place is the Siberian village of Oymyakon, Russia. The temperature once dropped to -68 C (-90.4 F) in 1933 -- the coldest temperature recorded outside Antarctica. Some extreme weather records are provided by Guinness World Records. The latest edition of Guinness World Records 2013 was released on September 13, 2012.

"(CNN) -- Iwao Hakamada holds the most dubious of records: Convicted of a 1966 quadruple murder, he is the world's longest-serving death row inmate, according to Amnesty International. That record was capped Thursday when, after almost 48 years, a local court reopened Hakamada's case, Amnesty and Japanese media reported. The Shizuoka District Court suspended his death sentence and released Hakamada after DNA testing indicated key evidence against him may have been fabricated, reported NHK, the Japanese public broadcasting organization. The court said keeping him detained any longer would be unjust, NHK reported. Prosecutors have four days to appeal the court's ruling, but Amnesty International's East Asia research director said it would be ""most callous and unfair"" to challenge the court's decision. ""Time is running out for Hakamada to receive the fair trial he was denied more than four decades ago,"" Roseann Rife said. ""If ever there was a case that merits a retrial, this is it. Hakamada was convicted on the basis of a forced confession, and there remain unanswered questions over recent DNA evidence."" NHK video showed several men in blue uniforms, some wearing surgical masks, escorting the 78-year-old former pro boxer out of a Tokyo detention center Thursday. Hunched forward and wearing a yellow, short-sleeved button-down, Hakamada entered a silver van. He was accompanied by his sister, Hideko Hakamada, who earlier attended a rally outside the court in which several dozen supporters broke into emphatic applause when a man unfurled a sign saying, ""Retrial granted."" An emotional Hideko Hakamada told the crowd, ""Thank you very much. I am very pleased. I am very thankful with everyone's support,"" according to the NHK footage. Iwao Hakamada was convicted in 1966 of killing his boss at a soybean processing company, along with the boss's wife and two children, Amnesty said. ""Hakamada 'confessed' after 20 days of interrogation by police. He retracted the confession during the trial and told the court that police had beaten and threatened him,"" Amnesty said. ""According to his lawyers, recent forensic tests show no match between Hakamada's DNA and samples taken from clothing the prosecution alleges was worn by the murderer."" District Court Judge Hiroaki Murayama, who handled the retrial proceeding, said DNA test results indicated blood found on five items of clothing allegedly worn by the culprit was not Hakamada's, according to Kyodo News. Like most death row inmates in Japan, Hakamada was largely held in solitary confinement during his 48 years in prison. His mental health has deteriorated as a result of the decades he spent isolated, Amnesty said. Related story: Life in a box . Hakamada's case marks the sixth time a death row inmate in Japan has earned a retrial, and courts overturned death sentences in four of the five previous cases, NHK reported. Hakamada's case comes just weeks after Louisiana's longest-serving inmate, Glenn Ford, left the State Penitentiary at Angola after almost 30 years in prison. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Iwao Hakamada served 48 years in prison for murders of his boss and boss's family .

"(CNN) -- What if the same number of young people who serve in our armed forces, defending the country, were enlisted to go on offense here at home, fighting persistent but solvable national problems -- the dropout crisis, national parks in need of restoration, and childhood hunger? It's a big idea, one that could make a period of service -- either military or civilian -- a civic rite of passage for America's young people. This week, the Franklin Project, an initiative of the Aspen Institute, released a ""Plan of Action"" to establish a large-scale 21st century system for voluntary national service. Sparked by a stirring speech by Gen. Stanley McChrystal at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year, the plan calls for establishing 1 million full-time service opportunities every year for young adults, ages 18 to 28, putting domestic national service on par with the more than 1 million Americans on active duty in our armed forces. It's a plan that is strongly endorsed not only by nonprofit, philanthropic and private sector leaders, but also people who have dedicated their lives to our national security, including former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, former National Security Advisor Gen. Jim Jones, and McChrystal, who is chairman of the initiative's leadership council. Linking military and civilian service as ""two sides of the same coin"" is perhaps the Franklin Project's most resonant chord. A vibrant nation requires a shared sense of commitment and shared experience of service and sacrifice. But as McCrystal observes, ""Less than 1% of Americans serve in the militaryâ€”a historic low during wartimeâ€”leading to a broad, complacent assumption that serving the nation is someone else's job."" The plan calls for expanding federal programs that are already working, including AmeriCorps, and generating energy behind new ideas. For example, the plan proposes that President Obama ask all federal agencies to examine how they might tap citizens in service to meet their missions. FEMA is already saving $60 million by utilizing national service participants to respond to disasters. We can also expand the opportunities provided by the GI Bill to encourage veterans to continue their service at home -- in schools and community centers -- so the nation can continue to benefit from their dedication to a greater cause. The demand for opportunities to serve has been growing dramatically. In 2011, AmeriCorps received 582,000 applications for only 80,000 positions, and the Peace Corps received 150,000 applications for 4,000 full-time placements. There is an overwhelming desire among the rising millennial generation to give back. Missing are clear pathways and opportunities to serve. As recent polling demonstrates, four in five voters support voluntary national service. The ""Plan of Action"" calls for tapping this wellspring of American idealism to meet pressing national challenges. High on the list is the nation's dropout crisis. Each year, more than a million students fail to graduate with their senior class. Dropouts are eight times more likely to be incarcerated, and three times more likely to be unhealthy or unemployed. Absent effective intervention, the 10 million students who are projected to drop out in the next decade will cost the nation $3 trillion in lost wages, health care expenses, welfare benefits and incarceration costs. The good news is that research has shown that future dropouts can be identified, as early as the sixth grade, by early warning signs such as high absence rate, poor behaviors and getting an ""F"" in math or English. What's needed to close the gap? More people power. ""We've seen the power of having young adults serve in our school through AmeriCorps,"" said Los Angeles Superintendent of Schools John Deasy. ""When a student doesn't show up to school, they get them back in. When they're behind academically, they help catch them up. These young people bring an infectious energy and idealism that makes a huge difference. The only problem is that we don't have enough of them -- we need to scale up national service and tap more young people to give a year of service. It's a resource you can't put a price tag on."" The Franklin Project's ""Plan of Action"" has a powerful response: Calling for 120,000 young people to serve as full-time tutors and mentors in the nation's ""dropout factories:"" the lowest-performing high schools and the elementary and middle schools. It is just one example of how young people, perhaps the nation's greatest untapped resource, can help America succeed. One day, the most commonly asked question of a young adult can and should be, ""Where will you give your year of service?"" The answer to that question is the key to our nation's future success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Brown and Andrew Hauptman.","Michael Brown, Andrew Hauptman: We need a civic rite of passage for young Americans .

"(CNN) -- Four years after the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a British toddler who went missing in Portugal, her parents have written a book detailing their account of that horrible night. ""I suppose there's always been the urge to -- to get the truth out there,"" Kate McCann, the missing girl's mother, told CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview. ""Obviously, when there's been so many stories written. But we've always had things to weigh up. And ultimately, Madeleine's fund was running out, and I knew that we'd need to raise money, really, to continue to search."" She says profits from the book sales will be directed toward furthering the investigation into the disappearance of their daughter in Portugal's Algarve region in 2007. ""There's just always something inside, and the pain is never too far away from the surface,"" said Gerry McCann, the girl's father. News of the missing wide-eyed girl grabbed headlines across the globe and moved celebrities such as soccer star David Beckham to make public pleas for her safe return. ""I don't think it consumes every minute as it did before,"" Kate McCann explained. ""But certainly, you know, Madeleine's absence is there constantly."" She added that she's ""now reached that point where I will allow myself to take time out, and just relax a little, enjoy something."" But the absence of her daughter is ""still tangible."" The pair says they are hopeful that the book, titled ""Madeleine,"" will prompt others to come forward with information about the girl's disappearance. ""There is a chance she may not be alive,"" said Kate McCann. ""But what we do know is there's a very good chance that she is alive."" Madeleine was nearly 4 years old when she vanished from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz as her parents dined in a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Despite a huge police investigation and massive coverage in the Portuguese and British media, she has not been found. At one point, authorities in Portugal had named the girl's parents as suspects, as well as a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese prosecutor's office said in July 2008 that authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and they were no longer considered suspects. Kate McCann said earlier that she thought being named as a suspect had a devastating effect on the case. Portuguese investigators closed the case in July 2008.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Cleanup was under way Sunday on damage to bus stops and outdoor cafes in central Madrid, after austerity protests turned violent Saturday night in the Spanish capital and left 101 people injured. There were 24 arrests. The injured included 67 national and municipal police officers and 34 demonstrators. Eleven were taken to hospitals, including a national police officer who was kicked in the head, lost his riot helmet and lost consciousness, spokesmen for the central and Madrid city governments said. The 24 demonstrators, including three minors, who were arrested face potential charges of assaulting police officers, vandalism, and setting trash bins on fire. Arraignments could begin later Sunday. City street crews and other workers were carrying out the cleanup as authorities evaluated the damage. As has become a pattern at many Spanish protests, the violence came only at the very end of what had been hours of peaceful, noisy and energetic protests. The so-called ""March for Dignity"" was the first major anti-austerity demonstration in Madrid in several months, aimed at telling the government that there is still widespread suffering in Spain despite official pronouncements that the beleaguered economy is recovering. Read more: Madrid, city of protests . Spain's unemployment rate is 26%, with nearly 5.9 million people out of work. Hundreds of protesters in six columns from around Spain have been marching for weeks on the capital to draw attention to the situation. On Saturday, they reached Madrid and were joined by tens of thousands of protesters, who converged along the capital's main boulevard from the Atocha train station to Colon Plaza, where a stage was erected for speakers. It was near the stage, at the end of the march, that the violence erupted after the official close of the demonstration at 8 p.m. local time, even as many protesters were already leaving the area to find transportation home. There have been hundreds of protests in Madrid -- by teachers, doctors and other specific groups -- against the government's austerity measures, aimed at reducing the budget deficit. But the march on Saturday tried to include all of these groups under a broad ""March for Dignity"" banner. Read more: Thousands protest 'anti-protest' law .

"(CNN) -- Last Wednesday, in a move that I still don't fully understand, I became a shareholder in the Spanish football club Real Oviedo. In terms of my relationship with football, I should probably lay my cards on the table. I am a Nottingham Forest fan. Anyone of a certain age with a passing interest in the game will understand that I'm familiar with disappointment. Having watched Forest fall from the heights of back-to-back European Cup wins to the depths of English football's third tier I know, all too well, the emotions involved in witnessing a distressing decline. This doubtless explains why some sense of faded glamour or a struggle against adversity tends to attract me to a club. To illustrate this point, my favorite Italian team is Sampdoria, currently lying 14th in Serie A. Winning, as they say, isn't everything. I realise this is perverse, but I've never been able to understand the appeal of supporting a football giant, going into a season in the confident expectation of wins and trophies. Jerry Maguire . So a couple of weeks ago, when I first heard of the plight of Oviedo, something clicked. I found myself Googling the club, reading about the city of Oviedo, admiring the jagged hills of Asturias. My attention was piqued by Sid Lowe, the British journalist whose animated appreciation of Spanish football has brought La Liga to life for many outside Spain. Lowe ignited the international campaign to save the club, while also warning that investors were highly unlikely to see any return. To paraphrase Jerry Maguire, he had me at 'unlikely'. Here was a potentially lost cause that I was powerless to resist. I stepped up my research and prepared to delve into the insanity of football club ownership. By the time I was ready to take the plunge, Real's global coalition of the willing had swelled considerably and the club was almost half way to safety. The share offer's website looked reassuringly professional, and was helpfully available in English. Estadio Carlos Tartiere . I had initially thought of just buying one share, but then I discovered that owning four shares would entitle me to attend the annual general meeting. Influence, I thought. I imagined myself turning up at the airport, being feted as an arriving hero and bought drinks in Oviedo's tapas bars just for being me. I rejected any thoughts that this scenario was somewhat far-fetched. I inputted my passport number, transferred the cash, sat back and enjoyed the warm glow of owning something of no apparent value whatsoever. The weird thing is that it really was a glow. I had another look at the impressive Estadio Carlos Tartiere and smiled to myself. I wondered how much flights would cost, and how I would persuade my wife that a weekend in Asturias was a good idea. I started following Oviedo types on Twitter. I re-tweeted a link to the club's soon-to-be-opened online shop. Mexican Tycoon . As the club's deadline day of November 17 approached, I kept an eye on the increasingly positive news coming from northern Spain; this people's club, now partly my club, looked close to completing its path to safety. Then came the news of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's intervention. As a push over the line goes it could hardly be more emphatic, and suddenly the need to gather more shareholders became irrelevant. Oviedo was in the clear; 13,000 shareholders and the world's richest man had made it happen. However. I wasn't quite sure how I felt about this new development. The idea that a multi-billionaire was now bankrolling the club was anathema to me; I still feel that the age of the oligarch has done little but damage to football, at least in England. But it also opened up a world of possibilities.  Even Nottingham Forest have super-rich owners now, and at the City Ground the Al Hasawi family have appeared at pains to show the club's fans that they intend to do things ""the right way"". Maybe Carlos Slim would be the same. So far my only proof of ownership is my receipt from Paypal, which almost a week on makes me slightly uneasy but I hope is just a sign of how unbelievably successful this escapade has been for the club. I have a genuine feeling of being part of something, and a sense that this is the start of an exciting story. I also fully intend to make it to a game at the earliest available opportunity. I suppose I should probably think about how I explain to my wife that I've spent a chunk of our weekly shopping money on a Spanish third division football team. She's a Napoli fan; surely she'll understand? For now though I'm waiting patiently for my share certificate to arrive in the post. Whatever happens at the very least I have to buy a Real Oviedo mug.","Why would a Nottingham Forest fan invest $52 in third-tier Spanish club Real Oviedo?

"New York (CNN) -- When a Goldman Sachs employee unexpectedly wrote a scathing op-ed in the New York Times in March 2012 about why he was leaving the investment bank, he painted a picture of a ""toxic"" workplace that embraced morally corrupt practices at the expense of their clients. Edith Cooper's reaction wasn't rooted in damage control. Instead, as the firm's global head of human capital management -- overseeing more than 30,000 employees -- she wanted to know why. ""It was to figure out why it was that there was an individual who worked at Goldman Sachs who felt that the only way they could voice their experience was to write an op-ed in the New York Times,"" she recalls to CNN's Poppy Harlow. ""We've emerged from what was one of the most challenging periods of financial services history, and we've come into a better, more normalized position ... We've been able to take a step back and really think about the future,"" says Cooper. As one of Wall Street's most sought after investment banks, named one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for this year, Cooper has led the human capital management department for the past six years and is responsible for recruiting the best and brightest talent for the firm. ""We continue to be amazed by the extraordinary talents of this generation. They are smart. They get information instantly. And they ask really tough questions. As a result we've got to stay on our toes. Data drives performance . To find the best candidates, she explains, Goldman Sachs uses employee performance metrics. ""Value add is being able to mine all the data that's out there. Think about the people landscape right now ... We develop, we invest, we compensate thousands of people every year. How are we using that data to inform our decisions going forward? ""If you had asked me 30 years ago, 'would I be on the management committee at Goldman Sachs and be the influence of our success through our people?' Oh no way. And so, I think that I've come to expect the unexpected,"" she says. As one of the most powerful people on Wall Street, surprisingly Cooper never planned for a career in finance. As a young woman, her ambition was to own her own clothing boutique in New York City. To make her dream a reality, after graduating from Harvard College Cooper decided she needed to go to business school. She took a job at a Chicago bank while attending business school at the same time at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. Three decades later, she's still in finance and the clothing store is a fond but distant memory. Broadening horizons . Looking back over her career, Cooper credits much of her rise at Goldman Sachs to her time spent working overseas in the firm's London office. ""I think in today's economy, operating outside of your comfort zone is really, really important. I can't think of any industry where it's not important to be able to take that risk of stepping forward into the unfamiliar."" She describes moving abroad as an ""extraordinary experience"" where she reveled in learning how to work with people from all over the world. With some 30,000 employees around the globe, the management skills she honed in London continue to help Cooper in her role today. ""I'm responsible for them -- the good, the bad and the not so perfect,"" says Cooper. ""[I] need to make sure that we are continuing to be viewed as a terrific place to work."" Cooper is also one of four women on Goldman Sachs' 29-member executive committee. It's a number she says needs to rise and notes diversity in all areas -- not just gender -- is key to success. ""There are four women, but I also see that there's other types of diversity as well and we need more of everything."" We can't be the great firm that we need to be, to be relevant to our clients, if we don't have diversity at every level."" Corporate confidants . As she has risen up the ranks, Cooper is well aware of the help she has received from peers along the way. She recalls when she joined the management committee and was pulled aside after the first Monday morning meeting by the bank's president and COO Gary Cohn. ""He said, 'You know what? You did not represent what you do and what you know at the management committee this morning. Going forward, every Sunday ... we have a call -- you're going to go through with me what you're going to talk about."" Had she failed? Had Goldman Sachs made the wrong decision in promoting her? These questions raced through Cooper's mind. But in retrospect she says it was the guidance she needed. In the end, she had only two calls with Cohn. It was all she needed. ""It meant that I wasn't alone in the experience. ""A lot of times, mentoring is listening and feeding back to people that they can actually figure it out but they just need the confidence boost to do that,"" she explains. ""I'm successful because other people have gotten behind me. It's my passion to be there for other people as well.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown is reaching into Lindsay Lohan's playbook for avoiding jail: Go to rehab before your court date. The singer's arrest Sunday on an assault charge put him on a path toward a possible prison sentence, but he will be in a rehabilitation facility as his next court date approaches. ""Chris Brown has elected to enter a rehab facility,"" said a statement Tuesday night from his representative. ""His goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior, enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point."" There has been no indication that Brown, 24, has a substance abuse problem. The behavior that has landed him in legal trouble over the past several years has been anger management. Brown's brutal attack on former girlfriend Rihanna on the eve of the Grammys in February 2009 resulted in a felony domestic violence conviction that carried a lengthy probation period. A judge found him in violation of that probation in August because of discrepancies in proving he fulfilled the court-ordered 1,400 hours of community labor. He imposed another 1,000 hours of work. The Los Angeles County district attorney appears in no mood to cut Brown any breaks, which suggests that prosecutors will ask for jail time for him because of the arrest early Sunday in the shadow of the White House. While the simple assault charge in Washington is a misdemeanor, it could trigger a probation revocation. Brown is in a vulnerable position. The Los Angeles judge overseeing his felony probation could order him to complete as many as four years in prison for the beating of Rihanna if he is found in violation of probation. Brown is due in a Los Angeles court on November 20 for a probation status hearing. Prosecutors have declined to comment on if they will seek to put him behind bars. The U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia charged Brown and his bodyguard with simple assault for a brawl over the weekend in which a 20-year-old Maryland man suffered a broken nose. Brown spent 36 hours in a Washington jail and was taken to court in shackles Monday afternoon. He was released and ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours. The probation officer's job is to prepare a report for the Los Angeles judge who will decide if Brown will be found in violation of his probation. Going to rehab -- as his rep said ""to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior"" -- could allow Brown lawyer Mark Geragos to argue that the entertainer is getting proper help for his core problem. The statement from Brown's rep did not disclose where the singer is going for rehab, how long he intends to stay, or what might be a ""healthier vantage point"" for him. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","The announcement comes after he was arrested in Washington on simple assault charge .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has stirred up controversy ahead of a rare visit to Britain which begins Monday, accusing British authorities of ignoring intelligence that could have prevented the 2005 London bombings . King Abdullah accused Britain of not doing enough to fight international terrorism. In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation that aired on Monday, the Saudi king said Britain failed to act on information provided by Saudi security services ahead of the suicide bombings on London's transport network in July 2005, that killed 52 people and injured more than 770. ""We sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist atrocities in Britain, but unfortunately no action was taken and it may have been able to avert the tragedy,"" the monarch told the BBC. King Abdullah's arrival in London on Monday will mark the first state visit by a Saudi monarch in 20 years. In the BBC interview, he refused to elaborate on the details of the intelligence, saying that disclosing specific information ""may cause sensitivities"" between the two countries' security services. However, he went on to say that Britain was among a number of countries that were not taking the issue of global terrorism seriously. A British Home Office spokesman strenuously denied that any intelligence from Saudi Arabia had been overlooked in the run-up to the atrocities and that information provided by the Saudis ""was materially different from what actually occurred on 7 July and clearly not relevant to those acts."" ""We have made it clear that if we had intelligence that could have prevented the attacks we would have acted upon it,"" the spokesman told CNN. The spokesman said an investigation by the British Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) published last year found there was no evidence that intelligence passed on by the Saudis could have prevented the bombings. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi Arabian counterpart in London Monday, but the Foreign Office insisted it was for personal reasons and not a snub. Miliband has just adopted a baby son and is taking time off to look after him, the British Foreign Office confirmed to CNN. The Foreign Office insisted Miliband's decision to pull out of the meeting with Saudi's Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal was due to personal reasons and was in no way linked to King Abdullah's comments. Miliband's duties are being carried out by junior ministers in his absence. E-mail to a friend .","Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah begins state visit to Britain on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams is through to her ninth Miami Masters final after beating Maria Sharapova at Crandon Park on Thursday. Defending champion Williams trailed early on in the match before powering her way past her Russian opponent in straight sets 6-4 6-3. Sharapova had worked an early lead, breaking in the fourth game of the opening set and led 4-1 at one stage. But her advantage was short-lived as Williams reeled off five games in a row to close out the set. The fourth seed broke Williams again in the second game of the second set to steal an early advantage, but any momentum gained was immediately lost as the world No. 1 broke back in the very next game. Further breaks in the seventh and finally the ninth game sealed Sharapova's fate, dashing hopes that she could break her duck in a tournament where she has finished runner-up on five occasions. ""It wasn't easy,"" Williams said afterwards. ""Obviously Maria plays really well, and she's done really well here, so I just decided I had to do a little better, stay focused and make more shots."" This latest defeat is the Russian's 15th in a row against the American -- a sequence which stretches all the way back to 2004. Williams will play Li Na in Saturday's final after China's world No. 2 beat Dominika Cibulkova in a rematch of January's Australian Open title match. It went to three sets, as did their quarterfinal clash at Indian Wells this month, before Li prevailed 7-5 2-6 6-3 against the Slovakian 10th seed to become the first player from her country to reach the Miami final. The 32-year-old is seeking to end a run of nine consecutive defeats against Williams, the last of which was in the final of last season's WTA Championships. ""It's a good challenge, I think,"" she said. ""Here we can really see how I've improved in these three, four months."" World No. 1 Rafael Nadal fought his way into the men's semifinals, where he will face 2010 runner-up Tomas Berdych. The Spaniard needed to come from behind against big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, winning 4-6 6-2 6-4 in two hours and 35 minutes. ""For me to be in semifinals after losing early in Indian Wells is very important for my confidence,"" said Nadal, a three-time losing finalist in the hard-court tournament. Nadal has a 16-match winning streak against Berdych, who will return to the top five in the rankings after earlier battling past Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-4 7-6 (7/3) in the third quarterfinal. It was the Czech's 450th ATP Tour victory, making him just the ninth active player to achieve that milestone. ""He was a very tricky opponent,"" said Berdych.

"(CNN) -- When Bill Gates testified via videotape in Microsoft's antitrust trial in 1998, he was combative and defensive, as if he couldn't believe how stupid the entire procedure was. He didn't expect the tape to be shown in court. It was, and it was a disaster. Public opinion turned -- instead of a billionaire genius who had built Microsoft into the most valuable tech company in the world, he was a condescending monopolist who didn't have time for the legal system. Amazingly, Gates didn't see it coming. As Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen relates in his recent autobiography, the anti-Microsoft sentiment ""cut Bill to the core."" Gates told the media that government attorney David Boies was ""really out to destroy Microsoft."" In his rational engineer's mind, Microsoft was simply a winner. It had beaten its competitors by being smarter and working harder. It seemed deeply unfair for the government to build a case based on the complaints of those competitors and undo everything that Gates had worked so hard for. Flash forward a decade. Google is the new Microsoft. It dominates its industry so completely that a few slight tweaks to its search engine can throw other companies into turmoil by burying them in search results. It's using the incredible cash generated by that business to expand in a million different directions at once, from online video to social networking to mobile phones. The man running Google, co-founder Larry Page, has a lot in common with Gates. Like Gates, Page is often described in otherworldly terms, a near-genius with autistic tendencies like counting the seconds out loud while you're explaining something too slowly to him. Like Gates, he has run his own company for his entire adult life and has had uninterrupted success. Like Gates, he has an engineer's soul and is obsessive about cutting waste -- one of his first acts after taking over as CEO in April was to send an all-hands e-mail describing how to run meetings more efficiently. Like Gates, he is hugely ambitious -- he once suggested that Google hire a million engineers and told early investors that he saw Google as a $100 billion company. That's $100 billion in annual revenue, not just stock value. (It's about one-third of the way there.) And like Gates, Page may have a blind spot about the intersection of business and the Beltway. For instance, when Google paid $3.2 billion to buy display ad firm DoubleClick in 2007, it got a search-engine marketing firm called Performics as part of the deal. Obviously, Google would have to let Performics go -- federal regulators would never let the dominant search company own a search marketing company. Except Page wanted to keep it, just to see how it worked. (Google sold Performics to advertising conglomerate Publicis Groupe in 2008.) Back then, Page had a tempering force in Eric Schmidt, who was the company's CEO and was originally brought in by its investors to provide ""adult supervision."" But since Page reclaimed the CEO title, the brakes are off. In his first five months, Page has reorganized the company to his liking, cut a bunch of marginal projects like Google Health and mobile app maker Slide, launched a social network to compete with Facebook and bid $12.5 billion to buy Motorola's mobile phone business. Now, antitrust investigators are circling Google -- just like they did with Microsoft. Europe has already launched a formal investigation, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a close look as well. As Google keeps expanding with big, bold moves, Page will find himself thrust into the spotlight like he's never been before. For Google's sake, here's hoping he handles it with more grace than Gates. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Rosoff.

"(CNN) -- Talk of Iran's nuclear program took center stage Thursday in discussions between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The inescapable topic of peace between Israel and its Palestinian rivals was also on the agenda. Netanyahu has accused international powers that reached a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program of making a ""historic mistake"" that could put Israel in grave danger. The agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country's uranium enrichment program, which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes. In public remarks after his private meeting with Netanyahu, Kerry said the United States remains committed to Israel's security. ""I can't emphasize enough that Israel's security in this negotiation is at the top of our agenda,"" Kerry said, according to pool reports. ""And the United States will do everything in our power to make certain that Iran's nuclear program -- a program of weaponization possibilities -- is terminated. Negotiator in chief: How John Kerry delivered the Iran deal . ""We agree on what the goal of the final status agreement ought to be,"" Kerry said. ""And in the days and weeks ahead, we will consult very closely and continually with our Israeli friends in order to bring about a comprehensive agreement that can withstand everybody's test."" Kerry also made another push for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks Thursday as he hopped between Jerusalem and Ramallah to address grievances from both sides. He kicked off talks in July, but in November, both sides dug in to their decades-old trenches and passed around blame. ""We have always known that this is a difficult, complicated road, and we understand that,"" Kerry said in remarks with Netanyahu. ""I believe we are making some progress, and the parties remain committed to this task. They are meeting regularly, and they have also remained -- we have remained in very close touch with both leaders as we proceed down this road."" He also addressed peace after meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. ""Today, we discussed at great length issues of security in the region, security for the state of Israel, security for a future Palestine,"" Kerry said. ""And we, I think, made some progress in discussing some of the ideas that are on the table. We are not going to discuss these further publicly, but I will say that the goal here for everybody is a viable Palestinian state with the Palestinian people living side by side in peace with the state of Israel and with the people of Israel."" Earlier, Netanyahu said that Israel is ""ready for a historic peace"" based on a two-state solution but that Israel's security needs must be respected, and finger-pointing that he said helped derail the earlier talks must end. ""What we need is not grandstanding but understanding,"" he said. Israeli, Palestinian accusations . In November, Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of continuing to incite distrust of Israel and perpetuating an ""artificial crisis"" to avoid a real peace deal. Palestinians shot back that it is Jerusalem that has been sowing distrust, but the hottest issue remains the construction of thousands of Jewish settlement units on the West Bank and other land that Palestinians claim as theirs. It is the real source of the ""deep crisis between the Palestinians and the Israeli negotiations team,"" a Palestinian official said. He accused Israel of falsely claiming that the Palestinians were willing to let construction go forward if Israel released more Palestinians from prisons. It's a concession that Israel commonly makes in deals with the Palestinian leadership. It's simply not true, the official said. ""All settlements are illegal in the West Bank and Jerusalem."" Motivating players . Kerry has been toting along a gift bag to motivate the players. Palestinians are receiving economic stimulus from Washington, which is shelling out a $100 million contribution to a program to build new roads, water lines, schools and other infrastructure. The measure, called the High Impact Micro-Infrastructure Initiative, is also expected to create jobs for the unemployed in the impoverished territory. The United States has also tasked U.S. Gen. John Allen to work up an assessment of Israel's security needs in the event of a comprehensive peace agreement, Kerry said. It's a must if Israel is going to sign on, Netanyahu said. ""Israel must be able to defend itself by itself.""","NEW: Effort to restart peace talks ""made some progress,"" John Kerry says .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the fastest growing cities in the world situated in one of the most rapidly developing nations. Every year, roughly 200,000 newcomers arrive in the Indian capital of New Delhi. Some head to the city's sprawling informal slums while others land in more upmarket residential areas. This vast influx of people has contributed to a chaotic urban scene, a burgeoning population of almost 13 million people and a boom at the higher end of the city's housing market. Around 50 years ago, residents in neighborhoods like Lutyens in south Delhi's leafy inner suburbs paid rents of just $5 per month. Today, this same area hosts properties that market for $100 million each. Nearby districts such as Lajpat Nagar (where a two-bedroom house sells for $300,000) and Nizamuddin (where a similar property can go for $950,000) have witnessed a similar surge in prices. See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury properties? With so little space available, demand so high and restrictions that limit the height of new housing units, developers have been forced to get creative when constructing new properties. Some have been forced to make the most of tight locations. ""We took six to eight months to complete this project,"" explained Namrata Malkani, a developer whose family bought a small plot of land and developed a compact yet modern four-story apartment block between two old, crumbling houses. ""We have partly sold it,"" already she proudly adds. Read more: Can micro-home offer housing solution? Improvements in the surrounding area and investments in local services meanwhile have helped make the neighborhood a more desirable place to stay, Malkani revealed. ""Because of the drainage it was (previously) difficult to stay here because it was smelly,"" Malkani said. ""But the government has invested a lot into bringing up gardens and covering these drainages, which is why the property prices here have increased now."" See also: A new star on the rise in Mumbai's property market . And they have increased considerably. Homes such as Malkani's sell for roughly $4,000 per square meter ($371 per square foot). With a total area of 75 sq m (807 sq ft) this means the asking price for Malkani's two bedroom house comes in at $300,000. Yet according to local estate agent, Rahul Rewal, these high prices still equates to a smart investment. ""I don't see value in terms of size here,"" Rewal said. ""But why people buy here is they see a potential for appreciation and a stable return because the demand in the city is ever increasing,"" he added. For the 2.3 million people (17% of the city's population) residing in New Delhi's close by slum neighborhoods such ostentatious concerns remains a far cry from reality. Those with the means, such as Rewal and Malkani, however, expect to see more growth in their respective investments as the New Delhi population increases further.

"(CNN) -- Days after Chris Brown took to his Twitter page accusing stores of ""blackballing"" his new album, ""Graffiti,"" the singer's account was deleted after he left a final message to his fans. ""I WANNA THANK MY FANS FOR ALL THE SUPPORT,"" said Brown's final tweet, posted Monday afternoon. ""I LOVE YALL. GOODBYE!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Over the weekend, Brown went on a tirade after he visited a Wal-Mart store in Connecticut and didn't see his album on shelves. ""The didnt even have my album in the back ... not on shelves, saw for myself,"" he tweeted. Brown said he spoke to the manager, who had no answers. ""the manager told me that when there are new releases its mandatory to put em on the shelves. BUT NO SIGN OF #GRAFFITI. BS,"" he tweeted. He continued to say that Alicia Keys' new album was stocked and ready for release, though it wasn't due out until Tuesday. Fans began instantly replying with unverified stories about their attempts to buy Brown's CD. The singer began retweeting, or forwarding the tweets out, some of which claimed when fans asked when the shelves would be restocked they were told ""never,"" and allegations that managers said they didn't support ""woman-beaters."" News of his outrage spread quickly and many media outlets began reporting on his complaints. Brown began using Twitter as a way to connect to his fans after he pleaded guilty and was sentenced for beating his then-girlfriend Rihanna. Whether it was an attempt to garner favorable public relations in the wake of an image-shattering event or just a late adaptation to the microblogging craze, Brown had spent the months after the incident using his Twitter account to reach and connect with 172,366 followers. He tweeted regularly thanking his fans for their continued support and sounding off after concerts. It was unclear what specifically sparked Brown to delete his account, named ""mechanicaldummy,"" He had started the day with a normal ""good morning"" message to his fans.","Brown: ""I WANNA THANK MY FANS FOR ALL THE SUPPORT.

"(CNN) -- Lingering oil residue at the bottom of Gulf Coast marshes caused heart defects and hindered reproduction in a small fish seen as an environmental bellwether, researchers said Thursday. The Gulf killifish spends its whole life in the marshes of the Gulf Coast, with few in their lifetimes venturing more than a football field's length from where they were born. Because of that, they've been the subject of several studies since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill erupted off Louisiana in April 2010. The latest, conducted by scientists from Louisiana State University and University of California-Davis, found killifish embryos that were exposed to oiled sediments hatched at a rate 40% lower than those cultivated in samples from un-oiled sites. Those that did hatch were smaller, had lower heart rates and had cardiovascular deformities that were likely to hurt their chances of survival, said Ben Dubansky, an environmental toxicologist at Louisiana State University. ""Early life exposure affects heart function, and these abnormalities persist until adulthood and make it harder for fish to survive, evade predators and eat,"" Dubansky said. The findings were published online this week in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Science and Technology. Co-author Andrew Whitehead said the killifish is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for the Gulf Coast, where scientists are still trying to catalog the effects of the 2012 disaster. ""They're the most abundant fish in these marshes,"" said Whitehead, a genome biologist at UC-Davis. ""They're a really important forage species -- that means a lot of the fish that we care about commercially eat them. They're really important as that sort of middleman member of the community ... Their biology is going to reflect the quality of their local environment."" Because the oil spread across the Gulf in patches, Whitehead said it's still too early to tell what the findings mean for killifish populations overall. The study this week isn't a direct sign that the numbers are shrinking, but it's a warning, he said. ""Any animals that share a similar habitat to our killifish are going to be at similar risk to this species, and there are lots of commercial species that we care about that share the same habitat,"" he said. In earlier studies, scientists observed deformities in the gills of killifish. In this study, Whitehead said, ""We brought the field into the lab"" by collecting water and sediment samples from areas that had gotten hit by oil during the spill, introducing embryonic killifish and comparing the results to fish cultivated in samples from un-oiled sites. ""What we found were pretty clear and dramatic and pretty obvious development differences in the embryos exposed to the oiled sediments,"" he said. Killifish are typically a few inches long and commonly used as bait. There's no sign that the oil components are accumulating in their meat, but the fish are suffering ""massive biological effects"" as their systems process the compounds, said LSU environmental toxicologist Fernando Galvez, another collaborator on the study. Researchers are still trying to assess the damage the spill did to the Gulf Coast, but fishermen in some parts of Louisiana say the catch has yet to recover from the spill. Oil company BP, which owned the ruptured well and is responsible for the cleanup, announced plans for nearly $600 million in restoration projects in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana this week. The new research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, the BP-funded effort to study the environmental impact of the Gulf spill. BP said in a statement Friday that while the company had not had a chance to review the data in the new study, ""it is important to note that there are many sources of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or compounds in the oil that settled into the sediments) and other stressors that elicit the biological effects described in the killifish paper. These sources have existed for years in Louisiana marshes, and not all are associated with oil."" BP says the spill has cost it more than $32 billion to date, including cleanup costs, compensation and penalties. It's currently in a federal court in New Orleans, seeking to avoid a finding of gross negligence that could result in another $17-plus billion in fines under the Clean Water Act.","Study links oil exposure to heart defects in Gulf killifish .

"(CNN) -- It is akin to Sebastian Vettel designing his own Formula One car, getting in the cockpit and driving it to the world title. In F1, it would be a mission impossible; in the winter sport of skeleton racing it is, at the very least, a monstrous mission improbable which Briton Kristan Bromley has made an infinite reality from the unlikeliest of beginnings. It has earned him the nickname Doctor Ice and brought him world, European and British titles. The one medal missing from the trophy cabinet is an Olympic one, achieved by his fiancee and mother of the couple's daughter, Ella, Shelley Rudman, who won silver seven years ago in Turin on one of the sleds he designed. There is a somewhat laughable nature to how he found a new career path in such cutting-edge design while based at BAE Systems and tasked with working on the Eurofighter Typhoon, which made its combat debut in Libya in 2011 with the Royal Air Force and Italian Air Force. ""I got a memo sent round internally inviting me to a talk about Bob Skeleton,"" he recalls. ""I'd never heard of the sport so I asked one of the guys, 'who is Bob Skeleton?' -- I thought it was a guy to start with. ""You can imagine my surprise that it turned out to be a sport that changed my life completely."" It is a leap of faith to go from the Eurofighter, which cost an approximate Â£200m each, to design what is effectively a steel tray designed to ensure an athlete is propelled at speeds of up to 130km/h down a sheet ice bobsled run -- head first. ""I just got hooked on the sport,"" he admits. ""I'd finished at university and was back at British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) and we were approached by the British skeleton team to help with their performance. ""At the time, they were at the back of the field using second-hand equipment from whoever they could. ""I was one of the British graduates starting and, three months later, I was the only one working on it, and I got Nottingham University to sponsor it."" Sink or swim . It spawned his PhD on ""factors affecting the performance of skeleton bobsleds"" but it was never with a view to competing himself, which came about by force rather than forethought on his part. ""I first went to Altenberg in Germany with something put together with a few nuts and bolts and none of the British team would ride it,"" he recalls. ""There was this rule, you had to prove it first. So it was a simple decision that I could either sink or swim."" He swam or at least crashed, got on again, got hooked and could not stop. Two years later, he was competing properly and after just a year of competition he was British No.1. Fittingly, he won his first major crown -- the European Championships -- at the same Altenberg venue in 2004 before winning the world title four years later at the same venue, one that has in many ways defined him. If he was a designer first and a competitor second, the two now run in parallel. For the early years of his career, he used BAE as his base to create the skeleton before launching Bromley Technologies with his brother Richard in 2000. Working together, Bromley the competitor designs the sleds, brother Richard manufactures them. For Bromley, the older of the two siblings, his engineering began -- with an admittedly Winter Olympic slant -- when he nailed a pair of his Wellington boots to two planks of wood to create his own DIY skis in his father's workshop as a five-year-old. ""I always liked making things but particularly making things go fast, so this was an inevitable end in some ways."" The process has become increasingly technical in the intervening years but he still insists the approach can be simplistic at its core. ""You break it down as having to go from point A to point B, and you have a certain amount of energy,"" he explains, ""some of which gets lost along the way. My work is to make sure it is more efficient and goes faster. I design it, and I'm the test pilot too."" Drawing board . Despite his engineering background he had no experience in computer-aided design nor computational fluid dynamics, a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods to solve and analyze issues concerning fluid flows, but, with the help of sponsors, he sat himself down and taught himself. ""I've always been of the view that yes there are hurdles but there are ways around them,"" he adds, ""and it's a never-ending task because you can always go faster. The key is understanding, if you understand the problems, you can go faster."" Bromley explains that he has virtually gone back to the drawing board to create a sled capable of winning him that, as yet, elusive Olympic title in the last two years. What that is exactly, he is loathe to go into detail at the risk of alerting his rivals to what he sees could be a potential advantage but he also argues it is not just about the sled. ""I want to give myself and Shelley the best possible chance but the sled doesn't win, the athlete does,"" he says, looking forward to the Winter Olympics in Sochi early next year. ""For example, at BAE I had the most cutting-edge materials. I based the sled on the air duct of the Eurofighter using carbon fibre, but it didn't necessarily make the sled go faster."" The current sled has a steel chassis for its base, able to deal with the top speeds that will be hit in Sochi, the four or five Gs going through it, with Bromley on board akin to half a tonne at full pelt on the ice. ""But again it's all about understanding,"" he says. ""If you understand something, it's easy to change it. ""We're always trying to understand the dynamics of the sled and the aerodynamics of the athlete. We also need to personalise the aero as what works for me won't necessarily work for Shelley."" High-octane world . For Bromley, there are three key areas to his design approach: the aerodynamics, the runners on the ice with its control and handling, and the influence of the sled with its feel on the ice. To focus on that aero work in particular, he has sought the help of all and sundry, including the use of the wind tunnels of two F1 teams. Much like F1, mastering the tweaks and additions that work and don't work can prove to be a very fine art. ""I'd say that 19 out of 20 times, you do stuff that doesn't work,"" he admits. ""You have theories, isolate one thing but then it has an impact on everything else. ""It can work in some ways and have a negative effect in others. But you do get that Eureka moment when it clicks. I think I've had that about seven times in my career and that's certainly helped me to win major championships."" As for Bromley the athlete, he is, by his own admission, an adrenalin junkie, his earlier love for motocross replaced by the similarly high-octane world of skeleton racing. In the past, he used to be an aggressive competitor in terms of his approach to a course, now he is more technical, more free-flowing, enabling him to let the sled do more of the work. So how will he do at Sochi and will the course suit him? ""I hope so but a bit like an F1 driver, everyone has a favourite course and mine's always been Lillehammer, it's where I still hold the course record."" At 41, he is an older competitor although athletes have tended to win medals in the event in their late thirties and early forties. He still believes he is at his peak and for the first time in five seasons approaches the season start without an injury setback. His training is akin to that of a sprinter, explosive work in the gym, on the track and on the ice, although because of the nature of the sport, his sprinting is limited to 30-metre bursts at the very maximum. 'Doctor Ice' With age, the only major change has been allowing more recovery time and understanding his ageing limbs better. The Olympics will be his last ever outing as a competitor, his focus after that solely on his future business and the aim is to get through this last season in one piece. To date, the worst injury he has sustained crashing is a broken hand but the death of Nodar Kumaritashvili in the men's luge at the same course as the skeleton at the last Winter Olympics highlights the inherent dangers of the sport. ""There are risks at that speeds but the courses are designed for the sled to take the hit,"" said Bromley. ""It's about 30 or 40kg so you make sure it's in front of you, then you just slide on. There's ice burns but that's usually the worst of it. But such is the design, you won't hit the ice head on, usually on the side."" ""Doctor Ice,"" so named by an English newspaper after he travelled back from Salt Lake City with a bobsled full of 20 gallons of water to freeze and better understand as part of his PhD, will use brain and body will do their utmost to sort out the one caveat from his career CV. ""Anything can happen once you're at the Games but a medal's realistic,"" he says. Science and skill will hold the key in what, come next year, will have been two decades dedicated to the discipline.","Kristan Bromley targets Olympic glory in final ever competition in Sochi in 2014 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A passenger sitting at the rear of the US Airways flight forced to land in the Hudson River testified Tuesday he climbed over about a dozen rows of seats as he tried to escape through the front of the floating plane. Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger testifies in Washington about landing in New York's Hudson River. Billy Campbell is the only passenger scheduled to testify before an aviation safety panel chaired by Robert Sumwalt, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. Tuesday was the first of three days of hearings, which will try to determine the probable cause of the January 15 accident, he said. A final determination will be made by the entire NTSB board. ""I am committed to an impartial and complete investigation of this accident,"" Sumwalt said at the opening. Also on the board are two deputy directors: John DeLisi from the Office of Aviation Safety and Joseph Kolly from the Office of Research and Engineering. The plane's pilot, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, was forced to land the Airbus A320 after both of its engines failed. Officials almost immediately blamed it on birds, probably Canada geese, being sucked into the engines. Monday, Smithsonian Institution scientists said analysis of feathers found in the engines showed that at least three Canada geese were involved. All 155 people aboard were safely evacuated after the plane skidded to a stop in the river. Sullenberger, the hearing's first witness, recommended that training in water landings be mandatory for all pilots.  Watch Sullenberger describe the river landing » . Campbell, who was in seat 25A, a window seat, was asked to detail what happened before and after landing. He testified he heard a loud explosion about three minutes after takeoff. The plane ""shuddered,"" there was a smell of jet fuel, and the left engine was on fire, he said. One passenger tried to get something from an overhead bin but was ordered to sit down by a flight attendant. He hoped the plane would make it to an airport, but it became evident they were descending over the river.  Watch as gripping plane audio is played during the hearing » . ""Captain Sullenberger comes on and says brace for impact,"" Campbell said. ""I knew we were going to crash into the river, because I was near the window."" Campbell said that once the plane hit the river, water streamed in from his and other windows, and water from elsewhere began filling the aisle. He said he was unable to dislodge the life vest from under the seat. Flight attendant Doreen Welsh told passengers in the back that they could not go out the back door and ordered them to ""turn around and go to the front."" Campbell said he didn't know why the door wouldn't open. Once the plane struck the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, ""I think our biggest fear was how long would the plane stay afloat,"" Campbell said. When they landed, the pilot lifted the nose of the plane, and water poured into the aisles. ""I did see the plane submerge; we were under water,"" Campbell said. ""Then the plane bounced back but started to lift to the right."" He said he didn't know the left engine was sheared off. He feared they would tip over. After being told he couldn't go out the back door, he began climbing over seats to reach the front. At one point, he helped a woman and child who were trying to flee. He, Sullenberger and the co-pilot got on a rubber raft, but it was tethered to the plane. A crew member from a rescue ferry threw them a knife so they could cut the cord, Campbell said. Campbell was asked whether he had read the safety card in the seat pocket in front of him, and he said he hadn't, because he flies so much. He said that when the pilot told everyone to ""brace for impact,"" he knew what that meant because he'd seen the order in movies. ""I think a lot of us are unclear about the definition of that term,"" he said. A technical panel providing expertise to the board includes Robert Benzon, hearing officer and investigator-in-charge of the crash. Also in the audience were representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Line Pilots Association, the Association of Flight Attendants, US Airways, Airbus and CFM International. All were allowed to question the witnesses.","Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was forced to land a plane in the Hudson River .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Just two weeks after his wedding, Christophe Quancard was diagnosed with glioblastoma, one of the deadliest types of brain tumors. He was only 35 years old. The news was devastating. ""In our age group, no one is ready for the diagnosis, (or) the possibility,"" Quancard said. ""I mean, we know it's out there, but you didn't think it would happen when you were still young and had so many other things that you were thinking about."" Quancard's team of doctors encouraged him to get in touch with a group called Imerman Angels. The nonprofit matches cancer patients with cancer survivors so they can receive support from someone who has been down a similar path. Within a few days, Quancard was talking to Greg Cantwell, a 38-year-old survivor of late-stage brain cancer. Cantwell was diagnosed eight years ago, when his son was 1, and had hoped to live until his son was at least 5. The boy is now 9. Cantwell is living proof that cancer is not a death sentence. And his experience has given Quancard much-needed help -- and hope -- during a difficult time. ""You don't know what's really going to hit you emotionally or what kind of therapies you may not have thought of, how to get help, how to make the best use of the resources you have,"" said Quancard, 36. ""You really need someone who's been through this to help you. ... Somehow it makes it so much easier, even in the very hard parts that are coming."" Quancard is just one of thousands of cancer patients who've found one-on-one support through Imerman Angels. ""We (want) to make sure that people that are diagnosed with cancer are able to reach a survivor who can look them in the eye and say: 'I've been there. I beat it. And so will you,' "" said Jonny Imerman, a cancer survivor who started the group in 2002. Imerman was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2001, when he was just 26 years old. He went through a rigorous chemotherapy treatment that sometimes would last eight hours a day. One year later, doctors found more cancer, and Imerman underwent a procedure to remove four tumors from his spine. Now 37, he says he was fortunate to have the constant support of family and friends as he battled the disease. ""They kept me going,"" he said. ""With so much support, I did not have a chance to lose hope."" But other cancer patients between the ages of 15 and 39 are not always as fortunate. The National Cancer Institute recently reported that progress in treating adolescents and young adults has stagnated. Seven out of 10 patients in the age group go on to live at least five more years, but that statistic hasn't improved in 30 years. ""Young adults are kind of a lost group of oncology patients,"" said Dr. Peter Shaw, director of the Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Program at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""They are in a gray area between pediatric and adult care. Unfortunately, they don't always find their way to timely, optimal medical care."" There are several reasons why, Shaw said. ""They historically have been the least-insured age group in the U.S., most physicians are less suspicious of cancer in healthy young adults, and many of these patients -- once diagnosed -- may still feel invincible and be in denial, leading to less compliance with their treatments,"" he said. During Imerman's five-month treatment in 2001, he would walk the hospital halls in Detroit and see young cancer patients who were alone and struggling. ""Everyone is like a caged animal in these rooms. They were lying in bed, motionless, watching television or staring in space. ... You could see the fear in their faces,"" Imerman said. ""And I felt guilty as I walked down the hallways and looked in these rooms. And finally ... I just walked in with my I.V. pole one day. ... ""(I said:) 'What kind of cancer do you have? And what kind of chemo do you have?' ... These people were like open arms. They were so excited to have a visitor to talk to them."" Imerman began engaging other patients and offering support and camaraderie. ""It was instant friendship,"" he said. ""You're not talking surface level. You're talking about life and death. My goal was to get in there and motivate patients so that they wanted to jump out of their chemo bed and literally start swinging at this thing."" Do you know a hero? Nominations for 2012 Heroes close August 31 . When Imerman was deemed cancer-free, his health improved and his spirits soared along with his dreams to offer hope to more cancer patients. Imerman started reaching out to doctors and hospitals and was referred to other cancer survivors. He collected data, spread the word and became a matchmaker of sorts. Today, nearly a decade later, Imerman Angels has a database of more than 4,000 survivor mentors. The group carefully pairs a cancer fighter with a mentor who had the same type of cancer. And caregivers, such as a spouse, parent, child or friend, can also be paired with other caregivers and survivors. The group tries to connect people who live in the same city and can meet in person. But its database also extends overseas, and some pairs communicate via phone and Skype. On average, the group creates five to seven pairs a day. Imerman Angels has made more than 8,000 matches in more than 65 countries. ""(Our) cancer survivors have amazing stories and volunteer to give their story back, to help somebody else out with the same cancer,"" Imerman said. ""We share stories. We listen. We learn. We become close and connected, because we expose probably the most vulnerable time of our lives. ... ""I think the bigger picture -- and what we need to do in a cancer world -- is create more friendships."" Survivors who have navigated the often-complex cancer system can share what they know with patients who are starting at square one and are often unsure where to turn. ""There's a great benefit for an individual to be able to contact somebody else who's struggled with the same problem,"" said Dr. Steven T. Rosen, director of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. ""To be able to get the perspective of another patient who can tell them about what to anticipate and also to see someone who's been through the process, who's had a good outcome and that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. In many instances ... it improves their quality of life dramatically."" Imerman Angels runs on donations, and the majority of its small staff are cancer survivors. Although the group accepts men and women of any age, more than half of its roster is between 18 and 40. ""Imerman Angels is incredible in the sense that they're able to pair you up with someone that looks just like you and that gets it and that can tell you it's going to be OK,"" said Jenna Benn, who was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma when she was 29. ""All of a sudden, your reality doesn't seem so strange. It seems sort of normal. As much as I didn't want to be a part of this club and I didn't ask to be here, I'm really happy that I have this community that Jonny has built."" Imerman continues to make his rounds at the oncology wings of Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, just like he did in Detroit more than a decade ago. ""I'm a survivor. You're going to be, too,"" he regularly tells patients. For Imerman, mentoring patients has helped him to live in the moment and embrace life without fearing a recurrence of cancer. ""I don't really count the days since cancer, because it's like every day's a birthday,"" he said. ""Every day is a good day. You're happy you woke up. ... Life is amazing."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Bohuslän might not trip off the tongue, but with its 8,000 islands, many wild and uninhabited, the Swedish coastal strip is a paradise for kayakers -- or for anyone seeking high-grade solitude. The Swedes come in droves (around half a million last year) and international visitors are on the rise -- more than 200,000 foreigners annually so far, many from neighboring Norway and the UK. They're on to a good thing -- with its clean water and air, more pretty fishing villages than you could stuff in a postcard rack and countless wriggling nets-worth of seafood, this is a pristine piece of Europe. Stretching from Gothenburg in the south to the border with Norway, it's large enough that you can easily get away, paddling or otherwise, from crowds -- even in summer. You'd be missing out to head to the Bohuslän Coast and -- regardless of your ability -- not jump in a kayak (rather than a canoe, which are more suited to Sweden's lakes than coastal waters). Read more: 10 things to know before visiting Sweden . For starters, there are no strong currents or dangerous tidal waters here. Thanks to the Gulf Stream, the water is warm and the islands mostly easy to get to. Plenty of sheltered coves let novice paddlers practice, while the more experienced paddlers can head out to the North Sea. Born in a boat . Many Swedes appear to have been born in a kayak. Around Bohuslän, kayakers cluster in the car-free Koster Islands in the Kosterhavet, Sweden's first marine national park. Popular, too, are the rocky islands of the Fjällbacka archipelago, the Weather Islands (Väderöarna), Sweden's most westerly, and the larger islands of Orust and Tjörn. Read more: How to see Stockholm like Stieg Larsson . Some of the islands have guesthouses or, thanks to the country's freedom-to-roam law, you can pitch your tent and hike pretty much wherever you like (bar some protected spots). Reindeer, mink and seal are among the animals you might encounter in this still wild place -- plus ever-present seabirds. Flying in . Most overseas visitors fly into Gothenburg. Once dominated by its industrial seaport, Sweden's second-largest city is now an increasingly lively and cosmopolitan place. It's worth spending a day or two here to visit Scandinavia's largest amusement park, Liseberg, or to get a taste of Swedish coffee culture -- the famous fika. A recommended stopping place as you drive up the coast is Fjällbacka, a fishing village about an hour and a half north of Gothenburg. It's an undeniably pretty place -- any cloying potential is offset by the fact that resident crime writer Camilla Läckberg sets her grisly murders here. Read more: How to build a Swedish ice hotel . A short drive further north is Grebbestad, where 90% of Sweden's oysters come from.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The nation's new chief intelligence officer delivered the annual threat assessment to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, but his first topic was the economy. Dennis Blair said the worldwide effects of the economic crisis could lead to instability in governments. ""The primary near-term security concern of the United States is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical implications,"" said Dennis Blair, who was approved last month as the director of national intelligence for President Obama. Blair said the worldwide effects of the economic crisis -- from countries cutting back on their defense obligations to their mishandling of humanitarian issues -- could lead to instability in governments. Such instability could help foster terrorist movements and activities, Blair said. ""Time is probably our greatest threat,"" Blair said in prepared remarks released before he spoke to the committee. ""The longer it takes for the recovery to begin, the greater the likelihood of serious damage to U.S. strategic interests."" In his first appearance before Congress in his new post, Blair addressed topics ranging from cyber-terrorism to al Qaeda. Asked by committee member Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, about the possibility of a cyber-terrorism attack on the nation's power-grid system, Blair said that ""a couple of years ago, (it would have been) a piece of cake."" Changes and security upgrades in the system have reduced the possibility of a debilitating attack on the power system, Blair said. But ""a very skilled attack by a group that knew what it was doing could cause us some problems, so there's work still to be done there,"" he said. Extremist Muslim groups still pose the biggest threat for terrorist attacks, but there has been ""notable progress"" in turning Muslim opinion against such groups, including al Qaeda, he said. ""Because of the pressure we and our allies have put on al Qaeda's core leadership in Pakistan and the continued decline of al Qaeda's most prominent regional affiliate in Iraq, al Qaeda today is less capable and effective than it was a year ago,"" he added. Regarding Iran's nuclear-development capabilities, Blair said that nation ""is clearly developing all the components of nuclear material."" He estimated that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon by 2015. The United States and other Western nations believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, but Iran says it is developing nuclear capability to produce energy. International pressure will be the main factor in getting Iran to drop any nuclear military aspirations, Blair said. ""Whether they (Iran) take it all the way to developing nuclear arms and becoming a nuclear power -- I don't think it's a done deal either way,"" he said. But he added that getting Iran to stay away from nuclear military development will take a concerted international effort. ""It's not going to be like falling off a log,"" he said.","National intelligence chief says global crisis could destabilize foreign governments .

"(CNN) -- Greece is hoping a derelict airport on the outskirts of Athens -- one which has sparked a keen contest among international investors -- will help solve its debt woes. Hellinikon airport, the sale of which initially piqued the interest of U.S. business tycoon Donald Trump, could be vital to reversing the fortunes of the Greek economy. Greece is awaiting a financial lifeline of 31.5 billion euros [$40.3 billion] from international creditors, following the approval of a 13.5 billion euro austerity package by Greek lawmakers earlier this month. Alongside aid packages and austerity measures, Greece is selling off assets from gas reserves to sewage works as it tries to gain control of its 340 billion euro pile of debt. And while the potential sale of Greece's coveted islands caught early -- and controversial -- headlines, hopes are now resting on the dilapidated airport as a potential economic savior. Four property developers -- Elbit Cochin Island Ltd, Lamda Development, London and Regional Properties and Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment -- have been shortlisted by the Hellenic Republic Assets Development Fund (HRADF) to win exclusive rights to the site. The bidders did not respond or were unavailable for immediate comment. A fund spokesman declined to disclose the airport's potential purchase price but says redeveloping the land will cost around 6 billion euros. The fund has projected a redevelopment of the site will bolster Greece's gross domestic product, which has contracted by 39.5 billion euros in the past five years to 171.4 billion euros, by 0.3% over the next ten years. Greece's vast, derelict, symbol of hope . Hellinikon airport was once Greece's flagship terminal and hub for international travel, but has been abandoned since its closure in 2001. It stretches across 6.2 million square meters -- making it roughly twice as big as New York's Central Park -- and it represents a huge commercial project for investors. The Greek government has put the full plot of land up for sale in an effort to raise revenues, spur growth and create jobs. The site is the largest open regeneration project in Europe and could create up to 9,000 jobs immediately, according to the HRADF. But 6 billion euros is a significant sum to inject into a country whose financial crisis has left the eurozone teetering on break-up. ""The Greek financial system is in trouble and it's very difficult to raise this kind of money in the private sector,"" the fund spokesman told CNN. ""Also, the international banking system has not been prepared to take that kind of risk on Greece up to now."" Theofanis Exadaktylos, an academic from the Greek Politics Specialist Group and a lecturer at the University of Surrey, says the sale of Hellinikon airport is a ""priority"" for the government and would boost the local economy. He told CNN: ""It could provide space for tourism, housing or entertainment... It's a big, big scale investment."" Greece has valued its sell-able assets at 50 billion euros, with 55% of it in real estate, including Hellinikon. Europe's most indebted nation has set a target to privatize 25 billion euros of these assets by 2020. Proposals from foreign investors are first considered by a board of directors and overseen by representatives from Greece's international creditors, known as the ""troika."" A shortlist is then drawn up and ultimately, the highest bidder wins. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and his coalition government are hoping that privatization will increase competitiveness and make up for cuts in the public sector, particularly in jobs. Could Greece's coveted islands be up for sale? Some eurozone politicians have advocated the country sell off more than just its infrastructure projects. Greece's islands, which draw tourist dollars and showcase the country's beauty, have previously been flagged as potential investment gold. In October Frank Schaeffler, a German member of Parliament and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, told CNN Samaras himself said Greece is willing to sell its uninhabited islands. Samaras' office did not respond to the comment. But while the idea might seem unpalatable, Exadaktylos believes leasing the islands -- if such a program was properly managed and debated -- wouldn't be a bad idea. Exadaktylos noted shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis had leased the island of Skorpios in the Ionian Sea, where he married Jackie O, previously the wife of U.S. president John F Kennedy. Exadaktylos added leases for islands ""may last for 99 years and then possibly there is an option to renew, but investors do not own the island, so there is no issue of state sovereignty."" Meanwhile, the HRDAF continues to try and draw investors into the country, soothing nervousness around the country's two bailouts, a hefty debt restructuring and two elections.","Greece is selling off assets from gas reserves to sewage works as it seeks to contain its debt woes .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- Desperation grew among Filipinos who've been without electricity or shelter for more than a week since Super Typhoon Haiyan reduced homes to splinters, prompting the military to alter rescue maneuvers, an official said Saturday. ""People swarm the helicopters, so we land the helicopters a little bit farther from the population areas,"" said Maj. Gen. Romer Poquiz of the Philippine Air Force. ""So before the people come in, we would take off, go and drop in other places, drop and then go, drop, go, drop, go, at various places."" Several countries, including the U.S. military, continued to assist Philippine authorities in a massive relief effort of delivering food and water to the devastated swaths of the archipelago. The central government is being criticized for a slow and disorganized response to what all agree is a catastrophic disaster. The U.S. military may rotate out the aircraft carrier group with the USS George Washington once amphibious ships arrive, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. Relief efforts were also showing a lot of field hospital capability, the official said. Meanwhile, military planes and helicopters delivered foodstuffs, and some people carried all that remained of their possessions and were lucky enough to be ferried to refuge in Cebu. U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Royal Navy's HMS Daring was scheduled to arrive Sunday morning and assist the relief efforts. An disclosed number of British nationals remain unaccounted for, Hague said. The toll remains overwhelming with thousands dead, about 3 million people displaced, vast communities flattened and looting and violence erupting in Tacloban, a major city that's the ground zero in the super typhoon strike. Crews continued to collect bodies from streets, with the death toll increased Sunday to 3,681, according to the official death count. The number of injured stood at 12,544, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported. At least 1,186 were missing. The death toll could still climb higher, with an additional 1,000 cadaver bags sent to provinces, the disaster council announced as search-and-rescue operations continued in Tacloban City. The national disaster council's executive director, Eduardo Del Rosario, said the bags would be placed on standby, given that most of the bodies had already been buried in mass graves or claimed by relatives. Cadaver bags are cleaned before being reused, he said. The Philippines News Association reported Friday that five-person teams that include a forensic expert and photographer would begin using a ""quick system"" for the bodies on Saturday. ""Under the system, the public will not be allowed to view the identification process, but relatives will be asked to participate in the final identification of corpses at an appointed time,"" it reported, citing the Department of Health. Each team will be required to handle 40 corpses per day, it said. Health Secretary Enrique Ona said that photos will be taken, identifying marks will be documented and belongings and tissue samples for possible use in DNA testing will be collected, when practical. The arrival in recent days of hundreds of aid workers and military troops has seen a floodgate of humanitarian aid -- food, water and medical supplies -- open, albeit sporadically, in the hard hit provinces. A senior U.S. military official said approximately 9,000 U.S. troops are supporting the operation in the Philippines. U.S. military assets have delivered approximately 623,000 pounds of relief supplies. Under a hot sun, refugees held umbrellas as they waited in line for provisions. Some wore masks apparently as protection from the rot and decay of their obliterated communities. The nation's disaster agency said between 9 million and 13 million people were affected in 44 provinces, 536 municipalities and 55 cities. Jethro Mullen reported from Tacloban. Ben Brumfield reported in Atlanta and Michael Martinez reported and wrote in Los Angeles. CNN's Barbara Starr, Nana Karikari-apau and Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- This year's race for best actor at the Academy Awards was supposed to have been the most wide open in decades, with candidates ranging from two-time winner Tom Hanks for ""Captain Phillips"" to newcomer Oscar Isaac for ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" The 77-year-old veteran Bruce Dern gave a signature performance as an addled senior citizen in ""Nebraska,"" while Leonardo DiCaprio delivered a flamboyant tour de force in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" And it was a banner year for black actors, with the Oscar-worthy performances of Forest Whitaker in ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" Michael B. Jordan in ""Fruitvale Station"" and Chiwetel Ejiofor in ""12 Years a Slave."" Now, with voting completed and less than a couple days away from Oscar night, the pundits, prognosticators and tea-leaf readers agree that the winner will be ... none of the above. Hanks, Isaac, Whitaker and Jordan weren't even nominated. But Matthew McConaughey was. And as the AIDS patient who smuggles unapproved but effective medication to help others with the disease in ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" McConaughey raised his ever-expanding professional profile as a versatile leading man while showing he could physically commit to his work. He shed almost 50 pounds and, going further, secluded himself from social interaction to achieve the gaunt pallor of a dying man. That level of investment, combined with an intense performance, combined to make McConaughey such a prohibitive favorite for the best actor prize that, even with such sterling competition as Dern, DiCaprio, Ejiofor and Christian Bale, who gained weight and wore a comb-over wig as a con artist in ""American Hustle,"" it would be a stunner if he loses. If ... OK, fine, when McConaughey steps to the winner's circle Sunday night after his name is announced, it will represent the latest manifestation of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences' historic tendency to honor actors who make heads swivel by changing their image, professional or physical; the more dramatic and conspicuous the transformation, the better the chances that actor, or actress, will be rewarded. For instance, 10 years ago, onetime model Charlize Theron, who at the time had gained traction in her bid for serious consideration as an actress, made herself the all-but-inevitable best actress Oscar winner in ""Monster"" by becoming unrecognizably fat and grotesque as serial killer Aileen Wuornos. Besides shaving her eyebrows and wearing prosthetic teeth, Theron had swollen her sylphlike frame by 30 pounds through heavy intakes of Stuff That Is Bad For You, mostly doughnuts and potato chips. This helped make her the -- sorry about this -- heavy favorite in a field that included then-newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes for ""Whale Rider,"" Diane Keaton for ""Something's Gotta Give,"" Naomi Watts for ""21 Grams"" and Samantha Morton for ""In America."" Bear in mind, of course, that Theron, before and since, showed keen acting chops even when assuming her regular, blade-like countenance. Doesn't matter. Pretty people rarely get Oscars looking like themselves. Cary Grant, who some believe to have been the best actor of the early sound era and beyond, only got an Oscar years after his retirement. His still-indelible turns in ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) ""Notorious"" (1946) and ""Charade"" (1963) went unacknowledged. He never let you see him act. He just did. Maybe that was the problem. Meanwhile, the template for physical-self-abasing-to-success was established back in 1980 when Robert De Niro portrayed boxer Jake La Motta. In ""Raging Bull,"" he played both the taut middleweight champ in his prime and the bloated nightclub entertainer he became. De Niro packed on 60 pounds in one of the more jarring nonmechanical special effects in movie history. Maybe he would have still won the Oscar without going to such extremes. But De Niro's efforts put him far ahead in a strong field that included career-enhancing performances by Robert Duvall in ""The Great Santini"" and Peter O'Toole in ""The Stunt Man."" Meryl Streep transformed herself into Margaret Thatcher and won the 2012 best actress Oscar for ""Iron Lady."" She thanked her makeup artists. Another example of an actor tamping down glamor for gold came when George Clooney won best supporting actor in 2006's ""Syriana."" Clooney, the exemplar of movie-star sleekness, took on facial hair and 30 pounds to play the luckless CIA agent Robert Bair. Some observers believed the Oscar was as much for Clooney's good works, including his direction of that year's critically acclaimed ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" as for his performance. But the rewards for sacrificing physical beauty were acknowledged nonetheless. The daring doesn't always work and De Niro, again, offers an example, having shed 35 pounds and worked himself into a solitary grind as a cabbie to prepare for the role of lone gunman Travis Bickle in 1976's ""Taxi Driver."" He was nominated, but lost to the late Peter Finch as the comparably unhinged Howard Beale in ""Network."" Among the many possible reasons for De Niro's deferred lead-actor Academy honor is that, at the time, he hadn't yet established an image that could be dramatically overturned or re-set in voters' minds. Because, more than anything else, even a better performance, Hollywood loves to see a performer overturn pre-existing expectations. Was Dustin Hoffman's gnarled, doomed Ratzo Rizzo in 1969's ""Midnight Cowboy"" better than John Wayne's dyspeptic, one-eyed Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit"" that same year? Maybe, but it was an all-but-foregone conclusion going into the Oscar ceremony that Wayne would get the gold statuette for mucking around with his persona. Jeff Bridges would, 30 years later, also be nominated for assuming Rooster's eye-patch and ill temper in a ""True Grit"" remake. But Bridges' sixth Oscar nomination was overshadowed by finally winning best actor the year before for portraying a seedy, recidivist country-western singer in ""Crazy Heart."" Although it was nice to see Bridges win the prize, it seemed to many critics that Bridges had by then submitted more than a dozen performances that were smarter, subtler and more flattering than that of a mendacious substance abuser so in need of cash that he needs to pee in a bottle while driving between gigs. His most iconic role, The Dude in 1998's ""The Big Lebowski,"" wasn't even nominated that year. But when an actor's time has come as it did for Bridges, Wayne, De Niro, Theron and others, precedents flutter noiselessly into the California ozone. Matthew McConaughey's time, it is widely believed, has come this year through a combination of circumstance, timing, fortune -- and crash dieting. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Best Actor fave Matthew McConaughey lost 50 pounds for ""Dallas Buyers Club""

Last night a caller threatened me that I would be killed,"" said Bennet Rupasinghe, news editor of the widely read website. ""All this is because we have been posting stories critical of the government,"" he said. The office was doused with petrol and set on fire, he said. A computer screen exploded, which alerted the neighborhood. There was an earlier attack on the offices of the website last year when it was housed in Nugegoda, he said. Last year, the editor of the website, Sandaruwan Senadheera, and his family fled to the United Kingdom after reported threats to his life. ""Since he was forced to leave, I have been facing a string of threats and intimidation for exposing corruption and reporting on matters disliked by those in high authority,"" Rupasinghe said. The website's offices are now located in the Colombo suburb of Malabe. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has ordered the ""police to conduct an immediate investigation,"" spokesman Bandula Jayasekera told reporters. Lanka-e-News said journalists have suffered ""unprecedented"" losses since the president came to power, including the killing of reporters and editors. ""It is well to note that under the President Rajapaksa regime, the free media had suffered most and sustained losses to persons and property on an unprecedented scale in the media history of Sri Lanka,"" the site said.

"(CNN) -- Kim Shifren came home from school one day to find her world turned upside down. Her mom had suffered a massive heart attack; doctors said she would need weeks to recover. In a matter of minutes, the 14-year-old went from child to child caregiver. Shifren spent the next month bathing, dressing and feeding her mom before school. When she got home, she cleaned the house and made dinner. Her dad helped when he could, but he worked long hours to support the family. Two years later, Shifren had to do it all again when her mom had another heart attack. And then again when a third heart attack hit two years after that. In between, Shifren tried to be a normal teen. But the time she spent living in fear of losing her mom had a lasting impact. ""I felt that getting married and having kids just wouldn't be right, because I was so sure I would have early heart disease like my mom,"" said Shifren, now an associate professor of psychology at Towson University. ""I didn't want to put a husband and children through that experience."" It's difficult to say how many child caregivers there are in the United States. The only national survey on the topic, a 2005 report by the National Alliance for Caregiving (PDF), estimated that there were at least 1.3 million between the ages of 8 and 18 -- most caring for a parent or grandparent, some looking after a sibling. Child caregivers in the United States have largely been ignored, says Carol Levine, director of families and health care at the United Hospital Fund. While a few people, such as Top 10 CNN Hero Connie Siskowski, are working on a local level to support kids in these circumstances, a national push hasn't been forthcoming. ""These children suffer silently behind closed doors. ... They don't have the help and the support and the recognition that they need,"" Siskowski said. Who should be CNN Hero of the Year? Cast your vote . Is it simply that people don't know that child caregivers exist, Levine wonders, or are they ignoring the problem because they don't know how to help? ""People don't want to think of children providing care,"" Levine said. ""For whatever reason, it suits people not to see it."" More studies have been done in Australia and the United Kingdom, giving experts some insight on the lives of these children. From administering medication to providing emotional support, being a caregiver can prove exhausting, especially for a child who's still in school. These studies abroad have shown that child caregivers are more likely to fall asleep in class and fall behind on assignments. The children are often socially isolated too because they don't have time to hang out or can't bring friends home. ""Kids don't want to be singled out,"" Levine said. ""They're very afraid of being different. Being a caregiver is being different."" The long-term effects of being a child caregiver aren't well studied. Levine has seen these kids grow up to be mature, responsible adults who are closely connected to their families. They show evidence of having high self-esteem, more empathy and a strong sense of belonging. Many she knows have gone into the health-care industry or social work so they can continue to care for others. But she says her organization doesn't see the child caregivers who get lost, the ones who wind up in jail or on the streets because they had too much to deal with at home. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research analyzed data from 1,200 students in two Florida school districts. Researchers found that child caregivers were at a significantly higher risk for anxiety and depression. Gail Hunt, CEO of the National Alliance for Caregiving, says many child caregivers develop behavioral problems; boys in particular exhibit aggressive and antisocial tendencies. According to a 2006 study (PDF), 22% of high school dropouts in the United States leave school to care for a family member. Many continue to care for their loved ones into adulthood, Hunt says. Some, like Shifren, resist getting -- or staying -- married. ""I think sometimes it's the forming of relationships,"" Hunt said. ""Something about that issue has made it difficult for them."" Shifren is hoping to do more studies on child caregivers and the long-term effects they face. She's working with Levine, Siskowski and Hunt to spread the word about this hidden population. ""It isn't going to go away,"" Shifren said. ""The issue will only get bigger."" Hunt says that addressing the problem has to begin at home. Many parents fear that their children will be taken away if they admit they're being cared for. Teachers also need to be taught, Hunt says, to identify the children who are at risk. Providing a local support network for kids who are ""different"" will help them feel less so. Levine says other countries have had great success with camp-like programs that give child caregivers a free day, weekend or week. It's not therapy, she says, it's just recreation time so that the kids can be kids. ""These are our children, and we should be able to do something for them,"" Levine said. ""My guess is, it wouldn't take a whole lot to make a difference.""","Survey estimates there are at least 1.3 million child caregivers in the United States .

Top 10 CNN Hero Connie Siskowski: They ""suffer silently behind closed doors"""
"(CNN) -- ""Where do you live?"" Facebook highlights territorial disputes, such as one between Israel and Syria over Golan Heights. Seems like a simple question, doesn't it? But the answer is not clear-cut for everyone. Take people who live in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, which is wedged between India, Pakistan and China. India and Pakistan have gone to war repeatedly over the disputed territory. Technically, it's ""Indian-administered."" But on Facebook, it's simply in India. Shujaat Bukhari, a journalist in Srinagar, was slightly uncomfortable about the classification. ""As far as the traditions of the people are concerned, the political issues, it might not match with the people's mindset,"" he said, even while conceding it could be seen as accurate. ""It is administratively part of India, so as far as that is concerned, it is correct,"" he said. ""But it doesn't gel with the mood of the people."" The Indian government is very sensitive about how international media organizations characterize Kashmir, he said by phone from Srinagar. ""If the Economist (magazine) publishes a map which is related to India or Kashmir, if that map is not acceptable to the Indian government, they put a stamp when (the magazine) reaches India saying these maps should not be treated as as authentic,"" he said. Srinagar is just one of many examples of the diplomatic minefields social-networking sites can stray into when seeking basic information about their users. Facebook recently changed its listing for the Golan Heights -- which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 -- so users there could choose to say whether they live in Israel or Syria. It was responding to pressure from a pro-Israel group called HonestReporting -- and from Facebook users who set up a group on the site itself called ""Facebook, Golan Residents Live in Israel, not Syria."" ""It is not for Facebook to decide the national origin of Golan residents,"" the group says on its page. Facebook may have pleased pro-Israel users there by giving them the choice to say where they live, but not all Syrians were happy about the change. ""I think Facebook sort of shot itself in the foot to make it optional for the Golan to say this is part of Israel,"" said Ammar Abdulhamid, a Syrian scholar based in the United States. ""This is against international law,"" he said. And the Golan is only the tip of the iceberg. Jerusalem, which remains hotly disputed between Israel and the Palestinians, is simply in Israel as far as Facebook is concerned. Tibet's capital Lhasa is in China on Facebook, although many Tibetans and their supporters reject China's rule of Tibet. The ""Free Tibet"" group on Facebook has nearly 188,000 members. Russia and the former Soviet republic of Georgia briefly went to war last summer over the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but the Abkhaz capital Sukhumi is listed as being in Georgia on Facebook. Two pro-independence Abkhaz Facebook groups have about 1,200 members between them. The social-networking site ""deals with the listings for disputed territories on a case-by-case basis,"" Facebook representative Debbie Frost told CNN by e-mail. She said the site -- which recently announced it has 300 million users -- consults the International Organization for Standardization, the United Nations and other global organizations. ""We also may consider other factors when trying to determine if dual listings would make sense for a given city or region. For example, Srinagar -- the example you gave -- is in the Indian-administered region, and has been since 1947,"" she said. ""We will continue to look at the listings we provide and may offer more dual listings in (the) future. We will also listen to requests from our users and in the cases of disputed territories we may try to come up with options that enable them to choose one of two countries,"" she added. Bukhari, the journalist in disputed Srinagar, suggests that Facebook ""should have a separate section for disputed areas."" That's a solution that Yahoo appears to have embraced -- up to a point. It offers ""disputed territory"" as an option for users creating a new account, but won't actually register a new account if users choose that option. It does allow users to say they are from Taiwan -- which China considers a renegade province and is not represented at the United Nations -- and the ""Occupied Palestinian Territories."" But it does not appear to allow users to create an account if they choose ""Occupied Palestinian Territories."" It does not offer Tibet, Kashmir or Abkhazia. Google, for its part, offers Taiwan and ""Palestinian Territories,"" as well as Western Sahara, a breakaway region of Morocco that is not recognized internationally. It does not offer Tibet, Kashmir or Abkhazia. Neither Yahoo nor Google responded to repeated CNN requests for comment. But if Facebook's experience with the Golan Heights is any indication, they may all be getting comments from users soon enough. CNN's Tricia Escobedo and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Facebook's ""Where do you live"" question causes problems for some .
Those who live in disputed territories are unsure how to answer .

"(CNN) -- Now that warmer spring sunshine is bathing the streets of Kiev, the charred remains from the attacks on the central city are far more evident. The sunshine is also warming up debate on the future of the downtown core, which has served since last November as the heart of the protest against the regime of deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. This weekend Ukrainians will mark the end of the traditional 40 days of mourning for the at least 100 protesters that were mowed down by sniper, grenade and other live fire during and around February 20. Until now, the area around the main square, where the attacks took place, has served as a massive memorial -- framed by mountains of flowers, drawings, photos, candles and poems. Earlier this week a group of men were preparing to build a permanent chapel behind the Hotel Ukraina, one of the vantage points for snipers and a makeshift emergency clinic during the February 20 shootings. Read more: Maidan before -- and after . To many, parts of Maidan are gaining the look of semi-permanency. On any given morning activists line up at soup kitchens. Protesters from far flung regions show no sign of going home and appear dug in for a prolonged stay. At the far end of the encampment, a commandeered militia water canon truck serves as a gigantic trophy (and makeshift barricade) for the people's victory over government forces. The conventional thinking is that the protest movement will stay well after the scheduled May 25 presidential elections -- longer if they go into a second, run-off round. 'Medieval village' While the passion and commitment of this open display of raw people power is impressive, there are those, including retailers and city center residents, who would like to see the protest site shrunk to a few small blocks. One American journalist said derisively last week that the Maidan, with its soot-covered tents, tattered residents, and crude, rusting barricades, resembles a ""medieval village."" And one nearby resident told me that she and others are fed up with the traffic snarls caused by the sprawling encampment. But there is more to Maidan than just the physical presence of tents and hardened protesters. It has served as a stage to mint new popular leaders -- such as Volodymyr Parasiuk, 26, a student activist from Lviv who stood up on the Maidan stage on Feb 21 and threatened Yanukovych with an armed overthrow. It was also the very same stage taken briefly by former prime minister and presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko on February 22, shortly after her release from prison -- a humiliating appearance which showed how terribly out of sync she had fallen with the street after three years behind bars. Olga Bogomolets, a volunteer doctor (and also presidential candidate) who treated many injured protesters on February 20, suggested Thursday that the Maidan is one huge, open-air crime scene and that international forensic experts have yet to make an appearance to collect evidence. In fact one of the most popular displays is a collection of organ-piercing bullets, grenade shells and other lethal projectiles fired at protesters by the now-disbanded Berkut forces in February. Another face of Maidan, the immensely popular Eurovision star Ruslana, insists that the protest site must stay put as a kind of check and balance on the new interim government -- and as a psychological barricade to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I believe that even today that same Maidan has a critical role to play in stopping Putin. While Maidan still exists, nothing will work out for Putin."" Voice of Ukrainian street . There's little doubt that Maidan represents the voice of the Ukrainian street: after the excesses of the Yanukovych government and the failed promises of the administration of the pro-Western Viktor Yuschenko, public trust in public officials is at an all-time low. Markian Melnyk, a protester from a small town near Kiev, says he has been at Maidan since January after unidentified men took away his credit union business. Until the people have had a chance to vote in a new president, many protest leaders will continue to see themselves as the guardians of the people, almost to the point that they have veto power over major decisions. Hence there is believed to be a large arms cache on site -- most arms hidden away but some proudly worn by self-appointed self-defense forces who man the various entrances to the Maidan. The huge stage has become a forum for leaders to swing out at bad decisions, or simply to take swipes at Putin for his brazen land grab of Crimea. When there are no speakers, a giant screen streams live sessions of the Parliament or the newly-found independent TV channels that themselves symbolize the post-Yanukovych era. It is not a stretch in the least to say that there's probably no one more eager to see Maidan disappear than Putin, whose pliant media machine has painted the movement as nothing more than right-wing Banderites, fascists and terrorists. That's probably why the protest leaders have been so careful to protect the semblance of order from provocateurs or stop any violent outbreaks. Sadly, Maidan could figure into Putin's twisted logic for moving his armed forces as far inland as Kiev should he decide to invade more of Ukraine. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Bociurkiw.","This weekend, Ukrainians mark the end of 40 days mourning for those killed in Maidan square .

"Washington (CNN) -- Richard Lugar had it all -- a sterling global reputation, bipartisan respect, a fat campaign bank account and 36 years of Senate experience. But somewhere along the line he forgot Tip O'Neill's old axiom: all politics is local. On Tuesday, that mistake cost Lugar his career. The 80-year-old pillar of Washington's foreign policy establishment lost his Indiana GOP primary battle to a younger, hungrier and more politically attuned conservative challenger, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock. Lugar loses Republican primary . The venerable senator's finished. Chalk up another win for the tea party. Lugar ""served too long,"" said Republican pollster Christine Matthews, who did public opinion research for the race. ""We're in a new era. He never adapted."" The list of conservative complaints against Lugar has grown over the last several years, a period coinciding with an aggressive campaign to rid the GOP of officeholders who fail to march in lockstep with the party's ideological activists. Lugar voted for Obama Supreme Court nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, advocated a hike in the gas tax, backed immigration reform, opposed an earmark spending ban and supported the financial and auto industry bailouts. He was the Senate GOP's most prominent supporter of a new arms control treaty with Russia, America's ""number one geopolitical foe,"" according to Mitt Romney. Lugar was once called Obama's favorite Republican senator, a fact Mourdock's campaign repeated endlessly. With friends like that, conservatives asked, who needs enemies? ""It all adds up,"" said GOP pollster John McLaughlin, who helped Lugar in the past but is working for Mourdock this time. It ""goes against (Indiana primary voters') conservative values."" Lugar's ""campaign was not very nimble or adept at responding to some of the charges against him,"" one Indiana Republican operative said. ""You have to react and you have to pivot"" when challenged. There was ""a failure to remind people what Dick Lugar has done for this state, this country, and this world."" To the end, Lugar kept the support of establishment Republican leaders like Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels and Arizona Sen. John McCain. But insurgent icons like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum flocked to Mourdock's banner. Perhaps more importantly, outside conservative groups like FreedomWorks and Club for Growth poured pro-Mourdock ad money into the state, obliterating what once would have been considered an insurmountable financial advantage for Lugar. None of that may have happened, however, if Lugar had paid more attention to Indiana Republicans in recent years. Most analysts contacted by CNN reached the same conclusion: Lugar's defeat is as much a reflection of the political weakness of a globetrotting elder statesman who failed to maintain ties with the folks back home as it is a sign of tea party strength. Mourdock is ""the uber-accessible guy,"" the operative noted. ""Any (state party) event you go to, there should be a Mourdock name tag printed out because chances are he's showing up. ... He's at every chili cook-off imaginable."" The operative noted that Lugar rarely if ever showed up to local Republican Party events in recent years. Not coincidentally, the overwhelming majority of local GOP officials backed Mourdock. There was a feeling among the GOP's county chairmen that Lugar is ""too big for us, and he's too good for us,"" Matthews said. In contrast, the operative said, Indiana's other GOP senator, Dan Coats, assiduously courted grassroots activists and local party leaders when he decided to return to elected office in Indiana after more than a decade working as a diplomat and a Washington lobbyist. While Coats wasn't a tea party favorite when he won the GOP nod in 2010, his hard work on the local level helped him beat back a primary challenge from a couple of candidates more strongly favored by conservatives. A number of analysts said Lugar should have followed the lead of Senate colleague Orrin Hatch, who committed significant time and resources to his own renomination fight this year. Two years ago, Hatch saw fellow Utah Sen. Robert Bennett lose his GOP nomination battle to political newcomer Mike Lee. Bennett, a fairly conservative three-term Senate veteran, failed to see the tea party storm coming in 2010 and paid the price at that year's Utah GOP convention. After Bennett's loss, Hatch furiously cultivated the support of local activists. In April, he won the support of an overwhelming majority of delegates at the state convention. He is now expected to easily win his primary and roll to victory in the general election. For many Indiana Republicans, a controversy earlier this year over Lugar's residence crystallized the perception that he had abandoned them. Lugar, who actually has lived in northern Virginia since the sale of his Indianapolis home in 1977, was forced to beat back a ballot eligibility challenge based on the location of his current home. Lugar successfully argued that Indiana's constitution only required him to maintain a physical residence in the state during his first campaign. Politically, however, the damage was done. At one point, Lugar admitted he wasn't even sure what address was on his Indiana driver's license. Indiana politics, the operative noted, has a long history of residency-based ballot access controversies. Coats faced a similar challenge when he returned to the state to run for Senate in 2010. ""In and of itself, I don't think it would have worked,"" the operative said. But Lugar is ""casting these (controversial) votes because he's never here and doesn't hear us."" The residency issue was more potent this time around ""because it fits the overall narrative."" The challenge to Lugar's residency, McLaughlin told CNN, ""was saying he's really gone to Washington and doesn't even live here anymore."" Why, he wondered, didn't Lugar ""just buy a condo?"" Two-thirds of primary voters in Mourdock's campaign polls said Lugar has been in Washington too long and is out of touch with Hoosier values, McLaughlin added. Mourdock, in contrast, has pledged to serve only two terms in Washington. Mourdock also maintained a ""respectful"" tone while challenging the veteran senator, McLaughlin added. Mourdock ""stood up in (his) one debate (with Lugar) and was credible,"" Matthews said. He may have been the favorite of the most conservative voters, but ""nobody could say he's a whack job."" Now Mourdock is probably going to Washington. And Lugar, a hero of the Washington establishment, is headed home, wherever that is.","Lugar lost primarily because he didn't pay attention to his Indiana GOP base .
Lugar took a series of positions out of line with current GOP orthodoxy .
Lugar's failure to keep an Indiana residence showed him as out of touch .
Richard Mourdock paid close attention to Indiana's GOP grassroots ."
"(CNN) -- A Mercedes more than a half-century old and driven by one of Formula One's most famous racers, Juan Manuel Fangio, became the most expensive car ever sold at an auction, according to the auctioneer. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196R fetched $29.65 million Friday at the auction in southern England, said Bonhams, with the identity of the buyer not disclosed. That figure beat the previous record -- a 1957 Ferrari was purchased in 2011 -- by about $13 million, added Bonhams. ""I have handled some of the world's most desirable and important motor cars during a motoring auction career spanning five decades, but I have reached a peak with this legendary grand prix car,"" Robert Brooks, the Bonhams chairman, said. ""It was a personal privilege to preside over the sale of this vehicle, which is not only one of the most significant motor cars of the 20th century but also the most important historic grand prix racing car ever offered for sale,"" he added. Argentina's Fangio used the car en route to winning the second of his five world titles. Soon after it was placed in a museum. Fangio won a record 45 percent of the grand prix he entered and started nearly 60 percent of his races from pole position -- reigning Formula One king Sebastian Vettel doesn't come close to matching that. He won the championship with four different teams -- the only man to achieve the feat -- and is also the oldest Formula One champion, claiming the title in 1957 at the age of 46. ""If he were here today Fangio would shake his head and smile his slow smile,"" Doug Nye, a racing historian, told Bonhams' website. ""He was a humble man, originally a mechanic from a potato town in Argentina and never forgot his roots.

"(CNN) -- There's been another shutdown, but instead of spineless politicians, you can blame invertebrate sea creatures. A large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling-water intake at a major Swedish nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor this week, according to OKG, the company that runs the plant. ""The operations management at unit O3 chose to disconnect the facility from the grid at noon on Sunday due to a large amount of jellyfish present at the cooling water intake,"" an OKG statement said. ""This decision is a preventive safety measure in order for the unit to not be automatically shut down due to too-low cooling in the condenser."" OKG did not immediately return CNN calls seeking comment, but numerous media outlets reported that Oskarhamn Unit 3 was back up and running Wednesday. ""Furthermore we have reinforced our clearing system to deal with any future jellyfish invasions,"" the outlets quoted OKG as saying in a statement. The company noted that the cooling water was used to cool steam before it went into the reactor, and the ""water has no connection to the cooling of the reactor vessel."" The plant, located 19 miles north of Oskarshamn on the southeast Baltic coast, is Sweden's first commercial nuclear plant, commissioned in 1972, and the third reactor went into operation in 1985. It has an output capacity of 1,450 megawatts. The plant's three reactors account for 10% of Sweden's electricity generation, OKG says.

"(CNN) -- Amid the rubble, you see a child's toy, clothing, furniture, family photographs. Homes that once sheltered families now ripped open, their insides spilling out like intestines. These haunting images were captured in Aleppo in June by Italian photographer Matteo Rovella. While many photographers concentrate on the faces of Syria's brutal conflict, Rovella saw another side: what happens when a person's private space becomes ripped open by war. ""You see such scenes, and you imagine the moment when people had to escape from the rooms,"" he said. ""I imagine the people who must run away -- or die."" Rovella had visited several camps on both sides of the Syria-Turkey border in early 2013. Thanks to a friend in the city keeping him up to date with events, he decided in June to head to the Syrian city of Aleppo, which has been ravaged in fighting between government and rebel fighters. Syrians take steps toward healing . After organizing a car ride with a man from the Free Syrian Army, the main opposition rebel force, he crossed the border from Turkey. Many journalists choose to enter with the rebels for better access and less censorship than with the Syrian government, he said. The trip to Aleppo involved nerve-jangling encounters with armed checkpoints and constant fear of discovery. Just carrying a camera was dangerous, he said, particularly since the abduction of several foreign journalists in the country. ""There are many independent armed gangs, and they could stop you, rob you, kidnap you and in the worst case, kill you."" When he arrived in Aleppo and began to work, photographing and interviewing Free Syrian Army fighters and local residents, he saw much of the city's precious historical monuments damaged or destroyed and neighborhoods smashed to pieces. At one point, while he was interviewing a local rebel commander, a mortar wheeled overhead, slamming into two fighters less than 100 meters from him. ""It was horrible. And strange, as it felt like I was not there, maybe because of the camera creating distance, just working inside my (camera) viewer,"" he said. ""In truth, of course, you are very much there, and you're risking your life."" After a few days, Rovella began documenting the devastation through a series of evocative images of abandoned and destroyed homes that had been attacked over the course of the conflict. Almost all the people he met over the course of his visit had lost part or all of their homes. ""It's something like still-life photography, but you can see inside the homes tensions and fear, the moments of violence, how you were obligated to leave your things, your home, your life and go away, maybe to not come back."" Nearly 700 killed in Syria rebel infighting . It was dangerous work. Many of the buildings are now lookout points for the Free Syrian Army and targeted by government attacks. He often found himself sprinting with rebel fighters from one building to the next. ""I was walking through buildings and taking pictures very fast,"" he said. ""But I tried to do it in an artistic way. "" Now back in Italy, he feels that the images of abandoned buildings show how the calm of everyday home life can suddenly, terribly, be shattered forever. ""It is a way to sensitize people to the war,"" he said of his images. ""I think my testimony could be a little piece more to help the Syrians. A very tiny piece of help.""","Italian photographer spent six weeks in Aleppo documenting impact of Syria's conflict .

"(CNN) -- Glance at Floyd Mayweather's complex life story and it's hard not to be reminded of the lyrics to Sly and the Family Stone's classic song: ""It's a Family Affair"" --- ""Blood's thicker than the mud, it's a family affair."" To start with there is the boxer's relationship with his father, which has such a degree of bad blood that even psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud might have trouble exploring the demons that have been unleashed between father and son. In May, the pair were professionally reunited for the first time in 13 years as Floyd Sr. worked the corner during his son's successful welterweight title defense against Robert Guerrero. The intervening years had been characterized by bitter rows and public slanging matches as the Mayweathers fell out to such extent that Floyd Sr. once told reporters he did not even know the names of two of his grandchildren. But as the man nicknamed ""Money"" returned to the ring for the first time since serving a two-month jail term for a domestic violence conviction, he enlisted the help of his father. The official reason for his return two months ago was that the five-division world champion's regular trainer -- Floyd Sr.'s brother Roger -- was too debilitated by diabetes to be relied upon. Mayweather Sr. had last taken charge of Floyd's corner in 2000 prior to being booted out of his son's house, and life, shortly after. Defensive nous . A notable feature of Floyd Jr.'s unanimous points decision over Guerrero, the WBC's interim champion while Mayweather was in prison, became the fact that he had tightened up his defense -- a product of his father's work, the fighter says. ""My dad is a remarkable trainer, a defensive wizard,"" the man with the 44-0 record told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""My dad brings everything. It all started with my father. What's been installed in me from the beginning is the less you get hit, the longer you last in the sport. My father was right."" Floyd Sr. knows about the importance of avoiding major injury all too well. He has frequently recounted how he was shot in the leg by Tony Sinclair -- the later brother of Floyd Jr.'s mother -- in 1978 . ""I got shot early in my career with a 20 gauge shotgun,"" Floyd Sr. has said. ""And I was holding my son when I got shot. Floyd was one at the time."" Floyd Sr. was holding his son during the shooting incident to ensure he was not hit in the face or upper body - a move that he believes saved his life. ""I wasn't going to put that baby down,"" Floyd Sr. told the Los Angeles Times in 2012. ""I didn't want to die. It wasn't about putting my son in the line of fire. I knew [Sinclair] wouldn't shoot the baby. So he took the gun off my face, lowered it to my leg and bam!"" Floyd Jr.'s defensive skills are such that he has long been known as ""Pretty Boy"" because of the fact he has boxed his many bouts so well his face has been largely unblemished. ""It was basically for not taking any punishment,"" said Floyd Jr. ""You know, I can't be over the age of 30 calling myself 'Pretty Boy'. I'm a man."" His fight against Guerrero was the first of a six-part deal with Showtime, with every bout worth at least $32m to a sportsman named as the highest earner by Forbes magazine for 2012. When he signed the 30-month deal in February, the 36-year-old Mayweather said it would be his last as a professional fighter and that he would be retiring when the contract ended. But he seems to have had a change of heart given comments he made on Monday while promoting his next fight -- against 22-year-old Mexican sensation Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez in September. ""After my five more fights, guess what? I think after (getting to) 49-0 we may stay in this sport a little longer,"" Mayweather told a crowd some 5,000 strong at the Alamo in San Antonio. There has been speculation that Mayweather's decision to recall his father reveals a desire to finally bury the hatchet, with the 60-year-old suffering from the lung disease sarcoidosis. When asked by CNN what he had learnt from his time in jail, a sentence earned after he assaulted his former partner Josie Harris -- the mother of two of his children -- in 2010, Mayweather gave the following reply. ""Never take anything for granted. As far as ... you could see a person here today and gone tomorrow. So never take anything for granted,"" he said. Family harmony . Mayweather learnt his boxing skills from his father, a former fighter who was stopped by Sugar Ray Leonard in 10 rounds in 1978, until Floyd Sr. was given a five-and-a-half-year jail term for drug trafficking when his son was 16. It meant he was absent for the bronze medal his son won at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and the start of his professional career later that year. Floyd Sr. trained his son upon his release from prison in 1998 but the pair fell out soon after, with their last fight taking place in 2000 as the then junior lightweight champion defended his title. Floyd's uncle Roger -- who won two titles himself in the 1990s -- took charge but there is little lost between the siblings, even if Floyd Jr may be trying to change this in what may prove to be his toughest fight so far. ""He figures he can (bring us together) by having us in the corner together,"" Roger told MLive.com in April. ""That's the only thing I can think of. All this time, Floyd's been with me, the whole time he's boxed. So for it to be something else, it's something that he's trying to mend."" And recent comments from Floyd Jr. do nothing to dispel the notion that a man whose career is built upon effective violence is trying to bring harmony to a warring boxing dynasty. ""The arguments we had in the past or the differences my dad and my uncle had in the pastâ€”that's the past,"" Mayweather, who is often labeled the world's best pound-to-pound boxer, said in May. ""That's why we call it the past because we try to leave that in the past and focus on the future and the future should be bright.""","Floyd Mayweather credits father for his longevity in boxing .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Wounded Syrians streamed across the Turkish border seeking first aid Wednesday after a car bombing in a border town that's become a battleground in the fight between Syrian rebel factions. The blast in the Syrian town of Jarablus shook windows about a kilometer away in the Turkish village of Karkamis, said Selami Yilmaz, a Karkamis resident. ""We don't even have enough ambulances to keep up with how many wounded are coming across,"" Yilmaz told CNN. He said he has lent his car to authorities to help get the wounded to hospitals. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the car bomb exploded near a cultural center controlled by fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. That al Qaeda-linked force has taken control of much of northern Syria amid that country's bloody civil war. The Syrian Observatory said heavy clashes were still going on in Jarablus. Haunting images of Syria's abandoned homes . ISIS, which has also taken control of parts of western Iraq, has attempted to impose strict Islamic law in towns where it holds sway. Rebel troops who had been battling forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched an effort to push back the Islamists two weeks ago, but that offensive appears to have faltered after hundreds of deaths on both sides, observers report. Yilmaz said the Free Syrian Army, the leading Western-backed rebel force, has been losing ground in Jarablus. Dozens of its fighters have fled amid intense fighting, while wounded FSA troops have been pouring across the border into Turkey for treatment. Palestinian refugees starving to death in Syrian camp . Human rights groups reported 183 deaths across Syria on Tuesday alone, all but 40 of them combatants on one side or the other. Heavy fighting between ISIS and rebel factions was under way around Aleppo, Syria's largest city, as well as the ISIS-held city of Raqqa and the border town of Saraqeb, where a Belgian man who had become the regional ISIS ""emir"" was among the dead, the Syrian Observatory reported. The group also said ISIS executed two civilians from a Kurdish village last week after they left their homes to buy bread in a nearby city. Their bodies were found with their hands tied behind their backs ""and marks from torture evident on their bodies,"" the London-based organization reported.

"(CNN) -- It's a bittersweet Christmas season for Joseph Kassab, who grew up in Iraq under Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime and now lives in Detroit, Michigan. Tempering the season's joy is his concern for fellow Iraqi Christians, who have endured killings, displacement and daily intimidation. An Iraqi policeman checks security in a Baghdad church where midnight Mass will be celebrated Wednesday. Christians in Iraq face a ""bleak future,"" said Kassab, executive director of the Chaldean Federation of America, a nonprofit group that helps Iraqi Christians. ""We are heading for a demise,"" he said. ""It's getting to the point where it might be an ethnic cleansing in the future."" A recent U.S. government report focused on the plight of Iraq's Christian minority. U.S. diplomats and legislators are worried, too. ""I think the Christians are caught in the middle of a horrible situation,"" said U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat of Assyrian and Armenian ancestry. She said Iraqi Christians are suffering as a result of ""religious cleansing,"" and she has urged more help for minorities who have fled their homes in Iraq. The Iraqi government has worked to be inclusive and accepting toward Christians, but daily intimidation has cowed the Christian community, with crosses removed from churches, priests afraid to wear their clerical garb, the faithful reluctant to attend church, and churches hiring private security guards. Iraq's Christian population has fallen from as many as 1.4 million in 2003 to between 500,000 and 700,000 more recently, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. A recent commission report outlined chilling abuse that Christians suffer in Muslim-dominated Iraq. It sounded an alarm about the treatment of minorities such as Chaldo-Assyrian Christians, an ancient people who embraced the Christian faith in its early years and still speak a form of Aramaic, the language of Jesus. Read some of report's examples of violence against Iraqi Christians . The community has endured displacement, killings and kidnappings, with churches being attacked and occupied. The U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report for 2008 says two-thirds of Christians in Iraq are Chaldeans, a branch of the Catholic Church. Almost a third are from the Assyrian Church of the East. The rest include Syriac Christians, who are Eastern Orthodox; Armenians, both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox; and Anglicans and other Protestants. Christians and other minorities represented about 3 percent of Iraq's population before 2003, but many have fled to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and other countries. The community includes many who are well-educated, including business people and professionals. They live in Baghdad and Basra, as well as in the city of Kirkuk and the autonomous Kurdish region. The Christian community is predominant in northern Iraq's Nineveh province, in the big city of Mosul and in the nearby Nineveh Plain, where many displaced Christians live. Tensions in Nineveh province heightened a few months ago, after provincial officials blocked the creation of local police forces for the Nineveh Plain. Then hundreds of Christians took to the streets in and around Mosul. They were protesting the demise of a national measure that would have included minority representation on the country's provincial councils. Fourteen Christians were killed in violence and many fled their homes. That prompted Eshoo to write to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in October about the ""rapidly deteriorating conditions for Christians in Mosul."" The commission's Elizabeth Cassidy, an international legal specialist, said the bias that Christians face in Iraq reflects ""the growing lack of diversity in that part of the world. ""It's bad for these countries that they become all one religion,"" she said. She said she fears that Muslim extremists will become predominant in Iraq. The commission gathered information from the Christian refugees who fled the sectarian violence in recent years. ""The ones we've talked to and who are outside seem to fear going back. Despite the security gains, they don't feel it's safe enough to go back,"" Cassidy said. The commission made several recommendations for the U.S. government in Iraq, such as ensuring fair provincial elections, training and deploying police to vulnerable communities, making prevention of minority abuse a priority, and distributing assistance funds fairly. One proposal calls for amending the constitution to get rid of language that gives Islam primacy. The constitution guarantees religious freedom and rights to all people, including Christians, but states unambiguously that ""Islam is the official religion of the state and is a foundation source of legislation."" Iraqi Christian activists, such as Michael Youash, project director of the Iraq Sustainable Democracy Project in Washington, favor the creation of a distinct region in the Nineveh Plain -- where neither Arabs nor Kurds predominate. He cites part of the constitution that says it ""shall guarantee the administrative, political, cultural, and educational rights of the various nationalities, such as Turkomen, Chaldeans, Assyrians, and all other constituents."" Youash, who authored a paper on the Iraqi minority crises for the American University International Law Review, warned that the demographic changes will hurt Iraq because Assyrian Christians ""are disproportionately represented in Iraq's professional and educated elite."" ""They are a significant component of the American administrative structure in Iraq,"" he said. ""This depletion of Iraq's human capital will have devastating effects throughout the country.""","Iraq's Christians face killings, intimidation; many have fled to other countries .

"(CNN) -- Racist, unfunny, hilarious, confusing, lame. A New York Post cartoon has sparked a debate over race and cartooning this week. Reactions are as varied as they are strong to Tuesday's New York Post cartoon that depicted the police shooting of a chimpanzee. Two police officers, one with a smoking gun, are near the chimp's bullet-pierced body. ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill,"" one officer says. The Post's Sean Delonas used a typical editorial cartoon trope of linking two current news stories: the shooting of a chimp after it mauled a Connecticut woman and President Obama's signing of the stimulus bill. But soon after the issue hit newsstands, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and other black opinion makers such as CNN's Roland Martin, blasted the cartoon as an attack on Obama's skin color and African-Americans in general. ""Being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama and has become synonymous with him, it is not a reach to wonder: Are they inferring that a monkey wrote the last bill?"" Sharpton said. Jelani Cobb, a Spelman College history professor and the author of a forthcoming book about Obama, told CNN that the cartoon offended on many levels. iReport.com: Chimp cartoon 'very, very wrong' He winced at the cartoon's gun violence as a stoker to the nervousness some feel about the safety of a black president in a historically racist country. ""When I looked at it, there was no getting around the implications of it,"" Cobb said. ""Clearly anyone with an iota of sense knows the close association of black people and the primate imagery."" Dozens of cartoonists weighed in on dailycartoonist.com. Some said it was a simpleton move to use the tired metaphor of a monkey to make fun of something -- no matter what it was. One poster wrote, ""Wha...?"" pointing out that Obama didn't write the stimulus package; lawmakers did. On the cartoon ""danger scale"" of 1 to 10, the chimp cartoon scored a 9, Dilbert creator Scott Adams told CNN. Adams liked the cartoon, but judging its overall worthiness is difficult, a gauge best measured by an audience, not the cartoonist, he said. ""Any cartoon has to be a little bit dangerous, and he's definitely achieved that,"" he said. ""You have to perceive that the cartoonist is in personal danger or there's something dangerous about it, that at the cartoonist's next cocktail party, half of the people there are going to want to poison his drink."" Just like George Carlin's seven dirty words, there are also no-no's for cartoons, Adams said. ""He's got everything you shouldn't have,"" he said. ""Gunfire, that's the one thing you cannot get away with. And then he's got violence against animals, also a pretty big no."" New York Post editor Col Allan referred calls to a public relations representative, who sent CNN.com this statement: ""The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event, to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut. It broadly mocks Washington's efforts to revive the economy. Again, Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist."" Delonas was not giving interviews, the PR rep told CNN. If there is any apology due, it shouldn't come from the cartoonist, insisted Ted Rall, the president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, whose cartoons run in 100 publications across the United States. An editor should object if there is a strong possibility that a cartoon will not resonate the way the cartoonist wanted, he said. Cartoonists have to be free to be creative, to not edit themselves during the drawing process. ""He was trying trying to jam two stories together, and unfortunately, this is what a lot of lame editors like,"" Rall said. ""The comparison he had in mind: The guy who wrote the package wasn't Obama; it was a bunch of white economic advisers, and he [Delonas] wasn't thinking about Obama."" The Post cartoonist, he added, has the misfortune of working in a business that, over the past decade, has become a graveyard of gag jokes. A former editor once told Rall that satire in cartooning died after September 11. ""I have to wonder about the competence of his editors,"" Rall continued. ""It goes with the 'make it shorter and dumber' mentality that's happening in print."" But later Thursday the New York Post apologized in a statement on its Web site, although they also defended its action and blasted some detractors. ""Wednesday's Page Six cartoon -- caricaturing Monday's police shooting of a chimpanzee in Connecticut -- has created considerable controversy,"" the paper said. The Post said the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an ""ineptly written"" stimulus bill. ""But it has been taken as something else -- as a depiction of President Obama, as a thinly veiled expression of racism,"" reads the statement. ""This most certainly was not its intent; to those who were offended by the image, we apologize."" But the statement immediately swerves to fire back at some of the image's critics. ""However, there are some in the media and in public life who have had differences with The Post in the past -- and they see the incident as an opportunity for payback,"" the statement says. ""To them, no apology is due. Sometimes a cartoon is just a cartoon -- even as the opportunists seek to make it something else."" Cartoonist John Auchter of the Grand Rapids Business Journal in Michigan said Delonas had to expect people to be offended. ""The racial connotation of what he drew, it's really silly that either he or his editors couldn't anticipate that [reaction],"" Auchter said. ""When I think about all the things that are thrown around here with the accusations of being racist ... that is one of the things as a cartoonist you have to be aware of -- what you're doing and that you know things are going to be taken that way. You are the first-line editor."" Syndicated political cartoonist Chip Bok didn't find the Post cartoon racist, but he said it probably was in bad taste. ""A woman was terribly mauled and almost killed,"" he said. ""That's really the only grounds by which [my editors] would throw out a cartoon. When it involves somebody's life like that, I would tend to stay away from it."" Bok knows a little about what it feels like to create a polarizing cartoon. In 2006, around the time of the Danish Mohammed cartoon controversy, the Akron Beacon Journal published a cartoon he drew showing a blurred picture of Mohammed on CNN. The cartoonist had been watching the network cover the story about Muslim anger over the Danish cartoons, which showed the prophet with a bomb crafted out of his turban. Bok was upset that CNN had chosen to blur the cartoon in its coverage. The cartoonist immediately drew his cartoon, which showed a couple watching TV and saying, ""Well, no wonder Muslims are upset. Muhammad looks like he's on acid."" ""I was inundated with e-mail, the paper was picketed,"" he said. ""There was quite a reaction.""","NEW: Post apologizes, but also defends its cartoon .

"(CNN) -- More than 200 migrants have been rescued from an overcrowded boat at risk of sinking in rough waters in the Mediterranean Sea, the Italian navy said Thursday. The alarm was raised on the evening of New Year's Day, when the boat was spotted about 80 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. The boat, which measured only 10 meters (33 feet) long, was carrying 233 people without life jackets, the navy statement said. Can world prevent more Lampedusas? Given the rough seas and the boat's ""precarious state of buoyancy,"" the decision was made to transfer the 233 people, seven of them women, to a navy ship, the San Marco. All were safely recovered, the statement said. The migrants, from Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Zambia and Mali, were all moved safely, the statement said. After being transferred to a frigate, the migrants will be taken to the port of Augusta, on the Italian island of Sicily, where they are expected to arrive Thursday evening, it said. How do illegal immigrants get into EU? Meanwhile, the Greek coast guard has rescued 85 migrants -- including 15 children and 20 women -- after their boat got into trouble in stormy weather in the southeastern Aegean Sea. They were taken to a port on the Aegean island of Astypalea, where they arrived Thursday, the coast guard said. They are being given medical help, food and other emergency supplies, the coast guard said. Greece's semiofficial Macedonian News Agency reported that the migrants are Syrians and Afghans, but the coast guard has not yet confirmed their nationality. Sea of death . As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and shipwrecks off its shores are common. Many of the migrants are from African nations, while others have fled war-torn Syria. More than 300 African migrants died in October after their ship sank off the island's shores. Days later, another 34 people died when their boat capsized. Tens of thousands of people are rescued each year from the Mediterranean, according to the European Union border agency, Frontex. Smugglers often pack migrants into unseaworthy, ill-equipped and overcrowded boats, adding to the dangers of the journey. Between January and September of last year, 31,000 migrants are believed to have entered the European Union illegally by crossing the Mediterranean to land on Italian soil or the island of Malta, Frontex said.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A U.S. Navy sailor has been found dead with a head injury at a Japanese train station, local police said Monday. Petty Officer 2nd Class Samuel Lewis Stiles was discovered surrounded by seven or eight alcoholic drink cans on the platform in Haiki Station in Nagasaki Prefecture at 5 a.m. Sunday, Haiki police said. The death, which police say they are investigating as either an accident or a crime, comes at a delicate time for the U.S. military in Japan after two U.S. sailors were arrested earlier this month on accusations they raped a local woman. That case provoked an angry reaction from Japanese officials, and the U.S. military responded by imposing a curfew on its troops in Japan. The curfew restricted military personnel to bases, personal homes or hotels between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. The time at which Stiles's body was found suggests he may have been out in breach of this curfew. He was wearing civilian clothes, not uniform, and didn't have any personal belonging around him, police said. Stiles was stationed at the U.S. base in Sasebo, the city in Nagasaki where Haiki Station is situated.","The sailor is found on a station platform .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year. The Michigan Republican made the announcement on Detroit's WJR radio station, saying he will host a syndicated radio program that will talk about national security issues and other news of the day. ""I had a career before politics and always planned to have one after,"" Rogers said in a statement. ""The genius of our institutions is they are not dependent on the individual temporary occupants privileged to serve. That is why I have decided not to seek re- election to Congress in 2014."" Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House Speaker John Boehner, has been a staunch supporter of National Security Agency surveillance programs, which came under fire after leaks by Edward Snowden publicly disclosed their sweeping nature. This week, he and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland -- the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee -- came up with a plan for ending the NSA's sweeping collection of bulk telephone records. Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA . Rogers has said in the past that the phone and electronic surveillance programs were not abused and has stridently criticized Snowden, a former NSA contractor. He also has acknowledged public worries about government storage of surveillance data. ""That's really what we're trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs,"" Rogers said recently. Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek their temporarily renewal while Congress works on reform legislation, a senior administration official said. Rogers is also a favorite of Sunday public affairs programming on which he frequently criticizes Obama. He joins a cadre of House members not seeking reelection in November, but his seat in the 8th Congressional District is still considered relatively safe for Republicans. But the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report shifted their analysis of the district from ""likely Republican"" to ""lean Republican"" for the November election following Rogers' announcement. Democrats sought to tie together Rogers and Boehner. ""Senior Republican committee chairmen continue to flee John Boehner's broken Congress rather than defend their indefensible record of siding with special interests over middle class families that has earned them record low approval ratings,"" Rep. Steve Israel of New York who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Rogers became a key figure in developing U.S. national security policy, informed by his experience as an Army officer and FBI special agent. U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8 .

""He never once let partisan politics stand in the way of doing what's right for our nation and its safety. I can't think of anyone who enjoys more respect from both Republicans and Democrats alike."" Before Rogers became chairman, he issued an Intelligence Committee report ""on Iran's nuclear ambitions, authored a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,"" his Intelligence Committee biography said. ""Mike Rogers is as solid as they come -- one of those patriots willing to go to the wall to keep the American people safe, no matter the strain or sacrifice,"" Boehner said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Investors who say they were duped by a financier involved in a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme can proceed with their lawsuits, after the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in their favor. The 7-2 decision is a further legal setback for Texas financier Allen Stanford and his business associates over the sale of about $7 billion in certificates of deposit. Allen was sentenced to 110 years in prison in June 2012 for orchestrating the $7 billion fraud, one of the largest in U.S. history. At issue was whether the federal Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 precluded any class-action lawsuits in state courts, alleging a misrepresentation. Former investors seeking to recover losses are suing insurance brokers, financial services companies and law firms associated with Stanford. The court majority said its opinion will not hamper the federal government's ability to go after financial fraud in its separate criminal prosecutions. The consolidated cases are Chadborne & Parke LLP v. Troice (12-79); Willis of Colorado, Inc. v. Troice (12-86); and Proskauer Rose LLP v. Troice (12-88).","Case involves Texas financier Allen Stanford, convicted in a $7 billion Ponzi scheme .

"(CNN) -- For me, Chinese New Year used to be fun. When I was a kid, I was excited during Chinese New Year when I got lai see and I could stay up late. I even had access to candy, a once-a-year treat while living under the roof of my Tiger Mom. Riding strong on the sugar highs, I always thought to myself, this is what it must feel like to be an adult. I was flush, free and giddy. Then at some point in my twenties, Chinese New Year became a chore. Not any garden variety chore, but a cold-sweat-inducing family obligation that I try hard to avoid. As an adult, Chinese New Year is an annual nightmare, for the following reasons: . 1. I find it sucks when you are single . Relatives feel that they have a right to judge you because you do share bits of DNA, so, really, it's almost like they're judging themselves. Typically, the extended family gathers for Chinese New Year and spends an inordinate amount of time together, during which people get bored and focus their restlessness on judging the younger generation, particularly those who are single. Singledom means a lack of responsibilities and responsibility-free people need to be reined in by the wisdom of elders, or they will be reckless with their directionless lives. Here are some unavoidable conversations at Chinese New Year. By ""conversations"" I really mean monologues by one Wise Elder or another, fired away at a particular Single Younger in a trance-like manner: . ""Why don't you have a boyfriend? If you have a boyfriend, why don't you get married?"" ""Why are you not dieting at least a little bit? Second Cousin Yong Yong will have to start bringing clothes from America for you."" ""What happened to your hair? Blue is not such a good color for us Chinese people."" ""Are you saving up for an apartment? Why not? The most important thing in life is to have a roof over your head. You don't want to be homeless, do you? What if the economy collapses again? At least you will have an apartment."" ""Why don't you get a better paid job? You are wasting your talent. You will regret your life."" 2. I am employed . I loved the great Chinese tradition of gifting lai see. Getting HK$20 for no reason other than tradition really rocked my seven-year-old world. I have an income now, so twenty bucks here and there doesn't make a huge difference, but I still retain that childhood anticipation for the red packets. It's just a bit disappointing when I open up an envelope and it isn't concealing a massive check. And it's the guilt from feeling disappointed that makes me really hate Chinese New Year for making me hate myself. It's just like being unable to conceal your letdown expression when unwrapping that pair of socks at Secret Santa parties. Gifting is a heartwarming tradition. It's the thought that counts. I am not supposed to care. I am a bad person. There's even worse. Chinese New Year gambling is just out of hand. Now that I have a job, I'm expected to bet real money at The Mahjong Table, a no man's land filled with hidden agendas, treacherous scheming and Janus-faced traitors. If you beat your elder relatives at mahjong one too many times, beware their wrath. It really hurts when you get hit by a mahjong tile. If you lose on purpose to your elders and are unable to skillfully conceal your purposefulness, you risk looking patronizing. It will put them in a bad mood and lead to a vengeful ""what are you doing with your life"" interrogation later. See point number one. If you're simply crap at the game, you lose a load of money and will probably be judged for being not very intelligent. See point number one again. 3. I like good food . When foreigners make jokes about Chinese eating weird foods, I cringe. When Chinese New Year comes around, I'm the one making the damn jokes. At this time of year, we do get some incredible festive dishes. And then there are those odd ones that make you feel like the taste, texture and nutritional content of food have all become irrelevant -- we only eat for superstitions. Lots of Chinese New Year foods are auspicious in meaning, but atrocious in taste. I propose that we at least get rid of these three that are now out of touch with our lives: . Chinese New Year cake . Called ""leen go"" in Cantonese (""niangao"" in mainland China), the name sounds auspicious and means ""to progress more and reach higher every year."" The cake is made from glutionous rice, sugar and flavored with red bean paste or jujubes. Cut into thin slices, dip into beaten eggs and pan fry until it's gooey on the inside and crisp on the outside. The problem is, no one makes these at home anymore and the store-bought version is bland and stodgy, like eating slices of caulking. Since glutinous rice is considered difficult to digest for the elderly, us Single Youngers who have nothing to lose are forced to finish the plateful. Sugared lotus seeds . Back in the day -- before globalization brought us jelly beans and Sugus, before the invention of Coca-Cola, before Christopher Columbus brought cocoa beans to the Old World -- eating sugar-coated lotus seeds during Chinese New Year seemed like a good idea. Today, we have so many more delicious ways to feed our sweet tooth, so why do people still buy sugared lotus seeds? They look like mothballs, taste one dimensional and feel like a marble of sand broken upon the tongue. The name ""leen tsi"" sounds like ""to birth sons each year."" No one in the family likes to eat them and most of them already have kids, which means us Single Youngers have to swallow. Gok tsai . These are deep-fried sweet dumplings.

"(CNN) -- The growing number of foreign websites that offer counterfeit or stolen goods continues to threaten American technology, products and jobs. Illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion and thousands of jobs every year. Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while some of America's most profitable and productive industries are under attack. Internet protest stalls online piracy bills in Congress . The Stop Online Piracy Act protects consumers and innovators by targeting foreign websites that traffic in stolen or counterfeit products, everything from movies to medicine to baby food. A great deal of misinformation about the bill has been spread around the Internet. This information does a disservice to consumers, and it is being disseminated by those who have profited from working with illegal websites that steal and sell America's intellectual property. For instance, Google -- a major opponent of the bill -- paid $500 million to settle a criminal investigation for promoting foreign illegal online pharmacies, possibly endangering Americans' health. So their claims that SOPA will ""censor"" the Internet are self-serving. The online blackout that occurred this week, which included Wikipedia, was also misleading. Wikipedia has nothing to fear from SOPA. It is ironic that a website dedicated to providing information knowingly offered misinformation about the bill. SOPA will not harm Wikipedia, domestic blogs or social networking sites. Opinion: Why SOPA still needs work . Hyperbole has been rampant in the debate about SOPA. However, the bill in no way censors the Internet. It only targets activity that is already illegal, and only targets foreign websites that are dedicated to illegal or infringing activity. In fact, it is similar to laws that already govern websites based in the U.S. What has not been publicized is the broad support for SOPA. It has been endorsed by a diverse group of organizations, including the National Association of Manufacturers, International Union of Police Associations, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Songwriters Association and the National Center for Victims of Crime. The bill has even united strange bedfellows: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. It's not every day that you see business and labor on the same side of an issue. Even the White House has weighed in, endorsing the need for legislation to combat online piracy that protects free speech, the Internet and America's intellectual property. Like the White House, I oppose the censorship of legal activity on the Internet. I respect the First Amendment and believe that any legislation passed by Congress must protect and defend our constitutional rights. But illegal and criminal activity is not protected by the First Amendment simply because it takes place online. For example, there is no First Amendment right to view, distribute or download child pornography over the Internet. Like child pornography, the theft of intellectual property is also illegal in the United States. The Stop Online Piracy Act works by cutting off the money to foreign illegal sites and making it harder for online criminals to market and distribute illegal products to U.S. consumers. The bill includes provisions that ""follow the money"" to cut off the main sources of revenue to these sites, and also protects consumers from being directed to foreign illegal websites by search engines. And it provides innovators with a way to bring claims against foreign illegal sites that steal and sell their technology, inventions and products. Opinion: Online piracy laws must preserve Web freedom . I realize some people are nervous because of the misinformation surrounding this bill, but I am confident that ultimately the facts will overcome fears. I am open to constructive suggestions that protect American inventors and intellectual property rights holders. Unfortunately, some critics simply want to maintain the status quo that harms U.S. companies, consumers and innovators. We will continue to work with members of Congress, outside organizations and stakeholders to reach consensus and produce strong legislation that protects American innovators and jobs.

"(CNN) -- Before you're outraged at yet another story on Maria Kang, the mom who sparked outrage with her scantily clad ""What's your excuse?"" photo, or Caroline Berg Eriksen, the fitness blogger who created a firestorm after posting a shot that she claimed was just four days after giving birth, hear me out. This is not a story about them, why they did what they did, whether they are ""fat-shaming"" by posting the photos or how on Earth they have time to look like that as moms. No, this is not about them: It's about us. Why do those post-pregnancy fitness selfies and photos get under our skin so much? And if they make us so upset, why do we keep looking at them? Kang's Facebook photo, where she shows off her washboard stomach alongside her three toddlers, has been seen more than 16 million times. ""I think it makes us crazy because you are either one of two people: You either have the resources and ability and time to work your booty off all through pregnancy and immediately afterward in order to have that body, or you're genetically blessed, and not many of us fall into those two camps,"" said Stephanie Dulli, a Washington mom of two young boys and founder of the blog Stephanie Says. Dulli, who battled an eating disorder when she was younger, said part of the frustration comes from having to no longer just compete with the models and actresses who seem to bounce back immediately after giving birth. Now there's also pressure from other moms on social media. ""It taps into a really seventh-grade place in us where we feel bad about ourselves,"" Dulli said with a chuckle, remembering what she described as the ""You're pretty, so I'm ugly,"" mentality of middle school. ""It can just be hard to take, but I think it says more about me when I get upset about it than it does the person who posted the picture."" Claire Mysko, spokeswoman for the National Eating Disorders Association, says the vitriolic online response to these post-pregnancy photos stems from women who ""have had it up to here with this post-baby body reveal business."" ""I don't think it's helpful to shame individuals who post pictures of themselves ... but I understand the frustration, and I think it's coming from this post-baby body fatigue,"" said Mysko, co-author of the book ""Does this Pregnancy Make Me Look Fat?"" ""We're just really hit over the head with this message constantly that (losing weight) should be our priority as new mothers, and it's a really, really skewed way of looking at things."" 'Pregorexia': Extreme dieting while pregnant . Maggie Baumann suffered from an extreme obsession with weight during her second pregnancy, battling what's become known as ""pregorexia."" She worries about the messages these photos might be sending to women and girls. ""It's not just moms looking at these pictures,"" said Baumann, of Newport Beach, California, who is now an eating disorder specialist and trauma therapist. ""There are teens looking at these pictures thinking, 'OK, this is how I'm supposed to look after I have a baby.' ... It can start eating disorders."" Baumann says ""99.99%"" of women who give birth won't look like Berg Eriksen four days later, but a good chunk of those same women can't stop themselves from comparing their body with hers. ""We automatically compare,"" Baumann said. ""When you see pictures like this, it's kind of like, 'So what's wrong with me? Why can't I do that?' "" The Pregnancy Hunger Games . Radio host and television personality Jenny Hutt, co-host of HLN's ""Dr. Drew On Call,"" said the driving force for the upset is our own insecurities. ""It is the same insecurity that makes us look at other people's Facebook pages and wonder if our lives aren't measuring up,"" Hutt said. ""We compare because the people who look thinner, more gorgeous, happier, better engaged in their relationships ... highlight our own feelings of less-than."" Why can't we turn away? If these post-pregnancy photos ultimately make us feel worse about ourselves, why don't we try to avoid them in the first place? Instead of turning away from them, we seem to click on them, share them and comment on them. ""It's culturally ingrained in us that our worth is graded by our beauty,"" Dulli said. ""The first thing that's said to us is 'Aren't you cute? Aren't you pretty?' "" When we get older, logically we realize that we are about more than our looks, Dulli said, although she concedes it's so easy to fall back into bad habits. IReport: The girl in the mirror is my enemy . ""It still can tap a chord in you. ... It floods the system, almost, and you can't think logically. You react emotionally, and I'm guilty of that as well."" Mysko said it's especially hard for women to shut out the images because they're ""in our faces all of the time."" When or if the images start to make women ask themselves the question, ""What's wrong with me? Because I don't look like that,"" Mysko recommends some mental refocusing. ""It's just constantly repeating to yourself, 'No, it's not me. It's this message, and I need to not absorb this,' "" she said. Why can we be so mean? The backlash against Kang and Berg Eriksen was immediate and overwhelmingly negative from the start and is another example, in my humble opinion, of how nasty we women can be to each other. ""The biggest issue to me is the lack of honesty,"" said Hutt, the radio and television host and mom of two. ""If we own our own insecurities and doubts ... then maybe we will congratulate each other when there's an authentic win -- like a job promotion or a great (picture) in a bathing suit after giving birth, or even the win of the best body gene pool,"" she said. She added this nugget, which I love: If we focus on what makes us unique, maybe the ""instinct to be bitter about someone who has something (we) don't will dissipate."" Mysko says we can also do something else. The next time we're about to comment on someone's post-baby weight, we can shift the conversation. ""When you find yourself tempted to compliment somebody on how (they got) the baby weight off, just take a moment and stop yourself and think about what else you could ask about and something that might ... take it to a deeper level.""

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- One of the ships in a Gaza-bound flotilla blocked by Greece tried to flee on Monday and was stopped by the Greek Coast Guard. Greece called for the immediate arrest of the ship's captain, but organizers on the ship insisted they no longer had a captain. In a tweet, organizers said ""extreme damage"" was done to the Canadian ship, the Tahrir. ""When commandeered & towed by Greek Coast Guard it was slammed into a concrete wall,"" the tweet said, adding that the ship was ""taking on water."" They also tweeted that the travelers on board ""moved up on deck are in good spirits and are not leaving the boat."" Earlier in the day, the ship tweeted that it was ""casting off from Greece."" ""The Tahrir is leaving port in Crete, and we are breaking through Israel's Gaza blockade which now extends to Greek ports,"" organizer David Heap said in the statement. The ship's Twitter feed carried a tweet from a journalist on board, Jim Rankin, saying kayakers were blocking the Coast Guard, and the Canadian boat had left the harbor. Minutes later, the ship tweeted, ""We got about 5km (3.1 miles) away from shore. Greek authorities have taken over the boat and appear to be heading back to port."" Rankin tweeted that no one was injured in the Greek takeover of the boat, and delegates were ""non violent in blocking wheel house."" The Greek Coast Guard issued a statement saying, ""The Tahrir tried to leave the port of Agios Nikolaos in Crete without permission. The Coast Guard has intercepted the ship and it is now being taken back to the port. As a result the prosecutor's office has already asked for the immediate arrest of the captain. It is not clear if this will be extended to other passengers on board. There are an estimated 40 people aboard the ship."" But the ship tweeted, ""We left port without a captain. We released captain and crew from contract and sailed under control of international volunteers."" No further details were given. ""Our boat is surrounded by Greek police, tied up at port. Supporters from town are chanting, 'Free Gaza, Free Greece,' "" the ship tweeted. The Tahrir was brought to the port of Agios Nikolaos on the Greek island of Crete. The Tahrir is one of 10 ships trying to head to Gaza despite Israel's maritime blockade. Last week, the Greek Coast Guard intercepted a U.S. ship in the flotilla, the Audacity of Hope, about 10 minutes after it left Perama, triggering an hours-long standoff. The ship -- full of activists but no humanitarian aid -- was ultimately tied up at a Greek naval facility, and its captain, John Klusmire, was arrested. The Coast Guard said Klusmire had left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger. He will appear before Greek prosecutors on Tuesday. Greece's government offered Sunday to ship aid to Gaza -- a move the U.N. chief applauded but protest organizers and Palestinian authorities derided as insufficient. Greece's foreign ministry released a statement Sunday afternoon in which it proposed to ""undertake the task of transporting the humanitarian aid, with Greek vessels or other appropriate means, through existing channels."" Foreign Minister Stavros Lambrinidis talked by phone with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who thanked Greece and expressed support for the initiative, according to a U.N. statement. ""In his view, it could help to reduce tensions in the region and ensure much-needed aid is delivered to those who need it in Gaza,"" the U.N. statement said of Ban's views, adding the world body will ""work closely with Greece, Israel and Palestinian authorities on this matter."" But Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said Sunday that funneling food, cement and other goods via other means, such as Greek ships, missed the point, which he said is to ""immediately lift, not ease"" Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza. He lauded those behind the flotilla as people ""who have dedicated their time, effort and passion for a just cause."" Israel says its blockade is necessary to try to halt the shipment of weapons into Gaza. Militants in Gaza have launched numerous deadly attacks against Israelis. The territory is run by Hamas, which has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks and is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization. Israel also emphasizes that it delivers large amounts of aid to Gaza. The country has mounted a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail. The Israeli government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill Israeli military personnel should their boats be boarded. Israeli officials alleged that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on Israeli commandos. Flotilla organizer Medea Benjamin dismissed the allegations as ludicrous on June 28, saying, ""They see this nonviolent, ragtag group of ships as such a threat they're using their entire propaganda apparatus, and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists. It's pathetic."" The Middle East Quartet -- composed of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia -- issued a statement Saturday asking ""all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas, which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation."" The Quartet added that it ""strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of Gaza to do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings."" Doing so, the group contends, is the best way to both help Palestinians and address Israel's ""legitimate security concerns."" Erakat said that while Palestinian leaders ""support international engagement in lifting the unjust and inhumane Israeli blockade,"" the Quartet's statement and their opposition to the planned flotilla to Gaza skirt the broader challenges in the region. ""We invite them to focus on resolving the root cause of the conflict, which is the occupation, rather than seeking ways to manage its destructive symptoms."" Erakat said.

"(CNN) -- Russia has dropped charges of piracy against 30 Greenpeace activists who were arrested during a protest against Arctic drilling in September. However, they'll still be charged with hooliganism, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The original charge of piracy carried a sentence of up to 15 years. Greenpeace says the hooliganism charge is still ""wildly disproportionate."" ""We will contest the trumped up charge of hooliganism as strongly as we contested the piracy allegations. They are both fantasy charges that bear no relation to reality,"" Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said in a statement. The so-called ""Arctic 30"" includes 28 activists and two freelance journalists. They were arrested in September after two activists left their ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and attempted to scale an oil platform owned by Russian energy company Gazprom in the Barents Sea. The Russian coast guard detained the pair and the rest of the crew, and towed the ship to the northwestern Russian port city of Murmansk. ""Those brave men and women went to the Arctic armed with nothing more than a desire to shine a light on a reckless business. They should be with their families, not in a prison in Murmansk,"" Chuprov added. Greenpeace said the two activists were trying to hang a banner from the side of the rig in what the group called a peaceful protest against the ""slow but unrelenting destruction of the Arctic."" But Russian authorities accuse them of trying to commandeer the platform. The authorities and Gazprom also say the activists endangered the lives of the company's employees and that their action could have led to an environmental disaster. Along with the hooliganism charges, the chief of Russia's Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said some members of the group could also be charged with using force against state officials, according to RIA Novosti. The defendants include Americans Peter Wilcox, who is the captain of the Arctic Sunrise, and Dmitry Litvinov, who Greenpeace says also holds Swedish citizenship. The other detainees are from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Britain, New Zealand, Ukraine, Russia, France, Italy, Turkey, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, the United States and Sweden, the group said.","Russia drops piracy charge, adds new charge of hooliganism .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Leaders of the NAACP on Saturday called for the firing of the New York Post cartoonist whose drawing lampooning the federal stimulus bill has drawn charges that it's racist and encourages violence toward President Obama. NAACP's Benjamin Todd Jealous says the  organization will take issue ""national"" if Post cartoonist isn't fired. Speaking at the civil rights group's annual meeting in New York, NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said that if Sean Delonas is not fired, the group will call for protests of the paper and Fox television affiliates, which are owned by Post parent company News Corp. ""There is consensus that if the Post does not ... get rid of the journalists who are responsible for this bit of hate speech seeing the light of day, that we will move this from a local, regional issue to a very national issue,"" Jealous said. The group also called for the cartoonist's editor to be fired. Many critics said the cartoon played on historically racist images by appearing to compare Obama, the nation's first black president, to a chimpanzee that had been shot by police officers. The cartoon references the mauling of a Connecticut woman by a chimpanzee who was later shot and killed by police. In its caption, one of the officers says, ""They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill."" Obama had signed the bill the day before the cartoon ran. On its Web site Thursday, the paper offered a qualified apology, saying it was ""most certainly not our intent"" to express racism, but also accusing some of jumping at a chance to attack a paper they already disliked.

""For the publication to suggest the only people who object to it are constant critics of the New York Post is beyond ridiculous.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The substance that spurred an evacuation at a California airport Tuesday was simply honey, the Kern County Sheriff's Department said. The security scare happened after Transportation Security Administration agents found what they believed to be a potentially hazardous substance inside a passenger's luggage. ""None of the items inside the bag contained explosive or hazardous material, and the liquid inside the five bottles was identified as honey,"" the sheriff's department said in a statement. The Meadows Field Airport had been evacuated and shut down for several hours Tuesday morning after authorities found what they called a hazardous substance. The man whose bag was flagged, told authorities that he had honey packaged in five bottles, Deputy Michael Whorf, spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff's Department told CNN. The 31-year-old man cooperated with authorities and was released with no charges against him, Whorf said. The trouble started when two TSA agents were doing a routine swab of the man's bag, which tested positive for a hazardous substance, Whorf said. The agents who discovered the substance opened the bag and both became nauseated, Whorf said. They were transported to the hospital and later released. The preliminary tests using the swabs indicated the presence of the explosives TNT and triacetone triperoxide, known as TATP, Whorf said. The man told authorities that he was on a flight from Bakersfield, California, where he had visited relatives, back to his home in Milwaukee, and was carrying the bottles of honey back with him. Flights in and out of Meadow Fields resumed Tuesday afternoon. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","NEW: Normal operations resume at Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just weeks after the failed car bombing of New York's Times Square, the Department of Homeland Security says ""the number and pace of attempted attacks against the United States over the past nine months have surpassed the number of attempts during any other previous one-year period."" That grim assessment is contained in an unclassified DHS intelligence memo prepared for various law enforcement groups, which says terror groups are expected to try attacks inside the United States with ""increased frequency."" CNN obtained a copy of the document, dated May 21, which goes on to warn, ""we have to operate under the premise that other operatives are in the country and could advance plotting with little or no warning."" The intelligence note says recent attempted terror attacks have used operatives and tactics which made the plots hard to detect. The document specifically mentions the cases of Afghan national Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty in February to plotting attacks on New York's subways, and Times Square bombing suspect Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-American. The intelligence report says both men spent significant time in the United States and were familiar with their alleged targets. Furthermore, the plots involved materials that can be commonly purchased in America without causing suspicion. The document also says Shahzad and Zazi had short periods of training overseas ""compared to lengthier training cycles for earlier operations, reducing our ability to detect their activities."" The report say U.S. officials ""lack insights in specific details, timing and intended targets,"" but trends indicate terrorists are looking for ""smaller, more achievable attacks against easily accessible targets."" The report mentions both al Qaeda and associated groups such as the Tehrik e-Taliban Pakistan, which is known as the TTP. The intelligence document also says terror groups increasingly are using westerners as operatives or in leadership positions in which they make public statements calling for Muslims to strike the United States. The document cites as examples Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Alawki and al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn. The report also mentions Omar Hammami, who grew up in Alabama and is now believed to be an operative with al-Shabaab in Somalia. Although al-Shabaab has not executed attacks in the United States, law enforcement officials have expressed concern that Somali-Americans who have gone to Somalia to train and fight could return to the United States and commit acts of terrorism.","DHS memo says number and pace of attempted attacks have surpassed ""any other previous one-year period""

"(CNN) -- I carry in my mind a picture of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the beginning of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march on March 21, 1965. What makes that picture so vivid to me 48 years later, as we prepare to celebrate his 84th birthday this month, is that voting rights issues I once imagined were over have resurfaced on a national scale. The biggest difference between then and now is that today's voter suppression operations are highly sophisticated, compared with the crude, racist ones conducted by Southern sheriffs and voter registrars through the middle 1960s. Before the 2012 elections, well-funded efforts in state after state tried to curtail the participation of poor and minority voters by introducing burdensome voter ID requirements, despite a record showing individual voter fraud is virtually nonexistent in the United States. A five-year, nationwide investigation into voter fraud by the George W. Bush administration resulted in just 86 convictions. At the end of the Selma to Montgomery march, King delivered one of his most memorable speeches before a crowd of 25,000 on the steps of the capitol. ""Our whole campaign in Alabama has been centered on the right to vote,"" he declared. ""We are on the move now, and no wave of racism can stop us."" The beginnings of the march, which came about after violent clashes that pitted Alabama police and state troopers against civil rights protesters and black Alabamans trying to get on the voter rolls, were more uncertain. By current demonstration standards, those of us gathered at Selma, a hard town to reach for anyone who didn't live nearby, were few -- 3,200 by most estimates. As he moved to the front of the line, King seemed eager to get started. He gave no indication he was worried about his own safety. When the march moved down U.S. Highway 80, he appeared unperturbed by the counterprotest that seemed jolting to me: a ""Coonsville USA"" sign, young kids carrying BB guns screaming ""white nigger."" King had, I realized, accepted such hatred as part of his lot in life. He could not know that by August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act would be signed into law by President Johnson. He could only hope the Selma march changed more minds than were in the rows of us walking behind him. The voter suppression efforts that were aimed at preventing President Obama from being re-elected in 2012 are a reminder that the decisive victory the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided can be undermined if we are not vigilant. The Supreme Court already has on its calendar a case, Shelby County v. Holder, that tests the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires state and local governments, primarily in the Deep South, with a history of discrimination to obtain ""pre-clearance"" from the Justice Department before making any changes affecting voting. Motivating the Republican politicians, who in recent years have sought to suppress voting with tighter ID requirements, is their fear that the demographic tide is running against them. We have come 180 degrees from 1968, when Kevin Phillips in his landmark political study of that election, ""The Emerging Republican Majority,"" noted that by virtue of capturing the loyalty of the anti-civil rights whites of the South along with a majority of voters from the nation's heartland, Republicans put themselves in a position to be the dominant party in the country after decades of Democratic rule. In 2012 the tide has shifted again. Despite taking 59% of the white vote, Mitt Romney could not win an election in which the votes of minorities and new immigrants make up such an important share of the electorate. Republicans, aware that their hostility to such issues as future citizenship for undocumented immigrants and affirmative action has put the majority of nonwhite voters beyond their reach, have sought to do what white Southerners did before 1965 -- erect voting barriers to preserve their power. The voting barriers that King and the civil rights movement battled in the 1960s had their historic origins in such 19th century measures as the Mississippi Plan of 1890, in which the state instituted the poll tax as well as the requirement that a voter be able to read or interpret any section of the new Mississippi State Constitution. The emphasis on photo IDs, which so many poor and minority voters lack because they do not own a car and cannot afford to fly, is a variation of this past Southern strategy, as Georgia's Democratic Rep. John Lewis, who was badly beaten at Selma during the ""Bloody Sunday"" protest of March 7, has pointed out. The rhetoric of the Old South and the present can even sound alike when it comes to voter registration. We need only compare Judge R. H. Thompson bragging about how the Mississippi State Constitution of 1890 preserved the white vote ""by Anglo-Saxon ingenuity"" and Pennsylvania GOP House majority leader Mike Turzai telling a Republican State Convention this June, ""Voter ID, which is going to allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done."" (That Pennsylvania law ran into trouble with a judge and voter IDs were not required in the November election.) It is easy to imagine King being dismayed by these historical regressive links, but it is hard to imagine him being moved to silence or inaction by them.

Across the country, even around the globe, they and other Americans in at least several hundred communities are expected to gather in coffeehouses to raise their mugs of java to something new. They're professionals, musicians and housewives. They're frustrated liberal activists, disheartened conservatives and political newborns. They're young and old, rich and poor, black, white and all shades of other. Born on Facebook just six weeks ago, the group boasts more than 110,000 fans, as of Friday morning. The Coffee Party is billed by many as an answer to the Tea Party (more than 1,000 fewer fans), a year-old protest movement that's steeped in fiscal conservatism and boiling-hot, anti-tax rhetoric. This new group calls for civility, objects to obstructionism and demands that politicians be held accountable to the people who put them in office. Are you at a Coffee Party gathering? Share your images, story . ""The government has become so broken that the will of the people has been lost in the political game,"" said Stacey Hopkins, 46, coordinator of the Atlanta, Georgia, chapter. ""And the only voices you're hearing are the ones of those who are screaming the loudest. They have a right to their views, but they don't have the right to speak for all Americans."" At a recent Coffee Party planning meeting at Manuel's Tavern, an Atlanta political institution, about 40 people gathered to speak for themselves. They brought their own stories of why they were there. The one who was ""never active in this stuff"" Politics? It never spoke to John Purser, who's preferred the simple life. At 69, he lives in a two-room house on a rural dirt road in Carroll County, drives a 26-year-old Ford pickup and takes odd jobs to get by. He cuts grass, chops wood and does handyman work. Earlier this week, he freed a bird from someone's house and ""got paid with a bottle of whiskey,"" he said with a laugh. He doesn't need much. Never has. But Purser, who worked in maintenance for Delta Airlines for 30 years, has seen the little security he might have had -- his retirement money, for example, and his home's value -- fall apart in recent years. And he just doesn't understand why some fancy executive should earn millions. His own daddy made $12 a week building roads for the Work Projects Administration during the Great Depression. ""Our country was a hell of a lot worse off then, and we came together, and we did something,"" he said. ""I'm not that smart. I don't know the dollars and cents. But I'm just looking for something different."" The Atlanta coordinator . Hopkins was 5 when she stared at the two water fountains: one marked ""colored,"" the other ""white."" The New Yorker was somewhere in Virginia at a train stop with her mother and grandmother, and, well, she'd never drunk colored water before and figured white was what she wanted. But her grandmother yanked her away from that water, muttering something about her getting them all killed. That moment, and her childlike understanding of what it meant, stuck with Hopkins and has driven  her ever since. The stay-at-home mom used to work in the real-estate mortgage field but left when she became disheartened by the industry. She feels hopeful about the people who are re-engaging in and taking ownership of the political process. ""President Obama is stifled by a dysfunctional Congress. When he was on the campaign trail, he used the word 'we' a lot. He cannot do this alone. He needs our help,"" she said. ""Americans are waking up across the board. ... Not everyone is cut out to be an activist. But everyone can do something."" The young fiscal conservative . When other kids were watching cartoons, Alex Oxford tuned in to news programs. For as long as the Marietta, Georgia, high school senior can remember, he's been drawn to politics. He's 17 and can't vote, but he's long volunteered for campaigns. The self-described libertarian and fiscal conservative was, and in some ways still is, a supporter of the Tea Party. He initially backed Sen. John McCain for president in 2008 and isn't, himself, comfortable with the idea of a public option in the health-care system. But the direction Oxford has seen the Tea Party take recently has him concerned. He can't help but think it's being hijacked by social conservatives and the far right, he said, and as a gay man who's committed to gay rights, it may not be his cup of political tea. So he's pulled up a chair at the Coffee Party to see what it can offer. Next to him is a college Democrat leader wearing a T-shirt that reads: ""I'll hug your [picture of an elephant] if you kiss my [picture of a donkey]."" ""I never feel uncomfortable stating my opinions,"" but it was ""sort of ironic. They wanted free discussion of the issues but didn't want to talk about the conservative side of things,"" Oxford said after the planning meeting. ""I think it was great, but I'd like to see more conservatives and libertarians."" The disillusioned Obama supporter . ""As a Southern woman, I was taught that discussing politics and religion is ill-mannered,"" said Darlene Jones-Owens, 53, of Carrollton, Georgia. But she became an involved and vocal Democrat when she ""realized that America had been lied to about Iraq, that our military uses torture, and when I heard John McCain sing 'Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran.' "" She said she began registering voters for the Democratic Party, canvassed her neighborhood to talk about issues that had become dear to her and endured ""icy stares and insults."" Unable to find Obama bumper stickers and other materials where she lives, the University of West Georgia lecturer and a friend ordered them in bulk and made sure others had access to them. ""I am looking for a group of informed thinkers who might be able to impact the obstructionism we now have in D.C.,"" she said. ""I've gotten really disillusioned with the lack of change that's happened. ... There are a lot of people looking for something different. We have a lot more in common than we realize."" The man Aunt Rosa called ""baby"" Tony Anderson likes to say he was born into an organization. He has a twin brother and learned early on what it meant to work with others. Through church involvement and his family, the Detroit, Michigan, native gleaned more. His great-grandmother's first cousin was the legendary civil rights activist Rosa Parks, whom he grew up calling ""Aunt Rosa."" He remembers her telling him, "" 'You know, baby, you're not special. You're unique,' "" and that's a distinction he appreciates today. To be special means you deserve more, your own category; everyone, on the other hand, is unique and has something to offer. The 27-year-old social entrepreneur and nonprofit consultant works in sustainability. While a political philosophy major at Morehouse College in Atlanta, he started the Let's Raise a Million Project, which set out to bring low-income black communities into the green movement one compact fluorescent light bulb at a time. He calls himself a ""political realist"" who never expects change to happen in a flash. He didn't put that on Obama, and he looks at the Coffee Party with cautious optimism. ""I think that space is definitely onto something,"" he said. It's ""another way to start a conversation. That's what I really like.""","Freshly brewed Coffee Party Movement kicks off with global gathering Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Suicide bombers are responsible for killing more than 12,000 Iraqi civilians and wounding more than 30,000 since the war began, according to study released by the British medical journal Lancet. The study found that 1,003 documented suicide bombings accounted for 12,284 of 108,624 Iraqi civilian deaths, 11% of those killed between March 20, 2003, and December 31, 2010. It also found such attacks accounted for 30,644 -- or 26% -- of the 117,165 documented cases of Iraqi civilians wounded within the same period. ""Suicide bombers in Iraq use suicide bombs strategically as cost-effective, precise, highly destructive weapons,"" said the study, which was published Saturday. ""Our findings suggest that the Iraqi civilian population suffers a substantial public health burden because it is a primary chosen target of suicide bombers and those who deploy them."" The study analyzed and compared suicide bomb casualties using data compiled by Iraq Body Count, an independent public database that documents violent Iraqi deaths using hospital, morgue, nongovernmental organizations and official figures as well as media reports. ""Certainly, our findings for documented casualties do not represent total deaths or injuries, because not every death or injury is reported, or linked to a suicide bombing as a cause,"" the study said. Getting an accurate picture of the Iraq war toll is difficult at best. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein saw the collapse of Iraq's government, including the agencies responsible for documenting deaths. Additionally, insurgent violence made hand counts by health care workers and nongovernment organizations impossible. Iraq Body Count has been criticized by a number of people, including those who say its data is biased, undercounted or overcounted. Proponents of the organization's data, which is published at iCasualties.org, say it is the most reliable tally of Iraqi deaths. The Lancet also faced criticism for publishing a study in 2006 that found 600,000 Iraqi civilians had been killed during the war. The authors' findings were widely dismissed. The latest study, which was written by Madelyn Hsiao-Rei Hicks of King's College of London, also documented the number of U.S.-led coalition forces killed in suicide bomb attacks. During the same period from 2003 to 2010, 79 documented suicide bomb attacks were responsible for the deaths of 200 coalition troops, the study found. Of those troops killed, 176 were American, it said. The U.S. military said no American troops were killed in Iraq in August, marking the first month without a military casualty since the invasion. But for Iraqis, August was one of the more deadly months of the year. On August 15, the country was struck by a barrage of suicide bombings, car bombs and gunfights that left 84 people dead and 200 wounded. Two weeks later, at least 28 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a Sunni mosque in western Baghdad, officials said.","NEW: Suicide bomb attacks continue in Iraq, while no U.S. fatalities reported in August .

"(CNN) -- For the past few weeks my email box has been slowly, inexorably, filling up with Davos invites. A seminar here, a reception there, a late nightcap thrown in. Everyone, it seems, has an event -- and they want you to attend. There are the governments bringing along their hot-shot ministers, with whom you can schmooze over canapes; the consulting groups holding parties to reveal their latest surveys; the NGOs seeking attention and coverage for their causes; the companies screaming ""we're here, come and meet our CEO!"" Like opportunistic birds pecking juicy flies from the head of a wallowing hippo, they are feeding on the WEF's ability to attract the world's biggest political, economic and corporate players. Governments meet corporations; corporations meet clients; the press meets everyone. All have a story to tell and an agenda to sell. Allow me to give you a taste of some of this year's events: one company has invited me to a ""thought provoking breakfast discussion on the future of human capital"" (dress code: Business casual; funny - I was going to wear my ski gear); another is offering a session on ""re-defining success in a digital age."" Doesn't salary count anymore? Then of course there is the need to have a USP. One consulting group has tied its Davos invite to a photography exhibition: ""Game changing -- now is the time!"" Everyone wants to be seen to be game changing. There are some obvious winners. The Sochi Nightcap, sponsored by Coke and the Russians, will celebrate the two week countdown to the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Since it's late -- from 10 'til midnight - and also sponsored by Russian business, I predict with confidence that this will be both full and very lively. Then of course there are the hardy perennials, such as PWC with its Global CEO Survey launch, featuring cocktails. There are some events that you just don't miss (if, that is, you are lucky enough to be invited). The informal closed breakfast session with Shimon Peres is always a fascinating chance to hear the 91-year-old president of Israel speak with prescience on world issues. It alone is worth the trip to Davos. Everyone from Martin Sorrell's WPP to the government of South Africa wants a bit of your time during the Davos week. And all of this is on top of the 88 pages of official panels, seminars and discussions. Crucially, invitations are always described as ""individual and non-transferable"" as if there are hordes of interlopers waiting to freeload. To guarantee your place it is not enough to simply be a Davos attendee, you need to be invited to each specific event too. Davos is probably the world's most elite society, but it dresses itself up as a non-elite event. Don't be fooled. You must wear a specially coloured badge, which shrieks your status to others. There are events to which you may be granted admission or be barred from joining. Even the hotel that you are allocated speaks volumes (please WEF, some will beg, don't put me in Klosters this year... pretty please!). But there is one meeting place for everyone at Davos, where status goes out of the window, and who you are matters less than if you can pay for the ridiculously priced drinks: the Piano Bar. Late, very late at night, they pack them in with bone crushing disregard for comfort. Everyone from interns and volunteers, to CEOs and government leaders - the lot. Drunken singing and high jinks ensue. This is a truly Swiss experience because the Piano Bar is neutral territory. It doesn't matter how you got to Davos, or why you are there; once you're in the Piano Bar all that matters is that you drink, sing and make merry. Then the early hour arrives, and the chance for a couple of hours' sleep, before it's time to attend that morning breakfast discussion, redefining something or other. You will only wish you could remember what. Read more: . All you need to know to be a Davos delegate .

"(CNN) -- Yemen's largest opposition coalition blamed President Ali Abdullah Saleh's ruling family for causing chaos in the town of Radda, Baitha province, and said the family intentionally eased the way for al Qaeda militants to take over the town. The Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) said this strategy was used in an effort to delay the presidential elections and halt the power transfer from taking place. ""Only Saleh would hand over a town to terrorists. He does not care for Yemen or its people,"" said Ahmed Bahri, a senior JMP leader. Numerous tribal chiefs told CNN that the suspected al Qaeda militants are now in control of the Sawadia Republican Guard's base in Radda and entered the town without a fight. Saleh's eldest son, Ahmed, runs the guards. ""Everything was handed over to the militants. What other explanation can there be? Hundreds of Republican Guard forces suddenly evacuated the base without a fight,"" said Abdullah al-Barraki, a tribal chief in Radda. CNN was able to independently verify that the militants were now in control of the base. Radda, located just 107 miles southeast of Yemen's capital Sana'a, has been without any security presence for more than six days, according to residents. Tribal chiefs in the town are negotiating with the militants to leave the town without bloodshed. This comes as thousands of anti-Saleh protesters marched in the streets of Radda on Wednesday, condemning what they say was an act of treachery by relatives of Saleh. ""Saleh's nephew and son handed over the town to the militants. They wanted al Qaeda to take over the town to raise the tension in the country,"" said Sameer Ashtal, a youth protester in Radda. He added, ""Saleh is willing to destroy to the entire country for the sake of himself, and that is why he has to leave power."" Marchers in Radda chanted, ""Saleh's family sold Radda. He will stand trial for this crime."" Last week, dozens of militants loyal to Tareq al-Thahab, an extremist militant, took over historical sites in Radda and called for the implementation of Sharia law. Khaled al-Thahab, a prominent tribal leader and brother of the al Qaeda leader in Radda, said that the National Security Forces assisted his brother in taking over the town. The national security sector is directly run by Ammar Mohammed, the nephew of Saleh. The JMP warned the international community that certain factions will be seeking to halt the power transfer deal worked out with the Gulf Cooperation Council. ""The JMP are completely abiding (by) the GCC power transfer deal while Saleh's ruling family is doing otherwise,"" said Mohammed Qahtan, a senior opposition Islah official, and former spokesperson for the JMP. CNN contacted the office of Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to clarify the reasons behind the growing tension, but they refused to comment. Saleh signed away executive powers to Hadi on November 23, allowing him to keep the title of president for 90 days but officially ending his rule. Hadi is expected to win the February 21 presidential elections and be the country's next leader. Jamal Ben Omar, the United Nations envoy to Yemen, insists that presidential elections will not be delayed. ""There is no space to negotiate the delay of the Yemeni presidential elections,"" he said. Ali al-Amrani, Yemen's minister of information, told CNN that an immunity bill for Saleh is expected to be passed on Saturday after differing factions met at Hadi's residence on Wednesday and finalized most differing points. The bill has been the core of controversy between the opposition and the president. The bill, if passed, will grant Saleh immunity from prosecution for all crimes and violations committed during his 33 years in power.","JMP: Saleh's family has handed town of Radda over to al Qaeda militants .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government had pledged an array of support from monetary aid to search-and-rescue missions in the Philippines, helping its longtime ally recover from a massive, devastating typhoon. The U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, announced Saturday it is immediately making available $100,000 to go for health care, clean water and sanitation to areas hit hard by the devastating storm. This initial grant follows a disaster declaration by Acting U.S. Ambassador Brian Goldbeck, as the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines notes on its website. USAID said in a statement that it is sending a disaster assistance response team to assess the damage, determine the humanitarian needs and keep key players posted on what's happening and what needs to happen next. 'Worse than hell' The group is working in coordination with the Philippines' government -- which requested the assistance -- as well as international and non-governmental organizations plus other U.S. agencies, such as the Department of Defense. The American Embassy noted that Washington will also fly a humanitarian assistance survey team to Manila due to the catastrophe. The U.S. military announced that Secretary Chuck Hagel has directed troops to support these humanitarian missions. That includes deploying aircraft for search-and-rescue missions, bringing in aid and providing logistical support. Leaders, celebrities send messages . The U.S. force will be led by Marines out of Okinawa, Japan, according to two U.S. military officials. Other military services will participate. There is currently a Marine Expeditionary Unit of about 2,000 Marines on several ships in the Pacific, as well as a supply ship that could be sent. Both officials emphasized the plan is still being finalized. As of now, the plan is for the U.S. military to fly in requested aid by transport aircraft and heavy-lift helicopters into the most damaged areas. In hard-hit Tacloban, children ripped from arms . ""In coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. ambassador in Manila, the Department of Defense will continue to monitor the effects of Typhoon Haiyan and stands ready to help our ally recover from the storm,"" the Pentagon said in a statement. Much of this support will be directed to the same place -- including hard-hit places like Palo and Tacloban -- where, just under 70 years ago, U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur led allied troops back to then battle-scarred Philippines. Water, wind and fire create catastrophe .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Democratic White House hopeful Sen. Barack Obama told CNN on Tuesday his early opposition to the Iraq war proves he has the judgment to lead the country out of the conflict. The Illinois Democrat also said polls show that voters think rival Sen. Hillary Clinton would be better at ending the war because the New York Democrat has blurred the distinctions between the two candidates. ""Everybody had difficult choices to make, and these were difficult choices. I made the right choice, and I think that's relevant not to the past, but to the future,"" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley of his decision as an Illinois state senator to come out against the war in 2002. In a speech at that time, five months before the U.S. invaded Iraq, Obama said publicly that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ""poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighbors,"" that he could be contained, and that ""even a successful war against Iraq will require U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences."" Obama added that such a war would ""strengthen the recruitment arm of al Qaeda."" On Tuesday, in a speech in Chicago, Obama reflected on his early opposition. ""In this campaign, we've seen who has the leadership to lead the country during difficult times -- I did not only oppose the war but laid out reasons that turned out to be prescient over time, and I think that says something about my judgment,"" he said. Obama questioned the judgment of lawmakers who voted to authorize the war -- which includes his two top rivals for the Democratic nomination, Clinton and former Sen. John Edwards.  Watch Obama call Iraq 'one big mistake.' » . ""This was a vote about whether or not to go to war,"" the Democratic presidential candidate said. ""That's the truth as we all understood it then, and as we need to understand it now. And we need to ask those who voted for the war: How can you give the president a blank check and then act surprised when he cashes it?"" Of the Democratic presidential candidates who served in Congress during the October 2002 vote to authorize force in Iraq, only Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich voted no. In addition to Clinton and Edwards, Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Joe Biden of Delaware voted for the authorization. Asked why his early opposition isn't resonating with more Democratic primary voters, Obama said Clinton has been successful in obscuring the differences between their two records on this issue. ""It's our job to make these distinctions clear to the American people, because it really ends up speaking to how we're going to make decisions in the future and how we're going to make decisions about a series of significant threats and how we are going to make decisions about getting out of Iraq."" Obama also said he is not discouraged by recent polls that indicate he significantly trails Clinton, saying Americans are just beginning to pay attention to the race. ""You know, I recognize that there has been a sense that this campaign has been lasting in perpetuity, but the American people are just starting to focus,"" he said. ""We just went up for the first time in New Hampshire on television. We've got three months of campaigning before the first Iowa caucus, and then we've got a number of primaries and caucuses after that. So we feel very comfortable with the pace that we're on.""

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Three days after at least 108 passengers -- most of them Congolese refugees -- died when their overloaded boat capsized on Lake Albert, the Ugandan government wants to find a safe way to send the survivors home. ""To avoid more accidents due (to) violations of safety rules, we are stepping up efforts to ensure orderly repatriation of refugees wishing to return to their countries,"" said Hillary Onek, Uganda minister for relief, disaster preparedness and refugees. Officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United Nations refugee agency will meet April 14 to work out details for the refugees' return, he said. At least 45 people were rescued. Meanwhile, police were continuing Tuesday to scour the waters for more bodies, though there was little expectation that further survivors would be found. Overloaded boats are a common cause of death on Lake Albert and across the lakes of the Albertine Rift region. Ugandan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said Saturday that the refugees had left from the Kyangwali settlement camp in Hoima district. ""They were leaving the camp to get back to their country, and it is the cheapest transport for them,"" he said. Over the past decade, rebellions against the Joseph Kabila-led administration had led tens of thousands of people to flee to Uganda, where about half of the nearly 400,000 refugees are Congolese. The capsizing occurred as the boat was returning to DRC after U.N. forces there had dislodged a number of rebel groups from Ituri, an interim province in northeastern DRC. Saturday's victims were among an increasing number of refugees who, in response to assurances from cultural leaders and humanitarian agencies that they would be safe, have chosen to return, according to officials from Uganda, DRC and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""The accident was as a result of one of (those) spontaneous returns,"" Onek said. ""It is in response to campaigns, mainly by King Bamukoka Swambili Kamango of the Batalinga tribe in eastern DRC, calling on his subjects to return home because peace had been returned"" to their country of origin. The king had said that humanitarian agencies were poised to provide the returnees with settlement help, Onek said. ""In the meantime, we are sensitizing the Congolese refugees about the dangers of escaping from settlements without notifying their host authorities,"" he added. Most of the bodies have been claimed by relatives and taken to DRC for burial; those unclaimed will be buried in marked areas for future claimants, Onek said.","""We are stepping up efforts to ensure orderly repatriation of refugees,"" says Ugandan minister .

"NAUDERO, Pakistan (CNN) -- Dramatic new videotape of the assassination of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto emerged Sunday, showing her slumping just after gunshots ring out. In a video released Sunday, Benazir Bhutto, far right, appears through the sunroof before shots ring out. The tape provides the clearest view yet of the attack and appears to show that Bhutto was shot. That would contradict the Pakistan government's account. A previously released videotape shows a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun, pointing it toward Bhutto, who is standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof. He fires three shots. Then, there is an explosion. In the latest video Bhutto is standing, and her hair and scarf appear to move, perhaps from the bullet. Bhutto falls into the car. Then, the blast.  Watch tapes showing apparent gunman » . These images seem to support the theory that Bhutto died at the hands of a shooter before a bomb was detonated, killing another 23 people. Everyone inside Bhutto's bomb-proof car lived. Those traveling with her say they saw her bleeding, and the heavily blood-stained interior appears to support their accounts.  See the likely sequence of events » . The doctor who initially examined the body said Bhutto died of bullet wounds. However, the Pakistani government later said she died from shrapnel wounds from the explosion. And, in a move that caused more confusion, the government released X-rays of Bhutto's skull and said they show she died when the force of the explosion caused her head to slam into a metal lever on the sunroof. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, disputed the government's account. ""I can say confidently that she was shot,"" he said. He called the government's explanation ""a useless excuse, because they have to divert attention from the main subject""  -- who is responsible for the killing. Zardari also said Sunday he will serve as co-chairman of the Pakistan People's Party while their 19-year-old son, Bilawal, and newly named heir to the party leadership, finishes his studies. ""He will, of course, be kept aware of all that is happening with the party,"" Zardari told CNN sister network CNN-IBN. ""I will be looking after the interests of the party, as a guide, as a helper, and as a friend to the party, and as a part-time leader to the party."" Once the political science student at Oxford University has been properly groomed, ""then I can go and play golf,"" Zardari said, without specifying how long he thought the process would take. Zardari acknowledged that his wife stipulated in her will that he was to step into her role in the event of her death. But Zardari said his decision to pass that role to their son is correct. ""I, in my political wisdom, think we need a larger symbol than myself to keep the party united with her gone,"" he said. ""Because she could have probably not even herself imagined the reaction that her death would do to Pakistan."" He said Bhutto's assassination on Thursday has thrust Pakistan onto the verge of disintegration. But Zardari said the parliamentary elections slated to be held January 8, less than two weeks after his wife's death, should not be postponed. ""Our demand is elections on time -- free, fair as promised,"" he said. He called on opposition leader Nawaz Sharif -- who heads the Pakistan Muslim League-N party -- to also take part in the vote. Sharif has previously said he would boycott the election. But sources within the Pakistan Muslim League-N party say they will stand with the PPP and take part in the election. Speaking on Pakistan's GEO-TV, Sharif said an official announcement on the party's decision would take place Monday. President Pervez Musharraf's ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q, the election commission and the interim Cabinet will hold separate meetings in the coming days to discuss the possibility of a delayed vote. Zardari said he does not trust the government led by Musharraf to ensure the elections are indeed free and fair, but he does believe the people of Pakistan will be able to ensure that happens. Whether his other two children will decide to enter politics ""is entirely up to them,"" he said. ""You know children today. You cannot force them or ask them to do anything. They do what they choose to do. Bilawal has chosen this. And so will the other two -- if they choose to come and help their brother and help their father, they're welcome to. If they choose not, then I will not impose anything upon anybody."" He said Bhutto had trained Bilawal: ""He realizes the enormity of the situation. So therefore, he's accepted the responsibility.""  Watch Bhutto's son and husband talk about the party's future » . The teenager, speaking in English at a news conference, said, ""I am thankful for the CEC for imposing their trust in me as chairman of the Pakistan People's Party."" ""Like all chairmen of the PPP, I will stand as the symbol of the federation,"" said Bilawal Bhutto. ""The party's long and historic struggle for democracy will continue with renewed vigor, and I stand committed to the stability of the federation. ""My mother always said democracy is the best revenge.""  Watch Human Rights Watch official explain son's important symbolic role » . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke to Musharraf on the telephone Sunday, and the Pakistani leader agreed to consider international support for the investigation into Bhutto's death, according to a statement from Brown's office. Musharraf's government has previously rejected international help, specifically from Britain. ""We understand our environment better than the international community,"" Pakistani Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said Saturday. ""Scotland Yard cannot investigate in Waziristan. They don't understand Pashto."" Zardari also said the PPP is asking the United Nations to investigate the circumstances of Bhutto's December 27 killing. He said he does not plan to call for an autopsy on his wife, who was buried in her hometown on Friday. Musharraf also spoke Sunday with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, a French foreign ministry spokeswoman told CNN. After the conversation, it was announced that French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner will travel to Pakistan this week. When asked about the naming of Bhutto's successor, White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said, ""It is up to the political parties in Pakistan to choose their leaders."" ""We believe it is important for Pakistan to confront extremists and continue on the path to democracy by holding free and fair elections,"" Stanzel said. ""The timing of those elections will be up to the Pakistanis."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City moved up to second place in the English Premier League on Tuesday night after an emphatic 3-0 win over city rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford. Two goals from Edin Dzeko and a late strike from Yaya Toure eased Manuel Pellegrini's title chasers to within three points of leaders Chelsea while consigning United to a 10th league defeat this season. City carried on where Liverpool had left off nine days ago, running wild through United's defense from the kick-off. Home fans must have feared a cricket score when Dzeko scored after 44 seconds -- redirecting the ball into the net after Samir Nasri's shot had rebounded off the post. The Bosnian striker should have made it 2-0 in the 18th minute but produced a tame shot which was comfortably palmed away by United goalkeeper David De Gea. As the half wore on United came back into the game but created little in front of goal. The break only served to re-energize the visitors who buzzed around with purpose in the final third and it wasn't long before their lead was doubled. Nasri's corner was met superbly by Dzeko in the 55th minute who coolly side-footed a volley past a flailing De Gea. United tried in vain to half the deficit but with a minute remaining Yaya Toure delivered the hammer blow, making space on the edge of United's penalty area before sweeping a low shot into the bottom left corner. City now have 66 points and trail leaders Chelsea by three points, but have two games in hand on Jose Mourinho's side. United, meanwhile, are 15 points behind city with 51 points from 31 games. A top four finish looks increasingly unlikely. In the Premier League's other two fixtures on Tuesday, Arsenal could only manage a 2-2 draw against Swansea City at the Emirates. Wilfried Bony gave the visitors an 11th minute lead before two second-half strikes in two minutes -- Lukas Podolski followed by Olivier Giroud -- put the Gunners ahead with a quarter-of-an-hour to play. But disaster struck in the shape of a Mathieu Flamini own goal in injury time to see Arsene Wenger's side lose further ground on the leaders following a 6-0 mauling at Stamford Bridge last Saturday. Arsenal have 63 points from 31 games and remain in fourth. Swansea stay in 15th and now have 30 points. David Moyes' old side, Everton continue to thrive under new manager Roberto Martinez. The Toffees eased to a 3-0 win over Newcastle at St James' Park -- a result that sees them rise to fifth on 57 points, one point ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. Third-place Liverpool play Sunderland at Anfield on Wednesday. Read more: Bayern Munich clinch Bundesliga title .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The leader of the Taliban in Pakistan, Hakimullah Mehsud, was wounded in a suspected U.S. drone strike Thursday, intelligence and Taliban sources told CNN Friday. A Taliban spokesman denied Thursday and again Friday that Mehsud was hurt. The spokesman, Azam Tariq, said Mehsud had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck. He dismissed reports of an injury to Mehsud as propaganda. Other Taliban and intelligence sources, however, said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike. The drone attack killed 10 people, with four missiles landing near a madrassa, or religious school, Pakistani intelligence and local officials said Thursday. The school had been converted into a training camp for militants, the officials said. Meanwhile Friday, another suspected drone strike killed five people in the village of Zarini, in North Waziristan, two intelligence sources said. No additional details were immediately available. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. The strike happened in the village of Pasal Kot. That's in North Waziristan, part of Pakistan's volatile tribal region that is the site of previous drone strikes and clashes between the Pakistani military and Islamic militants. It comes a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video the Pakistani Taliban released. In it, he sits next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian army captain at a base in eastern Afghanistan on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not from the same family. In the video, al-Balawi said, ""We will never forget the blood of our leader Baitullah Mehsud, may God have mercy on his soul,"" according to a CNN translation. ""It will remain that we take revenge (for his death) in America and outside America. It is a trust on every person who left everything for the sake of God, whom Baitullah Mehsud supported."" At one point, the video shows the date of December 20, 2009. That is five days before Nigerian passenger Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab allegedly tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit, Michigan. The Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day plot. It is impossible to know whether the date on the video is accurate, or whether al-Balawi was aware of AbdulMutallab's alleged plans. If al-Balawi did know about the plot, it could indicate a greater degree of communication between the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda than previously thought. Among the seven CIA employees who were killed in the December 30 attack were two members of the private security firm Xe, formerly known as Blackwater. The Jordanian military officer who was killed was Army Capt. Sharif Ali bin Zeid, a cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. It was one of the worst attacks ever on America's intelligence community. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, a former U.S. intelligence official said. Al-Balawi was a Jordanian doctor whom Jordanian authorities had recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source, a Jordanian official told CNN. He said the video that his faith cannot be sold to bidders, an apparent message to Jordanian and U.S. officials that they had failed to win his allegiance. It puts into question how well the CIA and other intelligence agencies can penetrate al Qaeda.

"(CNN) -- Since appearing on season 13 of ""Dancing With the Stars,"" fans have seen less of Chaz Bono -- and he plans on keeping it that way. Bono has lost 60 pounds and is still losing, he told People. The weight loss has been the result of better eating habits and exercise, he said. ""Diets don't work,"" he told the magazine. ""You just have to change what you eat, and I have."" That includes incorporating more meat, fruits and veggies, the son of megastar Cher said, as well as cutting back on grains and starches. In 2005, Bono participated in VH1's ""Celebrity Fit Club 3"" before gender reassignment surgery that transformed him from Chastity Bono to Chaz. EW reported that in November Bono appeared on ""The Doctors"" and co-host Dr. Travis Stork advised him on how to lose weight.

"(CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is a good friend and U.S. ally, but declined to predict whether the embattled leader would heed protesters' calls to step down. Cheney made the comments Saturday night at a ceremony honoring former President Ronald Reagan in Santa Barbara, California. Protesters have pledged to stay on the streets of Egyptian cities until Hosni Mubarak relinquishes power. Mubarak, who has led the north African nation for three decades, has said he will stay in power until September, and will not run for re-election. Cheney said the Egyptian leader should be treated with respect. ""He has been a good man, a good friend and ally to the United States,"" Cheney said. ""We need to remember that."" The former vice president declined to predict whether Mubarak would step down. ""I don't want to make a prediction because I don't know,"" Cheney said. ""But I also think there comes a time for everybody when it's time to hang it up and move on and someone else will take over."" Massive demonstrations have been held in Egyptian cities since January 25 to demand an end to Mubarak's rule. Cheney said Egyptians will decide his fate as leader. ""In the end, whatever comes next in Egypt is going to be determined by the people of Egypt,"" he said.","Cheney speaks at a ceremony honoring former President Ronald Reagan .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- In South by Southwest Interactive, the tech-geek festival that begins here Friday, some see a five-day spring break of sorts: a chance to discover some buzzy new apps, catch a few panels and party alongside Web celebrities, futurists and many, many bloggers. But others see the festival as a microcosm of the larger tech-culture community, a place to preview things that may become mainstream in a few years and where trends that play out in downtown Austin are indicators of what's to come. Which is why we wonder each year: Has the festival peaked? Will the irrationally app-exuberant bubble finally burst? If SXSW Interactive doesn't keep growing at up to 40% every year, does that mean the tech industry is slowing down or that the festival itself has reached capacity? Or is it only the hype that has plateaued? This year, some SXSW veterans feel the maturing festival, which began in the late 1990s, may have reached a saturation point, especially when it comes to startups trying to draw attention to new products. SXSW Interactive famously helped Twitter get off the ground in 2007 and gave apps such as Foursquare and Highlight a boost in recent years. But as SXSW has gotten crowded, it's become much harder to stand out. ""I feel like people are having to put more effort because there's so much noise and so much going on,"" said Jennifer Sinski, an entrepreneur who runs RSVPster, which will auto-RSVP attendees to unofficial parties and events for a fee. This year, Sinski said, ""There's really no big app expected to launch, nothing huge people are excited for on the tech side."" That thought was echoed by a recent TechCrunch article wondering whether the era of big SXSW app launches may have passed. Just days before the festival starts, there have also been no big blow-out events announced to rival 2012's American Express concert featuring Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen's powerhouse gig or the party for the app Mobli that drew investors Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire to town. American Express will still be at the festival, but it will likely keep a lower profile given it announced 5,400 job cuts in January. Microsoft is no longer a sponsor at Interactive this year, and the annual TechKaraoke event will be missing. That being said, rumors that Justin Timberlake will perform continue to swirl and notables such as former Vice President Al Gore, entrepreneur Elon Musk, broadcaster Rachel Maddow and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal are part of the official programming. And this year's themes of private space travel, 3-D printing, hacker culture and crowdfunding, still feel forward-looking. Hugh Forrest, the longtime director of SXSW Interactive, says a slowing of growth may actually benefit the festival, which in recent years has put a strain on Austin's infrastructure. Forrest says that based on registration so far, the Interactive part of the festival is expected to grow at a more modest rate of 5% to 8% this year. ""It's definitely not the sharper increases we've had in the last few years,"" Forrest said. ""In many ways, that's a good thing. It gives us the bandwidth to work out some of the rough edges."" Some of the growing pains, especially in the festival's Startup Village and Accelerator (a kind of ""American Idol"" competition for startups), prompted the festival to expand its reach beyond Austin. In August, it will launch V2V in Las Vegas, a new SXSW Interactive conference focused on tech entrepreneurship. It's one way SXSW is hoping to alleviate the hotel crunch and downtown congestion that happens here every March. Stephanie Wonderlin, a senior manager and social strategist with Momentum Factor, will be attending Interactive for her third year. Last year, she hosted videos for Chevy, which was pushing its Volt vehicles to techies at the fest. Wonderlin believes things have been quieter going into Interactive this year, at least from her perspective. ""I keep asking myself, 'What do I feel is missing?' I don't know if it's me being snooty."" For 2013, she says her schedule has shifted from big parties to smaller gatherings and networking, a trend she's seeing among friends, some of whom aren't bothering to pay for a badge. ""I think the size and how big it's gotten were just so overblown that maybe people who have to be there now want to do things on their own. One person told me, 'I would rather grab a bottle of wine and head up to a rooftop with a small group of friends' than go to the big parties,"" Wonderlin said. ""A lot of people I know who are big company sponsors say they're not even going to any of the sessions. I think the purpose of SXSW has changed."" Sinski, who's been going to SXSW Music for eight years and became more interested in Interactive as she launched her company, says that people who use her service are less interested in hype and big stars than they are in free food, real networking and companies that have something unique to show. ""Spending a lot of money isn't as big a deal as it was two or three years ago,"" she said. ""Now it's about what you can offer people.""","Observers say hype around South by Southwest Interactive is more muted this year .

(NYPD policy is not to give out the full names of its detectives). He was pronounced dead at Roosevelt Hospital in New York. In a new conference, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said the boy suffered ""horrific injuries sustained over period of days."" The 28-year-old baby sitter has not been charged, according to NYPD Detective Ort. She did not confess to killing the boy, but police said she made statements to them that she abused the child. Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, said the office is looking into the cause and manner of the death.","Boy, 4, is found dead in a luxury apartment building in New York City .

"(CNN) -- Syria's nearly 3-year-old civil war saw more bloodshed Thursday, and perhaps a moment of peace. Fighting at a huge prison in the volatile city of Aleppo brought conflicting rebel claims on whether they controlled all or part of the facility. Meanwhile, the United Nations and the United States confirmed an agreement announced by rebels and the government of a planned cease-fire in the besieged Old City of Homs that would allow some people to flee and humanitarian aid to arrive for the first time in over a year. ""We welcome the news that a deal has been reached,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said of what she called ""a local humanitarian pause"" to begin Friday. An opposition spokesman in Homs, Abu Rami, said the agreement called for a cease-fire at a time to be set by the government and expected imminently. Once the fighting halts, women, civilians over 55 and children under 15 can choose to leave the Old City if they agree not to take up arms against the government, he said. After the first group of evacuations, Syrian troops would clear the way for a U.N. aid convoy packed with food and medicine to enter the area for the first time in more than a year, according to Abu Rami. ""We have nothing to give the families,"" he told CNN via Skype from the Old City of Homs. ""We are crippled because of the lack of food and medicine, which especially affects the women, children, and the elderly, so for the sake of the public good, we must agree to this cease-fire."" According to SANA, the official Syrian news agency, the government would provide shelter, food and medical treatment to people who leave the Old City. In addition, the agreement calls for government forces to allow humanitarian assistance to people who remain in the besieged area, SANA reported. Valerie Amos, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said the cease-fire agreement would mean essential supplies for about 2,500 people in Homs. ""What we're waiting for is a green light to be given by the parties for safe passage,"" said Farhan Haq, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In Washington, Psaki called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government to follow through on allowing U.N. convoys to enter Homs, adding that ""an evacuation is not a substitute for the safe, regular, and unfettered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need wherever they are."" ""We should not be giving credit to a regime just for providing food for a few days to people who are starving, given that's the right moral thing to do, and this is something they should have been doing all along,"" Psaki said. Asked about concerns that the Syrian regime might be preparing for a final assault on those who remain in Homs once the other civilians depart, Psaki refused to speculate but said it was important for the U.N. convoys to get access to the Old City. In Aleppo, Islamist brigade Ahrar al-Sham and al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front took control of the sprawling six-story Aleppo Central Prison from government forces after announcing an offensive to free detainees, opposition groups the Aleppo Media Center and Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday. However, an activist from the rebel Shahba Press Agency group, Nazeer al-Khatib, later told CNN only a part of the prison was under rebel control. He cited miscommunication for backtracking on the initial claims. ""Information came from the Ahrar al-Sham media office regarding the full takeover of the prison and media activists hurried the transmission of information,"" al-Khatib told CNN via Skype from the city. The media center and the observatory could not be immediately reached for comment. Aleppo is a major battle front in the Syrian conflict, which has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions since erupting in 2011. The prison has an estimated 3,000 detainees, many of them prisoners of conscience. At least 800 women were among the prisoners, al-Khatib told CNN. Clashes between government forces and rebels started early Thursday after rebels detonated a car bomb in front of a building in the prison complex housing Syrian army troops, the Aleppo Media Center said. Government warplanes dropped barrel bombs on the perimeter of the prison and tanks fired shells to reverse the advance of insurgents, causing dozens of casualties, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. CNN's Joe Sterling and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Women, children, elderly to get a chance to leave Homs, with aid to arrive .

"(CNN) -- Roma romped to a third successive league win on Sunday to close the gap with league leaders Juventus to six points. Cote d'Ivoire striker Gervinho provided the attacking flair with a goal and an assist as Serie A's second placed side won 3-1 on the road at Hellas Verona. Reigning champions Juve could only draw 1-1 with Lazio in the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday and Rudi Garcia's side made the most of the slip. Adam Ljajic opened the scoring on the stroke of halftime tapping in Gervinho's cutback, but it wasn't long before Verona were back on level terms as Emil Hallfredsson slotted home four minutes after the break. Former Arsenal striker Gervinho put Roma back in front on the hour mark drilling a low shot through a crowd of players before Francesco Totti guaranteed all three points -- the veteran midfielder putting away a 83rd minute penalty following a foul on Greek international Vasileios Torosidis. Roma, whose only league defeat this season came against Juventus at the beginning of the month, now have 50 points while Antonio Conte's side have 56. The Turin-based team also have a potentially tricky league match next weekend against Inter who played out a goalless draw against bottom-of-the-table Catania at the San Siro on Sunday. Walter Mazzarri's side will be desperate to reinvigorate a season which has been stuttering along since the end of November -- their last nine league games yielding just eight points. In Sunday's other games, city rivals AC Milan recorded back-to-back league wins for the first time this season with a 2-1 at Cagliari. The result nudges them up the table to ninth with 28 points, four behind Torino who beat Atalanta 1-0. Elsewhere, Sampdoria and Bologna drew 1-1, but there were more positive results for struggling Livorno and Parma. Second-from bottom Livorno's 3-1 against Sassuolo was their first since the beginning of November while Parma's 1-0 win moves them up to seventh with 32 points.

"(CNN) -- For the first time, newly released search warrant documents show why authorities began investigating former NFL star Aaron Hernandez as a possible suspect in an unsolved Boston double homicide in July 2012. The warrant and accompanying eight-page affidavit do not state whether Hernandez is believed to have been directly involved in the drive-by shooting, nor is there a suggested motive. But as CNN has previously reported, a grand jury has been looking into whether Hernandez played a role in the drive-by shooting, according to law enforcement sources. No charges have been filed and authorities have not commented publicly on the investigation. That 2012 shooting is separate from a 2013 killing in which Hernandez is charged and awaiting trial. Hernandez, 23, was indicted for first-degree murder and weapons charges by a different grand jury in August , 2013, in the shooting death of his friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. The former New England Patriots' tight end was arrested in late June, 10 days after authorities say Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player, was killed in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. The search warrant and affidavit reveal that an anonymous tipster contacted police days after Lloyd's execution-style shooting to talk about the separate drive-by shooting the previous year. A man who was identified as a security supervisor at a nightclub in Boston tipped off authorities that he ""had knowledge the two incidents were related,"" according to the newly released search warrant, which was executed in December. When a dispatcher asked how the tipster knew about two incidents that occurred nearly a year apart, the caller said, ""Someone accidentally spilled the beans on me,"" according to the warrant's affidavit, which didn't elaborate on that point. In the affidavit, a detective wrote that the man had ""very specific details"" about a suspicious vehicle with Rhode Island license plates, and information about the date, time, and place of the 2012 double homicide. The man told detectives his source for the information was a patron of the nightclub who he knew as ""B"" or ""G."" The affidavit said that, before the tipster's call, Boston detectives involved in the 2012 drive-by investigation were watching TV news reports when they heard that Hernandez was a possible suspect in Odin Lloyd's murder. The detectives remembered seeing Hernandez on the nightclub's surveillance video screened in July, 2012. These two disparate pieces of information prompted police to take a closer look at surveillance videos already examined, including those from another nightclub, called Cure, and a nearby parking garage, according to the court documents. Judge seizes home of Aaron Hernandez . After going back to the surveillance tapes, authorities recognized Hernandez driving a silver Toyota 4Runner into a parking garage just after midnight on July 16, 2012, the warrant states. About a half hour later, Hernandez is seen with another man later identified as Alexander Bradley following the soon-to-be victims of the double homicide and two other men as they entered the nightclub Cure about midnight, the affidavit adds. Ten minutes later, ""after consuming two drinks,"" Hernandez is seen leaving Cure with Bradley. the document says. At about 2:20 a.m., a video reviewed by police showed the same silver SUV looping around the block ""at a very slow rate of speed"" after the victims leave the club and enter a parking garage, the documents show. A short time later, police said, victims Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, were fatally shot in a 2003 BMW. Two others in the car survived. There is no video of the shooting. One of the survivors told police that just before the gunfire, an SUV was stopped next to them at a red light. According to the documents, another witness came forward on July 19, 2012, days after the double homicide. A man told police he and a friend saw a Nissan or Toyota SUV with Rhode Island plates pull next to his car, then run a red light the night of the double homicide. The driver was described as a ""light-skinned Hispanic man with short hair,"" the documents state. At the next intersection, the witness said, the same SUV pulled next to a BMW. Then, according to the warrant, the witness heard six quick gunshots, pulled up to the BMW, and saw the wounded men inside. He called police. At the time, Boston police asked the public to be on the lookout for a light-colored or silver SUV but were unable to locate the vehicle with Rhode Island plates. That changed after Lloyd's murder when the focus on Hernandez as a possible suspect in Lloyd's death led police to his uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut. Who was Odin Lloyd . Inside the uncle's garage, authorities discovered a silver Toyota 4Runner with Rhode Island license plates, according to sources. As CNN has previously reported, law enforcement sources believe it is the same vehicle described in the unsolved double homicide in Boston. The warrant confirms the vehicle is the same SUV given to Hernandez by a dealership return for promoting its business. Police have since recovered a .38 caliber handgun they've identified as the murder weapon in the unsolved double homicide in Boston. But police have not established a connection between the gun and Hernandez. Hernandez hit with wrongful death suit . Alexander Bradley, the man identified by the document and law enforcement sources as being with Hernandez in the club the night of the double homicide, is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face last year in Florida after they left a Miami strip club. According to law enforcement sources, Bradley has testified before separate grand juries investigating the unsolved Boston homicides and Lloyd's murder. However, before Bradley appeared before the grand juries, he was jailed in Connecticut because he failed to show up despite a subpoena. The new court documents state while in jail, Bradley's calls were routinely recorded. According to the documents, when a correction's officer listened to the conversations -- five of them in October, 2013 -- he heard Bradley ""discussing details of the Boston homicide investigation."" The affidavit doesn't reveal who he was talking to or exactly what was said. Bradley's attorney did not respond to a CNN call on Thursday. He previously has declined to address any details about his client beyond acknowledging the lawsuit.","Former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez is charged in a 2013 homicide .

"(CNN) -- Dunga, who won the World Cup with Brazil and later managed the national team, was fired by Internacional less than a year after he was appointed. Internacional, which won the last of its three top-flight Brazilian titles in 1979, sits 10th in the 20-team elite division and has lost four straight in the league. It trails leader Cruzeiro by 22 points. The slump comes even with big-name strikers Leandro Damiao -- heavily linked with Tottenham of the English Premier League -- and Diego Forlan on its books. But both are struggling in front of goal -- Damiao hasn't netted in the league since the end of August while Uruguay star Forlan's drought extends to July. He, however, has been injured. Internacional, on its website, thanked Dunga ""for his services"" and congratulated the 49-year-old for leading the team to the state championship. Clemer Melo, coach of the under-20 team, takes over on an interim basis. Dunga, a former Internacional player, won 26 of his 53 matches in charge, losing nine and drawing 18. His last managerial job also ended in disappointment, as Dunga was dismissed by Brazil not long after it lost to the Netherlands 2-1 in the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup. Brazil led 1-0. Brazil under Dunga was less free flowing and more solid defensively but entered the World Cup on a roll, having won the 2009 Confederations Cup and finishing atop the standings in South American qualifying. Dunga's approach with the national team wasn't a surprise, given he was a robust defensive midfielder in his playing days. He started every game at the 1994 World Cup and captained Brazil when it beat Italy on penalties in the final in Los Angeles. Dunga played in the 1998 World Cup final in France, too, although Brazil lost to the host 3-0.","Brazil's Internacional fires manager Dunga less than a year after he was appointed .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey's Chris Christie faced new storms, literally and figuratively, on the first day of his second term as governor with scandal buffeting his administration and now a top conservative Republican in Virginia saying he should abandon a key GOP post. All of it, punctuated by a major snowstorm that swept through the Garden State as Christie took the oath of office, put new pressure on him as he contemplates a run for president in 2016 and stands atop polls as the GOP's leading hope. Christie did not mention the unfolding scandals in his inauguration speech at the War Memorial in Trenton. Instead he praised how his state came together in his first four years to meet the challenges of the economic recession and Superstorm Sandy, as well as the landslide re-election victory voters gave him last November. ""This election has taught us that the ways we divide each other -- by race, by class, by ethnicity, by wealth, and yes, by political party -- is neither permanent nor necessary,"" he said. ""Our dreams are the same: a good job, a great education for our children, safe streets in our neighborhood and core values which give our lives real meaning."" Christie's carefully crafted strategy of success built upon reaching across the political aisle to Democrats is not necessarily a virtue shared by all Republicans, especially conservatives not yet sold on his credentials to uphold their causes in a national campaign. One prominent conservative in Virginia, former state Attorney General and 2013 gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, said Christie should step down from his new role as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, seen as a stepping stone to a White House run. Cuccinelli, who lost his race for governor, said the current state legislative investigations into suggested political misconduct by top Christie administration appointees would hinder his ability to successfully campaign for GOP candidates. ""I think just from the perspective of setting aside this as an issue in other races, it makes sense for him to step aside in that role,"" he said on CNN's Crossfire on Tuesday. Cuccinelli was unhappy with the RGA -- which Christie did not lead at the time -- for not steering more money to his effort. Christie defenders speak out . However, two Republican governors said recently they still support Christie in the RGA post. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, mentioned often as a potential presidential candidate as well, and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said in Washington they had confidence in Christie's leadership. Christie has said the uproar in his state would not impact his work on behalf of other governors. He was in Florida this past weekend to help raise money for incumbent Rick Scott. Christie's administration has been rocked by suggestions of political dirty tricks and strong-armed politics that are being investigated by a state legislative committee and the U.S. attorney's office. The lead scandal, in which investigators want to know if top appointees orchestrated traffic gridlock near the George Washington Bridge last September to politically punish a local mayor, has already cost four top advisers their jobs and spawned numerous subpoenas by a special state Assembly committee looking for documents and other materials. Christie has denied knowledge of the alleged bridge scheme. A Republican governor in a state dominated by Democrats, Christie distinguished himself from the partisanship in Washington by promoting a bipartisan vision for the Garden State. His inauguration remarks countered an image some opponents offer about an administration they say takes hardball politics to new levels in a state known for being rough-and-tumble politically. Christie scandals: What you need to know . Hours before Christie's second inaugural, a top New Jersey Republican defended him. ""He's a former federal prosecutor, indicted over a hundred politicians. He's the last guy on earth who's going to do an illegal activity. It's repugnant to him,"" said Jon Bramnick, the Republican leader in the New Jersey State Assembly, on CNN's New Day. With the next race for the White House on the horizon, and Christie said to be considering a bid, he hopes his inaugural message resonates with a national audience. However, new national polling indicates his crossover appeal among independents and Democrats, a rare characteristic that elevates his national standing, has softened. CNN exclusive: Port Authority job created for Christie ally, source says . Hoboken mayor provides more evidence . Aside from the bridge scandal, Christie's team faces questions about how the administration handled Superstorm Sandy relief money approved by the federal government. Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer this week alleged that Christie's administration hung -- or ""held hostage"" -- storm recovery funds for her town on her support for a redevelopment project proposed by a firm, The Rockefeller Group, with ties to the governor. Zimmer said Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno delivered the message in a parking lot last May, saying it came directly from Christie. Guadango denies the allegation; Zimmer is standing firm, saying she's already told her story to federal prosecutors. State legislative investigators also want to hear from Zimmer. Also on Sandy, a federal watchdog is looking into how the state used relief money in promoting the state's recovery from the October 2012 storm that devastated coastal areas. The Housing and Urban Development inspector general's office is specifically looking at spending on an ad produced for Jersey Shore marketing purposes that featured Christie and his family. Christie's office has said the Obama administration signed off on its marketing plan and vehemently denies any wrongdoing in the Zimmer matter. Who is Dawn Zimmer?

"(CNN) -- Newt Gingrich offered his second wife a choice of an open marriage or a divorce when he revealed to her he was having an affair with the woman he later made his third wife, Marianne Gingrich said in interviews with ABC News and The Washington Post. A day after he told his wife about his affair with Callista Bisek in May 1999, the former House speaker delivered a speech titled ""The Demise of American Culture"" to a group of Republican women in Pennsylvania, The Washington Post reported Thursday. ""How could he ask me for a divorce on Monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people?"" Marianne Gingrich said in her interview with the Post. The former congressman responded forcefully to the allegations at the start of Thursday's Republican presidential debate moderated by CNN, calling the story ""despicable"" and saying he was ""appalled that you would begin a presidential debate with a topic like that."" ""The story is false,"" Newt Gingrich said. ""Every personal friend I have who knew us in that period said that story was false. We offered several of them to ABC to prove it was false, (but) they weren't interested because they would like to attack any Republican."" Marianne Gingrich's revelations echo what she told a reporter for an article published in Esquire magazine in August 2010, but it is the first time Marianne Gingrich has talked about it on camera. ABC News began releasing excerpts of the interview Thursday morning, with a promise of the full interview on the network's ""Nightline"" program. ""I said to him, 'Newt, we've been married a long time,' and he said, 'Yes, but you want me all to yourself. Callista doesn't care what I do,'"" Marianne Gingrich said in the clip released by ABC, describing the couple's conversation near the end of their 18-year marriage. Her husband, who had already left Congress, was asking ""that I accept the fact that he has somebody else in his life,"" Marianne Gingrich said. ""Oh, he was asking to have an open marriage and I refused,"" she said. She said she rejected his suggestion that they remain married while he keeps a mistress. ""No, no, that is not a marriage,"" she said. The Esquire article reported that Gingrich asked his wife ""to just tolerate the affair."" Newt Gingrich's marital history is not a new controversy for the Republican presidential candidate. He married Marianne Gingrich, who was a 28-year-old congressional staffer, six months after his divorce from his first wife, Jackie Gingrich, was final. His presidential campaign has tried to frame the first divorce as something his then-wife wanted, contrary to court documents that indicated she objected to his divorce filing. Jackie Gingrich has never talked on camera about her marriage. She refused a CNN request for an interview last month. Newt Gingrich was asked about the controversy Thursday morning while campaigning in Beaufort, South Carolina, where voters will cast ballots in the GOP primary Saturday. ""It is an issue that I confront every time it comes up and I confront it exactly the same way every time it comes up and people seem to be satisfied with it,"" Gingrich said. When pressed by reporters for a reaction to his second wife's TV interview, he said that his two daughters had ""already written to ABC complaining about this as tawdry and inappropriate."" ""Both of my daughters are prepared to speak on the record with any of you who would like to talk to them. Several other people who knew the situation are prepared to speak on the record. I am not getting involved,"" the former House speaker said, hours before the debate. The letter to ABC from his daughters from his first marriage, Kathy Lubbers and Jackie Cushman, was released by the Gingrich campaign Wednesday. ""The failure of a marriage is a terrible and emotional experience for everyone involved,"" they wrote. ""Anyone who has had that experience understands it is a personal tragedy filled with regrets, and sometimes differing memories of events. We will not say anything negative about our father's ex-wife. He has said before, privately and publicly, that he regrets any pain he may have caused in the past to people he loves."" The Gingrich daughters wrote that they were confident South Carolina voters were more interested in what their father has to say ""about job creation, lower taxes, and about who can defeat Barack Obama by providing the sharpest contrast to his damaging, extreme liberalism."" ""Our father is running for president because of his grandchildren -- so they can inherit the America he loves,"" they wrote. ""To do that, President Obama must be defeated. And as the only candidate in the race, including Obama, who has actually helped balance the national budget, create jobs, reform welfare, and cut taxes and spending, Newt felt compelled to run -- to serve his country and safeguard his grandchildren's future.""","NEW: Newt Gingrich says ""the story is false"" and he's ""appalled"" it came up at a debate .

"(CNN) -- Winamac, Indiana, is pretty much how it sounds. Small -- home to fewer than 2,500 people -- rural, and it has more churches than libraries, schools and liquor stores. About 20 minutes north is a similar town by the name of Knox. This is where Thomas Lee Bridegroom was born. And just on the edge of Winamac -- between West Main and West Adams -- is a small cemetery by the name of Crown Hill. This is where he is buried. He tripped and fell off of a roof while working. He was 29 years old. In my 20-plus years as a journalist, I've written a lot about death. Thankfully, it hasn't gotten easier. The stories still touch me, although some more than others. Bridegroom's passing would be one of those. ""It wasn't easy going back there because it was the most difficult time in my life,"" Shane Britney Crone, Bridegroom's partner, told me on the phone. ""But it helped me draw out the positives of who I am. Finally, for once, I am not afraid to stand up for what I believe in and I'm proud, not ashamed, of being gay. ""Hearing from people, thanking me for sharing our story, thanking me for reminding them how important marriage equality is ... it makes me feel like I've done the right thing by making the film."" The film he's referring to is aptly called ""Bridegroom"" and it chronicles the couple's relationship as well as the legal fallout stemming from their inability to get married. Fallout such as the hospital not giving Crone any details regarding the cause of death. And being barred from the funeral. ""They told me that if I showed up Tom's father and uncle planned to attack me and knowing how his dad reacted when (Tom) came out, I had real concern for my safety,"" Crone said. How did Tom's father react? Well, according to Crone, he pointed a shotgun at his son before beating him up -- one of the more jaunting details revealed in the documentary. Bridegroom's parents have yet to publicly comment on the film and declined to participate in its making. ""A year later, I snuck into town by myself,"" Crone said. ""I knew it was going to be very difficult and I just wanted to be alone and feel whatever it is I had to feel without someone else being there. I spent an hour there, crying, talking to Tom ... the hardest part was driving away ... in that moment it finally hit me that he was gone ... that all of this was real."" When I spoke with Crone, he mentioned he was nervous about sounding stupid in the interview. Little did he know it was I who was fighting back tears with each detail of their story that he shared. In the end, the only thing that sounded stupid was the notion that the love he and Bridegroom shared was inferior to anyone else's. ""Sadly, what happened to Shane after Tom's tragic death is not uncommon for couples without the protections that marriage equality brings to their relationships,"" said Brian Silva, Executive Director of Marriage Equality USA. ""It is unconscionable that anyone already suffering the loss of someone they love, should be forced to go through this horror. This is just one reason why this fight must continue until every LGBT couple can live in safety and equality."" A fight in which New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie, finally admitted defeat. A fight Michigan's Republican governor, Rick Snyder, tries hard to avoid talking about, even as marriage equality heads to his state's court. A fight that even spilled into the supposed gay- friendly streets of Springfield, Ill where Democrats -- not Republicans -- are in power and yet afraid to vote on a bill that would legalize same-sex marriages. I joined the thousands who recently came to the state capital to offer encouragement/pressure via a rally and march. All of which reminds us that homophobia and cowardice are not exclusive to a particular party. Bridegroom and Crone, who grew up in a town in Montana similar to Winamac and Knox, met at a bowling alley in L.A. back in 2005. At the time, they were both closeted though they would later learn that their meeting was not by chance -- a mutual friend set it up. What no one could predict was how quickly they would fall in love or how that love prompted them to come out to their families a short time later. Crone's embraced him when he told them. Bridegroom's clearly had the opposite reaction. ""He was so heartbroken about the whole thing because he always wanted me to see where he grew up,"" Crone said. Despite this, the two would go on to buy a home together, start a business, build a life. One day in May 2011, Bridegroom -- a budding photographer -- was on the roof of a friend's building taking photos when he tripped and fell several floors down. On the one-year anniversary of his death, Crone uploaded a tribute to Bridegroom on YouTube, detailing their story. Crone's tribute went viral, capturing the attention of Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, creator of ""Designing Women."" She convinced him to turn the clip -- and his pain -- into a documentary. He agreed, and it debuted at Tribeca on April 23, one day after what would have been Bridegroom's 31st birthday. George Takei, who helped Crone produce the YouTube tribute, was in attendance. As was President Bill Clinton who introduced the film, saying, ""It's a story about our nation's struggle to make one more step in forming a more perfect union, for which marriage is both the symbol and substance."" It was a bittersweet moment for Crone, who moved to L.A. hoping to work in the entertainment industry. Equally as bittersweet was being in Washington when Proposition 8 -- the law that prevented Crone and Bridegroom from marrying in California -- was overturned this summer. ""I was outside the Supreme Court and it was a very emotional moment for me,"" he said. ""It was wonderful because I knew my friends could finally get married. But I was also sad because I knew that Tom and I could finally get married now ... if he were here."" Months before Bridegroom's passing, he had given Crone a ring. If you're one of those individuals still undecided on the whole same-sex marriage issue -- like some state legislators in Illinois I know -- I encourage you to watch the film. It's available starting Sunday, October 27, on Netflix and it will air that day on Oprah Winfrey's OWN. It puts a face, and heart, on a conversation that far too often gets muddied by politics and irrational fear. Two things that have nothing to do with love. ""I haven't dated anyone since Tom passed away,"" Crone said. ""It's not that I'm against the idea of it, it's just right now I'm still focused on the film and the story and just trying to heal. ""If there's any good that can come out of this, it's by using our story to educate people. ... Maybe in some ways this was all meant to be. ... I used to think Tom just had a weird last name but now ... "" But now I will never see the word ""bridegroom"" in the same light again. And hopefully, neither will you.

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Government forces fired Friday on protesters in Bahrain's capital, killing at least four of them, an ambulance worker told CNN. The violence was the latest in a series of confrontations that began Monday in this Persian Gulf island nation. ""I told everyone to put their hands up as a sign of peace,"" said one man who was covered in blood. ""Then I saw the military crouch down."" Medical sources at a hospital said at least 50 people were treated Friday for injuries in Manama, and five of them were in critical condition, including one with a bullet wound to the head. Friday's deaths brought to at least 10 the number of people killed since protesters took to the streets in Bahrain, one of several countries in the Middle East and North Africa to face a surge of dissent following the revolts that toppled longtime autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt. The casualties here occurred when security forces fired shots and tear gas at a few hundred anti-government protesters who were trying to make a push on Pearl Roundabout, the focal point of the demonstrations this week. The area had been cleared Thursday in a harsh crackdown and security forces cordoned it off. But the violence resumed there Friday as security forces unleashed a massive and sustained barrage of tear-gas canisters and gunfire, witnesses said. That was followed by ""complete chaos"" as demonstrators ran for cover, said CNN's Arwa Damon, in the capital. Afterward, witnesses reported seeing bodies loaded into ambulances. One man vowed to keep up his protest, whatever the cost. ""There would be nothing more honorable than to be killed fighting for freedom for my country,"" he said. Bahrain's special envoy to the United States, Abdul Latif Al Zayani, said that if Bahraini forces did fire live rounds, ""Probably they were warning shots only."" He added, ""The forces that were used were proportional according to the law, they were legal, they were necessary because they were stopping the shops. The economy was hurting, the national economy. We had to take action and action was taken by the law."" But he acknowledged to CNN that the protesters were not using live ammunition. Told that ambulance workers had confirmed the deaths of protesters by live rounds, he said those reports needed to be confirmed. ""The reports are still coming in. ... We have great nation and we are a small country. We cannot divide. We have to unite. It's time that we get together. Investigations will happen. And they will continue."" The crown prince himself called Friday for a return to normalcy. ""I offer my condolences to the people of Bahrain for the painful days they are living,"" said Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in a nationally televised address. ""Good morals have to prevail and everybody should exercise self-restraint at this moment. This applies to the military forces, the security forces and the citizens of Bahrain."" Many of the protesters are Shiite Muslims, who make up 70 percent of the residents of the island kingdom and have long harbored deep political and economic grievances against the ruling family, which is Sunni. At first, the protesters were asking for economic and political reforms, but their demands have changed slightly as authorities have stepped up the use of force against them. Now, many of them say they want the regime brought down and parliament dissolved. But the prince vowed not to favor one group over another. ""We are neither a country where there are only Sunnis who get whatever they want nor a country where there are only Shias who get whatever they want,"" he said. ""We are a nation of Bahrainis where everyone respects everyone."" After Salman's TV appearance, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa announced that the crown prince is to lead a dialogue ""with all parties and sections of Bahrain, without exception."" But a leading member of parliament from Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, al-Wifaq, told CNN that there can be no dialogue with the government while the military controls the streets of Bahrain. Jamil Kathem said the protests had emerged spontaneously, especially after funeral processions. He noted that there would be further funeral processions Saturday. Human Rights Watch denounced the security action. It said several patients at Salmaniyya Hospital told the group that ""the army and police opened fire without warning on a crowd making their evening prayers near the heavily guarded roundabout."" The crowd had been attending funerals for the slain protesters and ""began moving towards the roundabout"" around 5:30 p.m., Human Rights Watch said. It appears security forces fired as the crowd approached roadblocks, it said. ""The victims said the scene was peaceful and that there was no warning issued before the forces opened fire using tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition. They said the attack did not last long because people immediately started running away."" In the town of Sitra, east of the capital city of Manama, thousands of people marched Friday in the funerals of three of the people killed Thursday. Many in the crowds carried black flags or Bahraini flags, and some referred to security forces involved in the crackdown as ""criminals."" The crowd chanted praises to the people killed in the protests and called them martyrs. Some called for death to Bahrain's ruling family. Demonstrators also gathered in the village of Karzakan, seven miles west of Manama, for the funeral of another victim, witnesses said. At the funeral of one protester, mourners chanted ""death to Khalifa!"" a reference to King Hamad. Meanwhile, a pro-government demonstration was held in Manama, where people chanted slogans in support of the royal family and said the government must maintain stability and has the right to crack down on demonstrators. Many of the participants said they believe the protesters aren't considering the long-term, negative impact of their actions. Isa Al Koohejai, a pro-government member of parliament, told CNN that the anti-government demonstrators numbered only around 5,000 people, and represented a minority view in Bahrain. He said the international media were showing only one side of the story and neglecting the perspective of ""normal"" Bahrainis. ""It's not an uprising,"" he said. ""It's not a revolution."" The tiny but strategically critical country of Bahrain is a key American ally and home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. But U.S. President Barack Obama was openly critical of his ally. ""I am deeply concerned by reports of violence,"" he said Friday, citing Yemen and Libya as well as Bahrain. ""The United States condemns the use of violence by governments against peaceful protesters in those countries and wherever else it may occur."" ""The Bahraini army has done what the Egyptian army did not do and exactly what the United States and its other partners urged it not to do -- it has opened fire on its own people,"" said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. ""Donors cannot continue to provide aid to Bahrain's security forces as if this did not happen.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Portugal have received a letter from British prosecutors asking to interview people there in connection with the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, the authorities told CNN on Thursday. The letter was sent on January 10 by Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, amid a renewed push to find the British girl who disappeared while on vacation with her family in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz. She was 3 years old at the time, and the case prompted headlines around the world. The latest developments in the case come about three months after new police sketches were released of potential suspects and UK police appeared in a TV appeal for information. The program prompted a flurry of tips, and police in Portugal announced in October that they would reopen the case. Since then, the Portuguese investigation has run in parallel with the British one. Pedro do Carmo, the deputy national director of the Judiciary Police in Portugal, said last week that the Scotland Yard investigation was focused on three people but did not give further details.

"(Oprah.com) -- You can become a part of the fight against global warming. Former Vice President Al Gore shares the five things you can buy now that will help solve the climate crisis -- and save you a few bucks! Plus, more of his easy going green tips! Former Vice President Al Gore speaks onstage during Live Earth New York at Giants Stadium on July 7. Five things you can buy . 1. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs . These energy-efficient bulbs cost less than $4 and are produced by major corporations like GE. If every household in America switched five regular light bulbs for five fluorescent bulbs, it would be the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the highways for a full year. 2. Outdoor solar lighting . These yard or patio lights cost less than $20, and they don't burn any electricity or produce any CO2. 3. Programmable thermostats . Though these thermostats cost from $50 to $100, they can actually cut your heating and cooling costs. Set the setting so it's a little bit cooler in the winter and warmer in the summer when you're not in the house. A difference of 2 degrees can reduce a home's CO2 emissions by up to 9 percent over the course of a year. 4. Air filters . Changing the air filters in your heating and cooling systems regularly can knock 2 percent off of your CO2 output each year. 5. Electric water heater blanket . Water heaters use a lot of energy and generate a lot of CO2. A blanket costs less than $18 and can cut your home's CO2 emissions by almost 4½ percent. Keep green in mind! Gore says that when you're shopping for major home appliances, look for the Energy Star label. ""This is a signal that you're getting an environmentally efficient appliance that's going to save you money at the same time,"" he says. During a simple trip to the grocery store, you make hundreds of decisions that can have real environmental impacts. With just a few easy changes, you can make a positive difference in the world. Instead of regular aluminum foil or plastic wrap, buy recycled aluminum foil. It uses just 1/20th of the energy needed to produce regular foil. Look for items without extensive packaging. Most food packaging material uses some petroleum-based plastic. There are several ways to cut down on the energy and waste this produces. Look for minimally or unpackaged items instead. Experiment with bringing your own packaging or buying in bulk. Purchase brands that use bio-based instead of petroleum-based plastic. Recycle or reuse packaging materials you end up having to buy. Bring a cloth bag to the grocery store instead of using its plastic bags. An estimated 500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide each year. That's 1 million bags used per minute. And, according to the EPA, more than 380 billion of those are discarded in the United States. Less than 1 percent of those are actually recycled. Instead, these bags will clog landfills, create litter, choke streams and harm marine wildlife, like whales, seals and sea turtles. Buy local and organic. Buying seasonal, locally produced food helps in a number of ways. Most food travels 1,500 miles from ""farm to fork."" But buying local food drastically reduces the energy spent on food shipping. Local goods also tend to use minimal packaging, are fresher and come in more varieties. The best place to track down local food is at your local farmers' markets or through the Community Supported Agriculture Department. Farmers who grow produce organically use less fossil fuel and release fewer greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Organic farming is better for the land, for the farmers and for the consumers.

"(CNN) -- The build-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics has been blighted by concerns for safety but tennis star and Games Ambassador Maria Sharapova is convinced there is nothing to worry about. Be it fears for security during the 18-day-long event or doubts about how gay people will be treated, there has been a sense of uneasiness surrounding those heading to Sochi. Recent months have seen bombings in Volgograd and reports of suicide bombers dubbed ""black widows"" readying themselves for operation during the Games, which run from February 6-23. Meanwhile the host nation's government banned what it defined as ""gay propaganda"" in 2013 -- a move that many believe effectively stops the freedom of gay rights protests in Russia. Despite all of this, Sharapova, who moved to Sochi at the age of two and went on to spend much of her childhood there, is expecting the Olympics to be a success. ""Once I arrived here, I knew that all the athletes will feel extremely safe,"" the 26-year-old told CNN in Sochi. ""I certainly had my doubts before, because I've been reading a lot about the city itself. Over the last few months I've been reading a lot of the media and watching television, but now I've seen how everything has come together."" Despite her worries prior to returning to Sochi, the four-time grand slam winner has stressed that anybody attending the Games, including the athletes themselves, has no reason to be concerned. ""The security has been tough but in a very safe way and in a safe manner,"" she said. Sharapova is an Olympian herself, having represented Russia in the Olympics Games two years ago, when she won a silver medal in the women's singles. The world No. 5 experienced first hand the hard work that went into making London 2012 a success, and sees no reason why that cannot be replicated in Sochi. ""As an athlete, security is really important. I experienced it in the Summer Games and really appreciated it. I think it's extremely important and we all expect that kind of safety,"" she said, before turning her thoughts to the preparations. ""For many years we were hearing whether everything would be ready or not: whether the the rail stations would be ready, how were the athletes going to go up to the mountains from the Olympic Park. ""All those questions raised a lot of concerns, but once I got here I realized that everything would be alright."" Sharapova explained that watching the Olympics was a far bigger childhood memory for her than viewing any grand slam tennis competition, and revealed that figure skating and ice hockey were the sports she was most looking forward to following. She is similarly excited about the transition of her former home city. ""Many things have changed in the last 20 years or so,"" she said. ""It has been such an incredible turnaround since winning the (right to host the) Olympics. I am so happy that everyone has a chance to come here and visit the true meaning of the city - because at its core, it's a very beautiful city that is so full of nature. ""It's such a unique opportunity to be able to swim in the Black Sea and then drive an hour up to the mountains to ski -- that's the type of experience we want to share with everyone that comes here.""","Maria Sharapova is confident the 2014 Winter Olympics will be a success .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tensions are running high in the skies between China and Japan -- and the United States is refusing to stay on the sidelines. After Beijing upset the region by declaring a new air defense zone over a large part of the East China Sea, two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers flew through the area in what the U.S. State Department said was a planned military exercise. The U.S. aircraft ignored China's new demands that planes that fly through the zone identify themselves and submit flight plans to Chinese authorities -- despite Beijing's warnings that it could take military measures against aircraft that failed to comply. The delicate situation is a test of how China's increasingly assertive approach beyond its borders will play out against the U.S. government's promise to focus more on Asia and uphold commitments to its allies. ""China is busy designing and implementing a bolder foreign policy in light of an anticipated U.S. decline,"" Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, director of Asia-Pacific programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace, writes in a commentary for CNN.com this week. The air zone declaration is a clear example of the new approach of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has been in power for about a year, according to Kleine-Ahlbrandt. ""Unlike his predecessors, Xi is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power, increasingly probing U.S. commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo,"" she says. But for the time being, the U.S. government is standing its ground in the East China Sea. War of words . The United States and Japan have criticized Beijing's air defense announcement, saying it escalates tensions in the region and raises the risk of an incident. They say they won't recognize the new zone. China hit back at those comments with strong words of its own, describing the U.S. and Japanese statements as unreasonable and unacceptable. After news of the U.S. flights emerged, the Chinese defense ministry responded cautiously Wednesday, saying it had monitored the planes' activity on the edge of the air defense zone. The statement held back from criticizing the U.S. action. At a regular briefing later Wednesday, a journalist asked a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman if Beijing is concerned it will now be seen as a ""paper tiger."" ""I want to emphasize that the Chinese government has enough resolution and capability to safeguard the country's sovereignty and security,"" the spokesman, Qin Gang replied. Simmering dispute . The bomber flights are the strongest American involvement yet in a festering territorial dispute in the region between China and Japan over a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. After China's air defense declaration Saturday, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reiterated American support for Japan, where thousands of U.S. troops are stationed as part of a security agreement. He said the U.S. Japan Mutual Defense Treaty applies to the disputed islands, known as Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China. Uneasy encounters between Chinese and Japanese planes and ships have already taken place repeatedly over the past year near the islands, which are believed to have large oil reserves located near them. Tensions spiked after the Japanese government purchased some of the islands from a private owner in September 2012, angering Chinese authorities, who saw the move as an attempt by Japan to tighten control. Hagel warned that China's ""unilateral action"" of declaring the air defense zone ""increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations."" Amid the tensions, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will visit the region next week on a previously announced trip, stopping in Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul, South Korea. Why China's new air zone incensed Japan, U.S. Difficult to monitor . The U.S. bomber flights Monday also highlight the challenges that analysts say China faces in policing its newly claimed air zone. In its statement Wednesday, the Chinese defense ministry said that ""China has the capability to exercise effective control"" over the area. ""Beijing might have bitten off a bit more than they can chew because actually going out and monitoring these things on an ongoing basis is probably a bit beyond the capabilities of the Chinese air force right now,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of FlightGlobal, an aviation and aerospace industry website. ""In a sense, it's more a rhetorical statement, as opposed to a realistic military space,"" Waldron said. Adding to the complications and confusion surrounding the zone, Japan's two main commercial airlines said Wednesday that following a request from the Japanese government, they and other members of the Scheduled Airlines Association of Japan will not submit flight plans to Chinese authorities for flights through the zone claimed by Beijing. The two carriers, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, said the association had concluded that there would be ""no impact"" on the safety of passengers on board flights through the zone without the submission of flight plans to China. But Waldron said he wasn't entirely sure about that. From a legal point of view, he said, the airlines probably don't have to report their plans and follow all the rules requested by China. ""I think from a safety perspective, it's a good idea for them to do so,"" Waldron said. ""Just in case."" 'The right of every country' Since it declared the new air defense zone at the weekend, China has been busy making its case for why it feels the move was justified. It has pointed out that other countries already operate air defense identification zones in waters around their territory, noting that Japan has had a zone in place in the East China Sea since the 1960s. ""It's natural, it's indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace and also to make sure that its territorial integrity, its sovereignty are safeguarded,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said Tuesday. But analysts say that by declaring a zone that now overlaps with that of Japan, China has increased the likelihood of a high-risk incident in the air. South Korea and Australia have also criticized the Chinese announcement. The situation has remained tense around the islands over the past year. Japan has repeatedly scrambled fighter jets in response to Chinese government planes flying near the islands. And ships from the two countries regularly engage in high seas games of cat and mouse in waters around the islands. China slams 'inappropriate' U.S. remarks on territorial dispute with Japan . Aircraft carrier on the move . On top of the already strained situation, China's military announced on its website early Wednesday that its navy's sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was heading toward the South China Sea. That's where China has had territorial disputes with other Asian nations including the Philippines and Vietnam. The carrier, which was commissioned in September 2012 and first had aircraft leaving and landing on it two months later, set out from a shipyard in eastern China's Qingdao city on Tuesday morning, the military said on its website. As with U.S. aircraft carriers, it doesn't travel alone: two guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates are accompanying the massive ship as part of its group. The Chinese military makes no mention of the dispute with Japan and its ally, the United States. Rather, its website post notes that the carrier group's mission is to conduct training and tests. But in order to get from Qingdao to the South China Sea, the aircraft carrier group has to first go through the East China Sea. It remained unclear how close it would sail to the disputed islands. ""There are several possible courses for the voyage from Qingdao to the South China Sea and it is not clear which the Liaoning will take,"" the state-run newspaper China Daily reported Wednesday. At the same time, U.S. and Japanese forces are due to hold joint naval exercises this week off Okinawa -- a few hundred kilometers from the disputed islands. CNN's Barbara Starr, Greg Botelho, Madison Park, Steven Jiang, David McKenzie, Junko Ogura and Kevin Wang contributed to this report.","The Chinese military says it identified the U.S. military aircraft .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The death of an Indian minister's wife after a public controversy in which she accused her husband of having an affair was unnatural and sudden, a hospital spokesman said Saturday. Sunanda Pushkar's death came just days after Indian media reported that she had hacked into her husband Shashi Tharoor's Twitter account and tweeted that he was having an affair with a Pakistani journalist. Pushkar died in her room in a five-star hotel in New Delhi, CNN-IBN reported Friday. Her body was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences for examination. ""The postmortem has been completed, we have sent samples for toxicology analysis to rule out poisoning,"" Dr. Sudhir Gupta, head of the autopsy board at the hospital, told CNN. ""This is a preliminary report but we can say that it is a case of unnatural sudden death. There were certain injuries on her body but we can't reveal details at the moment."" A final report will be concluded in a few days, Gupta said. The couple were staying at the hotel for a few days, Abhinab Kumar, an aide to Tharoor, told CNN-IBN. The Pakistani journalist apparently accused by Pushkar, Mehr Tarar, dismissed the affair allegation in an article on the New Delhi Television website. On Thursday, a day before Pushkar's death was revealed, Tarar described the purported tweets as ""wild allegations."" ""Her tweets to me are so crazy that all I can do is laugh,"" Tarar said. After Pushkar's death was announced the next day, Tarar expressed shock on her Twitter account. ""I just woke up and read this. I'm absolutely shocked. This is too awful for words. So tragic I don't know what to say. Rest in peace, Sunanda,"" she tweeted. Tarar spoke to CNN on Friday, expressing grief and sorrow over Pushkar's death. ""I have been up the whole night, frozen in one spot, unable to eat or even have a sip of water,"" Tarar said. ""She had a Twitter fight with me, and then she died. I didn't even get a chance to call her up, and clear the air,"" she added. ""She seemed larger than life, always smiling, and the manner in which she died would haunt me for a long, long time."" Tarar also said the allegations of an affair were false. ""I had met the minister twice in my entire life and always in the presence of other people,"" Tarar said. ""We were in touch until June and then it was reduced to an e-mail or two in weeks."" Pushkar, a businesswoman from Dubai, and Tharoor married in 2010. The couple was active in New Delhi's glamorous social circles. Tharoor is an Indian minister for human resource and development, and a member of parliament. He is also the former minister of state for external affairs and former United Nations under-secretary-general.

"(CNN) -- Matt Aldridge would have trouble contemplating life without the Shriners Hospital for Children in Greenville, South Carolina. Maddie Aldridge has received extensive care at South Carolina's Shriners Hospital, including leg amputation. Aldridge, 28, and his 21-month-old daughter, Maddie, were born without shinbones. Both had their legs amputated at Shriners near their first birthdays. Like all care given to youths admitted to any of North America's 22 Shriners Hospitals, their surgeries and follow-up treatments were free to them. Aldridge estimates the care he received through his teens in the Shriners' system -- which admits children irrespective of their parents' income -- cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, approaching the lifetime limits of some insurance policies. Now, he and his wife, Renee, take Maddie to Greenville -- about a 90-minute drive from their South Carolina home -- at least every six weeks, partly for treatment of a hip condition. Without Shriners' cover-all-costs policy, the family would be in serious trouble, said Aldridge, who works at a Wal-Mart cell phone connection center. Renee is a stay-at-home mother, and the family doesn't have private medical insurance. ""If it weren't for Shriners, we'd be financially devastated,"" Matt Aldridge said. ""With just the care Maddie has received already, we probably would be bankrupt."" For the Aldridges and many other families, accessing care from Shriners may get a lot more difficult. The system's board says it may ask the fraternity's membership in July for authority to close six hospitals -- including the one in Greenville -- largely because the endowment fund that supports the hospitals dropped from $8.5 billion to $5.2 billion over the last year as the stock market plummeted. The others that could close are in Erie, Pennsylvania; Shreveport, Louisiana; Spokane, Washington; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Galveston, Texas. The Galveston hospital's operations have been suspended since Hurricane Ike flooded it last year.  See map of where all 22 Shriners hospitals are » . Deflated investments aren't the only reason the fund has dropped. The hospitals normally operate with donations and the fund's interest, but the system's $856 million 2009 budget is outpacing both, causing the hospitals to take about $1 million per day from the fund, said Ralph Semb, president and CEO of Shriners Hospitals. Other proposals from the system's board would close just one hospital or none, but slash spending systemwide. Leaders also are exploring other options, such as partnering with non-Shriners hospitals. But one way or another, the system must cut spending by about 30 percent to survive, Semb said. ""If we do nothing, every hospital would have to cut 25 to 30 percent from their budgets, which in effect would shut about six of them anyway, because they couldn't give the services they've been giving,"" Semb said. Still, the hospitals can't close without consent of the fraternity's membership. Two-thirds of the roughly 1,400 representatives at the group's July 6-8 Imperial Council Session in San Antonio, Texas, would have to vote for it.  Learn about the Shriners fraternity » . History shows that might be difficult. Members, some of whom transport children to hospitals themselves, killed a 2003 proposal to close the hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after a similar market downturn. ""I don't think it will happen. I don't think it should happen,"" said Carl V. Nielsen, a 40-year Shriner and a board member for the Minneapolis hospital, which is not on the current possible-closure list. ""That would leave large areas of the country without a Shriners hospital, and the cost of transportation of the patients back and forth [to the remaining hospitals] would be too great."" Shriners Hospitals, which deals with certain specialties up to age 18, have treated hundreds of thousands of children free of charge since the first facility opened in Shreveport in 1922. Most offer orthopedic care. Four, including the Galveston hospital, care for children who are burned. One of those facilities, in Sacramento, California, is treating a few children burned in Friday's day care center fire in northern Mexico. The Greenville hospital, which generally draws children from six states, gets about 900 inpatients and about 1,100 outpatient visits yearly, according to Rod Brown, the chairman of that hospital's board of governors. Since news of the possible closures broke, many -- including some Shriners and people who've used the hospitals -- have spoken out in hopes of keeping the facilities open. Hundreds have turned out for rallies in some of the cities. Several ""save Shriners Hospital"" pages on Facebook call on readers to support fundraisers. Families who lose a nearby Shriners hospital -- even those who have insurance -- would be in trouble, said Nielsen, an Iowa resident, retired attorney and former state legislator. ""Say you've got a series of operations to do on the child, and it's going to cost $100,000. Even with the good insurance policies, the families still have to pay 20 percent on that, and that's more money than most have stashed away,"" he said. The Aldridges have more surgeries in their future. In addition to being born without her shinbones, Maddie has only eight fingers. She will need operations to make her hands more efficient.  Watch how hospital's closure would affect the Aldridges » . If the Greenville facility were to close, the family would think about moving to Kentucky, where the next nearest Shriners hospital is. Or, they would stay and drive eight hours to the Kentucky facility. Option No. 1 would take the lifelong South Carolina residents from friends and relatives. The other would mean more missed days at work and school for the family, which also includes Maddie's 3-year-old sister. In any event, the family says it won't consider taking Maddie out of the Shriners system. Matt Aldridge, who took up competitive power-lifting thanks in part to encouragement from Shriners staff and competed in the 2004 Paralympic Games in Greece, said the system gives top-notch care. ""Not only is it a financial thing, but it's also quality of care,"" said Aldridge, who became a Shriner himself in part because of the care he received. ""Shriners doctors are considered to be the foremost experts in what they treat."" Semb said some of the six hospitals -- which he said were chosen because they were relatively underutilized -- could stay open if they strike a partnership with non-Shriners facilities. In such a deal, Shriners doctors would perform major surgery at the partner hospital, and the partner would bill the patients' insurance if they have it. Follow-up care would be done at the Shriners facility, still free of charge. Nielsen and other Shriners are proposing an alternative for the July meeting: Let Shriners hospitals themselves accept insurance or Medicaid from the families who have it, but cover the co-pays and deductibles. Semb said the idea has some merit, but he cautioned that to accept insurance and Medicaid, the hospitals would subject themselves to more federal oversight and possibly curtail their ability to treat patients as they see fit. Meanwhile, Renee Aldridge is circulating petitions against the closures and intends to deliver them to the San Antonio meeting. Wide swaths of the country shouldn't be deprived of the expertise and the free treatment that Shriners doctors give, she said. ""Some may be able to go to another place, but a lot of doctors won't put the time and care in that Shriners does,"" she said.","Hospitals' leaders seek savings after endowment fund shrinks in stock market .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- An investigation into the death of two brothers and the fiancee of one is focusing on an unidentified man seen in the San Diego shopping mall where one victim left work shortly before she was fatally wounded, police said Friday. San Diego police made the announcement one day after authorities identified a decomposed body found in a car trunk 100 miles away in Riverside as being that of Gianni Belvedere, 24. He was the fiance of Ilona Flint and the brother of Salvatore Belvedere, both 22, who were found shot December 24 in Salvatore Belvedere's car. What some first speculated as a love triangle gone wrong with two brothers is now a triple murder mystery. ""We have much work to do and there are many detectives working on this case,"" homicide Lt. Mike Hastings told reporters. San Diego authorities, now leading the investigation, declined to comment in detail about the Gianni Belvedere's autopsy other than to say the manner of death was a homicide, and the final autopsy report won't be available for a few weeks, said Hastings. A series of events began at 1:15 a.m. on Christmas Eve Day when Flint called 911 to report she had been shot. She had just finished working at a Macy's in the mall, which was keeping late hours for holiday shoppers, and her future brother-in-law picked her up in the middle of the night. Police found her dead in car with a gunshot wound to the head, and Salvatore Belvedere was in the driver's seat fighting for his life with gunshot wounds to the head and torso. He died three days later. Police searched for Gianni Belvedere, 24, who was listed as missing. Last Friday, police in Riverside found the decomposing body of a young man in the trunk of a car parked in a fast-food restaurant. The body was that of Gianni Belvedere. The ""person of interest"" sought by police was seen in the mall at 11:15 p.m. on December 23 and again at 12:15 a.m. on December 24, Hastings said. He was described as a man of unknown race, 5-foot-10 to 6-foot tall, wearing a black hoodie with unique white bands around the sleeves near the biceps, dressed in tan pants and all-white tennis shoes, Hastings said. He did not explain the source of that description. A Belvedere family reward of $10,000, initially offered for the location of the missing brother, is now being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction in the case, Hastings said. The two brothers worked at a family Italian restaurant in Lakeside, outside of San Diego, a friend said. Flint and the two brothers lived in the Belvedere family home in San Diego, said friend Andre Briones. The engaged couple were together for about seven years and met in Provo, Utah, where Flint's family lives. Flint then moved to San Diego at her fiance's invitation, Briones said. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Casey Wian contributed to this report from San Diego. Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Police seek a man seen in a San Diego mall before two of three homicides .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin never misses an opportunity to show off his 'action man' credentials and used a pre-Games visit to the Winter Olympics venue at Sochi to hit the ski slopes. Putin did not test out the runs which will be used by the world's best in a little over a month, but instead strutted his stuff at an adjacent ski complex run by gas giant Gazprom. Putin, who has staked his personal reputation on making the Games a success at the Black Sea resort, will likely spend several days inspecting the facilities, which come with a reported $50 billion price tag. ""In the next days, the president will closely inspect the mountain and coastal sites and again verify the preparations made for the opening of the Olympic and Paralympic Games,"" a Sochi 2014 spokesman said. His arrival in Sochi comes in the aftermath of two deadly explosions in Volgograd, which left over 30 people dead and cast fears over security arrangements for the Winter Games. Security, already tight, has been ratcheted up across Russia and in particular around Sochi. Putin visited a hospital in Volgograd on New Year's Day to speak with survivors of the blasts before heading 700km north to Sochi. He has cultivated a 'tough guy' image in the past -- not least as an accomplished judo player -- reaching 6th dan and a similar rank in karate. Putin has variously been pictured horse-riding bare-chested and swimming in a mountain stream in Siberia while on vacation. He has also played ice hockey and sat in a bobsled used by the Russian team preparing for their home Olympics. His prime minister, Dimitri Medvedev, also donned a black ski suit to ski alongside Putin and later inspect facilities.","Vladimir Putin hits the slopes in Sochi .

"(CNN) -- Samsung's Galaxy S5, the next generation of its flagship smartphone, will be released by April and may include innovative eye-scanning technology. An executive for the Korean tech giant confirmed to Bloomberg that the phone will hit stores this year on roughly the same time table as previous iterations of the device, which has emerged as the chief rival to Apple's iPhone. The Galaxy S4 was announced last March and released in April. Lee Young Hee, executive vice president for Samsung's mobile business, also told the news service that a new version of the company's Galaxy Gear smartwatch will be released at the same time as the new phone. ""We've been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year, around March and April, and we are still targeting for release around that time,"" Lee said. ""When we release our S5 device, you can also expect a Gear successor with more advanced functions, and the bulky design will also be improved."" Speaking at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Lee wouldn't say whether the eye scanner -- presumably an effort to one-up Apple's iPhone 5S with its fingerprint security feature -- is a sure thing. ""Many people are fanatical about iris recognition technology,"" she said. ""We are studying the possibility but can't really say whether we will have it or not on the S5."" She did say the S5 will look and feel significantly different than its predecessor, which some felt wasn't different enough from the Galaxy S3. ""When we moved to S4 from S3, it's partly true that consumers couldn't really feel much difference between the two products from the physical perspective, so the market reaction wasn't as big,"" she said. ""For the S5, we will go back to the basics. Mostly, it's about the display and the feel of the cover."" In November, Samsung released the Galaxy Round, with a curved, 5.7-inch screen. That release was only in South Korea, and analysts have speculated the company isn't done with curved-screen technology on its phones. At CES this week, Samsung rolled out a massive, 105-inch television with a curved screen. Released in September, Galaxy Gear helped push the growing wearable tech trend forward but, like some other smartwatches, met with mixed reviews. Some felt the watch was too bulky and had limited functionality.","Samsung says its Galaxy S5 phone will be released by April .

"(CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande and the first lady parted ways Saturday, with the leader declaring it's over and his partner of several years bidding farewell to the staff of the presidential residence. The breakup occurred in the wake of a media account earlier this month about Hollande allegedly having an affair with actress Julie Gayet. Hollande told a French news outlet Saturday he is ending his relationship with his partner, Valerie Trierweiler. ""I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler,"" Hollande is quoted as saying to Agence France-Presse. Trierweiler sent a goodbye message Saturday via Twitter to the staff at the presidential palace. ""All my gratitude goes to the extraordinary people at the Ã‰lysÃ©es. I will never forget the devotion or emotion at the time of leaving,"" she wrote. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer claimed this month he was having a two-year affair with Gayet. Speculation about the split swirled Saturday after a French national weekly reported that Hollande was expected to announce his separation from Trierweiler on Saturday, a day before Trierweiler travels to India. The story was picked up by several French media outlets. But the French presidency initially denied the report that an announcement would be made. ""It is a rumor that circulated on the Internet today. There is absolutely no confirmation of the publication of a statement today,"" the palace press officer told CNN. U.S. trip planned for February . Hollande has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but did threaten legal action. At his first press conference of the year, Hollande said he and France's first lady were going through ""painful moments."" The allegations had left Trierweiler's position in some doubt, namely ahead of a planned trip to Washington in February. She has been Hollande's partner for several years. An arts columnist for weekly magazine Paris Match, she is not married to Hollande but assumed the role of first lady at official functions following his election in May 2012. Her attorney, Frederique Giffard, told French daily newspaper Le Figaro this week that the couple were working to issue a ""clarification"" concerning their relationship. Last weekend, Trierweiler left the hospital where she'd spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue, Paris Match magazine reported. The same magazine also said she would recover for ""several days"" in an official residence in Versailles. Hollande, 59, has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election, although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life. A recent survey by French pollster Ifop with Le Journal du Dimanche found that more than 80% of respondents had not changed their opinion of the President based on the allegations of an affair. Hollande has four children from a previous relationship with Segolene Royal, a senior member of his Socialist Party and a 2007 presidential candidate. Royal announced their separation just after she lost the 2007 election to Nicolas Sarkozy.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government, schools, family and clergy to have a chance to climb ""ladders of opportunity"" to reach the middle class and beyond. Speaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live, Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work. ""In too many neighborhoods today, whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America, it can feel like, for a lot of young people, the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town,"" he said, adding ""that no matter how much you work or how hard you try, your destiny was determined the moment you were born."" Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days, Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday's State of the Union address, such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves. The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes, as well as mass killings in recent months at a school, a movie theater and even a place of worship. According to the Centers of Disease Control, there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010, and 7,220 of the victims -- 65% -- were aged 15-34. In addition, 6,151 -- or 56% -- were African American, a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population. ""This is not just a gun issue,"" he continued. ""It's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we're building, and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it."" It all starts at home, the president said, calling ""strong, stable families"" and ""loving, supportive parents"" the most important ingredients for reducing violence. Noting he was raised by a single mother, he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood, saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy. ""By the way, that's all kinds of parents,"" he added, drawing applause when he specified ""it includes gay or straight parents."" He acknowledged the challenge, saying ""it will not be easy, but it can be done."" ""No solution we offer will be perfect,"" he said. ""But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can."" Obama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation's second-highest civilian honor -- to 18 people. They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first-graders in December's Connecticut school massacre. The president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals, saying: ""We could not be more grateful to your loved ones, who gave everything they had"" for the children in their care. In his remarks later at Chicago's Hyde Park Academy High School, Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton, 15, who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington. Pendleton's parents were in the crowd Friday, just as they were at the State of the Union as guests of first lady Michelle Obama, who attended Hadiya's funeral. The president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that ""they deserve a vote,"" repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday's address at the Capitol. Chicago's record murder rate: Don't blame guns alone . Fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain. In response to Obama's State of the Union address, the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats. ""They only care about their decades-old gun control agenda â€” ban every gun they can, tax every gun sold and register every gun owner,"" NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement on Thursday. ""This president has taken the art of public deception and manipulation to a whole new level."" Obama seeks an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, that would prevent the manufacture and sale of some semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons. Obama's emotional plea might lead to vote on guns . He also proposes limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, expanding background checks to all gun transactions, including sales at gun shows. In addition, the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses, so they cannot obtain weapons. Legislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases, in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers. The NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons, and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms. In particular, opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence. Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends . Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States. However, Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence, especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle. The combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines ""facilitates mass homicides,"" Pollack told CNN, noting that professional criminals generally don't use such rifles that look like military weapons. ""The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic,"" Pollack said. The Newtown shooter, a 20-year-old man living with his mother, took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers. New player in gun control ad wars . To Pollack, such a mass killing -- while relatively rare -- ""traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention."" Studies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives, Pollack said, citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat. Obama also made that point in his remarks on Friday, saying ""it's very hard to develop economically if people don't feel safe."" In the aftermath of the Newtown shootings, the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school, rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws, which Pollack agreed was necessary. ""A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market,"" he said. For example, Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges, and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm. How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroom . In a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday, a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns. He responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called ""weapons of war."" ""It's not going to solve every problem,"" the president continued, noting that some restrictions are already in place. ""We can't purchase a grenade launcher from a store, although there may be some folks who want to buy those,"" he said. ""And the reason is we think on balance, the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that's available you can automatically purchase.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Engineers used a flying drone to peer into the damaged reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant Sunday as the crisis spurred more than 2,000 people to march against nuclear energy in Tokyo. ""I was just a couch potato critic, but here we are today with friends for the first time, and I'm sure it's the first time for a lot of people today,"" said Karima Asuma Stickan, one of the protesters. Monday marks a full month in the battle to prevent a worse disaster at Fukushima Daiichi, which was battered by the earthquake and resulting tsunami that struck northern Japan on March 11. Japan's largest utility, Tokyo Electric Power Company, has been struggling to cool down three damaged reactors and prevent a wider release of radioactivity than has already occurred. Improvisation, frustration in week four of crisis . A camera was mounted on a remote-controlled helicopter to get pictures of the damaged reactors from above Sunday in hopes of getting a better look at the damaged housings of the No. 1, 3 and 4 reactors and hopefully the pools of spent fuel inside, company spokesman Junichi Matsumoto said. The drone hovered over the plant for 28 minutes at an altitude of about 150 meters (492 feet), he said. The T-Hawk drone, built by the U.S. company Honeywell, can transmit ordinary pictures as well as infrared images, Matsumoto told reporters. Images captured by the drone are expected to be released Monday, he said. In addition, the company is now using remote-controlled heavy machinery to clear away debris outside the plant and has begun the process of laying new pipes to start pumping radioactive water out of the flooded basements of the turbine plants behind units 1 through 3. Driving into Japan's radiation zone . One worker fell ill during the work on Sunday, the company said. The man, in his 30s, was placing hoses for collecting the contaminated water from reactor No. 2 when he became ill, nearly two hours into his shift. The subcontractor was taken to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with exhaustion, Tokyo Electric said. He was exposed to 4.82 millisieverts of radiation, but no radioactive substances were found on his body. His cumulative exposure is 16 millisieverts, well below the 250-millisievert limit for workers in the plant. He was with a group of 30 subcontractors working in the area, and was wearing protective gear, the company said. Japan launches new search for quake victims . The man had been working four-hour shifts since March 23, Tokyo Electric said. It was unclear whether he had received a day off. Meanwhile, two of the world's largest concrete pumps were en route to Japan on Sunday as part of the effort to help resolve the crisis. The pumps left the United States on Saturday -- one from Los Angeles and the other from Atlanta, said Bill Dwyer, vice president of sales and marketing for Putzmeister America, the pumps' manufacturer. Although the pumps were built to pump concrete, they can be modified to pump water at high pressure, with a 230-feet reach and ""pinpoint accuracy,"" Dwyer said Sunday. ""It allows workers to work from a greater distance,"" he said. One pump is set to arrive in Japan on Monday and the second on Tuesday, he said. Workers have been pouring hundreds of tons of fresh water a day into the three damaged reactors and the spent fuel pools of units 1-4 to keep them cool until normal circulation systems can be restored. The No. 2 reactor is believed to be leaking highly radioactive water, some of which had been spilling into the Pacific until Wednesday, while flooded basements in the turbine plants of all three units are making it impossible to restore power, company officials say. To make room for the fluid, Tokyo Electric has been dumping less contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean from a waste treatment facility on the site. That process -- which also includes the release of radioactive water from the drainage basins beneath reactors 5 and 6 -- was nearly complete Sunday evening, Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported. The radioactive particles in the water are dispersing into the ocean. But concentrations of radioactive iodine-131 remained 25 times higher than the Japanese legal standard in water sampled 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of the plant on Saturday. That's down from 93 times the limit on Wednesday, according to sampling data released Sunday. Levels of longer-lived cesium-137, which takes 30 years to lose half its radioactivity, remained nearly six times the legal limit but well below levels reported earlier this week. The discharge was billed as an emergency measure, but it infuriated Japan's fishing industry and drew protests from neighboring South Korea. And participants in Sunday's protest in Shiba Park, at the foot of the landmark Tokyo Tower, expressed concern about the long-term effects of the radioactive releases so far. Japanese turn in cash found in tsunami zone . ""The air pollution gets into the lungs,"" said Dr. Nobuhiko Murapsu, a pulmonary care physician from Chiba Prefecture, north of Tokyo. ""Five years, 10, 20 years later, they get lung cancer. This is a very severe problem."" Murapsu said he's changed his views on nuclear power since the accident and decided to join the demonstration. Protesters marched from the park, ringed with cherry blossoms, to Tokyo Electric's headquarters and on to the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates Japanese nuclear power plants. Makiko Mikami told CNN that no one believes they're getting enough answers from either the utility or the government. ""The problem is, I think I'm not sure they know the whole picture themselves,"" Mikami said. ""If they know, they should share that information with us. And if they don't, they should admit that they're scared as well."" Susan Olson and Yuki Arakawa contributed to this report for CNN .","NEW: Large pumps set to arrive in Japan this week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Look up at any presidential event and you're likely to see them: men dressed in black, armed to the teeth, looking back. Countersniper teams ""will be familiar with every potential threat,"" according to the Secret Service. It's no secret; they're with the Secret Service. On Tuesday at the inauguration, members of the U.S. Secret Service's elite countersniper unit will be out in force, taking  roof-top positions along Pennsylvania Avenue and elsewhere as the presidential motorcade glides past throngs of people for the swearing in of Barack Obama. The Secret Service doesn't mind you knowing they are up there. In fact, their mere presence at the inauguration has a deterrent effect, they say. But they are mum about many other details, including how many teams will be deployed, how long they work and about their custom firearms.  Watch countersniper detail up-close » . Unit commander Lt. Bernard Hall jokingly calls the weapon a JAR -- ""Just Another Rifle."" Since the unit formed in 1971, the unit has never had to fire a JAR to safeguard a person they are assigned to protect. ""When you look at that parade on the day of the inauguration, every building that we will pass by ... has been surveyed, and that is done by the Countersniper Team,"" said Secret Service director Mark Sullivan. ""They will be familiar with every building; they will be familiar with every potential threat."" But the absence of gunfire -- a welcome absence in this line of work -- doesn't mean they have never identified or mitigated a threat, Sullivan says. The teams typically consist of two people, both armed with high-powered rifles, either of whom can shoot to deter an imminent threat. If one countersniper spots a threat, that person prepares to shoot while the other member takes on the role of ""wind caller,"" telling the shooter how to adjust his aim to counteract the wind. The wind caller takes cues from chimney smoke, flags or undulations from the atmosphere. At a firing range outside of Washington, the team demonstrates its skills in a variety of positions. Both men peer through high-powered binoculars looking for threats. ""Watch the threat area,"" an instructor shouts. Thirty seconds pass before a target pops up down range. One of the countersnipers drops his binoculars and reaches for his weapon, shouting to his colleague. ""Left side. Left side,"" the wind reader responds. The shooter fires one shot. ""Center! In the middle,"" the instructor reports. While the countersnipers can scan the crowds below, their focus is on looking for places where snipers might be concealed, team members say. All countersnipers go through nine weeks of intense training. Half of those who try out for the team fail. Fewer than 200 people have been assigned to the unit in its 30-plus year history, the service says. There are fewer than 100 countersnipers in the unit, a Secret Service spokesman says. This isn't a job for someone who can't handle extreme temperatures. The cold can be biting; the heat, blistering. Hall said officers have tricks for keeping mental focus in inclement weather. ""When it's hot, we're probably thinking about the cold days in January. When it's cold, we're probably thinking about August,"" he said. On Tuesday, in addition to the snipers, an estimated 8,000 police officers will be on duty, along with almost 1,000 FBI personnel, Transportation Security Administration screeners and others, including 10,000 National Guard troops. The Department of Homeland Security has said that another 20,000 members of the National Guard are being held in reserve. ""I think we are ready,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.

"New York (CNN) -- Authorities have arrested a man they claim was plotting to detonate pipe bombs in and around New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday night. The intended targets of Jose Pimentel, 27, were U.S. military personnel who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as U.S. postal facilities and police in New York and Bayonne, New Jersey, according to Bloomberg and New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. The suspect was described by Bloomberg as an ""al Qaeda sympathizer,"" though he is not believed to have ever worked with or received training from anyone in that terrorist organization. ""There is no evidence he worked with anyone else,"" Bloomberg said. ""He appears to be ... a lone wolf."" The police commissioner identified the suspect as a follower of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born cleric who rose to become a top figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Pimental allegedly tried to contact al-Awlaki directly, but never got a response. An unemployed native of the Dominican Republican who is a U.S. citizen, Pimentel had lived most of his life in Manhattan, except for five years in Schenectady, New York. He'd had been monitored by authorities since 2009 and his extreme positions ""made even some of his like-minded friends nervous,"" said Kelly. The commissioner said that Pimentel even talked about changing his name to Osama Hussein -- in honor of his now deceased ""heroes,"" long-time al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Last August, the suspect allegedly decided to carry out the bomb plot. He ""jacked up his speed"" after September 30, when al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen, according to the police commissioner. After that strike, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a ""eulogy"" in which it promised to ""retaliate soon"" for the deaths of al-Awlaki and three others. That threat prompted the United States to issue a worldwide alert warning of such attacks. ""We knew for the last two years, he's been reading a lot of jihadist information and talked a lot of inflammatory rhetoric,"" Kelly said of Pimentel. ""But it appears at this juncture the death of Anwar al-Awlaki motivated him and made him increase his tempo."" Pimentel bought ingredients for the three bombs that he was working to make at Home Depot and other stores, mindful to shop around so as not to ""raise red flags,"" according to the commissioner. He allegedly planned to test an explosive device in a mailbox before using it against other targets. His aim, the police commissioner said, was to show there were ""mujahedeen"" -- or Islamic militants -- in the city ready to wage ""jihad."" He was arrested at 3:30 p.m. Saturday in an apartment in Washington Heights, a neighborhood in northern Manhattan, after he began to drill holes in the would-be pipe bomb, Kelly said. While authorities had monitored him for over two years, they decided to move quickly for fear that device may explode, according to the commissioner. ""Pimentel's behavior morphed from simply talking about such acts to actions -- namely, bomb making,"" said Kelly. The suspect allegedly learned how to make a pipe bomb after reading an article entitled ""How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom"" in Inspire, the al Qaeda terrorist network's English-language online propaganda, recruiting and training magazine. The issue that came out just before al-Awlaki's death, for instance, emphasized that al Qaeda supporters in the West should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves. ""He was a reader of al Qaeda's slick online magazine Inspire -- and inspire him it did,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said. ""His stated desire to attack our servicemen and women ... could have come from an al Qaeda playbook."" Vance said that his office and other New York authorities had long been ""in communication with federal authorities."" That said, Pimentel was arrested by state law enforcement agents and will be tried in New York courts. Specifically, the district attorney announced that his office filed charges Sunday against Pimentel for conspiring to build a bomb for terrorist purposes and possessing a bomb. Neither Bloomberg, Kelly nor Vance gave details on where Pimentel was being held or when he would appear in court. It could not be determined Sunday night whether Pimentel had retained an attorney.

"(CNN) -- The White House found itself on the defensive Friday over what would ordinarily be considered the most uncontroversial of events: a back-to-school speech to the nation's children. The White House says President Obama's address next week to schoolchildren isn't a policy speech. The White House said the address, set for Tuesday, and accompanying suggested lesson plans are simply meant to encourage students to study hard and stay in school. Many conservative parents aren't buying it. They're convinced the president is going to use the opportunity to press a partisan political agenda on impressionable young minds. ""Thinking about my kids in school having to listen to that just really upsets me,"" suburban Colorado mother Shanneen Barron told CNN Denver affiliate KMGH. ""I'm an American. They are Americans, and I don't feel that's OK. I feel very scared to be in this country with our leadership right now.""  Watch how some parents are upset » . School administrators are caught in the middle of the controversy. Some have decided to show the president's speech, while others will not. Many, such as Wellesley, Massachusetts, superintendent Bella Wong, are deciding on a class-by-class basis, leaving the decision in the hands of individual teachers. ""The president of the United States has asked us to facilitate his outreach to students. And in that vein, we have decided to honor the request,"" Wong told CNN. ""We'll trust in his judgment."" Republican leaders have not shied away from the debate. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a possible contender for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, said Friday the classroom is no place to show a video address from Obama.  Watch the debate over the president's speech » . ""At a minimum it's disruptive. Number two, it's uninvited. And number three, if people would like to hear his message they can, on a voluntary basis, go to YouTube or some other source and get it. I don't think he needs to force it upon the nation's school children,"" he told reporters at the Minnesota State fair. Florida GOP Chairman Jim Greer released a statement this week accusing Obama of using taxpayer money to ""indoctrinate"" children. ""As the father of four children, I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama's socialist ideology,"" Greer said. ""The idea that school children across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans ... is not only infuriating, but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans, while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power.""  Watch why some conservatives are angered by Obama's school speech » . Nonsense, the White House replied. ""The goal of the speech and the lesson plans is to challenge students to work hard, stay in school and dramatically reduce the dropout rate,"" an administration spokesman said. ""This isn't a policy speech. It's a speech designed to encourage kids to stay in school."" White House officials noted that Obama's speech, which will be available for anyone to view on the Web on Monday, is not unprecedented. President George H.W. Bush delivered a nationally televised speech to students from a Washington D.C., school in the fall of 1991, encouraging them to say no to drugs and work hard. In November 1988, President Ronald Reagan delivered more politically charged remarks that were made available to students nationwide. Among other things, Reagan called taxes ""such a penalty on people that there's no incentive for them to prosper ... because they have to give so much to the government."" Charles Saylors, president of the national Parent Teacher Association, said the uproar over Obama's speech is ""sad."" ""The president of the United States, regardless of political affiliation, should be able to have a presentation and have a pep talk, if you will, to America's students,"" he told CNN. Some of the controversy surrounding Obama's speech stems from a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the address. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After pressure from conservatives, the White House said that the plan was not artfully worded, and distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals."" A number of the president's critics, however, were not placated. ""As far as I'm concerned this is not civics education -- it gives the appearance of creating a cult of personality,"" said Oklahoma state Sen. Steve Russell, a Republican. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed the whole dispute Friday as part of ""the silly season."" The administration, while acknowledging it made a mistake with the initial lesson plan, has been frustrated by the controversy, said CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry. It was a much different atmosphere when Bush made similar remarks 18 years ago, Henry noted. ""Let's face it. You didn't really have blogs. You didn't have as many cable networks out there as you do now,"" Henry said. ""I think people just sort of take something and blow it out of proportion in this environment right now."" The controversy is the latest example of how sharply polarized political debate has become. ""Ninety percent of Americans who identify with the president's party approve of him, but 85 percent of those who belong to the opposition party disapprove,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""In that kind of environment, almost nothing Obama does is immune from politics.""","National PTA president calls uproar over President Obama's speech sad .

"(CNN) -- Germany's Nico Rosberg ushered in Formula One's new era with a dominant victory in the Australian Grand Prix Sunday as defending four-time champion Sebastian Vettel and polesitter Lewis Hamilton were forced to retire. Rosberg finished 24.5 seconds clear of Australia's Daniel Ricciardo, with rookie Kevin Magnussen in third, the first Dane to occupy a podium spot at a grand prix. But just hours after Australia's Ricciardo had celebrated a stunning debut for Red Bull in front of his home crowd, his dreams came crashing down. Ricciardo was excluded following a decision by the FIA, the sport's governing body, that he had breached fuel consumption rules. McLaren's Magnussen moved up to second and his teammate Jenson Button was promoted to third. Red Bull said in a statement: ""Inconsistencies with the FIA fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane. ""The team and (engine supplier) Renault are confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations."" Ricciardo's teammate and world champion Sebastian Vettel suffered a sorry opening to the season. The German slipped back through the field after starting from 12th on the grid, unable to engage full power in his car before pulling out on lap six of 57 at Albert Park in Melbourne. The same fate also befell Hamilton, who was passed by his Mercedes teammate Rosberg off the start and retired after only three laps. A crash on the first corner saw Kamui Kobayashi's return to F1 with Caterham come to abrupt end, taking out an unhappy Felipe Massa in the Williams. Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas showed the car was competitive, charging through the field until he brushed the wall on the 10th lap. Debris from the crash meant the safety car was deployed, although Finland's Bottas was able to recover to finish a fine sixth. All the while the unflappable Rosberg was never under any serious challenge as he raced to his fourth career F1 victory. He was quick to praise his team for giving him such a dominant car under the radical new regulations deployed for the 2014 season. ""What a car you have given me, what a car,"" he said on race radio as he celebrated. Rosberg, whose father Keke won the 1982 world title, summed it up during the podium celebrations: ""I took off from the start like a Silver Arrow and after that the car was really quick today."" Outside the podium positions, Jenson Button underlined McLaren's early pace by finishing immediately behind his teammate Magnussen in fourth, with two-time world champion Fernando Alonso battling for fifth for Ferrari. Bottas, who lost lost his right rear wheel in his earlier crash, was able to limp back to the pits for new tires and worked his way back again to claim three more points than Williams managed in the entire 2013 season. Veteran Brazilian Massa may well have also been prominent, but was left fuming by Kobayashi's early antics which left both of them in the gravel. Japan's Kobayashi immediately took to Twitter to apologize for ""messing up"" but Massa was calling for a ""big penalty"" over the incident. Race officials later blamed the crash on a serious brake problem with the Caterham and said they would be taking no further action against the driver. On a day when up and coming stars such as Ricciardo and Magnussen were able to challenge the established F1 order, a new record was set by Daniil Kvyat of Russia. His 10th spot for Toro Rosso meant at 19 year, 10 months and 18 days he became youngest driver to claim points in a grand prix, a mark previously held by Vettel. Other points were taken by Nico Hulkenberg for Force India in seventh, with Kimi Raikkonen crossing eighth in his Ferrari and Jean-Eric Vergne in ninth, just ahead of teammate Kvyat. McLaren has the early lead in the constructors' title after the sterling performances of Magnussen and former world champion Button. Despite his early exit, Vettel took comfort from the performance of Ricciardo after Red Bull's early season testing had been blighted by difficulties. ""Although we have started on the back foot we have learned an awful lot, and when the package comes together we will be competitive,"" said the 26-year-old. Hamilton knows his Mercedes is capable of racing at the front of the grid, but warned that all the teams were grappling with the big changes to the cars. ""This is a new era, this is what is happening. You can't expect us all to finish the race without a few problems,"" said the Briton after his retirement. A total of 14 drivers out of 22 were officially classified in the race results, but all the teams will be working frantically before the second round of the championship in Malaysia in a fortnight.","Nico Rosberg wins F1 season-opener in Australia .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has freed John Short, a 75-year-old Australian missionary whom it detained last month. ""The relevant organ decided to expel him from the territory of the DPRK, thanks to the tolerance of the law of the DPRK and in full consideration of his age,"" the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Monday. The agency said Short ""committed a criminal act by secretly spreading his Bible tracts around a Buddhist temple in Pyongyang,"" after entering the country as a tourist. Short's wife, Karen, said she had been told by an Australian Embassy official that her husband had arrived in Beijing. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it had received confirmation that Short had been released and was being deported. ""Clearly, this is welcome news for Mr. Short, his family and his supporters,"" the department said. KCNA published a written apology that it attributed to Short. ""I now realize the seriousness of my insult to the Korean people on February 16th because I made the Korean people angry and for this I truly apologize. ""I realize that my actions are an indelible hostile act against the independent right and law of the DPRK. ""I request the forgiveness of the DPRK for my actions,"" Short reportedly wrote. KCNA also accused him of ""spreading his Bible tracts in the Pyongyang Metro on a crowded train, causing a chaos in the sound public order of the DPRK,"" in August 2012. North Korea is known to push high-profile detainees to make false confessions. Merrill Newman, an American veteran of the Korean War detained by North Korea last year, said that he was made to deliver an ""apology"" on state media that was not his own words. Short's wife said last month that he had Gospel tracts in Korean with him in Pyongyang and that that issue seemed ""to be at the core of the detention."" Short, a citizen of Australia, lives in Hong Kong. North and South Korea hold first family reunion in three years . His wife said Monday she didn't yet know when he would arrive back in the city, a special administrative region of China. ""Australian consular officials stand ready to provide assistance to Mr. Short to ensure he can return to his home in Hong Kong as soon as possible,"" the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. Short has been arrested multiple times while doing evangelical work in China ""for speaking out about brutality against Chinese Christians,"" according to a biography on a religious website named Gospel Attract. In the 1990s, he became ""persona non grata"" with Chinese authorities for almost two years and was unable to visit mainland China, the biography said. Last year, North Korea sentenced Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, to 15 years of hard labor on charges he planned to topple the government through religious activities. Washington has repeatedly called on Pyongyang to release Bae, expressing concerns about his health. But Kim Jong Un's regime has so far refused to budge. Bae, 45, was widely reported to have been conducting missionary work in North Korea. His family says he ran a company specializing in tours of the secretive country. North Korea has a number of state-controlled churches, but the authoritarian Communist regime doesn't tolerate independent religious activities. The regime ""considers the spread of Christianity a particularly serious threat, since it challenges ideologically the official personality cult and provides a platform for social and political organization and interaction outside the realm of the state,"" a United Nations panel said in a report released last month. ""People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination,"" the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said.

Three people died in the small northwestern Arkansas town of Cincinnati, which reported power outages after the strong storm went through, said Ann Upton, Washington County's emergency management deputy. Two additional fatalities occurred in Dent County, Missouri, according to Salem police spokeswoman Wanda Suhr. While a sixth storm-related death happened at a home just north of Rolla, Missouri, about 106 miles southwest of St. Louis, said Phelps County Emergency Management spokeswoman Sandy North. The storm injured residents and destroyed some 25 homes in Phelps County after it earlier left more than a dozen people hospitalized in northwestern Arkansas, medical officials said. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency. ""We have three confirmed deaths today. We have some other people with some significant injuries and that's why I declared a state of emergency. Our state emergency management folks are up and operating to assist the locals and provide whatever support is necessary,"" he told CNN. The governor, who is expected to tour the affected areas Saturday, said officials are still working to access the damage. In Arkansas, Washington Regional Medical Center spokeswoman Terry Fox said several people were also reported trapped under fallen debris in the storm's immediate aftermath in Benton County. Six homes and four chicken production facilities were destroyed, while five homes suffered moderate to heavy damage, said Matt Garrity, Benton County's manager of emergency services. A fire station, three buildings and one store were also damaged, said Garrity, and an airport that serves northwestern Arkansas was closed due to debris in the area. ""We are in part of tornado alley,"" he said. ""So even a small storm does a lot of damage."" Emergency crews are currently surveying the extent of the damage and ""making sure that no one is trapped,"" he said. In Mississippi, a storm system knocked out power to nearly 20,000 homes in the central part of the state, said Mara Hartman, a spokeswoman for Entergy Corporation. Elsewhere, the fast-moving storm caused injuries and damage in Pulaski and Laclede counties in Missouri, knocking out power at Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army post that took a direct hit from a suspected tornado, accordingto Laclede County Emergency Management spokesman Gail Teter. Four people at the base were treated for minor injuries after the storm hit, the army said. The tornado cut through several miles from the training areas into where families live. The series of storms that moved through Oklahoma and into northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri have reached speeds of 40 mph and passed through more populated areas in St. Louis, Missouri, and the surrounding municipalities. Search and rescue workers were deployed to assess the storm's damage in St. Louis County, where there were reports of injuries, according to Mark Diedrich, the county's emergency management acting director. CNN affiliate KMOV on Friday broadcast images of heavy damage -- including destroyed homes and overturned vehicles -- in Sunset Hills, Missouri, approximately 15 miles southwest of St. Louis. ""It's causing havoc,"" said Sunset Hills police spokeswoman Donna Palasky. The storm also left heavy structural damage to buildings in its wake -- including a popular shopping center and Catholic church -- in the town of Fenton, some 18 miles southwest of St. Louis, said Fenton Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Heidbreder. Emergency crews are surveying the damage, he said, but there were no reports of injuries. In the nearby town of Ballwin, police spokeman Jim Heldmann said the storm caused heavy damage to homes and buildings, but no injuries were reported at this time. The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management issued a tornado advisory as bad weather lingered in the state, instructing residents to seek shelter in their home's interior rooms or on its lowest floor. ""When a tornado is sighted, the most important rule is to get low and stay low,"" the statement said. The threat of severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes will continue through Friday evening across the Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley states, according to Greg Carbin, meteorologist for the National Weather Service.

"Washington (CNN) -- The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate group known as Al-Shabaab has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash every year from a variety of schemes involving extortion, illegal taxation and other ""fees,"" according to a United Nations report. The United States believes the group is closely coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and may be plotting attacks in the region and abroad. The terrorist group now ""generates between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,"" according to the July 18 report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. The group has a long history of hindering humanitarian aid deliveries to millions suffering from drought and famine. In recent months, the U.S. military and the CIA have stepped up covert operations inside Somalia in an effort to counter the growing Al-Shabaab capabilities. One U.S. official says there are now estimates that Al-Shabaab controls up to 1,000 fighters in the country. He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the information. ""I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent,"" says General Carter Ham, commander of the U.S. Africa Command. Speaking to his own troops recently, Ham said: ""Even if you don't think the humanitarian need is compelling enough ... to me there is a security angle to this which affords us an opportunity as a nation, as a collective group of nations, to really take an effort to undermine what Al-Shabaab is trying to do in Somalia."" The Al-Shabaab organization ""presents an increasingly acute regional and international threat,"" according to the U.N. report. The monitoring group says despite infighting and some military defeats, ""the economic health of Al-Shabaab is more robust than ever."" Funds are being used to pay for fighters, weapons and ammunition and continued fighting against the fragile Somalia security forces and African Union troops in the country. ""Al-Shabaab is evolving from an armed faction into a lucrative consortium of business interests, both within Somalia and abroad, whose members benefit from cartel-style trading practices, tax breaks and mutual facilitation. Moreover, there are indications that Al-Shabaab trading networks may also be used to camouflage charitable contributions from sympathizers in the Gulf States,"" the report reads. Al-Shabaab's economic growth has emerged largely since October 2009 when it won control of the southern port town of Kismaayo and other nearby ports. The group now generates an estimated $35 million to $50 million a year from port revenues. Another $30 million to $60 million a year comes from ""taxes"" on businessmen operating in marketplaces in the capitol of Mogadishu and other towns. ""In addition to those taxes on businesses, Al-Shabaab operates a comprehensive web of mobile military checkpoints where transportation operators and passengers are all obliged to pay taxes for free passage,"" the report reads. The U.N. report offers extensive details on Al-Shabaab's arms smuggling operations, as well as what the U.N. says are credible reports of potentially illegal arms shipments coming in by air and sea into southern Somalia and then being shipped to fighters throughout the country. ""During the Ramadan offensive in August and September 2010, for instance, several lorry loads of arms and ammunition arrived in Mogadishu just days after a consignment of weapons reportedly landed at Kismaayo airport,"" it reads. The report also identifies key Al-Shabaab fighters including the one insurgent leader who is ""believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters,"" most of whom are from Kenya.","Al-Shabaab reportedly generates between $70 million and $100 million per year .

"(CNN) -- Atletico Madrid moved back ahead of city rivals Real Madrid in La Liga on Sunday with a 4-2 away win at Rayo Vallecano. An entertaining match got off to a lively start as David Villa opened the scoring for the visitors in the eighth minute. The former Barcelona forward scored from close range after receiving a pass from strike partner Diego Costa. The lead looked as though it would be short-lived when Rayo were awarded a penalty four minutes later following Javier Manquillo's foul on Alberto Bueno inside the box. But Jonathan Viera failed to convert the spot kick -- his shot saved by Atletico keeper Thibaut Courtois. World Sport Blog: How not to appoint a football manager . The home side were punished for their profligacy when Arda Tudan doubled the lead in the 30th minute. Viera made amends for his penalty miss with a goal five minutes before the break, but Tudan's second strike in the 44th minute restored Atletico's two-goal cushion. Costa, who has been linked with English Premier League side Chelsea during the January transfer window, weighed in with a fourth 15 minutes before the end, before Argentine striker Joaquin Larrivey headed home a consolation goal moments later. Diego Simeone's side will be happy to get back to winning ways after successive home draws. Three points gives them 54 in total from 21 matches, one point more than Carlo Ancelotti's men, who assumed top spot for 24 hours after beating Granada 2-0 at the Bernabeu on Saturday. Turbulent week for Barca ends with a win . Barcelona's players were looking forward to getting back on the pitch after a turbulent week off it for the club's bosses. Sandro Rosell dramatically quit as Barcelona president on Thursday after a Spanish judge decided to investigate the $78m deal that brought superstar Neymar from Brazilian club Santos to the Catalan giants last June.

Speaking on Saturday, head coach Gerardo Martino said: ""It's not the kind of situation we would want to be in. The players are sad but they know the best way forward is to do things well in footballing terms. ""The dressing room seems in good shape to me. They are enjoying life at Barca and they need to win like every year and respect the club's playing style in winning trophies."" That aim is still very much on track after dispatching Malaga 3-0. Gerard PiquÃ©'s right-footed shot in the 40th minute gave Barca a vital lead at the break which they quickly consolidated. Pedro made it 2-0 nine minutes into the second half with Alexis Sanchez adding a third on the hour mark. The win puts the reigning champions back on top, level on points with Atletico but with a superior goal difference.

"(CNN) -- Heather Mills' dream of skiing at the 2014 Winter Paralympics is over but the recriminations keep on flying. Earlier this week the British Paralympic Association said Mills had made herself unavailable for selection in Sochi after an issue with an adaptive boot she uses to ski. Mills, former wife of Beatles star Paul McCartney, had her left leg amputated below the knee after a road accident in 1993 and declared her intention to try and make the Games over two years ago. But now she has been accused of grabbing an official from the International Paralympic Committee during a discussion about the eligibility of her equipment. Craig Spence, the IPC's director of communications, told the UK Press Association that Mills had to be restrained after an alleged confrontation with the organization's skiing chief Sylvana Mestre. Now Mills could be fined for her outburst, though the sequence of events presented by the IPC has been disputed by her own team. ""She was screaming, 'you're a b***h, you're a b***h, you don't know who I am, I'm going to make your life miserable,'"" Spence was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. ""Sylvana tried to walk away and Heather moved and grabbed at her and had to be restrained by the British coach. ""Heather has subsequently claimed in her statements that she has got an injury caused by the IPC forcing her to wear a heavier boot, but as far as we're aware she has been using the unapproved boot all season. ""We had notified her and her coach that if she continues to compete on that boot she would be disqualified but that her results from the season and Monday would still stand. ""Heather's subsequent statement that she had been disqualified is nonsense."" Despite missing out on Sochi, Mills has not given up on winter sports competition. ""Sylvana Mestre will step down after Sochi and maybe then the management of disabled sport can be reassessed, so that disabled athletes are treated with fairness and supported in their attempts to represent their country, in the same way able-bodied athletes are,"" said a Mills statement. ""Although her hopes and dreams for Sochi are now over, Heather hopes to one day compete in Winter sports when the IPC re-evaluate the unfair systems that they have in place. In another statement given to the BBC, Mills' team also refuted the IPC's version of events. It read: ""Heather waited patiently -- as the IPC confirmed -- to try and explain to Sylvana Mestre that her left boot was legal and purely cosmetic to abide by the archaic IPC rules. ""It was just cut down and the buckles removed to stop more weight limb damage."" The statement went on to claim Mestre had shouted at Mills, refusing to let a Great Britain coach who was present explain the situation, before storming off. Mills has won a series of medals since launching her bid to make the British Paralympic team, but has also suffered a string of injuries, fracturing her shoulder, snapping her cruciate ligament and damaging her scapula. She married former Beatle Paul McCartney in 2002, four years after the singer's late wife Linda died, but the couple divorced six years later. The British Paralympic Association said in a statement on Tuesday that Mills had decided to resign from British Disabled Ski Team (BDST), and thus give up any chance of being picked for Sochi. It added: ""Occasionally in sport equipment issues arise, especially with adaptive equipment and the interpretation of the rules in relation to its use. ""Therefore we are all saddened that she has decided to retire at this stage, rather than working with BDST and IPC Skiing to resolve the issue. ""Heather has shown determination and made great progress over the past few months and is to be commended for the success she's had in her skiing career.""","Heather Mills accused of verbally abusing an International Paralympic Official .

"(CNN) -- Charges against a police officer jailed in a two-state shooting rampage will be formally dropped Wednesday, a prosecutor said. Brian E. Dorian, 37, was to be released on his own recognizance Tuesday night, Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow announced. ""I feel horrible that Brian Dorian went through this,"" said Glasgow, adding that evidence at the time and identification in lineups merited the charges. ""At no time did we stop looking for exculpatory evidence."" A forensic analysis of Dorian's home computer and its activity put Dorian at home at the time of the shootings and verified his alibi, authorities said. The officer also told them he was watching sports programs and using e-mail. John Dorian, the officer's father, told CNN affiliate WLS he was ""relieved"" and ""never doubted his son."" Dorian's attorneys spoke only briefly Tuesday evening. ""He is relieved but concerned that someone is still out there who killed someone,"" said David Carlson. Dorian's boss at the Lynwood Police Department said the officer's ""reputation has been damaged and his family and fellow officers have been dragged through the mud."" The state's attorney owes the attack victims, their families, Dorian and Lynwood residents ""an apology for rushing to judgment thereby causing a great deal of pain and suffering for everyone involved,"" Chief Russell L. Pearson said in a statement Tuesday night. Earlier in the day, Dorian appeared in court via a hookup from the Will County Jail. He did not speak but an attorney entered a not guilty plea, WLS reported. Several friends and relatives wore T-shirts bearing the message ""Free Brian."" ""There's an innocent man sitting behind bars and somebody else is running around out there knowing that he got away with it. It's not fair,"" Jill Aggen, a friend of Dorian, told WLS. ""No doubt in my mind. He's not capable of it."" Dorian was arrested Friday in the killing of one person and the wounding of three others in the spree, which occurred south of Chicago, Illinois. He was held on a probable cause warrant, and bail was set at $2.5 million. Dorian, who according to WLS has been on medical leave for an injured shoulder the past year, was taken into custody Friday at his residence, said authorities. The shootings began about 10:30 a.m. October 5 at a construction site near Beecher, Illinois. The gunman killed one worker at the site and wounded two others, police have said. An hour later and about 10 miles away in Lowell, Indiana, authorities believe the same gunman opened fire again -- this time on a local farmer. Keith Dahl was shot in the left shoulder, arm and elbow, and then was robbed. Dahl told Lake County (Indiana) Sheriff's Detective Robert Martinez that the gunman approached him on his farm and started a conversation about bees before beginning to shoot. The gunman was believed to be using a revolver -- possibly a Colt .38-caliber or .357 Magnum -- because no shell casings were found at either scene, Lake County Sheriff Rogelio ""Roy"" Dominguez said.","Police officer will be freed in Illinois and Indiana shootings .

"(CNN) -- The Doors' founding keyboardist, Ray Manzarek, died in Germany Monday after a long fight with cancer, his publicist said in a statement. He was 74. The artist had been diagnosed with bile duct cancer. The Doors formed in 1965 after Manzarek happened to meet Jim Morrison on California's Venice Beach. The legendary rock group went on to sell 100 million albums worldwide, establishing five multiplatinum discs in the U.S. Morrison died in 1971, but Manzarek carried on The Doors' legacy, continuing to work as a musician and an author. ""I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my friend and bandmate Ray Manzarek today,"" said Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. ""I'm just glad to have been able to have played Doors songs with him for the last decade. Ray was a huge part of my life and I will always miss him."" The band famously defied Ed Sullivan's request that they not sing the lyric ""higher"" when they performed ""Light My Fire"" on his show in 1969. A show producer approached them in the dressing room shortly before they were to perform, Manzarek recalled in an interview with CNN in 2002. Manzarek remembers the band publicly agreeing like choirboys. "" 'Yes, sir,' we told him,"" he recalls. ""'Whatever you say, sir. We'll change.' (The producer) looked at Jim and said, 'You're the poet. Think of something else -- 'wire,' 'flyer.' "" Then the Doors went out and did the song exactly as they always did. Sullivan was so furious he didn't even shake their hands. Manzarek went on to produce the Los Angeles punk band X. Bassist John Doe said the band learned a lot from him. ""To have someone like Ray -- like rock 'n' roll royalty -- embrace what we do, it was great for our confidence,"" Doe told CNN in a 2004 interview. ""In the studio, he knew what to try to do. He went for performance. He was smart enough to realize that the band had the arrangements all worked out."" Manzarek is survived by his brothers Rick and James, his wife Dorothy, his son Pablo, and three grandchildren.

"(CNN) -- In 2003, former newspaper editor Ali Reza Eshraghi made a mistake that cost him his freedom: he published a cartoon. The sketch in question, a drawing from 1937 depicting U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt's pressure on the U.S. Supreme Court, seemed an innocuous choice for the Iranian newspaper, Hayat No. But Iran's Special Court for the Clergy disagreed. According to Reporters Without Borders it ruled that that the cartoon's depiction of Roosevelt looked suspiciously like the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini and was insulting to his memory. The court shut down Hayat No, and Eshraghi spent nearly two months in prison. A decade later, Eshraghi's friend and former colleague, journalist Omid Memarian, decided to honor the pressures placed on satirists in a book entitled, ""Sketches of Iran: A Glimpse from the Front Lines of Human Rights."" The book, published in January by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, was informed by Memarian's conviction that political cartoons played a unique role in his country's struggle for democracy. ""Over the past ten years I've been working as a journalist both in Iran and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions,"" he explained. ""Cartoons communicate with a much wider audience, with different layers of society, with people from different social economic class, with different levels of education."" Read more: Dubai cops get a 'Lambo' Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning lawyer, notes in her forward to the book that decades of censorship have also meant that the subtle, tongue-in-cheek wit of cartoonists takes on special power, writing that ""a society stricken by years of authoritarian rule cannot express itself and its pains in a straightforward manner."" Satire has long been used as a powerful medium for veiled political commentary and political cartoons became a favorite medium for poking fun at authorities. The satirical magazine ""Molla Nasreddin,"" an Azeri language periodical published between 1906 and 1930 enjoyed a wide readership across the Middle East. Its main character, a bumbling and backwards cleric often depicted in compromising scenarios, resonated with countries grappling with the thorny issue of modernization -- particularly Iran, where Molla Nasreddin's first year of publication coincided with the Constitutional Revolution, an attempt to reform Iran's monarchy. The country's first experiment with liberal democracy was ended in 1907, but Molla Nasreddin's jokes lived on inspiring future generations of artists who have used political cartoons to offer subtle social commentary for decades. ""The reasons cartoons... have a very strong presence in Iranian culture is that in some of these cycles of oppression journalists or authors could not write. But cartoonists might find ways to express an idea or in a very delicate way,"" said Memarian. Memarian believes cartoons have a unique ability to capture complex political problems in a succinct and visually powerful way, making them universally appealing.

""The scope for public expression has become much wider"" said Lina Khatib, director of the Arab Reform and Democracy Program at Stanford University. ""People feel much more empowered in being able to express how they feel about autocracy without the fear which used to force them to opt for subtlety."" Tarek Shahin, author of the graphic novel ""Rise: the Story of the Egyptian Revolution as Told Shortly Before It Began,"" agrees. ""As recently as three years ago just the fact that I wrote about politics and other social taboos had many of my friends and family worried about my safety and theirs by association,"" said Shahin. ""Today you can't keep up with all the political jokes, be they cartoons, internet memes or street graffiti."" Read more: Arab women directors find international acclaim . Self-expression is finding new forms, too. Dean Obeidallah, founder of the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival and a stand-up comedian who conducts workshops in the Middle East, said he has witnessed an explosion in the number of local comics in the region. But in Iran, according to Omid Memarian, many humorists have been forced to leave the country. ""Over the past seven to eight years, particularly over the past four years, many cartoonists -- like journalists -- have fled the country and live abroad,"" he said. ""They are under constant pressure to make sure their cartoons do not become a reason to harm the newspaper...There have been newspaper that have been shut down just for having a controversial cartoon."" Nonetheless, cartoonists in Iran are drawing on their creativity to evade censorship, which Memarian insists makes their work even more powerful. ""We're seeing actions become more ambiguous, more general, more interpretative,"" he said. ""(But) the process of decoding a message is more attractive. It's more appealing, more beautiful.""","Iranian cartoonists satirizing political system face great pressure .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Saturday's blast in that Asian nation's tribal region, an explosion at a food distribution point that killed at least 43 people and injured 90 others. Azam Tariq, the central spokesperson for Pakistani Taliban, told CNN in a phone call that it targeted people who had formed what he called a pro-government and anti-Taliban group. The blast took place about 600 meters from a U.N. World Food Programme distribution point at a security check post in Khar, according to Amjad Jamal, a spokesman for the agency. He said that more than 300 people were going through a security screening to get food and other items at the time of the explosion. Khar is the headquarters of Bajaur Agency, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan. Jamal said that those who had been internally displaced during military efforts in Bajaur Agency get a month's supply of food and other goods. Dr. Muhammad Hanif, a senior medical officer of Bajaur Agency's headquarters hospital in Khar, told CNN that 43 dead bodies and 90 injured people had been brought to the hospital. Jamal said all staff members of the World Food Programme and its partner organizations are safe, but added that all four of the program's food distribution points in Bajaur Agency have been temporarily closed for security reasons. Still, the U.N. agency will continue to provide services elsewhere in the country, Jamal said. Responding the question that whether the suicide bomber was a woman, the Pakistani Taliban's Azam Tariq said, ""We have thousands of male suicide bombers ready who are keenly waiting for their turns. Then why would we use a woman, which is against the traditions of Islam?"" U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement condemning Saturday's ""outrageous terrorist attack,"" which he called ""an affront to the people of Pakistan and to all humanity."" ""The United States stands with the people of Pakistan in this difficult time, and will strongly support Pakistan's efforts to ensure greater peace, security and justice for its people,"" Obama said. The blast took place a day after about 150 militants fired at five security checkpoints in Mohmand Agency -- another of the seven districts in Pakistan's volatile tribal region along the Afghan border -- killing 11 soldiers. Security forces later killed 40 militants who were among the group, authorities said Saturday. The security forces pounded militant hideouts in Mohmand Agency with helicopter gunships, said Maqsood Amin, a senior government official in the area. Twenty-four militants were killed during retaliation Friday while 16 were targeted Saturday.

"Paris (CNN) -- The attack on Chinese students in Hostens, a small town in the South-west of France, allegedly by a group of French youngsters, followed by the largest international wine fair, Vinexpo, in Bordeaux, where Chinese investors were very much present -- and active -- have triggered much talk in France about Chinese investment in the country's vineyards and a backlash against it. Over the past couple of years, there has been a significant rise of Chinese investment in French wines, notably Bordeaux wines. In line with this, China has recently become the first export market for Bordeaux wines. But Chinese investors seem to want more than being simple buyers. Many want wines to match their tastes and those of their fellow citizens. That's why they have started to invest in the well-known Chateaux brands, wine domains or wine trading companies. Whether they are buying the entire vineyard or only part of it, Chinese investors want to hold greater control over the final product. ""There are two groups of Chinese buyers,"" says Michael Baynes, an estate agent in Bordeaux. One is typically from Hong Kong where the people look ""for something smaller, something that is more for the passion of wine. And, although they are commercially minded, they are more interested in the wine product itself."" Baynes, co-founder of Maxwell-Storrie-Baynes (affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate), talks a bit differently about the mainland Chinese who ""will be thinking about all aspects of using the resource to make some maximized returns."" Peter Kwok fits almost perfectly in Bayne's first description. This businessman from Hong Kong bought the Chateau Haut-Brisson in 1997, in the Bordeaux village of Saint-Emilion. He has since then ""invested more and more to increase the quality and the size of the vineyard,"" says Charles Lemoine, in charge of wine marketing for Kwok. ""He comes three to five times a year,"" adds Lemoine, who describes Kwok as having a real passion for French wine. Indeed Kwok is not just a distant vineyard owner: his love for wine has become a family matter and his children are now very much involved in the business. So does this trend really come as a big surprise? French wine has always appealed to foreigners. The Belgians, Dutch, English, Americans, Swedes, etc. have been buying French vineyards for decades, if not centuries. Surely the fact that the Chinese are also starting to invest in these same lands should be a reflection of the global era, nothing more than that. For Jean-Pierre Rousseau, whose wine trading company Diva Bordeaux was the subject of a 70% investment purchase by Shanghai Sugar Cigarette and Wine, a subsidiary of Bright Food, a state-owned food group, the Chinese are looking for a sense of ""recognition"", one which he describes as ""social."" ""They are attracted to a European lifestyle, they are of course looking for expensive stuff and wine is part of that lifestyle"", he adds. Undoubtedly, the Chinese seek to invest in French vineyards for the reputation of the wines and their quality. In a way, owning French vineyards gives them credibility. There are even investors who seem to specifically target the Chateaux brands which sound very French such as the ""Lafite"" or the ""Latour"" names that are recognizable symbols of French culture. And the French appear receptive to Chinese investment in their wine, particularly in the Bordeaux region. Rousseau is himself enthusiastic about the Chinese coming to Bordeaux, ""they come here to learn, they come here to understand and when they bought some chateaux; they were rather positive in improving the quality."" The businessman also likes to wittingly remind people that ""in Bordeaux, we welcome them much better than (if) they are in Burgundy."" In fact, he has a point. When Chateau Gevrey-Chambertin was sold to a Chinese investor, the winegrowers of Burgundy were not impressed by the transaction and the manner in which it was handled. The head of the wine syndicate of Gevrey-Chambertin, Jean-Michel Guillon, expressed his disappointment saying that he and his winegrower colleagues were ""really sad to see that the only chateau of the 12th century -- with the Clos de Vougeot- will be acquired by a person foreign to the job."" Jean-Michel Guillon, who's been in the wine business for more than 30 years, explains that the purchase of this chateau may cause future and significant financial difficulties for the remaining winegrowers of the region. As the Chinese investor outbid local vintners to pay eight million euros -- more than double the estimated value of the property -- this will change the market prices for vineyards and, as Guillon indicates, taxes on succession rights to these properties will also rise significantly. But the selling of Gevrey-Chamberton has also caused discontent among local growers because of the nature of the region itself. Burgundy is a lot smaller in comparison to the Bordeaux wine region. So any purchase of a significant vineyard in Burgundy has a much greater impact on the region. Domains are very often a family affair; ""each winegrower is also a winemaker,"" says Guillon with a wholehearted voice. ""What would the Chinese say if Europeans started buying 10 or 20 meters of the Great Wall of China?"" asks the Burgundian, semi-smiling, semi-serious. But ultimately French wine inspires admiration among the Chinese, and the French have something to gain out of this. Plus, the Chinese are not ""buying everything""; in Bordeaux, where they invest the most, they have only acquired 1% of the whole wine lands. It's not exactly a huge loss.","Chinese investment flowing into France's vineyards, sparking backlash .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday to find a constitutional balance between free speech and privacy in a case involving provocative anti-homosexual protests by a small church at the funeral of a soldier who died in Iraq. Members of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church protested outside the court, while inside one of their members argued they have the right to promote what they call a broad-based message on public matters such as wars. But the lawyer for the fallen Marine's father argued those protests are an invasion of privacy and an intentional infliction of emotional distress. ""[Justice] Brandeis said the right to be let alone was the most important, and so he must have been thinking there could be a tort [lawsuit] there for interference with privacy,"" said Justice Stephen Breyer, speaking for many of his colleagues. ""And emotional injury, deliberately inflicted, could be one. ... But I see that in some instances that could be abused to prevent somebody from getting out a public message, and therefore, I'm looking for a line."" At issue is a delicate test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. Several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest. The church, led by pastor Fred Phelps, believes God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for dead soldiers,"" ""God blew up the troops"" and ""AIDS cures fags."" Westboro members had appeared outside the 2006 funeral for Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder in Westminster, Maryland, outside Baltimore. Snyder's family sued the church in 2007, alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy. A jury awarded the family $2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $8 million in punitive damages, which were later reduced to $5 million. The church appealed the case in 2008 to the 4th District, which reversed the judgments a year later, siding with the church's allegations that its First Amendment rights were violated. Albert Snyder, Matthew's father, said his son was not gay and the protesters should not have been at the funeral. ""I was just shocked that any individual could do this to another human being,"" Snyder told CNN. ""I mean, it was inhuman."" Church members say their broader message was aimed at the unspecified actions of the military and those who serve in it. They believe U.S. soldiers deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality. During Wednesday's intense one-hour arguments, the attorney for the Snyder side -- Sean Summers -- told the court the pain Albert Snyder suffered occurred before, during and after the funeral. That included a posting on the Westboro website that offered what Summers said were more intense personal attacks on the Snyders than may have occurred at the burial service. ""But it does not intrude upon the funeral,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""He doesn't have to watch them. They are just posted on the Internet."" ""Why does he have a claim?"" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The protest ""was at considerable distance. There was no importuning anyone going to the funeral. It stopped before the funeral -- the service -- began."" She added that the Westboro members stayed on public rights-of-way, had the permission of police to gather, and were not arrested. Summers, however, reiterated the church crossed the line. ""I believe that the justices heard that and I hope that they realize that this isn't just a case about speech, it's about harassment, targeted harassment at a private person's funeral,"" Summers said afterward. In an unususal twist, the attorney representing the church before the Supreme Court is also a church member -- Margie Phelps, a daughter of the pastor. She held her own under sometimes withering questioning from several justices, especially over whether the church's ""speech"" is personal or public in nature. ""Suppose someone believes that African-Americans are inherently inferior, and they are really a bad influence on this country,"" Justice Samuel Alito said. ""And so a person comes up to an African-American and starts berating that person with racial hatred. Now is this just any old old African-American on the street? That's a matter of public concern?"" Chief Justice John Roberts said, ""Does it make a difference, which seems to me to be the case here, that Mr. Snyder was selected not because of who he was, but because it was a way to get maximum publicity for your client's particular message?"" Margie Phelps countered her fellow congregants did not stalk or confront Snyder or his family. ""The words that were at issue in this case were people from a church delivering a religious viewpoint,"" she said, ""commenting not only on the broader public issues that the discussion was under way in this nation about dying soldiers, about the morals of the nation."" Ginsburg jumped in, noting Westboro had picketed the Maryland state Capitol the same day, just before going to the Snyder funeral. ""This is a case about exploiting a private family's grief,"" she said, ""and the question is: Why should the First Amendment tolerate exploiting this Marine's family when you have so many other forums for getting across your message,"" such as standing in front of the Supreme Court. About a dozen congregants, including a couple of young children, did just that Wednesday, gathering in front of the court building to hold signs, sing hymns, and shout their message. They planned later to promote their message at nearby Arlington National Cemetery. They had been at the White House and other sites the day before. The Supreme Court has never addressed the specific issues of laws designed to protect the ""sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services,"" as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased. But the high court has recognized the state's interest in protecting people from unwanted protests or communications while in their homes. The justices are being asked to address how far states and private entities like cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket-free zones and the use of ""floating buffers"" to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting. A majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the Westboro church protesters. In Wednesday's case, 48 states and dozens of members of Congress filed an amicus brief in support of the Snyders. Church members told the court they have a duty to protest and picket at certain events, including funerals, to promote their religious message: ""That God's promise of love and heaven for those who obey him in this life is counterbalanced by God's wrath and hell for those who do not obey him."" The congregation is made up mostly of Fred Phelps and his family. The pastor has 13 children, and at least 54 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He described himself as an ""old-time"" gospel preacher in a CNN interview in 2006, saying, ""You can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God."" Church members have participated in several hundred protests across the country. Last  year, the high court blocked Missouri's effort to enforce a specific law aimed at the Westboro church. Phelps, daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper and other church members had protested near the August 2005 funeral of a soldier in St. Joseph, Missouri. State lawmakers later passed the ""Spc. Edward Lee Myers Law,"" criminalizing picketing ""in front of or about"" a funeral location or procession. The case heard Wednesday is Snyder v. Phelps (09-751). A ruling is expected in the next few months. CNN's Kamal Wallace and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Justices question both sides on rights in free speech/privacy case .

"(CNN) -- A controversial law requiring adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screening has gone into effect in Florida. Saying it is ""unfair for Florida taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction,"" Gov. Rick Scott signed the legislation in June. ""It's the right thing for taxpayers,"" Scott said after signing the measure. ""It's the right thing for citizens of this state that need public assistance. We don't want to waste tax dollars. And also, we want to give people an incentive to not use drugs."" Under the law, which went into effect on Friday, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services will be required to conduct the drug tests on adults applying to the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. The aid recipients would be responsible for the cost of the screening, which they would recoup in their assistance if they qualify. Those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children. Shortly after the bill was signed, five Democrats from the state's congressional delegation issued a joint statement attacking the legislation, one calling it ""downright unconstitutional."" And the ACLU has filed suit against the state for requiring all state workers to take a drug test and is considering suing the state for drug-testing welfare applicants. Controversy over the measure was heightened by Scott's past association with a company he co-founded that operates walk-in urgent care clinics in Florida and counts drug screening among the services it provides. In April, Scott, who had transferred his ownership interest in Solantic Corp. to a trust in his wife's name, said the company would not contract for state business, according to local media reports. He subsequently sold his majority stake in the company, local media reported. On May 18, the Florida Ethics Commission ruled that two conflict-of-interest complaints against Scott were legally insufficient to warrant investigation, and adopted an opinion that no ""prohibited conflict of interest"" existed. Florida is not the first state to pass such legislation. Michigan passed a similar law that the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals found unconstitutional in 2003 since it violated the U.S. Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens against unreasonable search. The court said the law would set a dangerous precedent by allowing the government to conduct drug searches for the safety of the public without prior suspicion. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Gov. Rick Scott says the measure saves tax dollars and provides ""incentive to not use drugs""

"(CNN) -- China's plan to guarantee its economic future depends on empowering and enriching the most downtrodden of its citizens: migrant workers. These are the approximately 250 million people from the countryside that now live and work in Chinese cities but they cannot access government healthcare, education and other social services once they leave their home villages and towns. These migrants are handcuffed by the Soviet-inspired ""hukou"" system of housing registration. Introduced in the 1950s, it aimed to prevent farmers and peasants from flooding into the cities and during the Mao years such a move was nearly impossible. Since reforms began in 1980, however, the government has allowed farmers to migrate to the cities to fill jobs at factories, construction sites, restaurants, hotels, shopping centers and the like. This population of migrant workers is now estimated to consititute as much as 25% of the residents of major Chinese cities today. Just over 50% of China's 1.3 billion people now live in cities, as compared to some 20% when reforms began in 1980. The United States hit the 50% mark in 1920. Britain became majority urban in 1850. China's future growth depends on ""hukou"" reform to make these people legal urban residents and turn them into the next wave of consumers . The reason is that the current economic model is running out of gas. The model -- based on state enterprises and driven by loose credit and government spending on infrastructure -- must be transformed into an economy driven by consumers. When the new Communist Party leadership of President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang came into office a year ago, consumption was only about 35% of GDP, as compared to 54% in India and nearly 75% in the U.S. The existing urban population -- with legal housing registration -- mostly have done well in the past couple of decades. Many have already splurged on apartments, cars and large electronics. They alone can't drive the level of consumption the Chinese economy will require going forward. The ""China 2030"" report published by the World Bank and the Development Research Center, a Chinese think tank that advises the leadership, said that if China can provide legal urban housing registration for 10 million migrant workers a year and transform them into the next wave of consumers, then China can enjoy 6% annual growth for the next couple of decades. This World Bank report also estimates that China will have from 13 million to 15 million people per year moving from the countryside to cities for the next couple of decades. A huge challenge for China's leadership is developing a sustainable urban development model. For the past 20 years, city planning and urbanization has been driven by real estate sales that funded city governments and enriched well-connected property developers. The government owns all the land in China and only property usage rights change hands. So city planners have focused on turning rural land into urban land so it could be developed. All too often this was done by constructing ring roads around cities to delineate ever larger areas for development. A serious consequence of this model is heavy pollution, tangled traffic and urban designs that favor massive developments instead of housing, workplaces, education and recreation facilities that are organized around how people live and work and socialize. Demographers and planners in China are now debating the best models for future development. These include encircling China's existing metropolises with satellite cities in a hub-and-spoke pattern that would allow migrants to live an hour away with legal housing registration. The government's current five-year plan designates 20 such centers of urbanization. This includes the five cities that have the same status as China's provinces -- Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Chongqing -- as well as such ""regional centers"" as Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, Xian, Shenyang and Shenzhen. In the Pearl River Delta inland from Hong Kong, China plans to spend $350 billion to mesh together nine cities with a population of 50 million. The views expressed in this article are solely those of James McGregor .","China's economic future depends on empowering migrant workers .

"(CNN) -- It's clear that we can't go 24 hours without Sarah Palin saying something so stupid that it defies logic, but leave it to the Kim Kardashian of politics to find something wrong with first lady Michelle Obama's effort to curb obesity in America's kids. In a radio interview on Wednesday with conservative talker Laura Ingraham, Palin took dead aim at the first lady's ""Let's Move"" initiative, which is all about getting children active and involved in exercise and healthy eating. In the wacky world of Wasilla's finest, Palin tries to cast the effort to fight obesity as part of Michelle Obama's ""different worldview."" Here is a portion of the transcript from HuffingtonPost.com: ""Take her anti-obesity thing that she is on. She is on this kick, right. What she is telling us is she cannot trust parents to make decisions for their own children, for their own families in what we should eat. ""And I know I'm going to be again criticized for bringing this up, but instead of a government thinking that they need to take over and make decisions for us according to some politician or politician's wife priorities, just leave us alone, get off our back and allow us as individuals to exercise our own God-given rights to make our own decisions and then our country gets back on the right track."" Hmmm. ""Let's Move"" is Obama's ""kick?"" Maybe someone should kick Sarah Palin so she can understand how devastating obesity is to the future of the United States. According to the first lady's ""Let's Move"" website: . • Obesity rates among children have tripled in the last three decades, and one in three children are obese. • One-third of all children born after 2000 will suffer from diabetes. • Children are less active today than at any other time in American history, spending 7.5 hours a day watching TV, playing video games or simply involved in efforts that don't require movement. • Obesity is contributing to the vast increase in hypertension among Americans. Now, since Palin is always talking about our nation's military and how we have to honor them and show them love and affection, let's listen to what a group of generals said a few months ago about obesity and America's national defense. A study released in April by Mission: Readiness, a nonprofit group of more than 150 retired generals and admirals, concluded that 27 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds are too fat to join the military. The culprit? Junk food and too much fat in school lunches. Said the study: ""Today, otherwise excellent recruiting prospects, some of them with generations of sterling military service in their family history, are being turned away because they are just too overweight. Our standards are high because we clearly cannot have people in our command who are not up to the job. Too many lives depend on it."" In testimony before Congress, the former head of the California Army National Guard, retired U.S. Army Major Gen. Paul Monroe, said that ""80 percent of children who were overweight between the ages of 10 to 15 were obese by age 25."" He and other military leaders want Congress to enact a massive child nutrition bill to remove all junk food and high-calorie beverages from schools, improve nutrition standards in schools, upgrade school menus and, the group said, ""help develop new school-based strategies, based on research, that help parents and children adopt healthier lifelong eating and exercise habits."" Monroe testified: ""In 1946, Congress passed the National School Lunch Act as a matter of national security. In the past, retired admirals and generals have stood up to make it clear that America is only as healthy as our nation's children. Childhood obesity is now undermining our national security and we need to start turning it around today."" So, Sarah Palin, are you going to also rip into this decorated American and say that he and 150 other military leaders are dead wrong? I recently sat down with Michelle Obama for a prime time special on TV One cable network dedicated to her ""Let's Move"" initiative. It was startling to listen to her talk about the horrible statistics and the shape we'll be in in the future, figuratively and literally. ""The crisis that we're facing around childhood obesity hits everything,"" Obama said. ""It's about education, what our kids are learning about nutrition in the schools, the quality of the food in the schools. It's about our neighborhood development. How are neighborhoods designed? ""Are our kids -- do they have access to safe places to play? Are we structuring communities in a way that facilitates healthy living? Are there accessible and affordable healthy foods in our communities? And it's about economic opportunity as well, because if folks can't afford to put food on the table, then they're eating what they can. ""So this is one of those issues that requires us to talk about a little bit of everything. And it makes us look at ourselves a little more closely and it makes us look at the broader society. So we're beginning to understand this is a threat."" This latest broadside by Palin shows how reckless and ridiculous she is. Libertarians and far right conservative Republicans are always talking about government intrusion into our lives, but when we look at clean water, air quality and food supply, thank God for governmental standards. Don't think for a second I'm not paying attention. I've increased my health awareness, am changing my diet and working out more to lose weight, and am pushing family members to do the same. That's really the whole point of Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move."" Any Republican with common sense should see that Sarah Palin poses an immediate threat to the future of this country. She proves that every time she opens her mouth. Sarah, for the benefit of the nation, stick a fork in it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin says Sarah Palin slammed Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" anti-obesity campaign .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing of a mosque in Rawalpindi and vowed to carry out more attacks, according to an e-mail message from the group. The assault targeted a mosque frequented by Pakistani military personnel, and killed 36 and wounded 75, the military said. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan took responsibility for the action on Friday but reiterated its claim in an e-mail to CNN on Saturday because media outlets quoted analysts and some officials who doubted the group's participation. Watch a report about the attack . ""We reconfirmed it, that the TTP has done it, and will do more which are already planned,"" the group said. ""We once again mention that we are not against the innocent people and the state of Pakistan but against those officers and ministers who are American by hearts and minds and Pakistani just by faces,"" the e-mail message said. Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed the mosque in Rawalpindi, and most of the victims were children. The attack was the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The children keep asking when their mother is coming home. Lee Khim Fatt doesn't know what to tell them. It's been more than three weeks since his wife, a flight attendant on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, disappeared along with 238 others when the jet vanished mid-flight. ""I told them mummy's going to take a bit longer to come home this time, and I even promised them I'm going to bring her home,"" Lee says. His eyes fill with tears as he explains his plight. It's a promise he's not sure he can keep. ""I really don't know where she is now,"" he says, ""and now I am not sure whether I could bring her home."" Lee and his wife, Foong Wai Yueng, shared a happy life together, raising their 10-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son. They met 20 years ago when she was just 19. He was her first boyfriend. Without her, Lee says he's lost his direction. An 18-year Malaysia Airlines veteran, she loved to fly around the world. The destinations were different, he says, but her returns home were always the same. ""Every time she came back, definitely she got something for the kids,"" he says. ""This is what she loved to do."" Quest for answers . Dozens of anguished relatives Sunday demanded that Malaysian authorities provide them with evidence of the fate of their loved ones aboard the missing Boeing 777. ""We want evidence, we want truth and we want our family,"" they chanted at a news conference outside a Kuala Lumpur hotel. While many of the passengers' families are staying together in hotels, Lee remains at his home waiting for information about the missing flight. On Sunday, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turned up fresh potential clues as an Australian aircraft spotted four orange objects in the water. But investigators haven't yet confirmed whether the objects were from the airliner, which officials believe went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Lee said he hears from Malaysia Airlines just once or twice a day, by phone or text message. He's angry at how the airline has handled the ordeal. Even though his wife was part of the cabin crew, he says he gets more information from the media than the airline. He watches the near-daily press conferences on television. ""The airline management only call us or have some briefing with us, you know, and then they tell us the same thing again as what the press conference told,"" he complained. His frustration has led in part to his decision to hire a Chicago-based law firm. They've filed a petition on his behalf, seeking records from Boeing and Malaysia Airlines. Amid the confusion, Malaysia said it has done its best with what it has. ""History will judge us as a country that has been very responsible,"" Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transportation minister, said. The waiting for the families has not been easy. Lee wants the truth about what happened to MH370. He wants something to tell his daughter, when she asks what happened to her mother. Most of all he wants his wife to come home. ""Of course I'm still hoping for god's miracles,"" he says. Families turn grief into action . CNN's Steve Almasy and Catherine E.

"Washington (CNN)  -- It was one of those behind-the-scenes moments that a reporter covering the Tea Party rarely gets to witness. About 1:35 a.m. Thursday, a man ran up to a Tea Party Express bus, approaching from the left, waving his arms and shouting something that none of us on the bus could understand. I was sitting in the ""sidekick seat,"" a leather perch near the driver with a clear view. The three-bus caravan had just rolled into Washington, hours ahead of the final rally of the ""Just Vote them Out"" tour -- the movement's third national event since coming together a little over a year ago. The bus I was on carried about 14 weary travelers: Tea Party leaders and activists, journalists and Casey the dog, a small girl with floppy ears belonging to Tea Party Express Chairman Mark Williams. We had just arrived after a grueling trip from Boston, Massachusetts, where Sarah Palin rallied a crowd of thousands on Boston Common, and were blocks away from our destination. The bus was hard to miss, wrapped full-on in a Tea Party advertisement. Apparently, just the sight of it made the man angry. As he rushed us, shouting all the way, the bus driver cautiously slid open his window. ""This country is at war,"" the man screamed into the slightly opened window. The driver quickly slammed it shut. No one on the bus, including me, could understand what point the man was trying to make. The activists dismissed him as a drunk. But one thing was very clear: The Tea Party had once again attracted attention from one of its many critics. In fact, the Tea Party movement has earned plenty of detractors as it has traveled cross-country labeling President Obama a ""socialist"" and blasting what it says is big government run amok, while invoking the Constitution's sanctity. Agitators have thrown eggs at the buses. Ray March, one of the drivers, told me that a semi-truck driver tried to run his bus off the road. Now there was a late-night ranting as the conservative activists rolled into the nation's reliably liberal capital. On the drive to Washington, the activists had aimed their ire at cable news channels, news sites or blogs they felt were biased against the Tea Party movement. They praised outlets they felt cast the movement in its right light. From what I saw, the bus' TV system was tuned to one news outlet in particular. Hint: It wasn't CNN. As for creature comforts, space was a commodity. Seating was at a premium. Virtually every seat was spoken for. Four bunk beds were loaded with stuff. One guy slept on the floor next to one of them, in the middle of the narrow walkway that attached the front of the bus to the back. Everyone stepped over him to get by. Work spaces were virtually nonexistent, with laptops and BlackBerrys competing for space with kitsch and curling irons. Hanging over the toilet in the cramped bathroom was a sign with a stern warning: ""Liquids only."" Every once in awhile, a refrigerator would fly open -- spilling items out. Still, despite the long trip, tempers never flared and pleasant conversation was not hard to find. The activists seemed to get along with each other and were accommodating to journalists. I mostly sat in the front of the bus. But I also spent time in the back, working out of a cramped space with the other journalists embedded for the trip. Crammed into a U-shaped area with a small desk slab, we all did our work: I wrote stories, an editor and reporter team from Los Angeles-based Pajamas TV did on-camera reports and a Fox News radio reporter did live spots. He scripted a line about Tea Partiers ""partying like it was 1773"" in one of them, a reference to the year of the original Boston Tea Party. We all laughed at that one. In the front of the bus, Casey was lounging comfortably. The pooch sat on one of the leather bench sofas along the window for most of the trip. It was a nice spot, considering that our Boston to Washington trip, expected to take about 7 hours, actually took more than 10 hours. Multiple bathroom breaks and food stops had prolonged the trip. At one point, as I was interviewing Williams, he mentioned Casey, put a laptop in front of her, and said she likes to blog from the bus.","CNN's Shannon Travis travels with Tea Party Express Thursday night .

"(CNN) -- Five blasts went off in the Nigerian city of Jos Friday night as residents were celebrating Christmas Eve, leaving 31 dead, a regional government official said. Choji Gyang, a special adviser to the governor of Nigeria's Plateau state, said two bombs went off in the Angwa Rukuba area of Jos. Within five to 20 minutes, three more blasts happened in the area of Kabong, he said. ""We have a lot of casualties and are struggling to cope,"" Gyang said. Hassan John, a Jos resident and journalist with the media department of the Anglican Diocese of Jos, had just come out of church about 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) when he heard the sound of the first explosion. He rushed to the site, which he described as a beer parlor frequented by locals. ""By the time I got there, there were women crying, people screaming. It was all chaos, people were screaming, blood everywhere."" ""I counted eight corpses all over, seven in the building,"" John said. He added that a second blast went off within a couple of minutes after the first one. ""We cannot say if there are more bodies under the rubble because it was dark,"" John said. Gyang, who is special adviser on religious affairs to the governor, said it was unclear who set off the blasts or whether they were related. ""It was Christmas Eve, lots of activities was going on. People were still preparing for Christmas, lots of people were coming into town. A blast went off, those around the area -- some were killed, some injured and the houses and cars caught fire,"" Gyang said. He said he received reports of ""a lot of dead bodies."" ""The way they went off was in the same manner. They all went to where people were concentrated,""Gyang said. Several injured people were taken to a local hospital while some who were not severely injured left the scene on their own. John said the beer-parlor scene was chaotic as residents, especially young men, became agitated over the lack of security in what has been a volatile area. Hundreds of people from both faiths have died in violence between Christians and Muslims in Nigeria in the past decade. ""Soldiers fired a couple of rounds into the air because a riot was developing,"" John said. The first blasts occurred just a few buildings away from a police station and a military checkpoint, according to both Gyang and John. Gyang said that during the preceding two days, a special task force that had been sent to the Plateau state by the federal government had gone on radio telling residents to go about their business and not to worry about the security situation in the area. The government had increased security and checkpoints throughout the past week, including additional a patrols in various areas of Jos, Gyang said . ""Five different bombs blasts in the heart of Jos. This is the height of insecurity in this city,"" Gyang said. ""There is a lapse in security, specifically by the special task force,"" he said. ""They have not been doing what they were expected to and as a result we had these attacks."" In recent weeks, the governor's office had received letters purported to be from some Muslim organizations threatening attacks against Christians, Gyang said. ""The security officials didn't take the threat letters seriously. They were thought of as gimmicks, and at the end of the day, they became reality.""","Five blasts hit the city of Jos, a government official in Nigeria says .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of the Senate Nancy Erickson has rejected Roland Burris' appointment to the Senate, an aide to the secretary told CNN. Roland Burris says Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's problems have nothing to do with him. Erickson rejected Burris' appointment because his certificate of appointment was missing the signature of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, the aide said Monday. Rule 2 of the Standing Rules of the Senate states that the secretary of state must sign the certificate of election along with the governor. White has declined to sign the certificate, siding with some Senate Democrats who say Burris should not be seated because of the cloud over Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is accused of trying to sell President-elect Barack Obama's Senate seat. The embattled governor last week appointed Burris to fill the seat. According to a Democratic source and a Democratic Senate leadership aide, without the signed certificate, Burris will be denied access to the Senate floor. But Burris insists he has the legal right to serve as senator and has said he will appear at the Senate's door Tuesday.  Watch what Burris says about the appointment » . ""I am going [to Washington] to be seated. I am the junior senator from the state of Illinois -- that's all I can say,"" he said Monday at an airport news conference in Chicago, Illinois, before leaving for Washington. He said he is not bothered by controversy surrounding his appointment by Blagojevich because ""the appointment is legal."" Pressed by reporters on what he would do if he is refused admission to the Senate floor, Burris said, ""If I am turned away, my lawyers will take it from there, and we'll see what happens."" He said he has not been contacted by anyone from the Obama team, and he insisted that he is not upset at the situation surrounding his appointment. ""I'm not angry with anybody,"" Burris said. ""In fact, I'm enjoying this on behalf of the people of Illinois."" In an interview Monday with Wolf Blitzer for CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" Burris downplayed the issue of a missing signature on the certificate of appointment. ""We know that under Illinois law and constitutional law that the secretary of state can in no way veto legal action of the governor,"" Burris said. ""So that signature is only perfunctory and ceremonial to put the seal on it for, you know, recording and filing purposes."" One possible compromise being considered by some in the Senate Democratic leadership would be allowing Burris to be seated in the Senate so long as he agrees not to run in 2010. A senior Democratic source familiar with Senate leadership deliberations said a Democratic concern about seating Burris is that his association with Blagojevich would make him so tainted that he would lose the Democratic seat if he ran in the next election. The compromise would clear the field for other Democratic candidates that the leadership considers more viable to run in 2010. Democratic sources cautioned that this is just one idea being discussed and that the Democratic leadership hasn't formally settled on making the offer to Burris. The source familiar with the deliberations said one key to this compromise, and a way around declarations that anyone Blagojevich appoints is tainted, would be to give the Burris appointment political legitimacy by having Illinois Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn publicly endorse it. Asked about the possibility of agreeing not to run in 2010, Burris told reporters, ""I can't negotiate in the press."" Senate Democratic leaders have scheduled a meeting with Burris Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday said lawmakers have the legal authority to block Burris' appointment, but Reid has also left open the possibility that Burris could be seated. ""Let's just wait and see and when we have something real, we'll deal with it,"" he said, adding that Burris will ""not be allowed on the floor"" until his appointment is certified. He dismissed the idea of Burris not running in 2010, saying, ""I think that would not be a good deal to me."" Burris said he will meet with Reid on Wednesday. ""I will tell him I'm here to take my seat,"" he said. Burris, 71, is one of Illinois' most accomplished African-American politicians. Senate leaders questioning the appointment cite Article 1, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution, which states, ""Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members."" Those leaders say the problem is that the pick was made by the potentially tainted governor; the problem isn't Burris himself.

"(CNN) -- Every non-democratic government faces the following problem: when they tell the truth, everyone thinks it is a lie. Recently, the new leadership of the Chinese government has launched one of the most intense anti-corruption campaigns in decades to, as President Xi Jinping put it, fight both ""flies"" and ""tigers."" Bo Xilai, a former Politburo member and the biggest ""tiger"" so far that has fallen from grace, was sentenced to life in prison on Sunday. Yet very few outside observers believe that this marks a success in the anti-corruption campaign; many argue that this is a political purge against a potential rival to the new regime. It is difficult to know how many ordinary Chinese citizens feel the same way, but as the old Chinese saying goes, ""every new sovereign brings his own courtiers."" That is to say, people understand how politics works. The suspicion among the masses of the true intention of the government poses a major challenge to China's recent efforts to curb corruption. If the anti-graft drive was designed to create a better image of the Communist Party and make the Chinese people happy, what if the people don't believe it is sincere? Considering the huge costs of the campaign, is it really worthwhile if people consider this as just another round of political reshuffling to consolidate the new leaders' power? Read more: China's Bo Xilai appeals conviction . The costs are substantial: just imagine how much human and financial resources it took to investigate, arrest, adjudicate and imprison a high-ranking official, let alone the time it cost for the leadership to reach a consensus. The 18th National Party Congress, a key meeting that began the once-in-a-decade leadership change, was delayed for about a month in late 2012 in the wake of the Bo Xilai scandal. However, the biggest cost comes from the fact that an intense campaign like this harms solidarity among the nation's elite -- the key to the survival of single-party regimes. This presents the greatest dilemma of anti-corruption campaigns in any non-democratic regime. Should they fight against corruption sincerely to avoid being overthrown by the masses but risk being assassinated by a desperate comrade in a coup from the inside? Should they launch a seemingly strong campaign to selectively crack down on some politicians to maintain elite unity but irritate the public? The Chinese government seems to have chosen the second strategy because, first, they care more about elite solidarity and, second, people are cynical any way. Historical evidence is supportive of this. Anti-corruption campaigns have arrived in waves: the late 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s and today. Big ""tigers"" have been arrested in each wave: Chen Xitong (former Beijing Party chief) in 1995, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison but released in 2006 due to health concerns. Chen Liangyu, the former Shanghai Party chief, was suspended from the Party in 2006 and eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison on bribery and corruption charges. And now Bo Xilai, the former Chongqing Party chief -- it is no coincidence that these waves occurred around leadership changes. Bad policies are good politics. The Chinese Communist Party has had very few instances of elite split in the last 90 years since it was founded in 1921 because they figured that elite cohesion is far more important than public support in sustaining their rule. However, this strategy will not solve the dilemma forever. An empowered and enlightened public has increasingly threatened non-democratic regimes, as the Arab Spring revealed. To have a long-term plan, the Chinese Communist Party needs to institute strong institutions such as The Independent Commission Against Corruption in Hong Kong or an independent judiciary to check the power of the Party and the government. It might be a pain in the short-run, but it will bring longevity to the Party.","Wang: The recent corruption crackdown creates problems for China's political elite .

"(Mashable)  -- Facebook Photos, one of the social network's most popular features, is getting a big and potentially controversial upgrade with a new feature that automatically suggests who users should tag in photos based on facial recognition technology. The new feature, Tag Suggestions, will begin rolling out to U.S. users next week, according to Facebook Vice President of Product Chris Cox. He told us that the product utilizes technology that was built in-house, as well as some technology that came from partners. Cox did not disclose the partners Facebook worked with for Tag Suggestions, although we have our suspicions. Tag Suggestions is fairly straightforward. Whenever you're offered the chance to tag groups of your friends in an album, Facebook will utilize its facial recognition technology to group similar faces together and automatically suggest the friend you should tag them with. Facebook fills in the ""Who is this?"" box with its suggestion -- all you have to do is click the ""Save Tags"" button to accept. Cox says that suggestions will only appear when its algorithms have ""high confidence"" of who's being suggested. Unlike Face.com, Facebook doesn't reveal its certainty level and wouldn't reveal what percentage actually correlates to ""high confidence."" The social giant is also preemptively addressing the potential privacy issues that will be brought up from automatic, algorithmic tagging. Users can opt out of Tag Suggestions by going to their privacy settings and disabling the ""Suggest photos of me to friends"" feature. This release is part of a bigger effort to upgrade Photos. Earlier this year, Facebook launched a slew of upgrades, including bigger thumbnails, group tagging and drag-and-drop photos. This may be the biggest upgrade for Photos yet, though. Photo tagging is considered a chore by many users, yet it is the company's most popular product. ""Photos are by far the most engaging content Facebook has ever had,"" Cox told us earlier today. By vastly simplifying the tagging process, Facebook expects that its millions of users will tag more photos, which will create millions of new engagement points and social connections, making it that much more addicting. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A vast majority of 2,500 Afghan elders voted Sunday at a traditional gathering to recommend a joint security agreement with the United States. Members attending the 4-day-long loya jirga urged President Hamid Karzai to sign it before the end of the year. Thousands of tribal elders made their way to the capital to join the loya jirga, a grand assembly, to confer on the key issue of whether or not to support the presence in their country of a limited number of U.S. troops beyond next year. Amid some skepticism, they decided it was a good idea. U.S. Secretary of state John Kerry, who finished hammering out the deal with Karzai the day before the loya jirga began, was hopeful that they would. The assembly's decision is not binding, but Karzai has said he will follow their recommendation under one condition -- that U.S. forces do not conduct house raids. ""If US military forces conduct military operations on Afghan homes even one more time, then there will be no BSA and we won't sign it,"" Karzai said Sunday. ""They should give assurance about this to us before I sign it."" Home raids have been one of the main sore spots between Afghans and Western military presence led by the United States. In spite of the broad backing, elders wanted to see one article changed. The current agreement gives the United States full jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed by the military on Afghan soil. Many at the loya jirga would like to see the cases prosecuted on U.S. bases in Afghanistan, so that victims and their families may have their say in court. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Afghans want alleged crimes by U.S. soldiers prosecuted at U.S. bases on their soil .

"(CNN) -- The Saudi lawyer who represented a gang rape victim had his disciplinary hearing for ""insulting the Supreme Judicial Council and disobeying the rules and regulations"" of the judiciary postponed to an unspecified date, according to The Associated Press. Abdul Rahman al-Lahem: ""I believe I didn't do anything wrong."" His client is a teenage rape victim who was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for violating the kingdom's strict Islamic law by being alone with an unrelated man before the rape. The attacks took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was 18 and engaged to be married. Her seven rapists were sentenced to between two to nine years in prison. Before the reported postponement Wednesday, Abdul Rahman al-Lahem said the rape case had elicited a fierce response, including calls for his beheading. ""These opinions don't scare me, but they make me feel a disappointment that there are people who think this way. ""I wish that those who oppose me could engage in a direct dialogue instead of calling for violence. Unfortunately, they are still stuck in a culture of closed-mindedness."" Ahead of the postponement Al-Lahem, who has two daughters, predicted he would have his revoked license to practice law reinstated and said he would represent the Saudi woman again.  The hearing has the power to disbar him. ""I believe in the system and the law, and I believe I didn't do anything wrong,"" Abdul Rahman al-Lahem told CNN in a telephone interview from Riyadh on Tuesday. The Saudi judge who revoked al-Lahem's license last month did so to punish him for speaking to the media about his client, al-Lahem said. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. In challenging his possible suspension and disbarment, the 36-year-old attorney said he has received threats on his life from the religious right. But the foreign minister's call for a review of the case -- joined by ""many voices"" of al-Lahem's generation, as he put it -- have been encouraging, he added. ""Young people in all fields are asking for reform, in the judicial system, media and elsewhere,"" he said. ""I belong to a new generation of lawyers who know the law and know how to challenge judges about the law."" He said his opponents' influence is on the wane. ""They believe that any criticism of the judiciary system is a direct criticism of the Islamic Sharia law, and they consider that any criticism is a criticism of religion itself,"" he said. Al-Lahem singled out the chief judge in the Qatif Court's panel of three judges who revoked his license as being among those who fail to grasp that the world is changing. ""He's used to lawyers who accept everything he says without questioning. I told him 'You misunderstood the law, your honor' and he couldn't take that."" Al-Lahem said that, from the early 1990s until a few years ago, he was a religious fanatic. But he said he rejected extremism during law school and joined with the reformists, accepting human rights cases on a pro bono basis in addition to the commercial work that pays his bills. The rape victim's husband, who has been outspoken in her defense, moved al-Lahem to accept her case, he said. ""I would be disgraced if I sit back and don't support these people who need me,"" he said. Al-Lahem described the woman's case as unusual only in the attention it has garnered, attention he welcomes. ""One such case is better than thousands of speeches, lectures and theoretical articles,"" he said. Such cases ""speak on behalf of the street and reached out to the ordinary people. This is my main reason for defending them."" Though traditionalist judges and conservative lawyers accuse him of harming the kingdom's image by talking to the media, young people and reformists have offered their support, especially over the Internet, ""where people are free to express their views,"" al-Lahem said. ""The world is now a small village,"" he said. ""What is happening in a small room can be known within seconds to the whole world."" This is not the lawyer's first challenge to Saudi ways. He also represented a professor accused of holding views that offended Islam. ""I defended him, and the king personally intervened"" on his behalf, al-Lahem said. In another case, he sued the religious police, also known as the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, after they kidnapped a woman and beat her, ""and then we proved that she was innocent.""

"London (CNN) -- More than 700 years after William Wallace died fighting for Scottish independence, and more than 300 years after Scotland and England came together in a United Kingdom, a new agreement could lead to an independent Scotland. British Prime Minister David Cameron and his Scottish counterpart, First Minister Alex Salmond, signed a deal in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Monday paving the way for Scots to vote on independence from the United Kingdom, Cameron's office announced on Twitter. The referendum, expected to be held in 2014, would allow Scots a straight yes-or-no vote on staying in the union. The ""Yes Scotland"" campaign launched in May, trying to ""build a groundswell of support for an independent Scotland,"" with the backing of several famous Scots, most notably actor Sean Connery. Salmond and his Scottish National Party (SNP), which holds power in the Scottish parliament, have pushed for the vote. A survey released last week by TNS-BMRB showed that only 28% of Scots favor leaving the United Kingdom. That's somewhat in line with an Ipsos MORI poll of 1,002 Scots, taken in late August, that showed sharp political differences within Scotland. That survey showed that more than 60% of SNP supporters desire full independence. However, only about a third of all the Scots polled wanted to break away from the United Kingdom. Some detractors have expressed concern about Scotland's economic viability as an independent state. But oil from the North Sea, off the Scottish coast, has enriched the United Kingdom for decades. And the SNP, on its website, says independence ""could create an environment where our existing and new private industries can grow more easily,"" and the party touts a country that retains the British pound, while its future European Union membership creates the benefits of ""open borders, shared rights, free trade and extensive cooperation."" Cameron has vocally opposed Scottish independence. In February, he said he was ""100% clear that I will fight with everything I have to keep our United Kingdom together,"" since an intact United Kingdom, consisting of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, ""is stronger, safer, richer and fairer."" In medieval times, Scotland fought for freedom from England, which Mel Gibson dramatically depicted in his Academy Award-winning movie ""Braveheart."" Not long after Wallace died in the early 1300s, Robert the Bruce led Scotland to independence, and it remained an autonomous nation until the Act of Union joined Scotland and England in 1707. The United Kingdom returned some autonomy to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and gave them the right to form their own parliaments, in the late 1990s. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne, Matthew Chance and Dave Gilbert contributed to this report.","Brits, Scots agree to hold referendum on Scottish independence .

"San Diego (CNN) -- The Christmas Eve double killing tantalized Southern California: a 22-year-old woman and her fiance's brother were found shot, both in the head, in a car in a San Diego mall parking lot. Then Ilona Flint's fiance went missing, prompting a monthlong search that officially ended Thursday when authorities identified a body found in a car 100 miles away in Riverside as that of Gianni Belvedere, 24. What some first speculated as a love triangle gone wrong with two brothers has now become something more complicated -- a triple murder case in which authorities are still seeking suspects and explanations. Belvedere's body, decomposed in his own car trunk, was identified by fingerprint, and his death was ruled a homicide, Riverside police said Thursday. San Diego police have scheduled a press conference on the case Friday. It all began after Flint finished work at a Macy's that was open late for Christmas shoppers in Mission Valley Center Mall. Salvatore Belvedere apparently went to pick up his future sister-in-law in the post-midnight darkness -- a gesture close friends described as a family courtesy, dismissing media speculation about a love triangle. At 1:15 a.m. on December 24, Flint called 911 from a car reporting she had been shot, but she didn't know the vehicle's exact location, other than being near the mall. Police found Flint dead in the car and 22-year-old Salvatore Belvedere, in the driver's seat, fighting for his life with gunshot wounds to his head and torso. He died three days later. Gianni Belvedere was last seen at his residence at about 10 p.m. on December 23. After the double shooting, a police bulletin listed him as a missing person. Police and the coroner in Riverside on Thursday declined to comment about their investigation into Gianni Belvedere's homicide. ""There was a lot of idiotic speculation that Gianni had something to do with the shooting or that he had possibly harmed himself, that he might have fled, that he was in a jealous rage and did this,"" said Andre Briones, who was such close friends with Flint that he has a tattoo of her likeness on the inside of his left forearm. ""Anyone who knows the family, anyone who knows Gianni and Ilona's relationship completely understands that there is no possible way that could have ever happened,"" Briones told CNN on Wednesday. Flint had worked for a year at a vintage clothing store that Briones owned, he said. Investigators haven't disclosed a motive in the double murders at the mall, other than they have ruled out robbery. ""In looking through the evidence at the scene, it does not appear that any sort of robbery took place during this incident,"" San Diego Lt. Michael Hastings said. In the days after the shooting, Belvedere family members joined candlelight vigils and made urgent public appeals to find Gianni Belvedere. The family also appealed to their missing son and brother. ""If you hear me, please call me, call your family, we do need you right now,"" Antoinette Belvedere, a sister, told reporters two days after the mall shooting. The two brothers worked at a family Italian restaurant in Lakeside, outside of San Diego, Briones said. Flint and the two brothers lived in the Belvedere family home in San Diego, Briones added. ""She was with Gianni for a very long time. They loved each other deeply. And she really cared about Sal,"" Briones said. ""Even though she was shot ... she was still able to call 911 for herself and Sal."" Gianni Belvedere's car was discovered Friday in a fast-food parking lot in Riverside. Neighbor Karen Regalado said she noticed the car was parked in the lot for about a week and a half, but ""I never smelled an odor coming from it."" But one passer-by did notice something suspicious and called police, who found a decomposed body of a young man in the trunk. The engaged couple were together for about seven years and met in Provo, Utah, where Flint's family lives. Flint then moved to San Diego at her fiance's invitation, Briones said. ""They were a great family,"" Briones said of the couple and the brother. CNN's Casey Wian and Chuck Johnston reported from San Diego, and Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Authorities identify decomposed body as a missing San Diego .

"(CNN) -- Virginia's proclamation of Confederate History Month without any reference to slavery was unacceptable, President Obama said in an interview broadcast Friday. ""Well, you know, I'm a big history buff. And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be a part of,"" he told ABC in an interview taped Thursday. ""Now, I don't think you can understand the Confederacy and the Civil War unless you understand slavery. And so, I think that was a -- an unacceptable omission. I think the governor's now acknowledged that."" Obama was referring to Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who apologized Wednesday for leaving out any reference to slavery in his recent proclamation designating April as Confederate History Month, calling it a ""major omission."" McDonnell, a Republican, also said he would amend the proclamation. ABC asked the nation's first African-American president to weigh in on the controversy. ""I think it's just a reminder that when we talk about issues like slavery that are so fraught with pain and emotion, that we'd better do so thinking through how this is going to affect a lot of people, and their sense of whether they're part of a commonwealth or part of our broader society."" McDonnell's written apology said, ""The failure to include any reference to slavery was a mistake, and for that I apologize to any fellow Virginian who has been offended or disappointed."" ""The abomination of slavery divided our nation, deprived people of their God-given inalienable rights, and led to the Civil War,"" the statement said. ""Slavery was an evil, vicious and inhumane practice which degraded human beings to property, and it has left a stain on the soul of this state and nation."" The new language added to the proclamation says that ""it is important for all Virginians to understand that the institution of slavery led to this war and was an evil and inhumane practice that deprived people of their God-given inalienable rights."" It adds that ""all Virginians are thankful for its permanent eradication from our orders."" McDonnell's statement noted that while Virginia was home to the capital of the Confederacy, it was also the first state in the nation to elect an African-American governor, L. Douglas Wilder, whom McDonnell called ""my friend."" In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Wilder said McDonnell's apology and his introduction of additional proclamation language was ""the right thing for him to have done."" ""Most people recognize that slavery was the cause of the [Civil] war,"" Wilder said, noting that McDonnell had called him Wednesday. ""The war was not a glorious thing in our past. It was something that we were able to withstand in terms of tearing the country apart. ... Thank God that war ended with the Confederacy losing."" Not all of Wilder's fellow Democrats were willing to forgive McDonnell so quickly Wednesday. ""He has a right to apologize,"" Virginia state Sen. Henry Marsh III, who is also African-American, told CNN on Wednesday. ""But I don't accept that as a good answer, because this is a pattern of this governor. ""He says the wrong thing, he sends a signal to his base, and then he makes an apology,"" Marsh said. ""It's a question of whether or not he's sincere or not."" McDonnell is the first Virginia governor in eight years to issue a proclamation declaring April as Confederate History Month. Two previous Democratic administrations refused to do so. ""It is important for all Virginians to reflect upon our Commonwealth's shared history, to understand the sacrifices of the Confederate leaders, soldiers and citizens during the period of the Civil War, and to recognize how our history has led to our present,"" the proclamation reads in part. Former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, now the Democratic National Committee chairman, issued a statement Wednesday blasting the exclusion of slavery from the original proclamation. ""Governor McDonnell's decision to designate April as Confederate History Month without condemning, or even acknowledging, the pernicious stain of slavery or its role in the war disregards history, is insensitive to the extraordinary efforts of Americans to eliminate slavery and bind the nation's wounds, and offends millions of Americans of all races and in all parts of our nation,"" Kaine wrote. ""A failure to acknowledge the central role of slavery in the Confederacy and deeming insignificant the reprehensible transgression of moral standards of liberty and equality that slavery represented is simply not acceptable in the America of the 21st century,"" he continued.","NEW: One former governor forgives omission, one does not .

"(CNN) -- Switzerland will not send Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski to the United States to face sentencing for child sex charges, the Ministry of Justice announced Monday. He is now free, the ministry said. Polanski pleaded guilty in Los Angeles, California, in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, but fled to Europe before he was sentenced. He was arrested in Switzerland last year and had been fighting extradition since then. Switzerland was not making a decision about the severity of the charge or whether Polanski was guilty, Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said. ""It's not about qualifying the crime. That is not our job. It's also not about deciding over guilt or innocence,"" she said. The Swiss rejected the American request because the United States did not supply all the legal records Switzerland requested, and because Polanski had a reasonable right to think he would not be arrested if he visited the country, she said. U.S. prosecutors cannot apply again to Switzerland to have Polanski extradited, she said, but could apply to other countries to detain and extradite him. ""We are deeply disappointed,"" said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice Department's criminal division. ""We thought our extradition request was supported by the facts. We're going to review our options."" Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley also expressed disappointment, saying that the United States ""believes that the rape of a 13-year-old child by an adult is a crime"" and would continue to pursue justice in the case. Asked about comments by the Swiss attorney general that suggested technical errors in the U.S. extradition request, Crowley said: ""A 13-year-girl was drugged and raped by an adult -- this is not a matter of technicality."" Polanski was 43 at the time he had unlawful sex with the girl. He is now 76. Prosecutors dropped rape and other charges in exchange for his guilty plea. But Polanski fled the country before he was sentenced after learning that the judge might not go along with the short jail term Polanski expected to get in exchange for his plea. He has been a fugitive since 1978 and lived in France before his arrest. Swiss authorities released the director from jail on $4.5 million bail in early December ""pending extradition"" to the United States. Polanski's victim came forward long ago and has made her identity public, saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Samantha Geimer, now in her 40s and a married mother of three, has called for the case to be tossed out. Her attorney, Larry Silver, reiterated her position in December , saying details of the case harm her every time the story is in the news. Defense attorneys also argued that prosecutors are ignoring the victim's wishes. Polanski's attorney, Chad Hummel, has been pushing for Polanski to be sentenced without having to return to Los Angeles. Prosecutors have vigorously opposed sentencing him in absentia. In court papers filed in January, Deputy District Attorney David Walgren stated the reasons in no uncertain terms. ""The defendant is a fugitive,"" Walgren wrote. ""A fugitive child rapist, who for 32 years has made a mockery of our criminal justice system, should not be given the power or authority to request anything of this court until he, the criminal, acknowledges this court's lawful authority by surrendering on his outstanding warrant."" Polanski won an Oscar for best director for the Holocaust drama ""The Pianist,"" and was nominated for ""Tess,"" ""Chinatown,"" and the screenplay he wrote for ""Rosemary's Baby.""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani security forces launched an operation against Taliban militants in the nation's tribal region along the border with Afghanistan on Tuesday, shutting down NATO supply routes, Pakistani military sources said. Containers bearing supplies for US-led forces and NATO in Afghanistan wait in Pakistan in November. Eight people -- two suspected Taliban militants and six civilians -- died in the operation in the Khyber Agency that involved military helicopter gunships, according to Pakistani intelligence sources. The fighting was taking place near the town of Jamrud. The Khyber Pass, a key transit link for NATO and U.S. military supplies from Pakistan to Afghanistan, has been closed as a result of the operation, said Tariq Hayat, Khyber's political agent. He did not know when it would reopen. In a released statement, United States forces in Afghanistan praised Pakistan's incursion. ""We are pleased with the operation to clear out insurgent in the areas adjacent to the pass so our supplies can go unhindered. This temporary delay will result in the long-term gains for all that use that passage route. There is no immediate impact in our ability to provide supplies to the troops."" NATO and U.S. military supplies are being re-routed, mostly air-lifted, sources tell CNN. The Kyber Pass -- an ancient, three-mile pass which links Pakistan to Afghanistan through the Hindu Kush range -- has traditionally been a vital route for supplies into Afghanistan. Recent hit-and-run attacks have compromised supply convoys, forcing coalition forces to find alternate routes. NATO countries are working on plans with countries in the north -- Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- for possible new supply routes. Earlier this month, militants fired rockets at a supply terminal in Peshawar that sits along the route. The attack left two people dead, two others wounded and 12 trucks ablaze. And last month, Pakistani officials suspended travel through the mountain pass, citing security concerns. They reversed their decision a day later.","Pakistan launches operations against Taliban militants in Afghan border region .

"(CNN) -- Troubled actress Amanda Bynes is mentally competent to stand trial, California Judge James Bianco ruled during a court hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The 27-year-old, who has been out of the spotlight since being placed under involuntary psychiatric hold four months ago, can now undergo criminal proceedings stemming from a DUI case. Bynes was initially detained for a mental health evaluation in late July after her involvement in a residential disturbance and was then held in a psychiatric facility. At the time, the ""Easy A"" star had a number of legal troubles, between the alleged DUI and three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment window in May. In September, Bynes was moved from UCLA Medical Center to a private facility for ""specialized treatment"" at the recommendation of ""the skilled health care professionals of UCLA,"" Bynes' parents said in a statement. Now that Bianco has determined Bynes to be mentally competent, a progress report has been scheduled for January 7. Bynes' parents, Rick and Lynn, have publicly stated that they have faith their daughter will ""pull through"" her current ""situation."" ""We appreciate everyone's heartfelt support, and we hope that she can get some privacy and the respect she deserves during this trying time,"" Lynn Bynes said in a statement to People magazine in October. ""Both my husband and I love Amanda very much and we know she will get through this situation.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Postal Service does not have the money to meet an obligation to a retiree health care trust fund coming due at the end of the month, but if there's a default, officials promise no interruption in the mail, the payroll, or payments to suppliers. Commenting in response to a New York Times article Monday suggesting the Postal Service may have to shut down within months, spokeswoman Yvonne Yoerger told CNN there's ""nothing actually new in the Postal Service's position."" ""We are required to make this $5.5 billion dollar payment into the future retiree health benefits fund, and probably won't be able to make it when it comes due September 30th."" The fund was mandated by a 2006 postal reform act that postal officials today believe does not match the reality of declining revenues and a smaller workforce. Tuesday, congressional lawmakers will address the matter in a hearing on postal operations. Yoerger said at that hearing, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe will insist that the fund be re-scaled from the days when there were 900,000 people on the payroll. The mandated funding level has not changed in the years since then, although the Postal Service has trimmed 250,000 jobs. She said ""the fact is, no other government agency, and few corporations in the private sector are required to fund retiree health benefits 75 years out."" The newspaper quoted U.S. Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, as saying the financial problems are so dire the Postal Service may close later this year. Yoerger agrees her agency does not have a sustainable business model, but stopped short of saying a shutdown is possible. One answer is to adjust those mandated payments. ""We want to have the pre-funding mandate eliminated, and have the money already paid into it used for those purposes"" of covering health care benefits for future retirees. She said, ""We've overpaid into our retirement funds, and we'd like some of those overpayments refunded and used for future funding."" She acknowledged the basis for the advance payments were mandated in 2006 because lawmakers wanted assurances the Postal Service could cover benefits for its future pensioners. In addition to relief from the future retiree payment mandate, Yoerger said the proposed business plan of the Postal Service would include a combination of closing post offices, expanding joint ventures with private industry, and changes in how often you get the mail. ""Right now we are required to deliver six days a week,"" she said, ""if it can go to five days a week, as proposed, we could better match the declining volume of mail.""","Postal Service may miss September 30 payment to retiree fund .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- One week ago, angry, disenfranchised and energized Egyptians emerged from Friday prayers, took to the streets and chanted, ""Freedom!"" ""We want (Mubarak) to leave,"" said one 19-year-old man hours after the intense day of protests. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is not gone, but his days are numbered. The leader agreed Tuesday to not seek re-election in September. He told ABC News Thursday he would like to step down right away, but cannot because he does not want to risk plunging his nation into chaos. In the bloody blur of days since his announcement that he would not stand for re-election, regime foes and opponents have clashed repeatedly in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the center of anti-government demonstrations. Eight people have been killed and nearly 850 injured, according to the health ministry. Although his government has made concessions, Mubarak faces another challenge Friday, which opponents have dubbed ""Day of Farewell"" and ""Day of Departure"" -- references to further large protests they hope will prompt the president to step down now. Thursday saw an escalation of attacks on journalists, many of whom asked whether the government was clearing them out of the way so as to cloak its actions. Journalists said it was too dangerous to be at Tahrir Square or to provide live camera feeds. Vice President Omar Suleiman laid some of the unrest's blame on the media. ""I actually blame certain friendly nations who have television channels, they are not friendly at all, who have intensified the youth against the nation and the state,"" Suleiman told Nile TV. ""They have filled in the minds of the youth with wrongdoings, with allegations, and this is unacceptable."" State-run Nile TV said a segment of anti-government protesters, called the 25th of January Youth, will leave the square and form a political party to compete in upcoming elections. Meanwhile, CNN's Anderson Cooper said on ""Parker Spitzer"" Thursday night that, if anything, the Mubarak foes increased the portion of Tahrir Square they occupy in the standoff. It's not clear if organizers of the protests planned after Friday prayers would be able to rally the numbers they had last week or reach the presidential palace, Cooper said. Tension was building before dawn Friday, he said. Mubarak told ABC News correspondent Christiane Amanpour that he was troubled by the bloody clashes that broke out Wednesday in Tahrir Square. As the United States and other countries condemned increasing attacks on journalists and diplomats, Mubarak rejected the notion that government instigated the violence in the country, instead blaming the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist umbrella group that is banned in Egypt. ""I don't care what people say about me,"" Mubarak told ABC. ""Right now I care about my country, I care about Egypt. ""I was very unhappy about yesterday. I do not want to see Egyptians fighting each other,"" he said in the interview, which was conducted at the heavily guarded presidential palace where the embattled leader has been staying with his family. Mubarak told ABC that U.S. President Barack Obama is a very good man but bristled at the notion of an ally's interference in internal problems. He said he told Obama: ""You don't understand the Egyptian culture and what would happen if I step down now."" Obama has said he told Mubarak a transition must take place, and it ""must be meaningful, it must be peaceful and it must begin now."" Mubarak said he never intended to seek re-election. Nor did he intend his son, Gamal, who was believed to be groomed as Mubarak's successor, to seek the post. He made the comment to Amanpour in his son's presence. The Obama administration had no comment on the interview. A White House aide told CNN the only thing that caught the administration's attention from the interview was Mubarak's comments on his son. Suleiman, tapped as Mubarak's vice president last Saturday, publicly announced Thursday that Gamal Mubarak will not stand in September elections. Hosni Mubarak, who has ruled Egypt for three decades, announced this week that he would not run for re-election. But that concession has not been enough for tens of thousands of protesters demanding immediate change. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN's John King that negotiations on new leadership and elections are crucial. ""The longer that this transition is delayed the likelihood of further escalation and violence is increased,"" he said. Although Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, was largely calm Thursday, there are concerns about possible clashes when anti-Mubarak demonstrators mark a ""Day of Farewell,"" a reference to the president, according to CNN's Nic Robertson. Mubarak's regime moved Thursday to quell the deadly revolt, telling protesters their demands had been met and cracking down on journalists and human rights activists bearing witness to the crisis. All day long, Mubarak's supporters and foes clashed to retain control of Tahrir Square, the central city plaza that has become the symbol of the 10-day Egyptian uprising. Many looked like medieval warriors, toting handcrafted shields while throwing stones and other objects. Top government leaders vowed to hold accountable perpetrators of the bloodshed and told protesters to return home. ""I want to thank the youth for all you have done,"" Suleiman said on state-run Nile TV. ""You are the lights that have ignited reform in this period. Please give the (government a) chance to play its role. All of your demands have been met."" Suleiman told ABC that Egyptian troops will not force anti-Mubarak protesters to leave Tahrir Square. Mubarak supporters, some believed to be paid government thugs, converged with anti-government crowds Wednesday in a confrontation that quickly evolved into continuing mayhem in Tahrir Square. At least eight people were killed and 836 injured, including 200 wounded within one hour Thursday morning, according to the health ministry. Journalists covering the crisis also became targets -- beaten, bloodied, harassed and detained by men, most all in some way aligned with Mubarak. Numerous news outlets -- including the BBC, ABC News, Fox News, the Washington Post and CNN -- reported members of their staffs had either been attacked or arrested. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also reported that staffers were detained. In several cases, news personnel were accused of being ""foreign spies,"" seized, whisked away, and often assaulted. Graeme Wood, a correspondent for The Atlantic, told CNN he was dragged from a car at a checkpoint Thursday and accused of spying for Iran. ""This is a dark day for Egypt and a dark day for journalism,"" said Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""The systematic and sustained attacks ... leave no doubt that a government-orchestrated effort to target the media and suppress the news is well under way."" New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof said he fears an even broader crackdown. ""Why doesn't the government want us around? What is it that it plans to do in the next few days that it really doesn't want cameras to be able to report on?"" Kristof asked on CNN's ""Situation Room."" The U.S. State Department publicly condemned the crackdown on journalists, and officials told CNN they have received reports that Egypt's Interior Ministry was involved. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called such attacks ""a violation of international norms that guarantee freedom of the press, and it is unacceptable in any circumstances."" Vice President Joe Biden told Suleiman that Egypt's government is responsible for ensuring that peaceful demonstrators aren't attacked. Increasingly concerned about the potential for further violence, Clinton called on the government, political parties and others to immediately begin talks ""on a peaceful and orderly transition."" The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain also urged a ""rapid and peaceful transition,"" and the European Union foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, called on Mubarak to act ""as quickly as possible."" Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq apologized repeatedly for the violence. He blamed infiltrators and a ""complete disappearance"" of police for the human toll in the ""catastrophe."" ""This group got in and some clashes happened,"" Shafiq said, adding that he would look into whether the violence was part of an organized attempt to disband the opposition. Shafiq said he and Suleiman were meeting with the opposition -- including protesters in Tahrir Square. He said no one would be excluded from the national dialogue, including the Muslim Brotherhood. The United States is stepping up pressure on the opposition to begin immediate negotiations with the Egyptian government, recognizing the orderly transition to democracy Obama called for could prove difficult if Mubarak stepped down immediately. ""We can't dictate what an orderly transition means, but it's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves,"" a senior State Department official told CNN. ""The government has to take some steps, but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well.""

"(CNN) -- The suspected link between Chinese drywall and toxic effects reported by thousands of U.S. homeowners was strengthened Monday by three preliminary reports issued by the federal government. The strongest link came from an analysis of air sampled inside dozens of homes containing drywall made in China. ""While the study of 51 homes detected hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde ... at concentrations below irritant levels, it is possible that the additive or synergistic effects of these and other compounds in the subject homes could cause irritant effects,"" the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in its executive summary of the study. Two other preliminary studies found copper sulfide corrosion in metal components taken from homes containing the Chinese drywall. The drywall in question was imported from 2005 through 2007, when a housing boom and two active hurricane seasons created a shortage of building materials in the southern United States. Since then, the product safety agency has received nearly 2,100 reports from 32 states -- but mostly from Florida, Louisiana and Virginia -- of homeowners complaining of a rotten-egg smell, sickness, failed appliances, and corroded wires and pipes. Many have moved out of their homes. In some cases, insurers have refused to reimburse them. The air study tested 41 houses containing Chinese drywall and compared those findings with air from inside 10 homes in the same geographical areas whose homeowners had not complained, said Jack McCarthy, president of Environmental Health & Engineering Inc., which carried out the work. The investigators also examined materials such as copper pipes and wiring for corrosion, and looked at indoor air humidity, temperature and air exchange, he said. Copper and silver strips were left in the homes for two weeks and then examined for corrosion, he said. The result: in the 41 homes containing the problem drywall, there was a ""strong association"" between the high levels of hydrogen sulfide and the corrosion of the metals, he said. ""Temperature, humidity and air-exchange rates also appear to be contributing factors,"" McCarthy told reporters on a conference call, noting that higher moisture and temperature levels and lower air-exchange rates were connected with more corrosion. Formaldehyde, also a potential source of irritation, was found in both complaint and noncomplaint homes, he said. Though McCarthy cautioned that the study was not intended to examine health effects, ""we can say that the levels of the pollutants we found, particularly the hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde, could possibly contribute to some of the health problems that have been reported to the CPSC."" McCarthy also said that not all Chinese drywall may be alike. Its risk ""depends on what it is made of, not necessarily what country it's from,"" he said. The next step is to determine how to identify homes with the corrosive materials and how to fix them, said Scott Wolfson, the product safety agency's director of information and public affairs, who noted that the investigation is the largest in the agency's history. He said none of the tainted drywall entered the United States this year. Hundreds of thousands of suspect boards have been stockpiled in warehouses; their owners have been told it will not be sold, he added. Several weeks ago, agency representatives traveled to China, where they visited mines, factories and government officials to determine the scope of the problem, which is still not clear, Wolfson said. ""The CPSC is working hard to determine how many homes in how many states are affected,"" he said, adding that the data do not support the widely reported figure of 100,000 homes. Wolfson said the Chinese helped investigate. ""They're committed to helping us with the technical side of this investigation,"" he said. Though the study raises suspicions that the drywall is responsible for the health effects reported by some families, Wolfson said a causal association has not been proved. ""The work continues,"" he said. ""The work toward an exact nexus between drywall and effects is still ongoing."" Wolfson called on the news media to help alert homeowners in affected houses to report the problem. Some may be hesitant to report because they are afraid their insurers will drop their coverage, he said, but he pointed out that the reports can be made confidentially. ""We will make sure that you are not harmed in any way by reporting to the government,"" he said. Monday's report did not surprise Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, who said the product safety commission's chairwoman, Inez Tenenbaum, told him Monday she did not know when further testing would be completed. ""I am very disappointed with the whole process, and especially that the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] can't say whether drywall is harmful to people's health,"" he told CNN. ""Common sense says otherwise, but we still lack definitive answers."" Joan Glickman, who moved out of her townhouse in Pompano Beach, Florida, after her wiring and air conditioning failed, said Monday's report told her nothing new. ""It was a huge letdown because it still didn't tell me how to fix it, who's going to fix it, how do we go about fixing it, where the money comes from,"" said Glickman, who moved in with her mother. ""This has left us in such a mess."" CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this story from Miami, Florida.","Air samples from 41 homes containing drywall made in China are analyzed .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Authorities on Friday identified a British man and a woman from New Zealand as the two foreigners killed in Libya and their bodies found on a beach west of Tripoli. Libya's foreign ministry said they were discovered shot on Thursday in Mellitah, west of the city of Sabratha, according to a statement by the official Libyan News Agency. ""The foreign ministry ... is following up with great interest on the progress of the investigation into the killings,"" the statement said. The British government confirmed one of them was a Briton, and New Zealand's foreign ministry said the other was one of its citizens. Neither were identified and there was no further information about how or when they died. ""The exact circumstance of their deaths is not yet clear and will be subject to an investigation by the Libyan authorities,"" said the New Zealand ministry in a statement, adding that its slain national was visiting Libya. The Sabratha Local Council -- the area's governing body -- also acknowledged the killings in a statement. ""The Sabratha Local Council and the residents of the area offer their deepest condolences to the families of the deceased and to the states of Britain and New Zealand, as this act is contrary to our morals and values of our religion,"" the council said. The two foreigners had been reported missing and police were searching for them when their bodies were discovered, the Sabratha Media Center, a local activist news group, said. It was not immediately clear from the media center how long they had been missing or when exactly they died. Their bodies were found on Tallil Seyahi Beach about 50 miles (85 kilometers) west of Tripoli, added the group, which noted they had been killed. An initial police investigation showed the two had been on a picnic in a somewhat remote area near a partially built resort. A photo posted on the Sabratha Media Center Facebook page purports to show the man and woman, who are lying facedown in the sand. Near the bodies is a blanket that is spread out, with food and drinks strewn about. A backpack is nearby. CNN could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the photo, which the Sabratha Media Center said it obtained and posted on Facebook. The police investigation indicated tire marks in the area. Investigators are looking for possible motives, officials said. There has been a rise in crime in the area in recent weeks, including a Libyan man who was killed in a reported carjacking, according to the media center. The beaches in and around Sabratha are among some of the most developed on Libya's western coastline. They were a popular destination for picnics and swimming among foreigners before the 2011 uprising that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi. CNN's Sara Mazloumsaki, Greg Botelho and Chelsea J.

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Israeli navy took control of a boat that violated an Israeli blockade and crossed into Gazan waters Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said, while a Gaza group said the ship was carrying humanitarian aid, a former U.S. congresswoman and a Nobel laureate. Cynthia McKinney reportedly is asking the international community to demand the crew's release. The boat's crew included former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney, according to the Free Gaza Movement, a human rights group that sent the boat it calls ""Spirit of Humanity"" from Cyprus. Along with McKinney, who served six terms in the House of Representatives from Georgia and was the Green Party's presidential nominee in 2008, Israeli authorities took 20 people into custody, the group said. Also aboard, the group said, was Mairead Maguire, who co-founded a group that worked for peace in Northern Ireland. Maguire and co-founder Betty Williams received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for their work. IDF said the Israeli navy contacted the boat, which it called the Arion, while it was still at sea and warned the crew they would not be allowed to enter Gazan waters ""because of security risks in the area and the existing naval blockade."" Disregarding all warnings, the boat entered Gazan coastal waters, IDF said. An Israeli navy force intercepted, boarded and took control of the boat, directing it toward Ashdod, Israel, IDF said. The boat's crew, the military said, would ""be handed over to the proper authorities."" Without naming individuals on the boat, IDF confirmed the incident it described was the same one detailed by the Free Gaza Movement. According to the Free Gaza group, McKinney said, ""This is an outrageous violation of international law against us. Our boat was not in Israeli waters, and we were on a human rights mission to the Gaza Strip,"" before authorities confiscated cell phones. ""President Obama just told Israel to let in humanitarian and reconstruction supplies, and that's exactly what we tried to do. We're asking the international community to demand our release so we can resume our journey,"" McKinney said, according to the group. McKinney's father, former Georgia state legislator Billy McKinney of Atlanta, said he received a call from his daughter about 3 a.m. Tuesday. She told him ""I'm OK. I'm OK,"" then hung up as Israeli military began to board the ship, Billy McKinney said. He added that the U.S. State Department gave his family a contact with the U.S. Embassy in Israel but by Tuesday night the family had not heard anything back from the embassy. IDF said the aid aboard the boat would be delivered to Gaza ""subject to authorization."" ""Any organization or country that wishes to transfer humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip can legally do so via the established crossings between Israel and the Gaza Strip with prior coordination,"" IDF said. Free Gaza said the Spirit of Humanity voyage is the eighth such trip the group has launched. Five succeeded, the group said, but the Israeli military stopped attempts in January and December 2008.","Free Gaza Movement says its boat was taking aid to Gaza .

"Rawalpindi, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide bomber killed at least 35 people Monday by detonating explosives outside a bank where people had lined up to pick up their monthly checks, police said. The blast, in the Cannt area of the city, also wounded more than 65 others, said Imdad Ullah Bosal, a district coordination officer. Two women were among the dead, he said. Meanwhile, another suicide bomber detonated his explosives at a police checkpoint in Lahore hours after the Rawalpindi attack, a police official told CNN. The bombers, believed to be wearing suicide vests, blew themselves up as police inspected their vehicle at the Babu Sabu checkpoint, according to Lahore police chief Pervez Rethore. The blast injured at least 17 police and civilians, a local rescue services spokesman said. At least three people sustained serious injuries, Rethore said. In recent weeks, Pakistan has been rocked relentlessly by a wave of attacks as Islamic militants retaliate against a military offensive to rout insurgents operating along its border with Afghanistan. The worsening situation prompted the United Nations to announce Monday that it was pulling all non-emergency foreign staffers from the country's northwest. The scene of Monday's deadly explosion in Rawalpindi is about 18 miles (30 kilometers) from the capital city of Islamabad. It is a closely guarded city that is home to the country's military headquarters. The Cannt area is short for cantonment, so called because of its proximity to the military offices. It is home to several travel agencies and mid-range hotels. The bomber rode up to the front of the National Bank in a motorcycle or a bicycle, said Rawalpindi Police Chief Rao Muhammad Iqbal. The impact of the bomb was so intense that residents a block away said they thought the blast took place where they were. The explosion blew out windows in the three-story building and blackened its walls. Rescue workers in surgical masks picked through the rubble looking for survivors. Iqbal Nisouwana, a driver, who rushed to the scene to help tend to the wounded said he saw five men in uniform among the wounded. ""Two soldiers were injured. I helped put them in the ambulance,"" Nisouwana said. ""And I saw three more wounded."" ""One old man called to me for help,"" he added. ""I tried to pick him up but he was too heavy."" On October 10, militants held dozens of hostages for some 22 hours inside the army headquarters in Rawalpindi. Eleven military personnel, three civilians, and nine militants were killed in the siege. On October 20, back-to-back explosions took place at Islamabad's International Islamic University. At least six people died in the attack. Twenty-nine others were wounded. And on October 28, a massive car bomb tore through the heart of a bustling marketplace in Peshawar, killing at least 100 people and injuring at least 200 others. The attack on the capital of the North West Frontier Province was the deadliest terrorist attack on Pakistan since the October 2007 attack on a homecoming rally for former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. More than 135 people were killed in the suicide bombing in Karachi. Bhutto escaped harm, but she was assassinated two months later. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is now the president of the country. The U.N. decision to withdraw staffers applies to all except those needed for emergency, humanitarian and security operations in the North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), said spokeswoman Ishrat Rizvi. The agency has been providing aid to the 2 million Pakistanis who have been displaced in the fighting between government forces and Islamic militants. This year, the United Nations has lost several staffers to terror attacks, including five who were killed in a suicide bombing at the World Food Programme offices in Islamabad last month. Two more U.N. workers died when attackers shot their way onto the grounds of the Pearl-Continental Hotel in Peshawar in June and set off a car bomb. And gunmen killed a U.N. worker during a kidnapping attempt in Peshawar in July.

"(CNN) -- Our democracies are facing a moment of truth. From the rise of extremism in the European Union to the political gridlock in the United States, leaders are struggling to respond effectively to new and complex global challenges. Citizens feel alienated with conventional politics and frustrated by the absence of effective policies that serve societies' needs. That's why I am convinced that the real issue we face is not simply defining economic solutions, but rethinking our democratic institutions. In any healthy democracy, there must be a balance between strong government and an empowered electorate that holds that government to account. But our democratic institutions have been captured by special interests. Policy is driven by powerful lobbies. Despite the rise of social media, media itself is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few. Watch George Papandreou's TED Talk . The speed and power of financial markets make democratic deliberation near impossible -- and government appears slow and weak in comparison. Banks have become too big to fail, which actually means too big to be accountable to the public good. We've seen this before. As Franklin D. Roosevelt once said: ""We know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob."" The absence of a global governance system allows such interests to consolidate even more power, further constraining our capacity for democratic oversight. It's not only the Occupy movement -- the 99 percenters -- who are taking a stand against this growing concentration of global wealth and power. Last year, inequality was cited as the No. 1 challenge by the World Economic Forum. Not exactly a radical leftist group. TED.com: Larry Lessig on rebuilding the republic . As we seek to rebuild our fragile economies after the financial crisis, economic measures must therefore be matched with democratic measures that rebalance this inequality and redistribute power to our citizens. A case in point is Greece, where a drastic austerity program was prescribed in exchange for emergency loans to avoid bankruptcy. Those who have paid the highest price -- low- and middle-income taxpayers, and young Greeks who now face almost 60% unemployment -- are not to blame for the crisis. Austerity has created a sense of injustice and a lack of opportunity that has fed political extremism in Greece. Opposition parties chose to enflame popular opinion rather than work together toward a common reform agenda. Such political opportunism is toxic. In Greece, it prolonged the crisis, delayed reforms and cost our country dearly. That's why I called for a referendum on the terms of Greece's bailout loans: to give ownership of the process back to the Greek people. Although that referendum didn't happen, pushing the proposal did force wider political consensus in Greece. It led to a coalition government and has given the broader public a stake in their country's future. TED.com: Rory Stewart on why democracy matters . My personal experience has taught me that hyper-partisan politics cannot lead us out of financial woes. No single party can push through the deep structural reforms that will make our economies sustainable. Such efforts require consensus, compromise and a sense of responsibility to future generations. While polarization is a deeply problematic fact of democracy, it is also true that democracies have the capacity to guard themselves against the empowerment of extremist minorities. Indeed, what seem to be the dangers and weaknesses of our democracies can be dealt with only by more democracy: ensuring a public space for participation and informed deliberation. That's why I have faith that democracies can find a way to reconcile differences and pull competing parties together for the public good. But first, we must ensure that our democracies are regenerated -- by fighting for institutions that are accountable, transparent and genuinely representative of all our citizens. TED.com: Dave Meslin on the antidote to apathy . The recent crisis gives reason to revisit the origins of democracy. In ancient Athens, democracy was an innovation to disrupt the concentration of power and maintain equality amongst citizens. We, too, need to use innovation to reclaim these principles of democracy. Online deliberation, citizen juries, crowd-sourcing for political solutions, and referenda are all useful tools inspired by the ancient Greek version of direct democracy. Politics must again become the art of imagining a better world -- and collectively finding the power to do so.

"(CNN) -- Israel's President Shimon Peres has pointed a finger at Iran over the carnage in Syria, labeling the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group Hezbollah as ""the main killer"" in the war-ravaged country. Speaking to CNN's Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Peres questioned the authenticity of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's stated desire for peace in Syria, given its support for the militia. ""The President (Rouhani) spoke really movingly about Syria, about the killing of the dead,"" he said. ""But who's killing? The main killer today in Syria is Hezbollah -- who is supporting Hezbollah, who is financing Hezbollah, who is sending them out?"" Earlier at Davos, Rouhani had urged an end to the Syrian conflict, arguing that elections were the key to resolving the issue. READ MORE: Rouhani: 'Sanctions against Iran are illegal' Peres was also asked whether the United States and other powers were being ""pulled along in a game"" in relation to a landmark deal intended to curb Iran's nuclear program, following the Iranian Foreign Minister's recent comments that the Obama administration had mischaracterized the Islamic republic's concessions. ""No,"" replied Peres. ""I say they have difficulties too, but I think President Obama is serious about (the deal), because he knows the outcome if they were to stop it at the moment. It may turn the Middle East into a nuclear region. It's (already) complicated (enough)."" Despite the tensions between Israel and Iran, Peres said he was still open to meeting with Rouhani should the opportunity arise. ""The Iranians are not our enemies historically. We don't have a joint border -- I don't see any reason why we should have a conflict,"" he said. ""The problem with Rouhani is his positions...

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain said Sunday he would not necessarily support his former running mate if she chose to run for president. Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin embrace after election results were in November 4. Speaking to ABC's ""This Week,"" McCain was asked whether Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin could count on his support. ""I can't say something like that. We've got some great other young governors. I think you're going to see the governors assume a greater leadership role in our Republican Party,"" he said. He then mentioned governors Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Jon Huntsman of Utah. McCain said he has ""the greatest appreciation for Gov. Palin and her family, and it was a great joy to know them."" ""She invigorated our campaign"" against Barack Obama for the presidency, he said. McCain was pressed on why he can't promise support for the woman who, just months ago, he named as the second best person to lead the nation. ""Have no doubt of my admiration and respect for her and my view of her viability, but at this stage, again ... my corpse is still warm, you know?"" he replied. In his first Sunday political TV appearance since November 4, McCain also promised to work to build consensus in tackling America's challenges, and criticized his own party for its latest attack on Obama. McCain rejected complaints from the Republican National Committee that Obama has not been transparent about his contacts with Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. ""I think that the Obama campaign should and will give all information necessary,"" McCain told ABC's ""This Week."" ""You know, in all due respect to the Republican National Committee and anybody -- right now, I think we should try to be working constructively together, not only on an issue such as this, but on the economy, stimulus package, reforms that are necessary."" McCain's answer came in response to a question about comments from RNC Chairman Mike Duncan. The RNC also released an Internet ad last week, titled ""Questions Remain,"" suggesting Obama is failing to provide important information about potential links between his associates and Blagojevich. Blagojevich was arrested Tuesday and charged with trying to trade Obama's Senate seat for campaign contributions and other favors. ""I don't know all the details of the relationship between President-elect Obama's campaign or his people and the governor of Illinois,"" McCain told ABC. ""But I have some confidence that all the information will come out. It always does, it seems to me."" McCain said he, like Obama and many other lawmakers, believes Blagojevich should resign. Despite the heated nature of the race and attacks both former candidates lobbed at each other, McCain emphasized that he plans to focus on pushing lawmakers past partisan politics. ""I think my job is, of course, to be a part of, and hopefully exert some leadership, in the loyal opposition. But I emphasize the word loyal,"" McCain said. ""We haven't seen economic times like this in my lifetime. We haven't seen challenges abroad at the level that we are experiencing, certainly since the end of the Cold War, and you could argue in some respects that they're certainly more complex, many of these challenges. So let's have our first priority where we can work together... ""Will there be areas of disagreement? Of course. We are different parties and different philosophy. But the nation wants us to unite and work together."" McCain said he wouldn't comment on whether he thought he had a good chance of winning the presidency, given the Bush administration and the GOP were perceived to be responsible for the economy's problems. McCain said he would ""leave that question"" for others ""to make that kind of judgment."" He pointed out that his poll numbers dropped along with the Dow. ""That would sound like I am detracting from President-elect Obama's campaign. I don't want to do that... Nobody likes a sore loser."" The key to moving past the stinging defeat, he said, is to, ""Get busy and move on. That's the best cure for it. I spent a period of time feeling sorry for myself. It's wonderful. It's one of the most enjoyable experiences that you can have. ""But the point is: You've got to move on... I'm still a senator from the state of Arizona. I still have the privilege and honor of serving this country, which I've done all my life, and it's a great honor to do so.""","McCain made his first TV appearance Sunday since losing the 2008 election .

The World Cup, which goes to South Africa for the first time next year, is the beautiful game's showpiece event and is expected to attract global interest in the African nation. FIFA's survey showed 53 percent of people were worried that the nation's crime rate -- which is one of the highest in the world -- could affect the event, which is now less than 500 days away. Are you worried crime may affect the 2010 World Cup? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. Official statistics from the country show violent crime is a major issue, with more than 17,000 murders and almost 137,000 serious and violent assaults recorded in 2007.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Eleven rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza on Thursday, a day after a fatal terrorist bombing in Jerusalem killed a woman and wounded more than 50 other people, the Israel Defense Forces said. ""The question is why,"" Brig. Gen. Yossi Kuperwasser said in a phone call Thursday, speaking about the increase in attacks, which the IDF said caused no injuries. Israel's ambassador to the United States said Thursday the rocket attacks appear ""unrelated"" to Wednesday's bombing in Jerusalem. Michael Oren said the rocket attacks probably have to do with infighting in the Hamas-controlled territory of Gaza. However, he said, there has also been an escalation in violence against his country. ""Israel has been under attack on several fronts,"" Oren said, also citing the recent murder of an Israeli family in the West Bank. One of the rockets fired Thursday hit near the southern Israeli town of Ashdod, and another landed in the southern town of Sderot, causing damage to an industrial area of the town, according to Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. In response to the rocket attacks, the Israeli military launched airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday night. Two were in the Beit Hanoun area of northern Gaza and two were in Gaza City, according to journalist Ibrahim Dahman. A Hamas building and a Hamas training camp were hit, he reported. Kuperwasser said Thursday night's strikes were aimed at trying to prevent more attacks on Israel. ""Right now there is no one in Gaza to stop this, so it's up to us to try to stop it,"" he said. ""It seems no one speaks for the Palestinians,"" he added. ""Hamas is not in charge."" There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Jerusalem attack, which was caused by a medium-sized device in a bag that had been left near Jerusalem's central bus station as the evening rush hour began. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs named the woman who died as Mary Jane Gardner, a 59-year-old British national who was studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israeli officials were continuing their investigation into Wednesday's attack, Kuperwasser said, without giving details. U.S. President Barack Obama called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to express his condolences over the Jerusalem bombing and his concern about the attacks against Israel from Gaza, the White House said in a statement. Obama ""reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to Israel's security,"" it said. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also paid a visit to Israel on Thursday. He met with his Israeli counterpart, Ehud Barak, who said Israel will not ""tolerate"" terrorist attacks. British Foreign Secretary William Hague also spoke out against the attack, calling it ""a callous and disgusting act of terrorism directed against innocent civilians which I condemn unreservedly."" The Palestinian Authority also condemned the attack, but Oren, the Israeli ambassador, criticized their comments. They ""say one thing"" and ""do another thing,"" he said. He said prominent members of the Palestinian government recently attended a ceremony at a central square near Ramallah that was named after a ""Palestinian terrorist who killed dozens of Israelis, including about 13 children."" ""The message gets out that killing Israelis is a good thing,"" Oren said. ""We need to see not just words, but deeds.""

"(CNN) -- The journey to interview Internet security guru John McAfee began with a secret phrase, a mysterious driver and a circuitous route full of left turns, right turns and U-turns. It concluded at a safe house on a tropical island paradise, where the 67-year-old was waiting in disguise --as an old man with salt and pepper hair -- to tell his bizarre tale. ""It hasn't been a lot of fun. I miss my prior life. Much of it has been deprivation. No baths, poor food,"" McAfee told CNN Friday in his first on-camera interview since going on the run from Belize authorities who want to question him in the killing of his neighbor. Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads. Three detained in killing of Internet pioneer's neighbor . Belize authorities say they only want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting death of American businessman Gregory Faull, who was found dead in his home near San Pedro, on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye. The case began to unfold on November 9, when McAfee told police someone poisoned four of his dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said. Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a 52-year-old contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door. Two days later someone shot Faull in the head in his own living room. A 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor, and Faull was found dead on the second floor. Former girlfriend says McAfee 'frightened for his life' During the interview, McAfee said he did not kill Faull and did not pay anybody to kill the man. So why not surrender to police for questioning? ""I will not,"" McAfee said, adding his priority is to clear his name. To hear McAfee, who is not a suspect, tell it: He's a man on the run, afraid for his life, from authorities who he has been at odds with since refusing to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier. McAfee is so fearful, he says, that he carries up to a dozen disposable cell phones at one time. He estimates he has gone through 200 since he fled more than three weeks ago. In fact, he only agreed to an interview with CNN after a number of conversations that involved middle men, telephone calls with ever changing numbers and, finally, a cloak and dagger meeting complete with a secret phrase and response. The phrase: ""Sorry I'm late."" The response: ""That's OK, we are waiting for our co-worker."" McAfee's near daily ""catch me if you can"" game is wearing thin with investigators, who are baffled and angered by the allegations. Recently, he began a blog -- www.whoismcafee.com -- to chronicle his time on the run, the media's portrayal of him and what he describes as harassment by the Belize government. The longer it all goes on, the more suspicious police become. McAfee doesn't know how the story will play out. ""I don't have a crystal ball. I'm going to fight until something changes,"" he said. ""I will certainly not turn myself in, and I will certainly not quit fighting. I will not stop my blog."" For the software security pioneer, the end will come only if he's arrested or he gets away from corrupt officials. ""Get away doesn't mean leave the country. It means they will, No. 1, find the murderer of Mr. Faull and, No. 2, the people of this country -- who are by and large terrified to speak out -- start speaking out,"" he said. McAfee founded his namesake computer security software in 1987, running it initially out of his home in California. He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994. A 2009 story in the New York Times indicated his fortune had plunged to $4 million from its $100 million peak, due largely to the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments. McAfee moved to Belize in 2008. And in February 2010, he started QuorumEx, which claims on its website to be trying to ""re-invent the way modern medicine combats and disarms pathogenic bacteria."" CNN's Martin Savidge reported from Belize. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter wrote the story from Atlanta.","John McAfee tells CNN he did not kill his neighbor, nor did he hire somebody to do it .

"Washington (CNN) -- Missouri's tight restrictions on protests and picketing outside military funerals were tossed out by a federal judge Monday, over free speech concerns. A small Kansas church had brought suit over its claimed right to loudly march outside the burials and memorial services of those killed in overseas conflicts. The state legislature had passed a law to keep members of the Topeka-based Westboro Baptist Church from demonstrating within 300 feet of such private services. Church members, led by pastor Fred Phelps, believe God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country, shouting at grieving family members at funerals and displaying such signs as ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers,"" ""God Blew Up the Troops"" and ""AIDS Cures Fags."" The Supreme Court last year had granted a temporary injunction blocking enforcement of the law until it could be challenged. The justices will hear a similar challenge this fall involving the same church. Judge Fernando Gaitan in a 19-page order, dismissed the state legislation. The laws, said the Kansas City-based judge, ""could have the effect of criminalizing speech the mourners want to hear, including speech from counter-protesters to plaintiffs' [the Westboro Church's] message. As the law burdens substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's interest, [the law] violates the free speech clause of the First Amendment."" Phelps, his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, and other church members had protested near the August 2005 funeral of Army Spc. Edward Lee Myers in St. Joseph, Missouri. The married Army Airborne Ranger died while on patrol in Samarra, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his Humvee military vehicle. He was 21, and in addition to his wife, he left behind a daughter. He was later buried at Leavenworth National Cemetery in Kansas. In response to that protest, Missouri lawmakers passed the ""Spc. Edward Lee Myers Law,"" criminalizing picketing ""in front or about"" a funeral location or procession. Phelps-Roper then went to federal court to ask for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the statute until its constitutionality could be reviewed. A federal appeals court eventually agreed. That court did not address the broader First Amendment claims, but noted the law was overly intrusive, since it ""restricts expressive activity not just within or on the premises of a cemetery of a church, but also on traditional public fora such as the adjacent public streets and sidewalks."" The Supreme Court has never addressed the specific issues of laws designed to protect the ""sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services,"" as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased. But the justices in October will hear an appeal from the father of a U.S. solider killed in Iraq, after members of the Westboro Church conducted an angry demonstration at his son's burial service in Maryland. The family of the Marine had won a $5 million judgment from the protesters, which was overturned by lower federal courts. At issue is a balancing test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free-speech rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. Several other states besides Missouri have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest. The justices are being asked to address how far states can go to justify picket-free zones and the use of ""floating buffers"" to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting. Various jurisdictions across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the church protesters. According to a legal brief it filed with the Supreme Court, church members believe it is their duty to protest and picket at certain events, including funerals, to promote their religious message: ""That God's promise of love and heaven for those who obey him in this life is counterbalanced by God's wrath and hell for those who do not obey him."" The congregation is made up mostly of Phelps and his family. The pastor has 13 children, and at least 54 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He described himself as an ""old-time"" gospel preacher in a CNN interview in 2006, saying, ""You can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God."" The church has also protested at least since 1993 at funerals of gay persons, those who died from AIDS, and others whose lifestyles are deemed sinful but were touted as heroic upon their death. Missouri officials said the appeals court improperly balanced the free speech rights of both sides in favor of the church. ""Mourners cannot avoid a message that targets funerals without forgoing their right to partake in funeral or burial services, so are appropriately viewed as a captive audience"" that is simply unable to shut out the offensive message, said state attorneys. The case is Phelps-Roper v. Koster (06-4156-cv).","Federal judge tosses out Missouri ban on protests and picketing at military funerals .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Civic unrest over a spike in gas prices roiled Sudan for a fourth straight day Wednesday, with gunshots ringing out around the capital of Kharthoum and elsewhere as government forces tried to clamp down. High school- and college-age youths played a big part the first demonstration Sunday -- a day before the price hikes went into effect -- in Wad Madani, a city about 190 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Khartoum. One student died of gunshots during that protest. Police said that it was not known where the fatal shot came from, though activists on social media blamed police. Hundreds joined in similar demonstrations that broke out around the country in the subsequent days. Witnesses said some of these outbursts of public sentiment were accompanied by violence and destruction, including attacks on gas stations, damaging of buses and looting of stores. The ruling party's offices in different parts of Khartoum also came under attack. Police responded with tear gas, according to witnesses. There was no indication the tension was abating by Wednesday night, when the Internet appeared out and gunfire could be heard around the capital -- though it could not immediately be discerned where police or armed activists were responsible. The origin of the unrest is a government policy, which has been debated for more than a month, to get its economic house in order. As part of that plan, the Sudanese government lifted its subsidy on gas -- leading to prices nearly doubling overnight when the policy took effect early this week. That's had a trickle down effect on other expenses as well, such as bus fares, and it's expected to lead to a major uptick in food prices over the coming weeks.

"(CNN)  -- Beverly Hills, California, police want Lindsay Lohan to turn herself in on an arrest warrant issued Friday. Lindsay Lohan was placed on three years' probation after being convicted of drunken driving in 2007. A police official told CNN on Saturday that officers will be on the lookout for the actress-singer until she does so. It wasn't clear why Lohan was being sought, but the warrant, issued by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in Beverly Hills, apparently stems from her 2007 convictions for drunken driving, Beverly Hills police Sgt. Mike Foxen said. She is serving three years' probation for those convictions. ""We're hoping that she will turn herself in,"" Foxen said. Calls to Lohan's publicist and manager have not been returned. Once arrested, Lohan, 22, could go free after posting a $50,000 bond, Foxen said. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on driving under the influence charges, with a cocaine possession charge in the second incident. The first arrest in May came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a Beverly Hills curb. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehab facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police saying Lohan was trying to run her down in a car. A judge sentenced Lohan to three years' probation after she entered guilty and no-contest pleas to the charges. She served less than two hours in jail. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later when she played identical twins in Disney's ""The Parent Trap."" Since then, she has starred in at least a dozen movies, including ""Mean Girls"" and ""Georgia Rule"" with Jane Fonda in 2007. Her pop music recording career, boosted by her movie roles, has floundered. She last released an album in 2005.

"(CNN) -- Truly platonic opposite-sex friendships are the chupacabra of the pop culture narrative. From ""When Harry Met Sally"" to Ross and Rachel, first comes friendship, then comes relationship. Longtime friends Timothy Goodman, 32, and Jessica Walsh, 26, have taken to exploring the leitmotif once more -- and in a 21st century twist, decided to share it with the world via their blog, 40 Days of Dating. The two friends met more than four years ago through New York City's graphic design community. When they both found themselves single at the same time, they decided to embark on the social-turned-design experiment. Opinion: Why traditional dating is dead . ""Tim is afraid of commitment, often dating many girls at once, and he's losing sight of what a healthy relationship means,"" the couple explains on the blog. ""Jessica is a hopeless romantic, jumping into relationships too quickly, always looking to find 'the one.' "" First, they set the ground rules for the experiment, which started in mid-March: . 1. They would see each other every day for 40 days. 2. They would go on at least three dates a week. 3. They would see a couples therapist once a week. 4. They would go on one weekend trip together. 5. They would fill out a daily questionnaire and document everything. 6. They would not see, date, hook up or have sex with anyone else. They began adding new posts about the relationship only after the 40 days were up. They've been posting entries Monday through Friday since July 10, and they'll continue until August 22, when readers will learn how their experiment ended. ""We didn't want to do this live because if we read each other's questions, we'd be influenced by each other and by the public's perception of it,"" Goodman said. Their readership has grown so much that both Walsh and Goodman have had to retroactively monitor their social media accounts to prevent spoilers. The couple wouldn't offer any hints about the outcome -- they suggest people stay up-to-date with their romantic escapades via the website. Goodman and Walsh spoke to CNN separately about the online dating project and the age-old question, can men and women really just be friends? The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: Why'd you choose to do the project with each other? Goodman: We always were kind of dumbfounded with each other's relationship issues and would make fun of each other's relationship issues all the time. Walsh: I had basically, since the time I was 16, jumped from relationship to relationship up until a year and half ago when I ended a relationship with a guy I had lived with. Since then, I had been looking -- and New York City is such a tough place to find a guy. It was just a terrible year of dating. It was just the right time when we started talking about it. CNN: You've been friends for more than four years. Was there always an attraction? Goodman: It's always been platonic, but we wouldn't have been able to do this project if there hadn't been some curiosity. I've always been attracted to Jessie; I know she's beautiful. We're very different though; I'm more outgoing, she's more reserved. Walsh: He's not my usual type, I always thought he was a very attractive guy. I have a lot of respect for the work that he does -- I can't deny that there. CNN: Were you ever worried that the experiment would ruin the friendship? Walsh: I was pretty excited about it at first, then after we told our friends, I did start to get scared that this could totally destroy a great friendship. We didn't want to compromise, so it was a few months after we had the initial idea before we actually started because we kept going back and forth. CNN: You're obviously both creative people, and the site itself is very artistically driven. How did you separate the creative showmanship with the relationship? Goodman: What's important is that it's an experiment. For it to be a success, it doesn't mean that Jessie and I worked out together. We used it as a catalyst to work on our issues together; a safe space to work on our issues and also to help each other. Sure, there were other things going on and there had always been a curiosity about it. This isn't just about dating, that's not the point -- it's taking two mice with two different problems and seeing what happens. Walsh: We tried to keep them very different. We did the experiment first because we did want the experiment to be as true as possible, and not have the creative side get in the way of it. This is the best way we knew how. Each time we read each other's, we're reliving the day in a way. In some of the more emotional days, it brings back everything. It hasn't been easy. CNN: The rules are quite fastidious for something so unpredictable as a relationship. Goodman: We knew that if we didn't have rules in place, it would be very easy for us to skip by. The rules held us accountable. Walsh: It's kind of a theme in the work that I do, I always set constraints. The best outcomes come from restraints. Forty days is also the amount of time in several religions that it takes to break a bad habit. The couples therapy was one stipulation that I really wanted. It was amazing week to week to have that hour to sit down and really be able to reflect and have a third party to help you organize and sort through what happened and give you that objective advice. I honestly don't think we would've made it through the 40 days without it. CNN: In the early days of the blog, your friends criticized you both for not being physical. You left those constraints pretty ambiguous. On day 25, readers learned, that changed. Goodman: We had left that open. It was bit of an issue right in the beginning because her friend was giving her (a hard time) about it. She got weird about it. We can't just click our fingers and be in a relationship. There was a lot of push and pull because of it. I didn't know what my intentions were. Walsh: I had wanted it for a while. I was just like, ""Let's try this."" We both admitted on day two of the therapy that there was attraction, there was some interest. Tim was the one that was super scared because his issues are quite real. We had a great friendship, so he was very, very hesitant -- but it was confusing for me because he would be flirtatious. CNN: So, do you think men and women can ever be just friends?

"(CNN) -- On paper, Katie Pietrak was a success story throughout her 20s. She had her own home, a new car, a large, beloved collection of vinyl records and a six-figure salary from her job in the pharmaceutical industry. But she didn't love what she was doing. ""I bought my first house when I was 21 but I wasn't happy. I kind of knew that all along but I did it because of financial stability,"" Pietrak said. ""I was afraid to think outside of the box because of money."" It took losing her job in 2010 for her to change her tune and launch a business doing something she enjoyed. Since 2011, Pietrak has been combining her enthusiasm for vintage records and bookbinding through her small business, Vintage Vinyl Journals. She finds old records, repurposes them into book covers and makes them into journals for music lovers. ""Everyone knows I was always making trinkets,"" Pietrak says. ""It wasn't too hard of a transition for me since I had both the craft and business side."" To make it happen, she had to leave corporate America behind and downsize from her three-bedroom home to a one-bedroom apartment. Now, she lives in a barn on her parents' property in a small town in Pennsylvania, dividing her time between raising an infant and building a business. It's worth the sacrifice to have control over her work and her life, said Pietrak, 34. Besides, now she has an entire studio where she gives old records a second life. ""I'm such a different person now,"" she said. Pietrak always has been interested in vintage items and antiques. As a teen, when her friends were buying CDs and cassettes, she was sifting through boxes of 15-cent records at yard sales and flea markets. When she left her parents' home, she took her large collection with her. She pursued a bachelor's degree from La Salle University in Philadelphia and later earned her MBA from St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. She continued to collect vinyl as her career took off. When the records became too scratched for listening, she didn't want to get rid of them, but how could she use them? While she was looking for a journal to jot down ideas, ""something clicked"" and she was inspired to find a way to incorporate her languishing records into a notebook. ""I got in my car, drove to Barnes and Noble and sat in the aisle reading almost everything I found about bookbinding,"" she said. She began crafting journals for friends and family and giving them as gifts to loved ones. After Pietrak was laid off, she decided to turn her journal-making hobby into a career. To fund start-up costs, she did temporary contract work and drew from her savings so she could eventually devote all her efforts to Vintage Vinyl Journals. She crops the album covers herself and contracts out the laser-cutting of the vinyl. She sews the journal pages together and attaches them to the cover using an acid-free adhesive. The average price of one of Pietrak's journals is $35, depending on the price of the vinyl. Custom designs requiring records that are hard to obtain cost a bit more. She used to think of them as simply journals, but over time she's seen people use them for a variety of purposes. ""People use them for wedding guest sign-in books, scrapbooks, drawing, books to store concert ticket stubs and photos -- stuff I never thought of,"" Pietrak says. After being in business for six months, she realized she would have to scale back living expenses to get the business off the ground. She and her boyfriend (now her husband) moved into an apartment and she sold many of her belongings. After two years in the apartment, they moved into her parents' barn to accommodate their growing family. Her life is much simpler now than when she was a ""corporate, hungry, heel-wearing person,"" she said. She can work and focus on her daughter while tending to new passions, like gardening and beekeeping. Running her business is a full-time job, even if it doesn't provide enough income to support her family; her husband has an outside job. There have been the typical ups and downs of being a small-business owner and entrepreneur, especially in learning how to market her products, she said. But ""not a day goes by"" when she regrets her decision. Her vinyl journals are sold in stores across the United States and Canada. She used to attend craft shows to sell her product and find retailers, but as sales have grown through her website, she has been able to travel less. Her success has led her to pursue new business ventures, too, including an apparel line, Lucky Penny, named for her daughter, that will launch next month. Her dream now is to see her product on the shelves of larger retailers, like Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie. ""Either way,"" she says, ""it's exciting finally having my own business.""","Through Vintage Vinyl Journals, Katie Pietrak transforms old records into notebooks .

"(CNN) -- Photographs purportedly showing the blood-spattered bathroom where Olympian Oscar Pistorius fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp have emerged, apparently showing the scene of the killing for the first time. The photos surfaced just days before the double amputee track star is due to appear in court, charged with murdering Steenkamp in his Pretoria home in the early hours of February 14. The images published by Sky News show a trail of blood leading from a bathroom; blood on the walls, stairs and a couch inside the house, and a Valentine's Day card with ""Ozzy"" written on it -- Steenkamp's nickname for her sprinter boyfriend. CNN EXCLUSIVE: Uncle says Pistorius 'heartbroken' The photo of the bathroom shows a toilet covered in blood, a door with a missing panel and what appear to be two police-marked bullet holes below the level of the door's handle. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the photos, and police spokesman Brigadiere Phuti Setati declined to comment on how Sky News obtained the pictures. The runner says he thought there was an intruder in the house and, fearful of being attacked, ran on his stumps to the bathroom, where he shot through the door from a relatively low angle four times. It was only upon returning to his bedroom, Pistorius says, that he realized Steenkamp was not in bed and that she had been the one in the bathroom. The state says it was premeditated murder -- that Pistorius had an argument with Steenkamp then put on his prosthetic legs, walked to the bathroom, and shot through the door from a relatively higher angle, intentionally killing his girlfriend. CNN's Robyn Curnow says a number of questions remain about the photos. ""The door was removed quickly from the scene of the crime, but appears to have been reconstructed here, so it's unclear when the photos were taken and whether this is a reconstruction. ""These photos have also not been seen by Oscar Pistorius' legal team, and their release to journalists will raise questions about whether police corruption may have been involved,"" she said. The police investigation into the killing has been beset by problems and scandals since the start. Hilton Botha, the original lead investigator, admitted during Pistorius' bail hearing that police had failed to wear protective shoe covers at the crime scene because they had run out of them, and that it was possible evidence had been damaged as a result. Botha also drew audible gasps from the packed courtroom when he testified that testosterone had been found at Pistorius' house, before being forced to admit that he hadn't actually read the full name of the substance. The sprinter's lawyers testified that the substance was an herbal remedy. The Paralympian's lawyers also got Botha to acknowledge that investigators had failed to collect any evidence that counters Pistorius' argument that he mistakenly shot Steenkamp. Things took a turn for the surreal near the end of the bail hearing when it emerged that Botha himself had been charged with seven counts of attempted murder for firing on a minibus full of people in 2011. Those charges had been withdrawn pending further investigation, but prosecutors reinstated them and he was pulled off the Pistorius case the day before the sprinter was granted bail. Curnow says the timing of the release of the crime scene photos is especially significant, given that prosecutors are expected to ask magistrates next week to postpone the case pending further investigations. ""A legal expert has told me all indications are that the state's case against Pistorius is really quite thin at the moment,"" Curnow said. ""It's possible that the publication of these photos will delay the trial still further."" Police spokesman Setati told CNN: ""Nothing will distract the detectives from the case. They will remain on course to make sure that they secure a murder conviction."" CNN Wires contributed to this report.","Photos of crime scene in Pistorius' house emerge for first time .

Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, suffered an aneurysm Tuesday evening. Tubbs Jones, a 58-year-old Democrat in her fifth term representing parts of Cleveland and its suburbs, suffered the aneurysm Tuesday evening while driving in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, her staff said. She was rushed to East Cleveland's Huron Hospital, where a team of doctors determined Wednesday morning that she had ""very limited brain function,"" said Dr. Gus Kious, the hospital's chief of staff. Wednesday afternoon, before Tubbs Jones died, Kious said that the aneurysm was in ""an inaccessible part of her brain"" and that she was in critical condition. She died at 6:12 p.m. ET Wednesday after her condition declined ""throughout the course of the day and into this evening,"" according to a joint statement from her family, Huron Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic. The congresswoman had a full day of activity Tuesday, according to a statement from her office, including planning for a September 4 forum on electoral reform at Cleveland State University. President Bush said Tubbs Jones ""was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses, improving local schools, expanding job opportunities for Ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care.

She said she voted ""no"" because the resolution connected Iraq to the September 11 terrorist attacks and declared that Iraq poses a continued threat to the United States. She said that neither of those claims had been proved. ""Our veterans deserve better than lip service,"" she said. She stepped up her national political role in 2004, assisting the presidential campaign of Sen. John Kerry, especially in battleground states. She also helped shape her party's platform, traveling the country as a co-chair of the Democratic National Committee. In early January 2005, Tubbs Jones led an unsuccessful fight against certifying Ohio's tally in the 2004 presidential election, citing voting irregularities. Lawmakers voted down the challenge, allowing President Bush to carry the state by about 70,000 votes and sealing his 286-251 victory in the Electoral College. Tubbs Jones was one of the most ardent supporters of Sen. Hillary Clinton's 2008 run for the White House. After Clinton bowed out of the race in June, she endorsed Sen. Barack Obama, now the presumptive Democratic nominee. Tubbs Jones, a superdelegate, had been scheduled to attend the Democratic National Convention next week in Denver, Colorado. ""She was not only a professional, but she could reach into your soul and shake it,"" said Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pennsylvania, who said he met Tubbs Jones at a Clinton rally.

"(CNN) -- Rumors about John Edwards' love affair had been circulating for months, but it wasn't until the former Democratic presidential candidate admitted to the affair that national news organizations jumped on the story. John Edwards admitted Friday that he had an affair with Rielle Hunter in 2006. After the National Enquirer reported catching Edwards making a late-night visit to see his ex-mistress last month, the blogosphere exploded, asking why the mainstream media was not reporting the story. Was it because of a condescending attitude toward a tabloid's reporting? Bias toward a Democratic candidate? Or sympathy toward Elizabeth Edwards, who is battling an incurable form of cancer? David Carr, a columnist for The New York Times, said many news organizations ""tend to pick up stories from the National Enquirer with tongs."" ""They have been very right about some things ... but there's been some misses too, so it's a little scary to follow on those stories,"" he said Sunday on CNN's Reliable Sources. ""It's also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this. Sex may sell, but it can really hurt your relationship with readers,"" he added. Enquirer editor David Perel said his organization feels a ""big sense of vindication"" now that Edwards has admitted to the affair. In an interview Friday with ABC, Edwards confessed to having an affair with Rielle Hunter, but he denied the Enquirer's claim that he fathered her child. He also said he told his family about the ""liaison"" in 2006.  Watch more on Rielle Hunter » . The former vice presidential candidate was first confronted about the allegations after the Enquirer reported the affair in October. ""The story is false, it's completely untrue, it's ridiculous,"" he said. Edwards on Friday said he used the fact that the Enquirer story ""contained many falsities"" to deny it. ""But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough,"" he said in a statement. Asked by CNN's Howard Kurtz if sympathy for Elizabeth Edwards played any part in an apparent reluctance to report the story, ABC correspondent Kate Snow said no. ""We at ABC were working on this story, and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts, we certainly would have gone with the story,"" she said. ""It was just a matter of, we're not going to put something on the air until we know that it's true."" On this particular story, most major news networks took the stance that the rumors of an affair were not newsworthy. iReport.com: Your thoughts on the Edwards scandal . Brian Ross, ABC's chief investigative correspondent, said his investigative team was pushing hard following the money trail, looking at such things as who paid for Hunter's fancy California home and the use of campaign funds. He said that even without Edwards' admission, ABC probably would have been able to run a story about the issue this week.  Watch what's next for Edwards » . ""We were able to prove, I think with satisfaction to our bosses, that there was money being paid to Rielle Hunter,"" Ross said. ""This began to be, for us, an aspect of something we could report -- some hard facts."" Edwards has denied giving any money to Hunter. Fred Baron, the finance chairman for the Edwards presidential campaign, said he paid to help Hunter move out of the former North Carolina senator's home state and did not tell Edwards about the assistance. As Ross worked on the money angle, his colleague Bob Woodruff landed an interview with Edwards. With Edwards' on-camera admission, the story changed from a rumored affair to a former presidential candidate caught in a lie.  Watch more on Edwards' admission » . ""Until he called -- and it's on the record that he called us on Friday and said, 'I want to talk.' You know, that's what broke the story. He was willing to admit that he had been lying,"" Snow said. Kurtz said news organizations were clinging to a very important standard: Don't run allegations that you can't prove. ""But it became a ludicrous situation ... almost became a conspiracy of silence by the media. And Edwards, meanwhile, would not give interviews, was not acting like a man who didn't have something to hide. ""I think at that point we should have -- earlier than we did -- told readers and viewers what we knew and we didn't know,"" he said. In the ABC interview, Edwards also acknowledged meeting with Hunter at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California, at the request of a friend of hers last month. He said a blurry photograph published by the Enquirer that purportedly showed him holding Hunter's child inside the hotel room could not be authentic, since the baby was not present at their meeting. He also said he is ""truly hopeful"" that a paternity test will be done to squelch the rumors that he fathered the child. A former Edwards campaign aide, Andrew Young, has publicly said the child is his. Speaking through her lawyer Saturday, Hunter said she would not participate in any sort of DNA testing. Edwards said Friday he ""will have nothing more to say"" about the allegations. But with questions still looming about the identity of the child's father and the Enquirer standing by its reporting, the blogosphere will probably keep this story alive. ""I was taught when I was a young reporter that it's news when we say it is. I think that's still true -- it's news when 'we' say it is. It's just who 'we' is has changed,"" Carr said. ""Members of the public, people with modems, people with cell phones are now producers, editors. They can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone.""","John Edwards admitted Friday that he had an affair in 2006 .

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- Wearing a stylish red dress and a beaming smile, celebrated fashion designer Adama Paris sits comfortably inside her spacious living room in Dakar, the vibrant seaside capital of Senegal, as we discuss her inspirations. ""My designing process starts always with me,"" explains Paris. ""With what I want to wear; with what is in my closet -- my style is multi-cultural, it's eclectic, it's the mix of my travels, it's bold, it's rocky,"" she adds. ""It's African."" Indeed, for more than a decade the Senegalese designer has been putting African fashion to global runways and clothing stores -- from New York and London to Paris and Tokyo. But besides spreading her stylish vision around the world, Paris is also bringing attention closer to home -- 12 years ago she founded Dakar Fashion Week, a popular event allowing designers from all over West Africa and beyond to showcase their colorful creations to fashion lovers and international media. ""The fashion scene in Senegal is so bold,"" says Paris, whose real name is Adama Amanda Ndiaye. ""I have seen it grow like a baby and I am so proud to be a part of this."" Black Fashion Week . Following the initial success of the Dakar Fashion week, Paris began receiving invitations to attend big designers' shows in fashion capitals like London and New York. But whilst there, she quickly started feeling like an outsider. ""I was really frustrated,"" she says. ""When I looked around there were so few black models and I felt like I wasn't belonging there."" That frustration was behind Paris' decision to start Black Fashion Week in 2010 to help promote the talented black designers and models that she felt were being ignored by the industry. Paris held the inaugural event in the Czech Republic, followed by editions in Paris, Montreal, Geneva and Bahia. ""I thought it was right ... to try to do something to help my own people and to get more exposure,"" she says. ""It was not saying them they were wrong, it was saying, 'OK, we are here,'"" adds Paris. ""It was also a statement [to] the fashion industry, 'stop this discrimination, black is beautiful.' I am sick and tired of seeing only skinny blonde girls and not black women in the runway."" From the runway to the TV screen . The daughter of diplomats, Paris spent much of her childhood traveling and soaking up other cultures before finally settling in France where she attended college. She first made a name for herself in the French capital but decided to bring her fashion home to Senegal in 2001. Now, with a thriving label and flourishing annual events under her belt, the fashion entrepreneur is taking on her next business venture -- TV. A two-year project in the making, Paris has had her heart set on creating a new avenue to promote local fashion talent. Starting with a reality show she describes as the ""equivalent of America's Next Top Model,"" Paris wants to provide new opportunities for aspiring young models from the continent. ""We wanted really young girls and give them [an] opportunity to go outside Senegal to model in Africa -- South Africa, Angola [and] also in Europe. This is going to be a big deal because it is probably going to start their career."" Her other goal is to introduce viewers to alternative fashion designers. While there are currently channels devoted to fashion, Paris explains that they don't show enough African inspiration and when they do, coverage tends to focus on designers from South Africa. ""I want them to see us in Nigeria, Ghana, Dakar. That was the purpose of this channel,"" she says. ""I want people to see we have great designers. And that's what I'm going to show -- Africans wearing African clothes,"" adds Paris. Fashion made in Africa by Africans.""

"(CNN) -- Ronald Gray raped and battered at least seven women. He killed four, and left the others for dead -- the bodies dumped around Fort Bragg and the neighboring city of Fayetteville, North Carolina, between 1986 and 1987. He was caught and, just as in the civilian system, he was tried. He was found guilty by a jury of his peers, just as in the civilian system. And a death sentence was passed, just as would have been possible in a civilian court for such a heinous crime. But when it comes to staying alive, history is on Gray's side. The U.S. military has not executed one of its own since 1961. The former soldier came close to being put to death in 2008, when then President George W. Bush signed a warrant authorizing Gray's execution -- a requirement for capital punishment in the military. A federal court gave Gray a last-minute temporary stay, and today he -- along with four other former servicemen -- remains on the military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan may become the next resident of the military's death row, if he is convicted for the shooting rampage at Fort Hood that killed 13 people and sentenced to death. Opening statements in the murder trial are scheduled to begin August 6. Legal issues, including whether cases were handled appropriately, have affected some cases, analysts say. A look at the last U.S. soldier executed by the military . But a larger part of the equation appears to be the sometimes cloistered military culture, from a commanding general who can override a jury's verdict to the routine military reshuffling of personnel, including prosecutors, defense attorneys and witnesses, every two or three years. ""The military is a community of solidarity, a brotherhood and sisterhood, all to its own,"" defense lawyer Teresa Norris said. ""There is a real reluctance to execute fellow soldiers unless it's absolutely the worst kind of case and this is the only way."" There is little disagreement by the Army that the death penalty is used only in extreme cases. But that doesn't mean it won't mete out or carry out the punishment, it says. ""Adherence to the law, due process, and respect for the rights of someone accused of crime, combined with respect for civilian oversight of the military justice system, should not be mistaken for an unwillingness to execute the law,"" said Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. Military terror convictions to get high-profile judicial review . 'The Castle' Norris represents former Army Pfc. Dwight Loving, sentenced to death in 1989 when he was 21 years old for robbing and murdering two cab drivers -- a retired sergeant and a soldier moonlighting to earn extra money -- at Fort Hood, Texas. Sent to an intimidating prison with a brick faÃ§ade at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Loving for a time was expected to be the first person the military put to death in decades. Military officers and other important types were shown where he was kept in the stark prison known as ""the Castle,"" reserved for the worst of the worst and the inspiration for a book and later a movie, ""The Last Castle,"" starring Robert Redford as a court-martialed general. They were told, Norris says, that Loving would soon be executed. That was 1992. Today, ""the Castle"" has been rendered obsolete, and Loving is awaiting execution in a new, state-of-the-art military prison. ""Me and my client were essentially expecting an execution within 18 months, and here we are all these years later,"" said Norris, who represented Loving as a military defense attorney and now as a civilian. Executing troops . The U.S. military has executed 135 men since 1916 -- considered the start of the era of the modern fighting force -- for crimes ranging from murder to rape, according to the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C. Only 10 of these executions have taken place since 1951. The U.S. military carried out its last execution on April 13, 1961, with the hanging of Army Pvt. John A. Bennett, who was convicted in 1955 of the rape and attempted murder of an 11-year-old Austrian girl. A number of death sentences were converted to life sentences in 1983 when a military appeals court found the death penalty was unconstitutional because of problems with the armed forces' sentencing guidelines. A year later, President Ronald Reagan reinstated capital punishment in the military. Of the 16 people sent to the military's death row since 1984, 11 have had their sentences overturned. Two of those decisions were taken by commanding generals. The other nine cases were overturned by military appeals courts over various questions about the application of law. Unlike in civilian courts where prosecutors decide charges, a commanding general -- who has other duties -- decides whether a military defendant will face the death penalty. That general also can reduce a sentence. It's one of the biggest differences with the civilian system and it leads to one of the major criticisms of the decentralized nature of the military judicial system, where each branch operates independently. ""Even if you have two identical cases, one being prosecuted by one commander at one base and other being prosecuted by a commander at another base, you may have different outcomes because the commanders may have different philosophies,"" said Dwight Sullivan, a former Marine prosecutor and judge who now works as a civilian attorney specializing in military death penalty appeals. Such was the case with Curtis Allen Gibbs, a Marine who was sentenced to death in 1990 for killing and nearly decapitating a woman with a sword near Camp Lejeune. A jury returned a sentence of death for Gibbs, but a commanding general overturned the decision and gave him life. At the time, the general cited a reluctance to authorize the execution of a service member during a military conflict -- the Persian Gulf War, according to published accounts. ""He didn't want to impose the death penalty, and it struck me as strange because the jury had heard and evaluated all the evidence and decided that's what he should get,"" said Guy Womack, a retired Marine prosecutor who helmed the Gibbs case. As a result, Womack believes the problem lies not with military juries but rather with what follows: the commanding general and the appeals process. Once the death penalty has been handed down, an appeal is automatic and eventually reviewed by the military's top court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces -- even if the service member doesn't want it. ""It's a very slow process, and I don't think they like the idea of confirming the death penalty,"" said Womack, who now works as a civilian attorney who specializes in defending military clients. Today, the death sentences of all five men on the military's death row are either on appeal or under legal review. ""The process by which legal matters in the military are adjudicated are taken extraordinarily seriously by a professional panel of peers that weigh all matters and due consideration at their due course,"" said Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman. Military chiefs oppose removing commanders from sexual assault probes . Fewer cases . If the Gulf War affected the Gibbs case, it may also have had a wider impact. The 1990-1991 conflict was the first major deployment of U.S. troops since Vietnam and may have made the military switch its focus, says Catherine Grosso, who co-authored a study that examined the military death penalty system. She found fewer death penalty cases brought by the military in recent decades. ""The important break point in the study is 1990,"" she said. Grosso did not come to conclusions for why this happened in her study, which addressed racial questions. But she told CNN that while legal changes in 1997 could have played a role by adding the option of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, it doesn't explain the drop in death penalty prosecutions before 1997. That's where the buildup to and fighting of the Gulf War, from 1990-1991 may have played a role. ""Maybe that made the military focus in a different way,"" she said. But Eugene Fidell, a former judge advocate who teaches military justice at Yale Law School, said there is ""insufficient data to draw a broad conclusion."" ""Anyone who commits multiple murders is a viable candidate for a capital prosecution, regardless of the setting,"" he said. ""The more victims, the likelier."" Present day . Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty last month to avoid the death penalty for killing 16 Afghan civilians in Kandahar in March 2012. Most legal experts agree the case against Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of opening fire in 2009 at a deployment center at Fort Hood, will be tough to overcome -- given the evidence. ""This is broad daylight, multiple assaults before witnesses on a base,"" Fidell said. ""As capital cases go, this is an easy one."" But whether a jury hands down a death sentence remains to be seen. And whether any death sentence is carried out is even more at question. Hagel orders review of military judicial authority .","Five men are on the military's death row .

"Miami (CNN) -- Two South Florida imams and a third family member were arrested Saturday on charges of providing support to the Pakistani Taliban, the Justice Department said. In addition, three others in Pakistan were also indicted on the same charges. FBI agents arrested Hafiz Khan and his son Izhar Khan in South Florida, the department said. They are expected to make their initial court appearance in federal court on Monday. Another of Hafiz Khan's sons, Irfan Khan, was arrested in Los Angeles and will appear in court there. Also charged are three Pakistani residents: Ali Rehman, Alam Zeb, and Amina Khan. Amina Khan is Hafiz Khan's daughter, and Zeb is his grandson. The four-count indictment alleges that all six defendants conspired to provide material support to a conspiracy to kill, injure and kidnap people abroad, and that they provided support to the Pakistani Taliban. Hafiz Khan is the imam at Flagler Mosque in Miami. Izhar Khan, is an imam at the Jamaat Al-Mu'mineen Mosque in Margate, Florida. ""Despite being an imam, or spiritual leader, Hafiz Khan was by no means a man of peace. Instead, as today's charges show, he acted with others to support terrorists to further acts of murder, kidnapping and maiming,"" U.S. Attorney Wilfredo A. Ferrer said. ""But for law enforcement intervention, these defendants would have continued to transfer funds to Pakistan to finance the Pakistani Taliban, including its purchase of guns."" The indictment describes a number of occasions where Hafiz Khan transferred money to Pakistan, and where money was withdrawn once there. ""Khan solicited and distributed funds for the Pakistani Taliban, both personally and on behalf of others, and worked with the co-defendants and others to support the Pakistani Taliban's jihad,"" the indictment states. The court documents also list several conversations between Hafiz Khan and the other defendants where he calls for attacks against the Pakistani government and inquires whether money had been delivered to the Pakistani Taliban. The elder Khan also built a madrassa in Pakistan's Swat Valley that provided shelter for the terrorist group, the indictment states. The Pakistani Taliban represent a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, said Bill Roggio, military-affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. Those fighters attack targets in Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan. The group, which is headquartered in Quetta, is different from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, he said.","Hafiz Khan and two sons arrested .

"(CNN) -- Since taking the helm of Yahoo after years in Google's upper echelon, Marissa Mayer has been at the center of plenty of talk not focused on turning around the once-mighty Web giant. As Silicon Valley's most prominent woman, her appearance, her motherhood and the way her policies will affect female employees have all, fairly or not, been the subject of spirited discussion. Now, a two-page photo spread in September's Vogue magazine has them talking again. In the photo, Mayer lies upside-down on a backyard lounge chair, wearing a blue Michael Kors dress. Her blond hair fans out at the foot of the chair, her Yves Saint Laurent stiletto heels point toward the top and she holds a tablet computer featuring a stylized image of her face. In the minds of some, that single image is enough to undo a 3,000-word article -- the first in-depth interview Mayer has granted since taking the reins at Yahoo -- that focuses on her successes and vision in a male-dominated tech world. ""Nothing says, 'I'm a powerful woman' like a photo of you upside down on a weird couch,"" Stan Horaczek, an editor at Popular Photography, said on Twitter. ""Nice work, Vogue."" ""Being equal means you can be (feminine) AND smart,"" wrote online business consultant Angie McKaig. ""However, still wincing over Marissa Mayer all stretched out for Vogue."" Some people focused less on the photo and main article than they did on what they deemed a questionable sidebar piece titled ""What Would Marissa Mayer Wear?: A Workweek Guide to Office Dressing."" ""Marissa Mayer's ascent up the corporate ladder and to the top of the tech world are enough to make her the mentor every working woman wants,"" the piece reads. ""But her uncanny ability to perfectly answer that age-old fashion question: What is work-appropriate? is equally worth emulating."" It follows with a five-panel slideshow of outfits presumably inspired by Mayer. ""Oy... "" read the one-sound review of Slate economics reporter Matt Yglesias on Twitter. Mayer has made no secret of her love for design and fashion. The article, in which writer and Slate Group editor-in-chief Jacob Weisberg calls her an ""unusually stylish geek,"" is her second appearance in Vogue, following a 2009 feature when she was one of Google's top leaders. READ: How Marissa Mayer makes her own rules . Much of the online response on Monday, the first day other publications could run the image, remained focused on the article itself, with much of it praising Mayer and the steps she has taken to begin a turnaround at a once-faltering Yahoo. Others said the photo, like it or not, shouldn't take away from the overall look at Mayer's life and career. Anna Holmes, founder of women's website Jezebel, argued in a column for Time that ""women who hold any position of authority get it coming and going"" when it comes to their appearance. Ignore it? You lack self-respect. Focus on it? You're superficial. If anything, she writes, Mayer's photo and other recent debates ""make me yearn for a time when female competence in one area is not undermined by enthusiasm for another -- in which women in positions of power are so commonplace that we do not feel compelled to divine motive or find symbolism in every remark they make, corporate policy they enact or fashion spread they pose for."" In the article, in which Mayer reveals a fondness for even numbers, cashmere boleros, pineapple milkshakes and Candy Crush, she also provides insight into her first year at Yahoo's helm. Who works from home and how they do it . On her vision for Yahoo: ""Close your eyes and listen to this list. E-mail, maps, weather, news, stock quotes, share photos, group communication, sport scores, games. You're listening to what people do on their mobile phones. And it sounds like a list of what Yahoo does."" On buying blogging site Tumblr: ""I've done now between three and four dozen acquisitions in my career ... and I've never seen this kind of lock-and-key fit between two companies. Our demographic is older. Theirs is the youngest on the Web."" On her controversial move to end work-from-home at Yahoo: (In a conversation with Web investor and pioneer Esther Dyson) ""Mayer elaborates, a little defensively, on her reasons for the change. She never meant it as any kind of larger statement about society, but simply as the right decision for Yahoo, where by various accounts working from home often meant hardly working. Teams are happier now that absent participants don't teleconference in for meetings. Messages on Yahoo's 'devel-random' e-mail list, the company's informal forum, have lately turned positive. And in perhaps the clearest sign of support, employees have, she tells Dyson, 'stopped leaking my e-mails' to the press."" On getting ahead in Silicon Valley: ""I didn't set out to be at the top of technology companies. I'm just geeky and shy and I like to code. ... It's not like I had a grand plan where I weighed all the pros and cons of what I wanted to doâ€”it just sort of happened.""","Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is the subject of a 3,000-word profile in Vogue .

"(CNN) -- Siri can help you find drugstores and bars, but the iPhone 4S digital assistant is clueless when it comes to the locations of abortion clinics, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The advocacy group this week launched an online petition asking people to send e-mails to Apple saying that ""if Siri can tell us about Viagra, it should not provide bad or no information about contraceptives or abortion care. Send a message to Apple: Fix Siri."" ""Although it isn't clear that Apple is intentionally trying to promote an anti-choice agenda, it is distressing that Siri can point you to Viagra, but not the Pill, or help you find an escort, but not an abortion clinic,"" the group wrote in a blog post Wednesday. ""We're confident that the developers at Apple want to provide iPhone users with accurate information."" Apple said Thursday the omission was not intentional: . ""Our customers want to use Siri to find out all types of information and while it can find a lot, it doesn't always find what you want,"" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Harrison said. ""These are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone. It simply means that as we bring Siri from beta to a final product, we find places where we can do better and we will in the coming weeks."" In an informal test by CNN, Siri was able to provide some information about reproductive health services, including where you can buy a condom, but she still could not answer the question, ""Where can I get an abortion?"" The digital assistant's reply: ""Sorry, I couldn't find any abortion clinics."" When asked about Planned Parenthood, a group that provides reproductive health services, including abortions, Siri was able to locate a nearby clinic. Similarly, when asked where you could buy a condom, Siri recommended nearby drugstores. The virtual assistant was unable to decipher a request for the ""morning-after pill."" The Siri abortion questions started to become a point of online conversation this week, with bloggers raising the point that Siri was unable to locate abortion clinics. ""If abortion information is plentifully available on the interwebs, and Siri is pulling those types of requests from the Web, why does Siri not have an answer about birth control or abortion?"" one blogger wrote on a site called The Abortioneers. On a blog called Raw Story, Megan Carpentier wrote: . ""In New York City, Siri doesn't know what Plan B is and, asked for emergency contraception, offers up a Google results page of definitions.""

"(CNN) -- In 1987, an anguished, trembling Joy White pleaded for someone to help her find her infant daughter. ""I hope she's all right,"" the heartbroken mother told reporters at the time before collapsing in tears. Now, 23 years later, White is crying tears of joy as the decades-long mystery of her missing daughter reached a happy ending. Searching for a missing loved one? Share your story, photos . The saga started on August 4, 1987, when White took her sick baby, Carlina, to a Harlem hospital because of an extremely high fever, a New York police official said. Carlina was admitted in the hospital and White went home to rest. When the mother returned, Carlina was gone. Years passed as White searched for her daughter, all the time holding onto a photograph of a baby girl she had only held for three weeks. On January 4, White's phone rang. The woman on the other end of the line said she was Carlina, and she sent White a picture taken in 1987. The face in the photograph bore a striking resemblance to that of the baby in the tattered picture White had held on to. Police, too, agreed that the photographs looked alike and carried out a DNA test. On Tuesday, the results came back -- and they were a match. ""Carlina was a missing link,"" Pat Conway, Carlina White's aunt, told CNN affiliate WABC as she raised her hands in the air. ""We have gotten her back. In the name of Jesus, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah."" For her part, Carlina Renae White, had nursed a nagging feeling that she was raised by a family to which she did not belong, said Ernie Allen from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Raised under a different name, Carlina grew suspicious when the woman who raised her could not provide her with a birth certificate. So she scoured the internet for answers, stumbling on the website of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. There, she came across an item about a baby girl who had been taken from a New York hospital. She called the center, which in turn notified authorities. Authorities are not saying much about the woman who raised Carlina White as they continue their investigation. ""I never gave up hope,"" Carlina White's grandmother, Elizabeth, told WABC. ""It is like she has been around us all her life. She wasn't a stranger. She fit right in.""

"(CNN) -- Though the attacks have been relatively rare and the bombings in Boston on Monday were shocking, Americans are not total strangers to terror attacks at home. Here is a list of the terror attacks on U.S. soil since 1980 that involved casualties: . 1978-1995: Three people die and 23 others are wounded after a string of mail bombings carried out by Ted Kaczynski. ""The Unabomber,"" as he is also known, is serving eight life sentences for murder. He was not charged with terrorism, but the string of bombings is considered to be a terror case. February 26, 1993: A bomb explodes on the second subterranean level of Vista International Hotel's public parking garage, below the 2 World Trade Center building.

"(AOL Autos) -- Tough times call for tough measures. Nowhere is this truer than in Detroit's auto industry. News of General Motors -- once America's largest commercial enterprise -- possibly going out of business or eliminating divisions sends shudders through Wall Street and cities where GM employees work. But what about current owners of GM vehicles? What does this news mean to them? To find out, AOL Autos pushed aside the crisis mentality of the moment to take a clear-headed look at the situation. Our editorial team closely follows the business side of General Motors and is aware that GM will take definitive action regarding four vehicle divisions: Pontiac, HUMMER, Saab, and Saturn. Pontiac . For Pontiac fans, the good news is that Pontiac will not go the way of Desoto, Oakland, Merkur, Edsel, and Plymouth. Sources at GM officially state that Pontiac is secure, thanks to the reorganization started a decade ago that combined most Pontiac dealerships with Buick and GMC Truck outlets. This consolidation enables Pontiac to remain a brand that will mostly focus on sporty offerings. The narrow product range is made possible because Buick specializes in mainstream sedans, while GMC covers SUVs, crossovers and trucks, giving Buick/Pontiac/GMC dealers a full-line portfolio. While we hope for a new Pontiac Firebird to be revealed now that the Chevrolet Camaro is about to go on sale, the reality is different at Pontiac. Their next new vehicle will be the tiny, fuel-efficient G3, a re-badged Chevy Aveo that is itself an Americanized version of a Dewoo built in Korea. So while Pontiac's future is not in question, whether it will stay true to its performance heritage is. HUMMER . Launched during the time in America when drivers clamored for the biggest and baddest vehicles on the planet, GM figured that the HUMMER craze would last forever. Especially unfortunate for business owners who invested millions in stylish, stand-alone HUMMER dealerships in expensive locations, the craze crashed quickly. According to John McDonald from GM Communications, the fate of HUMMER is uncertain. Come March 31, GM will decide whether to sell HUMMER or phase the brand out. The Detroit rumor mill is curiously still regarding potential HUMMER suitors. The global nature of the economic downturn seems to have squashed overtures from Indian, Chinese, and Russian buyers. Regardless of which path GM takes, owners of existing HUMMERs can rest assured that their vehicles will continue to be covered under warranty, and that parts will remain available through other GM brand dealerships for years. General Motors has experience shedding divisions and shut down the Oldsmobile brand in 2001. Plenty of Oldsmobiles are still on the road today, and continue to receive service through GM dealers and the independent aftermarket industry. Likewise, when Ford bid auf wiedersehen to their German Merkur brand or when Chrysler furled the sails on Plymouth, owners of these vehicles weren't suddenly cast adrift. Service and parts remain available for these brands today. Given this historical fact, HUMMER owners have little to fear. Saab . General Motors acquired Saab when American car companies thought that snapping up prestigious European brands would be good for business. Chrysler bought Lamborghini. Ford snapped up Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, and Aston Martin. GM satisfied itself with Saab. Unfortunately, these decisions proved financially disastrous for the Americans. None of the European brands became usefully profitable, and the majority continued to hemorrhage cubic dollars right through the time when every nameplate but Volvo and Saab was sold with terrific losses. In 1990, when GM initially invested in Saab, the thinking was that GM could help improve Saab's quality and overall refinement, while the Swedish brand would add some luster to GM's generally dull product portfolio. The plan worked to an extent, but the sales of the improved Saabs never grew large enough to create a positive dollar return for GM. Now, because of GM's lack of cash, the corporation can't continue to support the Saab franchise. At the moment, Saab is reorganizing to become a separate, independent business entity. The concept is something like a management buy out, and the Swedish government may provide some of the funding to finance Saab's breakaway from General Motors. Regardless of how the company engineers its independence, Saab is likely to continue to maintain a presence in the U.S. This should assuage fears of GM-era Saab owners that their warranties will be invalidated and that parts will suddenly become unavailable. It is standard industry practice for customer service issues to be fully addressed during corporate transitions because keeping current owners happy is the easiest way to ensure future purchases. In the worst-case scenario where Saab reorganizes and exits the U.S. market, experience indicates that an independent service and parts network will quickly surface to meet the needs of abandoned Saab owners. For instance, if one knows where to look, parts for Rovers, Peugeots, Alfa Romeos, and Fiats can be acquired in America with little difficulty. Saturn . In the beginning, Saturn was supposed to be a different kind of car sold by a different kind of car company. For a few years in the early 1990s, Saturn fulfilled this promise. Unfortunately, Saturn's parent (GM) proceeded to neglect its offspring's new-product portfolio and Saturn cars became uncompetitive. The brand floundered. Resuscitation came recently as the vehicles in Saturn showrooms went from outdated to outstanding seemingly overnight. Even though Saturn's product line is once again healthy, GM and Saturn will change their relationship in several years. General Motor's plan for Saturn is different from its other troubled nameplates. Saturn, and its strong, high-quality dealer network, is slated to become a sales distribution channel that is separate from General Motors. GM's John McDonald explains, ""Right now, Saturn sells re-engineered versions of vehicles produced by GM divisions worldwide. The Saturn Vue and Astra are from GM's German Opel division. The Saturn Outlook and Sky are produced domestically by GM."" Specifically, the Vue and Astra are versions of the Opel Antera and Opel Astra. The Outlook is a version of GM's full-size crossover family that includes the GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave, and Chevrolet Traverse, while the Sky is a rebodied Pontiac Solstice. In other words, Saturn doesn't now produce anything. They sell what others produce for them. McDonald continues, ""Saturn will continue to distribute vehicles, but the new Saturn organization will have the autonomy to source their new models from any manufacturer. GM will continue to provide products to Saturn through their expected life cycle that runs through the 2011 model year. What comes after that is an unknown right now."" In follow-up questions, McDonald hinted that Saturn could procure vehicles from non-GM affiliates in China or India if those manufacturers offered vehicles that fit Saturn's needs. Should GM owners be worried? According to most automotive industry watchers and professional economists, it's highly unlikely that the government will allow General Motors to disappear. According to GM's McDonald, regardless of which path GM takes toward survival, none would remove GM's commitment to provide warranty coverage and service for their owners, regardless of brand. Owners of Pontiacs, HUMMERs, Saabs, and Saturns can relax. The best deals . AOL Auto's contributor Gary Hoffman recently completed a story on the best March deals. We asked Gary if he had any strategies for finding the absolute best deals regarding these four GM brands. ""Create your own personal auction. If you are going after one of these brands, use the same approach that you would use in good times, except your results will be better. Arm yourself with the invoice pricing, the features you want, and start out by visiting at least three or four dealerships. Get one good offer, and take it to three or four more and see if anyone can beat it. If you aren't satisfied, head out to three or four more."" Gary adds, ""Don't be afraid to call your early dealerships back with your best deal and ask them if you can beat it. You will soon find the rock-bottom price for your vehicle."" A keen observer of the industry, Gary says, ""The phenomenally good deals available right now cut across all brands, not just those that are at risk of disappearing. I don't think GM has found the perfect incentives formula for moving iron off dealership lots in this environment."" Gary hints that better deals could come, but more lucrative incentives are unlikely because of substantial internal roadblocks for GM to offer negative-percentage rates or rebates equaling 25-percent of the price of the vehicle. Dealers borrow money to finance their stock of vehicles, and the cost related to these vehicles is referred to as ""floor plan."" ""When a customer makes a purchase during times like these, the purchase may actually save the dealer money,"" says Gary. ""If you don't buy the vehicle, that dealer has the lot, the dealer will continue losing money on that vehicle every day it sits. You're actually solving a problem for the dealer by purchasing a vehicle."" What the future holds for Detroit . Most manufacturers interviewed by AOL expect demand to pick up late this summer. GM's McDonald says, ""We believe that an annual sales volume of about 12.5 million vehicles just accounts for vehicle replacements, and the market sales rate is well below that today. Adding to this unrealized demand, about two million vehicles are scrapped every year, and the pool of U.S. licensed drivers grows by another two million."" McDonald and his counterparts at Volvo and Toyota/Lexus believe that because of the credit crunch, most would-be new-car buyers have postponed purchases for at least six months. The compounding of these individual decisions is causing a dramatic increase in pent-up demand for new vehicles. As credit eases and Americans are able to finance major purchases such as new cars and trucks, GM anticipates a huge upside. General Motors now produces more high-quality vehicles at competitive prices than ever before, so the company is poised for a comeback...even if it is without HUMMER or Saab.","With GM facing economic troubles, some car owners may be worried .
HUMMERS will continue under warranty, parts available at other dealers .
Saab is reorganizing to become a separate, independent business entity .

"(CNN) -- The ""lowest places in hell"" are reserved for people who force animals to fight, an Alabama district attorney said Monday after announcing that more than 350 pitbulls have been rescued from a massive illegal dogfighting ring. They rescued 367 pit bull terriers in Alabama and Georgia. Authorities arrested 11 people on Friday for violations of the federal dogfighting and gambling statutes. Warrants were executed and arrests were made in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas. The dogs were taken to temporary shelters in undisclosed locations. ""It's really a sad day to me and a sad day of affairs in the state of Alabama to have to even indulge in this type of criminal activity and prosecution,"" said U.S. Attorney George L. Beck Jr. ""I believe if Dante were alive today and were rewriting 'The Inferno,' that the lowest places in hell would be reserved for those who commit cruelty to our animals and to our children."" He was referring to ""The Divine Comedy,"" the epic poem by Dante Alighieri. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Montgomery, Alabama; the Auburn, Alabama, police; and the FBI teamed up with the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to investigate the dogfighting and free the canines from captivity. The result, the ASPCA said, was believed to be the second-largest dogfighting raid in U.S. history. ""Today, we ended the torture of hundreds of abused and neglected dogs,"" said Matt Bershadker, president and chief executive officer of the ASPCA. Many of the dogs appeared emaciated, the ASPCA said. Smugglers drive Thailand's grim trade in dog meat . ""In one yard, 114 dogs, the majority tethered to heavy chains, sat in 90 degree heat, scratching at fleas, with no fresh water or food visible anywhere on the property. Some appeared to have no access to water at all, and many exhibited wounds, scars and other conditions consistent with dogfighting,"" the ASPCA said in a statement. ""Makeshift, filthy doghouses -- many improvised from plastic and metal barrels and others made of chipboard with rotting wood floors and rusted metal roofing -- provided the only shelter in the sweltering heat and humidity. Some dogs pulled at chains and cables that were tethered to cinder blocks and car tires. A female dog did her best to tend to six puppies, just weeks old, with no food or water, in a pen littered with trash and feces."" A 30-count federal indictment charges that from 2009 to 2013, the 11 suspects conspired to promote and sponsor dogfighting and to possess, buy, sell, transport and deliver dogs for fighting. Agents seized $500,000 from dogfighters. ""These defendants were betting between $5,000 and $200,000 on one dogfight,"" Beck said. ""These dogfighters abuse, starve and kill their dogs for the supposed 'fun' of watching and gambling on a dogfight. Their behavior is deplorable, will not be tolerated, and will be punished to the full extent of the law."" Beck said the suspects, if convicted, could face ""lengthy"" prison terms.

"(CNN) -- Interpol has rebutted Malaysia's explanation for not checking an international database of lost and stolen passports when passengers boarded Flight 370, an omission that may have allowed two Iranian men with stolen passports onto the plane. Malaysian Home Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told the Malay Mail Online this week that using Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database might have slowed down the process of immigration checks at airport counters. He said the country's immigration's equipment could not handle the global database of 40.2 million lost passports. Interpol fired back on Friday, saying the problem cannot be blamed on technology or Interpol. ""Interpol's SLTD database takes just seconds to reveal whether a passport is listed, with recent tests providing results in 0.2 seconds,"" the international law enforcement agency said in a statement. ""The fact is that the U.S. consults this database more than 230 million times per year; the UK more than 140 million times; the UAE more than 100 million times and Singapore more than 29 million times. Not one of these countries, or indeed any INTERPOL member country, has ever stated that the response time is too slow."" Interpol earlier said two Iranian men, Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza, 29, used stolen Austrian and Italian passports to board Flight 370.

"(CNN) -- I grew up a poor kid in Detroit. Government cheese sandwiches, occasional nights without electricity, long-distance telephone calls reserved for emergencies only. Yet despite our struggles, my family never lost hope that life would get better for us. We never lost faith in the American dream. And as trivial as it may seem, a lot of that had to do with Red Lobster. Now before you dismiss the notion that a chain restaurant could somehow be a beacon of light, you have to understand that in my neighborhood, if your family went to Red Lobster for dinner, that meant you were really doing something. It meant you got dressed up in your church clothes. It meant you would be using a salad fork and maybe even ordering the fancy dish you saw on TV. It meant twice, sometimes three times a year, a poor family like mine could order a steak in a middle-class restaurant and pretend we were rich. This is why when word recently came out that the chain was in financial trouble, I -- and many people who grew up poor like me -- paused. ""Our industry is in a period of significant change,with relatively low levels of consumer demand in each of the past several years for restaurants generally, and for casual dining in particular,"" said Clarence Otis, the CEO of Darden, the parent company of Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, among others. According to Forbes, Darden reported a 37.6% drop in earnings per share in the first quarter of the current fiscal year compared with a year before. Red Lobster was the biggest culprit. The magazine reports that the restaurant's revenue dropped 4.9% during the second quarter. Darden this month announced plans to separate Red Lobster's 705 locations from the rest of its portfolio with the possibility that it could be sold off. As I've gotten older and a bit more affluent, perhaps even snobbier, I recognize that with the exception of those delicious cheddar biscuits, most of Red Lobster's dishes pretty much taste the same. But statistics suggest that we haven't been going to restaurants like Red Lobster the way we used to, and it's not because our collective palate has changed. It's because we can't afford to eat out anymore. In the four years since the economy began to rebound, the median annual household income fell by 4.4%. But for black households like the one I grew up in, income fell by nearly 11%, more than twice the rate of Latino homes and three times that of whites. Red Lobster remains a favorite spot for black families to dine after church. I imagine it's harder to do with over a 10th of the family's income gone. But it's a mistake to blame the erosion of buying power and the decline of middle-class touchstones like Red Lobster or JCPenney on just the Great Recession. The truth is, the working class has been getting pinched for decades. From November 2012 to November 2013, weekly earnings rose 1.1% while the consumer price index increased 1.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That small uptick may not seem like much until you factor in three years ago, wages increased 1.8%, and the CPI was up 3.5%. And that may not seem like much until you realize that almost every year since 1983, a series of small ticks like those two examples has been widening the gap between between what we earn and what we can buy. Consider the poverty threshold. For a family of four in 1983 it was $10,178. Adjusted for inflation, that should be $23,817.03 today. However, the actual 2013 poverty threshold is $23,492, a difference of $325.03. When you're living check to check, that's a lot of money. When you're living check to check with smaller checks to work with, luxuries quickly fall by the wayside. Luxuries like going out to eat, which has slowed considerably since 2010. Red Lobster is not the only restaurant seeing more empty seats than in years past. It's just the one that happens to have an interesting tie to the poor folks I knew. The poor folks I know. As the nation talks about income inequality and the prospects of raising the minimum wage, it's interesting to note that the true buying power of minimum wage peaked in 1968. That also happens to be the same year Red Lobster was founded. I'm no economist, but I doubt that the struggles of the working class and the struggles of a restaurant that depends on the working class for business are just a coincidence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson grew up poor, and a real treat once or twice a year was to go to Red Lobster .

"(CNN) -- Broken noses, black eyes, bent fingers -- rugby players wear their battle scars as badges of honor. ""You're never in danger of not being seen as a rugby player,"" says England's Simon Shaw, who at 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 meters) tall is never in danger of not being seen. ""Rugby you wear on your face, basically."" After a 15-year international career, Shaw has his fair share of bumps and bruises to take into his third World Cup in New Zealand. Among the marks the game has left on his frame over the years is a classic rugby war wound, one that is increasingly rare in the modern, headgear-wearing era: a cauliflower ear. But his is a minor example compared to some former players. A bluffer's guide to rugby union . England scrum coach and former player Graham Rowntree is naturally blessed with ears like taxi doors, but the former loosehead prop augmented them with years of hard service in front row of the scrum. As one of the ways to restart play, the set scrum is also one area of the game that can be hard to referee -- and what really goes on in there is only really known by the players themselves. But if the battle scars of rugby haven't changed much since Shaw first started playing in 1990, he says that pretty much every other part of the game has been transformed. New Zealand's World Cup obsession . Professionalism, training regimes, nutritionists and physios have all combined to create the modern players' physiques. ""It amuses me that in adverts and in films that get made about rugby, often they're blokes that are overweight and with beer bellies. That's not the case anymore,"" Shaw says. ""Bumps and minor injuries are part and parcel of the game, given the strength and the speed of players playing now. But also guys now are conditioned more to take the hits. ""It can look worse than it is as these days there are something like 15 TV cameras trained on every game. It can even be in 3-D and you can watch it in slow motion."" That's easy for Shaw to say. His enduring toughness has given him the ability to play at the highest level for over 20 years. But for armchair spectators, the hard-hitting part of rugby they find so appealing remains best sampled vicariously. ""I've played with dislocated fingers. You often get (injuries) a couple of days before a game. You just tape them up and get on with it,"" Shaw says. The ultimate example of ""getting on with it"" must be former New Zealand captain Wayne ""Buck"" Shelford. In a match against France in 1986, his scrotum was ripped by an opponent's studded boot. It's a horrific injury that would make most never want to play again, but Shelford went to the sideline, had it stitched up and amazingly went back on the field to play the rest of the match. Shelford has said that he doesn't remember the incident or the game itself, having also been knocked out and losing a few teeth as well. Rules have tightened up against dangerous play to curb stray boots and flying fists. ""The game isn't quite as ferocious nowadays,"" says Shaw. ""Well, basically there are not quite as many fights."" Spear tackling and taking out players who are jumping for the ball are not allowed because of the potentially career or even life-threatening consequences. As well as tighter laws, having so many cameras at big matches has meant that players can't get away with any foul play behind the referee's back. Certainly nothing like the organized brawl that took place on the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa in 1974 that has become a rugby legend. After some violent play in previous matches, Lions captain Willie John McBride decided before the match in Port Elizabeth that his team would ""get their retaliation in first"" at the first sign of South African aggression. When ""99"" was called at a lineout, each one of the 15 Lions players took a swing at an opponent, meaning the referee couldn't identify the instigator of the fight. Not one player was sent off. As he looks forward to what will probably be his last international appearances, Shaw has no nostalgia for the old days. The game remains tough enough without too many of the extras. ""The level of rucking (a contest for the ball after a tackle) has pretty much been eradicated from the game, which has made it a lot safer. You don't come away from a game with a road map on your back made of ruck marks.""","Physical nature of rugby means that bruises and injuries are common .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A series of attacks and gunbattles between Mexican drug cartel suspects and police left at least 14 people dead and 22 wounded Thursday night, officials and news reports said. Nine cartel suspects and three police officers died in two ferocious gunbattles in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo, federal official Jose Alberto Rodriguez Calderon said. Another four police were wounded, the government-run Notimex news agency said. El Excelsior newspaper put that figure at 10 agents wounded. Separately, grenade and heavy-weapon attacks on law enforcement installations in two cities in Guanajuato state killed a civilian and a police agent and wounded 18 others, news reports said. The Hidalgo shootouts started when state police searching for several federal agents reported missing found them alive and safe near an auto racetrack in the Mineral de la Reforma municipality, Rodriguez Calderon was quoted as saying in Notimex. Almost immediately after police found the agents, drug suspects nearby started shooting. A simultaneous shootout occurred in the city of La Calera, also in the Mineral de la Reforma municipality, the news agency said. Police were attacked with hand grenades in that confrontation, leaving two officers dead. A third officer died later in a hospital. The nine drug suspects were killed in La Calera, Rodriguez Calderon said. Each firefight lasted 20 minutes. Officials confiscated 1.2 million pesos (more than $92,000), 3 kilograms of cocaine (6.6 pounds), six AK-47 assault rifles, an Uzi submachine gun, two hand grenades, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, four luxury vehicles, 12 cell phones, 11 bullet-proof vests and seven handcuffs, Rodriguez Calderon said. No arrests were made, and one suspect got away, the federal official said. In Guanajuato state, also in central Mexico, gunmen attacked police stations in the cities of Silao and Irapuato, El Correo newspaper reported. In Silao, at least 20 heavily armed hooded men riding in three dark trucks carried out the attacks, the newspaper said. The attackers first launched three grenades against a police station and then fired with AK-47 and R-15 assault rifles, littering the ground with hundreds of spent shells. That attack killed two people. Ten of the wounded were reported to be gravely injured and were transferred to the nearby city of Léon. The assault also damaged 15 vehicles, five of which caught on fire. Thursday's attacks on police installations resembled assaults last month in a half-dozen cities in Michoacan state. Those attacks were attributed to La Familia Michoacana drug cartel, which was accused of torturing and killing 12 off-duty federal agents around the same time and dumping their bodies on a remote road. Federal police have arrested at least 10 members of La Familia, including some top leaders, since the July 13 killings. The killings and the attacks on police installations were among reprisals by La Familia after the federal police captured one of their top leaders, authorities said. An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. More than 10,000 people have died in that time span, about 1,000 of them police.","Nine drug cartel suspects and three police officers die in gunbattles, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- With land come landslides. While they're inevitable in many ways, people don't inevitably have to die because of them. That line of thinking is being raised following Washington state's disaster in Snohomish County, where at least 17 people died and 49 structures were destroyed after a fast-moving landslide buried a square mile in up to 40 feet of mud. After a smaller landslide struck the same area in 2006, officials invested millions of dollars to reduce the hazards, and residents felt safe, Snohomish County Emergency Management Director John Pennington contended this week. ""We really did a great job of mitigating,"" he told reporters. Officials and many residents have long known they live in landslide country, Pennington said. He cited how a 2010 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan contains a chapter warning about the same land mass that collapsed a week ago. That tract was labeled as one of several potential ""hot spots."" But no one had foreknowledge of Saturday's catastrophe, he asserted. ""Sometimes, big events just happen,"" Pennington explained. Some experts and residents of Oso, Washington, now take sharp exception with Pennington. As rescue teams still seek survivors in the mud almost a week later, the disaster prompts new questions about how the local government allowed homes and a community to remain in the path of a potential landslide -- a peril that was highlighted as recently as 1999 in a Seattle-based geomorphologist's report to the Army Corps of Engineers. Landslides are as endemic to the area as earthquakes are to California, experts say. Last week's landslide occurred on the lush western slopes of the Cascades, where dense forests of 150-foot firs are drenched with 120 inches of rain a year, sprouting a biomass greater than the Amazon rain forests', said Ralph Haugerud of the U.S. Geological Survey's Seattle office. ""This is a valley lined with landslides, going back 14,000 years when the glaciers left,"" Haugerud said. ""And before that there weren't any landslides because it was submerged under 3,000 feet of ice."" Experts and residents now wonder whether more aggressive government action is needed for communities near sliding terrain. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee acknowledged the seriousness of a broader review, but said the state has a more urgent matter -- finding additional survivors or bodies first. After that, authorities can then examine events leading to the landslide and how to safeguard against future ones. ""We will get to the answer,"" Inslee told CNN this week. ""It's going to take some time."" Seattle-based geomorphologist Daniel Miller said he would never have built a house around where the disaster occurred. He co-wrote the 1999 report for the Army Corps of Engineers that looked at options to reduce sediments from landslides in the area. The 56-page study identified ""a very large volume of material that could potentially become unstable,"" he said this week. ""That's the portion that appears to have failed in this event,"" he said. Miller cautioned that his study never assessed risk. At the same time, he said that he believes his study was shelved by officials who could have done more than they did. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Patricia Graesser said the study spoke to how people were living in the landslide area but the report wasn't a risk assessment of landslide hazards. Rather, the study was designed to look at restoring the ecosystem for the nearby North Fork Stillaguamish River's fisheries. ""What we're looking at in those sites is silt entering the river and silt in salmon spawning beds, and could we do something to restore their habitat,"" Graesser said. ""It's documented in there that there was a risk of catastrophic failure and it was documented that people live there. But that wasn't the purpose of the study."" The 1999 study clearly states a 60-year history of landslides in the area, notably in 1937, 1942, 1951, 1952, 1967 and 1988. ""I currently have no basis for estimating the probable rate or timing of future landslide activity,"" Miller's study states. ""The primary conclusion to be drawn is that mass wasting activity will persist for as long as the river remains at the toe of the landslide."" The proposed restoration project ended with Miller's study because there was no further funding from Congress and Snohomish County, Graesser said. Though a state ordinance asks counties to map landslide hazards, it has not been translated into zoning restrictions, according to Miller. Local officials apprised residents of the perils as public improvements were made after the 2006 landslide, Pennington said. One resident, however, challenged Pennington's contention. ""Nobody ever told us that there were geology reports,"" Robin Youngblood told CNN. ""This is criminal, as far as I'm concerned."" While authorities might have done more -- like making sure that all landowners knew about the risk -- that doesn't absolve residents who built houses there, Miller said. ""As landowners, we have some responsibility to be aware of our surroundings and their risks,"" Miller added. While there were indications that a ""very large"" landslide was possible, no one knew how it might happen or how devastating it might be. ""Ultimately, there was no way to know when a landslide would occur,"" Miller said. For Miller, the risk was too high. He found it incredulous to see new buildings go up after the 2006 landslide. ""My reaction was to shake my head and say, 'This is nuts,'"" Miller said. Among the attractions for residents is recreational fishing on the nearby river, prized for its trout and salmon, said Haugerud, the research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Housing is also relatively cheap, with the bonus of being in a beautiful mountain valley, he said. Reinforcing the local recreational interests are U.S. treaties with local Native American tribes dating back to the 1800s that ensure adequate fisheries in the river, Haugerud said. The river is often full of anglers in chest waders. ""Fishing is a big deal here in Washington,"" Haugerud said. It's also a place where residents don't take kindly to government intrusions, he added. ""This is a corner of the world where the majority of the people are very happy not to have much government regulations,"" Haugerud said. ""Yet it's also where we like to have the government tell us that we're safe."" Laser technology by low-flying aircraft now allows geologists like Haugerud to get a better picture of the topography underneath the dense Cascade forests, he said. But much of that high-definition topography is unstudied, he said. ""We haven't been able to catch up to the data because we have a whole lot more information than we have geologists or that we have funding for geologists,"" Haugerud said. Speaking as a Washington state resident -- and not as government geologist -- Haugerud said reforms may be needed to ensure local officials impose stricter regulations in landslide zones. That may mean local governments have to relocate swaths of residences, he said. ""We have home and communities in places where probably there shouldn't be homes and communities. How do you tell people to move?"" Haugerud asked. Those decisions, he said, ""will be heartbreaking"" and ""won't be easy.""

"New York (CNN) -- The father of the convicted would-be suicide bomber who planned to detonate explosives in New York City subways was sentenced Friday to four and half years in prison on charges that he obstructed a terrorism investigation and intentionally misled authorities. A federal judge handed Mohammed Wali Zazi, the father of Najibullah Zazi, four years for obstruction of justice and six months on charges of visa fraud, prosecutors said. He had faced the prospect of up to 40 years behind bars. The elder Zazi was found guilty in July of destroying bomb-making materials and conspiring to obstruct the federal investigation into his son's and co-conspirators' planned attack on the city's subway system. Zazi's then-attorney, Justine Harris, had argued that his client was unaware that his son was planning to blow up subway stations with bombs planted in backpacks. Najibullah Zazi pleaded guilty to planning the attacks in February 2010. But prosecutor Andrew Goldsmith said the elder Zazi knew exactly what he was doing as he misled investigators. The assistant U.S. attorney told jurors that the father tried to cover up his son's tracks by destroying valuable evidence, lying to FBI agents about people he knew and tipping off other suspects. ""(Zazi) is not charged with being a terrorist,"" Goldsmith said. ""But he lied, and that is a crime."" A relative, identified as Amanullah Zazi, has admitted to helping Najibullah get terror training in northwest Pakistan's Waziristan region, part of a volatile tribal area on the Afghan border. He pleaded guilty to related charges and cooperated with the government. He also testified in Mohammed Wali Zazi's trial that the elder Zazi told him FBI agents were looking for him and three other men and told him to destroy chemicals that might be part of any investigation. Najibullah Zazi told authorities that while at the terrorist training camp, he ""had discussions with al Qaeda about targets including the New York City subway system."" Those attacks were planned for September 2009, prosecutors said.","NEW: Mohammed Wali Zazi is sentenced to 4.5 years in prison .

"(CNN) -- In ""The Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism, and the Reality of the Biological Clock,"" I explore many Big Lies, one of which is that women can delay motherhood until we're ready and if we're not able to get pregnant naturally, then science will make it happen for us. Another Big Lie I write about is that we don't need feminism anymore. In a way, these are two sides of the same lie. In the book, I make a strong argument for why we need feminism more than ever. The language of the biological clock has been around for decades, but conflicting or misleading messages persist. I believe it is the very role of feminists to arm women with knowledge so that they can make better choices to take control of their future. Some people claim that no one is unaware of the impact of age on fertility. They're wrong. A Fertility Centers of Illinois public survey in 2012 showed that only 18.2% of respondents accurately guessed how many couples are affected by fertility problems, and 28.1% didn't know that fertility declines rapidly in women after age 35. In addition, 68.4% of survey respondents weren't aware that as part of a couple, both men and women are equally likely to be infertile. We should be getting this knowledge from our health educators and doctors, and we should be getting it earlier, possibly during sex education. 'The Big Lie' in putting off pregnancy . Headlines continue to distort the reality. Just last week, Jezebel ran a piece with the title, ""New study suggests biological-clock frenzy is bulls--t."" Among the actual findings of the study, by the National Center for Health Statistics, is that while the use of infertility services had declined between 2006 and 2010, white women with higher education levels and household income were the ones more likely to use such services. As sociology professor Arthur Greil, whom I also interviewed for my book, said to HealthDay, ""Women, and especially middle-class white women, are delaying having a first child even longer than before. Part of that reason may be because they have confidence that infertility treatments, when they need them, will work. For a lot of them, it's a false confidence because the treatments work better when you're young."" I started writing ""The Big Lie"" after my third miscarriage in 2011; my first was three years earlier, when I was 37. Since my book came out, I've seen comments along the lines of, ""Just because she failed doesn't mean others will. I have a friend who had two kids naturally in her 40s."" And maybe they will succeed, but they should know that they will be pushing back against tougher and tougher odds. As it happens, my doctors were clear that the biggest factor was my age. The pathologies from my first two miscarriages showed chromosomal abnormalities (by age 40, half our eggs are chromosomally abnormal; by age 42, that figure is 90%); the third was a blighted ovum -- which happens when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus but the embryo doesn't develop. I believe we are at a critical juncture where women of my generation are hitting our 40s and realizing that while many of us don't have children by choice, many of us don't have them because we waited too long. U.S. women having fewer children . We have been a guinea-pig generation when it comes to delaying fertility. According to a Pew study that was conducted in 2008, nearly one in five American women had ended her childbearing years without having a child, compared with one in 10 in the 1970s. Of course, there are many paths to parenthood and one of the objectives of my book is to encourage people to pursue those options (surrogacy, egg donation and freezing, single parenthood, etc.). Also, adoption: there are more than 100,000 children waiting to be adopted in the United States alone. In 2012, there were about 400,000 children in foster care. However, many of the options are costly, and we cannot separate conversations about the pursuit of parenthood from the economics of it. According to a 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it costs about $235,000 to raise a child for the first 17 years. When you factor in fertility treatments or adoption costs, etc., many people simply can't afford to have children. I believe we have to make parenthood a more attainable goal by incorporating more fundamental fertility awareness in sex education and by providing more support through guaranteed parental leave, widespread insurance coverage for fertility treatments, subsidized childcare, etc. I intended my book to be a conversation-starter and policy-changer. I explore how various factors, including feminism's early victories and advances in reproductive science, dovetailed to create an atmosphere in which women believed their timetables for motherhood were more within their controls. Ultimately, though, ""The Big Lie"" is a feminist book, intended to get women to push past the rhetoric and to arm themselves with information. Five questions on egg freezing . One point of feminism, after all, has always been to push back against the sort of magical thinking that tells a woman that someone will be there to come to the rescue, whether a husband or a fertility doctor. That mind-set holds us back from solutions; we have to balance the heartbreaking scenarios with the optimistic ones. Feminism provides a framework within which to argue for solutions to many of the issues that cut across geographic and economic lines. When I started telling my story, I was shocked to discover how many others had stories to tell, too -- if not about themselves, it was about a friend, mother, daughter, etc. A 2009 survey of infertility patients by pharmaceutical giant Schering-Plough revealed that 61% hide the struggle to get pregnant from friends and family. I am hopeful that my book will encourage others to normalize the discourse. I've received dozens of e-mails and read many more comments by those for whom some aspect of my story rings true. I am certainly not the only woman to have multiple miscarriages. I'm not the only woman whose marriage was a casualty of the process. And I'm not the only woman to feel like maybe I waited too long to try to have a biological child. Nor am I the first to write about all these. There are excellent books by Peggy Orenstein, Amy Richards, Miriam Zoll and more. I've been inspired by those who turn adversity into action. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her memoir, ""My Beloved World,"" ""There are uses to adversity, and they don't reveal themselves until tested ... Difficulty can tap unsuspected strengths."" In my case, I took what I learned from my mistakes and from my experience with delayed motherhood and used it as a starting point to interview dozens of women of various ages, sociologists, adoption counselors, and fertility doctors about their opinions. The result is a book that I hope will help others. I explore the choices that women have to make during the course of their lives -- including the choice to have children or not. Women and men need to share their stories, educate themselves, strategize for their goals, advocate for a better future -- and not to be afraid of feminism. Women don't need any more Big Lies.

"(CNN) -- The pastor of a Florida church says his congregation has decided to call off the burning of the Quran that was to be held Saturday -- the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States by the al Qaeda terror network. ""We will definitely not burn the Quran,"" the Rev. Terry Jones told NBC's ""Today"" on Saturday ""Not today, not ever."" The burning had been planned for 6 p.m. Jones arrived in New York late Friday night and was working to set up a meeting with the imam in charge of the Islamic center planned near ground zero. The planned meeting, Jones had said, helped persuade him to halt the burning. Earlier Friday, Jones gave mixed messages about whether he intends to carry out his plans, which have sparked international controversy and protests in the Muslim world. U.S. military leaders said the event would imperil the lives of troops abroad. President Obama said Friday that the idea that ""we would burn the sacred texts of someone else's religion is contrary to what this country stands for."" He said he hopes Jones ""prays on it"" and refrains from doing it. The government has to send a ""very clear message"" that burning the Quran would endanger U.S. troops and serve as a major recruiting tool for al Qaeda, Obama added. On Saturday, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said police met with Jones and plan to keep a ""close tab on him"" for his own safety. ""His safety could be an issue, and we emphasized that to him last evening. And, he seemed to agree. You know. We would like to make certain that he remains safe while he's in this city.""","Jones arrived in New York on Friday night .

"(CNN) -- Stephan Mace of the Army's 61st Cavalry Regiment knew the Taliban would be waiting for him when he returned to eastern Afghanistan in September. Stephan Mace, second from left, with his brothers and father. During a two-week leave in early September, the 21-year-old specialist sat on his father's couch in Winchester, Virginia, and discussed his concerns over Forward Operating Base Keating in Kamdesh District, a region known as a Taliban stronghold. ""He talked about the village next to the base, that it had 300 Taliban, and they couldn't do anything about it because they were in mosques hiding or with other civilians,"" says his father, Larry Mace. ""They knew they were there and they couldn't do anything about it and they killed them."" Mace was one of eight American soldiers killed in a 12-hour standoff on Saturday. That was the most Americans killed by hostile action in Afghanistan in a single day since last July, when nine soldiers died in Wanat, just 20 miles away.  See where soldiers were killed » . Some military analysts say the attacks underscore how outnumbered troops are in that region. The United States believes that about 200 insurgents had been planning Saturday's attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains, sources have told CNN. ""What were the lessons learned?"" Peter Bergen, a CNN terrorism analyst, said Saturday's attack shows the extent to which lessons from last year's attack have been implemented. ""It is supposed to be a lessons-learned exercise,"" Bergen said. ""And then, exactly 20 miles away from the event about a year ago, exactly the same kind of attack happened."" In the Wanat fight, 49 U.S. troops were attacked by nearly 200 Taliban fighters, and the base was later abandoned. ""So, you have to ask yourself, what were the lessons learned? Or were the lessons not implemented? And these remote combat outposts, you know, are obviously sitting ducks,"" Bergen said.  See photos from Afghanistan » . Mace was aware of the dangers he faced, but he still felt a duty to return, his father said. ""He wanted to make a difference, he wasn't afraid. He felt it was something he had to do,"" he said. Like many who died with him, Mace was drawn to the service by a sense of duty, be it to country or family. But he didn't see himself in the military forever. An avid athlete and outdoorsman with a passion for exploration, Mace talked about helping a friend operate a tour company in South Africa, where he had spent three summers. The idea started in his hometown of Purcellville, Virginia, where he worked in a vet clinic with a woman who was married to a South African. ""As he always did, Stephan became good friends with this man, and he invited him out there as a guest. He was just a great kid. You met him, and you immediately liked him,"" his father said. ""The guy he befriended would say, 'Africa wasn't big enough to keep Stephan down. He needed the world,' "" he said. As a child, Mace jumped from one sport to the next, competing nationally in Motocross at 9 before deciding to leave it so he could take up basketball, then later, football in high school. ""He excelled in everything he did. He loved to shoot, which is why I think he joined the military, so he could make a difference doing something he loved,"" his father said. ""I'm sure that's how he died."" Devotion to duty, devotion to family . Others who died alongside Mace on Saturday joined the Army so they could support their families. Staff Sgt. Vernon Martin was devoted to his wife and three children, his mother-in-law said. When he was in the United States, Staff Sgt. Vernon W. Martin of Savannah, Georgia, devoted nearly all his time to his three children, his mother-in-law said. ""He always put them kids before my daughter, a hard-working man who did what he could to provide for those babies. He did what it took to make ends meet,"" Sonja Manior said. Martin and his three children ""pretty much lived"" in Chuck E. Cheese, their favorite place to play and spend time together, Manior said. ""He loved playing around with his kids and seeing them smile. He had a beautiful smile. I loved that smile, my grandson got that smile about him,"" Manior said. Originally from New York, Martin's family moved to Savannah when he was a child. He married his high school sweetheart, Brittany, and enlisted after the couple had their first child. The family lived near the Army base in Fort Carson, Colorado, for a few years, and they planned on moving back to Savannah permanently after Martin returned home next year. Martin, 25, called home frequently, making his last call the night before he was killed. ""They always got their 15 minutes in to talk about what the kids was doing, what they were doing. He was supposed to call the next day before his son's soccer game,"" Manior recalled. ""But he never called. We thought he must be working or something. Never thought something like this would have happened,"" she said. ""The harsh reality of kids going into the military"" The small community in Michigan's Upper Peninsula where Specialist Christopher T. Griffin is from is still reeling from the news of his death, his high school principal said. ""You see on [the] news all the time that people [in the military] lose their lives, but in a school our size, you never think it could be one of yours,"" said Mark Pavloski, principal of Rudyard High School, where Griffin graduated from in 2004. Christopher Griffin's hometown is still shocked by the news of his death, his former high school principal says. ""You see it as an opportunity to find a career or go into college. But that's the harsh reality of kids going into the military, that this could happen."" Griffin, 24, of Kincheloe, attended Rudyard High for his freshman, junior and senior years, the principal said. People who knew Griffin in high school said he spoke of going into the military, but he never made a show of it, Pavloski said. ""He was a very hard-working young man, very conscientious, very unassuming. He wasn't one of those kids who needed to be the center of attention, but he wanted to be successful and he wanted to be in the military."" He had a competitive streak that showed through in turns on the junior varsity football team and varsity wrestling team, the principal said. ""He worked extremely hard in weight room to be successful,"" he said. ""He was quiet and very soft-spoken, but attentive. He wanted to succeed."" Remembering other soldiers . A math teacher who knew Sgt. Michael P. Scusa, 22, of Villas, New Jersey, also described him as an unassuming young man who knew he wanted to join the military. ""He had a buddy, and they always talked about going into the service. He was very passionate about it,"" said Valerie Davis, who taught Scusa 11th- and 12th-grade math at Lower Cape May Regional High School. ""He was a quiet kid in [the] classroom, but he didn't follow the other students. He did what he felt was the right thing."" Scusa lived in Fort Carson with his wife and 1-year-old son, Connor Allen, whom he had named after another fallen soldier, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Other soldiers who died in Saturday's firefight were remembered for their zeal for life. The girlfriend of Pfc. Kevin Thomson of Reno, Nevada, described him as a lively person who was friends with everyone, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette. ""Everyone loved him,"" Jessica Seltzer said of Thomson, 22. ""He could make anyone smile, no matter how bad their day was."" Relatives described Sgt. Joshua M. Hardt, 24, of Applegate, California, as an outgoing athlete who followed his older brother into the Army, his former stepfather told the Gazette. ""He was a typical, all-around good kid,"" James Bell Sr. said of Hardt, who lived at Fort Carson with his wife, according to the Gazette. The family of Sgt. Justin T. Gallegos, 27, learned he had already received two Purple Hearts for being wounded only after his death Saturday, a family friend told news station KVOA. ""He was an unsung hero. He was not the type of a man who touted his accolades. That's Justin,"" Bessie Guadiana-Hoffman told KVOA. The father of a 5-year-old son, Gallegos was on his third deployment to the Middle East after two tours in Iraq, Guadiana-Hoffman told KVOA. ""He would get really upset when people would put down the United States for being at war. He said we don't choose to be at war. We choose to help end the war. Unfortunately the war ended his life,"" she said. Sgt. Joshua J. Kirk, 30, of South Portland, Maine, left behind a wife and 2-year-old daughter, according to CNN affiliates. His wife declined to comment when reached by phone Tuesday night. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Stephan Mace told his father he knew the Taliban were near his base .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military killed at least 55 militants over the past 24 hours as part of its week-long crackdown on Taliban militants, an army spokesman said Friday. Pakistani security personnel patrol the troubled Buner district. This week's military operation resulted in more than 230 militant casualties since Sunday, while the military suffered two deaths and eight injuries, according to spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. He has said he hopes the operation will be completed by the end of the week. The operation is part of the Pakistani army's intensified drive against the Taliban in its restive tribal regions. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, Afghan and coalition forces in southern Afghanistan killed 15 militants and wounded 12 others, the U.S. military reported. The incident, which took place early Friday morning in the Arghandab District of Zabul province, occurred after a military convoy was attacked. ""The patrol was en route to a local village to talk with elders about security issues in the area when they were attacked by several armed militants with small-arms fire from a compound. The combined force returned fire killing one militant,"" the military said in a statement. As Afghan security forces secured and searched that and other compounds to make sure there ""were no non-combatants in danger,"" militants shot at troops and the soldiers fired backed. The Afghan and coalition forces pursued the militants into a ""nearby cave complex"" where 14 militants were killed and 12 were wounded. Another militant was detained.","Pakistan military says at least 55 Taliban militants killed in last 24 hours .

"(CNN) -- A journalist was among three people killed Friday during clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and Egyptian security forces in eastern Cairo, Egypt's Interior Ministry said. Mayada Ashraf was fatally shot, according to her employer, the private Egyptian newspaper Al-Dustour. She was covering the fighting when she was killed, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. The clashes involved people who were protesting this week's decision by Egyptian army chief Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to resign from the military and run for president, semiofficial news outlet Ahram Online reported. The demonstrators were supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy, a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ahram Online said. Ashraf was in her 20s and graduated from college last year, according to Al-Dustour. Definitive information on who shot her wasn't immediately available. A representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists called on the Egyptian government Friday to open an independent and impartial investigation into Ashraf's death. The organization noted that opposing groups -- those supporting the army, and those supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood -- were blaming each other for the killing. ""A journalist's death should not be used to settle political scores -- the focus should be on journalists' right to safely cover events in Egypt,"" said Sherif Mansour, the CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. Protests similar to that in eastern Cairo happened across the country on Friday, Ahram Online reported. El-Sisi's decision is just one of the latest grievances expressed by Morsy supporters. El-Sisi deposed Morsy last year following mass protests against Morsy's rule. Morsy became Egypt's first freely elected leader in 2012, a year after a popular uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule. El-Sisi is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power a year into his term -- seeing him as the kind of strong man needed to end the turmoil dogging Egypt since Mubarak's 2011 ouster. But El-Sisi is reviled by the Islamist opposition, which sees him as the mastermind of a coup against an elected leader and the author of a fierce crackdown on dissent. Egypt has suffered bloody internal strife since Morsy was overthrown. On Wednesday, police clashed with protesters at Cairo University who were demonstrating against a court's decision to sentence 529 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood to death. In a separate report, Al-Ahram quoted the health ministry as saying one person was killed and eight injured in the clashes. Monday's court ruling drew widespread criticism from international human rights groups.","Mayada Ashraf was killed while covering clashes, state-run news outlet reports .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Three roadside bombs exploded Friday in quick succession at an outdoor pet market in Baghdad, killing five people and wounding 31 others, police officials said. The bombings took place at a market where young men buy and sell pigeons in Husseiniya, a poor Shiite neighborhood in southeastern Baghdad. This type of market, popular in less affluent neighborhoods, tends to be very busy on Fridays. In February 2008, 99 people were killed by bomb attacks at two other pet markets in Baghdad. Daily violence has dropped drastically across Iraq since 2008, but sporadic attacks continue. A series of bomb and gun attacks have taken place in different Iraqi cities this week, including a blast in a popular restaurant in southeastern Baghdad on Thursday evening that killed three people and wounded 10 others. In April, 126 people were killed in attacks across the country and 271 people were wounded. That was higher than in March, which had the lowest monthly death toll for Iraqis since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, when only 112 people were killed.","The bombings strike a market where young men buy and sell pigeons .

"Washington (CNN) -- Not everyone subscribes to a New Year's resolution, but Americans will be required to follow new laws in 2014. Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois and transgender protections in California. Although many new laws are controversial, they made it through legislatures, public referendum or city councils and represent the shifting composition of American beliefs. Federal: Health care, of course, and vending machines . The biggest and most politically charged change comes at the federal level with the imposition of a new fee for those adults without health insurance. For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine. The Obamacare, or Affordable Care Act, mandate also requires that insurers cover immunizations and some preventive care. Additionally, millions of poor Americans will receive Medicaid benefits starting January 1. Thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines. Local: Guns, family leave and shark fins . Connecticut: While no national legislation was approved to tighten gun laws a year after the Newtown school shooting, Connecticut is implementing a final round of changes to its books: All assault weapons and large capacity magazines must be registered. Oregon: Family leave in Oregon has been expanded to allow eligible employees two weeks of paid leave to handle the death of a family member. California: Homeless youth are eligible to receive food stamps. The previous law had a minimum wage requirement. Delaware: Delaware is the latest in a growing number of states where residents can no longer possess, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine. Illinois and drones . Illinois: passed two laws limiting the use of drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman. The measure passed after the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it would use drones to monitor hunters. PETA said it aims through its ""air angels"" effort to protect against ""cruel"" and ""illegal"" hunting. Also in Illinois, another law prohibits the use of drones for law enforcement without a warrant. Gender and voting identity . California: Students can use bathrooms and join school athletic teams ""consistent with their gender identity,"" even if it's different than their gender at birth. Arkansas: The state becomes the latest state requiring voters show a picture ID at the voting booth. Minimum wage and former felon employment . Workers in 13 states and four cities will see increases to the minimum wage. While most amount to less than 15 cents per hour, workers in places like New Jersey and Connecticut will see a slightly larger increase. New Jersey residents voted to raise the state's minimum wage by $1 to $8.25 per hour. And in Connecticut, lawmakers voted to raise it between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70. The wage would go up to $8 in Rhode Island and New York. California is also raising its minimum wage to $9 per hour, but workers must wait until July to see the addition. Rhode Island: It is the latest state to prohibit employers from requiring job applicants to signify if they have a criminal record on a job application. Social media and pot . Oregon: Employers and schools can't require a job or student applicant to provide passwords to social media accounts. Colorado: Marijuana becomes legal in the state for buyers over 21 at a licensed retail dispensary. (Sourcing: much of this list was obtained from the National Conference of State Legislatures).

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A suspected drug cartel lieutenant was in charge of a plot to kill Mexican President Felipe Calderon, Mexican government officials said. Dimas Diaz Ramos, known as ""El Dimas,"" is presented Monday at federal police headquarters in Mexico City. Dimas Diaz Ramos, known as ""El Dimas,"" also is accused of being a top drug exporter to the United States, hiding the contraband in the tires of trucks taking produce across the border. Diaz was one of five suspects arrested Sunday and publicly paraded before reporters Monday. The men belong to the Cartel del Pacifico, also known as the Sinaloa cartel, said Eduardo Ramon Pequeño, the Mexican federal police anti-drug chief. ""The federal police began its investigation because of a threat made against the president of the republic, as a result of the declared war against organized crime and after a series of arrests and seizure of large amounts of cash belonging to the 'El Mayo' Zambada organization last year by the army and federal police,"" Pequeño said at Monday's news conference. ""Through intelligence reports by the federal government, it became known that the threat was made by the Cartel del Pacifico, and Dimas Diaz had been tasked with coming up with the details for a possible attempt."" Mexican officials did not release details of the alleged plot. Speaking in Guadalajara after a meeting with President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Calderon downplayed any possible attempt on his life. ""It would not be the first nor the last time that there is talk about some assassination attempt on my life,"" Calderon told reporters. Diaz and the four other suspects were arrested in the city of Culiacan in Sinaloa state, officials said.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- At least three people were killed and five others injured in a car bomb blast near Yemen's Oil Ministry, government officials said Sunday. The explosions happened near the rear entrance of the ministry, which is located in the capital, Sanaa, where security has been tightened in the last few weeks. An Oil Ministry official told CNN the bomb is believed to have been planted under a car belonging to an officer. ""Security is very tight in the area and we believe those behind the attack were hoping the vehicle would be allowed to enter the ministry compound and explode inside,"" the official told CNN. ""Security is always tight at the ministry, but if the vehicle had exploded inside the compound, there would have been dozens of deaths,"" said Sanaa resident Bakri al-Areqi, who lives near the ministry. Yemen's defense and interior ministry officials confirmed the blast had occurred. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack. Strict checkpoints have been put up on roads leading to the oil and defense ministries. Two soldiers were killed and 14 others were injured Tuesday when a bomb planted under a military bus exploded in Sanaa, authorities said. The soldiers were on their way to work from another district of the capital. Violence continues on a daily basis in Sanaa, with thousands of troops still stationed on the streets. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network.

"(CNN) -- R. Sargent Shriver, who was responsible for launching the U.S. Peace Corps after marrying into the Kennedy family and joining John F. Kennedy's White House, has died, according to his family. Shriver, whose full name was Robert Sargent Shriver Jr., was 95. He had suffered for years from Alzheimer's disease. The family released a statement, saying Shriver died Tuesday ""surrounded by his five children, five children in-law, and his 19 grandchildren."" ""He lived to make the world a more joyful, faithful, and compassionate place,"" the family's statement said. ""He worked on stages both large and small but in the end, he will be best known for his love of others. No one ever came into his presence without feeling his passion and his enthusiasm for them."" President Barack Obama said he was ""deeply saddened"" over the death of Shriver, whom he called ""one of the brightest lights of the greatest generation."" ""Of his many enduring contributions, he will perhaps best be remembered as the founding director of the Peace Corps, helping make it possible for generations of Americans to serve as ambassadors of goodwill abroad,"" Obama said. ""His loss will be felt in all of the communities around the world that have been touched by Peace Corps volunteers over the past half century and all of the lives that have been made better by his efforts to address inequality and injustice here at home."" After overseeing the Peace Corps launch in the early 1960s, Shriver went on to serve subsequent presidential administrations and kept up his activism throughout his life, becoming a chief architect of President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty and later heading the Special Olympics, which was founded by his wife, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Shriver's entree into the Kennedy family was Joseph P. Kennedy, the family patriarch, who hired him to run a business venture in Chicago. According to the Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, the work led to an introduction to Eunice Kennedy, whose siblings included JFK, Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy. Shriver and Eunice Kennedy married in 1953. Shriver served as JFK's Midwest campaign manager for his 1960 presidential bid before heading the Peace Corps' launch, which was seen as part of a new approach to the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. ""He told me that everyone in Washington seemed to think that the Peace Corps was going to be the biggest fiasco in history,"" Shriver told Time magazine in 1963 of Kennedy's request that he head the program, ""and it would be much easier to fire a relative than a friend."" In 2011, the Peace Corps is celebrating its 50th anniversary. More than 200,000 volunteers have served in 139 counties on issues ranging from education to public health to environmental preservation through the program, according to the Peace Corps' website. The Peace Corps Tuesday mourned the loss ""of our founder, friend and guiding light."" The Special Olympics, in a statement, said Shriver was an ""advocate for the poor and powerless, and he compiled an unparalleled record of public service at every tier, from the local level to the world community."" After John F. Kennedy, his brother-in-law, was assassinated in 1963, Shriver was tapped by Johnson to launch the White House Office of Economic Opportunity, which comprised a handful of anti-poverty programs. In a series of maneuvers that spoke to Shriver's penchant for working across the political aisle, he served as Republican President Richard Nixon's ambassador to France before becoming Democrat George McGovern's running mate in 1972, as the two unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nixon. McGovern named Shriver as his running mate after his first choice, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, stepped down after revealing he'd had psychiatric treatment that included electroshock therapy. In the 1980s and 1990s, Shriver served as chairman of the board of Special Olympics International, which Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded in 1968. The organization sponsors sports training and events around the world for people with intellectual disabilities. Shriver, who was born in Westminster, Maryland, in 1915 and who graduated from Yale, also was long active in the Roman Catholic Church. President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994. ""We are greatly saddened by the passing of Sargent Shriver. He leaves behind an astonishing legacy of people helped, lives transformed, and communities improved,"" the former president and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in a statement.  ""Through his work and his passion, he helped build a better America and a more humane world. And he did it with boundless enthusiasm, infectious joy, and the deepest love for his family, his nation, and his work."" Eunice Kennedy Shriver died in 2009. The Shrivers had five children including Maria Shriver, the media personality and former first lady of California; and Timothy P. Shriver, who now heads Special Olympics International. Maria Shriver's husband, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said his father-in-law's life ""is a blueprint for those of us who aspire to place the needs of others above our own.""

"(CNN) -- While his comment about Anne Frank drew criticism from around the world, pop star Justin Bieber and his camp have remained silent on the issue -- and plan to keep it that way. There will be no official statement from Bieber or his representatives, a source close to the star told CNN on Monday. Bieber did not mention it to his millions of followers on Twitter and Facebook. The controversy stems from the 19-year-old's visit to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Friday. In the site's guest book, he wrote, ""Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber."" The tourist site shared the message on its official Facebook page. Adolescent and teen girls obsessed with the Canadian singer are known as ""beliebers."" Anne Frank died a teenager in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945. Thousands of people responded angrily to what Bieber wrote. ""She would've been a WHAT? That little idiot is way too full of himself,"" Kevin Garcia Leon wrote in the most popular comment on the site's Facebook page. On CNN.com, the most popular comment read, ""Can anyone be more self-obsessed?"" Rabbi defends Bieber . An expert on Anne Frank came to Bieber's defense Monday. Had Frank been born 70 years later, she would have likely been a ""belieber,"" said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Weisenthal Center in Los Angeles. ""There's nothing insulting about that,"" Rabbi Hier told CNN. ""She was very modern and she could very likely be his fan and on Twitter."" Hier has studied Frank's life and journal closely in preparation for the creation of a permanent exhibit at his center's Museum of Tolerance in Beverly Hills. ""Anne Frank was a very modern girl,"" he said. ""In the room, she had pictures of Hollywood stars. She was infatuated with Hollywood."" Anne Frank hid with her family in the ""secret annex"" of an Amsterdam house for two years before she was captured by Nazis in 1944. She died a teenager in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945. The site, a popular tourist attraction among visitors to Amsterdam, expressed no complaints about Bieber. ""The Anne Frank House was pleased to welcome Justin Bieber to the Anne Frank House last Friday,"" an official Facebook post said Monday. ""We think it is very positive that he took the time and effort to visit our museum. He was very interested in the story of Anne Frank and stayed for over an hour. We hope that his visit will inspire his fans to learn more about her life and hopefully read the diary."" The comments under the statement suggested it did little to calm those who were infuriated. Few questioned whether Anne Frank would have been a Bieber fan, were she a teenager today. The complaints focused on why Bieber thought about himself at all after being exposed to the seriousness of Anne Frank's experience and the Holocaust. ""Pity the guy, after making the effort to visit, wasn't grown up enough to have a break from being so self centered and make a comment like that,"" Steve Landles wrote in the most popular comment on that Facebook post. A 'chill day' Bieber, who is in the middle of a European tour, stopped by the Anne Frank House between his concert in Antwerp, Belgium, and a Saturday performance in Arnhem, Netherlands. He told fans on Twitter it was a ""chill day."" He visited the house ""together with his friends and guards"" Friday night, according to the site's official Facebook page, adding that fans ""were waiting outside to see a glimpse of him."" The Anne Frank House confirmed to CNN that its Facebook post carrying Bieber's message was authentic. While the vast majority of the comments online slammed the pop star, some people expressed support for him. Heather Mirman cited a line from Anne Frank's diary: ""Despite everything, I believe people are really good at heart."" ""I think before everyone goes bashing Justin Bieber we should take a moment to think about these words and why Anne said them,"" she wrote. "" ... He is trying to say that he would've been proud to (have) had her as a fan because of her courage and the fact that she believed in good."" Bieber: From tween sensation to adult icon . Frank was 13 when she and her family began hiding in a dark and damp ""secret annex"" of the house to escape the German roundup of Jews in Holland in July 1942.

"(CNN) -- At least six people were killed in bombings across the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, on Thursday, police said. Four car bombs and two roadside devices exploded in five different areas around the city. Almost all of the neighborhoods were largely Shiite. At least 21 other people were wounded, police said. The blasts came one day after deadly attacks across the country that killed 47 people and wounded more than 120 others. Political and sectarian violence has raged in the past year. There has been constant tension between Sunnis and Shiites. Many Sunnis in Iraq have felt marginalized by the largely Shiite government. The Shiites have emerged politically in the country since Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. It isn't yet known who is responsible for the Thursday violence. Anbar, other regions hit badly . The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. The figures remained grim in January. According to the U.N. mission in Iraq, more than 600 civilians and more than 100 members of the country's security forces have been killed. The U.N. tally does not include those killed in a fresh wave of violence in Iraq's Anbar province, west of Baghdad, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraqi security forces have been fighting since the end of last year. U.N.officials estimate that as many as 45,000 families have been displaced in Anbar. ""The U.N. continues to provide aid to those affected by the fighting in Anbar, despite the challenges posed by the deteriorating security environment and ongoing operations in the province,"" said Nickolay Mladenov, U.N. point man in Iraq. The ongoing violence in the Sunni provinces of Anbar, Salaheddin and Nineveh has raised concerns among some observers that parliamentary elections scheduled for April 30 will be delayed. ""The U.N. continues to hold discussions with senior political figures in an attempt to assist in paving the ground for a political solution to the crisis, calling on all to show national unity and address the root causes of violence in Iraq,"" Mladenov said. Human Rights Watch, the human rights watchdog group, issued a report Thursday on the detention of thousands of Iraqi women subject to torture and ""ill-treatment, including the threat of sexual abuse."" The group cited the country's ""weak judiciary"" and substandard trial proceedings as causes of the problem.","Shiite neighborhoods affected by violence .

"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (CNN)  -- After flying through the night for seven hours aboard Air Force One, nobody would blame President Obama for being at least slightly groggy when he arrived in Copenhagen, Denmark, for a quick four hours to make the final pitch for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics. Michelle Obama's speech in Copenhagen focused on her roots in Chicago and her father's battle with MS. Maybe that explains why the president seemed to snag the silver medal while first lady Michelle Obama, who's been in Copenhagen a couple of days, clearly took the gold with an emotional speech focused on her family's roots in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, and her late father's battle with multiple sclerosis. ""Sports were a gift I shared with my dad, especially the Olympic Games,"" Obama said in her portion of the U.S. delegation's final presentation to the International Olympic Committee. ""Some of my best memories are sitting on my dad's lap, cheering on Olga and Nadia, Carl Lewis and others for their brilliance and perfection. ""But I never dreamed that the Olympic flame might one day light up lives in my neighborhood,"" she said. ""But today, I can dream, and I am dreaming of an Olympic and Paralympic Games in Chicago that will light up lives in neighborhoods all across America and all across the world."" The mention of the Paralympic Games was significant because a good bit of Obama's speech tugged at the heartstrings by focusing on how her father was diagnosed with MS in his early 30s, leaving him nearly unable to walk. She spoke in a halting voice about how he kept getting sicker but still taught her how to play sports while propping himself up on crutches. ""My dad was my hero. And when I think of what these games could mean to people all over the world, I think of people like my dad, who face seemingly insurmountable challenges, but they never give up."" Watch as the president and Mrs. Obama speak in Copenhagen » . IOC members will be voting Friday; results will be announced after 12:30 p.m. ET. ""I think Chicago could not have made a better presentation. Now it's up to the IOC,"" President Obama said. ""Only thing I'm upset about is I followed Michelle, which is never good."" Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley also did some lobbying. ""We want to share our city with the world,"" Daley told IOC members. ""You have my commitment that Chicago will work every day for the next seven years to be an Olympic city that you and the world will be proud of."" The president gave the final word, saying that after moving around the world as a child, he finally settled in Chicago. ""I came to discover that Chicago is that most American of American cities, but one where citizens from more than 130 nations inhabit a rich tapestry of distinctive neighborhoods,"" Obama said. ""Nearly one year ago, on a clear November night, people from every corner of the world gathered in the city of Chicago or in front of their televisions to watch the results of the U.S. presidential election,"" he told IOC members. ""Their interest wasn't about me as an individual. Rather, it was rooted in the belief that America's experiment in democracy still speaks to a set of universal aspirations and ideals. ""There is nothing I would like more than to step just a few blocks from my family's home and with Michelle and our two girls welcome the world back to our neighborhood. At the beginning of this new century, the nation that has been shaped by people from around the world wants a chance to inspire it once more.""","Obamas in Copenhagen making a pitch to bring 2016 Olympics to Chicago .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police Tuesday arrested a Spanish soldier and his Russian girlfriend for allegedly posting videos on the Internet promoting Islamic extremist views and calling for attacks in Spain, a Ministry of Interior statement said. Spanish police released these images of Christian Peso Ruiz Coello, left, and Maria Choubina. The suspects, both 23 years old and practicing Muslims, were arrested in the southern Spanish city of Granada. They were identified as Christian Peso Ruiz Coello, born in Granada, and Maria Choubina, born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1985. The investigation began last June when police detected videos on the Internet that called for Islamic attacks in Spain, and specifically in Granada, the last outpost of the Muslim Moors in medieval Spain, with its fabled Alhambra palace that still stands. The suspects posted 11 radical videos seen 2,007 times on the Internet and had online contact with 200 people in Europe and the Middle East who were favorable to a so-called ""international jihad,"" the ministry said. Their videos allegedly aimed to inspire Islamic extremists to carry out attacks, using messages such as a call to liberate ""Al Andalus,"" the vast portion of Spain under Muslim rule for centuries during the Middle Ages until the Catholic monarchs conquered the last bastion of Granada, in 1492. The videos also allegedly portrayed offenses against Muslims who live in modern Spain, including many in Granada. ""This activity aimed to increase the threat in our country by terrorist groups and elements linked to the 'global jihad,'"" the ministry statement said. Police searched the homes of the suspects, in the operation supervised by Spain's anti-terrorism National Court in Madrid.","Spanish soldier, Russian girlfriend held for allegedly promoting Islamic extremism .

"(CNN) -- There were words said between two men at a movie theater, but nothing that merited the one to fatally shoot the other, the victim's wife said Thursday. Former Tampa police officer Curtis Reeves is in custody, accused of shooting Chad Oulson at the Wesley Chapel, Florida, movie theater on January 13. Chad Oulson's wife, Nicole Oulson, appeared on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Thursday to give her recollections of that day. Oulson was wearing a cast, a result of an injury she suffered in the shooting. Widow: 'My whole world just got shattered' ""The gunshot wound to my finger is the least of my worries right now,"" Oulson told ABC. ""The real pain is in my heart and that will take a long time, if ever, to get over."" Reeves, 71, got into an altercation with Chad Oulson because he was texting the couple's babysitter during the previews for ""Lone Survivor,"" police said. The 6-foot-1, 270-pound Reeves, who was also with his wife for the matinee at the Grove 16 Theatre in suburban Tampa, left the auditorium, apparently to complain to management, police said. Reeves returned ""irritated,"" a witness said. The argument continued and popcorn was thrown. According to the incident report, Reeves told police he was hit with an ""unknown object"" in the face, and then, fearing he was being attacked, pulled a handgun from his pocket and shot Chad Oulson. In aftermath of shooting, heroes responded . ""It was a couple of words. No threats. No harm. No nothing,"" Nicole Oulson said on ABC. ""We're both very respectful when the movie is on, that we put our phones away, so he took a couple of seconds just to check the phone to make sure there were no messages about our daughter."" A defense attorney, who tried and failed to get a judge to grant the Reeves bail, said that the former police officer was the victim and that Chad Oulson was the agressor. Nicole Oulson's attorney, TJ Grimaldi, dismissed that idea. It shouldn't matter what Chad Oulson threw at Reeves, the attorney told CNN.

"(CNN) -- It's your first day at university and you've got 15 minutes to get to room 9-209. Easy, right? What if the campus is a labyrinth of unfamiliar buildings stretching over a whopping 168 acres? Suddenly, finding that room feels a bit like locating a particular grain of sand at the beach. Never fear, SkyCall is here -- a flying robot that guides you to your destination, pointing out important landmarks along the way. It might seem like a scene from a sci-fi film, but at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), these high-tech drones are helping students navigate the maze-like site -- and could soon be escorting the rest of us around difficult environments too. ""MIT campus is quite complex, it has a lot of buildings, and sometimes people do get lost,"" said Carlo Ratti, director of the institute's Senseable City Lab, which created the futuristic device. ""We had a lot of new students on campus, and saw this as a good opportunity to test it,"" he added. ""It's a mere step towards using SkyCall in more complex situations, such as search-and-rescue missions."" Only a SkyCall away . So how does this floating tour guide work? After downloading the SkyCall app to their smartphones, visitors call the robot, which tracks their GPS location and flies to the rescue. They then type the room number into their mobiles, and SkyCall guides them there -- pointing out landmarks using a small speaker. Watch: Flying robots' aerial acrobatics . Cruising at a leisurely 6 kilometers per hour (3.7 mph), the quadropcopter -- featuring four propellers -- has enough battery power to last 15 minutes. In-built sonar sensors ensure SkyCall doesn't crash into obstacles. And should the visitor fall behind at any point, the clever copter will wait for them to catch up -- much like a real-life tour guide. ""People were having a lot of fun with it -- it's kind of like an unusual travel companion,"" said Ratti. ""It can travel 1 mile (1.6 kilometers), but this could easily be a lot more if you have a bigger battery. At the moment it's more of an experimental project."" High-flyer . Indeed, it's hoped that in the future, SkyCall could be developed into everything from city guides for tourists, to rescue robots for survivors of disaster sites. Featuring an in-built camera, the device could relay footage back to others -- particularly useful in rescue missions. Or it may link-up to the user's phone, giving them a bird's eye view of the journey. Watch: Robots inspired by birds . The researchers at MIT's Senseable City Lab are looking at other ways drones could be used in everyday life. ""Drones have had quite bad press because of the military implications,"" explained Ratti. ""But this project this is about helping people. ""We are trying to look at the positive side of drones -- people controlling drones, rather than the skepticism around drones controlling people."" Senseable design? SkyCall is part of a bigger program at Senseable City Lab, exploring how people could use new technology in urban environments. Other projects include robotic bartenders, or devices to measure road rage while driving. ""We have many applications that will help us carry out our everyday tasks,"" said Ratti. ""I think in the case of SkyCall -- and drones in general -- people find it quite intriguing to have a flying companion."" Could SkyCall be our high-tech guardian angel of the future? At the very least, it could make the first day of university a lot less daunting.","Introducing SkyCall, the flying robot turned personal tour guide .

"(CNN) -- Thirty one countries have abolished the death penalty but China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Yemen remain amongst the most frequent executioners, according to a new report from Amnesty International released Monday. The human rights organization officially recorded at least 527 executions in 2010, down from at least 714 in 2009. The leading regions for executions, according to Amnesty, are Asia and the Middle East, with eight of the top 10 nations from those areas. ""While executions may be on the decline, a number of countries continue to pass death sentences for drug-related offenses, economic crimes, sexual relations between consenting adults and blasphemy -- violating international human rights law forbidding the use of the death penalty except for the most serious crimes,"" said Salil Shetty, the group's secretary general. The totals in the Amnesty report exclude China, which carries out the death penalty more than the rest of the world combined. ""China is believed to have executed thousands in 2010 but continues to maintain its secrecy over its use of the death penalty,"" the Amnesty report said. ""China used the death penalty in 2010 against thousands of people for a wide range of crimes that include non-violent offenses and after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards."" Chinese authorities could not immediately be reached for comment. The human rights group flagged China, along with Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Laos, Libya, Malaysia, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, on imposing death sentences for drug-related crimes. Amnesty cited Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates for executing people under the age of 18. The United States carried out the fifth highest number of executions in 2010, with a total of 46. Sixteen states have abolished the death penalty. Illinois did so this year. The level of public support for capital punishment in the United States has stayed relatively steady during the last decade, according to Gallup. Five out of the last 10 years, 64% of Americans have backed the death penalty in cases of murder. About three in 10 oppose executions. Amnesty sees hope in the 25% decline in executions as the group pushes for abolishment. ""Any country that continues to execute is flying in the face of the fact that both human rights law and UN human rights bodies consistently hold that abolition should be the objective,"" Shetty said. ""A world free of the death penalty is not only possible, it is inevitable,"" he said. ""The question is how long will it take?""","China maintains secrecy over its use of the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. military strike in southern Somalia Sunday was targeting Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of Al-Shabaab, the Somali-based group with ties to al Qaeda, according to three US officials. A drone operated by the U.S. Defense Department fired a Hellfire missile at a vehicle killing those inside, the officials said. But as of Tuesday, the Pentagon was unable to confirm whether Godane was killed, although he was the intended target. The military was authorized to try to kill Godane because of current intelligence indicating he posed an ""imminent threat"" against U.S. interests in the region, one official said. ""We have to be able to prove he was in the process of planning additional attacks,"" the official said. The official would not elaborate on what the intelligence might be. The officials confirmed this information in response to questioning from CNN, but declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation. Officially, the Pentagon has only described the target of Sunday's strike as a ""senior leader"" affiliated with al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab. Godane has been a driving force behind Al-Shabaab declaring its affiliation to al Qaeda and has pressed for the group to launch attacks beyond Somalia. In recent years, U.S. officials had considered Al-Shabaab to be diminished in strength, but after the attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last year, officials have worried the group has demonstrated a renewed capability. The U.S. still sees the limited Western presence in Somalia as a potential target for Al-Shabaab, but the concerns also focus on U.S. targets throughout the Horn of Africa, the official said. U.S. officials are waiting for DNA evidence as well as intelligence gathered from local Somalis on the ground before they can confirm Godane was in the vehicle and killed by the drone strike. Somali officials have said the man killed was Sahal Iskudhuq, an Al-Shabaab operative who was close to Godane and involved in planning attacks over the years. The latest strike comes after a failed raid last year by U.S. Navy SEALS aiming to capture a man known as Ikrimah, who U.S. officials said was a senior militant with ties to al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday he told government lawyers to object to a court-ordered release of additional images showing alleged abuse of detainees because the release could affect the safety of U.S. troops and ""inflame anti-American opinion."" President Obama discusses the alleged prisoner abuse photos at the White House on Wednesday. Releasing the photos could have a ""chilling effect"" on further investigations of detainee abuse without adding to the understanding of past abuses, he said. The Pentagon was set to release hundreds of photographs of prisoners in detention facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. The photos ""are not particularly sensational, especially when compared with the painful images that we remember from Abu Ghraib,"" Obama said, referring to the Iraqi military prison where photographs released in 2004 of detainees being abused and humiliated sparked widespread outrage. ""But they do represent conduct that didn't conform with the Army manual."" Obama reiterated that any future abuse of detainees is ""unacceptable"" and ""will not be tolerated."" The publication of the photos would not add any additional benefit to investigations being carried out into detainee abuse -- and could put future inquires at risk.  Watch the president discuss his detainee photo decision » . ""The publication of these photos would not add any additional benefit to our understanding of what was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals,"" Obama said. ""In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them would be to further inflame anti-American opinion, and to put our troops in greater danger."" The announcement Wednesday was a reversal of what White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said last month, when he told reporters the White House had no problem releasing the photos. Before Obama spoke to reporters, Gibbs said Wednesday afternoon that there was ""a lot of back and forth in [Obama's] mind over the course of several weeks about ensuring that this protected those that keep us safe, that it protected our national security."" iReport.com: Should photos be released? The release was ordered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. It followed Obama's decision to release Bush-era CIA documents showing the United States used techniques like waterboarding, considered torture by the current administration.  Waterboarding 'a mistake' » . Obama's decision ""makes a mockery"" of his promise of greater transparency and accountability, ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said. ""Essentially, by withholding these photographs from public view, the Obama administration is making itself complicit in the Bush administration's torture policies,"" Singh said. ""The release of these photos is absolutely essential for ensuring that justice [is] done, for ensuring that the public [can] hold its government accountable, and for ensuring that torture is not conducted in the future in the name of the American people."" Singh said his organization is prepared to ""do whatever it takes"" to have the photos released. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wednesday that grave concerns coming from top military brass may have influenced the president's decision. ""What's motivated my own change of heart on this and perhaps influenced the president is that our commanders ... have expressed very serious reservations about this ... and that the release of these photographs will cost American lives,"" Gates said. ""That's all it took for me,"" he added. Democrats in the Senate were mostly quiet on Obama's reversal on Wednesday. But Sen. Russ Feingold, of Wisconsin, said he at least initially disagrees with it. ""I am generally opposed to keeping the American people in the dark for no other reason than to shield misconduct, avoid embarrassment or other reasons not pertaining to national security,"" Feingold said in a written statement. ""From what I've heard so far, I'm not convinced there is a compelling reason these photos shouldn't be released."" Two Democratic congressmen had different reactions to Obama's decision. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York said he thinks ""the administration may be very well justified in withholding the pictures."" Nadler, who said he agrees with the ACLU ""98 percent of the time -- but not here,"" said he had not seen the photos but he doubted they provided any more information than was in Bush-era memos recently released. ""Get all the memos out, get everything out ... but with these pictures it may be that they're dangerous, and that's a legitimate concern,"" he said. But Rep Lynn Woolsey of California said, ""I would have preferred that they were out there."" ""We have so much to do. It's such a distraction,"" Woolsey added. ""Get these pictures out there and get it behind us."" The ACLU said the Pentagon had agreed to release a ""substantial"" number of photographs by May 28. Officials at the Pentagon said the photographs are from more than 60 criminal investigations between 2001 and 2006 and show military personnel allegedly abusing detainees. ""The disclosure of these photographs serves as a further reminder that abuse of prisoners in U.S.-administered detention centers was systemic,"" ACLU National Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer said before Obama's decision. ""Some of the abuse occurred because senior civilian and military officials created a culture of impunity in which abuse was tolerated, and some of the abuse was expressly authorized."" Singh added that the photographs ""provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel was not aberrational but widespread, reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib."" But Pentagon officials reject ACLU allegations that the photos show a systemic pattern of abuse by the military. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the Defense Department has ""always been serious about investigating credible allegations of abuse."" ""The policy of the Department of Defense is to treat all prisoners humanely, and those who have violated that policy have been investigated and disciplined,"" he added. More than 400 people, Whitman said, have been disciplined based on investigations involving alleged detainee abuse. The discipline ranged from prison sentences to demotions and letters of reprimand. The Pentagon initially wanted to prevent the images from being made public, but decided to release them after losing two court cases, according to Whitman. ""We felt this case had pretty much run its course,"" he said prior to Obama's decision. ""Legal options at this point had become pretty limited.""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama will no doubt attempt to use Thursday's meeting with Pope Francis as a platform to promote his political agenda at home, especially as it relates to poverty and income inequality. It's no secret that Pope Francis has made these issues central components of the first year of his papacy -- nor that the president has already tried to exploit this. Not long after the pontiff released his 47,000-word apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium, Obama lifted language directly from the document in a partisan speech of his own. But the attempt to tether himself to Pope Francis is an awkward and ultimately doomed one. 5 things you didn't know about Popes and Presidents . For one, the president is currently facing the largest religious liberty class action lawsuit in American history. Of the 300 and counting plaintiffs suing the Obama administration on religious freedom grounds, perhaps most famous are the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns founded to care for the impoverished and dying elderly. Another well-known plaintiff is Notre Dame, the university where the president loudly promised to keep conscience rights intact with the health care overhaul. It was the religious liberty version of the ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" speech. In 2011, the president stripped the U.S. Conference of Catholics Bishops of its longstanding funding for human-trafficking work because of the Bishops' conscientious objections to referring victims to abortions. In 2012, he had his lawyers work to strike down the ministerial exception in federal workplace discrimination law, which assures houses of worship the right to employ religious leaders according to doctrine. Throughout his presidency, he has come under repeated criticism for his numerous aggressions on people of faith, be they rhetorical or legal. Not only is the president under fire for religious freedom violations on his own soil, he has held power during a period of significant unraveling of religious freedom internationally. Egypt is in a state of crisis, with Coptic Christians experiencing the worst persecution they have known in centuries. Countless other religious minorities have fallen into peril: Catholics in Vietnam and Nigeria, vangelical Christians in Indonesia, Buddhists and Muslims in China, and Baha'is in a number of Middle East nations, to name just a few. Anti-Semitism is on the rise globally, most especially in parts of Europe and certain Latin American nations like Venezuela. He left vacant, for years, the position of U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Liberty. He stood by silently as the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) was nearly defunded. He then appointed Sen. John Kerry -- who nearly let it perish in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, even after 19 of his colleagues sent him a letter pleading with him to give the bill ""prompt consideration"" and to reauthorize USCIRF ""without further delay"" -- as his secretary of state. Under Obama's watch, the State Department has stepped in to defend believers on death row for their faith -- heroes like Pastor Saeed Abedini in Iran -- only when the noise from nongovernmental organizations grew deafening. With regards to diplomacy with the Vatican, the president has already shown his goodwill by relocating the Vatican Embassy, to the outrage of some American Catholic groups, who considered it a major downgrade. And then there is his position on abortion. While Pope Francis has called on Catholics to approach the church's unchanging teachings on issues like abortion with greater mercy and sensitivity towards pregnant women in crisis, he has strongly affirmed the position that every human life is worthy of legal protection, from conception until natural death. The president has the most extreme views on abortion of any American president, even opposing life-saving support for babies born of botched abortions when he was a state senator in Illinois. The most recent keynote speaker of Planned Parenthood's annual gala  can't have much common ground with the head of the world's largest institution that opposes abortion. Pope Francis is not just the head of the largest religious institution in the world; he is also the head of a sovereign nation-state. It is fitting and appropriate that he would sit down with the leader of the free world. It's equally fitting and appropriate, however, that President Obama show a little sobriety and public honesty about his relationship with a church that is collectively suing him at home. Whether we can expect this from the recipient of the 2013 Politifact ""Lie of the Year"" award, however, is a different story. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- The former head of intelligence of Guinea Bissau was shot dead in the capital late Sunday, hours after the peaceful conclusion of the country's presidential elections. Col. Samba Djalo was shot seven times, officials said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and authorities did not have a motive, said Interior Minister Fernando Gomes. Djalo served as the country's intelligence chief during a time when many key political figures were assassinated, including a high-ranking parliamentarian and an independent presidential candidate. He was overthrown along with then-Army Chief of Staff Jose Amora Induta in a mutiny in April 2010. Both were jailed briefly but later released, and no charges were filed. Meanwhile, elections were held without incident Sunday in the west African nation, with nine candidates vying for the seat of the president. About 180 international observers oversaw the voting. The elections were triggered by the January death of President Malam Bacai Sanha at age 64 after a long illness. Sanha became president in September 2009, months after the assassination of President Joao Bernardo Vieira. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.6 million gained independence from Portugal in 1974. Those conflicts ravaged the nation's infrastructure and economy and left it among the poorest in the world. Despite Sanha's coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. To date, no democratically-elected president has served a full, five-year term. Guinea Bissau will announce the results of Sunday's elections in about a week.","Djalo was shot seven times, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Giant jellyfish descend on the Sea of Japan, causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind. A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005. Sounds like a great sci-fi flick. But it's not. It's real and a nightmare for Japanese fishermen. The massive sea creatures, called Nomura's jellyfish, can grow 6 feet (1.83 meters) in diameter and weigh more than 450 pounds (204 kilos). Scientists think they originate in the Yellow Sea and in Chinese waters. For the third year since 2005, ocean currents are transporting them into the Sea of Japan. Monty Graham, a marine biologist at Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents. He said they stay together in packs and as they drift northward, they get caught in fishermen's nets. The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world. But Nomura's stands out because of its enormous size. ""The sheer size of them, individually, makes them fairly spectacular,"" Graham said. Spectacular, perhaps, to scientists, but perilous to villagers along the Japanese coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past. They had giant-jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007, and because they've recently been spotted in the Sea of Japan, they're bracing for another, potentially harmful wave this summer. The jellyfish destroy fishermen's nets, getting trapped in them, tearing holes and ruining catches. Fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers. When swarms of giant jellyfish tear them, the result is devastating. ""Communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets,"" Graham said. ""When these nets get wiped out, it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community."" The good news is that previous attacks have prompted Japan to put in place a warning system for fishermen. While they still risk losing a big catch, they can, at least, save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish. It's not clear why waves of Nomura's jellyfish have made it to the Sea of Japan in recent years. Some have speculated that overfishing, pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on Nomura's jellyfish in the polyp stage. However, no one is certain, Graham said.","Nomura's jellyfish seen in Sea of Japan for third year since 2005 .

"(CNN) -- British police were told in March this year that missing girl Madeleine McCann may have been kidnapped by a pedophile ring which followed her three days before her abduction, according to reports. Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007 after being left at a holiday apartment in the Algarve region. Britain's Daily Telegraph and The Sun newspapers both reported Thursday that an email released this week as part of the documents compiled by the Portuguese investigators probing Madeleine's disappearance revealed the connection to the ring. Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared May 3, 2007, while she was on holiday with her family at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide. According to the newspapers, the email was sent on March 4 by a London-based Metropolitan Police intelligence officer to Leicestershire police -- Madeleine's home county -- who then forwarded it on to investigators in Portugal more than a month later. In the email, which both newspapers printed a copy of, the officer writes that ""intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken. ""Somebody connected to this group saw Maddie, took a photograph of her and sent it to Belgium. The purchaser agreed the girl was suitable and Maddie was taken,"" the officer wrote. The Daily Telegraph reported the Portuguese police then asked Interpol to investigate. However, nothing appears to have come of the lead.  Watch how Madeleine McCann may have been abducted to order » . Belgium has already featured in the case, with a reported sighting on the Dutch/Belgian border last August already discounted. The case files, released by the Portuguese investigators this week after they shelved the investigation for lack of evidence last month, have provided a raft of leads for the media to report. On Tuesday, the documents revealed a previously undisclosed sighting of Madeleine in the Netherlands shortly after her disappearance. The possible sighting of Madeleine in May 2007 stemmed from a report by a Dutch shopkeeper, who told authorities she encountered a little girl in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. She said the child identified herself as Maddie and said she was taken from her mother while on holiday. ""I start to ask where her mommy was,"" Anna Stam said. ""She couldn't tell me that. I wanted to give her a balloon, but she didn't want that. She only wants her mommy, she said. And she said that these people took her from her mommy."" At one point, authorities had named the girl's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, as ""arguidos,"" or suspects, along with a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor's office said authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them ""arguidos."" After closing the case, police turned their case file -- containing up to 30,000 pages -- over to attorneys and private investigators working for the McCanns. The McCanns have vowed to keep searching for their daughter. .","Portuguese police case file reveal more leads in Madeleine McCann disappearance .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have unveiled their itinerary for their visit to New Zealand and Australia next month -- but it's unclear whether Prince George will be attending engagements with them. Announcing the royal couple's planned engagements on the April 7 -25 visit, the Prince's private secretary identified occasions at which the youngest royal might be present, but kept an element of suspense: . ""George being just a little over eight-months-old by the time they travel, I'm sure you will appreciate that the couple will have to make a final decision on those moments much closer to the time."" With Prince William second in line to the British throne and his young son third, Queen Elizabeth II had to give permission for both to travel on the same plane. One of the engagements earmarked for a potential appearance for Prince George is the opening of the Bilby Enclosure at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. The Australian government made a donation to the zoo for its bilby preservation program when George was born and the enclosure is to be named after him, the palace said. On its website, the zoo said the Australian government had given a bilby to the young prince to ""adopt."" Last month, Australasian media seized on reports Australia's incoming governor general had apparently let slip that George would make his first official visit Down Under. ""They'll bring with them Prince George the little one,"" Peter Cosgrove was quoted as saying, after a visit to the Queen at Buckingham Palace. After reporters tried to clarify the comment, Cosgrove appeared to back-track, saying ""I hope he's coming."" Prince Charles and Princess Diana first took Prince William to New Zealand and Australia in 1983, and he was photographed taking his first steps on the lawn of Government House in Auckland, New Zealand. It will be the Duchess of Cambridge's first visit to either country, while the Duke last visited New Zealand after the devastating 2011 earthquake in Christchurch. On this trip, the royal couple will visit the city together and stop to remember the 185 people killed. The royal couple were looking forward to their trip to both countries ""immensely,"" Kensington Palace said. ""There's no hiding the enthusiasm for the visit by both the Duke and the Duchess. The Duke, because he has been before; and the Duchess because she has never been to either country but has wanted to do so as long as she can remember. ""The Duke has no doubt that his wife will fall in love with New Zealand and Australia every bit as much as he did, some years ago."" The pair may not always be in complete agreement on their trip, however. Kensington Palace said the Duke and Duchess were ""just a little competitive"" and some of the events on the itinerary will pit husband against wife. The royal couple will board separate Team NZ America's Cup yachts for some informal racing in Auckland and coach rival teams in ""rippa"" rugby, a non-contact version of Rugby Union, in the South Island city of Dunedin. ""Again, I think we can expect some pretty competitive outbursts,"" the palace said. A century after the outbreak of World War I, the tour will also see William and Kate paying tribute to both countries' war dead and visiting military bases. Their last day will be April 25 -- ANZAC [Australian and New Zealand Army Corps] Day, which originally marked the landing of soldiers from both nations at Gallipoli, Turkey, in 1915. In the eight-month campaign fought there, 2,721 New Zealanders and 8,709 Australians died, before the allied forces withdrew. The day is now a tribute to those who have died in all conflicts. The Duke and Duchess will plant a seed from a pine tree at the site of the battle at the Australian War Memorial in Australia's capital city, Canberra, before returning to London.","Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit NZ and Australia from April 7 to 25 .
