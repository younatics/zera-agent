"By . Emily Crane . A middle-aged woman had sex with a 15-year-old boy out of depression and loneliness not because she was a calculating predator, a judge has been told. Kylie Fiona Henry's lawyer said her client's behaviour was not pre-meditated but had been an 'appalling lack of judgment'. The 40-year-old mother of three children was acquitted in November of raping the boy at her Adelaide home in April 2011. But the South Australian District Court jury found the former school canteen manager guilty of the less serious charge of unlawfully having sexual intercourse with him. Kylie Fiona Henry, 40, hides her face as she leaves her sentencing hearing in Adelaide after being convicted of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old boy . The teenager told an earlier sentence hearing that Henry 'robbed him' of his first sexual encounter and said the incident left him scared and confused. 'I felt ill, I can't trust women and I hate them,' he said. At her trial, Henry denied having sex with the boy but said she did have a passionate dream about them having sex. When she woke up she thought 'that was a good dream and then I realised who it was and then I thought that is disgusting, that is just wrong'. More... Woman, 22, lured 13-year-old neighbour into sexual relationship... and went on to have THREE of his children . 'I came to Australia as a bride... then my husband forced me to work in a brothel': Shocking study reveals how women are being trafficked as sex slaves and servants . On Wednesday, her lawyer Elizabeth Mansfield said Henry now admitted the offence, was embarrassed and ashamed, and seriously regretted the harm and hurt she had caused her victim. She cited a psychologist who found Henry's actions were those of a long-term depressed and lonely woman, rather than those of a predatory, calculating woman. Ms Mansfield urged the judge to suspend any jail term, saying the offending involved one isolated, brief incident and was at the lower end of seriousness for such matters. But prosecutor Ian White said an immediate custodial sentence should be imposed. He said the offending had a serious effect on the boy and noted the need to protect children from such behaviour. Henry will be sentenced on June 6. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Kylie Fiona Henry now admits to having sex with 15-year-old neighbour .

"By . Amanda Williams . A BBC journalist was filmed giving a Nazi salute and goose stepping while filming a documentary about anti-Semitic football fans in Poland and Ukraine. Chris Rogers was caught marching with one finger under his nose, as crew reportedly looked on. The BBC Panorama documentary Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate, was filmed two years ago ahead of the tournament in Poland and Ukraine - but details of the gaffe have only just come to light. Reporter Chris Rogers near the LKS football stadium in Lodz, Poland. It has been claimed that he was caught marching with one finger under his nose, as film crew reportedly looked on and laughed while on location for a BBC documentary on Nazi football fans . Mr Rogers - a former Newsround children's television presenter - admitted that he displayed a 'lack of judgment'. He said: 'I fully accept that some of my behaviour, which was intended as a joke, was deeply inappropriate particularly given the seriousness of what we were filming. 'I apologised and was strongly reprimanded by the BBC. I might have displayed a lack of judgement but none of this detracts from the serious football racism exposed in the programme.' There was an internal probe into Mr Rogers' behaviour, and he was temporarily frozen out of the show by a 'livid editor'. A spokesman said that Mr Rogers was freelance and had not been used for the Panorama programme in two years after the incident. They added: 'Chris Rogers has apologised for his behaviour. 'We took the appropriate action at the time  - two years ago - and now regard the matter as closed. 'The programme revealed serious racial abuse and violence in the host countries ahead of Euro 2012. Allegations were made in the Polish press at the time which were looked into and found to be completely untrue and we fully stand by the programme.' At the time the documentary aired, one of the interviewees claimed he had been 'exploited' by the programme makers - something which the BBC strongly refuted. Jonathan Ornstein,  executive director of the Jewish Community Centre of Krakow, gave an interview for the Panorama programme, and said he had been 'exploited' during the . hour-long talk with the corporation as it 'completely disregarded . anything positive said and aired only comments critical of Poland'. Today he told the MailOnline: 'I think it's shocking and I think that it again reinforces the need to take another look at the whole programme that was produced. 'I have been saying from the beginning that this is someone that was coming in with an agenda. 'Looking at the issue of racism in Poland while at the same time making light of it in this way is the height of hypocrisy.' Mr Rogers at the Patriot Training exercise in Ukraine. The BBC Panorama documentary Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate, was filmed two years ago ahead of the tournament in Poland and Ukraine - but details of the gaffe have only just come to light . Mr . Ornstein, an American-born Jew who has lived in Poland for 13 years . says the images used were also selective. 'I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source', he said at the time. Footage from the documentary showing anti-Semitic chants and racist monkey noises aimed at Black football players prompted former England captain Sol Campbell to warn fans not to travel to Poland and Ukraine otherwise 'you could end up coming back in a coffin.' The programme also showed south Asian fans in the Ukraine being attacked at one game and crowds giving Nazi salutes at another.

"By . Becky Barrow . and Rob Davies . Business Secretary Vince Cable says headhunters should submit all-women shortlists of candidates for top jobs to solve Britain¿s chronic shortage of female executives . Headhunters should submit all-women shortlists of candidates for top jobs to solve Britain’s chronic shortage of female executives, Vince Cable said yesterday. Just one in five top jobs in the FTSE index of the UK’s 100 biggest public companies are held by women. Yesterday the Business Secretary slammed Glencore Xstrata, the mining giant, for failing to have even a single woman in its boardroom. It is the only company left in the FTSE 100 to still be an all-male club, but has finally pledged to sold the problem by hiring a female director by the end of the year. Speaking to Woman’s Hour on Radio 4, Mr Cable said the lack of women at Glencore is ‘a bit of a disgrace, to be frank’. Later, when asked about headhunters being able to put forward all-women shortlists, he said: ‘You know, we’d like to see that happening.’ Under the Government’s voluntary code, 25 per cent of directors in the FTSE 100 should be women by 2015. When Lord Mervyn Davies established the code in 2011, the figure was just 12.5 per cent, but the latest figures show it has jumped to 20.7 per cent. The attitude of some senior men to female colleagues offers an insight into why so many women are being held back in their careers, and doing jobs which are beneath them. Just four years ago, there were 21 companies in the FTSE 100 which had no women in their boardroom, compared to only one today. Simon Murray, the former Glencore chairman, said in 2011: ‘Women are quite as intelligent as men. ‘They have a tendency not to be so involved quite often and they’re not so ambitious in business as men because they’ve better things to do. In March, a report, commissioned by the Government, said all shortlists should include the name of at least one ¿strongly recommended woman¿. File picture . ‘Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things. ‘All these things have unintended consequences. Pregnant ladies have nine months off. ‘Do you think that means that when I rush out, what I’m absolutely desperate to have is young women who are about to get married in my company, and that I really need them on board because I know they’re going to get pregnant and they’re going to go off for nine months?’ Mr Cable said the changes at Glencore are ‘long overdue’, but went onto criticise the firm for the fact that it has ‘consistently failed to act’. He said: ‘The vast majority of Britain’s top companies have got the message that a diverse top management team is good for business. ‘It is simply not credible that one company cannot find any suitable women.’ In March, a report, commissioned by the Government, said all shortlists should include the name of at least one ‘strongly recommended woman’. The report, written by the headhunter Charlotte Sweeney, also called for further investigation into the legality of putting forward women-only shortlists for jobs. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission is currently investigating the ‘legality’ of such lists, already used by the Labour party for selecting new MPs. The commission expects to publish its guidance this summer.","Cable also blasts mining company for having no women in boardroom .

"By . Kate Lyons . The ongoing feud of millionaire neighbours in Point Piper, Sydney, has flared up again after a tribunal ordered car wash king Anthony Sahade to stop behaving in a 'threatening and aggressive manner' toward his neighbours. Mr Sahade, 44, who owns the Crystal Car Wash chain has been involved with ongoing disputes with his neighbours since he and his wife Rita, 40, purchased the waterfront mansion on Wolseley Rd for $11.2million in 2005. The latest dispute led to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal ordering Mr Sahade to stop playing loud music, stop allowing visitors to park on the property, not to prune or destroy vegetation on shared property, and not to shine spotlights into his neighbours' homes. Scroll down for video . Anthony Sahade has been ordered to stop threatening and being aggressive to his neighbours. The car wash millionaire lives in a waterfront mansion in Sydney, which shares a turning circle, garage and pool with two apartments . He was also ordered not to 'threaten or act in an aggressive manner' toward his neighbours and his son Victor, 21, was ordered not to drive on the property in a 'dangerous and noisy manner'. The ruling is the latest in a long string of legal disputes between the neighbours on the Point Piper block. The inharmonious block is made up of two apartments, owned by Carina Glister and businessman Eckhart Bischoff and his wife Celia, and the Sahades' waterfront mansion. The three properties share common property as part of a strata arrangement, including the entry, turning circle, garage, and pool. The shared areas have been a source of contention between the residents, who have been in and out of court with complaints against one another since May 2005. The residents of Wolseley Road in Point Piper have been in and out of court since Mr Sahade and his wife moved into the street in 2005 . Last year, Mr Sahade was accused of assaulting Mr Bischoff, 62, in a dispute about the demolition of a staircase on the block. The charges were dismissed by the Local Court, and police were ordered to pay Mr Sahade's legal fees of $24,200. Another charge was dismissed against Mr Sahade in 2007, after he was accused of throwing rocks at an arborist chopping down a neighbour's tree. Two neighbours have taken out apprehended violence orders against Mr Sahade, one did so after she alleged Mr Sahade pushed her into the communal pool. The relationship between the neighbours was described as 'toxic' and having degenerated to such a degree of disharmony that 'co-operation or reason' no longer existed, by Richard Buckley, senior member of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal. In 2007, charges that Mr Sahade threw rocks at an arborist trimming a neighbour's tree were dropped .","Millionaire car wash king, Anthony Sahade, 44 has been ordered to stop harassing his neighbours .

I asked if they were both going to be ok and she said yes. 'Apparently Emma was madly in love with her partner but I never knew him.

"By . Sean Poulter . Scottish Power has been ordered to pay £750,000 after millions of customers were hit with an extra fee of £180 a year because they paid their bills by cash or cheque. The high charges were part of a drive to persuade customers to pay automatically by direct debit. Customers who opt not to pay by direct debit can be charged a fee to cover the extra expense of processing cheques and cash, but it must not exceed the actual administration cost. Energy watchdog Ofgem said Scottish Power's fees were unfair and amounted to overcharging of £100 a year per bill. The £180 fee is thought to have hit Scottish Power's elderly customers particularly hard, because they are more likely to want to pay by cash or cheque . But the regulator has not told the firm to refund the money. Instead it must pay the £750,000 to the Energy Best Deal scheme, run by Citizens Advice, which helps people cut their bills and shop around for the best tariff. The £180 fee is thought to have hit Scottish Power's elderly customers particularly hard, because they are more likely to want to pay by cash or cheque. It overcharged cheque customers between September 2009 and December 2012, forcing them to pay over the odds at the height of the financial crisis. But Ofgem said the practice had not 'harmed' customers. While Spanish-owned Scottish Power was billing an extra £180 a year, the rest of the industry was charging around £80. Ofgem began investigating the payments in December 2012, at which point Scottish Power cut the fee by almost half to £97 and subsequently to £95. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Energy firms are taking advantage of customers when they overcharge for different payment methods. Ofgem began investigating the payments in December 2012, at which point Scottish Power cut the fee by almost half to £97 and subsequently to £95 . 'With fuel bills up a third since 2010, costs are already very high, so people shouldn't be paying more than they have to in order to have a warm home and the lights on. 'With trust in energy suppliers at rock bottom, companies need to be up-front and clear about why prices between alternative payment methods differ and by how much. 'Ofgem is right to hold Scottish Power to account for not sticking to the rules and it is good that struggling consumers will benefit as a result of its action. 'It has taken four years for this issue to be resolved so we hope this action is a sign that Ofgem is getting on with current enforcement cases and can find a quicker way to sort these issues out for consumers.' Sarah Harrison, Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement, said: 'Suppliers need to clearly justify the different prices they set for different payment methods. 'Scottish Power did not have a robust process in place when setting their prices to ensure that the difference between their tariffs complied with Ofgem's rules. We've held them to account for this.' A Scottish Power spokesman said: 'Scottish Power has co-operated fully with this investigation. We recognise that we did not have a robust process in place but we are pleased that Ofgem has concluded its investigation and made no finding that any specific impact on customers resulted.' The firm was ordered to pay £8.5million last year after Ofgem found its sales staff had talked people into switching suppliers by making false claims. Just last week, German-owned energy firm E.ON was fined a record £12million for mis-selling by sales staff on the doorstep and over the phone. Compensation to customers could add up to another £8million. Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.","Scottish Power's fees deemed unfair by power watchdog .

"By . Daniel Mills . Tony Abbott has made yet another on-screen gaffe while being filmed during a radio interview on ABC this morning. The PM was caught winking at radio host Jon Faine, who was off-camera, during an interview with a  67-year-old grandmother who told Mr Abbott she worked as a female sex line worker to 'make ends meet'. She was calling to quiz the PM on his hard-lined stance on the budget, declaring she has been forced to work in the industry. Scroll down for video . Caught out: The PM winks when 67-year-old grandmother identifies herself as a phone sex line worker on ABC radio . But a spokeswoman for Mr Abbott later told Fairfax Media the wink was to assure the presenter he was happy to proceed with the call, not a judgment of the caller. Speaking on 774 ABC Melbourne, Gloria, from Warburton, challenged the PM over his government's tough-love budget. 'What do you suggest I cut out Mr Abbott? Food, electricity, firewood, Christmas, birthday presents to my grandchildren or should we all just die and get out of your way?"" the grandmother asked. She said she was 67, and had three chronic, incurable medical conditions. 'I just survive on around $400 a fortnight after I pay my rent.' 'I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. Now that's the only way I can do it.' Mr Abbott responded by saying he understood she was doing it tough, pointing out he was getting rid of Labor's carbon tax but leaving the compensation in place. Abbott's untimely gesture comes just hours after he snubbed a planned university visit this morning in Geelong. Student protestors launched a verbal spray directed at the PM calling him 'cowardly' for cancelling the trip. The AFP advised Mr Abbott and Education Minister Christopher Pyne against going, amid concerns for their safety. The Prime Minister and Education Minister Christopher Pyne were due to visit Geelong's Deakin University campus, but the trip was cancelled amid concerns over a fiery student backlash to the recent budget announcement.

The pair were planning to attend the opening of the university's carbon fibre research facility, and it was to have coincided with a national day of student protests against the government's higher education reforms, including removing caps on fees universities can charge. Instead, Mr Abbott will meet with Victorian Premier Denis Napthine today where he will answer to $80 billion worth of cuts to education and hospital funding announced in last week's budget. Christopher Pyne told the ABC's Lateline that the AFP advised he and the Prime Minister that by visiting the university they were putting their safety at risk. But national Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said Mr Abbott must start taking students serious and explain why he's worried about answering their questions. Safety at risk: Christopher Pyne was also set to join the Prime Minister on his tour to the opening of a carbon fibre research facility at Deakin University . 'I think the prime minister and his ministers are being a bit cowardly and trying to portray students as though they're violent rabble-rousers who are out to cause trouble, which isn't the case at all,' she told AAP. 'They're trying to make us sound like spoiled little brats who don't know how good we've got it. They have a very clear agenda.' Rowan Payne from the Deakin University student association and a member of the National Union of Students told ABC News Breakfast said the PM's snubbing proved that student voices were being heard. 'This budget represents the biggest changes to the tertiary education sector since the introduction of HECS,' he said. He said it's understandable that students feel aggrieved at the measures taken by the Federal Government. 'The glory days of free education in this country have been slashed and it looks like things are only going to get worse.'","Tony Abbott pictured winking and smiling while listening to 67-year-old sex worker during radio interview .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Jessica Jerreat . A Texas teenager whose date died in their hotel room after her senior prom has sent a series of emotional text messages to a friend suggesting she passed away following an overdose. The unidentified date frantically called 911 on Saturday morning after waking up in a North Houston Hyatt to find that 17-year-old Jacqueline Gomez was not breathing. Investigators said that the MacArthur High School senior showed no outward signs of injury and the results of her autopsy are pending. They added that her boyfriend is not suspected of any crime. Now text messages that he sent to one of Gomez's friends on Saturday afternoon have indicated that investigators believe she might have overdosed, the Houston Chronicle reported. Scroll down for video . Final night: Jacqueline Gomez, 17, sent this image of her and her boyfriend to a friend just hours before she was found dead in their hotel room, pictured. The boyfriend has suggested she died of an overdose . The friend, Justice Gonzalez, shared the messages with the Chronicle. She said she texted the date, who is not a student, after she saw pictures he had posted to Instagram showing him crying. 'They said she overdosed,' a text reads, likely referring to law enforcement. 'I woke up. I tried waking her but she wouldn't. I was screaming and crying telling her to wake up. But she didn't. She didn't.' He added that she had seemed 'perfectly fine and happy' when they left the prom and went to bed. He told authorities that they had consumed some alcohol before bed, and he added in the text messages that she had also taken the prescription painkiller hydrocodone. He said he did not know where they were from or how many she had taken. Mystery: Gomez was found dead hours after the end of her senior prom and autopsy results are pending . 'I shoulda took them away and flushed em,' he added. 'I miss my girl.' Friends and family previously denied Gomez was a hard-partying teenager, and said she spent her time working at a Kroger grocery and finishing up her high school studies. The couple had booked into Houston's Hyatt Hotel, where other students were also staying, at about 11pm on Friday following the 'Miami Night' prom. The next morning, the boyfriend called 911 to report that she was not breathing. According to KHOU 11, police found alcohol and prescription painkillers in the hotel room. Loss:  17-year-old Gomez is pictured with a male friend at the prom in North Houston on Friday night . Her boyfriend was taken in for questioning, but only so detectives could try to understand what had happened. Police said he is not a suspect. 'He was there. He knows everything, so we're just continually wanting to find out what happened,' Detective Mike Miller said. The unexpected death has shocked . Jacqueline's classmates at Aldine ISD MacArthur High School, who only . hours earlier had attended the prom with her. 'It's shocking. I can't believe it. I . mean, really, I can't believe it,' Leandra . Mendez, a 19-year-old classmate of Jacqueline's, told the Houston Chronicle. In the weeks leading up to the prom, which was held in the same hotel where Jacqueline's body was found, the teenager had been planning her dress with friends. Scene: Her boyfriend woke up in the Hyatt hotel to find her not breathing and frantically called 911 . Briana Hernandez, who worked at a store with Jacqueline, said prom was all the teenager had talked about for the past few weeks. 'Every day she would come to work and talk about it. She was so excited to go to prom,' Miss Hernandez told Click2Houston. She added that Jacqueline, 'who always came to work with a smile' had sent a picture of her in the hotel room just hours before she died. 'I told her right before left ... ""Just please be safe, Jackie"". And I gave her a hug, and . she left,' friend Justice Gonzalez said. Jacqueline had been due to attend Lone Star College, where she planned to study to become a pharmacy technician.","Jacqueline Gomez, 17, was not breathing when her boyfriend woke in their hotel room in Houston on Saturday morning .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . University of Notre Dame denied official recognition to a student club that supports traditional marriage. Students for Child-Oriented Policy (SCOP) was denied on April 30 by the school's Club Coordination Council (CCC) because its mission 'closely mirrored' other clubs' aims, Fox News reports. The club's Facebook page says it is focused on marriage policy in Indiana and how that may affect children's well-being. Not official: The University of Notre Dame, pictured, denied officially recognizing Students for Child-Oriented Policy . 'SCOP's overarching concern is that policymakers are failing to approach their task with a view to how those policies will affect children,' its page says. 'They seem to conceive of policy only as it will affect the stable, independent adult with resources.' This . spring, SCOP created a petition asking for Notre Dame 'to make a clear . stand in support of the true definition of marriage and to take serious . and sustained action to improve the public understanding of this natural . institution.' Protesting the club's aims, students formed another group, called Students Against SCOP, and started a petition of their own asking for it to not be officially recognized. The denial is 'not unusual,' Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Brown told the National Catholic Register. He said 31% of clubs were denied recognition in the last five years mainly because they had the same purpose as already-existing clubs. SCOP was one of six clubs denied this spring, he said. CCC President Jimmy McEntee told the Register that . SCOP's goals are not unlike those of Children's Defense Fund and Orestes Brownson Council. However, . the paper points out that Children's Defense Fund website was last . updated in 2005. McEntee declined to comment to MailOnline but said that he stood by the council's decision. Think of the children: Group Students for Child-Oriented Policy asked Notre Dame 'to make a clear stand in support of the true definition of marriage' with children's well-being in mind . Law professor Gerard Bradley, who is the club's prospective faculty advisor, said in a statement 'there is no substantial overlap or redundancy' between SCOP and the other two clubs. Bradley said this misunderstanding may be due to 'utter ignorance' about the club's purpose or possibly 'sheer hostility against what SCOP stands for.' 'Either way - ignorance or hostility - this decision reflects very badly on the University of Notre Dame,' Bradley said. He said he expects University President Father John Jenkins to reverse the decision. Requests for comment to the university were not immediately returned.","Students for Child-Oriented Policy .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . Oregon Senate candidate Monica Wehby harassed her husband, slapped him, pulled his hair and threw objects at him as they were going through a divorce, he told police. The accusations have emerged in a 2007 police report that was made public on Monday - less than a week after another report showed an ex-boyfriend claimed she was stalking him. The news also comes as the Tuesday deadline approaches for voters to return their ballots in Oregon's all-mail primary. The latest report, dated December 2007, said Wehby's ex-husband, Jim Grant, called police saying his 'soon-to-be ex-wife' was throwing items at him inside the Portland home they still shared. Accused: The ex-husband of Monica Wehby, a Senate candidate in Oregon, called cops on her in 2007, claiming she had harassed him and was throwing items at him during an altercation at their home . The report, which was first reported by The Oregonian, says Grant told an officer he 'is tired of the ongoing harassment by his wife'. He said that they were just weeks away from finalizing their divorce. Grant, now 49, told police that over the previous year, Wehby had pulled his hair, slapped him and thrown items at him. On the night he called, he said Wehby slapped him with a pad of paper. He also admitted to the officer that he'd 'been violent with her' over about three years. The report does not elaborate, and Grant could not be reached for a comment by MailOnline. Wehby, who said she had a couple of drinks at a party earlier that night, denied hitting Grant with a pad of paper and said Grant had began swearing and yelling at her while she was on the phone. Family: Wehby has 4 children with her ex-husband (three pictured). No charges were filed after he called cops . She confirmed that he had been physical with her in the past and had documented it with her doctors, but that she had never called police about it. The report, which notes their four children and Wehby's mother were also home at the time, did not result in any charges. It added that the couple agreed to return to their separate rooms. Another report from December 2009 shows that Grant also called police on her, saying she was refusing to leave the house until she saw the children. Report: Wehby's ex, Andrew Miller, called police last year reporting that she was stalking him . It noted that they shared custody of the children, but that she often let herself into Grant's home so that she could see them. The report says that she refused to leave the house until she could say goodbye to her children, as she was going on a trip. When Grant told her they were already in bed, she continued to bang on the door until they came downstairs. On Friday, a separate police report had showed Wehby's former boyfriend, Andrew Miller, called police last year reporting that she was stalking him and harassing his former employees. Miller later funded a super PAC attacking Wehby's Republican primary opponent, Jason Conger, and said he regretted calling police. 'Like a lot of women, I've gone through a divorce that was a trying time in my life for me and for my family,' Wehby, 52, said in a statement. 'I'm deeply saddened that such a personal matter, which bears no relevance to my Senate campaign, has been used as a political weapon to attack my character.' In previous primaries, fewer than half the ballots were cast in the last two days of the election, so the impact of the latest revelations on Wehby's fortunes will be limited. Through Sunday, 24 per cent of registered Republicans had cast a ballot.","Monica Wehby's ex-husband called cops as they were going through a divorce in 2007 saying he was 'tired of on-going harassment'

"By . Ted Thornhill . Three Wall Street CEOs have revealed how finding out that their sons were gay transformed their views on homosexuality. They all work in a macho environment and admitted to taking a dim view of gay rights. However, they began to champion them once their sons came out of the closet, they explained at a New York conference hosted by Out On The Street, an organization that promotes gay rights in the finance industry. Paul Singer, the billionaire CEO of Elliott Management Corp, said that he was filled with ‘fear and nervousness’ when he suspected that his son, Andrew, was gay, partly because of concerns about health and grandfatherhood. Opening up: Three Wall Street CEO's discussed at an Out On The Street conference how they felt when their sons came out. Pictured are Dan O'Connell (far left) and his son Jared, John Mack (center) sitting to the right of his son, Stephen, and Paul Singer (far right) sitting next to his son, Andrew . Opening up: Hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer (right), says his views on gay rights were transformed by his son, Andrew (left), coming out . But when Andrew confirmed that he was indeed homosexual, his mindset changed. He went from being ‘a solid 2.1’ out of 10, in terms of supporting  lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues, to a six. He added: ‘I think I’ve just risen from there,’ the Wall Street Journal reported. Mr Singer is now a solid supporter of LGBT rights and has even lobbied the Republican Party to support them. Former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack went on a similar journey. Sea change: Former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack (right) said he used to be 'downright cruel' to homosexuals, but his attitude to them changed completely when his son, Stephen (left), admitted he was gay . He described how he used to be ‘downright cruel’ to gay people in the North Carolina town where he grew up. But when his son, Stephen, came out in 1997, at the age of 23, his views softened dramatically. And the conversation was an easy one, in the end – partly because Mr Mack had already figured Stephen might be homosexual. Mr Mack explained that he just wanted to know if his son was happy. ‘That’s all I cared about,’ he said. Transformation: Dan O'Connell (left), the founder and CEO of private equity firm Vestar Capital Partners, said his son, Jared (right), coming out has made him much more accepting of gay rights . Dan O’Connell, the founder and CEO of private equity firm Vestar Capital Partners, meanwhile, said that he went from being ‘insensitive’ to homosexuality to being much more accepting, after his son Jared came out. ‘Better late than never,’ he said at the May 1 event. The CEOs were speaking as a study by Human Rights Campaign revealed that over half of homosexuals in the U.S haven’t come out to their colleagues.

"By . Alex Greig . A high-powered Seattle attorney has been sentenced to serve 25 years in prison for the rape of five massage therapists. Danford Grant, 49, pleaded guilty on May 7 to five counts third-degree rape and one count of first-degree burglary in a plea deal. Four of the victims wrote letters that were read at the sentencing detailing how Grant's crimes had devastated their lives. Scroll down for video . Indefensible: Danford Grant pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 25 years on Monday May 19 . The emotional statements prompted Judge William Downing to say of the victims, 'Their strength is as formidable as their innocence is unsullied.' Earlier this month, Grant plead guilty to the crimes. Had his case gone to trial, it was expected that his defense attorneys would have argued that he engaged in paid, consensual sex with the victims. Grant was arrested in September 2012 following a series of sexual assaults on massage therapists in Seattle, Shoreline and Bellevue in 2011 and 2012. He targeted the minority women, knowing they would have difficulty reporting the crime because of language barriers and cultural attitudes surrounding sex, said King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg. 'He thought he chose his victims wisely,' Satterberg said after Grant's guilty plea, reports the Seattle Times. Grant, a married father of three children, worked as an employment and business litigator and was a founding member of his own law firm. 'Violent rapist': The sentence - exceptionally high according to the state's sentencing recommendations for the crimes - had been agreed to ahead of the day's hearing . Investigators found that Grant's modus operandi was to go to Asian-run massage businesses after making an appointment under a fake name and using different phone numbers. He would lull the masseuse into a false sense of security by acting politely and mentioning his position as an attorney or even lying that he was a police officer or doctor to bolster his stature. According to Seattle PI, he would sometimes lie that his wife was dead and profess love for the masseuse before asking for sex. When the masseuse denied his request, he would violently attack her, often at knife-point, and try to rape her. Investigators discovered he would research massage businesses online and find out personal information about the massage therapists. None of the victims appeared in court for Grant's sentencing, but their letters spoke eloquently on the violence he visited upon their lives and the continuing trauma they suffer. Traumatic: Danford Grant stalked Asian masseuses online and then raped them violently during or after appointments he scheduled under false names . 'I really wanted to be present during the court proceedings, but I did not have the courage to see this person again. When I saw him on the news on May 5th, my entire body trembled and I lost strength in all limbs,' wrote one. She continued that she is now always scared, suffers panic attacks and becomes terrified if she sees a man on the street who resembles Grant. 'I will never forget about the humiliation, the dark shadow, and the trauma that this incident has brought upon me and I will be entangled in these feelings for the rest of my life,' she wrote. One woman told her husband she had been attacked with a knife, not divulging that she had also been raped, so great was her shame and distress. 'It has been 22 long months since the incident happened to me... I now suspect every male customer... Any small sudden motion by them will trigger me to think they are getting up to attack me. I'm particularly fearful of the ones who appear well-mannered and friendly because they would remind me of the bastard who tried to rape me,' she wrote. Write caption here . 'Heroic': Letters from victims of the former Seattle lawyer Danford Grant are read aloud during his sentencing, prompting the judge to comment that 'Their strength is as formidable as their innocence is unsullied' The woman said that she did not want to appear in court because in Chinese culture, it would cause herself and her family more shame and embarrassment. 'Maybe that's why the defendant had been picking on Asian victims who are more vulnerable and helpless,' she wrote. In one instance, Grant followed a masseuse back to her car after receiving a massage and ordered her into the the vehicle before driving somewhere secluded and raping her in the back seat. In another, he returned to a business where he had previously tried to rape a masseuse and forced his way in when he was denied entry before raping the masseuse. One victim said that she had undertaken many months of study to become a massage therapist and was horrified when she discovered that Grant's attorneys intended to argue that the women prostituted themselves. 'I read articles in the news and some reader's comments that said these were ""just Asian prostitutes."" Then the defense lawyer said this was consensual sex and prostitution. It made me sick to my stomach... [To become a professional therapist] I did everything that Washington state requires here. I spent a lot of time and I worked very hard to complete school... I am a good, moral woman and I strictly respect my career as a massage therapist and skin care professional,' she wrote. The husband of one victim also wrote a statement, describing coming home to find his wife on the floor in the fetal position in the aftermath of the attack. Lasting trauma: Grant targeted the women because he believed their language barrier and awe at his stature as well as shame and embarrassment would prevent them coming forward . He was finally caught after raping a masseuse at knife-point at a Greenwood spa when the owner and others arrived as he was leaving. A struggle ensued and police found him two blocks away from the parlor. A victim wrote that she weeps in the middle of the night and cannot bring herself to use a small knife in the kitchen because it looks similar to the knife Grant threatened her with. Grant himself read a long letter in which he detailed his past problems with addictions and 'commercial sex.' 'Although, the truth about what I did is dramatically different from what was alleged, I do not minimize my real wrongs and my apology for those particular wrongs is genuine and heartfelt,' he said. He painted himself as a dutiful husband and father and said he came to commit his crimes because he suffered anxierty and depression and 'commercial sex' was a way to escape his problems and 'distorted' his thinking. Mary Ellen Stone, executive director of the King County Sexual Assault Resource center, said Grant's victims have been exceptionally brave. 'It was likely that the Grant victims faced even more hesitation due to Grant's prestige, their own language barriers, cultural differences, and fear of deportation,' Stone said in a statement, reports Seattle PI. 'Their willingness potentially to face this man in trial is heroic.'","Danford Grant, 49, was sentenced to 25 years for raping five Asian massage therapist in 2011 and 2012 .

Ticker tape was usually thrown away once it had been used but a 13ft roll carrying 12 hours of updates somehow survived. It is the only one of its kind known to exist. The first dispatch, setting the scene of the invasion, codenamed Operation Overlord, read: 'The Allied invasion of Europe began today between midnight and 2.25am our time.

'An armada of four thousand ships and thousands of small landing craft invaded the northern French coast between Cherbourg and Caen - aerial pictures show our forces have already hacked their way inland a considerable distance.' A follow-up entry at 1.30pm (British time) read: 'Through clouds five thousand feet thick Allied air forces threw eleven thousand aircraft of almost every type into the grand invasion of Europe which started this morning - they were bombing and strafing miles of Normandy's beaches and flying inland to break the enemy's communications. 'Thunderbolt pilots returned to England from the invasion area and reported that Allied troops were piling onto the shore of France apparently with little opposition and that the skies had been virtually cleared of German planes.' One of the bulletins revealed how journalists relied on German sources for information during the early stages of the attack. It read: 'For our principal information we still are drawing on German sources...

'If the Germans are right the attack extends along a hundred miles of beach from Cherbourg at the northern tip of the Normandy peninsula which appears to have been the prime immediate objective.' Several hours into the attack the information was still sparse, but one note issued at 3.30pm reads: 'Prime Minister Churchill's expressed hope that we have achieved tactical surprise seems borne out by the developments. 'The initial German response has certainly been less than anticipated and the reaction of their air force has been surprisingly slow.' An hour later, it was noted that . Hermann Goering had told the German air forces the Allied invasion 'must . be fought off even if it means the death of the Luftwaffe'. In . the last bulletin on the roll, U.S. president Franklin D.

Interestingly it still carried information on global stock markets. 'Typically the paper would have just been thrown away after being used but somehow this particular one was saved and has survived the last 70 years in tact. 'Its history is unclear but it is now being sold by a private collector and we expect there to be a huge amount of interest in it.' The sale will take place at Bonhams' New York sale room on June 5. On June 6, 1944, Allied forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, on 'D-Day', beginning the liberation of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II. The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies' assault on German-occupied territory. The mission was the largest amphibious invasion in history with over 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians, involved and over 5,000 ships. There was an initial airborne assault with 24,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn. The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah. The timing of the operation was crucial, with commanders needing the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions. On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died with a further 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated at between 4,000 and 9,000. The landings were a turning point in the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe. 'The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!' Eisenhower said in an historic address after the invasion was launched. Last year, tourist boards along the Normandy coast launched the new D-Day initiative to promote what it calls the 'Secteur mythique' - where much of the action took place.","Stream of updates filed hourly as Allied soldiers stormed Normandy beaches .

'Thanks to the quick actions of our staff, they immediately grabbed her and stopped her from getting any further.' It not clear whether she will face additional charges over the escape attempt. Hansen's alleged victim, Elizabeth Conklin, 73, is recovering in the hospital from multiple injuries after being mowed down last Wednesday as she exited her car in the garage of her Waikiki apartment complex. Jill Hansen, 30, has been charged with attempted murder in relation to the incident, with police saying she ran into Conklin and would have run into her again, if not for a building worker running over and smashing the back window of Hansen's car with a crowbar, causing her to flee. Authorities initially believed the attack stemmed from an earlier road rage run-in, however Conklin said there was no such encounter, instead assuming Hansen was trying to steal her car. 'I parked in my normal parking place, and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance,' Conklin told ABC News. Lucky to be alive: Elizabeth Conklin, 73, who was thrown 20 feet across the parking garage of her Waikiki apartment complex, says her attacker was after her car . Charged: Jill Hansen, 30, has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly running down an elderly woman with her car in Waikiki on Wednesday . Jill Hansen was arrested on suspicion of intentionally striking a 73-year-old woman in a Wai­kiki parking garage with her car. She has a history of driving problems . In an effort to get Hansen's attention and stop her from hitting the woman again, a bystander used a crowbar to break one of the car's windows . Hansen is alleged to have followed the victim back to her apartment complex in Waikiki, waiting for her to get out of the car and then running her down . Jill Hansen is a self-described professional surfer and model . 'She saw my car, it was the car she wanted, she followed me (and) was going to kill me to get the car.' Conklin has thanked Chris Khory, the man who stopped Hansen, for saving her life. Khory told Khon2 that after knocking Conklin down, Hansen got out of her sedan, looked at the victim lying on the ground, got back in the car and reversed, preparing to hit her again. Khory, who works at the apartment complex on Kalakaua Ave, said he quickly grabbed a nearby crowbar and ran over and smashed Hansen's back window. Stunned, Hansen got out and fled, leaving behind her car. Police used it to track her down, arresting Hansen six hours later in the Manoa area, and later charged with attempted murder. She was remained on $1 million bail. However, before she was arrested, Hansen posted a picture of a BMW 328 wagon - believed to be the same car as Conklin's - along with a message about how she had turned professional as a surfer. 'I am becoming a professional! I have worked SOOOO hard to get to today. I am so greatful for all the support of the surfers and the ASP (association of surfing professionals),' Hansen posted on May 14, along with the picture of the car. Conklin was taken to hospital with cuts, bruises and a head injury. She was hospitalized in serious condition, emergency officials said. This is not Hansen's first run-in with police. She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. Wanted: Jill Hansen posted a picture of this car, a BMW 328 Wagon, as well as a waterfront home in Hawaii, in the hours after the alleged attempted murder and before she was arrested on Wednesday . Police used Hansen's car, which she left at the scene after running away, to identify her and track her down . Police arrested 30-year-old Jill Anjuli Hansen shortly after 7 pm on Wednesday . The incident occurred in the garage of the Diamond Head Apartments on Kalakaua Ave in Waikiki . Surfer Jill Hansen was arrested for attempted murder .

According to the court documents, Hansen's father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family. He has a restraining order against his daughter . Police said at about 11:40 a.m. Wednesday, Hansen followed the older woman through the parking garage's security gate and then intentionally hit the woman with her car after she had exited her vehicle . Police said Hansen and the older woman do not know each other, and there was no apparent motive . According to Insurance News Net, Hansen is known in Honolulu for being a worry on the roads. A member of the Mau­na­lani Heights Neighborhood Security Watch, who asked not to be identified, said the group alerted its members about Hansen last year after several incidents involving erratic driving and behavior. 'We needed everybody on the lookout for her - that's how scary it was,' the member said. 'All 500 members were eventually brought into the loop of this situation because it was so serious.' 'There were probably over half a dozen people that had been adversely affected by her driving. 'Two people almost run over by her, one person almost had a head-on collision with her.' Hansen was not arrested in connection with those incidents, the member said. Bad reputation: Jill Hansen was allegedly known around her neighborhood for her driving record, and not in a good way, sources say . According to court records, Hansen was cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time on Sunday. In that incident she was allegedly driving 72 mph in a 35 mph zone in Wahiawa.

"By . David Mccormack . and Snejana Farberov . Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston has been hit with fresh accusations of stealing. The current holder of the Heisman Trophy, Winston, 20, is rapidly earning a reputation for his off-the-field bad boy antics as well as his sporting prowess. Surveillance video footage emerged last week showing Winston shoplifting $30-worth of crab legs from a Tallahassee supermarket and now he has been accused of stealing soda. Scroll down for video . Florida State quarterback and current holder of the Heisman Trophy Jameis Winston, 20, has been accused of stealing soda from the Burger King restaurant last July . Audio of a phone call made to a non-emergency police hotline by the assistant manager at a Burger King near the Florida State University campus on July 21 last year has been made public by TMZ. According to cops, Winston allegedly entered the burger joint with three other men and began to fill ketchup cups with soda without paying for it. The assistant manager, who is female, can be heard telling the operator that she told Winston what he was doing was a crime but 'he said he didn't care.' The employee also said that Winston was 'causing a big scene out front' and 'fighting with me and refusing to leave.' The case was later dropped when the BK manager decided not to prosecute. Caught on camera: Officials in Florida released this surveillance video showing FSU quarterback Jameis Winston, 20, leaving a Publix supermarket without paying for an order of crab legs and crawfish . Audio: Listen to Burger King employee's call to the cops in 2013 . Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Last week officials in Florida released a surveillance video Winston shoplifting crab legs from a Tallahassee supermarket. The . silent clip recorded inside a Publix grocery store on April 29 showed . the star football player saunter into the supermarket dressed in shorts . and sandals, and heading to the back. Winston . could be seen picking up a $32.72 order of crab legs and craw fish . served on a tray wrapped in plastic from the seafood counter. He then stopped by the dairy section to . pick up a pack of butter and headed out the door after allegedly waiting . for an off-duty sheriff's deputy to pass. Winston . told deputies he walked out and forgot to pay for the 3lbs worth of Old Bay . seasoned steamed crab legs and a pound of Cajun seasoned crawfish. Watchful eye: Winston dressed in black is seen picking up a $32.72 order of seafood from a counter (left) and then heading to the dairy section for butter . But he said he didn't take the butter. He said he decided on the way out of the store that he didn't need it and placed it in a sale bin instead of returning it to the dairy cooler. Leon County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Crego who reviewed the security video wrote in a report that the quarterback and FSU baseball closer appeared to hang back at the exit to avoid walking in front of a law enforcement official. ‘Mr. Winston paused visibly near a . series of sale bins and allowed Deputy Graves to pass in front of him. The pause appeared to be an attempt to avoid walking in front of Deputy . Graves,’ Crego wrote . ‘Mr. Winston then walked behind Deputy Graves, passed all points of sale, and . exited the store without paying for the merchandise.’ The . report goes on to state that deputies were unable to determine whether . Winston took the butter or placed it in the sale bin. Evasion tactic: Officials say Winston paused at the exit to avoid being seen by this off-duty sheriff's deputy . Getaway: The 20-year-old college football star marched out of the store without paying for his food - but he later told police he simply forgot . Winston signed a civil citation admitting he committed petty theft and was suspended from FSU's baseball team for three games until he completed 20 hours of community service. ‘Mr. Winston apologized repeatedly and stated he wanted to “make it right,""’ Crego wrote. The 20-year-old Alabama native also released a public apology. 'I went to the supermarket with the intent to purchase dinner but made a terrible mistake for which I'm taking full responsibility,' Winston said in a statement issued on April 30. 'In a . moment of youthful ignorance, I walked out of the store without paying . for one of my items,' continued the youngest ever Heisman winner. 'I . realize that I am in the public spotlight and my conduct needs to be . above reproach.' Officials pointed out that the college student made no attempt to contact the supermarket and alert someone at Publix to his mistake. Hungry? Quarterback Jameis Winston #5 of the Florida State Seminoles pictured here after the 2014 Rose Bowl victory over Auburn, is likely not currently celebrating after news broke Wednesday of a criminal citation he received Tuesday for allegedly shoplifting crab legs from a Florida grocery store . Winston has had . previous run-ins with the law, including a 2013 investigation over an . alleged rape for which he was never charged. 'Over the last year I've learned that my accomplishments on the fields can be a wonderful thing for my school, teammates, friends, and family,' the athlete's statement said. 'At the same time, I must realize that my mistakes are magnified and can bring great embarrassment to all those who support me every day.' Winston was not arrested. Unless he fails to show up to community service, his record will remain clean. 'He got an adult civil citation,' a police source told Tomahawk Nation of the arrest alternative usually reserved for juveniles. 'If he completes the sanctions it will never show up on his record,' said the source. 'They are now doing it for minor misdemeanors for adults to lower crime rate.' The source also revealed the quarterback will be fined $30. No arrests: The current Heisman trophy holder also has an impressive record pitching for his school's baseball team, but he has a history of near misses with the law outside the alleged seafood incident . The incident allegedly occurred at a Publix, a staple in Florida grocery stores . According . to the SB Nation report, Winston has also faced police questioning over his alleged involvement in a long-running BB gun battle. News of Winston's wrongdoings come just weeks after the NCAA changed its rules to allow colleges to offer their athletes as much free food as they want. There was previously a cap placed at three free meals per day. The announced rule change came after Connecticut basketball guard Shabazz Napier's announcement during the Final Four in which he complained of players 'starving.' Winston is the nation's top-rated passer . and has led the top-ranked Seminoles (13-0) to a spot in the BCS . championship game against No. 2 Auburn on Jan. 6, his birthday. The . former five-star recruit from Bessemer, Alabama, made college football . look easy from his very first game. Hungry: UConn guard Shabazz Napier complained early in April that he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food. Days later, the NCAA announced a lifting of restrictions on free food provided to college athletes . On Labor Day night, on national television, Winston went 25 for 27 for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at Pittsburgh. 'I . can't explain how truly intelligent he is,' Florida State coach Jimbo . Fisher said. 'He always wanted to know why he had success or why he had . failure so he could either repeat it or fix it.' There . wasn't much failure on the way to becoming the third Seminoles . quarterback to win the Heisman. The last was Chris Weinke in 2000. Winston and . Florida State were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke . of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the . Tallahassee Police Department last December. The . dormant case was handed over to the state attorney's office for a full . investigation. A female student at Florida State accused Winston of . rape. Winston's attorney said the sex was consensual. During . three weeks of uncertainty, Winston continued to play sensationally, . while other contenders stumbled or failed to distinguish themselves.","The latest allegations against the Florida State quarterback are that he stole soda from Burger King last July .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A worker at a Red Robin in Missouri has been diagnosed with hepatitis A and now health officials fear that more than 5,000 customers may have been exposed to the disease. The infected individual has not been identified and the only detail that has been released is that they work at the Springfield, Missouri location. USA Today reports that the employee's condition was reported to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department on Tuesday and they have now called on anyone who ate at the location at any point in the last two weeks. Customer call back: An employee at this Springfield, Missouri Red Robin has hepatitis A and may have spread the disease to customers between May 6 and May 8 . Hepatitis A is a highly-contagious liver disease that can cause inflammation which, in turn, prevents the organ from operating properly. The disease typically spreads through contact with water or food that an infected individual has touched, making the employee's job at a fast food restaurant even more dangerous and susceptible to spread. 'Upon being informed of the incident, the Springfield Red Robin took all safety measures to ensure the well-being of our guests and team members including arranging the inoculation of all Springfield team members with the immune globulin prophylaxis shot,' Red Robin officials said in a statement. This is the second time this month that a Red Robin employee has been diagnosed with hepatitis A, though the earlier instance was at a Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania outpost. Passing through food: Hepatitis A regularly spreads when infected individuals handle food or drinks . In that case, the local health authority did not feel it was necessary to put out a call for the public to seek immediate medical treatment. That wasn't the case in the latest case in Missouri, as the county health department has announced that they feel anyone who ate at the restaurant between May 6 and May 8 should be immunized. 'We did extensive investigations through inspections and determined it was a significant risk and that we needed to notify the public and have some immunization clinics to try to prevent any further spread of hepatitis A,' Springfield-Greene County Health Department director Kevin Gipson said. Downward trend: The number of acute hepatitis A infections in the United States have dropped dramatically due to the development of a vaccine . The problem facing the containment process is that infected individuals do not necessarily display symptoms, though adults are more likely to feel nauseous and notice a spike in their temperature, a yellowing of their skin and vomiting. Most cases are deemed mild and do not require serious treatment, resolving itself in a few weeks without causing permanent damage, but that is not always the case. 'Any time we have these cases we err on the side of caution. We never take the public’s health for granted so we have scheduled a couple of clinics,' Mr Gipson said. This possible outbreak comes at a relative low point for the disease as the Centers for Disease Control have reported that while there were more than 30,000 cases of acute hepatitis A in the early 1990s but now the vaccine has led to only 2,700 acute cases being reported in 2011.","An employee at a Springfield, Missouri Red Robin has been diagnosed with hepatitis A and may have infected thousands of customers .
Health officials have set up immunization clinics to treat the liver disease .

"A U.S. judge has dismissed a federal lawsuit by Angelina Jolie's stunt double against News Corp for allegedly hacking into her voicemail. Eunice Huthart was the first alleged victim to launch legal action against the Murdoch empire in the U.S. over the allegations. The British 47-year-old, who won TV game show Gladiators, claimed The Sun and The News of the World intercepted her phone messages in an attempt to gather gossip about the Hollywood actress. Eunice Huthart was the first alleged victim to launch legal action against the Murdoch empire in the U.S. over the allegations . Rupert Murdoch's News Corp asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing it should have been filed in the UK where more than 600 hacking claims were being processed under a compensation scheme. Judge Michael W Fitzgerald, of the United States District Court Central District of California, has now ruled in favour of News Corp's motion to dismiss, radaronline.com has reported. The ruling said: 'The underlying facts here do not seem to be in dispute, at least by these parties. 'It appears, and certainly is alleged, that Plaintiff Eunice Huthart has suffered a grotesque invasion of her privacy. 'This harm arose for no reasons other than Huthart’s successfully pursuing a demanding career associated with Los Angeles and having a friend who likewise is at the summit of success in an industry associated with Los Angeles. 'Nonetheless, for reasons explained in this Order, the Court concludes that Huthart must obtain her relief from the courts of England and Wales.' Working together: Ms Huthart and Ms Jolie together on the set of 2010 spy thriller Salt . News International, the British arm of News Corp, has already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to celebrities and other public figures who were hacked by the News of the World. The stuntwoman claims that News . International papers used information found on her voicemail to uncover . Ms Jolie's relationship with co-star Brad Pitt during the filming of . 2005 hit Mr & Mrs Smith. Her . claims date back to 2004 and 2005 when she was apparently living with . Ms Jolie - she says the pair were close friends who 'travelled and . socialised together' as well as being colleagues on film sets. Ms Huthart worked as the actress' stunt double on Tomb Raider 2 and Beyond Borders as well as Mr & Mrs Smith. Around . the time covered by the complaint, the Sun and the News of the World, . which closed down in 2011 after revelations of widespread hacking at the . title came to light, ran a number of stories on the burgeoning romance . between Ms Jolie and Mr Pitt. The claim was the first hacking case Rupert Murdoch's media empire faced in the U.S. The stuntwoman claims that the source of many of the stories was her voicemail, as 'no one except Brad Pitt's bodyguard, Ms Jolie's bodyguard, their respective personal assistants and Plaintiff knew that Brad Pitt and Ms Jolie were now an ""item""'. The court papers also allege that Ms Huthart missed a number of deleted messages from colleagues and family members, leading to inconvenience and emotional distress. Among the messages from Ms Jolie which Ms Huthart never received were apparently 'hotel arrangements where she was staying, code names for hotels and individuals, dinner reservations, meet-up times and, on occasion, when she sought the help of Plaintiff during times of need'. News Corp has so far refused to comment on the allegations. The company has repeatedly denied that hacking took place at the Sun. The phone-hacking scandal came to light in 2001, when it emerged that the News of the World had hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler. The Sunday newspaper was closed down by Mr Murdoch, and the company has since paid out more than £200million in compensation and legal expenses related to the victims of hacking. A number of former News International executives are currently on trial for hacking-related offences.

"By . James  Nye . Incredible: Iria Wolnick (pictured) helped deliver the baby of Niser Saldana-Quilantan, 19, after the teenager was mortally wounded after a car crash in July last year . Around midnight on a hot summers night last year, Iria Wolnick was driving along the desolate US Highway 77 south of Corpus Christi, Texas, when she saw the burning wreck of an upturned SUV, which had catastrophically come off the road. The 36-year-old San Jose massage therapist pulled over and rushed to the wreck to find a young family of three had been been thrown from car as it flipped - a two year-year-old, his father and his mother, who was pregnant. The mother, 19-year-old Niser Saldana-Quilantan, asked if her unborn child was OK and it was then that an astonished Wolnick saw a huge cut on the woman's stomach, heard a baby crying and saw a head and tiny hand emerging from the wound. 'She kept saying, 'How's my baby? How's my baby?' said Wolnick according to Mercury News about the night of July 5. 'My reaction was to spring into action and do what I could.' Using . only her own instincts and what little first-aid training she knew, . Wolnick delivered the six-pound, 11-ounce baby, named Emma Lyn Anahi . Ortega through the wound in her mother's abdomen. 'The . baby’s head and one of her hands was protruded out of the laceration . that she had to her abdomen, and the baby was crying which is . unbelievable and wonderful,' said Wolnick to Valley Central. Tragedy: Niser Saldana-Quilantan (pictured) asked Wolnick to help her unborn child as she lay stricken on the floor after being flung from her SUV after a crash last year . Born: Baby Emma Lyn Anahi Ortega was delivered by Wolnick on the side of the road after the child's mother suffered fatal wounds . Survivor: Baby Emma lost her mother, but her father and brother made it through the accident . According to Mercury News a passing truck driver used his own shoelace to tie off the umbilical cord. The little girl's mother, who was eight months pregnant saw her baby girl born before she lost consciousness, but sadly died later on that evening in hospital. The two-year-old, Adrallis Ortega and his father, Edward Ortega were injured, but recovered. Wolnick was honored in San Jose on Wednesday morning by the CHP and the Texas Highway Patrol division, who presented her with a plaque. 'These days, a lot of people would drive right by, thinking it's someone else's responsibility,' said Lt. Jeremy Rowland of the Texas agency according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Honored: Iria Wolnick, of San Jose poses for a photograph with Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Benji Ramirez, (right) and Texas Department of Public Safety Lt.

If it hadn't been for her, two people would have died that night.' Captain Les Bishop of the CHP said he had never heard a highway rescue story quite like this one. 'For someone with limited training, to be acting only on instinct, to do something like this, well, she deserves this and a lot more,' he said. 'It's something you would expect from law enforcement or a paramedic, but from a citizen. It's truly extraordinary.' Wolnick was already traveling with a load on her heart that evening because she was driving to her mother's funeral. 'I was given the opportunity to bring life into the world in those conditions,' she said. 'It's not something that happens every day.'","Iria Wolnick encountered 19-year-old Niser Saldana-Quilantan who had been thrown from her SUV after a crash in Texas last year .

"By . Associated Press . FBI agents and other law enforcement officials will now be able to record interviews with suspects after the Justice Department overturned a longstanding policy. The new policy, laid out in a memo issued this week by Deputy Attorney General James Cole, establishes a 'presumption' that agents will record interviews with suspects who have been taken into custody but have not yet appeared in court. The policy, which is to take effect July 11, covers the FBI as well as the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service. More evidence: The reversal will allow agents to use the information they collect in interviews as proof in subsequent trials . That new standard replaces current practice, in which agents interview suspects without recording them, take handwritten notes and then produce a report summarizing the conversation. It addresses concerns from civil rights groups and defense lawyers who say the absence of recordings leaves too many ambiguities as to what precisely was said and whether agents' accounts are fully reliable. The policy is also intended to ensure that law enforcement has a clear record of any confession or critical statement, and that interviews with suspects are properly done. 'I think it is a tremendous step forward by the department in recognizing that having an accurate record of what is said in the custodial interrogation is helpful, both to the government and to the defense,' said Barry Pollack, a criminal defense lawyer in Washington. Decision maker: The reversal was laid out in a memo issued this week by Deputy Attorney General James Cole . He said one of the leading causes for false confessions is not having an accurate understanding of the context in which the statement was made . Still, he noted, the change is narrow in scope since it applies only to interviews with suspects who have already been arrested or are in custody. The policy change allows for some exceptions, including if the suspect objects to the recording, if the recording is not practical or if the information provided in the interview could jeopardize national security. The Arizona Republic posted the memo on its website. A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of memo. The spokesperson was not authorized to discuss a change that had not been announced and requested anonymity.","New policy will allow for a 'presumption' that all interviews with agents are recorded .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The daughter of ailing radio legend Casey Kasem says her stepmother could be desperate enough to steal the 82-year-old away to another country. Kerri Kasem's battle over her father with Jean Kasem heated up further this week after the millionaire former broadcaster turned up in Washington State with his wife after disappearing from hi Santa Monica care facility on may 7. 'It happens to be one ferry boat away from Canada,' Kerri told People in a piece published Tuesday. In the middle: 82-year-old Kasem is at the center of a family feud, likely fueled by the radio legend's multimillion dollar fortune . Desperate? Kerri Kasem, herself an experienced radio broadcaster, says her stepmother will stop at nothing to keep the radio legend's other children away from him . Kerri, 35, herself an experienced radio host, is on one side of a prolonged feud over her father's care with her former actress stepmother, Kasem's wife of 34 years. Kerri says that Jean dragged her father from his care facility just a day after her last visit with him. 'This poor man was moved in the middle of the night,' Kerri told People. 'This is no vacation. This is a man who has a feeding tube, hooked up to an IV and has dementia. This is not a man who needs to be in unfamiliar surroundings.' A judge last week expanded Kerri's powers determine whether her father is receiving adequate medical care amid his ongoing concerns about the health and welfare of the ailing radio personality. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel S. Murphy ordered Kasem's wife, Jean, to comply with court orders allowing doctors to evaluate her husband, and also allow his daughter Kerri to see him. He also ordered Jean Kasem to surrender her husband's passport and temporarily suspended her powers to determine her husband's medical care. Murphy's orders came after the second . hearing in a week in which lawyers for Jean Kasem have said they could . not disclose where Casey Kasem is located. Authorities found him in . Kitsap County in Washington last week after Murphy ordered adult . protective services to locate him, but the judge said the lack of . additional information and cooperation troubles him. The judge has appointed an attorney and doctor to evaluate Casey Kasem, but neither has been able to contact him or his wife. The former radio show host is suffering from a form of dementia called Lewy Body Disease, according to court records. Murphy ordered last week that Kasem, 82, could not be moved without another court order, and he stressed on Tuesday that Kasem should be medically evaluated as soon as possible. Jean Kasem was represented at Tuesday's court hearing by two attorneys from different firms, which added to Murphy's exasperation about the lack of information about her husband, his whereabouts and what actions she had taken. 'I'm not sure she's even complying with my order,' Murphy said. The judge said Kerri Kasem could hire an unarmed private investigator to help find her father if necessary. 'Wicked': Jean claims in court papers seen by MailOnline that she has unfairly been portrayed publicly as the villain in all their wrangling. She says the children have done nothing but 'disgrace' their father . Samuel Ingham, an attorney appointed to represent Casey Kasem, said he was troubled by information he had received that his client had been removed from a medical care facility in the middle of the night and the lack of cooperation he had received from Jean Kasem. Jean Kasem's attorney Craig Marcus pointed to statements by a sheriff's spokesman in Kitsap County in Washington that Kasem appeared to be receiving good medical care when he was located last week. Ingham said Kasem's family couldn't know for sure until after a doctor evaluated him. Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and he was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo.'","Kerri Kasem said Tuesday her ailing father's wife Jean Kasem could be capable of doing anything to keep his family from seeing him .

"By . Alex Greig . A trip to the lakeside turned to tragedy Tuesday when two men died after going swimming in Lake Michigan in Chicago. Two families out enjoying the warm weather are now mourning brothers-in-law Otmane Kassou, 40, and Ali Moufid, 36, who were pulled from the still-icy waters just after 4pm. They were taken to Mercy Hospital in 'extremely critical' condition, where they later died. Tragic loss: Ali Moufid (left)and Otmane Kassou (right) quickly succumbed to the icy waters of Lake Michigan on Tuesday afternoon . The two men were both immigrants from Morocco, working as taxi drivers and living in the suburbs of Chicago. According to the Chicago Tribune, Otmane Kassou went into the lake to fetch a toy for Moufid's young son that had fallen into the water. He was fond of the child and didn't hesitate to go into the lake in search of the toy, said witnesses. Kassou, a strong swimmer and former lifeguard in Morocco, could soon be heard calling for help, and Moufid jumped into the water to his aid. Unimaginable: Ali Moufid's wife Malika Oujbemah (pictured) called 911 when the two men failed to resurface after entering the lake . Malika Oujbemah (left) is in shock at the loss of her husband Ali Moufid (right), and says their son is asking for his father . Witnesses reported seeing two people in the water around 25 yards offshore and never seeing them resurface. 'We . got weather that’s right around 90, and everyone thinks the water is . that warm. It’s just above 50 degrees and that’ll really zap your energy . real fast,' Chicago Fire Chief Mike Fox told CBS. Ali Moufid's wife Malika Oujbemah, frantic, called 911 when she didn't see the men break the surface of the water. 'We were terrified. We didn’t know what to do,' Oujebemah told CBS. 'It was unimaginable.' Rescue divers dropped from a helicopter into the eight-foot-deep water and quickly found the men. Deceptive: Authorities say that despite the warm and sunny weather, the lake is still icy and can quickly sap energy from swimmers . Frantic: The two families went to the lakeside to enjoy the warm weather but their picnic soon turned into a nightmare . No swimming: Authorities are asking that no one enter the water until the beach opens and lifeguards are on duty following Tuesday's tragedy . 'He’s my best friend and we lost the best guy ever,' Bachir Fagrouche, Moufid’s friend, told CBS. Officials are telling people to wait until the beaches are open and lifeguards are on duty before swimming. In water that cold, fire officials said, it takes just a couple of minutes for hypothermia to set in. 'His son is asking about him. Oh my god, what shall I tell my son?' a devastated Oujebemah said. The wife of Otmane Kassou, Bouchra Kassou, described her husband as extremely fit and active. As well as being a former lifeguard, he was ex-military and a judo master who once represented the United States in international competition. Arrangements are being made to send the men's bodies back to Morocco for burial.","Brothers-in-law Otmane Kassou, 40, and Ali Moufid, 36, were pulled from Lake Michigan Tuesday .

He also wrote that the U.S. government was 'killing innocent civilians' and that he couldn't stand to see 'such evil go unpunished'. He also warns that America is 'fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven, so how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it.' The federal court filing was made in response to a motion from Tsarnaev's defense . team to supress the note and statements he made to FBI agents during his emergency . treatment shortly after his arrest last year because he had no lawyer . present. In the filing, prosecutors said that FBI . agents needed to question Tsarnaev at the time because they had to . determine exactly how the brothers had constructed their explosives and . whether they had any accomplices who may have posed a threat. 'The Marathon bombs were constructed using improvised fuses made from Christmas lights and improvised, remote-control detonators fashioned from model car parts,' prosecutors wrote. 'These relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the Tsarnaevs to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others.' Prosecutors also revealed that Dzhokahar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev crushed and emptied fireworks of their gunpowder to make the detonators for their bombs. Gunpowder is so fine that it would be expected to leave traces on their bodies and where they worked. Forensic: Investigators survey the site of a bomb blast on Boylston Street a day after two explosions hit the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts on April 16, 2013 . Fuses in the two devices detonated by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev used circuits from Christmas lights revealed prosecutors in court filings released on Wednesday in Boston . Capture: Members of a police S.W.A.T. team exit Franklin Street moments after 19-year-old bombing suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev  was apprehended on April 19, 2013 in Watertown, Massachusetts . However, 'searches of the Tsarnaev's residences, three vehicles, and other locations associated with them yielded virtually no traces of black powder, again strongly suggesting that others had built, or at least helped the Tsarnaev's build the bombs and thus, might have built more,' wrote prosecutors. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's legal team had not responded on Wednesday to the legal filing as the preparations for November's trial gather pace. The 20-year-old terror suspect ran over and killed his own brother last year in a confrontation with police just days after the April 15, bombings which killed three and injured hundreds. The younger Tsarnaev is facing federal charges that could result in the death penalty for his role in the deadly terror attack. The brother's also shot dead an MIT police officer before they unleashed a trail of destruction across Boston as they battled police with bombs and automatic weapons in Watertown. Serious injuries: New court documents reveal that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had gunshot wounds to his head, face, throat, jaw, left hand and legs when he was captured on April 19 last year (pictured) Despite the assertions of the prosecution, no one else has ever been charged in connection with the bombings. 'In short, the facts and circumstances known to law enforcement at the time they interviewed Tsarnaev provided ample reason to believe that the Tsarnaevs did not act alone,' prosecutors wrote on Wednesday. They also wrote that the government had reason to believe that 'others might have radicalized them, directed them, trained them, assisted them, and/or concealed them; and that these others might be planning or poised to carry out additional attacks. 'Finding out if there were other bombs, other bombers, or others plotting similar and coordinated attacks was a public safety matter of the utmost urgency.' Captured: This frame grab from a video released by the FBI on Thursday, April 18, 2013, shows suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking along Boylston Street in Boston on April 15 . Suspects: This combination of images released by the FBI on Thursday, April 18, 2013, shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan on April 15 on Boylston Street in Boston . This month, lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev argued that the statements . he made to authorities after he was arrested should be thrown out . because he was questioned for 36 hours in a hospital room while . suffering from gunshot wounds and without being told his rights. The lawyers said in a flurry of pre-trial court filings that federal . agents began questioning Tsarnaev about 20 hours after he arrived at the . hospital in critical condition and his statements can't be considered . voluntary. Federal investigators questioned him days after last year's deadly . bombing without formally telling him of his right to a lawyer under a . public safety exception allowed when there's concern about an ongoing . threat. But defense attorneys said the questioning continued 'despite . the fact that he quickly allayed concerns about any continuing threat to . public safety, repeatedly asked for a lawyer, and begged to rest.' They . said his treatment included painkillers that impaired his judgment and . increased his susceptibility to pressure.","The Boston Marathon bombing suspects used sophisticated bombs with fuses made from Christmas lights federal documents released on Wednesday reveal .

"By . Leon Watson . Armed forces at a nuclear missile base failed a drill last summer that simulated the hostile takeover of a missile launch silo because they were too slow, it emerged today. An internal Air Force review revealed the failure happened because security was unable to speedily regain control of the captured nuclear weapon. The previously unreported failure, which the Air Force called a 'critical deficiency,' was the reason the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana flunked its broader safety and security inspection. The underground command console from where the USAF could launch nuclear missiles in the event of war, at the Quebec Launch control center, Montana . The security team was required to respond to the simulated capture of a Minuteman 3 nuclear missile silo, termed an 'Empty Quiver' scenario in which a nuclear weapon is lost, stolen or seized. Each of the Air Force's 450 Minuteman 3 silos contains one missile armed with a nuclear warhead and ready for launch on orders from the president. The review was obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and sought to examine why the security force showed an 'inability to effectively respond to a recapture scenario.' It cited their failure to take 'all lawful actions necessary to immediately regain control of nuclear weapons' but did not specify those actions. The prize for terrorists or others who might seek to seize control of a missile would be the nuclear warhead attached to it. In 2009, the Air Force cited a 'post-9/11 shift in thinking' about such situations, saying that while this nightmare scenario once was considered an impossibility, the U.S. 'no longer has the luxury of assuming what is and what is not possible.' An internal Air Force review has revealed a failure at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana . The frozen plains of Montana as an unusually bitter winter grips the midwest . Captain John Mora, who oversees maintenance crews, exits a ICBM nuclear missile silo after a leak of glycerol (file picture) The inspection failure was one of a string of nuclear missile corps setbacks revealed over the past year. The force has suffered embarrassing leadership and training lapses, breakdowns in discipline and morale problems. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered two parallel nuclear reviews, still underway, to address his concern that these lapses could erode public trust in the security of the nation's nuclear weapons. The safety and security of nuclear weapons under military control is considered of paramount importance, and thus defense agencies perform detailed and rigorous inspections at regular intervals. When the Air Force publicly acknowledged the inspection failure in August, it said 'tactical-level errors' had been committed during one phase of the inspection, but it did not say the errors were made by security forces. At the time, the Air Force declined to provide details, saying to do so could expose potential vulnerabilities. Security forces, safety officers, logistics teams, missile launch crews and others participated in the Malmstrom inspection. Lt Col John Sheets, a spokesman for Air Force Global Strike Command, which is responsible for the nuclear missile corps as well as the nuclear-capable bomber aircraft, said Wednesday he could not comment further. Missile maintenance technicians of the 90th Missile Maintenance Squadron at F.E. Warren Air Force . Base, Wyoming (file picture) A Minuteman III rocket is launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California . 'We cannot divulge additional details of the scenario or the response tactics due to it being sensitive information that could compromise security,' Sheets said. He added that all 'countermeasures,' or corrective actions, that were proposed in the review obtained by the AP have been accomplished. The only exception is a plan for more extensive practicing of security response tactics at launch silos, a move that requires signed agreements with owners of the private land on which the missile silos are situated. The August 5 to 13, 2013, inspection, designed to evaluate management and handling of nuclear weapons to ensure they are properly controlled at all times, was repeated two months later and found no security weaknesses. Security forces are responsible for a range of protective roles on the Air Force's three nuclear missile bases, including along roads used to transport missiles and warheads to and from launch silos; at weapons storage facilities; and at launch silos and launch control centers. The Air Force operates three Minuteman 3 bases — in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming — each with 150 missiles. The partially censored document provided to the AP describes in broad terms the nature of the inspection failure, its significance and its underlying causes. Senior Airmen Mark Pacis, left, and Christopher Carver mount a refurbished nuclear war head on to the top of a Minuteman III missile inside an underground silo in Scottsbluff, Nebraska (file picture) It said insufficient training was at the heart of the problem, beginning with a lack of familiarity among the security forces with 'complex scenario' exercises. It also cited unspecified shortcomings in 'leadership culture' and a lack of standardized simulations not only at Malmstrom but throughout the nuclear missile corps. Among the corrective measures cited in the report: Arrange to hold recapture exercises at one launch silo among the 50 silos in each of the 341st's three Minuteman squadrons, using 'realistic, varied, simple-to-complex' scenarios based on what the Pentagon calls its 'local nuclear security threat capabilities assessment.' Also, the Air Force is taking steps to more closely track lessons learned from each 'recapture' exercise. The Air Force declined to further explain the August exercise scenario, but the document provided to the AP indicates that a security force team was told to recapture a Minuteman 3 missile launch silo within a certain time limit. It did not identify or otherwise describe the team, but each Minuteman 3 missile base has 'tactical response force' teams specially trained and equipped for nuclear weapons recapture and recovery missions. Two years ago, the Air Force promoted these teams as a 'secret weapon' ensuring nuclear security, saying they are provided 'an extensive amount of unique training and are expected to perform flawlessly in whatever scenario thrown their way.' It is not clear from available records precisely what Malmstrom's security forces did wrong or inadequately in the August exercise. A section apparently elaborating on what was meant by the phrase 'failed to take all lawful actions' was removed from the document before its release last week. The Air Force said this information was withheld in accordance with senior-level Pentagon orders 'prohibiting the unauthorized dissemination of unclassified information pertaining to security measures' for the protection of 'special nuclear material.' Labeling the security forces' misstep a 'critical deficiency,' the report said that because security of nuclear weapons is paramount, 'the inability to demonstrate effective recapture/recovery TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) detracts from the Wing's ability to conduct its day-to-day mission.' Colonel Robert Stanley, who was commander of the 341st Wing at the time of the failure, said at the conclusion of the inspection that to publicly reveal details of the results would 'give America's adversaries far too much information about how we operate.' Despite the inspection failure, 'there was no question about our capability to operate safely and with complete confidence,' Stanley said, adding nonetheless that more needed to be done to ensure that 'some very young airmen' understand their responsibilities 'much more clearly.' Nine days later he fired the officer in charge of his security forces, Col. David Lynch, and replaced him temporarily with Colonel John T. Wilcox II. In March, Stanley resigned amid a scandal involving alleged cheating on proficiency tests by up to 100 missile officers at Malmstrom, and the Air Force replaced Stanley with Wilcox. In an interview in January, Stanley suggested there had been disagreement about how the security exercise was conducted during the August inspection. Without providing specifics, he said it was simulated 'in a way that we've never seen before,' adding: 'It confused our airmen. We were off by a matter of seconds.' The 341st has had other security-related problems over the past year. It disciplined two launch control officers who broke security rules on May 31, 2013, by leaving open the blast door to their underground command center when a maintenance person arrived while one of the two crew members was asleep. Compounding the error, the crew commander and his deputy initially lied to their squadron commander in an attempt to hide the violation. The 341st also has at least two missile launch officers under criminal investigation for alleged illegal drug use or possession.","Internal Air Force review showed failure at air force base in Montana .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Two elderly sisters went on a road trip through Eastern Oregon last week, but after getting stuck in a snowdrift and walking for 12 hours for help, only one of the women made it back alive. Stella Adamson, 72, and her sister Sue Blake, 83, both of Vancouver, Washington, were riding in their silver Toyota when they got stranded May 13 on a scenic forest road about 8 miles west of the North Fork Campground in northeast Grant County, Sheriff Glenn Palmer said in a statement. Speaking to the station KPTV, Sue Blake recalled that she and her younger sister tried to dig out their car with every available tool, from their bare hands to plastic cups and even car mats, but the SUV would not budge. Scroll down for video . Final adventure: Sue Blake, 80 (left), survived getting stranded in an Oregon snowdrift and hiking for 12 hours for help, but her 72-year-old sister, Stella Adamson (right), did not make it back alive . Trapped: The sisters' silver Toyota SUV got stuck in the snow on a scenic forest road about 8 miles west of the North Fork Campground in northeast Grant County, Oregon . The women spent the night in the car bundled up in all the clothes they had on hand, then set out at 6am May 14 and walked to the campground for 12 hours. All the women had with them was a plastic water bottle filled with snow to keep them hydrated and a box of Wheat Thins crackers. Adamson fashioned a cane out of a stick she had found to help her walk. Mrs Blake recalled that her sister was in good spirits, and the two even joked how they were two old ladies on a hike. To protect themselves from the sun, the women cut up Blake's T-shirt, soaked the strips of fabric in water and tied them around their heads to stay cool. Picturesque: Blake and Adamson, both avid travelers, were heading to the Painted Hills in Wheeler County . As they slowly made their way to the North Fork Campground, the siblings discussed plans for future trips together. Blake also confided in Adamson that she felt guilty for getting them stranded because she was the one driving, but Adamson pointed out that it was she who decided to take the scenic route through a forest. Upon reaching their destination 12 hours later, they found Robert Nelson and his wife camping. Nelson, of Cove, is a member of the Union County sheriff's search and rescue unit. The couple fed and sheltered the exhausted women, turning the table in their camper into a bed. Nelson said he would try to help them retrieve their car the next day. About 10pm that night, Stella Adamson complained of chest pains, Palmer said. Tragic: Adamson was said to be in good spirits throughout the arduous 8-mile hike to a campground, but soon after she complained of chest pains and died on her way to the hospital . Unable to get a cell phone signal, or contact emergency services with a hand-held radio, Nelson drove the ailing woman to a Baker City hospital, where she was pronounced dead. She would have turned 73 Friday. Nelson later helped Sue Blake retrieve her silver Toyota, the sheriff said. Mrs Blake said that even though her and Adamson's East Oregon adventure ended in tragedy, she was grateful that the two of them had a chance to bond one final time.

Brittney Silva was struck by the Amtrak train as she walked on the tracks at Hesperian Boulevard near her home in San Leandro, California at 5.55pm on Monday. A man had tried to warn her as the train hurtled towards her but she 'did not respond to the witness, possibly . as a result of her not being able to hear him', San Leandro police . Lt. Rick DeCosta said. Her body was found about 50 yards from the track, with her pink phone nearby. Tragedy: Brittney Silva, 18, died on Monday night after being struck by a train.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Nearly a year to the day after Long Island college student Andrea Rebello was accidentally killed by police during a hostage crisis, her twin sister Jessica ascended the stage at Hofstra University Sunday to accept her diploma wearing a cap honoring the slain woman. Just hours before Sunday’s graduation ceremony, Jessica Rebello, 22, shared a snapshot of her homemade tribute on her Instagram account, showing the top of the graduation cap with her sister's purple initials, ‘AR,’ with a pair of white wings sprouting from the sides of the letters, a golden halo crowing the ‘A’ and a pair of hearts. Beneath the initials, Jessica laid out the name of their sorority, Beta Sigma Phi, and wrote on the other side of the mortarboard: 'always & forever.' Touching tribute: Jessica Rebello shared a photo on her Instagram showing her graduation cap decorated with the initially of her sister, Andrea, who was accidentally shot by police a year ago . Bittersweet moment: Jessica Rebello took the stage at Hofstra University and got a kiss on the cheek from President Stuart Rabinowitz before accepting her diploma a day after the one-year anniversary of her sister's killing . Momentous occasion: Ms Rebello was on hand for the commencement ceremony Sunday, graduating with a bachelor's degree in public relations . Ms Rebello accompanied the picture by the following caption: 'I don't know how I did it... but I did it... for you- ilu &miss you, always &forever... until we meet again Twinnie...' In the early hours of May 17, 2013, Andrea Rebello was in her Uniondale home, which she shared with her sister and two other roommates, when 30-year-old Dalton Smith, a convicted felon wanted for violating the conditions of his parole, forced his way in looking for money and got the 21-year-old in a chokehold. One of two Nassau County police officers who responded to the hostage situation heard Smith repeating the words, 'I'm going to kill her,' and then saw him pointing his 9mm gun at the cops. Joint at the hip: Andrea Rebello, pictured here, left, next to twin sister Jessica, was shot in the head May 17, 2013, in the Uniondale home the twins shared with two other roommates . Crisis: Dalton, Smith, 30 (left), a convicted felon, was fatally shot by police seven times while holding Andrea Rebello (right) in a choke-hold, but the eight bullet struck the hostage in the head . Crime scene: The Nassau County prosecutor ruled last month that the responding officer had no choice but to use deadly force in response to the home invasion in Uniondale . The officer, Nikolas Budimlic, opened fire striking the intruder seven times, but the eighth bullet hit Andrea Rebello in the head, killing her on the spot. On Sunday, one day after the first anniversary of her twin sister's killing, Jessica Rebello graduated with a bachelor's degree in public relations from Hofstra’s Lawrence Herbert School of Communication, when Andrea studied as well, Newsday reported. On her way to receive her diploma, Jessica was greeted by Hofstra President Stuart Rabinowitz, who exchanged a few quiet words with her and gave her a kiss on the cheek. Rebello's faculty adviser also gave the graduate a hug. Legal action: The twins' family filed a wrongful death lawsuit last week against Nassau County and its police force . The commencement ceremony came just days after the Rebello family filed a wrongful- death lawsuit against Nassau County and its police department, claiming that Officer Budimlic 'carelessly discharged his pistol' and 'recklessly and unnecessarily endangered' Andrea's life. The county prosecutor ruled last month that officer Nikolas Budimlic, an eight-year veteran of Nassau police, had no option but deadly force on the armed convicted felon. District Attorney Kathleen Rice concluded the 21-year-old Rebello's death was caused by a gunman breaking into her Hempstead residence with a gun, taking several residents hostage and refusing to surrender to police. Officer Budimlic ‘acted accordingly’ when he opened fire, killing not only the armed suspect but 21-year-old Andrea Rebello in May 2013, at an off-campus New York house, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office announced Wednesday following an 11-month investigation.","Jessica Rebello, 22, graduated Sunday from Hofstra University's Lawrence Herbert School of Communication with BA in public relations .

The principal of a Catholic elementary school in suburban Philadelphia is apologizing to parents for having used a photo of Ellen DeGeneres on an invitation to an Oscars-themed graduation dance.

The principal of a Catholic school in Bucks County apologized to parents on Tuesday for using a photo of Ellen DeGeneres on an invitation to an Oscars-themed graduation dance, and is demanding students return them to be destroyed . DeGeneres came out as gay in 1997 and married actress Portia de Rossi in 2008. 'A role model, as defined by Webster's Dictionary, is a person who is unusually effective or inspiring in some social role, job, position, etc,' the email said. 'This does not describe her at all. We work so hard to be good role models and then I go and do something stupid!' Principal Nancy Matteo said in a letter that using the picture of Ellen was 'completely wrong' DeGeneres hosted the Oscars in 2007 and 2014. The image on the invitation for the June 8 dance shows her holding an Oscar statue accompanied by the phrase 'Live from the red carpet.' Matteo, who declined to comment on the email to Philly.com, said in the email that she was 'obviously NOT thinking' when she included the photo. She asked that the invitations be returned so she can destroy them and distribute new ones. Spokesman Ken Gavin of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia said the Bucks County principal apologized of her own accord after parents questioned the photo. He said Catholic schools are 'firmly rooted in Gospel-based values and the teachings of the Church' and any promotional materials developed by the schools are expected to 'feature images and themes that correspond with their core mission and identity'.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Earlier this week, it emerged that Kim Kardashian - who usually has no problem sharing intimate details of her life, and her bottom, with the digital world - has reportedly banned the use of social media at her wedding to fiance Kanye West this weekend. But according to a new survey conducted by David's Bridal, it seems most brides-to-be consider this embargo to be a little excessive, with only 14 per cent of U.S. brides planning to completely ban the use of social media on their wedding days. Of those questioned, almost half of the . brides-to-be agreed that regardless of their own stance, setting . 'digital rules' ahead of their nuptials is an important consideration. Banned?  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West (pictured this morning in Paris) may be forbidding guests from using social media at their wedding - but a new study has found that only 14 per cent of brides-to-be will do the same . Fifty-eight per cent believe the bride and groom should be the first to post a photo, and 62 per cent agreed that bridesmaids should not post any photos of the bride in her dress ahead of the ceremony - which seems obvious enough. A minority of those questioned, only 26 per cent, say they were likely to encourage a specially-created hashtag to amalgamate the avid postings of their guests, a method employed by Big Bang star Kaley Cuoco at her wedding. Ms Cuoco, who married husband Ryan . Sweeting on New Year's Eve, created the #thesweetings hashtag, and the . first wedding photo she shared garnered more than 48,000 'likes' from . her fans. Failed attempt: Chloe Delevingne (left) originally claimed her sister Poppy (center) was banning guests from 'posting pictures' at her high society wedding, but the bride herself and countless guests shared inside snaps anyway . Intimate details: Supermodel Cara Delevingne managed to mostly keep a lid on it at the wedding last weekend, but for this snap (pictured) which she shared with her five million-strong pack of Instagram followers . And as people all over the planet rely more and more on social media to keep in touch with their loved ones from afar, 36 per cent of brides surveyed said that live-streaming their nuptials or integrating Skype would be 'a nice touch' for those who can't make it for the big occasion. How does long does it take for newly married brides to change their 'status' on social media? For a majority of them, not very long. Fifty-six per cent of brides will adopt their new married names on social media the very same day of the wedding. For all to see: Actress Kaley Cuoco (pictured with new husband Ryan Sweeting) created the hashtag #thesweetings to bring all the social media postings together on her wedding, like this photo shared by Kaley's 'dog' on Instagram . Hush Hush: Some celebrity couples, including Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford (left) and Leighton Meester and Adam Brody (right) kept their weddings so off the grid, many didn't even know they were married for weeks . According to The Daily Star, . the reality TV star is issuing a contract than 'bans guests from . uploading anything on social media, taking pictures and even talking . about the big day with friends and family who weren’t invited to the . wedding.' It will interesting to see whether the couple Mr West will be able to contain their over-sharing urges on their big day, as they have apparently planned. British model and socialite Poppy Delevingne, who married her long-time partner James Cook over the weekend, were said to be implicating the same ban. 'Poppy and James want it to be private, and no one can post any pictures,' the brides older sister, Chloe Delevingne, informed MailOnline before the wedding. That rule was clearly an epic failure, with Poppy herself, her supermodel sister Cara Delevingne, and pretty much the rest of the wedding party uploading photos throughout the day. Some stars on the other hand have kept themselves so unplugged, Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford or Leighton Meister and Adam Brody for example, that it was weeks before anyone even knew they had married. For most of us however, megawatt celebrity or otherwise, the simple truth is that it's near impossible to escape the presence of social media, especially on one of the most important days of your life.","A new study by David's Bridal has revealed that only 14 per cent of U.S. brides-to-be plan to forbid the use of social media at their weddings .
Fifty-eight per cent believe the bride and groom should be first to post a wedding photo .
Over half of brides will adopt their new married names on social media within a day of the nuptials ."
"By . Ashley Collman . A baby deer is alive today thanks to the quick thinking of a landscaper and his handy box-cutter. Bill Schulte was driving home from church through Prior Lake, Minnesota on Sunday when he saw a doe get hit by a car. He pulled over to the side of the road to check on the deer and saw that it was too late. However, he noticed a movement in the deer's abdomen and realized the female was pregnant. Scroll down for video . A newborn fawn that has been nicknamed Bambi was born in an emergency c-section by a landscaper who witnessed its mother's death while driving . Quick thinking: Bill Schulte noticed the deer was pregnant and decided to try to save the unborn fawn by using his landscaping box cutter to free the baby . 'I was like, oh, she's gone, but the baby's in there kicking. I've got to do something,' Mr Schulte told WCCO. So he took out his retractable box cutter he uses in his job as a landscaper and worked quickly to free the unborn fawn. 'It was just nice to see how he came right out nice and smooth,' Mr Schulte said, 'and I just worked the neck, because his neck came out first.' Newborn: Mr Schulte was surprised by how easy the baby deer came out . Life begins: Above, the first picture of the newborn fawn just minutes after birth . Rescued: Mr Schulte took pictures of the newborn fawn just after the emergency c-section on Sunday . Mr Schulte then drove 30 minutes to deliver the baby fawn to a wildlife rehabilitator . After the fawn's lucky birth, Mr Schulte drove 30 minutes to a wildlife rehabilitation center in Roseville where he entrusted the newborn in the care of Polly Rixe, a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. In just a few days the fawn has already growing fast and is already walking. 'My daughter calls it Bambi,' Ms Rixe told KSTP. 'We don't normally name our deer but right away she said this is Bambi.' Named: The rescued fawn has been nicknamed Bambi by Polly Rixe and her family . Growing fast: Bambi has started walking and is being kept in a playpen with two other rescued fawns . Ms Rixe says it will take most of the summer to get Bambi ready for the wild, but the fawn is already working towards that goal with its first visit outside earlier this week. 'It’s kind of crazy,' Rixe said. 'I wouldn’t necessarily promote people doing that, but I guess for this particular fawn, it’s a happy ending.' As for Mr Schulte, he thinks he was meant to save Bambi. Twenty years ago, he was involved in a car accident that sent him into a coma for two weeks. 'The good lord didn't need me up there yet and wanted me to accomplish things down here and this must have been one of them,' he said. First steps: Bambi started walking outside this week. The fawn's training to re-enter the wild will take all summer . In good hands: Little Bambi guzzles down a bottle of milk .","Bill Schulte saw a pregnant deer get hit by a car on the way home from church on Sunday .

"By . Associated Press . A Texan calf named Hero has become was is likely the nation's only . double-amputee with prosthetics after a new . pair of high-tech devices attached to its back legs. Hot and tired from a three-hour drive . inside a trailer behind a pickup truck, the 600-pound English Charolais . calf was content to lay on the grass behind a south Houston building . while a team of technicians worked on its hind legs. When the calf known as Hero heard its name called, the 15-month-old gingerly got up, unsteadily rocked a bit, then waddled away, tail wagging, eyes wide and tongue licking. It headed across a patch of concrete toward an appetizing snack of green shrubbery a few yards away. Four-legs good! Wearing his new prosthetic legs Hero gets a taste of shrubbery in Houston . Luckily talented veterinarians were able to give Hero a set of hind legs . Hero the calf wouldn't have been alive had it not been for the love and care from those around him . 'I'm so proud,' Hero's caretaker, Kitty Martin, exclaimed. 'Look at you!' It's the latest step in a year-long effort that has taken Martin and the animal from Virginia, where she rescued it last year from an Augusta County farm where it succumbed to frostbite that claimed its hooves, to Texas. Animal surgeons at Texas A&M University treated Hero for several months and affixed the initial prosthetics that the calf now had outgrown. 'This is our first cow,' Erin O'Brien, an orthotist and prosthetist for Hanger Inc., an Austin-based national firm that makes prosthetic limbs. She was among a team of about eight people working on the project for about two weeks. 'We did a lot of study of photos and video of cows just regular walking to see what it looks like and see if we can mimic that biomechanically,' O'Brien said. 'It's unusual, yes, but an opportunity.' That loving feeling: Kitty Martin, right, snuggles Hero after he was fitted with new prosthetic legs. Martin rescued the abandoned calf from a Virginia farm a year ago, brought him to Texas and got him permanent prosthetics to replace back hooves that had to be amputated because of frostbite . Kitty says she loves Hero more than any other animal she has ever met . Kitty says she is excited for Hero to work with handicapped children and wounded veterans because she feels Hero will be an inspiration to them . Surgeons at Texas A&M accepted Martin's initial pleas for help, removing about two inches of bone to enable them to create a pad of tissue that would allow for prosthetics. 'Until I worked on him, I hadn't ever done it before. And I'd not heard of (prosthetics) before in a bovine,"" said Ashlee Watts, an equine orthopedic surgeon at the school. Martin figures she has spent nearly $40,000 to save the calf. 'I don't know how to explain it,' she said. 'I'm an animal rescuer. And he had everything against him.' Hero's hooves are custom made of urethane and titanium, the connecting components are titanium and carbon fiber and the sockets that attach to his legs are carbon fiber and acrylic resin. Back on his feet: Hero is fitted with new prosthetic legs. He was found freezing to death in a Virginia field and is now back on the move . Hero the calf was discovered with frostbite so severe that he had to have his hind legs amputated . Martin and O'Brien declined to discuss the cost, but estimated that similar devices for humans go for between $4,000 and $8,000 apiece. Hero's sockets are painted with black and white cow spots. ""Holstein legs,"" O'Brien laughed. 'We like to customize legs to the person's personality,' she said. Martin, 53, a former veterinary technician and retired truck driver originally from Dalhart, in the Texas Panhandle, is moving with her husband from Greenville, Virginia, to Cameron in Central Texas. She's hoping Hero, who could grow to 1,500 pounds, can be a therapy animal for wounded veterans and special needs children. 'It makes my day,' Martin said. 'He's got a very bright future right now.'","Hero the calf suffered from frostbite after being abandoned in April 2013 and had to have his hooves amputated .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain will hold peace talks with Yaya Toure before the World Cup in an attempt to head off further trouble with the Ivory Coast midfielder. Toure’s agent Dimitry Seluk attracted widespread ridicule on Tuesday by claiming that the player could quit City this summer because he felt the new Premier League champions and their owner Sheik Mansour did not make enough of an effort to celebrate his 31st birthday during a post-season trip to Abu Dhabi last week. There are concerns that Seluk is trying to engineer a return to Barcelona for his client, who left the Nou Camp in a £24million deal in 2010 and has since established himself as one of City’s best  players, as well as one of the best paid. On the floor: Yaya Toure has sparked a row at Manchester City amid claims the club snubbed his birthday . Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk said there is a 'big possibility' the midfielder will leave the Etihad . All smiles: Toure is now training in America with the Ivory Coast after his trip to Abu Dhabi with City . Toure scored 24 goals from 49 appearances last season as Manuel Pellegrini’s side regained the title and lifted the Capital One Cup. City have taken a firm stance by insisting Toure will not be sold as he still has three years left on a £200,000-a-week contract signed 12 months ago. However, they want to maintain a conciliatory approach and are anxious not to let the problem escalate following claims from Toure that he will issue a statement after the World Cup. Begiristain was already planning to be in Brazil for the tournament but his priority will now be to set up talks with the player to smooth things over. Toure arrived in Dallas from Qatar on Wednesday with the rest of the Ivory Coast squad to prepare for warm-up games against Bosnia and El Salvador. It is understood that City will counter . accusations by Seluk that they have treated Toure ‘like a nobody’ and . showed him no respect by reminding the player how he was given a . lucrative new deal last year after more bizarre claims that he wanted to . leave because there were not enough shirts bearing his name on sale in . the club shop. Peacemaker: Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain will talk with Toure before the World Cup . Top of the pops: Toure stands proudly with manager Manuel Pellegrini after sealing the Premier League title . Slice it up: Toure did get a birthday cake, pictured here, on the plane to their post-season tour . £47million - Since making his big-money move to Barcelona in 2007, Yaya Toure has earned approximately £47m in wages alone. That includes contracts of around £40,000-a-week at Barcelona and a weekly wage of more than £200,000 at City. PS . It’s not just wages that Yaya pockets - in his time at City the midfielder has earned around £6m in image rights and £4m in bonuses. City also fought his case when he was subjected to racist abuse from CSKA Moscow fans in October, and lobbied for him to be named Player of the Year ahead of Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, who won the award. Begiristain hopes to have more time on his hands in Brazil because City are confident that all their transfer business will be wrapped up before the tournament after chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak promised ‘an efficient and swift execution plan’. They retain a strong interest in Eliaquim Mangala having failed to sign the FC Porto centre back before the transfer window closed in January. But they are growing concerned that the £35m-rated defender is dragging his feet after claiming that he would prefer to join Chelsea. It is understood that City have two stand-by options, one of whom is Mehdi Benatia from Roma. Target: City are keen on a summer move for Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala .","Toure is upset that the club did not celebrate his 31st birthday appropriately .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A Tory former policing minister was slammed today after using the word 'f*ckwit' on live TV today. Nick Herbrert used the foul slur while criticising the response to Home Secretary Theresa May's attack on the way ordinary police officers treated the public. Mrs May had accused PCs of treating the public with 'contempt' and threatened to overhaul the way they ran themselves if they did not sort themselves out. Her controversial speech to the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth yesterday sparked a furious response from rank and file officers. But Mr Herbert slammed the police's reaction and accused one senior former policeman of using the foul term to describe Mrs May. Nick Herbert sparked controversy after swearing on the BBC's Daily Politics TV show. Presenter Jo Coburn was forced to apologise for his behaviour and warn him not to repeat the slur. Mr Herbert MP was defending Theresa May's  speech to the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth when he quoted a vile attack on the Home Secretary by a senior former detective . After using the word  on the BBC's live Daily Politics programme, hosted by Andrew Neil, Mr Herbert was inundated with complaints and the BBC was forced to apologised for the remark. The Conservative MP was criticising some police officers’ 'infantile' response to the Home Secretary's speech yesterday.. He said: 'I am afraid there have been a minority who have been outspoken and they are very active on twitter and I saw Peter [Kirkham – former detective chief inspector] himself yesterday described the Home Secretary as a ‘f*ckwit’ in his own twitter line. 'Indeed we should not have any more of it from either police officers or former police officers - this kind of infantile discussion that goes on. What we need is a serious discussion about how policing has got to adapt to today’s age and the things that need to be done to sort out the problems that we have seen.' He later defended his actions and pointed out that he used the term 'disapprovingly'. But presenter Jo Coburn interrupted Mr Herbert, telling him 'we won't have any more of that' and cautioning him to speak 'without repeating any of those expletives'. Mr Herbert responded: 'Indeed we should not have any more of it, from either police officers or former police officers, this kind of infantile discussion that goes on.' The Home Secretary launched a furious assault on the police yesterday - accusing them of treating the public with 'contempt' At the end of the programme Ms Coburn offered a full apology for the outburst, saying it was unacceptable and would not be repeated. Explaining his actions on Twitter following the broadcast, Mr Herbert said: 'Shame on the former police officer on the prog who used the word to describe the Home Sec and who I was quoting disapprovingly.' A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Daily Politics is a live programme and, as with any live broadcast, occasionally slip-ups may happen. We apologised to viewers immediately for any offence caused.' A number of people expressed their disapproval on Twitter that such language was used on a daytime political discussion. Mr Kirkham later appeared to dispute having used the term, posting a message which said: 'Genuinely don't recall doing so 'a couple of days ago'!' Labour MP Liz Kendall was among those to condemn the bad language, saying on Twitter: 'My dad is constituent of Nick Herbert. Very unhappy at reports of his comments on Daily Politics. Completely inappropriate, especially for an MP.' Greater Manchester Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy pleader for a truce in the war of words between Theresa May and the police . Mr Herbert was attacking the Police Federation's response to Mrs May's brutal assault on their record. He said the organisation, which represents rank and file officers, had been a 'terrible advert' for British policing and welcomed, what he described as, their reluctant acceptance of the changes proposed at conference. 'I think there is this continuing problem that there is an element within the Police Federation that hasn’t understood the importance of policing needing to change and the Federation itself needing to change. 'The Federation has been a terrible advert for policing; the behaviour of its members during the conferences, which has been often boorish even drunken; the way in which they refuse to embrace any kind of discussion about the police service, has to do with a lot of the problems that it has confronted. 'There have been string of problems and they have got to be addressed. The Home Secretary listed all of those. It’s not representative, it’s not diverse, there are very few women there, there are certainly almost no black and minority ethnic police officers there. It’s a really bad advert for British policing and it has to change and it’s not just me saying that. 'There has been this report, led by David Normington commissioned by the federation itself that listed all the ways in which the Federation was not fit for purpose and needed to change and pointed out that it does not enjoy the confidence of the overwhelming majority of its own members. 'I am very pleased that finally the Federation did, yesterday, vote for change. It was opposed by the Metropolitan Police Federation, which was a quarter of all policing. So I am afraid there are elements which don’t understand, that live in this Jurassic Park world of policing in a different age and I’m afraid it’s got to change.'","Former minister attacks police reaction to Home Secretary's speech .

"By . Amanda Williams . A heartbreaking suicide pact taken in 1915 between a soldier and his wife so they could avoid the horrors of the First World War has been discovered in archives. Shadrach Critchley, 35, and his wife Annie, 45, were found lying side by side on a mattress at their home in Leigh, Greater Manchester, on Monday May 24, 1915 - shortly after Mr Critchley was recruited to the Cheshire Regiment. A newspaper cutting from the time reveals that alongside the couple were two handwritten notes, expressing their wish 'never to be parted'. Shadrach Critchley, 35, and his wife Annie, 45, were found lying side by side on a mattress at their home in Leigh, Greater Manchester, on Monday May 24 1915 - shortly after Mr Critchley was recruited to the army . The tale was uncovered by volunteer historian and genealogist Susan Berry, 50, who came across the incident during her research. Ms Berry, from Leigh, said: 'When most people think of World War One they tend to think of men dying on the front line or from injuries received in combat, but Shadrach’s and his wife’s deaths were also a direct result of the war. 'I’m not sure what people’s attitudes would have been like at the time towards events like these. 'The story made me think about what people must have been going through emotionally when the men went off to war.' Born in 1881, Mr Critchley was brought up in Leigh and followed his father Thomas down the pit, working as a coal miner. He married Annie Heaton in 1906 and the census five years later suggests they lived in Westleigh, Greater Manchester, and did not have any children. Mr Critchley is listed in the local newspaper in April 1915 as a new recruit to the Army and was stationed at Birkenhead, but returned home on May 22 for three days’ leave. The sad tale was uncovered by volunteer historian and genealogist Susan Berry, 50, who came across the incident during her research . According to friend and fellow soldier Richard Adamson, he was at the Fleece Inn the night before he was due to rejoin his regiment, telling him he had made a mistake in enlisting in the forces. Mr Adamson said he had tried to reassure him it would be fine but when he went to the Critchleys’ house the following evening, he forced open the door and found both Shadrach and Annie on a mattress on the kitchen floor. An inquest heard the couple had written notes expressing their wish not to be parted, and were buried together in St Paul’s churchyard in Westleigh. At the inquest, the jury, who heard evidence concerning their deaths, recorded a verdict of temporary insanity. Mr Critchley’s name was finally given posthumous recognition when he was placed on the Brookwood Memorial, in a list of around 500 men who died on British shores. Mr Critchley is listed in the local newspaper in April 1915 as a new recruit to the Army and was stationed at Birkenhead, but returned home on May 22 for three days' leave . The memorial, located in Surrey alongside a huge cemetery containing the final resting place of more than 1,500 Commonwealth servicemen who died in the UK of their wounds, was erected in 2004, almost 90 years after Shadrach’s death. Hannah Turner, local and family history officer at Leigh Local Studies, said: 'It’s a very sad story and one we had never come across before. 'It shows that the deaths during the war didn’t just happen on the battlefield.'","Shadrach Critchley, 35, and his wife Annie, 45, were found lying side by side .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A holidaymaker who was delayed for more than 27 hours is taking on the aviation industry in a landmark case which could pave the way for millions of compensation claims against airline giants. Ron Huzar, 58, from Offerton, Stockport, started legal action against airline Jet2 after his flight from Manchester . to Malaga was severely delayed in October 2011 due to a wiring defect. But despite Mr Huzar claiming that the delay was within the airline's control, Jet2 has refused to pay up - and instead took Mr Huzar's claim all the way to the High Court. Ron Huzar, 58, from Offerton, Stockport, brought legal action against . airline company Jet2 after his flight to Malaga from Manchester was . delayed by 27 hours - but it refused to pay up . Now Mr Huzar is waiting to see whether the court sides with his argument, in a case which experts claim could affect the 'entire airline industry'. Mr Huzar said: 'This is going to become a much bigger issue because I believe they have been getting away with it.' If the ruling is made in Mr Huzar's favour, experts warn it could open the floodgates for complaints from up to 2.6million delayed customers a year . Mr Huzar, a company director, decided to sue the airline after he waited for more than a day for his flight with his wife and 12-year-old granddaughter. The father-of-three issued legal proceedings but his compensation claim was turned down at Stockport County Court. Mr Huzar refused to give up and successfully appealed the decision at Manchester County Court. But Jet2 also lodged an appeal, citing 'ambiguity' in EU regulations for why it was avoiding paying out the compensation. Jet2 has blamed the lack of 'clarity' in EU regulations for why it has not paid any compensation to Mr Huzar. A decision in Mr Huzar's favour would rule out a 'technical difficulty' as a circumstance beyond the airline's control . Now, the case is due to be heard at the High Court - the highest court at which the case can be dealt with in this country. Current regulations allow passengers to claim compensation if a flight is delayed by more than three hours. The only time that is not allowed is if the delay is caused by an ‘extraordinary circumstance’. The . delay to the Manchester-bound flight was caused by a wiring defect in a . fuel valve circuit, which Mr Huzar claims is not 'extraordinary'. Mr . Huzar said technical faults were ‘inherent in the running of an . aircraft’ and should therefore be considered as within the airline's . control. It means the case is key because it will rule out a 'technical defect' as an extraordinary circumstance. Mr Huzar said: 'It was a total disaster from start to finish. 'Airlines are using the extraordinary circumstances argument to avoid paying out compensation.' Kevin Clarke, an aviation lawyer at Bott & Co in Wilmslow, said the judgment would ‘set a binding precedent'. Regulation (EC) 261/2004 requires airlines compensate passengers if their flight is cancelled or delayed. Initially, the regulation only covered cancelled flights, but a European Court of Justice ruling in 2009 said it could apply to any delays of more than three hours. The rules can apply to any person leaving on a flight from an EU airport, or anyone arriving at an EU airport on an EU airline. Customers can also claim back for flights which were delayed up to six years ago. But the delay has to be a minimum of three hours. Customers are also only entitled to compensation if the delay was deemed to have been within the airline's control. It cannot be what is called 'extraordinary circumstances'. The regulation does not give precise examples of what these extraordinary circumstances are but staff shortage and aircraft unavailability is deemed to be within the airline control. Bad weather or an 'Act of God' is not deemed to be. A technical difficulty has proved to be a grey area, with some rejected by an airline and others not. The compensation is for the delay, not for the cost of the price ticket. It means the refund will be a standard figure, regardless of how much the ticket cost. He argued that the extraordinary circumstances clause was for events like the volcanic ash cloud crisis of 2010. He said: 'The airlines are insisting on twisting what should be a very straightforward point of law. 'In Germany and Holland there have been thousands of cases settled over this very issue. 'It is widely accepted there that a technical defect is not an extraordinary circumstance under the terms of the regulation. 'This is just another instance of the airlines dragging their heels, using every excuse not to pay out to consumers.' A Jet2 spokesman said: 'As EU legislation on passenger rights currently stands, neither customers nor the airline industry have clarity on the situation. 'We regret this ambiguity, which has caused so much confusion for travellers. 'This case, which could have a significant impact on the entire airline industry, shows that there are no easy answers. 'That’s why we are appealing the judge’s decision and are supporting the ongoing review of EC 261 to make the air travel rules fairer, clearer, and simpler to apply. 'Jet2.com’s focus is always on providing high levels of service at great prices and we take complaints very seriously. 'When unprecedented disruptions do occur, our priority is to make sure our customers reach their destination as soon as possible.' For a three-hour flight of up to 150km, the compensation is generally expected to be £220. For up to 3,500km, the refund would generally be expected to be £350.","Ron Huzar, 58, delayed for 27 hours when flying from Manchester to Malaga .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Richard Spillett . Not even a bouquet of flowers and a balloon could raise a smile from White Dee today just hours after learning her sickness benefits are apparently going to be cut. The Department for Work and Pensions has reportedly frozen the reality TV star's £101 a week sickness benefit after she started cashing in on her growing celebrity status. The Channel 4 Benefits Street star angered taxpayers recently when she was pictured on a jolly to Magaluf where she was she seen downing pints, shots and champagne. A . neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I don't know if someone . ordered the flowers to her house or what they were for, but she said . thanks and that was that. 'She didn't seem happy at all, just looked quite down and I am not surprised after hearing her benefits had been cut.' Scroll down for video . Cheer up Dee! Despite receiving a bouquet of flowers and a balloon on her doorstep today, White Dee looked glum after learning that her benefits 'have been frozen' The 42-year-old had defiantly insisted ‘I’m not doing anything wrong’ and . said she would continue taking state handouts until the Prime Minister . or the Government stops her. The mother-of-two, real name Deirdre Kelly, has repeatedly claimed that she is too depressed to work and her Magaluf trip was a pick-me-up for which she was not paid. But, according to The Sun, her Employment and Support Allowance has now been cut by the DWP, who could investigate her to see whether she has stuck to the rules. Not even a mystery bouquet of flowers and a balloon could raise a smile from Miss Kelly today just hours after learning of the apparent decision. Her representative Barry Tomes insists all her work has been properly declared to the authorities. He refused to confirm whether her benefits have been cut but accused the DWP of being 'inefficient and ineffective' in dealing with her changing circumstances. He told MailOnline: 'I have been in communication with the benefits agency since February when I first took her on, my last communication with them was on May 13. We have not heard anything back from them in all that time. 'Miss Kelly remains available to meet with the job centre team as we have previously told them. They have declined.' Mr Tomes said it was possible Miss Kelly's benefits had been cut temporarily due to her income rising from one-off media appearances, but the state payments could resume if her earnings drop again. Jaunt: White Dee during her recent trip to Magaluf. She said the shots she was seen downing were water . Back to earth: Dee returning to her home on James Turner Street, Birmingham after her holiday last month . But Mr Tomes threatened legal action against the government if it emerges the DWP has released any of Ms Kelly's personal details to the media. He said: 'If we can prove that a public, government department have leaked documents about Dee then we will use the full weight of the law against them because that would be outrageous.' After Dee appeared at her front door to recieve some gifts yesterday, a neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I don't know if someone ordered the flowers to her house or what they were for, but she said thanks and that was that. Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) offers financial help for those unable to work due to disability or long-term illness. Claimants have to undergo an assessment to see the extent of their disability and how it affects their ability to work. Those whose disability is not severe have to attend regular interviews with an adviser, but those severely affected are not required to attend. How much claimants get is determined by their circumstances, but the normal rate is up to £108.15 a week, according the Department of Work and Pensions. Miss Kelly's agent has previously said her depression is regularly reviewed by her doctor, who was consulted about her trips abroad. 'She didn’t seem happy at all, just looked quite down. I am not surprised after hearing her benefits had been cut. 'Now she really does look depressed but everyone agrees its only fair judging on what she’s been doing.' Miss Kelly, . whose handouts equate to the take-home pay of someone earning £20,000 a . year, was getting £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance – . formerly known as Sickness Benefit – Child Tax Credit and Child . Benefit, plus £500 a month Housing Benefit. But she was recently pictured partying in Magaluf in Majorca and enjoying a steak dinner . at a top restaurant. ‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said. Her . last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – . and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000.

"By . Richard Spillett . A shameless father is facing jail after he claimed almost £50,000 in child benefits for 11 years after his daughter died. Jem Bakalej, 56, swindled thousands of pounds of taxpayers' cash in the decade-long scam, in which he pretended to be the single parent of Grace, who tragically passed away in 2001. A court heard that between June 2001 and November 2012 he pocketed a total of £49,000 in state handouts for his daughter. Jem Bakalej claimed £50,000 worth of benefits for 11 years, telling authorities he was a single parent, despite his daughter having tragically died a month after her birth . Prosecutor Richard Dewsbury said Bakalej made a claim for benefits as a single parent of Grace - who was born prematurely on June 16, 2001. But the child was actually living with her mother in Northampton and tragically died a month after her birth, on July 21, 2001. At Northampton Crown Court last week, Bakalej pleaded guilty to three counts of cheating the public revenue. Judge Lynn Tayton told him to expect a jail term when he is sentenced next week. The court heard Bakalej also applied to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in March 2002 for income support as a lone parent of Grace, eight months after his daughter died. He continued to claim income support until November 2010, stealing a total of £35,359.64 from the taxpayer. Bakalej actually lived away from the baby girl during her short life and had three children with another partner, who claimed benefits for them as well, a court heard . Bakalej also claimed child tax credits as a lone parent of Grace after August 2010, worth a total of £6,806.21. As a result of his false statements he also received £6,826 in child benefit, which he claimed until March 2011. Mr Dewsbury told the court: 'The child benefit should have ceased to have been paid the first Monday after the child’s death in July 2001. 'But he failed to inform Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs about Grace's death, and payments continued until 2011.' The 56-year-old continued with the scam until he was exposed by authorities, who he told he needed the money . Mr Dewsbury added: 'They only ceased when he failed to respond to enquiries from HMRC.' Bakalej lived with his partner in Northampton and she also received child benefit for their other three children, the court heard. When interviewed by police in November 2012, Bakalej told officers he had continued to claim for his dead daughter because he 'needed the money'. He admitted he knew it would get him a higher income and accepted that he was being greedy. The court heard Bakalej had also applied for Social Fund Loans in 2005, 2006 and 2007 using his late daughter’s details. Bakalej was told to expect a prison term when he is sentenced at Northampton Crown Court next week . The court heard he has not worked since 2000 and is repaying the money back at £120 a month - which will take him 34 years to do. The case was today adjourned until next Friday after the judge said she wanted to hear more evidence regarding Bakalej's child support arrangements. Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said afterwards: 'This sad case again highlights what a complete mess our benefits system is. 'The welfare system is a safety net for the those who really need it; benefit fraudsters not only leave taxpayers unfairly out of pocket but they also take away from the most vulnerable in our society. 'There should be much better checks in place to stop people taking advantage of the system, along with strong penalties when someone's caught out, not just a slap on the wrist.'","Jem Bakalej claimed for daughter Grace despite her living away from him .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Two fisherman who were feared drowned after being missing at sea for more than two days have been found - after managing to survive on just two biscuits and a litre of water. Jim Reid, 75, and his grandson David Irvine, 35, were reported missing after failing to return to Gourdon Harbour, Scotland, after lobster fishing on Tuesday morning. Three lifeboats, a trio of search and rescue helicopters and several commercial crafts scoured the area for signs of life, but the search was called off late last night after a fruitless 48 hours. All smiles: James Reid, 75, right, and his grandson David Irvine, 35, . left, were found in the North Sea by a passing fishing vessel after . being missing at sea for two days . The men were rescued from the 16ft creel boat Water Rail, pictured above, by fishing vessel Sylvia Bowers, which stumbled across the boat as it was travelling from Buckie, Moray . The two men were later taken to shore on a lifeboat to Montrose, where their families waited for their arrival . The pair, who were feared dead by their families, said they ran the . boat's engine to keep them warm and 'never gave up hope' they would be found, despite having just two biscuits and one litre of water between them . But at 7.45am this morning, the 16ft creel boat was spotted by a passing fishing vessel, 46 miles off the coast of Montrose, north east Scotland - with both men still alive. The men, from Inverbervie, have now arrived back at the harbour in Montrose, where they had an emotional reunion with their families. Mr Irvine said: 'The compass just sent us in the wrong direction and we ended up lost in the fog- we must have set it wrongly. 'We just had no idea where we were.' The fishermen were found 46 miles off the coast of Montrose, north east Scotland, in the middle of the North Sea, pictured above. Gourdon Bay Harbour, from where the duo set off, is shown above . The 50-hour ordeal began when the fishermen became lost in heavy fog after the compass broke on board the boat. But despite rough seas and cold temperatures, Mr Reid said the pair 'never gave up hope' they would be found - even though they had just two litres of fuel left in the tank when they were rescued. He said: 'We had two biscuits and a litre and a half of water, but we ate the biscuits on the first night. 'After the first day we began sipping the water to make it last. David must be about two stones lighter now. 'It . wasn't too bad when we first went out but the fog started to come in . pretty thick. Because of the fog on the first night we got completely . lost. The search for the boat had been called off late last night - just hours before the men were found by Sylvia Bowers, a fishing vessel which happened to be passing as it travelled from Buckie, Moray . 'We just hoped somebody would come along but we never gave up hope. We ran the boat's engine at night to keep us warm. I got an hour's sleep, David got half an hour.' Mr Reid said the pair spotted dozens of big ships passing them as they waited, but the ships were too far away for them to alert. He said: 'I fired off my two rockets on the first night but then we were out. We just kept going and tried to conserve the fuel. It was such a shock and relief to see that boat come.' The two men were said to be feeling fine after they were found and even felt cheery enough to have photo with one of the crew who found the men, pictured . The families, who feared the two men had drowned, were overwhelmed when they received the news that their loved ones were safe. Speaking to The Evening Express David Irvine Senior, Mr Irvine's father, said: 'It’s just a miracle. I had kept hope when there was nothing found from the boat. 'I had to try and keep it together for everyone else. It is just unbelievable - I burst to tears when I found out.' Mr Irvine's mother Marion Irvine said it felt like she was 'in a dream' after her son was rescued. The 53-year-old said: 'I thought I was . dreaming. I don’t know what’s happened to them on the water and there . was always hope they would be found. The two men returned to shore today to their waiting families who said it was 'a miracle' they had been found . 'I have been tearful for the past few days and this is just unreal.' And Mr Reid's sister Dorothy Milne, 72, who lost her nephew at sea more than two decades ago, said: 'It's just magic, that's all I can say. 'We found out he was lost on Tuesday. My sister and I were away on a trip. I just thought, we've lost another at sea. Dorothy Milne, 72, who is Jim Reid's sister, said it was 'magic' that the men had been found . 'I heard he had been found this morning. I was lying in my bed. My brother-in-law phoned and said 'I hope you're lying down', and I thought, he's about to tell me they're dead. 'He said: 'They're alive, Dot - 50 miles away they are'. It's just a dream. There must be a God.' Mark Spence, understood to be a crewman on the boat that found the missing men, which was travelling from Buckie, Moray, wrote on Facebook: 'Ma night was affa boring untill we came across the two lads thats been lost at sea for 3 days now (sic). 'Got the lads on board safe and sound, now towing their boat to montrose to get them ashore, both men safe and sound.' Skipper of the Sylvia Bowers, James Spencer, said his crew had set sail from Buckie on Tuesday and were heading to the English Channel at the time. The 47-year-old, who lives in Buckie, said: 'They were very lucky. 'The two lads on watch were following a predetermined line and it just so happened that this boat was just off the line. 'They passed close by and they were waving at us. They were in a small boat and it was strange because they were 45 miles off the land. 'We didn't actually know what was wrong until they came alongside us and explained they had been out for three days.' A police spokesman said: 'Police Scotland can confirm that the two fisherman, David Irvine and James Reid, missing from the Gourdon area, have been found safe and well today, approximately 46 miles off the coast of Montrose after being spotted by a passing fishing vessel.' Chief coastguard Richard Martin said: 'We are delighted that the two men have been found safe and well, and will be reunited with their families. 'We thank all those involved in this search and rescue operation - including the crew of the Sylvia Bowers, the fishing boat which found the men.'","Jim Reid, 75 and grandson David Irvine, 35, reported missing on Tuesday .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Convicted: Sergeant Alexander Blackman was found guilty of murder by a court martial in November . A Royal Marine who murdered a wounded Afghan fighter in cold blood has failed in his attempt to overturn the conviction. But sergeant Alexander Blackman - who fired a pistol into the man's chest with the words 'shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***' - had his sentence reduced by two years. Three leading judges decided that combat stress suffered by Blackman, 39, should have been given more weight, and cut the time he would have to serve in jail from ten years to eight. The soldier was convicted by a court martial Bulford, Wiltshire in November. He was originally known as Marine A, but the High Court ruled that his name should be released when he was first sentenced. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir Brian Leveson and Lady Justice Hallett, giving their ruling in London, said that the particular stresses affecting Blackman should have been 'accorded greater weight as a mitigating factor'. Allowing an appeal against sentence, Lord Thomas said: 'On all the evidence before us it is clear that in the events surrounding the murder of the insurgent, the appellant acted entirely out of character and was suffering from combat stress disorder'. As well as the life sentence Blackman, now 39, was 'dismissed with disgrace' from the Royal Marines after he had served with distinction for 15 years, including tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. The killing happened in Helmand province in 2011 while Blackman, who is known as Al, was serving with Plymouth-based 42 Commando. Scroll down for video . Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine . Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing . He shot the Afghan, who had been seriously injured in an attack by an Apache helicopter, in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol before. He referenced Shakespeare's Hamlet as the man convulsed and died in front of him. Blackman said: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It's nothing you wouldn't do to us'. He then turned to comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention'. His younger colleagues were cleared of any wrongdoing. Known as Marines B and C during the trial, they were later named as Corporal Christopher Watson and Marine Jack Hammond. The shooting was captured on a camera mounted on Cpl Watson's helmet. Blackman, who denied murder, said he believed the victim was already dead and he was taking out his anger on a corpse. Wife: Clair Blackman was at the High Court today for the result of the appeal . Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty . He has said he felt ashamed, describing the killing as a 'stupid lack of self-control and lapse in judgment'. Reducing the minimum term, Lord Thomas said: 'It is very unfortunate that the only medical evidence before the court martial and before us was obtained over two years after the murder. 'We have accorded particular attention to the view of the court martial that thousands of other service personnel experienced the same or similar stresses and still acted properly and humanely. Blackman: Right, get him closer so PGSS can't see what we're doing to him. Unknown: (Place/push) him in there, come on. Blackman: Get him right in. Unknown: Come on. Blackman: Over by that corn. LATER . Marine D: Do you want him back in? Blackman: Yeah, I want, I want him in this area so I can see what the f*** (we're/ I'm) doing. Blackman: Anybody want to do first aid on this idiot? Unknown: No. Marine B: No. Marine C: I'll put one in his head, if you want. Blackman: No, not in his head, cause that'll be f***ing obvious. Unknown: Just move him round here. Marine B: Going to switch this f***ing off (camera). LATER . Marine B: For f***'s sake, I cannot believe I'm doing this. Marine C: Wait a minute, just present to do it tiLl he's behind them trees. Unknown: Just strangle him. LATER . (Gun shot) Unknown: (What was that?) Unknown: (Don't know.) Blackman: There you are, shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. Blackman: It's nothing you wouldn't do to us. Marine B: I know. Blackman: Obviously, this doesn't go anywhere fellas. Marine B: Yeah, roger, mate. Blackman: I've just broken the Geneva convention. Marine B: Yeah, roger. Blackman: Biometric data module, right, er, try and brush some of that s*** off his face. Marine B: If anything gets heard, mate, it's as a warning shot went down. 'However, in assessing the evidence of stress and its effect on the appellant, we attach particular importance to the evidence in relation to the remoteness of the command post at which the appellant had been stationed for five and a half months and the limited contact with those commanding him. 'His mental welfare had not been assessed in the way in which it would ordinarily be assessed by a commanding officer and there is evidence that he was becoming somewhat paranoiac about the Taliban's ""gunning"" for him'. The judge added: 'Taking into account the whole of the evidence, we conclude that combat stress arising from the nature of the insurgency in Afghanistan and the particular matters we have identified as affecting him ought to have been accorded greater weight as a mitigating factor'. Lord Thomas announced: ""On that basis we have therefore concluded that although he remains subject to a sentence of imprisonment for life, the minimum term which he must serve before being considered for parole should be reduced to eight years. 'His release will then depend on the Parole Board and, even thereafter, he will remain subject to the terms of the conditions of his licence. To that extent and to that extent only is this appeal allowed'. Referring to the 'aggravating' features of the case, Lord Thomas said the first related to the circumstances of the shooting as found proved by the court martial. 'These included four deliberate acts. These were, first, the appellant's decision to stop first aid; second, the appellant's order to move the insurgent to a place where what he intended to do would not be seen; third, the discharge of the round into the insurgent's chest; and fourth, the instruction to the patrol to say nothing about what had happened'. Lord Thomas said: 'True it may be that there may have been other insurgents in the vicinity, but that played no causative effect in the appellant's decision to fire at the wounded insurgent and kill him'. The second aggravating feature 'was the deliberate involvement by the appellant of soldiers who looked to him for leadership in a dishonest cover up of what had happened and the construction of the account that the insurgent was already dead'. Lord Thomas said: 'Third was the appellant's failure to follow, both personally as a soldier and, furthermore, as the person in command of the patrol, the standards of conduct which represented the values for which HM Forces had been sent to Afghanistan'. An MoD spokesman said after the ruling: 'We respect the authority and decision of the appeal court, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the sentence'.","Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, killed an Afghan man in 2011 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The number of people arriving in the UK from the rest of Europe surged by 27 per cent last year, new figures showed today. In a major blow for David Cameron on the day of European elections, the data confirms that net migration into the UK is running at more than twice his target of cutting it to the ‘tens of thousands’. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a surge in people coming for work, with the biggest rise amongst people from elsewhere in the European Union. Tory leader David Cameron had set a target of bringing net migration to below 100,000, which now seems almost impossible to meet . Throughout last year a total of 201,000 . EU citizens arrived in the UK, a ‘statistically significant increase . from 158,000 the previous year’, the ONS said. In 2013 a total of 526,000 people moved to the UK and 314,000 left, giving a net migration figure of 212,000. This is up from 177,000 in 2012, and level with the year to the end of September. The number of people arriving was up 5 per cent year-on-year, with 43,000 more EU citizens and 11,000 fewer non-EU citizens arriving. Among those coming from across Europe, 125,000 came to find work, up from 95,000 in 2012. In 2013 a total of 526,000 people moved to the UK and 314,000 left, giving a net migration figure of 212,000 . There was a dramatic rise in the . number of people from Romania and Bulgaria moving to the UK, even before . work restrictions were lifted on January 1 this year. A total of 23,000 people travelled from the two countries in 2013, up from just 9,000 the previous year. The largest increases in new registrations for National Insurance numbers - needed to work and claim benefits - were also among citizens of Romania - up 29,000 to 47,000. Other large increases were among people from Poland (up 11,000 to 102,000), Italy (up 9,000 to 42,000) and Bulgaria (up 7,000 to 18,000) from the previous year . Some 70 per cent of people from Romania and Bulgaria arrived for work-related reasons. It . follows figures last week which showed an estimated 122,000 Romanians . and Bulgarians were employed in the UK in the first three months of . 2014, up from 103,000 in the same period in 2013. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'Despite the Government's best efforts and repeated commitments to reducing the net migration figure it has remained the same. 'Controlling EU migration is impossible without reform. It is clear that their aim is unrealistic and unachievable. The Government should drop their target now. 'The flood of immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria has not arrived and these figures show that they were already in the country. 'The need for estimates is plainer than ever. Only by knowing the facts can we ensure that the immigration debate cannot be hijacked by those looking to stir up racial tensions.' The figures emerging on the day of European elections are a blow for Mr Cameron, pictured after voting with his wife Samantha today . The issue of immigration has dominated campaigning in the European elections, with Ukip seeking to capitalise on public anger to top the polls. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said today: 'With under a year left to the general election the verdict is clear. 'David Cameron has broken his solemn promise to the British people on one of the most important political issues. 'And . he has done so because he refuses to take back control of our borders . in respect of more than 400million people from more than two dozen . countries on continental Europe.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Tories had broken their promise to voters . Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire said: 'Uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on our public services and forces down wages for people on low incomes. 'While recent net migration levels remain stable the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this Government's reforms have cut net migration from outside the EU to levels not seen since the late 1990s. 'We are building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law. We want to ensure that people come to the UK for the right reasons - to work hard and contribute to our economy and society.' At the weekend Mr Cameron sought to play down the Tory pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands. The promise in the Conservative's 2010 manifesto is not official government policy because the Lib Dems have always refused to sign up to it. Challenged about his chances of meeting the target before the 2015 election, Mr Cameron told Sky News: 'We are working towards it, we are doing everything we can to deliver on it and we should continue to do that.' He went on: 'I want to see net migration down to the tens of thousands not only because it is right for the British economy because we should be training our own people for these jobs. 'But also if you look back to the 1980s when net migration was in the tens of thousands, we were an open economy then. 'But do you know what, immigration wasn’t a big political issue because it was properly under control and that’s what I want to achieve again.' Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: 'David Cameron and Theresa May's flagship immigration pledge is in shreds. 'They promised ‘no ifs, no buts’ to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament, and the actual figure is over twice that. 'By making such loud promises and failing to meet them, Theresa May and David Cameron have further eroded trust on immigration and undermined confidence in a government’s ability to address people’s concerns.'","201,000 .

"By . Mark Duell . Improvement: Christina Sadler, 45, said her son Tom Roberts, 12, has turned his life around . A mother who dubbed her 12-year-old son ‘Britain’s naughtiest schoolboy’ said today he had turned his life around after appearing on Channel 4 show Mr Drew’s School For Boys. Tom Roberts, of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, has suffered with behavioural problems since he was 16 months old - and would even try to climb out of his cot and out of windows. His mother Christina Sadler, 45, said she tried everything to discipline her child before he was permanently expelled from school. She then signed Tom up to Educating Essex star Mr Drew’s residential summer school, which aims to improve the lives of troubled boys. Tom has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with symptoms including short attention spans, restlessness and being easily distracted. Tom’s bad behaviour started from an early age and in Year Two he was often in trouble for fighting and hitting other children at break times. Mrs Sadler said: ‘There were times when I thought I’d got Britain’s naughtiest boy on my hands. I just didn’t know what to do any more. I saw an advert in one of the magazines for Mr Drew and I was desperate so I signed us up.’ A turning point in Tom’s life was when his father died in 2009 - and Mrs Sadler, who has two daughters she describes as ‘angels’, was regularly asked to come into his former school. She said: ‘I was called into school every day to help monitor his behaviour but the teachers were telling me he was fine. It was confusing and I got a lot of mixed signals.’ However, his behaviour worsened and it . was behavioural experts who eventually diagnosed Tom with ADHD - but not . before a series of naughty incidents. Channel 4 reality star: Stephen Drew teaches history and is deputy head of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, which was chosen as the school for the documentary series Educating Essex in 2011 . Troubled: Tom Roberts, of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, has suffered with behavioural problems since he was 16 . Mrs Sadler said: ‘At Christmas he . wasn’t even allowed to meet Father Christmas because he couldn’t wait in . the queue with the other children.’ Tom . was put on medication and his condition began to improve but a low dose . in the morning would mean his behaviour would deteriorate by the . afternoon. Eventually, teachers had enough - and, after being suspended five times, he was excluded from school. Mrs Sadler said: ‘The day he was . permanently excluded I was all out of ideas. I saw the advert for Mr . Drew and thought we had nothing to lose. On TV: Mrs Sadler (left) signed Tom (centre) up to Educating Essex star Mr Drew's residential summer course . Happier: Mr Drew worked around the pupils' major interests on the course, and that was football for Tom . ‘Mr Drew is a real genius - he has the patience of a saint. Tom looked up to him and his behaviour really improved.’ Kicked out: After being suspended five times, 12-year-old Tom was excluded from school . Mr Drew and his team of specialists looked at the behaviour of the children as well as their parents. Each day began with an assembly for pupils and families, followed by the boys going to lessons while the parents received classes in parenting. The families would be reunited in the afternoons to attend physical education or art lessons  together. Mr Drew also worked around the pupils’ major interests, and that was football for Tom. The boy told the Liverpool Echo: ‘Steven Gerrard is my hero. When it’s not going well he keeps his head up and keeps trying. That was what we learnt. Just keep trying.’ As well as the benefits of Tom’s behavioural improvement, the show had other advantages. Mrs Sadler said she has made long-term friendships with the other mothers who all had one thing in common - their problem sons. She added: ‘We were all in it together and knew what each other was going through. Some days Tom was the worst there, but all the boys took a turn. 'The boys still talk on Facebook and we’re planning a get-together soon.

"By . Wills Robinson . Dog breeder Lisa Walsh, 47, from Barnham Broom near Norwich, is facing jail after claiming her puppies were Kennel Club registered . A dog breeder is facing jail after she admitted cheating pet owners out of more than £171,000 by claiming her puppies were Kennel Club registered and had clean health records. Lisa Walsh, 47, operated her dog breeding scam from a number of addresses, including Greenacres Farm in Tasburgh, Norfolk. Walsh, from Barnham Broom, near Norwich, duped customers into paying an average of £500 per dog, the court heard. The single mother had over £43,000 stashed in a building society account when she was arrested. Walsh also falsified paperwork declaring puppies had been inoculated against deadly diseases such as parvovirus when they had not. The health and wellbeing of dogs was an 'irrelevance' to her as she focused purely on making money out of the con, Norwich Crown Court was told. David Wilson, prosecuting on behalf of Norfolk Trading Standards, said some of the puppies bought from Walsh were vomiting and had diarrhoea when the new owners took them home. Others also suffered health problems. Walsh sold one Labrador puppy which needed a £5,000 operation on its hip and another had to be put down after it contracted parvovirus. Mr Wilson said outraged pet owners would not have gone to her in the first place if they had known the brutal truth. Walsh had denied participating in a fraudulent business between September 2009 and October 2012. But she changed her plea to guilty on the third day of what was to be a four-week trial. At an earlier hearing, Walsh admitted two allegations of fraud in making false representations that the puppies had been vaccinated. Judge Anthony Bate said trading standards officers had shown she had pocketed about £171,000. and could face jail. Walsh, of Barnham Broom, near Norwich, duped customers into paying an average £500 per dog . But he said the sentence could be suspended as she was a single parent with a child with special needs. Walsh began to cheat clients after her husband died in 2009, the court heard. Walsh also bought in litters from other sources - then claimed she bred them herself. She would also register extra puppies that did not exist to generate 'phantom' paperwork. And when Walsh did not own an adult of the same breed to show as the mother she told buyers the mothers had died giving birth. She ran her dog breeding scam from a number of addresses, including Greenacres Farm in Tasburgh near Norwich . She spun the same lie about three separate broods of West Highland Terriers and a litter of Cocker Spaniels. Norfolk Trading Standards launched an investigation after a string of complaints and Walsh was arrested in April 2012. Last night a trading standards spokesman said: 'We are pleased that Lisa Walsh has pleaded guilty to these charges. 'It is a very good outcome for what has been a long, detailed and complex investigation by our trading standards officers. 'It’s also a very good outcome for the many people who were deceived by her.' Walsh's sentencing was adjourned for reports and a date is yet to be set. She sold a number of breeds, including West Highland Terriers, left, and Cocker Spaniels, right (file pictures) Norwich Crown Court heard the health and wellbeing of the dogs was an 'irrelevance' to Mrs Walsh .","Single mother Lisa Walsh, 47, swindled money from dog owners in Norfolk .

"By . Amanda Williams . A couple who spent £350,000 they raided from a charity set up to help families and orphans from Afghanistan on cars and shopping sprees have been jailed for a total of eight years. Syed Hajnajafi, 50, and Akila Kassam, 46, were working as trustees of Afghan Poverty Relief, which was set up to provide families with water, food and medical supplies. But the couple plundered the accounts of the organisation, and blew the cash on luxury cars and high street spending sprees. Syed Hajnajafi, 50, and Akila Kassam, 46, were working as trustees of Afghan Poverty Relief, which was set up to provide families with water, food and medical supplies . The pair, who have a seven-year-old child together, had control of the bank account. The Afghan . Poverty Relief raised money through individual donations, collections . in mosques and received lump sums from other charities and benefactors . across the globe. They wept in the dock as Judge Warwick McKinnon told them: ‘This was a sophisticated scheme that evolved with numerous bogus receipts written down to pretend that monies of the charity had gone out to Afghanistan for the relief of poverty when the money had been stolen in cash by you. ‘It was indeed difficult to hear the evidence as to how those substantial sums of money would be withdrawn from the charity, taken in cash and then one or both of you would travel the short distance to a bank 100-200 yards away often within just a few minutes and that money would be placed in a personal account. ‘On the evidence I have heard this was a genuine charity and set up for a genuine charitable purpose and that you both had a charitable objective in mind.’ Judge McKinnon said he was ‘satisfied’ Hajnajafi was passionate about the plight of his native country but added he was the ‘driving force’ behind the thefts. But the couple plundered the accounts of the organisation, and blew the cash on luxury cars and high street spending sprees. They have today been jailed for a total of eight years . ‘It is of very great regret that it appears in order for you to have an income and a substantial income at that - more than the income that Mrs Kassam was earning when she was employed - that you were tempted in the way that you obviously were. ‘It appears to me that it started in a fairly small way and once you has seen how easy it was to steal the charity’s money it mushroomed,’ said Judge McKinnon. ‘This was money to keep you in the style and beyond the style to which you had become accustomed over a period of time. ‘It is difficult to envisage a worse type of breach of trust offence that stealing from a charity when you are a trustee of that charity which is what you both were - you were the principle trustees of that charity. The judge jailed Kassam for three years and Hajnajafi for five. ‘These cases - when they fall they fall hard indeed,’ the judge added. Both defendants wept in the dock before they were led away to the cells. Kassam was born in Uganda and came to the UK in the 1970s when she was around three. She was granted citizenship as a refugee. Hajnajafi come to this country from Afghanistan in around 2000 and was granted British citizenship when the couple married. Peter Rowland, defending Hajnajafi told Croydon Crown Court he had been a man of high standing in his community, and his ‘shame’ was punishment in itself. Kassam’s counsel Di Middleton insisted she played a lesser role and was ‘somewhat limited’ in her involvement. Kassam and Hajnajafi, both of Nunhead, southeast London, denied but were convicted of theft of £350,010 from Afghan Poverty Relief between January 2004 and November 2011. They will face a further hearing to determine how much cash they must repay at a future date.","Syed Hajnajafi, 50, and Akila Kassam, 46, trustees of Afghan Poverty Relief .

"By . Mark Duell . It was June 6, 1944, and shells were falling all around him as he made a ‘wild scramble to the shore’ and recoiled from the ‘din of battle’. But Leopole ‘Eric’ Wormald, of Mickley, Northumberland, never boasted about his exploits during the Second World War - including how he survived D-Day after landing on the beaches of Normandy. Now, the shop grocer’s secret diaries have been revealed - telling of his quiet heroism amid the horrors that he witnessed during his service with the Army from 1941 to 1945. Discovery: Grandfather-of-two Cedric Wormald (left) wants to share the story of his father Leopole 'Eric' Wormald (right) with others as the country prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day . Prisoner of war details: Eric Wormald described how he was captured and taken to a POW camp surviving on little food and celebrating his birthday while imprisoned . Soldiers: In his diary Eric Wormald talked of friends he had not seen and how he hoped they were safe . It was not until after his death in . the 1980s aged 77 that his wife Gladys and son Cedric discovered the diary he wrote on D-Day and letters while he . was a prisoner of war. Grandfather-of-two . Cedric Wormald, 66, of Howdon, Tyne and Wear, now wants to share his father’s story with others . as the country prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day. He . said: ‘He obviously wanted someone to read it at some time. I would . just like to share it. 'You either write it down and one day someone will . read it or you write it down to get it out of your mind. I just think . others should know what it was like.’ In . the pages of his diary, Eric Wormald speaks of the moment he arrived on . the beaches, losing members of his company and narrowly escaping mortar . bomb blasts. 'Forever yours': A letter written to Gladys Wormald, Eric Wormald's wife, when he was a prisoner of war . Couple: Eric and Gladys Wormald are pictured. Cedric Wormald believes the notes his father made on D-Day were written on his return home to the North East . Rolled up: Cedric Wormald, with his father's cigarette case containing a picture of Gladys and two German cigarettes . From his D-Day notes, marked June 6, 1944, he writes: ‘After breakfast I went on deck and could hear the bombers going out and could see the flashes from their bombs on the French coast.’ Thousands of Allied soldiers, mostly from the United States, Britain and Canada, landed in Normandy to begin the drive to break the German occupation of Europe in 1944. The soldiers charged the shores of five beaches in northern France, facing German land mines, machine guns and heavy artillery. The invasion, a victory for the allies, is known as the key turning point of the war. Some 215,000 Allied soldiers, and roughly as many Germans, were killed or wounded during D-Day and the ensuing three months before the Allies captured Normandy, opening a path toward Paris that eventually took them to Germany and victory over the Nazis. Later in the day, he continues: ‘The sight at sea was one which will take some describing. Ships of all sorts and sizes and the din of battle was all around. ‘On one side of us we had HMS Renown and on the other side HMS Rodney. We were very lucky as shells were falling all around us. Landed on beach (first LCA [Landing Craft Assault] to land) 7.45am. ‘Jumped into sea which was up to my shoulders, nearly lost my balance and fell. Made a wild scramble to the shore and got to the sands safely. Going up the sands, there were many things in my mind. ‘First my wife, lying peacefully in bed, little did she know that the invasion was in progress and that I was on French soil at that moment, I thought of everyone at home and wondered how they would take the news.’ Cedric Wormald believes the notes his father made on D-Day were written on his return home to the North East.

In the notes he made on D-Day, Eric Wormald described his terrifying moments on the infamous beach . ‘I think when he came back he wrote that, whether to get it out of his mind, or they said “Write down what you went through on the day”,’ he said. ‘I was very proud of him when I read it. He has always been my hero - but when you see what he went through and how he came back to the shop and just picked up normal life, it’s amazing.’ In the notes he made on D-Day, Eric Wormald went on to describe his terrifying moments on the beach. ‘Then it happened, the next mortar bomb dropped near us and Dossol, Knight and two others were wounded, how badly I don’t know because I could not think of anything else but to get away from the attack. I took a chance and ran to the top of the beach.’ Eric Wormald said he thanked God for his good luck so far as he was the only one to escape without a scratch. In his diary he talked of friends he had not seen and how he hoped they were safe. ‘Got off beaches and fought on all day. Lost a good many of the company including Lt Bawdon and Lt Williamson (Both killed in action),’ he wrote. Writing about the night after D-Day, he said: ‘Slept as best we could at night in jerry dug outs, hardly saw any jerry planes until dusk. ‘Next morning my first job was to make Major Matt’s breakfast and my own. Fought on all next day. Our worst encounters were Jerry snipers. Killed one French woman sniping for Jerry and captured other two. ‘We also took a large number of prisoners. June 10, marched through streets of Bayeux. A little French girl filled my hat with cherries and gave me a lovely rose. (If ever there were tears in my eyes it was at this moment). ‘Camped the night outside Bayeux, moved on next day. June 13 got ambushed by Jerry and with four others got cut off from rest.’ Eric Wormald then described how he was captured and taken to a Prisoner of War camp, surviving on little food and celebrating his birthday while imprisoned. ‘July 4 being my 36th birthday and a POW in Germany,’ he continued. ‘July 16 received first Red and parcel. July 21 comfort parcel. Allowed to send card home. ‘August 3 left Stalag 12A by train and arrived Stalag 4B. August 5. While there I wrote a number of cards home and we could get news every day about the war.’ He added: ‘Started work in stone quarry on 11th. Damned hard job and little food. First pay 25 Marks per month. Received first letter from home on October 25. ‘Nothing much to write about, time is going quick, only work and sleep. Don’t get much news now, letters arriving better but no parcels coming through. ‘Xmas day was lousy. New Year’s Day just as bad, very cold but not much snow. Jan, still looking forward to finish of war. Feb, we all hope that this month will see it through. ‘Some news that the war is progressing in our favour. Air raids getting more frequent. March, weather much better, still no sign of war being finished. No letters for three weeks, not much special news. ‘April, another weary month, all work and no play. Everyone feeling very weak through lack of food. News that the Yanks are advancing fast.’ In the last paragraphs, he tells of liberation. ‘Handed over next morning and taken to X POW camp. Plenty of food and news. There two weeks and left by truck for Halle. Left Halle by plane.’ Historic: The soldier was involved in the D-Day landings on the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944 (file picture)","Second World War veteran Leopole 'Eric' Wormald died aged 77 in 1980s .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Search: Detectives say they will be making 'substantial' efforts in their hunt to find missing Madeleine McCann over the coming weeks . Detectives looking for Madeleine McCann will begin 'substantial' work on their investigation in Portugal within weeks. Officers from the Metropolitan Police are working with Portuguese police during a fresh phase of their hunt for the missing girl, who disappeared aged three on a family holiday in the resort of Praia da Luz. Mark Rowley, the assistant commissioner of the force, said: 'In the forthcoming weeks we are going to be going to a substantial phase of operational activity on the ground in Portugal. 'A thorough serious crime investigation . works systematically through all the credible possibilities, and often . in an investigation you will have more than one credible possibility'. However, he warned that they may not come up with answers quickly - or at all. The announcement came weeks after detectives were spotted using a helicopter to take aerial photos in the holiday resort where Madeleine disappeared after being left in her room by parents Gerry and Kate McCann. Police were then preparing to excavate three areas in the resort in the hope of turning up clues. Though they were not given permission to conduct the dig themselves, experts were on hand to oversee the work - including those trained to detect bodies. British police officers have been negotiating with their Portuguese counterparts throughout the search. It is thought they have requested permission to question eight crucial witnesses in their investigation. However other requests - including plans to raid homes of prime suspects - were refused. Aerial . view: Specialist officers are expected to examine several sites in . Praia da Luz after permission to dig was granted by Portuguese . authorities, seven years after Maddie went missing from the area aged . three . Mr Rowley said: 'I want to be able to go back to Kate and Gerry at some stage in the future and tell them we’ve got to the bottom of this, or second best is to go back to them and say we’ve turned over every stone and we can’t get to an answer sometimes'. A number of officers from Scotland Yard are hoping to be involved in the latest phase of activity, though it is being led by the Portuguese. Mr and Mrs McCann have been briefed on the activity, but will not travel to Portugal while the work is being carried out. 'The activity in Portugal is led by the Portuguese, that’s absolutely crystal clear in law,' Mr Rowley said. 'We have some officers who would like to be helping with that on the ground in Portugal, doing some of the work we anticipate. We are putting the finishing touches to the plans to the Portuguese in the coming weeks'. He added: 'I anticipate a substantial phase of activity in forthcoming weeks including Portuguese and British officers but the detail of that is still being finalised with Portuguese colleagues and it will all be under Portuguese leadership.' Briefed: Gerry and Kate McCann, pictured at a prayer service earlier this month - have been told about the police plans, but will not visit the resort during the investigation . Hunt: Portuguese police initially searched the resort, but the Met will look for anything they might have missed . One line of inquiry for Scotland Yard is a lone male paedophile who staged a series of sex attacks on young British girls while they were on holiday in the Algarve. They are looking at nine sexual assaults and three 'near misses' on British girls aged six to 12 between 2004 and 2006, including one in 2005 on a 10-year-old girl in Praia da Luz, where Madeleine vanished two years later. Hundreds of people have already made contact with police in response to appeals to try to find the attacker. Mr Rowley warned that, after sifting through all the possible lines of inquiry, officers may draw a blank. 'There’s lots of potential lines of inquiry', he said. 'If we didn’t think there were any potentially fruitful lines of inquiry, we wouldn’t be where we are today; we would be saying there’s nowhere to go with this investigation. 'There are many potential fruitful lines of inquiry and the only way you get anywhere is to work through them all systematically. 'Within that may be the answer and the case may be potentially solvable. We may be able to work through potential lines of inquiry over a period of time with the Portuguese and all of them draw a blank, that can happen'.","Police have said that new work will begin soon in Praia de Luz, Portugal .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A 'toxic childhood' of cyberbullying, social media and hypersexualised culture is leading one in five teenagers to self-harm, according to experts . A 'toxic childhood' of cyberbullying, social media and hypersexualised culture is leading one in five teenagers to self-harm, according to experts. According to a new study by the World Health Organisation, the number of teenagers in England who self-harm has trebled in the last 12 years. The Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) report, which is due to be published this autumn, revealed that 20 percent of the 15-year-olds questioned said they had harmed themselves within the last 12 months. When a similar study of self-harm in England was published by the British Medical Journal in 2002 it revealed that 6.9 percent of the 6,000 15 and 16-year-olds questioned said they had self-harmed in the previous year. Some experts have put the worrying trend down to pressures put on children who are increasingly living a higher proportion of their lives online, frequently using social networks which can put added pressed on youngsters. Children, especially girls, are also increasingly coming under pressure from cyberbullying, and an apparent heightening of sexualisation in childhood. Lucie Russell, director of campaigns at the Young Minds charity, told The Times: 'Add that to bullying on and offline, the stresses of school and exams, uncertainly about their future and increasing sexual pressures, and it is a very bleak picture,' she told newspaper. As part of the HBSC report, 6,000 children aged 11, 13, and 15 living in England were asked if they had self-harmed. The question was included in the study, carried out every four years, after a number of teachers reported seeing an increase in instances of self-harm, which encompasses actions such as cutting, burning and even biting. Professor Fiona Brooks, the head of adolescent and child health at the University of Hertfordshire, has been helping to put together the WHO report. Scroll down for video . Experts have put the worrying trend down to pressures put on children who are increasingly living a higher proportion of their lives online . She said that boys and girls aged 11 had displayed a good level of emotional wellbeing, but at 15 a gap had emerged between the sexes, with 45 per cent of girls reporting that they felt unhappy once a week. The same was true of 23 per cent of boys. She told The Guardian: 'We don't yet know enough about why this [poor mental health] is but parents are busy and stressed, and children's lives are becoming more pressurised. They know they need better grades to get to university, but there's no guarantee of a job at the end of it all.' She added that teenagers are 'turning to strategies such as self-harm to manage stress in the short term'. News of the WHO study comes after government health advisers warned last week that overuse of the internet is causing mental health problems for children. At 15 a gap emerges between the sexes, with 45 percent of girls reporting that they felt unhappy once a week. The same was true of 23 percent of boys . Public Health England, which issues guidance on good health to the NHS, says there is a clear relationship between the amount of time spent on social media sites such as Facebook and ‘lower levels of well-being’. The link becomes particularly striking when children spend more than four hours a day in front of a screen – but it kicks in even at very low levels of use, according to the report. The report also notes that the number of calls to ChildLine about online bullying, suicidal thoughts and self-harm have soared in recent years. In a separate report, the Children’s Commissioner for England said social media sites were ‘targeting’ vulnerable young people and exposing them to the dangers of sexual exploitation. Dr Maggie Atkinson also highlighted a surge in the number of under-18s being admitted to adult psychiatric wards.","World Health Organisation says 20% of 15-year-olds self-harmed in last year .

"By . John Hall . A German farmer has discovered metal and human bones in a field - raising suspicions they may be the remains of a British tank and its crew which fell prey to the Nazis less than a week before VE Day. Martin Bergbauer, 55, said his tractor struck a hard object as he cut the grass in the field. On kneeling down to inspect the damage he realised he had hit a large chunk of metal. Aware of rumours that a British tank had been destroyed in the area near his field in Kutenholz - a municipality near the German city of Stade in Lower Saxony - during the final few days of the Second World War, Mr Bergbauser called in the police who subsequently found human remains. Remains: It is thought the chunk of metal may be the track cover from a Cromwell tank belonging to the British Army's 7th Armoured Division. If that's the case, the occupants are likely to have died just days before VE Day . Discovery: Officers arriving at the site called in bomb disposal experts who managed to uncover the armoured side of a tank and also parts of a human skeleton, including the thigh bone . Officers arriving at the site called in bomb disposal experts who managed to uncover the armoured side of a tank and also parts of a human skeleton, including the thigh bone. Police spokesman Rainer . Bohmbach said digging stopped as soon as the bomb disposal . units were able to determine there was unlikely to be anything dangerous close to . the surface. The human remains have now been sent away for analysis, and the site temporarily sealed off. British forces did not reach the area where the tank was found until the very final stages of the Second World War, so if the debris does turn out to be the remains of a British tank, it is likely to have been destroyed within a week of VE day. On hold: Police spokesman Rainer Bohmbach said digging temporarily stopped as soon as the bomb disposal units were able to determine there was unlikely to be anything dangerous close to the surface . Although it cannot be determined how the tank was destroyed from the handful of photographs that have been released, it almost certainly hit a landmine or came up against a basic anti-tank gun, as the last remnants of the Nazi army in the area had little or no access to tanks themselves. John Delaney, collections manager at the Imperial War Museum, said the evidence provided and the size and shape of the chunk of metal discovered, suggests the debris is likely to have come from a Cromwell tank belonging to the 7th Armoured Division. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'The . unusual thing about those units in the British army is that they weren't . by-and-large equipped with the Sherman tank, they were equipped almost . exclusively with the Cromwell tank.' A Cromwell tank of 7th Armoured Division on the Bremen-Hamburg autobahn. It is thought the remains in the field - less than 30 miles from where this photo was taken - belong to the same regiment and type of tank . 'That's the right size for the bit of wreckage that has been recovered, and also it's the right shape.' 'What you're looking at there is the cover that goes over the top of the track. And then it bolts on to the side of tank using brackets - which are the small ridges you can see in the image'. 'Because the cover is long and rectangular, it's not a Sherman. Which means it's probably a Cromwell, which fits with it possibly being 7th Armoured Division, whose units we believe were operating in the area at the time'. If the remains are confirmed as belonging to British soldiers, they are likely to be buried at the closest Commonwealth War Graves cemetery that has space. That is understood to be at Reichswald (pictured) Stuart Wheeler, librarian at the Tank Museum, confirmed that the 7th Armoured Division would have been in the right area at the time, adding the regiment is likely to have been following veteran reconnaissance units from the 2nd Derbyshire Yeoman and the 51st Highland Division. If this is the case, the argument that the suspected Cromwell was destroyed by a landmine or a heavily concealed anti-tank weapon - as opposed to a German tank regiment - is strengthened. The 7th Armoured Division is thought to have in excess of 100 Cromwell tanks in its possession at the time, but unfortunately there is no central database detailing when and where British tanks were lost during the Second World War. If the remains are confirmed as belonging to British soldiers, the next step would be for the German authorities to contact the British embassy, who would then attempt to identify the victims. Speaking to MailOnline, Peter Francis of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said his organisation would then get involved to make sure the remains were being handled with respect. They would insist the remains are handed over to with care, and are then likely to be buried at the closest Commonwealth War Graves cemetery where there is space. This is likely to be either the site at Reichswald, near the Rhine, or in Berlin. 'This process is done with the utmost respect for the remains. These people gave their lives for their country, and that should not be forgotten,' he said.","Remains thought to belong to a British tank were found in a German field .

Chloe’s pets, named Salt and Pepper, were suffering from smoke inhalation - so fire crews administered oxygen to the pair on a neighbour’s lawn while their colleagues battled the blaze. The inferno, which broke out on Friday evening, was caused by an electrical fault in an upstairs bedroom. It left a hole in the roof and in the bedroom floor alongside smoke damage. Although the gerbils escaped unharmed, the family have been left homeless, as the house needs six to seven months to be refurbished. And Chloe is having to sit her GCSE exams, despite all her revision notes going up in flames. Mission: Firefighter Pete Tilbury cradles one of the gerbils in his hands as the animal is given oxygen .

'I was out doing dance rehearsals when I got the call telling me the house was on fire and I rushed over. 'My mind was all over the place, watching my house go up in smoke, but I’m so glad the firemen were kind enough to find the gerbils and save them.

"By . Katy Winter . Most men who propose to their partner need only wait for a year or so preparing for the wedding before saying 'I do'. But patient Alan Crotty will finally wed his lifelong sweetheart tomorrow - 46 years after first proposing. The devoted pensioner was just 21 when he popped the question to Cathy Roberts on her 18th birthday on November 1 1968. Having been separated for 37 years following the end of their first engagement, the pair will finally marry tomorrow . Alan Crotty, pictured here with Cathy in 1968, was just 19 when he popped the question to Cathy on her 18th birthday. He was left heartbroken when their engagement ended two years later . He was left heartbroken when their engagement ended two years later and Cathy, 63, married someone else and moved away. Alan, 66, has remained single for his entire life and said Cathy - whose 1973 marriage ended after 10 years - was always the woman for him. A mutual friend reintroduced them in 2007 after 37 years apart and their love was instantly rekindled. Though Cathy married and divorced in their years apart, Alan remained single . Alan waited another four years before proposing to Cathy for a second time - at the same spot in London’s Sloane Square where he made his original request in 1968. To his delight Cathy said ‘Yes’ and they will tie the knot in Tenterden, Kent where they now live together. Alan, who was a railway photographer, said: 'Although we broke up Cathy was always the one for me. She had never left my mind - no one else would do. 'A friend got us back together by surprise at his home and I didn’t realise she was going to be there. 'I opened the front door, saw her and just said: ‘Hello, Cathy, do you want a cup of tea?’ 'I recognised her straight away despite the gap. 'We then went back to Sloane Square in 2011 and I proposed again. 'I didn’t have to buy another engagement ring as Cathy is using her grandmother’s one - but I still have the ring she gave me in 1968.' Cathy, a former bank worker, said: 'We saw each other for the first time after 37 years. It was as if I had seen him just two days before, as if the time had never passed. 'There was no awkwardness, no difficulty, nothing. We just picked up where we left off. 'Neither of us could remember what had happened or what had gone wrong and we couldn’t find anybody who could remember. 'I think we were always meant to be together, but he needed to develop his career, he did all the things he wanted to do.'","Alan was 21 when he popped the question to Cathy on her 18th birthday .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Abandoned and decaying, this eerie Cold War base was once was rumoured to house nuclear warheads in case of an attack but now stands empty, untouched since it was last used two decades ago. RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire was once a bustling strategic base for the U.S. Air Force, hosting huge B-52 bombers and a detachment of top secret U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, deployed to covertly check out latest Soviet weapons. However, 20 years after it was handed back to the Ministry of Defence the abandoned buildings are slowly falling into ruin, yet still display poignant reminders of the troops once stationed there - even down to a menu offering tastes of home such as chilli dogs and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Abandoned: RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire was once a bustling strategic base for the U.S. Air Force, but now stands empty two decades after it was handed back to the Ministry of Defence, its air traffic control tower slowly decaying . Empty: A guard tower situated on the perimeter of the base. One soldier is said to have committed suicide while on guard here, and there are rumours it is haunted . On the menu: A faded menu in the base's canteen reveals that airmen were given a taste of home with chili dogs, hamburgers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches . The site had been used by the Royal Air Force primarily as a training base from 1918 to 1950, before it was transferred to the United States Air Force (USAF) at the beginning of the Cold War. Under the control of US Strategic Air Command (SAC), and later as a home for United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), the base became a key strategic location during the period of political and military tension between East and West. The site was visited by urban explorer Darmon Richter, who gained access to the military site through a friend involved in a project to conserve the base, protecting items and buildings which hold significant historical value. In shadow: This darkened office was once the mission control centre at the base, which was transferred to the United States Air Force at the beginning of the Cold War . Reminder: This detailed graffiti featuring an old fashioned plane was scrawled on the wall of the avionic building by one bored airman . Warning: A sign printed onto the door of a walk-in freezer at the old barracks, as pictured by urban explorer Darmon Richter, who gained access to the military site through a friend involved in a conservation project at the site . Detail: A decaying map covers the wall of the mission control centre. Under the control of US Strategic Air Command the base became a key strategic location during the period of political and military tension between East and West . 'Through him, I was able to gain approval for my visit. It would have been virtually impossible without that permission, as the large base is still patrolled and guarded by a full security team,' said Mr Richter, from nearby Oxford. Amazingly, the menu in the troops' diner has survived intact, and a strong American theme - from chilli dogs, hamburgers and french fries to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - is clearly evident. 'Stepping into the staff diner was like taking a trip back in time and across continents,' Mr Richter said. 'None of it struck me as particularly appetising, though I suppose it was intended to make the US airmen feel at home.' Record: A log book, still intact after two decades, lies abandoned on top of a boiler in one of the derelict building at the Oxfordshire base . Rack and ruin: An overturned chair in the abandoned guardroom. Mr Richter described the base as 'unusually quiet', with no sounds of birds or other wildlife . Choice: The menu in the troops' diner has survived intact, and a strong American theme - from chilli dogs, hamburgers and french fries to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - is clearly evident . Seat of power: The site's Mission Control bunker was in regular communication with airbases around the world . Control: The order given to bomb Libya in 1986 in response to a discotheque bombing in Berlin, as part of an operation codenamed 'El Dorado Canyon' was reportedly given from this control room . One building that Mr Richter encountered was formed from a giant block of concrete and painted with windows to give the impression of an unassuming house. However, inside the reinforced concrete building, several vault doors led into a central storage space where the signs on the walls had been blacked out - with Mr Richter’s sources suggesting this was the space where nuclear warheads had been kept. The site’s Mission Control bunker was in regular communication with airbases around the world, and it was reportedly here that the order was given to bomb Libya in 1986 in response to a discotheque bombing in Berlin, as part of an operation codenamed 'El Dorado Canyon'. Dated technology: Sliding wall charts used display details of available aircraft and weaponry in the Heyford mission control centre . Telecommunications: Mr Richter described the sensation of walking through empty command rooms with the old maps and telephones as 'strange' In use: The first group of United States Air Force personnel arrived on the station in July 1950, with the original organisation consisting of one officer and 26 airmen . Out of use: A rusting electricity generator, which once helped provide the base, first used in 1916 as a home for the Royal Flying Corps, with power . Geography: Only a few details of this map of Hungary can still be seen, as it peels off the walls of the abandoned mission control centre . Warning: A caution board at the side of the main runway, which stretches for a total distance of 8,300 ft after it was extended in 1950 when the American forces moved in . 'It was a strange feeling, to walk through the empty command rooms with their maps and telephones, where these bombing orders had once been given,' Mr Richter said. 'The base felt at times unnaturally quiet. Although grass and vegetation grows throughout, there was no sound of birds or other wildlife. It was strange to explore such a large site, so completely devoid of life. 'Perhaps the most memorable thing about Upper Heyford was the size of the base. We spent a full day walking and driving around the compound, from the hangers and staff quarters, to store houses, watch towers, along the 8,300ft runway and through the command centres. Sketches: Graffiti on the wall of the avionic building still remains long after the airmen who painted it have gone . Illuminated: This panel still is connected to the electricity supply in the mission control centre, twenty years after the base was last used by American forces . Artifacts: Compressed air cylinders in the base's bomb store. The base has appeared in several film and television productions, portraying various fictional military sites, including Octopussy, Lewis, and World War Z . Historical value: Water-cooled pipes inside a testing bay designed for test firing jet engines . Protection: Several of the hardened aircraft shelters were placed on the English Heritage list of scheduled monuments in 2010. A bid was made in 2011 for the site to receive World Heritage Site status but it did not make the UK shortlist . 'As I walked around the base, I felt priviledged to be seeing inside the workings of such a large military installation. 'I would find myself imagining what the base had been like full of life, with aircraft moving between the hangers and the runways, and all the control centres filled with voices and ringing phones.' To read more about Darmon’s explorations, visit http://www.thebohemianblog.com. The writing on the wall: It is clear that this building was once home to the base's bomb store . Storage: An aircraft hangar designed to house dozens of US fighter jets. B-52 bombers, U-2 aircraft and Phantoms all flew from the site . In working order: The intercom system at the base is still fully functioning, long after the base itself closed down . Instructions: An instruction panel telling aircrew which items of clothing they should remove and when should they be exposed to dangerous gases . All quiet: This mission control centre was once alive with the sound of voices and ringing telephones but is now eerily quiet .","RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire was a bustling strategic base for the U.S. Air Force during the Cold War .

"By . Martin Robinson . Police have shot a 43-year-old man during an armed siege in Liverpool today after he allegedly took his wife hostage at gunpoint before holding a knife to her throat. Merseyside Police officers threw smoke bombs into the house and kicked down the door after a 40-minute stand-off where 'at least 10 shots were fired', witnesses said. Two children, seven and 11, fled the property in Shellingford Road, Dovecot, and took refuge at a neighbour's house, an eyewitness said.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It has famously been said that when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life. And now an online walking tour has launched a map that charts the scientific history of the fascinating city - taking in the sites where the most revolutionary scientific experiments were conducted. The map covers five centuries of innovation, from alchemy to the exact site that the atomic bomb is thought to have been conceived. Scroll down for interactive map . Discoveries mapped: The map covers five centuries of innovation, from alchemy in Mortlake, suburban West London to the exact site that the atomic bomb is believed to have been conceived in Bloomsbury . It was created by San Francisco-based Stamen Design, using data from the Open Street Map. In around 1550 in Mortlake, West London, the theological adviser to Queen Elizabeth I, John Dee reportedly communicated with an angel. He also tried to create the Philosopher's Stone, dabbled with the occult and published a number of mathematical theories. U.S. Electricity pioneer Benjamin Franklin conducted many dangerous experiments at his lodgings in Craven Street on London's Embankment near the Thames. The map says that it was there that he designed a lightning rod to minimise damage to buildings including St Paul's Cathedral, which earned him a Fellowship at the Royal Society in 1756. Making medical history: At St Thomas’ Hospital on the South Bank (marked on the map left), . renowned surgeon Astley Cooper (pictured right) manually closed off the aorta to prevent . an aneurysm in 1817. While it was the first time the theory was put into practice, the patient dies just 40 hours after the operation . At St Thomas’ Hospital on the South Bank, renowned surgeon Astley Cooper manually closed off the aorta to prevent an aneurysm in 1817. He cut into a dying man's abdomen without anaesthetic and found his aorta by feel alone, before tying it off in front of onlookers and saving the man's life - albeit for just 40 hours. Kensington in West London was the setting for a couple of railway experiments. In 1840 brothers Jacob and Joseph Samuda rented half a mile of the unopened West London Line and demonstrated the world's first atmospheric railway, which used differential air pressure to provide power for propulsion. While the applications of the technology were short lived, their innovation preceded the opening of the London Underground two decades later, which used steam locomotives. The site of an explosive idea: This peaceful park is the final stop of the walking tour. Leafy Russell Square in Bloomsbury was where the bomb that has changed the nature of war forever, was conceived by Leo Szilard when he was crossing the street in 1933 .

It was in a shed in Marylebone in North West London in 1823 that the 'father of the computer', Charles Babbage, invented his Difference Engine - a type of calculator. While the first one was never finished, his theory and the creation of the Difference Engine mark 2, led to the development of  other early computers. The first television was demonstrated at 22 Frith Street, Soho when in 1926 John Logie Baird transmitted live images of his assistant and a ventriloquist’s dummy to 50 people. One year later, he sent pictures between London and Glasgow by telephone cable. And on the final stop of the walking tour, the bomb that has changed the nature of war forever, was conceived by Leo Szilard when crossing the street in leafy Russell Square, Bloomsbury in 1933. The Hungarian mathematics prodigy came up with the idea of the atomic bomb and 'as he crossed the street, time cracked open before him and he saw a way to the future, death into the world and all our woes - the shape of things to come,' his biographer, Richard Rhodes wrote.

"By . Wills Robinson . Sinead Dewar, 25, was jailed after a vicious attack which left Jessica Moran, 34, with multiple head injuries after attacking her with a stiletto heel . A strip club dancer who stamped on a colleague’s face with her 6in stiletto heel after arguing over a glass of wine has been jailed. Sinead Dewar, 25, left 34-year-old Jessica Moran in 'continual pain' from her injuries after punching her five times in the face at Room 32 in Preston, Lancashire. She then repeatedly kicked and stamped on the victim's head as she tried to crawl away. Preston Crown Court heard that Ms Moran suffered a fractured cheekbone and eye socket following the attack in the dancers’ changing area of the club. Dewar launched the 'sustained attack' after Ms Moran, who was working her first shift at the venue, confronted her about a glass of wine she claimed was taken before she finished drinking it. The court heard that the argument broke out in the customer area of the bar on June 28 last year. The head dancer stepped in and said they should sort things out away from the customers. Downstairs in the changing area, Dewar launched the vicious attack with a 6in pair of cream stiletto heels. Ms Moran, who has been forced to leave her job since the attack, now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as nightmares and anxiety attacks. Jailing Dewar, Judge Niclas Parry said: 'You used persistent and repeated violence using a very dangerous form of footwear. 'She asked if you had taken her glass of wine and an argument flared up. You punched her in the nose and, having been shaken by that, you punched her again, causing her nose to bleed. Dewar, pictured arriving at Preston Crown Court, punched Ms Moran in the face five times before repeatedly kicking her and stamping on her head . The 'sustained' attack took place at Room 32 in Preston, Lancashire, after a row erupted over a glass of wine . 'You threw four or five punches and you gripped her by the neck as you punched her in the face. 'You proceeded to kick and stamp on her several times. With the heel, you stamped on her head many, many times. 'She . tried to crawl away and you stamped on the back of her legs. You used . your foot and for the most part a very large stiletto heel.' He added: 'Her left eye was completely closed up from the abrasions. It took four days before she could open it. 'She . cried through the night and she was terrified that in the morning her . infant son would wake to see the state you had left her in. Dewar cried in the dock at Preston Crown Court as she was jailed for 16 months . 'Her son saw her the the following day and saw her face which was injured by you. 'Once a bubbly person, she now suffers flashbacks and anxiety attacks. She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and struggles sleeping.' Sarah Johnston, prosecuting, told the court that the attack on Ms Moran, who now has a constant shadow in her left eye, has also impacted upon Ms Moran’s family and her social life. Dewar, who suffers from Asperger syndrome, denied the offence but was convicted by a jury of causing actual bodily harm in March this year. Dewar, from Blackpool, Lancashire, cried in the dock as she was jailed for 16 months.","Sinead Dewar, 25, left Jessica Moran, 34, in 'continual pain' after attack .

Now the Omega watch he was wearing at the time is up for auction – and it still shows the time when the brave serviceman died. Spitfire pilot Les Ricalton, left, was killed at 3.40pm after being shot down over Kent in on October 17, 1940. Frozen in time, the Omega watch he was wearing, that was recovered from the crash site, still shows the exact time he died . The Flying Officer was just 26 when his Spitfire was gunned down near Hollingbourne in Kent at exactly 3.40pm. Frozen in time having stopped ticking at that very moment, his watch is now expected to fetch as much as £4,000 when it goes under the hammer with other items including letters, photos, an identity card and a brass Spitfire model. Mr Ricalton was born on January 21, 1914 in Hazelrigg, Northumberland and joined the RAF in 1938. Other items going under the hammer at auction include the pilot's identity card, left, a brass model of a Spitfire, centre, and a number of photographs . Two years later, the German attack in the West was resulting in heavy losses within Battle squadrons. In July 1940 Fighter Command sought volunteers from other commands to replace the losses incurred in France and Mr Ricalton bravelycame forward. His squadron moved to Coltishall on September 9 and Ricalton engaged the enemy for the first time just days later. On October 17, the same squadron was scrambled to intercept a high-level raid and 11 of their Spitfires climbed to 26,000 feet, keeping up-sun from a wave of German aircraft.

"By . Steph Cockroft . The new Coldplay album has become the fastest-selling UK album of the year, after the band shunned Spotify and signed an exclusive deal with iTunes operator Apple. Ghost Stories - which documents Chris Martin’s famous 'conscious uncoupling' from Gwyneth Paltrow - sold 106,000 copies in its first two days of release, in what has been hailed as a victory for Apple in the future of digital music. According to experts, sales were boosted by Coldplay’s decision to withhold the record from streaming services such as Spotify, where music can be played for free. Chris Martin's band Coldplay, show here performing at an iTunes festival in March, has sold 106,000 copies of its new album . Ghost Stories after signing an exclusive deal with iTunes provider Apple . Although Spotify now has 10m subscribers and 40m users (right), artists say the royalties paid by the streaming service are low - which has led to more artists and bands signing exclusively with iTunes (left) Instead, Coldplay signed exclusively with the Apple-owned music download service, in a bid to increase the sales of full-price albums. The band even debuted the album at a special iTunes concert in March, before allowing the service to stream the record for one week before its official release. While individual singles have been made . available on Spotify - and the entire album could appear on the service . within the next four months - industry experts say the exclusive deal with Apple is likely to have helped sales, according to The Independent. The album . has also been released two months after Chris Martin famously announced he . was 'consciously uncoupling' from his 41-year-old wife, around the time . they went on a family holiday in the Bahamas - something which could . have also had an impact. Gwyneth . and the Coldplay frontman, who have two children, told fans in March that they had come to the conclusion that 'while we love each . other very much we will remain separate'. Coldplay's . decision to release the album through iTunes comes after Beyoncé sold a . record 1m downloads in the first week after giving iTunes an exclusive . release of her self-titled album last year. The album is said to document the 'conscious uncoupling' of the Coldplay . frontman and actress Gwyneth Paltrow, 41, which the pair announced in . March . Although the interest in the couple's 'uncoupling' could be a factor behind the high sales, some say Coldplay's decision to withhold the album from streaming services such as Spotify are the reason for the impressive sales in the first two days of release . Beyoncé sold a record number of albums last year after she also gave the release of her self-titled album to iTunes . The Black Keys is another band which has opted to withhold its album from Spotify, amid criticism that the royalties the streaming service pays are low. But despite the increasing trend for major artists to sign with iTunes, download sales are still in decline. With Spotify now having 10m subscribers and 40m users, download sales fell 2.1 per cent last year. And Ghost Stories’ opening day sales were still 15 per cent lower than the . 2011 record Mylo Xyloto - the last album to be released by Coldplay. It means it is unlikely the latest Coldplay album, despite its early success, will match the . 464,471 copies which the X&Y album sold during its first week . in 2005. After the deal was struck, Spotify published a message to Coldplay fans saying: 'The artist or their representatives have decided not to release this album on Spotify. We are working on it and hope they will change their mind soon.' Apple is expected to launch its own streaming service after it bought Beats Electronics - the headphones maker co-founded by Dr Dre - which had already begun signing up customers to a new programme. But industry insiders said YouTube, which is owned by Google, still provides a huge challenge to both Apple and Spotify. On YouTube, Ghost Stories - and most other albums - can be streamed for free with a minimum payments to copyright holders.","Band's album Ghost Stories has become fastest-selling UK album this year .

"By . Julian Robinson . A series of high profile speakers have cancelled their talks at the Oxford Union as the historic debating society’s president faces rape allegations. The world's top law enforcer, Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble, was due to address the Oxford Union on May 30, but sent a letter saying he will cancel after leader Ben Sullivan, 21, was arrested on suspicion of rape and attempted rape this month. Other speakers to pull out include David Mepham, UK Director of Human Rights Watch and Julie Meyer, the American entrepreneur and judge on the BBC’s Dragon’s Den. Ben Sullivan, pictured, was arrested on suspicion of rape and attempted rape earlier this month . It comes after Mr Sullivan, a wealthy banker’s son, made a return to office last week following his arrest - sparking resignation calls from some rank and file members. In the letter, American Mr Noble said: 'What should the head of a society like the Oxford Union do if he is under investigation for rape and attempted rape? 'In my view, he should be guided by the best interests of his organisation. He should not be guided by his own interests. 'In this case my advice to Ben Sullivan would be either to resign or take a leave of absence until the criminal investigation has been completed. 'Interpol has attempted to contact the Oxford Union since reports of the allegations against Ben Sullivan first surfaced. We have received no response to our inquiries. 'Consequently I have decided to withdraw my participation as a speaker at the Oxford Union on Friday 30 May 2014.' Julie Meyer, pictured left, the American entrepreneur and judge on the BBC's Dragon's Den has called off her planned Oxford Union talk while Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble, right, was due to address the Oxford Union on May 30, but sent a letter saying he will cancel . Mr Sullivan was arrested in his rooms at Christ Church College and bailed to return to police on June 18. He has not been charged with any offence. He was initially replaced by acting president Mayank Banjaree, 21, but returned to chair a debate last Thursday. He made a defiant speech to members protesting his innocence, and said: 'Unfortunately I am not able to give any detailed comment on what is now an ongoing police investigation. 'As you may be aware no charges have been brought against me and I have the utmost faith in the police and Crown Prosecution Service and the British legal system as a whole. I know that sooner or later the truth will prevail and justice will be served.' Mr . Sullivan, from Kensington, London, is due to complete his stint as . president at the end of the academic term and is now expected to . continue in his presidential duties until he answers bail next month.

The letter says: 'We are writing this open letter, as members and former speakers at the Oxford Union, and members of the university community, to express our concern at the ongoing situation at the society. 'Last week, President Ben Sullivan returned to his role as President of the Union following his arrest earlier this month. This is despite being under ongoing investigation by the police for rape and attempted rape. 'Though he has not been charged, he remains on bail.

'The suspect targeted his victim carefully, choosing someone who was a bit the worse for wear after a night out, alone and smartly dressed,' said Investigating officer Detective constable Michael Heaney. 'The method he uses is not something we have seen before in this area and is a concern. 'Had the suspect applied more pressure the victim could have been far more seriously injured.

"By . Jill Reilly . Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and ordered to pay back $17.6m. The graft case against the 86-year-old Mubarak, who is kept in custody at a military hospital, is one of two against the former president who was ousted in a popular uprising in 2011 after nearly three decades in power. He is being retried over the killings of hundreds of protesters during the uprising. Scroll down for video . Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and ordered to pay back $17.6m . The graft case against the 86-year-old Mubarak, who is kept in custody at a military hospital, is one of two against the former president who was ousted in a popular uprising in 2011 after nearly three decades in power . Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were also convicted Wednesday of graft and sentenced to four years in prison each in the same case. The three Mubaraks were convicted of charges that they $17.6m worth of state funds in over a decade toward the end of Hosni Mubarak's rule. The funds were meant for renovating and maintaining presidential palaces but were instead spent on upgrading the family's private residences. Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were also convicted Wednesday of graft and sentenced to four years in prison each in the same case. Pictured: The pair attending court in 2012 . Mubarak, 86, was thrust into office when Islamists gunned down his predecessor Anwar Sadat at a military parade in 1981. The burly former air force commander proved a far more durable leader than anyone imagined at the time - he was ousted in 2011. He is married to Suzanne, who is half-British and during his nearly 30 year time in power he survived six assassination attempts. But over the years his health began to fail - it was reported he was suffering from heart problems. Following mass protests in Cairo and other cities, Mr . Mubarak announced he had decided not to stand for re-election later that . year. But the protests continued on 10 February he announced he would remain president, but was handing over his powers. The following day Vice-President Omar Suleiman announced Mr Mubarak was stepping down and the country would be ruled by the military's supreme council. In June 2012 he was found guilty of failing to stop the killing of more than 900 protesters during the 18-day revolt against his rule and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was overturned in January 2013. That was appealed by prosecutors, and a retrial began in April 2013. He was released in August last year pending his graft trial, but was kept at a military hospital in a suburb south of Cairo. Since his ouster, Mubarak's supporters have released conflicting details about his health, including that he suffered a stroke, a heart attack and at times went into a coma. His wife has been living in Cairo and keeping a low-profile, occasionally visiting Mubarak and their two sons in prison. Hosni Mubarak 'had an obligation to . restrain himself and his sons from stealing state funds ... but instead, . he gave himself and his sons license to embezzle them,' Judge Osama . Shaheen said as he handed down the verdict. The three Mubaraks were also fined 21.1 million Egyptian pounds ($2.9 million). They were also ordered to reimburse 125 million Egyptian pounds ($17.6 million) to the state treasury. They have the right to appeal their conviction before a higher court. The Mubaraks had returned around 120 million Egyptian pounds to the state in connection with this case, but the proceedings against them continued. Four other defendants in the case were acquitted. Mubarak, who turned 86 this month, attended Wednesday's hearing in a suit and tie. His two sons wore white prison uniforms. They . have all been held in custody since 2011, but only time in custody in . connection with this case - about a year since the embezzlement charges . were raised - will be deducted from the sentences. Under . Egyptian law, maximum sentences for embezzlement vary depending on the . nature of the crime, but 15 years' imprisonment is not uncommon.

Given his poor health, Mubarak is likely to serve his sentence in the hospital. Mubarak's sons are also being retried on separate graft charges.

"By . Charlotte Kemp . Splashed out on a new sheer summer dress? Dug out those white trousers for the weekend? Then you, like me, risk the scourge of sunshine dressing: the dreaded Visible Panty Line (VPL). While winter woollies and thick fabrics hide all manner of underwear sins, your summer wardrobe is another matter entirely. VPL was cited as Sixties supermodel Twiggy’s pet hate this week, when she advised women of a certain age to spend as much time looking in a rear view mirror before leaving the house, as they do in their bathroom one. But how do you banish VPL? The good news is there’s an astonishing array of ‘invisible’ knickers said to be undetectable beneath even the flimsiest of clothing. Summer scourge: Charlotte isn't loving this unsightly case of VPL . But are these new breed of second skin undies really as effective as they are claimed to be?I road-tested 12 pairs ranging from £3 to £75 under a sheer frock and a pair of tight white trousers to find out which work and which don’t. Florence and Fred No VPL Nude Knickers, £3, tesco.com . These . are a hipster style with a generous cut where it counts across the . rear. The material has been laser cut so there are no seams, meaning the . knickers sit flat against the skin. The lace panel might show up under . some dresses but was totally invisible under light-coloured trousers. Great value, too — I’m stocking up. SCORE: 5/5 . Sloggi Invisible Light Hipster in camel, £9, sockshop.co.uk . I tried the shimmery caramel shade, which was a little dark for my skin tone but would look very natural against tanned skin. These . have laser cut, scalloped edges at the back to avoid the seams that can . give that tell-tale line under clothes and there’s no label to get in . the way either — the washing instructions are printed on the fabric . instead. But they are let down by the vertical back seam visible beneath . the sheer dress. Quite . tight and high cut at the back so I had to go up a size to a size 12 to . stop them digging in and  creating two bottoms. SCORE: 3/5 . M&S cotton No VPL Brazilian with stretch, £6, marksandspencer.com . Great . everyday knickers if you are more of a J-Lo than a Gwyneth in the rump . stakes. The lace at the back gives discreet, reassuring coverage without . leaving a line. These comfy smalls were totally invisible under white . trousers, though you could see a lacy shadow in places beneath the . dress. They were the most flattering by far, and cotton, too, so cool . for summer. SCORE: 4.5/5 . Primark Secret Possessions seam-free full briefs, £5 for three, primark.com . Bridget Jones, . eat your heart out. These are definitely in the passion killer category . of big pants. But they are seamless and label-free so they give a . smooth finish and are very soft — and reassuring if you like a high-cut . style that covers the tummy. The leg trim could be seen beneath the . sheer dress, but there was no VPL under the white trousers. SCORE: 3/5 . Ultimo Invisible Thong, £10, ultimo.co.uk . Avoid . these teeny tiny knickers unless you have a teeny tiny bottom. There . are no seams but the fabric was so tight fitting, even in a larger size, . it pressed against my skin leaving unsightly bulges. These smallest of . smalls confirmed all my worst fears about wearing a thong at my age. They were tight, hideously unflattering and within minutes I felt like I . was being spliced with cheesewire. SCORE: 1/5 . Elle Macpherson Dentelle Culotte Brief, £25, houseoffraser.co.uk . These . are white with pale pink trim. The back panel is made in a very fine, . seamless netting which doesn’t cling and they are generously cut so that . you feel you are wearing something substantial rather than simply . wobbling about unsupported. Sadly, the white fabric showed up beneath . the sheer dress, but they’re great for jeans. SCORE: 4/5 . Triumph Body Make Up Lace Tai Brief, £15, triumph.com . A pretty . design that’s less skimpy than most and therefore much more flattering. Comfy, too. Smooth across the bottom but the seams at the leg are quite . bulky and so sadly were still visible beneath the white cropped . trousers as well as under my favourite cream dress, which was . disappointing. Had an unsightly label, too, that I had to cut out. SCORE: 2.5/5 . Studio La Perla Invisible Brief, £24, houseoffraser.co.uk . These . come in a dark nude shade that would best suit darker skin tones. Quite . skimpy on, so not great for containing curves and I found they rode up . at the back when worn. I had no lines across the bottom cheeks but the . sides were quite narrow, and, in my usual size, dug in to my hips . creating unsightly bulges. Bafflingly, they’re also hand-wash only. SCORE: 1.5/5 . Victoria’s Secret No-Show Seamless Thong, £11 . Low . cut at the front so there’s the risk of a muffin overspill, but the . soft, stretchy fabric mercifully doesn’t dig into love handles at the . back or sides so they are not too torturous to wear. They’re . great under white jeans, and invisible under the dress, but they won’t . protect against cheek-wobble under a floaty skirt, so are only for the . brave/under-30s/flat-bottomed. SCORE: 4.5/5 . Next No VPL shorts, £12 for a three-pack . These . are not attractive. They look like hot pants and that’s only a good . thing if you are Kylie Minogue. But they did prove to be invisible under . the sheer dress and gave some coverage and wobble-protection. Sadly let . down by the back seam and label, which could be seen under the white . trousers. SCORE: 4.5/5 . Wolford Tulle Control Shorts, £75, wolford.com . These . transparent control shorts are not at all pretty, but they were totally . invisible under both the sheer dresses and the white trousers, and as . an added bonus they kept all my wobbly bits in place. There are no seams . so they don’t dig in to the upper thigh or waist. Just . don’t wear them on a windy day or your skirt might flap up and reveal . your secret. They’re seriously expensive, but could prove an . indispensable addition to your summer armoury if you need a little extra . help. SCORE: 5/5 . Marks and Spencer Waist Cincher Knickers With No VPL, £19.50, marksandspencer.com . Tummy . control pants can be the worst for digging in across the bottom, but . these big beauties have seamless mesh panels at the top of the thigh and . across the rear so that they lie flat against the skin and are . completely invisible.

"By . Steph Cockroft . The owners of a rare antique steam engine could face a £100,000 repair bill after the machine slipped off the back of a lorry and was badly damaged. The 21-tonne Fowler engine, named the 'Giant Panther', which was made in 1917, missed an electric pylon by inches after falling off the low loader as it went around a blind bend. The ploughing engine's flywheel, boiler and steering mechanism were damaged in the accident in Crays Hill, Billericay, Essex. The 21-tonne steam engine Giant Panther, which dates back to 1917, was . badly damaged after falling from the back of a lorry as it drove around a blind corner in Billericay, . Essex . The engine's flywheel, boiler and steering were damaged in the crash and could cost up . to £100,000 to repair, according to Barleylands Farm, which owns the . vehicle . The lorry was driving the engine back from the Essex Young Farmers' Country Show, near Chelmsford, where it had made its first appearance since . being lovingly restored by the farm . Barleylands Farm, which owns the ploughing engine, had spent five years restoring the historic engine to working condition before the crash. The farm owners also restored its sister engine, The Giant Tiger, also dating back to 1917, which works in tandem with the Giant Panther. Spokesman Jenny Sparkes told MailOnline that the steam engine - which must work in a pair - arrived back to the farm this morning and a mechanic was starting repair work today. She said: 'The engine has pride of place in our show every year. We don't know the exact damage but we are expecting to look at around £100,000. 'The plan is to repair it if we can and we are hoping to have it fixed by the time of the Essex County Show, in September. 'The engines work in a pair so must go together. Although there are more ploughing machines around, it is so rare to get the exact pair so we really hope we can get it working again.' The crash took place around 7.30pm, but the machine was not recovered . for another five hours because those removing it had to be so careful not to do further damage to the antique model . The drama . unfolded on Sunday evening as the steam engine was being brought back . from the Essex Young Farmers' Country Show, near Chelmsford, where it . made its first appearance since being restored. After the crash, four cranes worked through the night to recover the steam engine. Because of its age, recovery workers had to treat the machine delicately to ensure there was no further damage. It was finally moved at 1.30am the following morning. Mike Kirby, 59, who lives close to where the accident took place, told The Brentwood Gazette: 'I was standing in the lounge looking out the window and saw it coming round the corner. 'The next minute there was a crash and it fell off. I came straight out and it was steaming. The steam engine is one of two ploughing engines owned by the farm which owners hope will make an appearance at the Essex County Show in . September . The rare vehicle works in tandem with its sister engine, The Giant Tiger, which has also been restored by the farm. Both vehicles work to plough a field, one pulling from the left and the other pulling from the right . The Giant Panther is one of the ploughing machines famously created by John Fowler in Leeds. There are still around 3,000 Fowler machines in preservation. Of these, it is believed a few hundreds are ploughing engines, although it is believed there are just a handful that were also made in 1917. The two-gear engine, labelled as the 14729, works in tandem with its sister engine The Giant Tiger, which also dates back to 1917 and is labelled as the 14728. Located on either side of a field, the engines are designed to pull a plough, or a scoop on a cable, backwards and forwards across a paddock, travelling at around 4mph. The engines are identical . except that one engine pulled the rope from the right and the other from . the left. The paired engine system was developed . because the heavy traction engines caused the soil to be heavily compressed if driven across a paddock pulling a plough. 'I was concerned someone was hurt so I went to see if the driver was okay and he was alright. A few people called 999 to get the police out. 'It was a nightmare - they had four really big cranes and the road blocked off. It was very lucky that no one was on the verge and that it didn’t take any power lines down with it. 'Everyone was down here – no less than 50 people with the road closed off.' As well as damage to the vehicle, the kerb, a chevron sign and the grass verge were all damaged. Passerby David De’ath of Queens Park, Billericay, said: 'It will have done a lot of damage to the engine. Luckily it fell onto the grass verge rather than the road and no one was walking on it.' A police spokesman said: 'Officers attended and assisted with traffic management. The road was subsequently closed completely while the steam engine was recovered. It was fully reopened at 1.30am. 'Essex Highways were also notified about the incident due to suspected damage to the road surface.'","The 21-tonne engine, built in 1917, fell from the lorry in Billericay, Essex .

A quick-thinking four-year-old boy has been hailed a ‘hero’ after saving his little sister from drowning when he found her floating in a 5ft deep garden pond. Jamie Isherwood screamed for help when he found his two-year-old sister Amelia floating under the surface of the fish pond at their grandparent’s house in Atherton, Greater Manchester. The youngsters’ mother Natalie Cope, 25, said the toddler wandered off while relatives enjoyed a barbecue in the front garden at the weekend. She said: ‘We had locked the patio door but left the side gate unsecured when I took the dog for a walk with my mum and Amelia must have wandered into the back garden. ‘We had just arrived back when I heard Jamie screaming hysterically. I followed him and saw Amelia submerged and lying face-up. ‘I was screaming but pulled her out, bent her over and gave her a good whack on the back and she coughed. She had swallowed loads of water.’ Ms Cope’s father Gary and her sister-in-law Suzanne Churnside helped resuscitate the youngster and a neighbour with nursing experience took over until paramedics arrived. She was taken to Royal Bolton Hospital, Greater Manchester. where she was placed in the high dependency unit and constantly monitored until she was declared well enough to return home on Monday afternoon.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . From flower-filled meadows to scenic lakes and quaint villages, the photos captured the sights of a newlywed couple as they travelled across the east coast of England on the eve of World War Two. Now, the astonishing set of images documenting Denys and Margaret Gardiner's honeymoon in August 1939 has been recreated in the present day. And although the pictures were taken 75 years apart, a remarkable number of things still appear the same. Then: This remarkable colour photo shows Denys and Margaret Gardiner's visit to Brayford Pool in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, during their honeymoon in August 1939 . Now: In a photo taken in present day, Brayford Pool features the same towering cathedral, scenic views and raised platform, but with a higher number of swans . Surprisingly similar: One honeymoon photo, captured by Mr Gardiner's cousin Eldred, shows a man in a cap riding his bicycle down Lincoln High Street (left). Incredibly, its present day version (right) also features a cathedral, an array of shops and a cyclist - albeit, with more road markings, better safety gear and vans instead of horses . Remarkable: Boston High Street, in Lincolnshire, cuts a startling . similar scene in both sets of images, with buildings, vehicles and St . Botolph's Church overlooking the murky brown river below. However, time . has seen the red postbox (left) replaced by a parking meter (right), . while the steps to the river have been demolished entirely . Popular: Meanwhile, the River Thames in London was seemingly a popular sight for passersby in August 1939 - just one month before the start of the Second World War . Captial: The British capital looks similar in present day, with Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament in the background. But its new additions include the London Eye . Couple: The old photos captured the sights of the newlywed couple as they travelled across the east coast of England on the eve of World War Two. Above, the wedding of Denys Gardiner, born 1916, and Margaret, born 1913, at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Finchley Road, Hampstead, London, on April 15, 1939 . One honeymoon photo, captured by Mr Gardiner's cousin Eldred, shows a man in a cap riding his bicycle down Lincoln High Street in Lincolnshire. Incredibly, its present day version features the same towering cathedral, row of shops and a cyclist - albeit, with more road markings, better safety gear and vans and cars instead of horses. Meanwhile, Boston High Street, also in Lincolnshire, is startlingly similar in both sets of images, with buildings, vehicles and St Botolph's Church overlooking the murky brown river below. However, time has seen the red postbox replaced by a parking meter, while boating enthusiasts can no longer venture into the river via a set of stairs. Well-preserved: One of the best-preserved images in the collection, this photo shows a village sign in Shernborne, Norfolk, which is situated not far from Sandringham . Faded: The photos were only recently uncovered by the couple's grandson, Barney Britton, who is himself a professional photographer, after spending years hidden away in Mrs Gardiner's attic. Mr Britton believes the sign (above) may have been taken down during the war to avoid assisting enemy forces in the event of an invasion . A sun-lit walk: The honeymoon photos were taken as the Gardiners motored through the country in their Morris Eight. Left, Monk Bar in York in 1939 and, right, today . A popular ride: The Morris Eight was extremely popular at the time and its success propelled its manufacturer to become the biggest car company in Britain in the 1940s . Idyllic: In a present day photo, Morston in Norfolk is deserted, picturesque and bathed in a yellow sunset. Mr and Mrs Gardiner visited this spot during their honeymoon . Ready to sail: Just weeks after the couples' 900-mile round trip, the peace and tranquility of the country was to be shattered by the outbreak of the Second World War. Above, a boat is moored on banks of River Thames in London in 1939 . Expensive: A modern white-coloured boat, featuring a British flag, is pictured on the river, 75 years after the original honeymoon photos were taken by Mr Britton . And the River Thames in London seemingly still proves a popular sight for passersby - but with expensive modern ships replacing old sailing boats. Other recreated images include the River Stiffkey in Norfolk, Beverley Minister in East Yorkshire, Monk Bar in York and a quiet residential street in Lavenham, Suffolk. The original honeymoon photos, which were taken as the Gardiners motored through the country in their Morris Eight, show them camping in sun-lit meadows, driving down country roads and relaxing by stunning lakes. Spectacular: Speaking of the photos, Mr Britton told MailOnline: 'I don't remember hearing my grandmother talk about the holiday.' Above, Mr and Mrs Gardiner's car is parked outside a church at upper Sheringham, Norfolk, in August 1939 . Barely a difference: He added: 'But my mother had told me about the pictures due to my interest in photography.' Above, the same church is pictured today . Camping: Mr and Mrs Gardiner are pictured camping in Kelling Heath, Norfolk, during their honeymoon across the east coast of England on the eve of World War Two .

"By . Francesca Chambers . and Associated Press . First Lady Michelle Obama's healthy eating initiatives have been so . unpopular among young people that more than a million students have . stopped buying school lunches. The Agriculture Department set new . standards for what types of foods schools can serve students that have been . phased in over the last three school years in response to Obama's push for healthier school lunches, and even more changes are coming in . 2014. Already, data from the department shows that a total of 1.1 million children abandoned the National School Lunch program between the 2011 and 2013 school years after Obama went to war over what's on their trays. And among students whose meals are not subsidized by the government, the number is even higher - totaling 1.6 million. Not having it: First Lady Michelle Obama's healthy eating initiatives have been so unpopular among young people that more than a million students have stopped buying school lunches . If only Michelle Obama's regs on school lunches were as popular with kids as her dance moves were yesterday during the first-ever White House Talent Show . First Lady Michelle Obama joins the lunch line at Parklawn Elementary School in Alexandria, Virginia on January 25, 2012. Obama made the visit to speak about the United States Department of Agriculture's new nutrition standards for school lunches . In announcing the changes to school lunches in January of 2012, Michelle Obama said that, 'Schools are finding that when they actually offer these healthier . options, kids aren’t just willing to try them, they actually like them. That's the thing, that's the surprising thing. 'I've been . to so many schools across the country where parents see their kids . eating fresh vegetables off the vine, kids they say would never try . anything, but that's the beauty of children — they change,' the First Lady said. But since then many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly. The rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. Schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for whole grains have proven particularly difficult, while some school officials say kids are throwing fruits and vegetables they are required to take in the trash. 'I am talking to the lunch ladies who do all this work and it is thrown in the garbage at the end of the day,' Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt told The Hill. House Republicans are proposing to let . some schools opt out of healthier school lunch and breakfast programs . if they are losing money. A . GOP spending bill for agriculture and food programs released on Monday . would allow schools to apply for temporary waivers if they have a net . loss on school food programs for a six month period. The House Appropriations Committee said in a release that the waiver language is in response to requests from schools. The School Nutrition Association, which represents school nutrition directors and companies that sell food to schools, endorsed the provision on Monday and said that schools need more room to make their own decisions. President Leah Schmidt said the group supports the one-year waiver as a temporary solution until Congress considers renewal of a school foods law that expires in 2015. 'School meal programs need more flexibility to plan menus that increase student consumption of healthy choices while limiting waste,' Schmidt said. The School Nutrition Association says that almost half of school meal programs reported declines in revenue in the 2012-13 school year and 90 percent said food costs were up, leading 1,445 schools to quit the program. Nutrition advocates and other supporters of the rules say it will take some time for schools to adjust and the House proposal is overly broad. Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest says the House Republicans are using a 'hacksaw rather than a scalpel' to try and solve problems some schools are having. Wootan argues that there may be other factors in play such as enrollment or food costs if a lunch program is losing money. 'It's a shame that the House Republicans are taking a step backward and allowing schools to serve more unhealthy food to children,' she said. 'Why would Congress, already maligned for labeling pizza a vegetable — . and I know something about pizza — now seek to weaken federal child . nutrition programs, and through the appropriations process no less, . other than to appease the industry?' Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro said on Tuesday. The latest round of regulations handed down by the government requires public schools to serve more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and less sodium and fat . In announcing changes to school lunches in January of 2012, Michelle Obama said that, 'Schools are finding that when they actually offer these healthier options, kids aren¿t just willing to try them, they actually like them. That's the thing, that's the surprising thing. Congress passed the Healthy, . Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010 just before Democrats lost control of the . House of Representatives. The legislation places stricter regulations on . what foods schools can and cannot serve students at lunch and in . vending machines on school property. Democrats passed the legislation as part of a plug for Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign. Getting kids to eat healthier, and at school in particular, has been a major part of the First Lady's initiative. 'With . more than 32 million children participating in the National School . Lunch Program and more than 12 million participating in the School . Breakfast Program, good nutrition at school is more important than . ever,' the campaign's website says. 'Let’s Move! is committed to providing healthier foods in our nation’s . schools, and encourages all schools to provide school breakfast.' 'The first lady has from day one made the health of our children a top . priority, and that means keeping the pressure on to ensure that school . nutrition standards already implemented by 90 percent of our schools . stay intact,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Tuesday. 'The First Lady and this administration believe that every . decision we make should be guided by sound science and hard evidence, . not politics or special interests, particularly when it comes to the . health of our children.' The . latest round of regulations handed down by the government requires . public schools to serve more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and . less sodium and fat. 'As parents, we try to prepare decent meals, limit how much junk food . our kids eat, and ensure they have a reasonably balanced diet,' Michelle Obama . said at a 2012 event announcing of Department of Agriculture's new guidelines on school lunches. 'And when we're putting in all that effort, the last thing we want . is for our hard work to be undone each day in the school cafeteria.' The Senate Agricultural Appropriations committee's spending bill does not include the GOP's one-year waiver. Instead, Republicans in the Senate will go after new limits on sodium in school lunches and the amount of whole grains schools have to serve. If the GOP's legislation passes in either chambers, it would be a big blow to Michelle Obama and her healthy eating campaign, which has been unpopular among students. 'I blame Michelle Obama,' a student told The Wire earlier this month.'It's great that schools are trying to make . lunches better, they're not doing a very good job of it. 'Starving kids . at school isn't exactly a way to (get) kids' obesity down,' the student said. The new rules are already showing wear and tear as student dissatisfaction with school meals rises. On Tuesday the Department of Agriculture announced a two-year waiver of its own for schools having trouble meeting new regulations on whole-grains. American public school students sick of the smaller portions and healthier offerings they get at lunch thanks to Michelle Obama's anti-obesity initiatives are sounding off on social media . Some students who less than thrilled about the new guidelines are blaming Michelle Obama directly for their unappetizing school lunches .","In 2010 Congress passed the Healthy, .

"By . Ashley Collman . and Jessica Jerreat . A mother who volunteered at the prom where a 17-year-old girl reported being 'ogled' by the dad chaperones has come out to defend the decision to kick her out of the dance. A Virginia teen named Clare made headlines earlier this month when she wrote a scathing blog post about being ordered to leave the Richmond Homeschool Prom because of her provocative dress and dancing. In the post on her sister's blog, Clare wrote that her skirt was within regulation, falling below her fingertips, and that she wasn't even dancing when she was asked to leave. But chaperone Ann Duncan says she saw Clare at the prom, and contested her statements that the dress was an appropriate length and that the dads were staring. Scroll down for video . The other side of the story: Virginia mother Ann Duncan volunteered at the same prom that 17-year-old Clare was kicked out of and says the girl's dress was inappropriate. She also says there's no way to know if the chaperone dads were 'ogling' Night ruined: Virginia teen Clare was kicked out of the Richmond Homeschool Prom when a female chaperone said her dress was too short and her dancing too provocative . Not ok: In a blog post, Clare wrote that her dress was regulation length but Ms Duncan says the dress rode up and became too short . She says the dress may have been the right length when Clare arrived, but that the outfit's spandex fabric caused it to ride up. 'It was right below her butt cheeks by the time I saw her,' Ms Duncan told WTVR. While Ms Duncan says she didn't see Clare dance, her comments that the dads were gathered on a balcony staring at her are unlikely. 'It was very crowded,' Ms Duncan said. 'There were 500 kids there, so to be able to even say what they were looking at would be really difficult.' But Clare is standing behind her blog post, and released a video on Monday along with her date to speak more about the prom-gone-wrong. Same story: Clare and her date posted a video on Monday, standing by their statements that they were unfairly kicked out of prom while demanding a refund . We want our money: Clare, her date, and the rest of their prom group are still waiting to get refunds for their $25 tickets . 'When the lady kicked me out, they said the dads had complained about my dancing and that meant that they had to have been watching me,' Clare said. Clare recounted the whole night in her original post, writing that she was looking forward to going to prom and became especially excited when she found the perfect dress. But, as soon as she walking into the venue, one of the organizers stopped her at the door and said: 'Honey, that dress is too short,' she claimed. Clare was able to prove that the dress fell below her fingertips and was eventually allowed in. 'When I got into the ballroom I laughed, because I was surrounded by girls in much shorter dresses then me.' Clare said. A short while later, as the teenager chatted to her friends and prom date while swaying to the music, she said she noticed a group of fathers staring at her from a balcony. 'We were also a little grossed out by all the dads on the balcony above the dance floor, ogling and talking amongst themselves,' she said. It was at that point that one of the organizers approached Clare again and asked to speak to her in private. '[She] told me that some of the dads who were chaperoning had complained that my dancing was too provocative, and that I was going to cause the young men at the prom to think impure thoughts,' Clare claimed. Big night: The prom for home school students was being held at the Shady Grove Methodist church in Virginia . The teenager said that despite trying to tell the woman that she and her friends hadn't even been dancing, she was told again that her dress was too short and she would have to leave. Her concerned friends tried to intervene in the conversation, and say they hadn't even been dancing, but they were told the situation 'was none of their business'. Clare's date also tried to explain that because the group had arrived together, if she was made to leave they would all have to go. When the friends asked if they would be refunded for a dance they had spent less than half an hour at, they were told only Clare would be given a refund. As she was being escorted, crying, from the venue, Clare says she asked the security guard what he made of the situation. 'I asked the security guy if my dress was compliant with the dress code and if he had noticed any inappropriateness in my behavior and he said he didn’t think I did anything to get kicked out but it wasn’t his call,' Clare wrote. 'We walked out of the prom, frustrated and angry and feeling very disrespected and violated,' Clare said, admitting that in a moment of immaturity they had shouted profanities. Clare and her prom group are still waiting on a promised refund for their $25 dollar tickets.","Virginia teen named Clare wrote a blog post about 'wrongfully' getting kicked out of prom earlier this month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . More than 60 Labour MPs are employing staff on zero hours contracts despite the party’s campaign against them. Labour leader Ed Miliband has repeatedly hit out at the growing use by employers of ‘exploitative’ contracts that offer staff no guarantee of any work. But figures produced by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority reveal that MPs employ 151 staff on zero hours contracts. Labour leader Ed Miliband campaigns against zero hour contracts despite his MPS employing workers on them . Of these, 62 are employed by Labour MPs, 77 by Conservatives, five by Liberal Democrats and seven by independents and the minor parties. Mr Miliband was challenged over the figures yesterday as he gave a round of interviews about low pay. He told BBC Radio Four’s Today programme: ‘I would be surprised by that, but what we have got to do is set the right framework in law.’ The Labour leader yesterday prompted fresh speculation he has had voice training to improve his public image. Ed Miliband, who is known for his nasal drone, appeared to have a slower and softer voice as he toured studios to promote his policy on the minimum wage. Lance Price, a former spin doctor for Tony Blair, suggested he was displaying signs of media training. He said: ‘Much improved delivery from Ed Miliband – calmer, no longer pleading. That training is working.’ But a Labour source said it was ‘not the case’ he has had voice coaching. Steve Turner, of the Unite union, said it was wrong for Labour MPs to employ staff on zero hours contracts. He said said: ‘It will appal ordinary people to discover that the country’s lawmakers are using “hire and fire” contracts. ‘Parliament passed the laws that are supposed to protect pay and conditions – our MPs ought to be upholding them, setting a high standard for employers. 'We are calling on those MPs using zero-hours contracts to move their staff on to secure contracts immediately.’ IPSA did not release the names of MPs using zero hours contracts, so it is not possible to know whether the list includes members of Mr Miliband’s frontbench team. A Labour spokesman said the party had a policy of not using zero hours contracts. But he said it was possible some MPs used the contracts when taking on casual staff. He added: ‘A Labour government will give new legal rights to workers on zero hour contracts, including the right to demand a fixed hours contract when they have worked regular hours over six months with the same employer.'","Figures produced by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority reveal that MPs employ 151 staff on zero hours contracts .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Labour leader Ed Miliband today promised to end the 'terrible scandal' of low pay by linking the minimum wage to average earnings. But the move threatened to backfire after the Tories highlighted official figures which suggested the minimum wage would be 20p lower today if the policy had been introduced in 2010 when they took over. Business Minister Matthew Hancock claimed the minimum wage had 'never been higher' as a proportion of wages, suggesting that Labour's proposal would hit low earners in the pocket. Labour Leader Ed Miliband unveiled his minimum wage proposal in a speech at the Bloxwich Leisure Centre in Walsall today . Labour rejected the claim - as seperate analysis said the national minimum wage could be worth more than 60p an hour for 5.2 million people if it was set at 60 per cent of average take home pay. Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Britain had 'much, much further to go' to end poverty pay. He said increasing the minimum wage as part of a 'national mission' for the Labour party. The Labour leader said: 'What we’re proposing is the government will set, the next Labour government will set a target for the minimum wage for the five years of the next parliament, set as a proportion of average earnings. 'We want to raise it as a proportion of average earnings compared to where it is now because I believe the minimum wage is too low, I don’t believe we’re doing enough to tackle low pay.' But official figures over the four years since 2010 show that average earnings rose 6.2 per cent according to the Offiice for National Statistics. At the same time, the national minimum wage will have gone up by 9.6 per cent, the low pay commission says. If the Government had linked the minimum wage to average earnings it would have gone up from £5.93 to £6.30 - and not the £6.50 it is today. Ed Miliband unveiled his minimum wage policy to Labour supporters today. In a radio interview this morning he claimed raising low pay would be the next Labour Government's 'mission' Mr Miliband this morning insisted he was not going to set out the exact level he wanted to minimum wage to be - but the Tories insisted his plan to link it to average earnings could hit ordinary workers' pay packets. He said: 'I don’t want to be overly coy, but I don’t want to name a figure today because we precisely want to get this right. 'What we need is something which is a much clearer aim for a parliament and it will be the Low Pay Commission’s job to meet that target and I think that’s the right thing to do for our country. 'We can carry on as we are, or we can say this isn’t good enough and we’ve got to change and we’ve got to build a higher wage, higher skill economy with higher productivity and the minimum wage is an essential part of that.' Under the Labour leader's plans a five-year target would be set in 2015 by the new Government, with the independent Low Pay Commission left to decide how best to implement it. The minimum wage is currently £6.31 for adults, but less for younger people and apprentices, and is due to rise to £6.50 this year. One suggestion is that Labour would raise the minimum hourly rate to 60 per cent of median earnings, which would see it rise to around £7.14. Explaining the minimum wage . Mr Miliband said: 'I want people to be . in no doubt - we are determined, as part of a national mission for the . next Labour government, to tackle the problem of low pay and . substantially raise the minimum wage.' He said his proposal 'gets at what I . think is aterrible scandal in this country, which is that we have still . five million people in low-paid work, unable to make ends meet'. The . Labour leader added: 'The minimum wage has done a good job in tackling . the worst of exploitation, but we’ve got to go further now in tackling . the problem of low pay.' But the plans were attacked by business groups. The CBI's Katja Hall said: ‘The national . minimum wage has been a success in raising wages for the lowest paid . because it's been left to the Low Pay Commission, not politicians, to . set the rate. 'A government proposed target would undermine the Commission’s independence.' The manufacturer's organisation the EEF said: ‘The proposals to overhaul the remit of the Low Pay Commission, including…setting a statutory minimum wage target linked to average earnings is an unnecessary distraction. Its primary objective is to provide an evidence-based judgement on what the National Minimum Wage rates should be.' The British Chambers of Commerce said: ‘There is a clear risk that ahead of next year's general election, politicking around the minimum wage…could lead to unaffordable promises that cost jobs and growth. 'The Low Pay Commission must be allowed to get on with its job and base recommendations on clear economic evidence, not political promises.' And the Institute of Directors said: ‘The minimum wage must not become the subject of a political competition to see who can offer the most, irrespective of what the economy and employers and can afford. 'The Low Pay Commission has done a good job of balancing the rate against inflation, economic growth, productivity and the effect rises would have on small businesses and young people. 'In contrast, setting a target linked to average earnings risks seeming a little simplistic…Any increase to the minimum wage must be timed carefully, and ultimately reducing the tax burden on both employers and employees will help strengthen the position of those in low paid jobs.' Mr Miliband insisted it was not 'anti-business', adding: 'He argued it was the Tories, not Labour, who were seen abroad as a threat to business prospects. 'I’m the person who’s saying we’ve got to stay in Europe, that we’ve got to reform the European Union. 'What’s the biggest threat to prosperity in this country? It’s the potential of a Conservative government after the next election which has Britain turning inwards for two years, deciding whether to exit the European Union.'","Labour would link minimum wage to average earnings to boost low pay .
But minimum wage has risen more than average earnings since last election .
Set to rise to £6.50 but would've been just £6.30 under proposal, say critics .
But if it was pegged at 60% of average earnings it would rise by 60p ."

The four-bedroom Brae Cottage, in Knutsford, Cheshire, was occupied by Sir Henry Royce for nearly ten years from 1898. It was during that time he first met fellow engineer Charles Rolls, who went on to become the other co-founding member of their luxury car manufacturer.

Despite being over 100 years since he left, the home still has a number of features to remind people of its famous owner who lived there when Rolls-Royce was born . Mr Royce would often use the home as a base for his work, testing his quadricycle on the drive and experimenting on inventions in the basement. This photo taken in the early 1900s shows one of his first Rolls-Royce prototypes on the driveway of Brae Cottage . They started working together in 1904 and, two years later, Rolls-Royce was officially founded. Mr Royce would often use the home as a base for his work, testing his quadricycle on the drive and experimenting on inventions in the basement. However, in 1907 when the pair moved the company to Derby, Mr Royce sold his beloved Brae Cottage. Despite being more than 100 years since he left, the home still has a number of features to remind people of its famous former owner. The greenhouse was built by the famous engineer and the home retains its original bathroom. There is also a date stone at the front of the house with his and his wife Minnie Grace’s initials carved in.

British engineer Henry Royce got into the motor industry in 1902 after buying a French-built Decauville, which he was dissatisfied with and wished to improve on. Less than a year later, he had turned his full attention to building the best cars in the world and had designed and built his first engine. His first prototypes took to the road in 1904. It was at this time he met Charles Rolls, an engineer and salesman who sold quality cars in London. In 1906, the two agreed to manufacture a range that would bear the name Rolls-Royce and the soon-to-be successful business was born. The series of two, three, four and six cylinder cars broke the mould for engineering and craftsmanship. In 1907, they launched the Silver Ghost, which completed a 14,371 mile run virtually non-stop to create ‘the best car in the world’ legend. Following success in the motor industry, the company branched into aero engines in 1914 to meet the need in Britain for air power for the First World War, before moving into the civil aviation sector. Charles Rolls tragically died in a plane crash in 1910, while Sir Henry Royce passed away in 1933 at the age of 70. Nowadays Rolls-Royce is owned by BMW and is based in Goodwood, Sussex, where its operations span the civil aerospace, defence, marine and energy sector. The company is directly responsible for two per cent of total UK goods exports and is currently experiencing its best ever period of sales and profits. Rolls-Royce engines power 600 airlines around the world including more than 40 of the top 50. Its engines power more than 5.5million commercial flights a year, making it Europe's largest aircraft engine maker. Among their defence products are fighter jet engines, helicopter engines and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Rolls-Royce has more than 40,000 workers worldwide in 50 countries, including 21,000 in the UK.","Stunning cottage in Knutsford, Cheshire, was owned by co-founder Sir Henry Royce for nearly ten years from 1898 .

"By . Hugo Duncan . A spring spending spree helped British stores achieve their best month of sales growth for a  decade, figures revealed yesterday. Retail sales rose 1.3 per cent last month as the Easter break and supermarket price war persuaded shoppers to splash out, according to the Office for National Statistics. The increase left sales 6.9 per cent higher than April last year – the biggest annual jump since May 2004. Mortgage lending was also on the rise as the housing market continued its dramatic recovery. April this year saw the biggest increase in sales for more than a decade, raising hopes that the economy had finally turned a corner for good but also increasing the concern that the recovery was based on household debt . The Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has warned that the economic recovery is not sustainable at the moment because it is too reliant on consumer spending . Analysts said it put the UK economy on . course for another strong quarter following growth of 0.8 per cent in . the first three months of the year. The . Bank of England welcomed signs that ‘the recovery has become less . fragile’ and said the economy may be even stronger than so far reported. ‘According . to present estimates, output had grown at a little above its historical . average for each of the past four quarters,’ a spokesman said. ‘But . it was possible that, after the usual cycle of data revisions, output . would ultimately prove to have been growing at an even faster rate.’ Experts . believe the economy has finally returned to its pre-recession peak, . having crashed by 7.2 per cent under the last Labour government during . the ‘Great Recession’ of 2008-09. Marks and Spencer chief Marc Bolland this week revealed the High Street giant had suffered its third year in a row of falling profits. But the rest of the retail sector appears to be booming . Household spending has driven the . turnaround over the past  12 months, but manufacturing and business . investment are also growing. The . surge in spending last month – in part driven by Easter – came as the . squeeze on family finances eased thanks to low inflation and higher . wages. Food sales were 6.3 per cent higher than a year earlier – the . best performance since January 2002 – as supermarkets cut prices in a . bid to lure shoppers away from their rivals. Dr . Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at research group IHS . Global Insight, hailed the ‘mightily impressive’ figures, saying: ‘This . bodes very well for GDP growth in the second quarter.’ The . Council of Mortgage Lenders said £16.6billion of home loans were made . last month, up 8 per cent on March and 36 per cent on a year ago. It was . the best April since the financial crisis in 2008. A . separate report, by research group Markit, showed job security is now . at its highest level since it started taking records in February 2009. People . are also more confident about their future finances than they have been . at any time over the past five years, according to the study. Tim . Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: ‘The latest survey highlights . that improving labour market conditions and relatively subdued increases . in living costs are delivering an appreciable overall boost to . household finances.

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron ferociously condemned Ukip last night saying voters had heard enough of its ‘appalling’ views. In the closing days of campaigning for European and local elections, the Prime Minister said Ukip represented the ‘politics of anger’. Decent, hardworking people who were tempted to vote for the anti-European party should think again, he said. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said Ukip leader Nigel Farage's comments on Romanians was 'frankly unpleasant' ‘They are being found out,’ added Mr Cameron in his strongest attack on the party since he took office. ‘Ukip have condemned themselves during this campaign with a succession of pretty unpleasant remarks. The whole country has heard enough to know what sort of party it is.’ The Prime Minister declined to describe Ukip leader Nigel Farage as racist but said his suggestion last week that he would be uncomfortable if Romanians moved next door was ‘frankly unpleasant’. In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Cameron also: . Polls suggest Ukip is on course for a historic victory in Thursday’s elections to the European Parliament, despite weeks of allegations of sexism, homophobia and racism among its candidates. Polls suggest Ukip is on course for a historic victory in Thursday¿s elections to the European Parliament . An Opinium poll for the Mail put Ukip on course to win 31 per cent, ahead of Labour on 29 per cent, the Conservatives on 20 per cent and the Lib Dems tied with the Greens on a miserable 5 per cent. Mr Farage was condemned by politicians from the three main parties after declaring in a radio interview last week that everyone knows ‘the difference’ between Romanians and Germans. Mr Farage’s second wife Kirsten is German. The Ukip leader yesterday attempted to backtrack, saying the vast majority of Romanians were ‘good people’. ‘If I gave the impression... that I was discriminating against Romanians then I apologise certainly for that,’ the Ukip leader said on a campaign visit to Ramsgate. He said people would – rather than should – be concerned about Romanian neighbours. He added: ‘Can we just have an honest appraisal of what has happened to post-communist Romania? Across the whole of the European Union, amongst all 28 member states, 7 per cent of all crime is committed by 240 Romanian gangs.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband last night said Mr Farage was guilty of a racial slur, adding: ‘He is certainly right to say he is sorry.’ Ukip have condemned themselves during this campaign with a succession of pretty unpleasant remarks . - David Cameron . Three prominent Labour figures – Yvette Cooper, Diane Abbott and David Lammy – went further, saying Mr Farage’s remarks were racist. Asked if he would feel uncomfortable with Romanian neighbours, Mr Cameron said: ‘No. What was wrong with that remark is it just branded all people the same because they come from one country. It was an appalling thing to say. ‘They [Ukip] are being found out. During this campaign we have had the most extraordinary succession of statements from Ukip candidates and backers that do tell a story. ‘We’ve had financial backers and candidates saying black people should go back to Africa, that it’s alright to rape your wife.’ The Prime Minister added: ‘I understand there are lots of very hardworking, decent people in this country who are tempted by a vote for Ukip. They want to see the economy recover faster, they want to see action on immigration, they want a welfare system that encourages work properly and they want a say on Europe. ‘I want to deliver all of that. It isn’t necessary to get action on all these things to support Ukip.’ In 2006, as leader of the opposition, Mr Cameron said Ukip contained ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’, but has shied away from such rhetoric since. In an interview with the Mail, Cameron also refused to back an EU exit if he fails to secure looser ties . Mr Cameron suggested it would be vital to prevent Ukip winning the June 5 by-election triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer in Newark. ‘The people of Newark were let down by their MP. This was a very bad scandal. I want them to have the best representation in Parliament,’ the Prime Minister said. Asked if he thought making it clear he would recommend a British exit from the EU unless he got what he wanted would strengthen his hand, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘No I don’t. Judge me by results. A lot of people said “You’ll get nowhere, EU leaders will ignore it”. That’s not what has happened.’ He confirmed he will not quit if the Scots vote to break away from the UK in a referendum on September 18. Even some senior Tories privately suggest Mr Cameron will face calls to go if he is the prime minister who presides over the end of the 300-year-old Union. There was mixed news for the Conservatives in the opinion polls yesterday. One by Populus put them ahead, on 35 per cent to 34 per cent. However another survey, commissioned by pollster and former party donor Lord Ashcroft, put the Tories behind on 29 per cent, with Labour on 35 per cent.","David Cameron said Ukip has condemned itself with unpleasant remarks .

"By . Rebecca Camber, Crime Reporter . The father of Rolf Harris’s grandson split up from the star’s daughter after being told he had abused a schoolgirl, a court heard yesterday. Malcolm Cox, who was in a long-term relationship with the veteran entertainer’s daughter Bindi, said he ripped up a photograph of Harris with his baby son in disgust after hearing he had allegedly sexually assaulted Bindi’s childhood friend. Southwark Crown Court heard that the shocking allegations destroyed his relationship with Bindi, now 50, and ‘immeasurably’ changed his attitude towards  Harris having any access to their son, Marlon, who was six months old at the time. Rolf Harris with daughter, Bindi, and wife, Alwen, today - jurors heard he groped woman as she did his make up . The alleged victim, who cannot be . named for legal reasons, claims Harris, now 84, subjected her to a . 16-year campaign of abuse starting when she was aged 13 during  holidays . and sleepovers with his daughter. For years she kept silent, despite Harris allegedly assaulting her at the age of 15 while his daughter slept just feet away. But . late one evening in 1996, at the TV presenter’s home in Bray, . Berkshire, she dramatically  confided in Bindi and Mr Cox, who had just . become parents. Mr Cox . recalled how Bindi’s friend told him ‘that there had been a sexual . relationship between the two, between Rolf and her, and it had occurred . before the age of 16.’ He added: ‘The inference was that it was an . underage relationship – definitely.’ He told jurors that he believed her allegations. Harris, 84, seen arriving at court with (L-R) his daughter, wife and niece, denies all 12 counts of indecent assault . Prosecuting, Sasha Wass QC asked him how he felt about Harris having contact with Marlon, who  is now 18. Mr Cox said: ‘I carried a photograph in my wallet which was a photo of Marlon and Rolf together and it’s ripped. ‘I have taken the Rolf half away.’ Mr Cox said his ‘rocky’ four- year  relationship with Bindi fell apart, adding: ‘It got really bad at that point.’ He . told jurors that Bindi and her friend stayed up all night discussing . the abuse after the alleged  victim told Bindi that she was just 15 at . the time. Miss Wass asked: . ‘Did Bindi ever tell you about anything (the  victim) had said to her . about Rolf Harris, having sex and her age?’ Mr Cox: ‘Yes.’ Miss Wass: ‘At what age?’ Mr Cox: ‘Fifteen.’ The Australian presenter allegedly assaulted Tonya Lee, now 43, in London when she was 15, jurors heard . Under . cross-examination by Sonia Woodley QC, defending, Mr Cox said his . relationship with Bindi ended ‘acrimoniously’, adding that he had never . been ‘well disposed’ towards Harris. When . Miss Woodley suggested that what had actually been  said was that the . woman had been 18 at the time the relationship started, Mr Cox replied: . ‘That is a complete lie.’ Harris . has admitted having a sexual relationship with the woman and wrote to . her father begging for forgiveness, but he claims it started when she . was 18 and he was 53. Earlier, . the court heard how the children’s TV presenter was dubbed ‘Octopus’ by . make-up artists working for Australian TV because he was ‘all hands’. One . woman, who was 24 at the time, was allegedly groped more than 24 times . in one day by Harris in front of his brother Bruce while he was filming a . show in 1986. The woman said he was ‘obsessed’ with her legs. She later told a supervisor: ‘That dirty old man groped me all day – I’m really p***** off.’ Harris is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, which he denies. The trial continues. Family support: Harris, of Bray, Berkshire, arrived at court with his wife, Alwen, left, and niece, Jenny, right .

"By . Sam Webb . David Gikawa, 39, has been found guilty of murdering Linah Keza, 29, in a brutal stabbing at her east London home . A jealous security guard who stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death after she repeatedly told police she feared he would kill her is facing life behind bars. Linah Keza, 29, of Leyton, east London, had begged for a ‘normal and safe life’ with her young daughter just two days before she was knifed to death by 39-year-old David Gikawa. The talented dancer and model filled out a risk assessment form telling how Gikawa was armed with a sharpened kitchen blade and had boasted about killing any man she went out with. Ms Keza had also drafted an affidavit applying for a restraining order and tried to change her locks. But in the early hours of 31 July last year Gikawa sneaked into her home and knifed her repeatedly in the chest. He was convicted of murder after a two-week trial at the Old Bailey. Officers were called to a number of domestic abuse incidents in the two years before Ms Keza was stabbed. Gikawa threatened to kill the mother of his child a year after they had broken up to stop her being with anyone else. She told how she was a ‘prisoner in my own house’ and believed he was stalking her. During one attack Gikawa dragged his former lover through her flat and threw her to the ground. She told police that he tried to push her head against a scalding radiator before going to the kitchen to get a knife. The court heard David Gikawa had attacked the model and dancer on a number of occasions before he killed her . In the early hours of 31 July last year Gikawa sneaked into Ms Kezah's home in Leyton and knifed her repeatedly in the chest . Gikawa pinned Ms Keza to the floor and forced the blade into her mouth, she reported to police. ‘Tell me you love me or I’ll kill you,’ he shouted at her. ‘I love you, I love you’, the terrified woman screamed as she begged him to let her go. One of Ms Keza’s friends dialled 999 after he abducted her from a club in Manor Park in April 2012. When officers arrived at her home they arrested Gikawa but he was later released without charge. She gave numerous witness statements about the attacks and said she was ‘petrified’ her ex-partner was going to carry out his threats to murder her. Ms Keza came to the UK from Rwanda and met Gikawa in 2009 while living in Wolverhampton . Ms Keza told officers that the abuse was getting worse and that she had nowhere to go because her parents were in Rwanda. She had also drafted an affidavit applying for a restraining order, stating: ‘I am making this application because I believe that I will be at risk of significant harm if the respondent is not ordered to stop immediately. ‘I am petrified of him and I don’t want a life of violence any more. ‘I just want to be able to live a normal and safe life with my daughter.’ Ms Keza came to the UK from Rwanda and met Gikawa in 2009 while living in Wolverhampton. She described the relationship as ‘on and off’ and said it began to go downhill after the birth of their daughter in 2011. Ms Keza wrote in the statement that Gikawa was controlling, possessive and used to drink heavily. ‘The respondent controlled me financially as he had an income and I wasn’t working,’ she said. ‘I had to do everything he said for money and for food. ‘He controlled how I dressed and wouldn’t allow me to wear shorts.’ She continued: ‘He would call me nasty names such as prostitute and said that I couldn’t do anything without him.‘When we would argue he would come very close to my face and shout at me, I became frightened.’ The first outbreak of violence took place on 3 March 2011. Gikawa smothered Ms Keza with a pillow and punched her. ‘He pushed me onto the bed and put a pillow over my head,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t breathe. He began punching the pillow, I thought I was going to die and was petrified.’ Ms Keza managed to call the police and gave an account of what had happened. She told officers that she felt isolated and that her partner was controlling and manipulative.Gikawa was arrested but released the following day. Ms Keza wrote in the statement that Gikawa was controlling, possessive and used to drink heavily . The abuse escalated with the worst incident of violence on 9 April 2012 when he attacked her with a knife. A few days before she was killed Ms Keza changed the lock on her flat. Her brother Ivan Kigenza spoke to her for the last time at 10pm on 30 July last year but she did not mention Gikawa at all. The next morning he got no answer on her phone and went round to her flat to find the police at the scene. ‘I was told she was dead,’ he said. She had made a witness statement to police about Gikawa two days before her death. At around 4.30am on July 31, 2013 he went to the flat and stabbed Ms Keza to death. The killer said that his three sisters and two of his brothers were murdered in front of him in Rwanda during the genocide in the 1990s . Gikawa denied the abuse had taken place and said he ‘never did anything’ to her. He claimed Ms Keza was depressed and had threatened to stab herself. The killer said that his three sisters and two of his brothers were murdered in front of him in Rwanda during the genocide in the 1990s. Judge Michael Topolski told Gikawa: ‘You have been convicted on the clearest evidence of the brutal murder of a wholly innocent woman. ‘There is only but one sentence that I must pass upon you and that is life imprisonment. ‘I also have to determine how many years you must serve before you can even be considered safe to be released into the community. ‘You may take it that that period of time will be very substantial indeed. ‘You will be here at 2pm on Friday to hear the sentence of this court.’ Ms Keza’s family sat quietly as the verdict was announced but broke down in tears outside the court. Judge Topolski also commended the brave actions of Ms Keza’s neighbour Gideon Bello who went to investigate after he heard her screams. ‘I wish to give a public commendation to Gideon Bello for his extraordinary bravery in the circumstances,’ he said. ‘He couldn’t possibly have known what was on the other side of that door.’ Judge Topolski invited Mr Bello to the sentencing and said he will receive a financial reward. Following the killing the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) had launched an investigation into the contact between Miss Keza and police officers. Gikawa, of Leyton, denied but was convicted of murder. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on May 23 at 2pm.","David Gikawa faces life after knifing Linah Keza, the mother of his child .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A furious family are desperate to move out of their dream home - after the trees at the end of their garden got torn down to make way for a brand-new prison block for dangerous criminals. Ben Karrie, his wife Cheryl and their four-year-old daughter Isla were thrilled to move in to their £190,000 semi-detached home in Bridgend, South Wales. Although they knew the notorious Parc Prison was near to their estate, they were protected from it by a large fence and dense trees, and hoped the property would be their 'forever home'. Looming: Parc Prison, soon to be home to 1,500 dangerous prisoners, can now be seen clearly from the back of the Karries' house . Before: The prison used to be concealed from view by a dense row of trees . But not long after Mr Karrie, 35 and Mrs Karrie, 37, had bought the property in 2011, the prison was granted planning permission for a massive expansion to allow it to hold an extra 300 inmates. The building work saw the shield of trees torn up, leaving their home in full view of what will be the prison's gatehouse and visitors' centre. Once complete the category B prison - which has housed paedophile singer Ian Watkins - will be able to accommodate 1,500 category B prisoners once the extension is complete. The family is so concerned by the development that they have moved their daughter's bedroom to the front of the house. 'Forever house: Ben Karrie, 37, saved for 12 years to afford the property in Bridgend, South Wales . Before: The prison used to be invisible, but now there will be a direct line of sight to the house . Mr Karrie, a retail manager, said: 'This was meant to be our perfect house - but now we feel like the prisoners because we’ve lost our privacy. 'The trees have been ripped out and every window at the back of my house overlooks a building site. 'It will be the gatehouse and visitor centre for a prison that houses some extremely dangerous men. 'It was the privacy of the house that appealed to us. We knew the prison was some way in the distance - you could only see the lights sometimes at night through the trees. 'It has devalued our property by tens of thousands of pounds'. View: The nearby prison is visible even from the fenced-off garden . Despite paying a solicitor to check the area for them before buying, Mr and Mrs Karrie were not told about the prison plans. An application had first been submitted in 2010, but did not get formally approved until January 2013, so was not picked up. Mr Karrie said: 'I saved up for 12 years to buy this house and I wanted it to be our forever home. 'We made the neccessary checks on the land behind our house and were assured everything came back clear. Now I am left with a house that has dramatically reduced in value. 'My neighbour just sold for £169,000. A huge reduction from the same houses at the other end of the street which are selling for £200,000. It’s put my family under huge strain, financially and emotionally'. In light of the surprise development, Persmimmon Homes Wales, who sold the property to the Karrie family, has offered them the chance to move into a different home on their estate. Glyn Mabey, Chairman of Persimmon Homes Wales, confirmed the family had been given the chance to move into another new home on their estate. He said: 'We are aware of the concerns of Mr Karrie at our site and have offered the couple the chance to buy an alternate home. The prison facility has been there a long time before the homes were. 'We understand the couple are unhappy with the view now that the expansion work is ongoing. But we cannot guarantee anyone a view that is affected by building work on land we do not own'.","Ben and Cheryl Karrie bought their home in Bridgend, South Wales, in 2011 .

Officers warned they may have been attempting to make their way back to the areas they originate from as they do not have any known connections in the South Yorkshire region. Burns was serving an indeterminate . sentence, since 2007, for a knifepoint robbery and Jackson was on remand . awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter. It . came just the day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison . was arrested after going on the run for the fourth time. Back in custody: It comes the day after Arnold Pickering (left), a . convicted murderer, was found, hours after robber Thomas Moffett . (right) was also recaptured in Blackburn . Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham. The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon. The day release programme is . designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the . end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals. The . Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and . other hardened criminals were granted day release last year. Last . July, Ian McLoughlin (pictured above) was convicted of murdering Graham . Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day . release. Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010. And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal. Last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision. Thomas . Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was . also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same . prison. Moffett was arrested and is also being held in custody. Their . escape comes a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley . absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society . before being caught four days later. It came after MPs attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'. In . 1991, a judge said Pickering appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when . he decided to kill 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to . be a paedophile. He was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and . open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex. Pickering, 44, and Moffett, 51, . had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open category C prison in . Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They failed to return as . agreed at 4.30pm. Moffett, . who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 2006 . for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’. He . threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on . off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an . explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash. An urgent review is currently taking place into why Wheatley was allowed temporary day release earlier this month. Burns and Jackson failed to return to HMP Hatfield in Doncaster yesterday evening, and police believe they may be attempting to travel back to their home cities of Scarborough and Newcastle . Despite . going on the run twice beforehand, the robber was allowed to walk out . of Standford Hill open prison in Kent where he was serving 13 life . sentences. He was eventually . caught in East London on May 7 after spending almost four days on the . run and has since been charged with robbing the Chelsea Building . Society, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, at gunpoint. Last . year, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said HMP Kennet had . ‘needlessly restrictive’ security for an open prison. Located near . Liverpool, the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to . Ashworth high security hospital,  which houses Moors murderer Ian Brady. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Keeping the public safe is our priority and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders undermine public confidence in the prison system . 'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government but I take each and every incident seriously.  I have already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency. 'With immediate effect, prisoners will no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously absconded, and there will also be no unrestricted ""town leave"" . 'I am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public safety.'","Damien Burns and Dean Jackson fled .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Almost 100 criminals on life sentences are allowed out of open jails every day, the Government has admitted. The revelation came as ministers pledged to 'tear up' the day-release system amid mounting anger at the number of dangerous criminals absconding. Murderer Arnold Pickering, 44, went missing on Saturday - and was only rearrested today. Other cases: Last July, Ian McLoughlin (left), 55, was convicted of . murdering Graham Buck while on day release. Joseph Williams (right) raided 11 bookmakers during his time on temporary release in 2010 . On the run: Arnold Pickering (left), a convicted murderer was found today while robber Thomas Moffett (right) was re-arrested in Blackburn . The day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals. The Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year. Inmates who have gone on to commit crimes while on day release include double-killer Ian McLoughlin. He was on his first unescorted day out of prison when he murdered Graham Buck, 66, in July last year. Mr Buck had gone to the aid of his neighbour in Little Gaddesden, Hertforshire, when he was set upon by McLoughlin. Convicted murderer Joseph Williams, 52, carried out a string of armed robberies on bookmakers while given day release to work as a van driver. He had been jailed for life for battering a sociology lecturer to death with a hammer but was granted day release from HMP Blantyre House, in Kent, in 2010. Convicted drug-dealer Mark Neville meanwhile managed to run a £14million cocaine smuggling empire while on day release from Kirkham open jail, in Lancashire. He was allowed out to run a second-hand shop, which he used as a front to smuggle drugs into the country hidden in old furniture. His disappearance came after the infamous armed robber Michael 'Skull Cracker' Wheatley went on the run for four days earlier this month. But official figures, released by the Ministry of Justice, reveal that the two escapes were not out of the ordinary. In total, some 41,330 passes were handed to 611 criminals serving life sentences last year, giving them 'Release on Temporary Licence'. This means that on average each day last year saw 113 of Britain's most dangerous criminals allowed out of prison for the day. And many reoffend while they are back on the outside. The Government has admitted that of these lifers allowed out of prison, almost one in eight breached the terms of their release by either failing to come back, returning back late or committing another crime. Ministers this morning vowed to overhaul the system to protect the public. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would scrap the scandal of hardened prisoners walking the streets on 'town leave'. He said he was 'tearing up' the day release system which is used to reintroduuce prisoners back into society. 'I'm not happy with the way things are at the moment,' he said. 'Although the number of people absconding is tiny, we've seen in the last few months a number of serious offences committed by people on temporary licence. But we are tearing up the system as it exist at moment.' Mr Grayling said he would ban prisoners being allowed to walk around town centres. He said: 'Town-leavers will only be allowed out on temporary licence to do something tangible like a day's work. 'Serious offenders will be subject to a much stricter risk assessment. And I can't see why we allow back into open conditions people who have absconded before, so I'm looking at moving reforms in that area quickly. 'People who have absconded cannot go back to open conditions. These changes will happen within next few weeks.' Prisons minister Jeremy Wright said there would be a full assessment of the whole day release system. Mr Wright said a temporary licence could be an important tool to help offenders reintegrate into communities but 'it should not be an automatic right'. He said: 'Temporary release from prison is not a luxury - it is a way to test those serving long sentences before their eventual release. 'Public protection remains our priority which is why we have introduced crucial changes to tighten the process and scale back assess to temporary licence. 'This will ensure prisoners are tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under strict conditions before being released.' But Tory backbencher Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, described the latest disappearances as an 'absolute scandal'. He questioned why convicted murderers were ever given temporary release when figures which he obtained through parliamentary answers showed 106 had absconded in the past 10 years. Mr Davies said that when he tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill currently going through Parliament which would have prevented the temporary release of murderers, it was blocked by the Government. He said: 'It is an absolute scandal in the prison system. How on earth people like this can ever be given temporary release from prison on licence is beyond me. 'This is a regular occurence - murderers are walking out of prison willy nilly. It's a joke. I'm exasperated. I think the whole system is completely ridiculous.' Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . However, Peter McParlin, chairman of the Prison Officers Association, blamed the cuts for the escapes. He . said: ''We have been saying for many years now that we have . overcrowding in the prison estate, people are being put into open . conditions who are unsuitable for open conditions. 'Twenty prisons have closed in the last three years and prison staff numbers have reduced by 6,000 since 2010. 'There . is immense pressure on the system and it is clear to me that the tick . box mentality that goes into transferring prisoners to open conditions . has failed the public.' Adam Pemberton, Assistant Chief Executive of . Victim Support said: 'Victims and the public need, and deserve to be . protected by the criminal justice system and it’s critical that a . comprehensive risk assessment takes place before release is even . considered. 'We know from speaking to thousands of victims every year . the importance of being kept informed about developments in their case, . especially if an offender is due to be released. 'It’s important . that the reasons behind these decisions are properly explained to and . understood by victims and the public to ensure confidence is retained in . the criminal justice system.'","Around 40,000 day passes given to 600 of Britain's most dangerous criminals .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . George Osborne will tonight launch a pre-election attack on the Lib Dems, accusing his coalition partners of ‘political opportunism’ and threatening the recovery by blocking a referendum on Europe. The Tory Chancellor will use a speech to business leaders to warn Nick Clegg’s position of remaining in the European Union under any circumstances is taking a ‘risk with our economy’. Mr Osborne will also attack Labour's 'threat' to school standards and take a swipe at the Lib Dems for making ‘unaffordable and undeliverable’ promises to scrap tuition fees before the last election. George Osborne has said Ukip is a threat to the economy, but today claimed the Lib Dems' attitude to Europe was also damaging prosperity . Hours before polling stations open for local and European Parliament elections tomorrow, Mr Osborne will make a series of coded attacks on the party he has shared power with for the last four years. In a speech to the CBI dinner in London, the Chancellor will warn of several long term risks to national prosperity. He will tell pro-European business leaders that while they say there are risks to leaving the EU now, there are also dangers with agreeing to remain a member under any circumstances . ‘It is true that those who want Britain to leave the EU now, instead of working to reform it, are taking a risk with our economy.’ In a direct attack on the Lib Dem position, he will added: ‘Those who advocate membership of this union, whatever the direction it heads in and regardless of the costs it imposes on our businesses, are also taking a risk with our economy. Ed Miliband, visiting a newly-built council housing complex in Lincoln today, is a threat to teaching standards, claimed the Chancellor . ‘On its current course, the EU is pricing our continent out of the global economy.’ EU regulations are estimated to cost the UK alone up to £27 billion a year, and the Tories have a plant to reverse the ‘direction of centralising power and loading ever higher costs on the European economy’, Mr Osborne will say. ‘For that direction is destroying jobs, killing innovation, and with it, calling into question the legitimacy of the Union itself. ‘And for those who say that a referendum creates uncertainty, I say: a referendum is the only way to resolve the uncertainty that already hangs over Britain’s relationship with Europe.’ The Lib Dems have refused to match the Tory pledge to renegitaite Britain’s EU membvership before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Mr Osborne will also go on the attack over tuition fees, striking at the heart of the issue which has caused Mr Clegg more pain than any other. After promising to abolish tuition fees before the 2010 election, the Lib Dems then backed trebling them to £9,000 because both neither the Tories or Labour would agree with their policy. Mr Osborne will claim the quality of education is a risk to the economy, and argue Tory reforms to free schools, exams and a greater emphaisis on maths, science and engineering are under threat. ‘For the first time in two decades there is now a determined effort underway in Britain to reverse the decline of educational standards – and give children the quality of schooling this modern age demands. ‘All this is a massive change for the better in the education system of our country – a change whose benefits will be felt in 10, 20, 30 years time as today’s children find themselves better equipped to get good careers; and tomorrow’s businesses find themselves better able to recruit a world-class workforce. ‘But these education reforms, pursued until now by parties of the right and left, are under threat – from vested interests, from the unreconstructed teaching unions, and from the political opportunism of promising students the unaffordable and undeliverable.’ Reneging on the tuition fees pledge in autumn 2010 proved to be the most damaging decision Mr Clegg has made in coalition. His poll ratings slumped and have never recovered. The party face losing hundreds of councillors and several MEPs in tomorrow’s elections. A senior Lib Dem source dismissed the attack as an attempt to divert attentions from Tory divisions: 'The Conservatives are hopelessly split on Europe and openly flirting with exit, which would destroy British jobs. Liberal Democrats are the only party standing up for British jobs and our place in Europe. Nick Clegg, today out delivering leaflets in Stockport, has claimed leaving the EU would cost millions of jobs . 'We want to change the EU for the better, to cut waste and boost trade, but we know the best way to do that is to be there getting stuck in, not complaining from the sidelines,' the source added . Mr Osborne will also attack the anti-business alliance of Labour and the ‘populist Right’ – a reference to Ukip. He is expected to accuse the pair of wanting to ‘pull up the drawbridge and shut Britain off from the world’. The Chancellor will say: ‘They want to constrain foreign investment in our economy, and deprive us of the British jobs that it has created in industries from car manufacturing to energy,’ he will tell the Confederation of British Industry. ‘They want to set prices, regulate incomes, impose rent controls, wage war on big business, demonise wealth creation, renationalise industries – and pretend that they can re-establish control over all aspects of the economy. ‘Whether from the Left or the populist Right, we now see a deeply pessimistic, depressing, anti-business agenda.’ Mr Osborne’s remarks are designed as a trenchant attack of the economic policies of Labour’s Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who have unsettled business leaders with a series of 1970s-style policy proposals. But it is also a provocative riposte to those in his own party and Ukip who have expressed concern about foreign take-overs – most recently the stalled Pfizer bid for British-based drugs firm AstraZeneca.","Chancellor says 'long term national prosperity' threatened by today's EU .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A former journalist took her own life after suffering almost a decade of pain because doctors failed to repair her broken ankle, her husband said today. Carole Denby, 63, was walking with her husband  in Carmarthen, Wales, when she slipped and broke her left ankle in 2006. She was airlifted to hospital where she had an operation. However, it was unsuccessful - and the writer was forced to undergo a number of further operations in a bid to fix the injury. Mrs Denby's husband Howard says an eight-year medical nightmare followed - during which time his wife suffered a stroke and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Freelance journalist Carole Denby, 63, took her own life after suffering eight years of pain due to a broken ankle . Mr Denby says the night before his wife died she was in a 'black mood' after she received a letter from a health board official saying her case would be looked at after she returned from annual leave. The following day, the writer was found dead at her home in Pontyates, Carmarthenshire. She left a note which read: 'I’ve had enough. I’m sorry.' Now Mr Denby is now calling for an independent inquiry to be launched following his wife's death - and says he is 'determined to get justice' for the freelance journalist. Mr Denby said today: 'We were out walking in a . wood near Carmarthen when Carole slipped and broke her left ankle badly. Mrs Denby's left ankle was operated on several times by medics following her fall in 2006. Her husband says none of them were successful . 'She had to be airlifted to Glangwili Hospital, where she was operated . on. Unfortunately the operation was not successful, and Carole underwent . a number of further operations which saw various plates, screws and . bolts fitted.' 'She . suffered serious, recurring infections and developed septicaemia, which . I believe was caused by a reaction to the metal that had been inserted . in her ankle. 'We . were advised that she was too young for an ankle replacement. In May . 2010 Carole suffered a severe stroke, which added considerably to her . medical complications. 'By 2011 she was suffering from delusions and was . sectioned under the Mental Health Act. She had recurring mental health . problems that arose from her physical suffering.' Mr Denby says during this time he wrote to Hywel Dda University Health Board and its predecessor to try and secure better treatment for his wife. But, he said, Mrs Denby struggled to cope with the pain throughout the process. Speaking of her final day alive, Mr Denby said: 'We received an email reply to our latest complaint around teatime from [an official of the health board] advising she would look into the matter on returning from her annual leave. Carole was totally deflated by yet again being brushed aside. '[By 11.30pm she had] a really black mood, saying she was a burden and I would have been better if I had never met her. 'I told her not to be so stupid and we would get through this together...but she was very upset and said she was just so very tired and frightened she may lose her legs. 'She asked me to help her to bed and I helped her undress and get into bed, telling her to get a good night’s sleep. Mr and Mrs Denby pictured together before her accident. Mr Denby says his wife suffered numerous infections following her accident in 2006, which he believes was a reaction to metal plates put in her ankle . 'Just before midnight I took her the antibiotics and asked if she wanted a glass of milk or anything else but she said she was tired.' The following morning Mr Denby said he . took the dogs out for a walk. When he returned he went to see if Carole . was up and wanted a cup of tea, but found her dead. Mr . Denby said: 'I am now determined to get Carole the justice she did not . get when she was alive. There must be an independent inquiry into the . treatment she received.' Mr Denby says he complained to the board about various aspects of his wife’s treatment in numerous letters. The couple on their wedding day. Mr Denby says his wife's mental and physical health deteriorated severely while the couple attempted to appeal for better treatment . He also wrote to officials pressing them to authorise procedures which would help her recovery. When he complained to the NHS Ombudsman last year, he was told his wife’s case could not be investigated because the first operation on her ankle had taken place too long before. On June 19 last year, the health board’s chief executive Trevor Purt wrote to Mr Denby in response to a complaint he had made about his wife’s orthopaedic treatment. He conceded the first operation hadn’t cured the problem, but said he did not agree that metallic fragments remained in Mrs Denby’s ankle after the later operations. Mr Denby is now calling for an independent inquiry into his wife's case . He therefore took the view the health board had not been responsible for failings that could result in a civil claim against it. One of Mr Denby’s many concerns was the time it took for the health board to respond to his complaints. Last June he received an apology from Mr Purt for a delay of more than five months in replying to an email. Rhodri Glyn Thomas, the Assembly Member for for Carmarthen East & Dinefwr, said: 'Tens of letters have been written by myself and my staff to the health board about Mrs Denby’s case. My impression has been that not as much was done to help her as should have been. 'I was not happy with the board’s approach and in early February I asked for a meeting. I haven’t received a response, and sadly Mrs Denby is no longer alive. I certainly believe there should be an independent inquiry.' A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda University Health Board said: 'We have carefully reviewed the care given to Carole Denby and have been in regular contact with her husband. We offer our condolences to Mr Denby and the university health board will fully co-operate with HM Coroner.' A spokesman for the Carmarthenshire Coroner said an inquest was opened on the day of Mrs Denby’s death and will re-open after toxicology tests have been completed.

"By . Darren Boyle . A Eurofighter Typhoon adorned with commemorative D-Day invasion stripes has been unveiled ahead of the 70th anniversary of the landings. The state-of-the-art jet has been specially painted with the famous black and white markings in tribute to the role of the crews of the Hawker Typhoon during the D-Day operations. It took to the skies today at an unveiling ceremony at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire alongside a similarly adorned Spitfire, which flew in the landings. An RAF Eurofighter Typhoon following a historic Spitfire during a fly-past at RAF Coningsby . Both aircraft have been painted in special D-Day black and white stripes on their wings . The special paintwork made it easier to recognise the aircraft on D-Day and reduce the chance of them being shot down by friendly forces . Eurofighter Typhoon . Engines: 2 Eurojet EJ200 turbojets . Power: 20,000lbs of thrust each . Max Speed: 1.8 Mach . Service Ceiling: 55,000 ft . Length: 15.96m . Wing Span: 11.09m . Weapons: Missiles, 27mm cannon and 1,000lb bombs . Hawker Typhoon .

D-Day veteran John 'Paddy' Byrne was invited to today’s event. The 92-year-old, originally from Belfast but now living in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, flew the Hawker Typhoon on D-Day. After the flypast, Mr Byrne, who joined the RAF as a boy apprentice in 1938 aged 16 and served with the force until May 1946, said: 'It’s been marvellous. The flypast was fascinating to see. It’s a much faster aircraft with a jet engine where we had propellers.' Talking about D-Day, he said: 'The memory that stands out mainly in my mind is towards the end of a sweep around. I came down a country lane and I saw a horse and cart with a German soldier driving it and I thought ""well I can’t kill the horse"".' 'The Typhoon was quite a heavy aircraft but it was still a nice aircraft to fly.' The Hawker Typhoon, nicknamed Tiffy, was one of the most effective fighter bombers during the Second World War. It was originally designed as a replacement for the Hurricane but it was initially considered a failure as a fighter. However, when it was used as a ground-attack aircraft it was found to be utterly devastating. The Typhoon was the first fighter that could carry two 1,000lb bombs and was equipped with four 20mm cannons. As a result, it was very effective as a train destroyer. It was also the first British fighter to be equipped with rockets. The last remaining Typhoon from the RAF museum collection has been loaned to Canada to honour the RCAF pilots who served during the invasion of Europe. The aircraft is normally a at the centre of the D-Day exhibition at RAF Hendon. The Eurofighter will retain its striped paintwork during the summer's airshow season to commemorate the D-Day landings of June 6, 1944 . Unlike the Spitfire, pictured, the WWII era Hawker Typhoon  was a fighter bomber and was a devastating ground-attack aircraft . The RAF Typhoon could be equipped with bombs and rockets, which could not be carried by the Spitfire . The modern Typhoon, like its WWII era namesake is a multi role aircraft with devastating firepower . With a top speed of just over 400mph, the Typhoon formed part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force that extensively supported ground operations during the D-Day landings on June 6 1944. The alternating black and white invasion stripes were painted on the fuselages and wings of all RAF and Allied aircraft ahead of the landings to increase recognition by friendly forces. Today the Hawker Typhoon’s modern counterpart, the Eurofighter Typhoon, is powered by two Eurojet EJ200 turbojets and can reach Mach 1.8, flying at up to 55,000ft (16,764m). At a moment’s notice they can launch and intercept unidentified aircraft in three locations: the UK, Lithuania as part of the Nato Baltic Air Policing mission - helping to protect and secure Nato airspace over the Baltic nations of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania - and in the Falkland Islands. Flight Lieutenant Noel Rees, who flew the Typhoon today, said: 'It was an honour to be able to fly in close formation with the Spitfire and to get both aircraft with D-Day markings together. 'I’m proud to be part of the Royal Air Force and really proud to be able to fly and display this aircraft which commemorates D-Day. 'I think it’s (D-Day) one of those shocking parts of history. I’m in awe of what people on the ground were doing supported by the RAF in the air.' Flt Lt Rees said the Hawker Typhoon and its modern-day counterpart were not too dissimilar. He said: 'The Hawker Typhoon is actually not too dissimilar to the Typhoon we have now with its role, which is a multi-role aircraft. 'The Hawker Typhoon not only conducted air-to-air missions but also dive-bombing and air-to-ground missions as well. And that’s exactly what the Typhoon does these days.' The commemorative Eurofighter Typhoon will fly in air shows across the UK this summer. Allied air forces flew an astounding 14,674 during the first 24 hours of Operation Overlord, losing just 113 aircraft. Much of those losses was attributed to friendly fire as the Luftwaffe was only able to launch 319 sorties. RAF Typhoons managed 294 sorties on D-Day alone. Allied aircraft on D-Day faced a greater threat from friendly fire than they did from the German Luftwaffe as they had comprehensive air superiority . Former RAF pilot John 'Paddy' Byrne from Belfast flew the Hawker Typhoon on D-Day . Mr Byrne said that his version of the Typhoon was 'quite a heavy aircraft but it was still nice to fly' Typhoon pilot Flight Lieutenant Noel Rees, right, said the modern version of the aircraft performed a similar role to the WWII fighter-bomber, pictured beside Flight Lieutenant Anthony Parkinson of the Battle of Britain memorial flight .

'He will know if they have the United DNA of the club inside of them. If not he will let them go and let them go to other clubs. You have to play and you have to fight for Manchester United. Not only come for the money. 'What’s more important? £20k or £30k more a week or the privilege of playing for a coach like van Gaal? 'Of course it’s going to be a tricky period for him with the World Cup deciding on what transfers he will need. But if anyone can cope with a situation like this it is van Gaal. 'His credentials in Spain, in Germany, in Holland with the national team speak for themselves.'

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Wayne Rooney admits he will have no excuses if this is another dud World Cup - a tournament the England international knows he approaches at the peak of his powers. Back at Euro 2004, the 18-year-old forward set the world alight with performances that belied his tender years, earning him a place in UEFA's team of the tournament and a move to Manchester United. However, Rooney has frustrated with England at major tournaments since then and is determined to make amends this summer at what will be his third World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney discuss his fitness ahead of the 2014 World Cup . Ready: Wayne Rooney insists he is in brilliant condition ahead of the 2014 World Cup . The Liverpudlian has failed to score on the world stage so far, although he had to rush back from a metatarsal injury to feature in 2006 and carried an ankle injury into the tournament in South Africa. There are no such mitigating circumstances this time around, though, and Rooney is all too aware of the need to impress. 'I've been here before and I've said what I feel I can deliver and what I can do and it hasn't happened,' he said, speaking at England's pre-World Cup training camp in the Algarve. 'I think this is the one where I have to show what I can do. I believe I am in the best possible shape and the best condition I can be in to do that. 'I am ready for it. I am excited for it. There will be no excuses this time if I don't perform. I certainly won't be looking for any excuses this time.' Asked if he is in a better frame of mind for the exertions brought by a World Cup, Rooney added: 'Yeah, I am. I feel good. I am settled at home with my family. 'I have no issues whatsoever and I am ready for this tournament. I am going to give everything and leave everything on the pitch. 'As I've said before, I won't have any excuses this time if it doesn't come off. Keeping fit: Rooney admits there will be 'no excuses' if he fails to perform in brazil . Furthermore, Rooney is also conscious that, now aged 28, this summer represents his best opportunity to make a mark at a World Cup. 'For us, as a nation I think it is the one thing that is missing,' he said. 'And then for me personally, I feel the World Cup in 2018, I'll be a bit older then so it will obviously be difficult to impact that the way I believe I can do. 'So, I feel this is the really last big one that I feel will probably get the best out of me. I feel ready, fresh and as good as I can do to go into this tournament.' Strength: Rooney (left) holds off Gary Cahill during an England training session on Wednesday . Relaxed: Rooney chats with England captain Steven Gerrard (right) ahead of training . Rooney's determination to shine in Brazil was highlighted last week when he took two fitness coaches on his pre-tournament holiday to Portugal having missed the last three matches of Manchester United's woeful season. That dedication to the cause has been praised by manager Roy Hodgson and has seen the forward able to play a full part in each of England's training sessions in Vale do Lobo so far. 'I missed the last few games of the season and I wanted to make sure I was ready and available to train when the team met up,' Rooney added. 'That was the reason behind it. Happy families: Rooney kisses his son Kai before heading off for training on Wednesday . 'It certainly helped me get up to speed again and then obviously to join in with the team on the first day, whereas I would have had to do two or three days with the physios and the fitness coaches before I could join in.' Rooney has been impressed by what he has seen from his team-mates so far in Portugal, with the mixture of wily old-timers and youthful exuberance making him hopeful for a summer to remember. 'We can go far [at the World Cup],' he said. 'We have got the players and our aim is to win the tournament. 'We don't want to be going there saying we would be happy getting to a quarter-final or even a semi-final. Our aim is to win the tournament - that is what we are preparing for, that is what we hope is going to happen.'","Wayne Rooney believes he's in good condition ahead of England's 2014 World Cup campaign .

"By . Martin Robinson . Embarrassing: Kent Police Commissioner Ann Barnes  has been compared to David Brent after a number of toe-curling moments in an upcoming documentary . A crime tsar has admitted she has 'no idea' what her £85,000-a-year job entails in an embarrassing TV documentary. Kent Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes,  already notorious for employing a foul-mouthed teenager as her youth adviser, is under more pressure after the latest 'fiasco'. In one clip, where she has been compared to David Brent, Mrs Barnes draws an onion in an attempt to explain what types of crime Kent Police prioritises. But when asked what the rings meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't . thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.' She is then asked: 'So what would be an example of the kind of crime on . the outside of that ring?', to which she replies that he had 'no idea'. The Cutting Edge show, called Meet the Commissioner, is due to be aired on Channel 4 on May 29, is yet another embarrassment for Mrs Barnes, whose 18 months in charge at Kent Police has been dogged with controversy. In it she is asked: 'What is a police commissioner?' and . replies: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not . the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.' Scroll down for video . In trouble: Kent Police and Crime Commissioner with her 'Onion' diagram explaining police priorities, but when asked to explain what it meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea' Confused: The Cutting Edge documentary producer also asked her to name crimes towards the outer rings of the onion and again said, 'no idea' When she tries to explain on the white flipboard what a Police Crime Commissioner is she writes PPC – before realising she has the initials wrong saying 'Let's start again'. Then after struggling to explain what the job means she says: 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at . all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no . actual job description.' Later she is shown being driven around Kent in her taxpayer-funded £15,000 'battle bus' - 'Ann Force One' - which she uses to promote herself as the public face of Kent Police. Asked about criticism she received for spending public money on the minibus, . she says: 'My budget is £317m, £15,000 is money well spent - I could . have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.' She is then shown driving a convertible Mercedes . and parking it in her reserved spot at Maidstone police station. Tory Rupert Turpin, who sits on Kent Police and Crime Panel, said it was another 'media fiasco' for the PCC. 'From what I have seen it was extremely ill-advised to do a warts-and-all documentary,' he said. 'The documentary shows that she doesn't have a strong grasp of detail and brings the whole force into disrepute. 'She doesn’t know her onions and apparently doesn’t know her bananas skins either'. Spending: Mrs Barnes called her £15,000 Ann Force One battle bus good value because she could have spent the cash on a Mercedes . Contrast: In the documentary, moments after describing how a Mercedes wasn't her style, she is shown pulling up in a top of the range convertible model in her private space at work . Ann Barnes has blamed 'mischievous editing' and said today: 'When I was approached with the idea to do this documentary I gave it very careful thought. 'I finally agreed because I have vowed to be open and transparent about my job as Kent Police and Crime Commissioner. 'It’s a shame that after four months of filming, so much has ended up on the cutting room floor and the result is a mere snapshot of my working life, addressing none of the many complexities of the post of Commissioner. 'There has been an element of mischievous editing here and I would ask people to make up their own minds after watching the whole programme and not after seeing a 32 second Channel 4 publicity clip.' A senior police source told MailOnline: 'This is yet another disaster for Ann, but I'm sure she won't resign, it's not in her nature. 'She thinks she is a media darling but this has backfired badly. 'There was more than a hint of David Brent in those clips, especially when she explained her onion'. Another police source said today: 'The documentary . shows exactly why people around the UK are disillusioned with the role . of police commissioners. 'They . generally have no idea about the realities of policing and just looking . at the clips of the show made me cringe in embarrassment for her.' Transport: Mrs Barnes with her battle bus a converted camper van she uses to travel round Kent . On what her 'Crime Onion' means: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.' On her job: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not . the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner. 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at . all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no . actual job description.' On her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.' Adam Howarth, 43, of Ashford, Kent, said: 'I can't wait to watch the whole show - the poor lady obviously hasn't got a clue.' On its website, Channel 4 said the Cutting Edge show was an attempt to gauge the success of commissioners. It states: 'Do the public see her as an independent breath of fresh air, who will roll her sleeves up to get things done, or a gaffe-prone amateur who stands no chance in the face of a massive cuts to police funding?' The crime tsar came in for criticism last month when she spent almost £200,000 moving her office less than two miles. Mrs Barnes was elected as the first PCC in Kent in November 2012 despite previously branding the Government's plan to increase police accountability a 'wilful waste of money'. She became the most high-profile of the country’s 41 crime tsars a year ago when The Mail on Sunday revealed her £15,000 youth commissioner, Paris Brown, 17, had posted a series of highly offensive comments online. Miss Brown wrote the messages during the last six months before she was given the role of helping the force ‘stay in touch with young people’. Probe: Former Kent Police youth crime commissioner Miss Brown, pictured with Ann Barnes, before she was forced to give up the job . She called homosexuals ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers ‘pikeys’, and said she had ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school. In another tweet, seemingly referring to cannabis, she wrote: ‘I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.’ And she attacked the men in the reality TV programme Made In Chelsea, writing: ‘Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag.’ Mrs Barnes tried to save the teenager's job, but Brown was forced to quit. Channel 4's 'Meet the Commissioner' will be broadcast on Thursday, May 29 at 9pm. Scathing: Commissioner Bob Jones claims PCCs have been a £100m waste of money . Police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘bringing communities closer to the police, building confidence in the system and restoring trust’. They were brought in across England and Wales in November 2012 by the Conservatives to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account. But lack of enthusiasm for the reform meant the polls were held with little publicity, and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out. They are tasked with creating a police and crime plan, setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable. The former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire chief constables but this rarely happened. But one of the elected crime tsars branded them £100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with senior officers. The Labour PCC for the West  Midlands Bob Jones confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners did not make them run better nor made the public safer. PCCs have become embroiled in a series of  scandals, including: . Cumbria’s Tory PCC Richard Rhodes took two chauffeur-driven trips to meetings, costing taxpayers £700, and when the news was leaked to a local paper, the whistleblower was arrested. PCCs in Gwent and Lincolnshire forced out their chief constables. In each force only one person applied to take over the top job. A dozen or so PCCs handed out well-paid deputy roles to friends and allies without advertising them. At least four PCCs have already been investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for alleged criminal misconduct. Several PCCs have caused controversy over expenses, including Norfolk’s Stephen Bett who declared his home as his place of work, allowing him to claim mileage for driving to the force HQ. He agreed to repay £3,000.","Kent crime tsar Ann Barnes under pressure after documentary 'fiasco'

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Rory McIlroy put his personal problems behind him on Thursday as he started his bid for glory at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. The Northern Irishman only announced his split from his fiancee, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, on Wednesday but he was immediately back in action at the European Tour's flagship event. McIlroy was four under after 15 holes of an opening round interrupted by storm delays and sits six behind early leader Thomas Bjorn. Centre of attention: All eyes were on Rory McIlroy at Wentworth after he split up from Caroline Wozniacki . One to watch: Spectators surrounded the third green to get a look at McIlroy in his opening round . Local . knowledge and a fierce determination not to drift into obscurity paid . massive dividends for former Wentworth resident Bjorn. Bjorn . hailed the best round of his entire career after carding a brilliant 62 . courtesy of eight birdies and an eagle, a round completed just moments . before the first of two suspensions of play due to the threat of . lightning. 'I . was signing my scorecard when the siren went and Stephen Gallacher . looked at me and says, 'You're not having a very bad day, are you'?"" Bjorn said. 'We could kind of feel there was something going on in the . weather, so it was nice to get in.' At . 10 under par, Bjorn held a two-shot lead over Ireland's Shane Lowry, . with France's Gary Stal six under and Henrik Stenson and Players . Championship winner Martin Kaymer another two strokes back. Stenson . could need as little as a top-30 finish this week to replace Adam Scott . as world No 1, the Australian beginning the Crowne Plaza Invitational . with a one-over-par 71. Bjorn . missed the cut in last week's Spanish Open and feared the worst in a . tournament that has produced just one top-10 finish (in 1998) in 16 . previous appearances. Out in front: Thomas Bjorn leads the tournament after shooting a stunning 62 in his first round . 'You . shoot great rounds in your career but to shoot 62 on this course, you . can't ask for more,' said Bjorn, who went on to win the European Masters . in 2011 the last time he shot 62 on the European Tour. 'I . don't really know where to start. Last week was awful and I was . starting to feel a little frustrated with things. Practice this week, I . was not good either. 'To . step out on this course of all courses and play like I did today was . surprising. Although I lived here for nine years it's not a place where I . think it's going to be a great week, but I have to stick my head down . now and focus on the rest of the week.' Pin-point accuracy: This approach to the 18th set up a birdie for Bjorn - the eighth of a stunning opening round . Thomas reigns in the rain: The umbrellas were up as Bjorn holed out to complete his first round . Bjorn, . who looks set to qualify for his first Ryder Cup appearance since 2002, . birdied the second, fourth and seventh to reach the turn in 32 before a . superb scoring burst on the back nine. The . 43-year-old birdied the 10th and 11th and holed from just six feet for . an eagle on the par-five 12th, before picking up further birdies on the . 14th, 16th and 18th. Wet and wild: The rain hammered down at Wentworth as play was suspended twice . Asked . to explain his renaissance after falling out of love with the game five . or six years ago, Bjorn added: 'Hard work. Determination to not let a . golf career fade away. 'I've . just been determined to get myself to where I can play with the best in . the world and I'll keep continuing to do that as long as my body allows . me to. 'I enjoy being out here, which I probably didn't do for a couple of years. 'It's . very easy when you get past 40 to stop enjoying this after a long . career. I have travelled with my golf clubs since I was 14 years old and . sometimes you forget why you love the game and it becomes hard work.' Ruled out: Sergio Garcia has been forced to withdraw from the tournament with a knee injury after an opening round of 73 . Bjorn . is currently third in the Ryder Cup qualifying race but added: 'I still . think I need to do a lot more. There's a lot of guys playing great golf . at the moment and over the last few weeks a few names are all starting . to come back into the frame. 'I've . watched a lot from the sidelines (he has been vice-captain three times) and that can hurt a little bit, but I wanted to play in another Ryder . Cup and I've got to stay focused and determined to keep playing good . golf to get there.' Lowry's . round was twice disrupted by the bad weather, but the 27-year-old - who . won the Irish Open as an amateur in 2009 - was not about to say a bad . word about the tournament. 'I love it around here,' said Lowry, who was fourth in 2011 and 12th last year. 'It's a great event. It's a great golf course. 'I've been struggling and my best finish this season was last week, tied 15th in the Spanish Open. 'I've . missed a few cuts and haven't really been putting that well but I . managed to find something at home a couple of weeks ago and hopefully . can keep it going. 'I went back to an old putter that I used years ago and it brought back good memories maybe.' A knee injury meant that Sergio .

Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois admits his Chelsea future next season is 'unclear' ahead of Saturday's Champions League final for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in Lisbon.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . It's perhaps no surprise that Yaya Toure wants to have his cake and eat it when the man pulling the strings is his long-time representative and mentor Dimitry Seluk. Those who have become used to Seluk’s bizarre utterances over the years will not have been shocked by the latest outburst in which he accused Manchester City of snubbing his famous client’s 31st birthday. The Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala once bought Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos a £800,000 Bugatti car, he noted. All Yaya got was two birthday cakes. Influential: Agent Dimitry Seluk is the man driving Yaya Toure's latest outburst at Manchester City . Top of the pops: Toure stands proudly with manager Manuel Pellegrini after sealing the Premier League title . Return? Seluk engineered Toure's move from Barcelona but the midfielder is keen on a return to the Nou Camp . Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano, City’s director of football and chief executive, have certainly seen it all before during their time at Barcelona when Seluk was forever sniping over the club’s reluctance to give Toure a better deal or more playing time. Then coach Pep Guardiola became so exasperated by Seluk’s verbal incontinence that he confronted the player and demanded to know how he could respect Toure when his agent spoke without restraint so frequently. The issue is understood to have convinced Barca to sell Toure 12 months before he joined City for £24million. Even then, Seluk hardly helped the deal to go through. ‘City talk a lot, but when they put their offer in writing, they don’t look like a rich club, but a bankrupt one,’ he said. After Toure helped his new club win the Premier League title in 2012, Seluk claimed that he might have to leave because he needed ‘new motivations’. Last year he got the Ivory Coast star a lucrative new deal after they claimed there were too few shirts bearing his name on sale in the club shop. Now this. So who is the eccentric Ukrainian agent who has forged such a strong bond with Toure over the years that the player named his second child after him? A picture of Seluk on his Facebook page . shows the agent relaxing in Monaco, where he is now  based, in front of a . billboard for Chopard, an exclusive brand of Swiss wristwatches and . jewellery. It is a fitting image. Close: Toure named his second child after his agent Seluk after the pair became good friends . Sliding in: Despite the outburst, Toure is paid handsomely by City, north of £200,000-a-week . Fast car: Seluk noted that Roberto Carlos was bought a Bugatti by Russian club Anzhi on his birthday . ‘I like my players more than I like money,’ Seluk said recently, but he has certainly become a rich man off Toure’s success and stands to make even more if he can engineer one more big transfer before Toure retires. They first got together when Toure left Ivory Coast to join Belgian club KSK Beveren in 2001. Such was Seluk’s hold over the player that Yaya ignored advice from his own brother Kolo to join Ukrainian team Metalurh Donetsk. From there it was on to Olympiacos, Monaco and then Barcelona. ‘Yaya trusts me 100 per cent,’ said Seluk. ‘When he was young, I put him in more difficult situations so he had to grow and have a stronger personality. That paid off for him.’ And for Seluk as well. ‘This guy says one thing one day and another thing on the other,’ Toure once remarked. City just wish he would say nothing at all.","Seluk has been Toure's representative since 2001 .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Over a few beers one night Brendan Foster managed to squeeze out of David Coleman a few of his secrets about what makes a great commentary. ‘When it’s a big race,’ he replied, ‘don’t say something that people might just remember, say something that they will never forget.’ Not an easy trick, of course, but through his distinguished career Coleman managed to pull it off ridiculously often, either with vocabulary or purely by intonation. He was there: David Coleman with West Ham's Bobby Moore after the 1964 FA Cup final win over Preston . Memorable: Coleman's commentary of Gordon Banks' save against Pele at the 1970 World Cup is iconic . It was this ability that helped draw many of the great and the good from his world to the BBC’s Broadcasting House on Wednesday for a celebration of the life and work of a man described several times as ‘the nation’s greatest ever sports broadcaster’. Sports fans of a certain age will recall that the voice of Coleman, who died at 87 late last year, brought a stamp of authenticity to so many great events. And even if it was not a significant occasion, he could transport you to a world where it was. As Sue Barker, who also took to the Radio Theatre stage to pay tribute, said: ‘He made sport sound so special, including the mundane.’ Coleman was a colossus behind the microphone in an era when sports coverage was less atomised than it is now, with the relative lack of players in the market making huge stars out of their figurehead broadcasters. That less can be more was a recurring theme, as one of his articles of faith was never to talk too much. ‘When you see a picture, caption it,’ he told Foster. ‘And don’t forget that silence can be the most powerful thing.’ Wembley moment: Manchester United captain Noel Cantwell hangs onto the FA Cup as he is interviewed by Coleman in the 1963 final win over Leicester City . Ups and downs: Coleman speaks with Wolves' winning captain Bill Slater, as a dejected Blackburn captain Ronnie Clayton listens in after their 3-0 FA Cup final loss in 1960 . Bursts of footage reminded us that nobody could impart such meaning to a few simple words of the language, such as ‘One-nil’. His exclamation that accompanied Gordon Banks denying Pele in the 1970 World Cup — ‘What a save!’ — is a moment of spine-tingling drama comparable with Cliff Morgan’s ‘What a score!’ to describe Gareth Edwards’s great Barbarians try three years later. Coleman’s first television shift in London was the night Roger Bannister broke four minutes for the mile in 1954 and his last major event was his 11th Olympics at Sydney in 2000. Proud of his local newspaper roots, he brought a hard, journalistic edge to his work. He was unlike many of the pristine, photogenic young sports presenters of today, who you might prefer to marry your daughter than tell you the score. While Coleman could be almost childishly hostile to some rivals from other organisations, they respected his talent, and he inspired fondness, admiration and loyalty among BBC colleagues such as John Motson. ‘Every time he picked up the microphone he came alive, he elevated his performance,’ said Motson. ‘He encouraged us to aim for the standards he set. There was David and then there was the rest of us. Instantly recognisable: Coleman covered 11 summer Olympics for the BBC, including the 1980 Moscow Games . The voice of sport: David Coleman was recruited by the BBC in 1955 and presented Grandstand . ‘Somebody . once told me, ‘‘His bark is worse than his bite’’. Don’t you believe . it! The new generation of broadcasters could learn a lot by looking back . at Coleman gems.’ Athletics was particularly well represented on Wednesday, with Daley Thompson, Linford Christie, David Hemery and Roger Black among those in attendance. Steve Cram said that words of praise from Coleman could mean more than those from a coach, and Foster recalled the inspiration of his commentary from the Rome Olympics of 1960: ‘I wanted to do something that David Coleman would speak about.’ The man who brilliantly anchored coverage of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre was versatile too. He could ‘do light’, repeatedly illustrated in a long and successful run as presenter of A Question of Sport for nearly 20 years. The edition in 1987 that featured Princess Anne, seen as a massive coup, drew a gargantuan 18 million viewers. Coleman also pulled off another trick that cannot have been easy — enjoying an extremely happy family life with his wife Barbara, despite the pressures of a hugely demanding career and considerable fame. The touching tributes from two of his six children, all of whom were present along with grandchildren, bore testament to that. Quite remarkable: Coleman presented A Question of Sport for 18 years. Here he is pictured with John Rutherford, Emlyn Hughes, Nigel Mansell, Bill Beaumont, Princess Anne and Linford Christie .

The Italians have targeted Arteta as they plan major changes this summer with two on-loan players Anderson (Man Utd) and Modibo Diakite (Sunderland) due to the return to their Premier League clubs and a third loanee Alessandro Matri heading back to AC Milan. Arteta was in the Arsenal side that captured the FA Cup last weekend, their first trophy for nine years but has only 12 months left on his contract and has hit out at the club’s policy of only offering one-year extensions to players aged over 30.

For me, a much bigger asset is someone who has played 125 games in three years compared to someone who played 25, if he is 20-years-old. 'That’s my opinion. ‘I understand the club point of view: “Mikel is not a £25m player because he is not 22 any more”. But I know what else I can give. So it’s to find the right balance between mentalities. We need to analyse and talk about it.' Fiorentina, known in Italy as La Viola, qualified for next season’s Europa League by finishing fourth in Serie A and they see Arteta as an ideal foil for strikers Giuseppe Rossi and Mario Gomez.

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . Gareth Bale is talking about positioning. More specifically, about getting into better positions more often to score more goals. It is a part of his game he would like to improve and what, you might ask, is so unusual about that when this is a player already reflecting on so many goals for Real Madrid? Well it’s the fact that this is the same player managers once regarded as a left back. A player, it is worth reminding ourselves, who once had to battle with Benoit Assou-Ekotto for a place in the  Tottenham team. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Gareth Bale speak ahead of the Champions League final . Dream start: Gareth Bale is hoping to win the Champions League during his first season at Real Madrid . Defining moment: Bale celebrates scoring Real's winning goal in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona . Finding his feet: Bale has shone since his £85million move from Tottenham last summer . Harry Redknapp saw the value in pushing him further forward,  eventually deploying him on the left wing and unleashing a talent that took the Champions League by storm. The 24-year-old is now ready to play in a European Cup final on Saturday, when Carlo Ancelotti’s side face Atletico Madrid in Lisbon. Since arriving in Spain he has been christened ‘The Cannon’, and it is a nickname that captures the sometimes spectacular nature of his goals. But to this observer none has been more spectacular than his 20th of the season; the goal that secured the Copa del Rey against Barcelona. We knew Bale was quick. But it is hard to recall a more impressive demonstration of pure pace on any pitch than the burst he mustered to take him past Marc Bartra after the Barca defender had knocked him into touch. That goal is seen as the defining moment of Bale’s first season abroad. ‘I scored a similar goal for Wales maybe six weeks beforehand,’ said Bale, who was speaking at an EA Sports 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil event. ‘I was just focused on the ball but if I am in a sprint with someone I fancy myself. It was great to score the goal. It was important to win the first trophy of the season. It gave us a lot of confidence.’ It is a quiet confidence that appears to be at the root of Bale’s success. A confidence that has  enabled him to take the move to Madrid in his stride. On the run: Bale skips away from Bayern winger Franck Ribery at the Allianz Arena . Star man: Wales winger Bale features in EA Sports' official 2014 Brazil World Cup game . Silverware: Bale celebrates the first trophy of his career with former Spurs team-mate Luka Modric . When he arrived, much was made of how he might operate alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. Whether the  finest player in English football could exist in harmony with the  finest player in the world. But Bale credits Ronaldo with being a reason why his has been such a smooth transition. ‘Cristiano has been very supportive,’ said Bale. ‘From the first day I came in, he has been there for me. On day one he gave me advice on the best areas to live and stuff like that. ‘We talk a lot; have a good  relationship on and off the pitch. I’ve learned a bit of everything from him. The way he plays and gets himself into certain positions; it’s a chance to learn off one of the best players in the world. Hopefully, that will improve me as a player.’ It is at this juncture that he mentions that area where he feels he needs to improve — scoring goals. ‘I don’t think there’s anything specific,’ he said. ‘It is more my all-round game, positioning-wise. I need to get myself into more goal-scoring positions. Influential: Bale admits he is learning 'a bit of everything' from Cristiano Ronaldo . Getting along: Bale says his relationship with Ronaldo is flourishing on and off the pitch . Fans' favourite: Bale has endeared himself to Madrid's fans with 15 La Liga goals in his first season . ‘Every year I try to keep improving and I tell myself that if I keep working hard I will get better.’ To be part of the team that wins La Decima — Madrid’s 10th European Cup — would be special. ‘It would be a dream to win it,’ said Bale. Nothing makes a footballer feel more settled than success on the field. As Bale said: ‘The time was right to go to Madrid. I am really glad I did it. I am trying to embrace everything, trying to enjoy the ride. It was also important to not only have some friends over but some family as well. I have got a great team around me. ‘I always had confidence in my ability and the fact we are now chasing the 10th title, against our city rivals, is very exciting. ‘Madrid has a real buzz about it.

Jamie Redknapp told me his knee man, Richard Steadman, was the best in the business but our first meeting wasn’t quite what I was expecting. ‘Steady’ makes his judgments based on what he sees inside the knee during surgery and also on what he feels by touching the knee. Agony: Bullard is helped off after suffering another injury in 2009 with Hull . I thought I was there for surgery so when, during our first meeting, he turned off the light in the room and began feeling my knee, I thought ‘Is this guy a bit of a weirdo?’ Luckily, he was not. In fact, he was as good as he was cracked up to be. Soon after surgery, my physio Luke and I unwrapped the heavy bandaging on my knee. It was a horror show. My knee was five times its normal size, there was an enormous scar stretched right across it and it was bright red. I was close to tears and said to Luke: ‘There’s no way I’m coming back from this.’ And then, just at the point where I was feeling like throwing in the towel, a man hopped into the room walking on what looked like two paper-thin, artificial legs.

On the pitch, there were no problems as I gave my all for him, as I would have done for any manager. We just never had that special relationship.

It was the start of the 2008-09 season and my form for Fulham going  back to the start of the year had been recognised by England. It was definitely the pinnacle of my career, which is why I would never have believed anyone who would have told me I’d be a Hull player by January. But this is football and anything can happen, on and off the pitch. Things like the future manager of England playing golf instead of turning up to a meeting with me to discuss the possible extension of my contract. Having suffered a horrible knee injury,  I was worried that the 16 months left on my Fulham deal would not cover me sufficiently if it should happen again. So I asked the club if they would consider giving me a new, longer deal to make me feel more secure. I was playing well so I really didn’t envisage any stumbling blocks. A meeting was set up between me, my agent Andy Evans, Hodgson and the Fulham chief executive Alistair Mackintosh. Andy and I met up with the chief exec, but there was no sign of Roy. Alistair was a bit confused by that and called him, only to find out he was playing golf and wouldn’t be coming. That was the end of that meeting. I thought it was bang out of order. It doesn’t matter if you’re the chairman, owner or manager, you have to treat people with respect and that’s pretty much what I told Roy the next time I saw him. I asked him where he’d been when we were supposed to have had a meeting and  I told him it showed me and my agent a  lack of respect. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been so hostile, but his decision not to attend that meeting spoke volumes. The bloke was immaculate. His kit was tight and fitted him perfectly. Paolo di Canio became West Ham club captain and his skipper’s armband had claret and blue tassles hanging off it, making him look like a warrior.

"By . Becky Dickinson . The sound of my newborn son’s cries filtered through the floorboards, stinging my ears and piercing my heart. But I daren’t go to him. He was in the possessive grasp of my mother-in-law, who’d placed an exclusion zone of fierce grandmotherly love around him, barring all from going near. ‘Nonna’ was here, and she gripped Jonas to her chest and peered at me, her coal-black eyes filled with a direct challenge. It was a high-noon stand-off. ‘Mine’ she seemed to say, as she cooed at him. So began one of the most painful weeks of my life, one which still smarts now when I think about it, and which pushed my relationship with my husband, Uli, to the brink. Devoted: Becky's son Jonas with his grandma Maria . To this day, I still feel hurt and resentful when I recall how my first weeks of motherhood were tainted by the interference of my Italian mother-in-law, Maria. She made me feel superfluous, useless and inferior — that I was nothing more than a uterus that had delivered her first-born grandson. And a second-rate uterus, at that. Maybe it was partly down to the clash of cultures. Nonna is from Bologna, and speaks barely a word of English, and I speak no Italian. Maybe it was also because she’d been widowed at 26: Uli, her youngest, was just 18 months old when his father was killed in a car crash, leaving her to raise her three children single-handedly. It had left her fiercely proud of her family, as well as being very critical of their partners. From the ruinous state of my post-baby body to the way I held my son, I fell short in every department. And Uli, the devoted mamma’s boy, seemed to accept her word on everything, excluding me as they gabbled in their own language. Whenever I hear friends complain about how little help they get from their in-laws, I want to shout how lucky they are. Feeling pushed to the side: Becky Dickinson (left) with her partner Uli and his mother 'Nonna' with one of their daughters . I’d been a mother for just eight days when she came sweeping through the door of our home in Addlestone, Surrey, and literally wrenched Jonas from my arms. Taken aback at her forthrightness, I tried to put it down to excitement. He was, after all, her first grandchild. Yet as she clutched Jonas to her chest, ignoring me, my heart pounded in panic. Although logically, I knew he was safe, a new mother’s protective hormones turn her into a lioness. I would have fought and killed for Jonas. The trouble was, so would Nonna. But instead of standing up to my mother-in-law, I went upstairs and wept. Looking back, I can’t believe I was so weak, so unassertive. I can only put it down to the shock I felt at having a domineering stranger barge into my life. First grandchild: The way Nonna (pictured) acted with baby Jonas made mother Becky feel panicked . This was her first visit to our home. Although I’d met her a few times in Italy, we’d never got beyond small-talk due to the language barrier. Although she’d never said it, I wondered if she blamed me for luring her son to another country. Uli and I had met on a skiing trip in 2004. He was my instructor and we quickly recognised that our laughter on the slopes was the start of something more meaningful. He moved to Britain a year later, and set up his own house refurbishment business. But it wasn’t until I gave birth that I realised the true character of my mother-in-law. From the outset of her visit, she made it clear that ‘Nonna knows best’. And Uli did nothing to correct her. She was constantly hurling ‘advice’ on everything from feeding to sleeping. Everything she did contradicted modern parenting advice: she put Jonas on his tummy to sleep and swaddled him in layers and layers of blankets. I even had to stop her feeding him camomile tea. Since when did a newborn baby need tea? ‘It’s just how they did things in her day,’ Uli said, as Maria stropped off. Of course, my husband ran after her to console her, rather than me. More than 60 per cent of women say their relationship with their mother-in-law makes them stressed . Breastfeeding became my only solace, the only time Jonas was all mine. Even then, she’d stand so close that I felt inhibited and self-conscious. Once, she unexpectedly yanked up my top, revealing my postnatal belly. ‘Che pancia!’ she remarked (what a stomach!). It was utterly humiliating. Upstairs, Uli and I hissed at each other. I was sick of being undermined and humiliated. In my worst moments, I wanted to run away with my baby. Her week-long visit eventually ended, but the effect on Uli’s and my relationship reverberated for long after. Despite the tension, she would arrive at our door every three months without fail and stay for a week. ‘You can’t stop me seeing my mother!’ Uli would fume. ‘She can’t stop me from being a mother!’ I would retort. I loved him, but there were times when I wondered if I’d be better off alone. When I went on to give birth to two daughters — Daisy in 2010 and Anya in 2013 — I felt stronger and more in control. Yet still Nonna flew in to undermine me. I had to justify everything I did, from not putting salt in my children’s food, to not letting them ‘sweat out’ a fever to (gasp) letting them run around barefoot — a scandalous offence, as she believed colds are caused by floors, not viruses. Happy family: Nonna with her grandchildren Daisy, Anya and Jonas . During one of Nonna’s visits, I left her to give Daisy and Anya breakfast, while I took Jonas to school. I got back to find both children triumphantly sucking Oreo biscuits, having clearly ignored the cereal, toast and eggs on offer. She knew my views on this. Biscuits were a treat, not breakfast. ‘No biscotti!’ I said, at which she and the children just smirked conspiratorially. It was only when my youngest, Anya, turned 18 months — the age Uli had been when his father died — that relations between us started to thaw. One day, exhausted and stressed, trying to juggle work, money and the family, I tried to imagine being responsible for these three little ones all on my own. How did Maria manage it, producing such a loving, loyal and well-adjusted son as Uli? Not so bad after all: Nonna with her grandson Jonas . Suddenly, the thought of Maria’s next visit didn’t feel quite so much as an invasion, but a welcome extra pair of loving hands. The children clearly adore their Nonna, and love chatting in her native language. And I’ve been making an effort to improve my Italian too, so I don’t feel so excluded.I’ve also stocked the biscuit barrel, am practising my vocabulary and am determined to grit my teeth. Maybe we can start again. Strong family ties: Nonna and baby Anya . I have no recollection of my father. He died far too soon and my mother sacrificed everything to give me, my brother and sister a good upbringing. It’s no surprise, then, that I will always love and admire her. After Jonas was born, I couldn’t wait to share the experience with my mother. So  I couldn’t understand why Becky felt so threatened. That first visit was a nightmare. Nonna just wanted to get to know her grandson, but Becky couldn’t bear to share him. Somehow she thought she was trying to steal him. She couldn’t see how ridiculous that was or disrespectful to my mother’s feelings. After all, she was only visiting us for a week. I couldn’t help but feel that all this highlighted the massive cultural gaps between England and Italy. Back home, families are much stronger, there’s none of this ‘not interfering’ business. I felt like a hostage, stuck in a field between two raging bulls. It didn’t help that Mother and Becky didn’t speak the same language. Not only was I torn between two different cultures, I was constantly having to translate for them, too. I love Becky — and my mother. I just hope, over time, they will learn to love each other.","Mother-in-law Maria made mother Becky feel superfluous and inferior .

"By . David Clough . Eoin Morgan believes Alex Hales has all the required skills to be able to successfully adapt his powerful Twenty20 batting for the one-day international format. Hales' 66 from 41 balls kept England in contention for much of the NatWest Twenty20 against world champions Sri Lanka at The Oval, before the hosts fell nine runs short of their opponents' 183 for seven on Tuesday night. Morgan acknowledged the part played by the tourists' captain Lasith Malinga, whose figures of three for 28 - including the wicket of Hales - prevented England getting any closer. Vital: Lasith Malinga and his Sri Lanka team-mates celebrate taking the wicket of England's Alex Hales . Big hitter: Alex Hales was in fine form against Sri Lanka at The Kia Oval . The stand-in Twenty20 captain also mentioned in despatches the efforts of short-format debutant seamer Harry Gurney. But setting aside his disappointment that England had come up short and been unable to repeat their defeat of Sri Lanka at the ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh - where Hales made an unbeaten century - Morgan singled out the opener again. 'Again Hales' continued form in international cricket has been brilliant,' he said. Asked if the Nottinghamshire big-hitter could be just as effective in 50-over cricket, Morgan added: 'I can't see why not.' Hales has yet to be picked in the intermediate format, and England are about to take on Sri Lanka without him in five ODIs - starting back at The Oval on Thursday. 'It's the new way of getting your way in, how modern cricketers start - in Twenty20 and move in from there,' said Morgan. 'There's certainly no reason why not if he applies himself in the right way.' Disappointing: But England were defeated by Sri Lanka in the opening Twenty20 international . Dominant: Lasith Malinga celebrates taking the wicked of Ian Bell in the second innings . Gurney also did Notts proud, unflattered by figures of two for 26. 'Harry Gurney had a great debut,' said his captain. 'He showed great clarity of thought and a great level of skill - especially against Thisara Perera, who is capable of smashing the ball to all parts at the end. 'He has shown great skill at the death today, and done that at Notts for quite some time.' Gurney's left-arm angle provides a new variety to England's attack, Morgan points out. 'He's got something different,"" he said. It used to be Jade Dernbach who had something different in our team, and that worked for a while. Now it's Harry Gurney. 'The more he plays, the more he learns - and I think the more he'll improve.' Fierce: Nottinghamshire seamer Harry Gurney wasn't flattered by impressive figures on Tuesday night .

Clarke was fined 20 per cent of his match fee by the ICC for the remark in Brisbane, which was was picked up by the on-ground stump microphone and inadvertently relayed to the watching world. The Australian acknowledged the confrontation, which was allegedly sparked when Anderson threatened to punch the hosts' Test debutant George Bailey in the face, may not have shown him in a good light but did not regret standing up for his team-mate.

'Maybe I hadn't said exactly what I said to James Anderson (previously), but I'd stuck up for my players on a number of occasions and it's never been picked up on the stump mic,' Clarke told www.cricket.com.au. Squaring up: Anderson and Clarke have words during the winter's first Ashes Test . 'I regret the language I used and I regret that I said it over the stump mic. 'The last thing I want is for boys and girls watching cricket to be going and playing club cricket and saying things like that to opposition players. 'I think it's unacceptable that the Australian cricket captain is setting that example. 'But I don't regret standing up for George Bailey one bit. I don't regret being extremely honest with James Anderson and telling him what Mitchell Johnson's plan was. 'I don't regret that - I just regret that everybody heard it and the language I used.' Clarke dismissed talk that the spat . was driven by a long-standing grudge between the pair, who first played . against each other 12 years ago. 'The media like to do up that we have history,' the 33-year-old said. 'The only history I have is that England kept beating us. 'And he (Anderson) was a part of England and I was part of Australia.' Clarke . also said he hoped suggestions that people liked him more because of . the row were wrong, adding: 'I think it's an insult if that's why it . (public opinion) has changed.

"By . Tom Sheen . Follow @@Tom_Sheen . The Oklahoma City Thunder will have a huge task in front of them tonight as they attempt to level the series with the San Antonio Spurs. NBA analysts Reggie Miller and Greg Anthony agree that now third best player Serge Ibaka is missing the series with an injury, Scott Brooks' squad are over-reliant on star duo Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. The Spurs dominated in game one on their way to a blowout 122-105 victory. Over-reliant: The Oklahoma City Thunder are too reliant on star duo Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook and must find a way to have a reliable third scoring option after the injury to Serge Ibaka . Missing: Thunder forward Serge Ibaka will miss the series with the San Antonio Spurs because of injury . 'You just can't rely on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook because Coach Pop (Gregg Popovich) will live with those guys getting 70 points and seeing where that other 30 is going to come from,' said Miller an Hall of Famer who is now an analyst for TNT. Serge Ibaka is suffering with an injured calf and is not expected to play in this series. He is the Thunder's best inside defender and also their third option on offence. The Spaniard was averaging 12 points, seven rebounds and two blocks before injuring himself. Nick Collison started in his place in the game one defeat, but had no points in just 15 minutes of play. Miller added: 'You would assume it would be Reggie Jackson (to pick up the scoring slack). He's had his way with the Spurs in the regular season, he averaged 21 points and shot almost 60 per cent in their four games. Third option: Reggie Jackson could be the one to take up some of the scoring slack . 'If you're going to start Kendrick Perkins, Nick Collison and Thabo Sefolosha those guys can't have five points combined, because then you're playing two against five. 'If you're the Spurs you can load against Westbrook and Durant. But if those guys score 5-7 pts each then it's a little bit different because you've got to play everyone honest.' Miller, a five-time all-star with the Indiana Pacers, added: 'I see Perry Jones being a player with potential in this series. I could see him being the type of player getting you seven-10 points. But it's got to be by committee whoever that third scorer is going to be.' Evergreen power forward Tim Duncan, 38, scored a game-high 27 points in the opener, with Ibaka's absence allowing Duncan to get a number of good, open looks. The best ever: Tim Duncan, 38, scored a game-high 27 points in game one of the Western Conference finals . Greg Anthony, who played on six teams in a 10-year career, said: 'You have to start by acknowledging that he's the greatest power forward to ever play the game. The most dominant two-way player we've had at that position without a doubt. 'I have no idea how he's been able to continue at that level (despite his age). Pop has been phenomenal to help balance that but it comes down to him being a consummate professional.' Miller added: 'What I love about Tim is that it's always been about fundamentals throughout his career. 'He wasn't like Charles (Barkley) or (Karl) Malone who had great athleticism or brute strength, he played a thinking man's game. 'It shows if you have great footwork, if you can think the game, you can play at a very high level for a very long time. There's not been a huge drop off because he never had to rely on athleticism, it was more of a chess game for him, whereas a lot of guys have been playing checkers throughout their careers.' Disruption: If the Thunder are to stand a chance tonight they have to find a way to disrupt the Spurs . Anthony does believe that the Thunder have a chance to steal tonight's game, however. 'The Spurs are the most difficult team to guard in the NBA because the ball finds the right guy,' Anthony, also an NBA analyst, said. 'You don't know where the shot is going to come from when you face San Antonio becasue their ball movement is so flawless and their spacing is terrific. 'That's the challenge for OKC, defensively they have to disrupt timing and spacing. Can you throw them off, get deflections, contain them, get them out of rhythm. If you can do that you can have success.' Game two tips off tonight at 2am. Watch live NBA action on BT Sport including comprehensive coverage of the Playoffs and Finals.

"By . Jimmy Bullard . I looked at the team sheet for the Chelsea game because I always checked it, not for one minute because I expected not to see my name. When I didn’t see it, my first thought was that there must have been some mistake. But then I read down and saw that I was named there after all. As a substitute. An instant rage built up inside me. What the f*** was going on? Here I was playing in the Premier League with Wigan, on a run of 123 consecutive games, stretching back to when I’d first joined them in the third tier. Fight: Bullard (left) described his violent spat with then Wigan boss Paul Jewell (right) BEND IT LIKE BULLARD by Jimmy Bullard is published by Headline Publishing Group at £16.99. For some ridiculous reason, our manager Paul Jewell clearly thought it was time for a change but I wasn’t having it. This was bang out of order. So I went steaming down to the gaffer’s office and knocked on his door. ‘What’s the f***ing script with me being dropped, then?’ I said as I sat down opposite him. ‘Chelsea away? There’s something wrong with you, ain’t there?’ ‘What do you mean?’ he said, looking unimpressed with my attitude. ‘I’ve picked the team I think will do best.’ That was like a red rag to me. ‘You cannot tell me I don’t deserve to be playing,’ I told him. But Paul was adamant: ‘No, I think you need a rest.’ But I wasn’t listening. I was livid. ‘Look, you mean I’ve fought through a boyhood career tooth and nail, only to miss a game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge? I don’t think so. After more than 100 games in a row, drop me for Middlesbrough or something, not against Chelsea, the title holders.’ Suddenly, I was back on the parks pitches as a kid after a defeat, or the West Lodge working men’s club after  losing at pool. There were no tears this time, just pure anger. I stood up and yelled, ‘F***ing poxy decision that is!’ and shoved my chair away, hurling it across the floor. I grabbed the door, but I was only halfway out of the room when Paul launched himself across his desk, shouting: ‘Who do you think you’re f***ing talking to?’ Good times: Bullard was at Wigan between 2003 and 2006, seeing them promoted twice . And as he said that he pushed on the door that I was pulling open, cracked my nose and shut my head in it. For a split second I was in the maddest position. The manager was holding a door shut with my head stuck in it as I looked at Bill Green, the chief scout, who was sat at his desk, opposite the gaffer’s office. I managed to grab Paul and he grabbed me at the same time, shoving me up against the wall in his office, yelling: ‘Have a bit of respect.’ ‘You’ve broken me f***ing nose,’ I screamed back. ‘Have you f***ing calmed down?’ ‘Yes, I’ve f***ing calmed down, now get your hands off me!’ He released his grip and I stormed out screaming, ‘He’s broken me nose’ until I got into my car. We’d played Arsenal in their last-ever game at Highbury and we were all in the changing room after a 4-2 defeat. Pascal Chimbonda was still in his Wigan kit as he handed Paul Jewell a card. The boss thanked him and walked out. Our goalkeeper Mike Pollitt looked at me and whispered: ‘The gaffer thinks it’s a thank-you card, but I think it’s a transfer request.’ Seconds later, Jewell stormed back in and I was thinking Pascal’s head might soon become acquainted with that dressing room door. He marched straight over to Pascal: ‘You f***ing p****! After everything I’ve done for you, you hand in a transfer now.’ He had to be pulled away from Pascal who didn’t seem to understand what the fuss was about. We all knew that you have to see the manager privately to hand in a transfer request, but Pascal had decided to do things differently. Maybe he’d been badly advised. Really badly advised. Magic moment: Bullard celebrates avoiding relegation with Fulham team-mate Danny Murphy in 2008 . I hadn’t lost it like that since I was a kid and part of me immediately regretted it. Another part of me was mentally going through the boxing moves I’d learned years before. I took my place on the bench at the Bridge the next day, but not before Bill Green asked me what had happened. I blamed it all on Paul,  naturally. ‘He took a right liberty, squashing my head in the door’, I remember saying to him. The gaffer was certainly over the scrap as he brought me on for the last 20 minutes at Chelsea, but we still lost. After the game, we spoke about our scrap — Paul reminded me that I was lucky to get out of his office alive —and agreed to move on. Months later, I even realised that his decision was right.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A new luxury skincare line which is infused with cannabis flower extracts has emerged, promising to treat a host of skin conditions. Apothecanna, based in weed-friendly Denver, Colarado, is the first company in the U.S. to legally sell cannabis derived skincare products and has launched three debut lotions to the mass public; pain creme, stimulating creme and calming cream - all priced $12 for a tester and $36 for a standard bottle. According to the brand, the topically applied products won't get you 'inebriated' or show up on a standard drugs test, but they will soothe a variety of skin problems. Legal: Apothecanna's new range of body lotions (pictured, $36 for a standard bottle) are derived from cannabis flower extracts, which don't produce a high but do reduce pain, swelling and irritation . 'Cannabis extracts are highly effective in treating a variety of muscle, joint, nerve and skin conditions', Apothecanna states. Indeed, the cannabis plant is known to contain more than 400 individual chemicals, some of which have been proven to relieve a multitude of ailments; from epilepsy and multiple sclerosis to the symptoms of AIDS and cancer, when smoked or consumed. Apothecanna combines flower oil extracted from cannabis plants with other natural plant extracts such as grapefruit, peppermint and lavender, to form lotions that are 'powerful anti-inflammatories', capable of reducing swelling, pain, and irritation. Will Rihanna be a fan? Many celebrities who have long been vocal about the healing properties of cannabis, Rihanna among them (pictured), might want to get their hands on the new range of products . The line of products was made possible by Colorado's recent Amendment 64 law which, legalized the recreational use of cannabis in the state. The shipment of Apothecanna products, which are made from medical grade marijuana grown by the company itself, is legal to ship all around the U.S. Some of its more potent 'extra strength' THC-containing concoctions, however, are only available through licensed medical marijuana centers in Colorado. Unlike the products available state-wide, this range is described as not having a 'pronounced' inebriating effect, indicating there may be some level of high. But they do have 'miraculous healing properties not seen anywhere else on the planet', a claim not made for their widely legal range. So for those looking for a proper cannabis-induced skin boost, it might be time for a trip to Colorado.","Apothecanna, based in Colorado, is the first skincare company in the U.S. to legally sell cannabis derived products state-wide .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In recent years we’ve seen popular words on social networks make their way into the dictionary - from selfie to bitcoin. But now a new initiative will see Twitter users decide for themselves what modern words they want to see included. Collins English Dictionary has scoured the microblogging site to find emerging words, and is asking users to vote on which should be added to the next edition of the dictionary. Twitter users are being asked to vote on new words to enter the October 2014 edition of the Collins English Dictionary. Entries must be tweeted with a hashtag by 28 May and include words such as 'adorkable', which means a person who is 'dorky in an adorable way.' Stock image pictured . Lexicographers at Collins spent months scouring Twitter to uncover the most popular terms being used, and have drawn up a shortlist. These include words such as 'adorkable', meaning dorky in an adorable way, to 'felfie' – a farmer who has taken a selfie. The winning word will be announced in June and it will enter the October 2014 edition of the Collins English Dictionary. To vote on a word, users need to tweet using a hashtag of their favourite word - such as #adorkable - by 28 May. And, according to the company’s website, adorkable is currently in the lead, although there is plenty of time for it to change. Adorkable - dorky in an adorable way. Duckface - the traditional 'pouting' facial expression in selfies. Euromaidan - the original pro-Europe protests in Ukraine, named for Maidan Square in Kiev. Fatberg - a large mass of solid waste or grease clogging a sewage system. Felfie - a farmer who has taken a selfie. Fracktivist - an activist who protests against fracking. Gaybourhood - a gay-friendly neighbourhood, such as Castro in San Francisco. Nomakeupselfie - a selfie of a woman without her make-up, posted online to raise awareness for a charity; the masculine equivalent is the makeupselfie. Vaguebooking - posting deliberately vague status updates on a social networking site with the intention of prompting a response. The company said using Twitter to measure a word’s popularity is a natural extension of the way the dictionary is compiled. Words are usually added by analysing their usage across a range of UK and international print and digital media. These are then collated into Collins’ list of definitions, which currently stands at 4.5 billion. ‘Twitter offers us an immediate snapshot of how much a word is used,' said Andrew Freeman, Associate Publishing Director at Colllins. ‘The tried and tested approach to compiling dictionaries has to adapt to embrace the ways in which language is developing through use on social media, and this is a fun way to get Twitter users involved in defining the English language.’ The company said using Twitter to choose a new word is a natural evolution of the process usually used to select new words. Fracktivist, for example, is a word growing in popularity used to describe someone who protests against fracking. Stock image pictured . Ian Brookes, lexicographer and consultant editor to the Collins English Dictionary, added: 'The words that we are asking Twitter users to vote on have been selected from a group of words that were mostly submitted by the public for inclusion in the Collins English Dictionary via [our website].' 'We then looked at the frequency of their usage by analysing the data held in the Collins corpus, which records word usage around the world in newspapers, magazines, TV, radio and online and is the data source we use to compile the dictionary. 'They are all ""bubbling under"" words, in that we would not usually put them in the dictionary at this stage as they have not reached the required level of usage. 'However, when we additionally used Twitter data to look at their profile it was clear that there was a definite pattern of use on Twitter and we could see where they originated from, and how their use has grown and spread geographically. 'In this way, we are harnessing Twitter data to detect and track word development at an early stage.' Brookes added that language has always had to evolve to new developments in society, and this latest initiative is an indication of how important social media has become.","Twitter users are being asked to vote on new words for the 'Twictionary'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . After a high hand in poker or winning big at the horses, you might think it is best to quit while you’re ahead. But new research suggests that winning streaks – or ‘hot hands’ - are real. Once a person wins a bet, they are increasingly likely to win again because they seek out safer bets, claim scientists. On a winning streak: Once someone wins a bet they are increasingly likely to win again because they seek out safer bets, according to a new study. The probability of a first bet winning was 48 per cent, but the final sixth bet was as high as 75 per cent, according to the research . However, the study also found that once you lose a bet, you become increasingly likely to carry on the losing streak, so there is truth in the advice ‘cut your losses’. Researchers from University College London (UCL) demonstrated that people who continue to bet after losing do not even manage to recoup their losses, while winners are more likely to keep winning. The study also found that once you lose a bet, you become increasingly likely to carry on the losing streak (stock image) Mathematicians Juemin Xu and Nigel Harvey examined 565,915 online bets made by 776 people on sports such as horse-racing and football, taking into account timing and winning and losing streaks up to six bets long, The Economist reported. The probability of a first bet winning was 48 per cent and another win after that, 49 per cent, after which the odds improved and the ‘winning streak’ gathered pace. The third bet won 57 per cent of the time, the fourth 67 per cent, the fifth 72 per cent and the sixth 75 per cent – if all the bets paid off and a streak was maintained. However, the statistics showed that life for the losers got steadily worse. After losing a first bet there was a 47 per cent chance of reversing their fortunes, which decreased to 45 per cent for the remaining bets. While some superstitious gamblers might put the phenomenon down to Lady Luck or various superstitions, the mathematicians found that gamblers’ winning streaks increased in length as they began choosing increasingly safer odds to hang on to success. This led them to win more often, even if the financial rewards were not as great. Losers kept on losing as they desperately tried to reverse their fortunes by taking riskier and riskier bets, which made it increasingly likely for their run of back luck to continue. The research revealed that while winning streaks are real, they are as much influenced by a gambler’s behaviour as a lucky throw of the dice or a fast horse. People in Portsmouth are the luckiest in the UK, according to research carried out by Gala Casino. The survey of 1,000 people, which looked at the perception of luck from across the UK, revealed that three quarters of people in Portsmouth consider themselves to be lucky - far higher national average of 47 per cent. Cambridge is the second luckiest in the UK, which 60 per cent of people thinking they are charmed, with Belfast (59 per cent) Birmingham (55 per cent) and Coventry (53 per cent) completing the top five locations. However, those living in Bristol are the least optimistic with 70 per cent of people believing they are unlucky. The age at which most people feel least lucky is 45-54, while half of over 55s surveyed claim they are lucky. Almost a third of Britons claim to be superstitious and a piece of jewellery is the most common charm. People in Newcastle are the keenest on lucky charms with three in 10 people admitting to owning one, while 97 per cent of people living in Sheffield, and 96 per cent in Norwich and Brighton do not own one.","Mathematicians from University College London examined 565,915 online bets made by 776 people to study chains of six bets .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A sea anemone is a tame, plant-like animal that leads a rather boring, slow life at the bottom of oceans or in tidal pools. That is, until a seabird falls into its mouth. And that’s just what happened in this remarkable set of images that shows a young bird in up to its neck inside one of these water predators. Scroll down for video . Here a baby seabird is seen upside down underwater in a Giant Green Anemone having presumably fallen in either from the talons of another bird or from a nest. The bird was thought to have been dead for about two days when it was found in the tidal pool in Cannon Beach, Oregon . In the image, a baby bird of the cormorant species is seen upside down in a tidal pool in Cannon Beach, Oregon. Sea anemones are a group of water-dwelling, predatory animals classified in the phylum cnidaria. The . polyps stick to the sea floor with an adhesive foot called a basal disk . and have a column-shaped body ending in an 'oral disk'. Most measure 0.6 to 1.2 inches (1.5 to three centimetres) in diameter, but some measuring up to 6.5 feet (two metres) have been found. They can have up to a few hundred tentacles. The . creature's mouth is in the middle of its 'oral disk' and is surrounded . by tentacles with cells on them that protect the creatures as well as . let them catch prey. Some of the animals can sting and inject venom into prey such as small fish and shrimp. The . venom is a mixture of toxins that paralyses the prey so it can be moved . to the anemone's mouth for digestion inside its 'gastrovascular . cavity,' which functions like a stomach. Sea anemones are related to corals and jellyfish. Around its neck can be seen a Giant Green Anemone, a common invertebrate. In the middle of the anemone is the mouth, which doubles up as an anus, out of which the bird is sticking. When prey enters the mouth of a sea anemone, a tiny venom-carrying dart shoots out. This kills or stuns the prey, normally fish and shrimp, and allows the sea anemone to chow down slowly but surely on its meal. And in this case it seems the poor bird has been subjected to the full might of the sea anemone. The researchers estimate it was a baby bird as it was too young to have significant plumage, as seen by the balding areas on it. 'Cormorant chicks are featherless at hatching and usually have natal down by 10 days post-hatch,' the researchers write. They also note it was in a state of rigor mortis without noticeable decay or evidence of scavenging. The event occurred in a tidal pool at Haystack Rock in Cannon Beach, Oregon . Exactly how the bird came to be in the water-dweller’s mouth is unknown. The researchers says it’s possible that a Bald Eagle dropped the chick, or it could have simply fallen from its nest. Whether the bird was dead before it fell into anemone as well is up for debate. The researchers say it had been dead for no more than two days, owing to a lack of scavenging by other animals. Events like this are incredibly rare, especially given that sea anemone's are slow-moving animals, and it is only by chance such a situation can occur. When prey falls into the mouth of an anemone, which doubles as its anus, it fires a venomous dart that knocks out or kills its victim . And, before further observations could be made, the tide pool filled with sand the following day and buried the anemone. The event itself is incredibly rare - similar finds made in 2003 and 2007 at the same location are among few known instances of this occurrence. The event occurred last year in Cannon Beach, Oregon, but was only recently explained in a paper in the journal Marine Ornithology.","A bird has been spotted in the process of being eaten by a sea anemone .

"By . Mark Prigg . Altering search results has a major effect on the voting preferences of undecided voters and could swing a close election, researchers have claimed. Researchers analysing an Indian election found undecided voters paid far more attention to search rankings than previously thought. They say search results can alter the outcome by up to 12% in some cases. Researchers analysing an Indian election found undecided voters paid far more attention to search rankings than previously thought. The new study suggests that biased search rankings can be used to fix the outcome of elections in  which the winner is projected to win by a margin up to 2.9%. In the new study, participants were randomly assigned to groups in which search rankings favored either Mr Kejriwal, Mr Gandhi, or Mr Modi in the recent Lok Sabha Elections. Real search rankings and web pages were used, and people were asked to research all the candidates just as they would on Google. The only difference between the groups was the order in which the search results were displayed. The new study suggests that biased search rankings can be used to fix the outcome of races in India in which the winner is projected to win by a margin up to 2.9%. This can be done just by influencing undecided voters who use the internet – a small but important group of voters that is sure to grow in coming years. Studies show that the higher the rank, the more people trust the result, which is why companies are spending billions now to push their products higher. Researchers at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology in California wanted to see if the effect was similar on political candidates. In research conducted last year in the US, researchers found that altering search rankings so they were biased in favor of a candidate could push the preferences of undecided voters toward that candidate by 15% or more. The team carried out a new study in recent weeks with more than 2,000 undecided voters throughout India. The researchers have shown that votes in India can easily be pushed toward one candidate or another by about 12% - double that amount in some demographic groups - enough to determine the outcomes of many close races. 'This is a very serious matter – a real threat to democracy,' says Dr Robert Epstein, lead researcher in the study. 'If two candidates were both trying to push their rankings higher, they would be competing, and that’s fine. 'But if Google, which has a monopoly on search in India, were to favor one candidate, it could easily put that candidate in office by manipulating search rankings, and no one could counter what they were doing. Even if without human intervention the company’s search algorithm favored one candidate, thousands of votes would still be driven to that candidate.' However, Google hit back at the claimed, telling MailOnline: 'Providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of Google's approach to search from the very beginning. 'Our results reflect what's on the web, and we rigorously protect the integrity of our algorithms. 'It would undermine people's trust in our results and company if we were to change course.' The researchers have shown that votes in India can easily be pushed toward one candidate or another by about 12% by search engine rankings . In the new study, participants were randomly assigned to groups in which search rankings favored either Mr Kejriwal, Mr Gandhi, or Mr Modi.

This can be done just by influencing undecided voters who use the internet – a small but important group of voters that is sure to grow in coming years. Google says its ranking algorithm uses over 200 signals to give you the most relevant answers to your question - be that links to websites, a photograph, a news story, a video, a book or a direct answer. 'We continue to finesse these algorithms and make over 800 changes a year to ensure the best results,' the firm says. The average query response time is roughly a quarter of a second - with the average blink of an eye is a tenth of a second.Examples of these signals include: •    Freshness and quality of content on the webpage•    Synonyms of words in your search query•    Whether the best result is a webpage, images, video, news article, etc.•    The number (and quality) of other websites linking to the particular website•    Spell check . The firm also constantly tweaks its methods, and says it made more than 890 improvements to search quality in 2013. Overall, over 1,000 person-years have gone into developing the Google search algorithm. Source: Google . Worldwide, the researchers say, upwards of 25% of national elections are won by margins under 3%. The study also shows that certain demographic groups are especially vulnerable. The voting preferences of 19% of women over 35 were shifted in the study, as were the voting preferences of 18% of voters who were unemployed. 'Of particular concern,' says Dr Epstein, 'is the fact that 99% of the people in our study seemed to be unaware that the search rankings they saw were biased. 'That means Google has the power to manipulate elections without anyone suspecting they’re doing so. 'To prevent undue influence, election-related search rankings need to be regulated and monitored, as well as subjected to equal-time rules.'","Search ranking artificially biased as an experiment  - and changed the preferences of undecided voters by 15% .

"By . Emma Innes . A super-slimmer lost an incredible 19st in just 18 months after his wife joked he looked like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars. Alan Oates weighed a massive 33st 7lbs and had a 68 inch waist. He was so large he needed additional oxygen for 15 hours a day to help him breathe. Alan Oates, 55, decided to overhaul his diet and lifestyle when he saw this unflattering picture of himself . Mr Oates lost 19st to drop from 33st 7lbs to 14st 4lbs in 18 months - he was losing more than a stone a month . The former lorry driver piled on the pounds munching on fry ups, fish and chips, crisps, curries and Chinese takeaways. But the 55-year-old revealed that it was a picture of him balancing a tiny-looking laptop on his enormous stomach that made him realise he needed to change his ways. He joined Slimming World in January 2012 and has now dropped to a much healthier 14st 4lbs. His incredible diet led to him losing the equivalent of more than a stone every month. ‘I've got a new lease of life,’ said Mr Oates. ‘My wife tells me she has finally got her husband back. ‘My wife has a photo of me which I hate. My laptop is balancing on my big belly, and she joked that I look like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars in it. Mr Oates piled on the pounds gorging on ready meals, takeaways, fry ups and crisps . The former soldier lost weight by joining Slimming World and taking up swimming and running . ‘It was taken in January 2012, around the time I joined Slimming World. I hate that picture. ‘If I had known I looked that big before I may have done something sooner.’ The father-of-one from Tamworth, who is now a transport planner, admits he piled on the pounds after leaving the army in 1988 and becoming a lorry driver. He said: ‘I started eating loads of rubbish food - takeaways, crisps, and fast food, and doing zero exercise. ‘I would spend two or three nights a week away from home and would end up getting takeaways because it was easy. Before his weight loss, Mr Oates was so unhealthy he needed extra oxygen 15 hours a day to help him breathe . Mr Oates (pictured with his wife, Helen) said: 'I've got a new lease of life. My wife tells me that she has finally got her husband back' ‘When I got home my wife would be at work, so I would get something processed out of the freezer - it was laziness. ‘In the end, I struggled with a short walk round the supermarket.’ A typical day would have seen Mr Oates eat nothing until 11am, when he would have a bacon and egg sandwich, closely followed by lunch of fish and chips then dinner of a processed ready meal. His only hobby was his twice-weekly after dinner darts matches at the pub, where he would have another meal. Eventually, persuaded by his wife Helen, 51, Mr Oates visited a doctor who suggested a gastric band. But he refused, and determined to lose the weight himself, he visited Slimming World with his friend Penny in January 2012. Mr Oates was named the second 'Greatest Loser 2014' at a Slimming World ceremony in London (pictured) ‘I think gastric bands are a short fix. I know of people who have had them and afterwards they return to their old eating habits,’ he said. ‘I knew I had to change my lifestyle, rather than have a short-term fix.’ Following the new eating plan, Mr Oates ditched the crisps and fried food, and began cooking from scratch. He swapped the stodgy dinners and fatty fry ups for fruit and stuck religiously to healthy Slimming World recipes. And his hard work paid off. When he was at his heaviest, Mr Oates was offered a gastric band but he turned down the offer as he viewed it as a short-term solution. He decided he needed to change his lifestyle instead . On May 7 this year Mr Oates was named the second 'Greatest Loser 2014' at a Slimming World ceremony in London. He said: ‘I was made to feel really welcome at the group, and I lost 12lbs in the first week. I still go every week religiously.’ Now Mr Oates has also had a lifestyle overhaul, and enjoys walking and swimming with his wife. He said: ‘We still have a Sunday roast dinner every week, but we cook it differently. ‘I walk nearly everywhere now, whereas before I would drive the two minute walk to the shop because I would be out of breath. ‘There's no way I'm putting this weight back on!’","Alan Oates, 55, dropped from 33st 7lbs to 14st 4lbs in just 18 months .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Astronomers believe they have found the sun’s ‘long-lost brother’ – a stellar body born from the same gas cloud as our own star. The researchers claim there is even a ‘small’ chance that this solar sibling could host planets that harbour life. But even if its solar system proves barren, the discovery could help scientists find other stellar twins that may help shed light on how our sun formed. The University of Texas says the star, called HD 162826, is 15 per cent more massive than our sun and located 110 light-years away in the constellation Hercules. The star is not visible to the unaided eye, but easily can be seen with low-power binoculars, not far from the bright star Vega . The sun’s ‘long-lost brother' is a star called HD 162826. It is a star 15 per cent more massive than the sun, located 110 light-years away in the constellation Hercules. The star is not visible to the unaided eye, but can be seen with low-power binoculars, not far from the bright star Vega. ‘We want to know where we were born,’ Professor Ivan Ramirez from the University of Texas at Austin said. ‘If we can figure out in what part of the galaxy the sun formed, we can constrain conditions on the early solar system. That could help us understand why we are here.’ In their earliest days, collisions could have knocked chunks off of planets, and these fragments could have travelled between solar systems. These may have been responsible for bringing primitive life to Earth. Or, fragments from Earth could have transported life to planets orbiting solar siblings. Scientists believe the stellar body was born from the same gas cloud as our own sun (pictured). The researchers claim there is a 'small' chance that this solar sibling could host planets that harbour life . Gaia’s goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the Milky Way. It will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about 1% of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home Galaxy to help answer questions about its origin and evolution. Repeatedly scanning the sky, Gaia will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years. In addition to positions and motions, Gaia will also measure key physical properties of each star, including its brightness, temperature and chemical composition. Eventually, the Gaia data archive will exceed a million Gigabytes, equivalent to about 200 000 DVDs of data. ‘So it could be argued that solar siblings are key candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life,’ Professor Ramirez said. The solar sibling his team identified is a star called HD 162826, a star 15 per cent more massive than the sun, located 110 light-years away in the constellation Hercules. The star is not visible to the unaided eye, but easily can be seen with low-power binoculars, not far from the bright star Vega. While the finding of a single solar sibling is intriguing, Professor Ramirez points out that the project has a larger purpose: to create a road map for how to identify solar siblings, in preparation for the flood of data expected soon from surveys like Gaia. ‘The idea is that the sun was born in a cluster with a thousand or a hundred thousand stars. 'This cluster, which formed more than 4.5 billion years ago, has since broken up,’ he said. The member stars have broken off into their own orbits around the galactic center, taking them to different parts of the Milky Way today. A few, like HD 162826, are still nearby. Others are much farther afield. The data coming soon from Gaia is ‘not going to be limited to the solar neighborhood,’ Professor Ramirez said. ‘The number of stars that we can study will increase by a factor of 10,000,’ he said . The project hopes to create a road map for how to identify solar siblings, in preparation for the flood of data expected soon from surveys like Gaia. Pictured is the young star cluster NGC1818 taken as part of calibration and testing before the science phase of the Gaia telescope mission begins . He says his team’s road map will speed up the process of winnowing down the field of potential solar siblings. 'Don’t invest a lot of time in analyzing every detail in every star,' he said. 'You can concentrate on certain key chemical elements that are going to be very useful.' These elements are ones that vary greatly among stars, which otherwise have very similar chemical compositions, and are largely dependent on where in the galaxy the star formed. Ramirez’s team has identified the elements barium and yttrium as particularly useful. Once many more solar siblings have been identified, astronomers will be one step closer to knowing where and how the sun formed. To reach that goal, the dynamics specialists will make models that run the orbits of all known solar siblings backward in time to find where they intersect: their birthplace.","The star, named HD 162826, is 15 per cent more massive than our sun .

"New users of Google's Glass have taken to Twitter to complain of headaches caused by their $1500 gadgets - and even Google's own medical advisor was today forced to admit the problem. Users have complained of headaches and sharp pains caused by the device, which places a small screen at the top right of the user's field of vision. Google's medical adviser says the problem is because of the placement of the screen, and warned new users to 'take it easy' as they adjust. Scroll down for video . It is believed the placement of the screen is causing the issues for some new users. Google last week put its controversial eyewear back on sale to the US public. The firm is offering the 'explorer edition', the $1500 test version of the eyewear, for general sale after an initial 24 hour sale sold out. Buyers can visit http://google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one to buy Glass. 'Any adult in the US can become an Explorer by visiting our site and purchasing Glass for $1500 + tax – and it now comes with your favorite shade or frame, thanks to feedback from our current Explorers. Source: Google . The problems emerged as Twitter users spoke of their pain after wearing the product. 'Personally, it gives me a headache everytime I wear it, wrote twitter user Rohan Chandrashekhar. 'Not to mention, the eye damage all that squinting is likely to cause.' Another user, Paul Bilodeau, tweeted: 'Got my Glass headache. 'It's going to take some getting used to.' Writers from Tech blog Betabeat also claim they suffered issues when first using the device. 'After Betabeat tried Google Glass for the first time at Google HQ in New York, both writers experienced a sharp pain after about ten minutes, which went away shortly after we took it off,' they wrote. Dr. Eli Peli, the Harvard optometrist who consults for Google on the project, said the problem was people getting used to the screen position. 'The only people who look up a lot are some professionals like electricians and painters,' Dr. Peli told Betabeat. 'If you’re looking at the Glass for a minute, you’re holding it there for sixty times longer than normal.' The pain goes away for most users after a few days to a week, Dr. Peli said, as the muscles around the eye adapt. 'The recommendation is to not overdo it when you start,' he said. 'Use it in the recommended way right from the beginning.' Some users have called for clearer warnings to be given for new users. Google told MailOnline: 'When anyone gets a new pair of Glasses or starts wearing them for the first time there is always an adjustment period until people get used to them. 'For some it's the same with Glass. 'We encourage Explorers to ease into Glass, just as they would a new pair of glasses. 'As we note in our Help Center, Glass is designed for micro-interactions, not for staring into the screen, watching Friday night movie marathons or reading ‘War and Peace.' Next generation: Google Glass has revealed the new look of its high-tech device . Google last week put its controversial eyewear back on sale to the US public. The firm is offering the 'explorer edition', the $1500 test version of the eyewear, for general sale after an initial 24 hour sale sold out. It is believed the firm wants to increase the number of people people using the hardware - and potentially clear its inventory for the 'real' consumer version. The firm announced a 24 hour sale last month after its plans were leaked, and the device sold out within hours. Today, it reappeared online for sale to anyone if what is described as an 'open beta'. 'Whoops. So... we’d planned to post this next week, but it looks like the cat's out of the bag now,' Google said when its previous plans were leaked.. 'Over the past several months, we’ve been trying out different ways to expand the Explorer program. 'Our Explorers are moms, bakers, surgeons, rockers, and each new Explorer has brought a new perspective that is making Glass better. 'But every day we get requests from those of you who haven’t found a way into the program yet, and we want your feedback too. 'So in typical Explorer Program fashion, we’re trying something new. ' Stylish: The frames will be available in a range of colors and will work with prescription glasses . Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device. With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme. Reaction to the new design was mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. The secret document obtained by The Verge that reveals the plan . However, the updates were welcomed by those who have a first-generation device, with comments on its Google + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience. One owner, Dawn Martin, commented: 'My glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because I can't hear it well enough ... yay for updates/upgrades!' Improved: The slightly bulkier design comes with a detachable ear piece to improve commands . Upgrade: Big Bang Theory's Kunal Nayyar wearing the Google Glass at the Emmys in September. Those with the earlier design will be able to swap their old device for the new one . Another fan of the device, Jeremiah Townsend, commented: 'Can't wait ... now that we'll be able to use them with prescription glasses, they'll be glued to my face.'﻿ . Others however complained that the device was still not widely available. Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!' However, the Google Explorer program has been praised for using a clever marketing model where people buy a product at its developmental stage so they can contribute to shaping its design. 'In essence Google has crowdfunded Glass and has shown big business how crowdfunding can be done. In essence it is a giant kickstarter campaign in all but name,' according to Forbes. It estimated that Google would have earned about $50 million during the development phase as well as enhancing the desirability of the product.","Users have complained on Twitter of sharp pains and headaches .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In January more than 200 people sent Esa video selfies for their ‘Rosetta Wake Up’ campaign. This was an international video shout-out to celebrate the end of 31 months of deep-space hibernation for Esa’s Rosetta spacecraft, currently on its way to a comet. And now Esa plans to send some of the messages into space on a trip out of the solar system. Scroll down for a video compliation of the selfies . Esa is sending 10 video selfies into deep space via a transmission from a tracking station in Spain. This will include the entry from Ellinogermankiki Agogi Primary School in Greece, pictured, which won the 'Rosetta Wake Up' competition with 10,508 votes . The endeavour will be carried out by Cerebos, Esa’s 115ft (35 metres) deep-space tracking station at Cebreros, Spain. The station will transmit a 35-megabyte archive filed with the top 10 video selfies that were were submitted to Esa during the Rosetta Wake Up campaign. The message will be broadcast into deep space on 15 May 2015. Cerberos is part of Esa’s Estrack network that is used to send and receive data from spacecraft including Mars Express, Venus Express, Rosetta and Gaia, the latter of which is currently compiling a 3D catalogue of one billion objects in the Milky Way. On their website Esa says it’s difficult to know how far the signal will go, ‘given the low-ish transmit power and the probability of being attenuated to undetectable levels in the future.’ Travelling at light speed, the signal will pass the moon’s orbit in one second. After four hours it will be beyond Neptune, and 10 months later it will pass through the Oort cloud of comets that surround the sun. In 20,000 years it will leave the Milky Way and, ultimately, in 13.8 billion years it will reach the edge of the observable universe that we can see from Earth today. 1 second .

The spaececraft will enter orbit around the comet this month and will drop a lander, Philae, onto the surface later this year . To make the transmission, the station will point directly upwards in what the engineers call the ‘Stow’ position. While the station is capable of transmitting at 20 kilowatts, it will use a two kilowatt amplifier in this case. The transmission will start at about 13:40 UK time and will last about three minutes. The bit rate, the speed at which data is transferred, will be about 250 kilobits per second. Although significantly slower than a home internet connection (which is about 5,000 to 10,000 kilobits per second), it is much faster than spacecraft transmission. For example, transmission to Rosetta is two kilobits per second, while Gaia is four kilobits per second. Esa has invited a group of students from Colegio Público (Peñaluenga) De El Castillo De Las Guardas near Seville to help with the event. The Cerberos station is situated near Madrid, Spain. It is one of the world's most sophisticated and technically advanced tracking stations used for satellite control, and is capable of communicating with missions orbiting as far away as Jupiter .","Esa is planning to send ten video selfies from the public into deep space .

"By . James Rush . They say you should fight fire with fire... and now scientists in Australia are doing exactly that by developing a method of using explosives to help prevent wildfires from raging out of control. Dr Graham Doig has been investigating the technique which sees the shockwave and subsequent rush of air from . a controlled explosion knock the flame from its fuel source - just like . blowing out a candle, but on a much bigger scale. Dr Doig, of the University of New South Wales, travelled to an explosive test site in a remote part of New Mexico, in the U.S., in a bid to examine how the blast from an explosion can put out fires. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scientists in Australia are developing a method of using the shockwave from an explosion to put out fires . Australian engineer Dr Graham Doig has been testing the method, which sees the initial shockwave disrupt the flame before the subsequent rush of air knocks it off its fuel source . Within milliseconds of being knocked off the fuel source, the flame is extinguished . He said the method may be able to be . used to help prevent wildfires from spreading by stopping the flames . from reaching and taking control of the treetops. Dr Doig told MailOnline: 'Ideally you want to stop the fire getting into the treetops because that's when it takes control. 'Once . it moves into the treetops, that is the big problem, so we have been . thinking in terms of having another tool in the toolbox that . firefighters can use to get something under control and then get in . there with water-bombing and firefighters on the ground. 'Conventional . firefighting needs things under control - if the fire's in the treetops, . that's when it's most often not under control.' Dr . Doig travelled to the Energetic Materials Research Testing Centre where . he filmed the technique in action using high speed video to investigate . exactly how it worked. In a statement he said: 'The sudden . change in pressure across the shockwave, and then the impulse of the . airflow behind it pushed the flame straight off the fuel source. Dr Doig said the method may be able to be used to help prevent wildfires from spreading by stopping the flames from reaching and taking control of the treetops . 'As soon as the flame doesn't have access to fuel anymore, it stops burning.' The . technique of blowing out a fire has been used in the oil and gas . industry to put out blazes in wells for a number of years, but Dr Doig . is now investigating how this technique can be used to tackle fires in open spaces. He said . one potential way of using the technique to tackle wildfires would be to . carry the explosive charge into place by helicopter.

Dr Doig said one potential way of using the technique to tackle wildfires would be to carry the explosive charge into place by helicopter . He said: 'Of course as soon as the blast happens you'd want to detach the explosives from the helicopter. 'But helicopter transport would allow you to position the blast somewhere where people couldn't otherwise get in easily.' Dr Doig said the method was not a 'magic bullet' to defeat wildfires, but he hoped it could be a way of preventing them becoming out of control and to aid more conventional firefighting techniques.","Australian engineer investigating how to use explosives to put out fire .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A first impression about can be formed in as little as a tenth of a second, but it is possible to influence what judgement is made. Scientists have discovered that people with faces that others don’t trust can pull an expression to make them appear more honest. Faces deemed untrustworthy, dominant or unattractive because of their shape can be made to appear the opposite by making specific facial expressions. Fake it to make it: Faces deemed untrustworthy, dominant or unattractive because of their shape can be made to appear the opposite by making specific facial expressions, scientists have said. An untrustworthy face (pictured left) can be transformed into a trustworthy one (right) by raising the eyebrows and smiling slightly . Researchers used software to generate 3D animated images of faces that can be programmed to move one or more of 42 individual groups of facial muscles. Twelve volunteers judged randomly generated facial expressions on trustworthiness, dominance and attractiveness. From this, the experts pinpointed which aspects of an expression conveyed these particular characteristics. They asked different volunteers to rate faces with neutral expressions for the same traits based solely on facial structure. To test whether the neutral faces deemed untrustworthy, dominant or unattractive could be made to appear trustworthy, submissive and attractive, they animated the second set of faces with the expressions identified with these characteristics from the first experiment. Faces thought to look untrustworthy could be made more honest-looking by activating a few muscle groups to form a more virtuous expression and dominant faces could appear meeker. This ‘social camouflage’ can be used by people with untrustworthy faces to override the default impression others form by looking at their face. For example, raising the eyebrows and smiling slightly can make someone appear more honest, while wrinkling the nose slightly can affect a look of dominance. ‘Humans communicate a lot through their facial expressions when negotiating various social situations,’ said Dr Daniel Gill, a psychologist of Glasgow University. ‘But whether we like it or not, previous well-documented research has shown people tend to perceive certain personality characteristics or traits in individuals based on the structure of their face. ‘This means some people can be judged to be untrustworthy or domineering simply by how they look - a square jaw and large brow conveying dominance for example. 'Social camouflage' can be used by people with untrustworthy faces to override the default impression others form by looking at their face. Here, the facial movements required to look more or less dominant are shown . ‘It can have implications for things like mate selection and job opportunities. ‘However there are also basic facial movements people identify with specific social traits and these movements can override the default impression people have of another person's face.’ To appear more trustworthy, people should raise their inner and outer brow and smile slightly with their mouth closed to show dimples, according to the study. Dr Gill said: ‘If you're going for a job interview it's best to feign happiness and surprise because this looks more honest to an observer. ‘But an army commander would put on a sterner, more dominant look than someone who is going out for a romantic encounter.’ A more dominant look can be achieved by wrinkling the nose and raising the upper lip so the mouth is open slightly. Dr Gill explained that people often adopt these faces without realising it and that animals do the same thing. Dr Gill said that there are also basic facial movements people identify with specific social traits - such as trustworthiness (pictured - and these movements can override the default impression people have of another person's face. Lots of people adopt suitable expressions without realising it . ‘Rhesus monkeys for instance have different faces according to their hierarchical rank - the highest ranking have dominant faces while the lesser mortals' are more submissive,’ he said. The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, said that attractiveness is harder to feign. This is because the perception of attractiveness is based on many more factors than just facial expressions, as any casting director will know, Mr Gill explained. ‘An actor can certainly look more dominant or trustworthy according to their role - but would probably struggle to look more attractive. For that you'd really need an attractive actor.’ In the experiment, researchers used software to generate 3D animated images of faces that can be programmed to move one or more of 42 individual facial groups of muscles to pull a certain face. They then asked a group of 12 volunteers to judge a set of randomly generated facial expressions on trustworthiness, dominance and attractiveness. This allowed the researchers to ascertain which aspects of an expression conveyed these particular characteristics. Attractiveness is harder to feign, according to the study. This is because the perception of attractiveness is based on many more factors than just facial expressions, Dr Gill explained . They repeated this procedure again with a different set of volunteers asking them to rate static faces with neutral expressions for the same traits but based solely on facial structure. To test whether the neutral faces deemed untrustworthy, dominant or unattractive could be made to appear trustworthy, submissive and attractive, they animated the second set of faces with the expressions identified with these characteristics from the first experiment. Faces thought to look untrustworthy could be made more honest-looking simply by activating a few muscle groups to form a more virtuous expression. Similarly dominant faces could appear meeker through a different expression. Study co-author Professor Philippe Schyns said: ‘This is the first study to examine how dynamic facial expressions affect the perception of social traits or characteristics.’","Faces deemed untrustworthy, dominant or unattractive because of their shape can be made to appear the opposite by moving certain muscles .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Visitors to London cannot fail to notice the capital’s many layers of history from its rugged Roman walls to elegant Georgian townhouses. And now a group of historians has mapped the evolution of the capital from its roots as a Roman city in 43AD to the modern metropolis we navigate today. The animation begins when London was focused in a square mile – which continued to as late as the 17th century - to the suburban sprawl of the 21st century, which magnified the size of the city to an area of 600 square miles (966km squared). Scroll down for video . A group of historians has mapped the evolution of the the capital from its roots as a Roman city in 43AD to the modern metropolis we navigate today. Here, Roman roads converge in the Square Mile . The etymology of London is uncertain but it is thought that it is Roman in origin. The first recording of the name Londinium dates from the second century. There was a theory that it originated from a 'King Lud' but this has been discarded. Historians in the 17th Century maintained that the city's name is Celtic and means 'place belonging to a man called Londinos,' but again, this theory has been thrown out. In 1998 Richard Coates suggested that London is pre-Celtic for (p)lowonida -  'river too wide to ford' - suggesting that it is named after the River Thames. It could have a Welsh and Roman origin. Until 1889 the name 'London' only applied to the City of London, which was the Roman part of the city, but it now applies to the county and Greater London. It maps the evolution of London’s bustling road network and menagerie of historical, listed buildings, including some of the capital’s most iconic landmarks, such as the Tower of London. London is made up of a mishmash of architectural styles, unlike cities such as Rome, and these are clearly divided into ancient and more recent eras. Created by the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (Casa), the animation shows London’s industrialisation over 2,000 years. The map took nine months to make and is based on datasets from the Museum of London Archaeology, Tudor maps from the Historic Towns Trust and historical maps showing road layouts from the 18th century to present day. These were provided courtesy of the University of Cambridge. While information about the city’s 19,000 listed buildings came from English Heritage and the Ordnance Survey. This artist's impression shows sections of the defensive wall during its construction in the second century AD.The wall  - small sections of which are still standing today -  stretched from the River Thames forming a northern boundary to the town, and incorporated existing buildings including the fort (left foreground) While very little Roman architecture survives above ground, archaeological finds have been protected below the surface of the City, which are marked on this map in red . The network of roads expaned slightly in the Anglo Saxon and medieval period, although the population did not grow as rapidly as it was repeatedly hit with disease and famine . The experts are currently working on a 3D version, which would allow people to step back in time without pounding the busy streets, according to the blog of Polly Hudson, who was involved in the project. In the video, the roads begin in Roman times with arteries converging in Londinium, especially the Square Mile, which is now filled with banks and skyscrapers. They slowly become more intricate, while buildings gradually creep outwards into the countryside. The roads are laid over a light modern map of London, while buildings of a certain period are marked by bright yellow dots. The city was largely abandoned in 410AD by the Saxons who preferred to build large farms, and these formed the basis for places like Chelsea and Hampton. But from the 9th century onwards London was back on its growth trajectory within the Roman walls, with Westminster becoming the first established political centre. While the city started its life squashed into just one square mile, it is now a densely populated metropolis stretching from the City with its sky scrapers to leafier suburbs . London saw a growth in population in the Tudor period to almost 200,000, having previously been ravaged by famine and plague. A lot of development occured during the reign of King Henry VIII who destroyed a lot of the capital's religious sites. Major roads and listed builds are marked on this map . London is made up of a mishmash of architectural styles unlike cities such as Rome, which are clearly divided into ancient and more modern periods. Most Tudor buildings were based in the Square Mile, but Hampton Court Palace, in Greater London was Henry VIII's hunting lodge in the leafy suburbs . Between Roman times and the 17th century, buildings rotted away, burnt down or were deliberately damaged and were rebuilt in the styles of the day. The Great Fire of London in 1666 was responsible for destroying four fifths of the city and so very few medieval buildings remain today. By 1840, London was the most powerful city in the world with a population of 2 million and swathes of elegant Georgian houses and streets were built. However, it was under the reign of Queen Victoria that the city exploded with a population of 6.5 million prospering from the Industrial Revolution. Created by the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (Casa), the animation showing London's industrialisation over 2,000 years. Here, listed Georgian houses and landmarks are marked on the map . By 1840, London was the most powerful city in the world with a population of 2 million and swathes of elegant Georgian houses and streets having been built, such as Bedford Square pictured . Innovations such as steam trains and the London Underground enabled areas of Greater London to be developed for housing, and despite modern town planners between the 1940s and the 1970s demolishing some of the red brick properties, plenty of terraces remain in the suburbs. World War Two decimated many buildings and the population but despite this, the 20th century saw the largest amount of growth in the country’s history. Only the very best examples of 20th century development are protected today. The Lloyds Building is London’s most recently listed building able to be added to the list as it is now over 30 years old.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . How often have you been frustrated by a rotating fan that, after blasting you with a burst of cold air, continues turning to point towards an empty room? Thankfully, one company has a solution. Japanese manufacturer Iris Ohyama has designed a fan with an built-in infrared sensor. It detects when a person is in range, to begin blowing them with air - and will turn itself off if the person leaves the room. Japanese manufacturer Iris Ohyama has released its new automated fan that can track humans with an infrared sensor. It is able to turn up to 85° and blast people with air, rather than other fans that turn and blow into an empty room. If it detects no-one within range for about a minute, it will shut down and stop blowing air . The device is known as the ‘Human-sensing Oscillating Fan’, model number LFDJ-301K. The oscillating fan, pictured, detects a person's presence with its infrared sensor bar. The product is on sale in Japan . It retails in Japan for 18,000 yen ($176; £105) but there are no plans to bring it to other countries just yet. The company claim they expect to sell about 25,000 of the fans by April of next year. The device works by having an infrared sensor bar below the fan. This can sense the heat signature of the area around it. When a human is detected the fan can turn, up to a range of 85°, to blast the person continuously with air. The sensitivity of the sensor can be set at three different levels, to make sure it tracks the right things. It can also track multiple people; if it sees more than one person, it will take turns in pointing towards each of them. If it detects no-one within range for about a minute, it will shut down and stop blowing air. Thus the device is not only handy, especially for hot countries, but it should help cut down on energy usage when it is not being used. Back in March Dyson experts launched a new . bladeless fan that is 75 per cent quieter and eliminates the tone that . equates to the irritating mosquito hum than its previous bladeless fan. However . the sound of silence does not come cheaply - the designer fan ranges . in price from £219.99 to £299.99 ($370 to $500) depending on the size and style. The . company has spent some £40 million ($67 million) on developing its Air Multiplier . bladeless fans, which come from laboratories that employ 1,500 . scientists and engineers. The design for Dyson Cool fans includes an innovation called a Helmholtz . cavity, which effectively dissipates some of the soundwaves caused by . the fan. The engineers . identified which tone was the most irritating to the human ear, which is . equivalent to a mosquito’s beating wind, and have managed to quieten it.","Japanese manufacturer Iris Ohyama has made a fan that tracks movement .

"By . Mark Prigg . It is an incredible view of how the world looked during the ice age. An online mapmaker has revealed a unique map showing the world as it would have looked 14,000 years ago, when the last ice age was at its harshest. Designers worked with geologists to accurately map the massive landbridges and ice sheets that made the world a very different place. The unique map shows the world as it would have looked 14,000 years ago, when the ice age was at its harshest. Designers worked with geologists to accurately map the massive landbridges and ice sheets that made the world a very different place. The world as it looks today: This modern map shows the incredible differences since the ice age . The map was created by Martin Vargic, an amateur graphic designer from Slovakia. 'It is the first map of its kind on such a scale and level of complexity, and depicts our planet as it looked during the late glacial maximum of the last ice age, 14,000 years BCE,' he told MailOnline. 'If I include time devoted to proper research, the map took about a month and a half to be fully finished,'. 'I contacted several university geologists and climatologists who provided me the needed scientific data about the various prehistoric lakes, extent of sea levels, actual size of ice sheets, late pleistocene hydrology, climate and even sea currents in year 14.000 B.C (at the end of the Last Glacial Period, about 2-3 thousand years before the late glacial maximum and massive meltdown). The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) refers to that period in earth's history when the glaciers were at their thickest and the sea levels at their lowest. Martin Vargic, an amateur graphic designer from Slovakia spent six weeks making the map. He worked with university geologists and climatologists, and included data about prehistoric lakes, extent of sea levels, actual size of ice sheets, late pleistocene hydrology, climate and even sea currents in year 14.000 B.C . The maps also show how the climate has changed, using the most accurate records available. The image, which can also be bought as a poster, includes one full large detailed map of the world, 2 major maps showcasing northern and southern polar regions and 2 detailed minimaps comparing present day climate to that during the late glacial maximum. 'I included present day-countries and cities on the map, to help people understand the geography of the Ice Age world and compare it to present more accurately. 'Because of the massive decline of sea levels(caused by the accumulation of water in massive ice sheets), boundaries were extended according to exclusive economic zones and official maritime boundaries. 'I was genuinely surprised about how the climate and geography of the world has changed in only about 16 thousand years(only a fraction of time when compared to Earth's history). 'I plan to make some similarly-themed maps in future, showing the world 65 million and 150 million years ago. At the time of the Pleistocene, the continents had moved to their current positions. At one point during the Ice Age, sheets of ice covered all of Antarctica, large parts of Europe, North America, and South America, and small areas in Asia. In North America they stretched over Greenland and Canada and parts of the northern United States. The remains of glaciers of the Ice Age can still be seen in parts of the world, including Greenland and Antarctica. There was a lot of movement over time, and there were about 20 cycles when the glaciers would advance and retreat as they thawed and refroze. The major effects of the ice age are erosion and deposition of material over large parts of the continents, modification of river systems, creation of millions of lakes, changes in sea level, development of pluvial lakes far from the ice margins, isostatic adjustment of the crust, and abnormal winds. It affects oceans, flooding, and biological communities . Scientists identified the Pleistocene Epoch’s four key stages, or ages — Gelasian, Calabrian, Ionian and Tarantian. The name Pleistocene is the combination of two Greek words: pleistos (meaning “most”) and kainos (meaning “new” or “recent”). It was first used in 1839 by Sir Charles Lyell, a British geologist and lawyer. The world 16,000 years ago was in many ways radically different to the present; because large amounts of water were concentrated in the massive ice sheets covering the majority of North America and western Eurasia, sea levels were about 110 meters lower when compared to today. This exposed  massive land bridges, most notably Beringia, Sundaland and Sahul. Northern hemisphere was covered by two main ice sheets; the Wechselian Ice Sheet, covering the much of northern Europe and western Siberia, reaching as far south as Berlin, and the Laurentine&Cordilleran Ice Sheet complex, which covered almost entire Canada and portions of northern USA. Major ice sheets were also present in mountainous areas, most notably in the Himalayas, Rocky Mountains, Alps and Patagonian Andes.

There is disquiet among the FIFA executive about president Sepp Blatter's unilateral move to spend an alleged £16million funding a film about world football's ruling body. Several members of FIFA’s decision-making committee were unaware that United Passions, charting the history of FIFA and launched at the Cannes Film Festival this week, had been made, let alone that Blatter had spent so much of the organisation’s money on the project. Following Sports Agenda revealing Blatter’s massive investment on what is expected to be a huge box office flop, FIFA powerbrokers have a number of questions for their leader. Trouble: FIFA president Sepp Blatter (second from left) faces questions from members after spending £16million on a film project about the organisation . Namely, why doesn’t FIFA’s funding of the film appear in the latest financial accounts? What allocated budget is the money coming from? And how can the spending be justified when FIFA are cutting costs knowing that the problematic Brazil World Cup is going to be a lot more expensive than first envisaged? Certainly the film issue is likely to impact on Blatter at the FIFA congress in Sao Paulo in three weeks, when he is due to announce his candidature for a fifth term as president. Staying on? Blatter is set to announce his candidature for a fifth term as FIFA president in three weeks . The busy Clare Balding is to replace John Inverdale as presenter of Radio 5 Live’s Wimbledon coverage, with Sports Agenda having written last year that Inverdale would not host the programme following his crass ‘never a looker’ comment about women’s champion Marion Bartoli.

"By . Freya Noble . Incredible footage has emerged of punches being thrown as riot police clashed with student protesters gathered at Sydney University on Thursday night to confront Education Minister Christopher Pyne over cuts announced in last week's Federal Budget. Students bearing signs and placards chanted outside the University's St John's College hall where Mr Pyne was adjudicating the The Howard Debating Cup, hosted by Sydney University Liberal Club. In a video uploaded to YouTube a police officer appears to throw a punch at a male student then shove a female student backwards, as fellow students chanted what has become the catch-cry of recent protests: 'No cuts, No fees, No corporate universities'. In unrelated incidents, others claim to have been assaulted by uniformed officers. Scroll down for video . In a video uploaded to YouTube, an officer looks to be taking a swing at a protestor in a pink shirt (right of shot) A group of protesters demonstrated outside an event at St John's College held by The Sydney University Liberal Club . Students who were at the protests shared their experience on social media with one woman tweeting: 'I was exercising my right to demonstrate and a riot cop punched me in the face harder than I've ever been hit #stjohnsgate. Another said: 'Pretty shaken up after being shoved around by riot cops. Solidarity and love to all those still there #pyneatusyd.' The footage shows protesters scuffling with one officer, and others approach the students and tell them to 'back off.' Soon after, a group of police have created a blockage and a cop on the far left of the line looks to take a swing at a male demonstrator wearing a pink shirt. He can then be seen pushing other students, male and female, and police continue to shout 'Get back! Get back!' The same member of police then stands with his arms outstretched trying to stop people entering the hall, and forcefully sends another student, possibly female and wearing a backpack flying backwards with a strong push. A student, who appears to be female, is sent flying backwards by police (also right of screen) Police could be seen blocking students from entering the building at St John's College . Students can then be seen retracting from the line of riot police, though can still be heard chanting and yelling. ABC reporter Ben Worsley was at the demonstration at Sydney University, and said that a number of protesters were pushed to the ground by officers. 'Within two or three minutes a heavy police presence arrived, probably a couple of dozen police approached the protesters,' Worsley said. 'A number of the protesters were pushed to the ground quite forcefully but the group has refused to leave,' the ABC report. The University of Sydney's SRC newspaper Honi Soit were tweeting as the events were unfolding, which prompted others to join the discussion. Their feed recorded profanities and chants being shouted during the protests, photos of police blocking entrances into St John's College, and revealed that students believe Pyne had to be ushered into the building via and alternative entrance. Protesters could be heard chanting while holding banners outside the university on Thursday night . Riot officers formed a blockade to try and stop protesters they were clashing with . At 8.30pm, 15 protesters remained outside the college, quietly waiting for Mr Pyne to come out. They were debating whether to stay or call it a night, as six police watched on. In total, about 35 police were scattered around the building, guarding its exits. Vice-president of the University of Sydney Union and Greens member Tom Raue was waiting with the crowd. The 23-year-old said students were angry with the 'appalling' budget and wanted to remind Liberals that the cuts would not go unnoticed by ""working class and vulnerable people"". 'Students are going to fight back against the budget and disrupt [Liberals] wherever they go,' he told AAP. Footage shows male and female students being pushed forcefully by police . He criticised police for being 'quite violent' but acknowledged no arrests had been made yet. Christopher Pyne is said to have left the university just before 9pm. Senators George Brandis and Mitch Fifield, and Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson were also on the guest list. The Sydney University Liberal Club condemned the 'violent riot' in a statement on Facebook. President Alex Dore blamed 'extremist' students for interrupting the club's annual John Howard Debating Cup. They had nothing better to do than to disrupt civil debate with their militant tactics, he said. 'The extreme left students chants of `Chris Pyne f*** you', `Pyne is a w*nker' is offensive and has no place in civil society.' The event takes place a day after Mr Pyne and Prime Minister Tony Abbott cancelled a Deakin University appearance because of security concerns.","Students protest new budget at St John's College at USYD .

"By . Quentin Letts . When Tony Blair and Gordon Brown wanted to show us how ‘well’ they were getting on in 2005, Mr Blair gave Mr Brown an ice-cream cone. Yesterday, in the market square of charming Newark, Nottinghamshire, David Cameron bought a slice of Rocky Road biscuit cake and broke off a chunk for Boris Johnson. ‘Go on, Boris, you know you want some.’ Mayor Johnson: ‘Err, well, hmmmn.’ It looked a bit on the dry side. Boris inspected it as a small child may examine a broccoli floret which has been placed on his plate with the words ‘eat your greens’. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Boris Johnson swapped banter about baking as they toured stalls in Newark . The sight of Mr Cameron paying for cakes for his leadership rival drew parallels with the infamous moment Tony Blair bought ice-creams for Gordon Brown before the 2005 general election . Mr Blair's moment of generosity was supposed to end speculation about tensions between the two Labour figures, but he came under intense pressure to name a date for handing over power to Mr Brown . Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron spent several hours together, sharing a joke over a coffee at Newark train station . Travelling back into London on the tube, the Prime Minister caught up on the news while Mr Johnson chatted with aides . Perhaps Boris is on a diet. No way did he want to eat that lump of calories. Sleek Mr Cameron merrily popped it in his mouth and chewed. And chewed. And chewed. Picture framer Steve Buxton, 50, started quizzing him about VAT rates. Mr Cameron had to answer through a mouthful of crumbs. The two Tories had descended on unsuspecting Newark for little more than ten minutes of frenetic handshaking, leaflet-dispensing, smalltalk and ‘selfies’ with voters. It being a Wednesday morning, most of them were pensioners or parents of toddlers. The resignation of Newark’s Tory MP Patrick Mercer after a lobbying scandal has caused a by-election on June 5. In first-term Blairism this was a Labour seat but the main threat to the Tories’ 16,152 majority now comes from Ukip. The purple brigade have chosen for their candidate one Roger Helmer, a septuagenarian former Tory whose views about homosexuality (he is not a fan) have caused a minor to-do. Mr Helmer was yesterday in a coffee shop on the square. Hiding. Mr Cameron indulged in the political tradition of posing with babies while on the campaign trail . Securing victory in Newark will be key to the Tory plan to prove it can see off the threat from Ukip . During a walkabout, Mr Cameron was confronted about government policy on the NHS, crime and schools . Mr Cameron insisted that the government was putting more money into key public services . Between Boris and Dave waddled their party’s candidate, Robert Jenrick, 32, a blinky, prosperous-looking fellow who works for Christie’s auction house. Ladies and Gentlemen, what are we bid for this rare lot, a sighting of the PM alongside Boris, the man who allegedly pants and champs for his job? They arrived via an alley, Boris the shorter and porkier. Mr Cameron glistened with health and was wearing a sun tan. Has he lost weight? What an essay in oneupmanship he is. Around voters he becomes incorrigible, all laughter lines and smoky voice saying ‘well, nice to see you’ and ‘what’s your plan for the day?’, like  Leslie Phillips. ‘Enjoy the sunshine. Ding dong.’ Boris was more staccato, barking ‘vote on June 5th’ and ‘oi - have a leaflet!’ Voters, confronted by Cameron, gawp. When they see Boris they find themselves consumed by merriment. I checked. Yes, his flies were done up. Occasionally Boris strayed from the PM’s orbit but he took care not to lag too far behind, even when detained by women (they flutter to him as bluebottles to an old kipper). Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson are expected to be seen together a lot more in the run-up to the 2015 general election . The PM has described the London Mayor as one of his 'star players' who he wants to see on the national pitch . One told him huskily, ‘you’re the only one who speaks sense’. Boris shot her a longing double-take but then raced off to catch up with Dave, who was chatting up new mum Christina Riley and her baby Jonah, nine and a half months. Jonah dribbled in a thoughtful sort of way. A fruit stall. Fruits? Ukip’s Helmer wouldn’t like that! Melons and cherries. Oh Boris. Mr Cameron hankered to buy some strawberries but the stallholder was busy and the PM could not wait so his £10 note stayed in his hand. An old biddy with a shopping trolley appeared. ‘Good morning!’ cried Mr Cameron. The old girl, like something out of the Dick Emery show, did not even raise her head. She just ploughed on past, intent on reaching a stall selling pansies. A seed stall was advertising hamster food and dog treats. Would Dave buy the faithful Boris some large fat balls (one quid each)? No. But he did pat Boris’s hair when a voter remarked on it. ‘He’s had a hair cut and is looking very good,’ said Mr Cameron. Boris blushed. Only when the PM and mayor had vanished did Mr Helmer appear. It seemed rather unlike Ukip to shy away from a confrontation. The Tories are throwing some effort into Newark. At the railway station I bumped into Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Chief Whip Sir George Young, Bt. Sir George was in civvies, including a wonderfully battered gardening hat.","PM persuades his 'star player' to join him in campaigning outside London .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton has suggested his under-privileged upbringing has made him hungrier for this season's Formula One world title than team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton may now have all the trappings of wealth that come with his celebrity status, but throughout his formative years until the time when he was handed a contract with McLaren from 2007 that was far from the case. Hamilton's surroundings were exceptionally modest, with father Anthony at one stage holding down three jobs in order to pay for his son to travel the country and pursue his early karting ambitions. Taking it easy: Lewis Hamilton leaves the paddock by boat as the world championship leader prepares for Monaco . As for Rosberg, the son of 1982 world champion Keke, he has lived all his years in Monaco, and so it can be claimed he has known nothing other than the good life. Rosberg has even spoken of the times his father walked him to school along roads that form part of the principality's street circuit, scene of this weekend's latest showdown. To that extent, one German newspaper recently suggested Rosberg was too soft to go toe-to-toe with Hamilton over the course of a title fight. As 2008 world champion, and winning the crown in the manner he did - with an overtaking manoeuvre on the final corner of the last lap of the concluding race of the season - it would suggest Hamilton has the killer instinct and can go the distance. 'Let me tell you this: I come from a not-great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad's apartment,' said Hamilton. 'Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats and all these kind of things, so the hunger is different. Home from home: Nico Rosberg grew up in Monaco and used to walk the roads which form the tracks to get to school . 'I want to be the hungriest guy in the cockpit from all 22 of us - even if every driver has to believe he's the hungriest. 'If I were to come here believing Nico is hungrier than me then I might as well go home. So I've got to be the hungriest. To win the world championship you need to be the hungriest.' Hamilton goes into Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix with a slender three-point cushion over Rosberg after winning the last four grands prix in which the German has been runner-up. On a rain-affected practice day, Hamilton and Rosberg again led the field, with the Briton just 0.032secs ahead of the 28-year-old. That was despite what Hamilton has described as a 'frantic' start as he has revealed he 'overslept', resulting in him being seen jogging to the track minutes prior to the start of FP1. That did not stop Hamilton drawing first blood with Rosberg, who a year ago achieved a clean sweep in finishing top of the times in all three practice sessions and qualifying before winning the race. All eyes on me: Hamilton leads the drivers' standings by three points from Rosberg after four straight wins . Hamilton is now eager to claim what would remarkably be his first pole position in eight attempts here, even though he is fourth on the all-time standings with 35 to his name. And Hamilton has made no secret of the fact as to how he would like matters to unfold on Sunday in a bid to put daylight between himself and Rosberg. Asked by the official website, formula1.com, as to what would be his dream result, Hamilton replied: 'Finishing first, Fernando (Alonso) finishing second and Sebastian (Vettel) finishing third. That would be it for me. The dream result for the team would be the Mercedes cars finishing one-two, and one of those guys in third. Come second practice, and after a heavy downpour beforehand, there was virtually no activity for 40 minutes, much to the derision of the fans who made their feelings plain. The drivers, however, were not keen to risk an accident, and it was only in the last few minutes the disgruntled spectators saw a full complement of cars on a dry track.","Lewis Hamilton says his modest upbringing in Stevenage is vastly different to the formative years Nico Rosberg spent in Monaco .

"By . Lydia Warren . Caught: Jerry Pocklington, 29, planned to hide with his stepdaughter until they could marry . A 29-year-old registered sex offender has been arrested after running away with his 14-year-old stepdaughter, with whom he started a sexual relationship a year ago. Jerry Pocklington, who is still married to the girl's mother, allegedly told police that he had planned to run away with her to New York and keep her there for four years until she was old enough to legally wed. But rather than heading north from their home in Litchfield, Illinois, they fled east on May 14 and hitchhiked to St Louis, Missouri before traveling to nearby Maryland Heights. 'While they were walking, they arrived at the rear of an . area business, they found an unlocked van, they spent the night in the . van Thursday evening,' Maryland Heights Detective Sgt. Rich .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Police investigating Aaron Hernandez's involvement in a double homicide case are asking for tattoo artists to come forward who may have inked the former New England Patriots tight end's right arm between February 2012 and June 2013. The Suffolk district attorney's office has stressed that the tattoo artists are not suspected of any wrongdoing, but are considered potential witnesses who ‘may have made observations of evidentiary value.’ Both of Hernandez's arms are covered with tattoos, but police believe that tattoos added to the ex-NFL star's right arm may offer clues to his role in several murders. Investigators are asking for help from tattoo artists who may have inked former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez's right arm between February 2012 and June 2013 . During the period under investigation Hernandez had a series of star tattoos added, see photo on the right, that weren't present a year earlier when he had played in Super Bowl XLVI in Feb 2012 . Hernandez is charged in three killings. He is scheduled to be arraigned on May 28 on two counts of murder for . allegedly shooting two men - Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado - in . Boston in 2012, prosecutors said on Wednesday. Authorities . have not said if there is any connection between those two slayings and . the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player whose . body was found in an industrial area near Hernandez's home in North . Attleborough. Lloyd was dating Hernandez's fiancee's sister. Authorities didn't describe which of his tattoos they are referring to in seeking artists' help, but photographic evidence suggests that Hernandez had a series of stars added to a design on his right forearm during the period under investigation. Authorities specifically mentioned several places in their quest for tattoo artists: Hermosa Beach, California; Bristol, Connecticut; Palm Beach and Miami, Florida; Massachusetts; and Rhode Island. Tattoo you: Aaron Hernandez was arraigned on charges of murder and weapons violations after being arrested in June 2013 and now cops want to speak to anyone who may have inked him in the previous 18 months . Hernandez, 24, has been indicted on two counts of first-degree murder and other offenses in the July 2012 killings of Daniel de Abreu, right, and Safiro Furtado, left, in Boston . Crime scene: Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were shot to death near the intersection of Herald Street and Shawmut Avenue in Boston in July 2012 . Tattoos are commonly used among criminals to show gang membership and record the wearer's personal history — such as their skills, specialties, accomplishments and convictions. Certain designs have developed recognized coded meanings. The code systems can be quite complex and because of the nature of what they encode, the tattoo designs are not widely recognized. When Hernandez was first imprisoned his body was examined for gang tattoos by officers from the Bristol County House of Correction's gang intelligence unit. They also interviewed Hernandez about any past gang affiliations. Hernandez has denied ever being part of a gang and at that time officers determined that none of his tattoos were gang-related. Hernandez's lawyers have said that their client looks forward to his day in court. He is being held without bail. Hernandez, 24, has been indicted on two counts of first-degree murder and other offenses in the July 2012 killings of de Abreu and Furtado in Boston. A third man was wounded in that attack, while two others escaped unharmed. Hernandez and an associate had an ‘encounter’ in a city nightclub with the victims before the shooting, prosecutors said. After the men left, Hernandez followed in an SUV and pulled up alongside the men as their vehicle was stopped at a red light, and opened fire, Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley said. Conley said there was no evidence that Hernandez knew the victims prior to that evening. Weeks after the double shooting, Hernandez signed a five-year deal worth about $40 million with the New England Patriots and went on to play 12 games as a tight end that season. A spokesman for the Patriots said the team had no comment. The tattoo artists are not suspected of any wrongdoing, but are considered potential witnesses who 'may have made observations of evidentiary value,' said police . Hernandez is scheduled to be arraigned on May 28 on two counts of murder for allegedly shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston in 2012 . Hernandez was initally arrested in connection with the 2013 shooting death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd . 'Under our system of justice, Aaron Hernandez is innocent of these charges, and he looks forward to his day in court,' said his lawyers, Charles Rankin and James Sultan, in a statement. Alluding to a news conference held by Conley to announce the charges, the attorneys said they would not try the case in the media. Conley said the investigation of the Boston killings moved forward after the Lloyd case, which will be tried separately in another Massachusetts court. He noted the discovery in Bristol, Connecticut, of the car Hernandez was driving the night the men died and the recovery of the alleged murder weapon from an unnamed person with ties to Hernandez. Conley declined to say whether authorities suspected any connection between the Boston and North Attleborough shootings. Families of the victims have filed civil lawsuits in February against Hernandez seeking $6 million for the wrongful deaths of the two men. Hernandez was cut by the Patriots hours after his arrest in the Lloyd case, and head coach Bill Belichick later said he was 'shocked and disappointed' upon learning of the criminal investigation.","Investigators believe that tattoos Aaron Hernandez had inked between Feb 2012 and June 2013 may offer clues to his role in several murders .

"By . James  Nye . Frontier Airlines says 13 of its flights from Denver International Airport have been canceled because its aircraft were damaged by hail. All flights were grounded on Wednesday afternoon because of a tornado warning and severe thunderstorms that brought hail and strong winds to the area. There were delays of about an hour and a half after operations resumed. At least one tornado touched down in the town of Watkins, southeast of the airport, but no injuries were reported. Touchdown: The huge tornaddo touched down just outside Denver International Airport . Supercell: A pedestrian runs for safety as a hail storm hits downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado on Wednesday . Hail the size of ping pong balls sent pedestrians running for cover in Colorado Springs, and cars slid on the hail on Interstate 70 in Aurora. The hail piled up several inches deep, dented cars and broke windows out of some homes. Officials used snow plows to clear the hail from the main airport access road. At least four tornadoes were spotted in the region, but no significant damage was reported. Damage: A hail storm hits downtown Colorado Springs on Wednesday as extreme weather struck in the afternoon . Severe: The weather system over Colorado is known as the 'Denver cyclone' and cases winds up to 60 mph . A tornado watch was in effect until 8 p.m. for Denver and 10 surrounding counties, as well as Goshen, Laramie and Platte counties in southeastern Wyoming. The storms dropped heavy rain and hail around the Denver area. Tornado sirens rang across Denver and surrounding communities. The storms were fueled by southeasterly winds fueled by a pattern known locally as the Denver cyclone - causing swirling winds of up to 60 mph. According to the National Weather Service heavy 'half-dollar' sized hail fell in the area and residents near to Aurora, Bennett, Manila Village, Watkins and Buckley Air Force Base were advised to take cover. 'Denver's kind of in the clear right now unless something else develops,' said Jim Kalina of the Weather Service in Boulder.","Denver was put under a rare tornado warning Wednesday afternoon as a severe weather pattern passed over the Mile-High City .

"By . James  Nye . Settlement: Dr. Sharon Giese has agreed to pay $2.3 million to the family of a 32-year-old mother-of-two who died following surgery performed by her in June 2009 . A high profile Manhattan plastic surgeon who was endorsed by Dr.Oz settled for $2.3 million with a widower after his wife and the mother of his two children died following liposuction. Dr. Sharon Giese, 49, carried out the 2009 fat-reduction procedure on 32-year-old Adriana Porras, who died from a pulmonary embolism two days later. Her husband, Pablos Balzola, 39, sued Stanford University-educated Dr. Giese in October 2009, claiming the cosmetic surgeon was negligent and did not return emergency phone calls when his wife began to suffer complications. Pathologist Mark Taff said in Manhattan Supreme Court that if Porras had been treated quickly for shortness of breath and chest pains, her 'chance of survival would have been substantially increased.' Giese's defense claimed that the clot traveled to her long 20-30 seconds before she lost her life, leaving 'no time to treat it,' according to The New York Post. However, it emerged that Giese did not heed her own medical protocols by performing the procedure in her own East 61st Street home office rather than at a hospital. Star team: Dr. Sharon Giese is a regular contributor to the Dr Oz show and is seen here with Dr. Mehmet Oz . The $2.3 million settlement was reached in April and made public in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday. The payout will be split between, Balzola, his two children and his attorney. Around $750,000 will go to Porras' six-year-old daughter, Maia and nine-year-old son, Nicholas. Lawyer, Elise Hagouel Langsam will get $365,000 in legal fees and the remainder to Balzola.

She has also appeared on the Today show and teaches at SUNY in Brooklyn, New York City. She has declined to comment personally on the matter. According to her website, Dr. Giese has been at the forefront of groundbreaking research on the effects of liposuction and cardiac risk factors. The research has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, CBS News and NBC new. She is also described as a nationally recognized expert on weight loss surgery and is affiliated with Lennoz Hill Hospital and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.","Dr. Sharon Giese settled for $2.3 million following the death of mother two days after cosmetic surgery in 2009 .

"By . Mark Duell . Crash: Perri Game, 21, was jailed in Surrey after she admitted dangerous driving and drink driving . A care worker slammed her car into a police roadblock while drunkenly driving the wrong way down a dual carriageway at 60mph, a court heard today. Perri Game, 21, ploughed into unmarked police vehicles, which had blocked the three lane carriageway to try to stop her dangerous driving. But instead of slowing down, Game - who was twice the legal alcohol limit for driving - ignored the patrol vehicles’ headlights and carried on with her journey on the A3 at Burpham, Surrey. She then crashed into the police cars, injuring the officers and writing off two vehicles, before ricocheting into the central reservation. A judge today jailed Game, of Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, for four months after she admitted dangerous driving and drink driving. Judge Christopher Critchlow, sitting at Guildford Crown Court, was told that Game could not remember why she had got behind the wheel that night or why she had decided to travel to Staines, Surrey, on January 29. However, she said she may have been going to see a friend to celebrate getting a job. Game was also banned from driving for three years and ordered to pay court costs of £630. The judge said: ‘The only way that a major accident could be avoided and one that could have been serious or fatal, was for the police cars to block the middle and outside lanes of the southbound carriageway and you went into that police car at quite a speed. Recording: Game (circled in her car) ignored the patrol vehicles' headlights and carried on driving on the A3 . ‘Fortunately you were not too badly injured and the police officers were not either. This must be behaviour that the court punishes in this way, as it was such a bad example. I accept that you are ashamed and remorseful.’ Acting Chief Inspector Richard Mallett of Surrey Police said today that the two officers’ actions were brave and had prevented someone being killed. Police constables Simon Down and Ed Stock were on patrol in the early hours when they were told a car had been seen entering the southbound carriageway of the A3. After getting in front of traffic and bringing it to a halt, they created the road block and saw Game speeding towards them at around 60mph. Damage: Game said she not remember why she had got behind the wheel that night or why she had decided to travel to Staines - but added that she may have been going to see a friend to celebrate getting a job . Smash: She crashed into the police cars, injuring the officers and writing off two cars, before ricocheting into the central reservation . Chief Inspector Mallett said: ‘The video clearly shows the risks that our officers face in the course of carrying out their duties and demonstrates the bravery shown by Simon and Ed that morning. 'Fortunately you were not too badly injured and the police officers were not either' Judge Christopher Critchlow . ‘Their decisive action almost certainly prevented a catastrophe happening and stopped any other motorist being seriously injured or even killed. ‘The officers saw Game’s car driving towards them at speeds of up to 60 mph. In a brave split second decision Pc Down decided to deliberately manoeuvre to bring Game’s car to a halt. 'As a result of the impact both vehicles were severely damaged and were written off.’ Since the crash: Game has lost her job as a carer for the elderly and suffered with depression and insomnia . Wreckage: Game was banned from driving for three years and ordered to pay court costs of £630 . Both officers and Game were taken to hospital with minor injuries after the horror crash.

"By . Ashley Collman . Charged: Maria Espinoza-Perez was charged with first-degree murder on Tuesday after police officers found her 3-year-old daughter dead at the family home on Sunday . A 3-year-old girl was discovered beaten to death at her family's Chicago home over the weekend and police believe the toddler's 24-year-old mother is to blame. Maria Espinoza-Perez wore sandals, jeans and a black t-shirt as she appeared in bond court Wednesday morning after being charged with first-degree murder. Espinoza-Perez listened through a Spanish interpreter as the judge ordered her held without bail considering the 'horrific allegations' she brutally murdered her toddler-daughter Ashley Mendoza. Ashley was in good health when her father, Espinoza-Perez's boyfriend, left work work on Sunday at 12:45pm. The little girl spent all day with her mother before Espinoza-Perez called her boyfriend at 8pm to say someone had broken into the house and their daughter wasn't breathing. Twenty minutes later, Espinoza-Perez called police to report that two men had broken into her home and injured her daughter before fleeing. When police showed up, they found the toddler dead on the kitchen floor with injuries on her forehead, bruising on her hands and legs, scrapes and abrasions on her neck, missing teeth and 'possible fractures to several bones'. No blood was found on Ashley or in the kitchen, but investigators found blood spatters in the bathroom and in the girl's bedroom  - even on her stuffed teddy bear. There were no signs of a break-in. The Cook County Medical Examiners Office reported that Ashley died from injuries sustained from child abuse and her death was ruled a homicide. After her arrest, Espinoza-Perez admitted in videotaped statements that she made up some parts of the home invation and cleaned up Ashley's blood after causing one of the injuries. She said she alone caused the girl's injuries and had been abusing her daughter for years. Scene: Espinoza-Perez called 911 on Sunday to report a break-in, but police ended up arresting the young mother when they discovered she beat her 3-year-old daughter to death .

'There was a lot of yelling, but it was mostly between the husband and wife,' Ms Padilla told the Chicago Sun-Times. Ms Padilla says the arguments were in Spanish so she never understood what the couple was fighting about, but that police never showed up before. She says the father of the toddler seemed to be a good dad. 'When he would leave every day (for work), she would stand by the window, and he would stand by the car blowing kisses and giving air hugs,' Ms Padilla said. But fellow-neighbor Steven Kispetik told WLS that the couple were peaceful. 'They're a very quiet couple. THey never interfere with anything, you know? I have no explanation,' Mr Kispetik said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has rejected another product with 'Redskin' in the name, the latest sign that it might rule against the Washington Redskins in an ongoing trademark case. The agency said Monday that 'Washington Redskin Potatoes' would be considered disparaging because the product doesn't contain redskin potatoes and therefore would be associated with the football team. The ruling then stated that current evidence reflects that 'a substantial composite of Native American Indians find the current use of ""Redskins"" in conjunction with football disparaging.' Trademark: The U.S. Patent Office has rejected another product with 'Redskin' in the name, indicating it might rule against the Washington Redskins in an ongoing trademark case . The agency issued a similar ruling in January, rejecting 'Redskins Hog Rinds.' The agency is considering whether to revoke the trademark protection for the NFL team, part of a long-running challenge from a group of Native Americans. A hearing was held 12 months ago. Team owner Dan Snyder says respect goes both ways when it comes to the debate over the team's nickname - confirming he will not be bowing to public pressure to change it anytime soon. The man who ultimately gets to decide whether the name stays or goes offered his thoughts on the matter in October in a letter to season-ticket holders, the first time he has addressed at length the change-the-name campaign that has picked up momentum this year. The tone of the letter suggests that no change is under consideration. 'I've listened carefully to the commentary and perspectives on all sides, and I respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name,' the letter states. 'But I hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means, not only for all of us in the extended Washington Redskins family, but among Native Americans too.' The letter recalls Snyder's experience when he attended his first Redskins game at age 6 and cites polls and anecdotal evidence that indicate support for the name from Native Americans. It also states that the original Boston Redskins had a Native American coach in the 1930s before the franchise relocated to Washington, even though research shows that it is unclear whether William 'Lone Star' Dietz was an actual Indian or whether he stole the identity of a missing man from the Oglala Sioux tribe. Outdated? Zena ""Chief Z"" Williams, unofficial mascot of the Washington Redskins, signs autographs during fan appreciation day at the Redskins' NFL football training camp at Redskins Park in Ashburn, Virginia in 2012 . 'The name was never a label,' Snyder's letter states. 'It was, and continues to be, a badge of honor.' While there have been groups calling for a name change for decades, a series of events this year has put the Redskins on the defensive like never before. Snyder has hired Lanny Davis, an adviser in the Clinton White House who specializes in managing political crises, as an adviser on the matter. The letter released in October shows more sensitivity than the owner's last on-the-record comment on the topic, when he told USA Today in May: 'We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.' Washington's NFL team, the 'Redskins' has also come in for concerted pressure from Native American activists and a few media outlets, along with President Barack Obama, to change its name . Leaders in Washington and some members of Congress have called for a name change, and some media outlets have stopped using the name. It is also the subject of a long-running legal challenge from a group of American Indians seeking to void the team's federal trademark protection. Indian activist Suzan Shown Harjo, a major figure in the trademark case before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, was unimpressed with Snyder's letter. She disputed several points, including the reference to Dietz, whom she said is part of the team's 'time-dishonored history of putting up pseudo-Indians as part of their promotion.' Harjo also rebuffed an assertion by Snyder that the team has an obligation to its fans to preserve its heritage. 'Part of that heritage and tradition is name-calling, belittling and maligning Native Peoples,' Harjo said in an email to The Associated Press. 'The n-word was traditional and had quite a heritage, too. Happily, not all traditions are carried on forever.' Support: A Washington Redskins fan shows his support for rebranding the US capital's beloved American football team at a symposium hosted by the Oneida Indian Nation on October 7, 2013 . Last week, President Barack Obama told The Associated Press that he would 'think about changing' the name if he owned the team. This week, the NFL said it will meet with representatives from the Oneida Indian Nation, which has been airing radio commercials pushing for a change. Commissioner Roger Goodell said Tuesday that the league needs to 'carefully listen' to critics of the name and 'make sure we're doing what's right.' Like Harjo, Oneida representative Ray Halbritter differed with the interpretation of the team's history in Snyder's letter. Oneida said the team's nickname 'was deliberately designed to denigrate people of color.' 'Unfortunately that ploy was successful,' Halbritter said in a statement. 'The marketing of this racial slur has had — and continues to have — very serious cultural, political, and public health consequences for my people and Native Americans everywhere. It is clear from Mr. Snyder's letter that he does not understand those consequences.' Team: Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, left, and Redskins general manager Bruce Allen walk together from the NFL fall meeting in Washington, on Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2013 . In the statement, Halbritter invited Snyder to take part in the tribe's upcoming meeting with the NFL. Washington coach Mike Shanahan said he was glad that that Snyder 'expressed exactly how he feels from an ownership standpoint.' Goodell has said that it is ultimately Snyder's call as to whether the name will be changed. For now, it appears the owner is not budging. 'I respect the opinions of those who disagree. I want them to know that I do hear them, and I will continue to listen and learn,' the letter states. 'But we cannot ignore our 81 year history, or the strong feelings of most of our fans as well as Native Americans throughout the country. After 81 years, the team name 'Redskins' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from, who we are, and who we want to be in the years to come.'","Patent Office says 'Washington Redskin Potatoes' would be considered disparaging because the product doesn't contain redskin potatoes .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A father-of-three is 'stranded' in a Philippines hospital - because he is unable to pay his medical bills. George 'Dougie' Keiller, 59, collapsed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the last leg of his journey to the capital Manila on February 11. He woke up six days later. Yet six weeks on, he lies anchored to a hospital bed and is unable to leave because he can not afford a medical bill which has so far reached £4,000. Dougie Keiller says he is stranded in the Philippines because he is unable to pay a £4,000 medical bill. He has been hospitalised for six weeks because of a chronic lung condition. He is pictured with fiancee Evangeline Go . Doctors at the Polymedic General Hospital, in Cagayan De Oro City, on the central coast of northern Mindanao island, have said they will not discharge him until they are paid at least half of his burgeoning invoice, he alleges. Mr Keiller said: 'After more than six weeks I'm now just desperate for this nightmare to end.' Mr Keiller, from Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, was put on a life-support machine within hours of touching down in the Philippines after his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - which causes a narrowing of the airways - struck him down. He recalled: 'I woke up in the hospital and didn't know what had happened to me. 'I didn't - and still can't - remember anything after leaving China. 'I only know I had slight difficulties with my breathing when I landed, but by the time I boarded my flight to Manila I felt absolutely fine.' Dougie Keiller has suffered from pulmonary disease COPD for 10 years. The condition causes a narrowing of the airways. When Mr Keiller arrived in the Philippines he was taken seriously ill and has been in hospital for six weeks . However, it was upon arriving in the Filipino capital to meet his fiancee Evangeline Go, 54, that he collapsed. He was rushed to the private Polymedic Hospital and put on life support. 'It was six days before I was aware of what was happening,' Mr Keiller said. He added: 'I was then treated for fever and pneumonia. 'I've had COPD for 10 years but have flown four or five times in the last five years problem-free. 'The condition landed me in hospital twice last year, so I asked doctors if I should cancel this trip but they told me there was no need for me to do that as it wasn't likely to cause any problems.' With the medical green light, the former bus driver said he attended his local Royal Bank of Scotland branch to arrange travel insurance and claims he was offered free cover as a Royalties Gold account holder. The Scottish father took out insurance through RBS. He alleges the bank will not pay his bills because his condition was 'pre-existing'. Mr Keiller alleges the bank did not ask him about any health conditions . Mr Keiller, who is on disability allowance, alleged: 'All they provided me with was a leaflet with a phone number to call. I called that number and was given a number to call if I had any problems while I was away. 'That was all I got. No terms and conditions and no questions, but was told I was covered to travel.' After six days on life support, Mr Keiller claims that he phoned the number provided but, three weeks later, he alleges that RBS declined to pay out, saying that he had failed to inform them of his pre-existing lung condition. Since then, he has remained stranded in hospital with no means to pay the £2,000 discharge fee - a bill that swells by a further £150 each day. Mr Keiller has raised £1,300 but he still remains almost £1,000 short. 'I'm now relying on donations and praying that they come soon,' said Mr Keiller. 'Until I get enough money I remain virtually a prisoner in this hospital. 'If I can be given a loan by someone I'd be so grateful and wouldn't let anyone down as far as repayment goes. 'I've been terrified here. There have been times where I've feared I'll never see outside of this hospital again. I'm now just desperate for this nightmare to end.' An RBS spokesperson confirmed that the bank is aware of Mr Keiller's situation and said that the case is being looked into. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the hospitalisation of a British National in the Philippines. We are providing consular assistance.'

"By . Cara Lee . Misdiagnosed: Pat Crowe was thought to have asthma - the condition he was actually suffering from (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) wasn't discovered for 11 years . Struggling to climb stairs without becoming breathless, Pat Crowe couldn't fathom how much his health had deteriorated since being diagnosed with asthma a decade earlier. Despite previously enjoying an active social life, playing darts and supporting local cricket and football teams, now the slightest exertion left him gasping for breath, coughing, wheezing and lethargic. 'At 39, I was astonished when my GP told me I had asthma, but apparently you can develop it as an adult,' says Pat, who lives with his wife, Lyn, in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. After his diagnosis in 1989 he was given a ventolin inhaler - or reliever - to ease his symptoms, which quickly relaxes the lung's airways that can become inflamed and narrow in an asthma patient. This can be caused by an allergic trigger such as pollen or dust, or a non-allergic one such as exercise or cold weather. This causes symptoms such as breathing difficulties, coughing, wheeziness and tightness in the chest. But Pat found that the inhalers did not help enough, and after his diagnosis he frequently experienced attacks lasting for weeks, only clearing up with antibiotics. As the years went by he needed his ventolin up to nine times a day, causing heart palpitations, a common side-effect from over-use. He was given a different type of inhaler, but still needed this constantly, as well as using a steroid inhaler - or preventer - morning and night. 'Over the next few years my need for the inhaler grew,' says grandad and father-of-two Pat, 62, a former coal miner. Being so breathless meant his confidence plummeted, making him almost housebound. 'I panicked about going outside and crossing busy roads because I was having trouble breathing and couldn't move quickly.' During bad spells he was also prescribed stronger steroid pills, which caused side-effects, including a swollen face and hunger. Widespread: The condition affects 900,000 people in the UK and is incurable, with an estimated 30,000 people dieing from it each year . 'My wife became my carer, and my family were very scared watching me struggle to breathe,' he says. 'I didn't even want to get out of bed and go down stairs because I was worried about getting back up. My life changed completely.' It was only then that Pat's consultant measured how well his lungs were functioning with a spirometer (patients blow into the machine and it assesses the volume of air inhaled and exhaled). Patients with asthma will have normal lung function, unless they are experiencing symptoms or having an attack. Pat's poor results suggested, 11 years after his asthma diagnosis, that he didn't have asthma after all, which explained why he'd found the condition impossible to control. His consultant realised he actually had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an umbrella term for a collection of conditions causing lung damage, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema (in which the tiny air sacs, or alveoli, in the lungs are damaged). The condition is incurable and affects 900,000 people in the UK, usually above the age of 35, and an estimated 30,000 people die from it each year. Experts believe there are also more than two million undiagnosed cases. The condition is linked to smoking but it can also develop after long-term asthma. 'We're now finding childhood asthma is a risk factor for COPD, probably because it strikes during an important stage of development, so by the end of their teens asthmatics often don't have as good a lung function as they should, and when lung function starts declining this can happen to them more quickly,' says Dr Ramesh Kurukulaaratchy, a consultant respiratory physician from Southampton General Hospital. But because symptoms of COPD and asthma are so similar, they are commonly confused by health professionals, he adds. After Pat was diagnosed with COPD, his medication was changed to a drug called Sprivia, which relaxes the airways for 24 hours with a single dose - working for longer than asthma medication. 'It doesn't work for everyone, but for me it's been the best thing since sliced bread,' he says. 'It's given me back my mobility and confidence, and I rarely need my inhaler.' Big improvement: Since treating his condition properly, Pat has regained his confidence and is comfortable getting around . Specialist advice is crucial when it comes to achieving an accurate diagnosis says Dr Kurukulaaratchy: 'GPs need better awareness of these conditions. They both rank highly in hospital admissions, but if management is right early on, you can improve quality of life and possibly even life expectancy.' Nick Hopkinson, honorary chest physician at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, adds: 'Asthma patients usually have normal lung function, but when they experience asthma symptoms or an attack their airways go into spasm, becoming narrow and inflamed. 'Then, after taking medication - usually a ventolin inhaler - their lungs return to normal. 'However, COPD patients have relatively fixed lung disease, so even on a good day they still have symptoms. Most of the damage isn't reversible (the airways do not widen and return to normal) and progressively worsens.' One major consequence of misdiagnosis is that patients could be given the wrong medication. COPD patients usually start with bronchodilator inhalers to relieve narrowing of the airways and then go through a hierarchy of drugs, starting with shorter-acting medications and moving to longer-acting ones, as the disease worsens, says Dr Kurukulaaratchy. 'Research has shown steroids can lead to an increased risk of pneumonia (inflammation of lung tissue) in COPD patients, so this is a risk if they are wrongly labelled as having asthma.' If the condition doesn't improve, they can end up using a lot of steroids, which have side-effects such as weight gain, mood changes and osteoporosis (weak bones.) But for asthma patients inhaled steroids are prescribed early to reduce inflammation in the airways. 'If patients are told they have COPD but it's asthma and they don't have inhaled steroids, they won't be able to control the disease - leaving them prone to worsening symptoms and even death from an asthma attack,' says Dr Hopkinson. 'We see 1,100 asthma deaths a year in the UK, often because they weren't on preventer treatments.' COPD sufferers should attend pulmonary rehabilitation courses, where they learn about the condition and receive individual exercise programmes - such as gentle walking and moving weights with their legs - which boosts their fitness and confidence, so without it they'd miss out, says Dr Hopkinson. For most asthma patients, using inhalers, not smoking and avoiding triggers means they can live a normal life, he says, so if someone's 'asthma' is uncontrollable, one reason could be because it's COPD. 'Doing allergy tests - because asthma patients often have allergies - could be beneficial, adds Dr Kurukulaaratchy, saying that advanced tests such as CT scanning can help by showing the lung damage associated with COPD, which can make diagnosis easier. 'If I'd had the right treatment and gone on a pulmonary rehabilitation course earlier I wouldn't have suffered during the years I went downhill, but I've never been angry about my misdiagnosis,' says Pat. 'I'm now involved with my CCG [clinical commissioning group], sharing my experiences to ensure people with COPD receive the right help and to prevent this happening to someone else.'For more information, contact the British Lung Foundation at blf.org.uk.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is incurable .

Teachers speak highly  of P.S. 315. 'My school is an excellent environment for learning. We are well into the 21st century and have Smart Boards, document cameras, desktops, and laptops available in all classrooms,' one teacher posted on the website Greatschools.org on Tuesday. 'This is an excellent school!' This isn't the first time a teacher has been poisoned by students. In England earlier this month, Emma Place was about to drink from her cup when she was told by another student it was laced with a toxic substance, according to The Sun. Two ten-year-old students poured a liquid containing bleach into her cup.","Male students, aged 9 and 12, have been charged with attempted assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon (rat poison)

"By . Alex Greig . A judge has ordered a seven-month-old baby's parents to change his name from Messiah to Martin after they appeared before her in a dispute about the child's surname. Instead, the pair were ordered to change the baby's first name, because, according to the judge, only one person earned the name Messiah, 'and that one person is Jesus Christ'. According to WBIR Newport, the mother of the child, Jaleesa Martin, and his father couldn't agree on whose last name the boy should have, so they went before child support magistrate Lu Ann Ballew at Cocke County Chancery Court on Thursday to decide the matter. Name changer: A judge in eastern Tennessee ordered for the baby boy's first name to Martin from Messiah . Naming rights: Mother Jaleesa Martin is refusing to change her child's name . However, Ballew took issue not with the baby's surname but his first: Messiah. The baby's full name was officially Messiah DeShawn Martin, but Ballew told the baby's parents that they must change it to Martin DeShawn McCullough, which incorporates both mother and father's surnames but leaves out Messiah. ""The word Messiah is a title and it's a title that has only been earned by one person and that one person is Jesus Christ,"" Judge Ballew told WBIR. Christian: Magistrate Ballew has strong feelings about children being named after Jesus - but not with the name Jesus . A WBIR reporter asked the judge what she thought about all the children named Jesus. 'Well, I thought about that,' she responded. 'That's not relevant to this case.' Martin is amazed a judge could force her to change her son's name because of their own religion. 'I was shocked. I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because of her religious beliefs.' Name day: Mom Jaleesa Martin is fighting the order to change her baby's name back to Massiah . Judge Ballew said she was thinking of the child's future wellbeing when she made the decision. The area of Newport where Martin and her son live has a large proportion of Christians, said the judge. 'It could put him at odds with a lot of people and at this point he has had no choice in what his name is,' Judge Ballew said. Happy baby: Little Messiah has no idea about the controversy surrounding his name . Martin, who has two older children named Micah and Mason, intends to fight Ballew's decision. 'Everybody believes what they want so I think I should be able to name my child what I want to name him, not someone else,' she said. An appeal will go before the Cocke County Chancellor on September 13.","Magistrate Lu Ann Ballew ordered a baby's name changed from Messiah to Martin .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Carole Graham chose to have a preventative operation after discovering she carried the killer BRCA2 gene - only to be told she already had cancer . She lost her mother to cancer, and watched her sister fight the disease. The heartache prompted Carole Graham to take action, determined to face the killer head on and do all she could to stop it in its path. Doctors advised the 58-year-old to have a preventative hysterectomy after tests revealed she carried a killer cancer gene, predisposing her to the disease. But when surgeons carried out the operation they discovered Ms Graham already had ovarian cancer - which would otherwise could have gone unnoticed until it was too late. Ms Graham, from Pity Me in Durham, said: 'I was totally in shock, it was not what I had expected. 'I thought I was doing this to prevent the cancer but I already had it. 'I was showing no symptoms so it would have gone unnoticed until it was too late. 'If my mum hadn’t died of cancer we would never have tested our genes when my sister Jan was diagnosed. It’s thanks to my Mum that I’m still here.' Ms Graham, a radiographic assistant, found that she possessed a killer cancer gene after her sister Jan was diagnosed with cancer, which is linked to breast cancer. Seven of Ms Graham’s sisters decided to get tested for the . life-threatening gene BRCA2, as their mother and grandmother had died of . breast cancer. Ms Graham was one of the four sisters to receive the life-changing news. The NHS worker said: 'I was devastated. The gene makes you 90 per cent likely to get cancer. 'So when the doctor told me I carried it, I asked straight away for a hysterectomy.' As soon as she discovered she had the gene, Ms Graham immediately requested a preventative hysterectomy. Ms Graham (left) underwent her preventative hysterectomy at the same time as her sister Pauline (right). After losing their mother to cancer, Ms Graham and her six sisters were tested for the gene - four were found to be carriers . A woman's risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a harmful mutation of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Men who inherit the genes also have an increased risk of breast cancer, and both men and woman with the genes may face a greater risk of developing other cancers. Genetic tests can check for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, in people with a family history of cancer that suggests the presence of the genes. If the harmful mutations are found, patients face several options to help manage their risk of cancer, including preventative surgery. Last May Hollywood star Angelina Jolie revealed she had undergone a preventative double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing the disease. Her mother Macheline Betrand died of cancer in 2007. Jolie, a mother of six and partner of Brad Pitt, said she took the decision to have the procedure because she found she carries BRCA1, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Source: National Cancer Institute . On January 8, 2013, she went in to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary for her hysterectomy with her sister Pauline, who also carried the gene. She said: 'We walked hand in hand into that hospital and our beds lay next to each other. 'Before our operations I was crying and she climbed straight into my bed where we cried together. 'Having her there got me through.' Her sister Pauline added: 'It’s a massive thing having a hysterectomy so we wanted to go in together. 'We needed to grab this by the bones and say ""I will not be a victim"".' But for Ms Graham, the operation was not the preventative surgery she had expected. She said: 'During the operation, they found a cyst on my ovaries. 'They sent it off to be tested and it came back positive. 'I already had cancer of the ovaries and the dreaded gene had caused it. 'Not in my wildest dreams could that have happened. I was devastated.' Ms Graham had shown no signs of the cancer and her symptoms would have carried on unnoticed. Without being tested and going for the operation Ms Graham's (pictured with her son Stuart, who was found to carry the gene, and her two grandsons) tumour could have gone unnoticed, lying undiscovered until it was too late . She said: 'I was told that in a couple of years time if my symptoms began to show, it would have been too late. 'I am just so thankful me and my sisters had that chance to get tested. 'My mum didn’t, but it’s thanks to her we’ve been saved.' Ms Graham started a course of chemotherapy to kill off the disease and the results were exactly what she was hoping for. 'If my mum hadn’t died of cancer we would never have tested our genes' - Carole Graham . She said: 'My bloods showed that I was in remission. It was a fantastic day.' Ms Graham returned to work cancer-free but still had another preventative operation to endure. 'The only way to prevent getting breast cancer with this gene is to have a bilateral mastectomy,' she said. 'I had already diced with death once, I didn’t want to do it again. 'So on March 14, I went in once more for the mastectomy. 'All six of my sisters were by my side as I went through what I hope will be my last surgery. 'God may have taken my mum, but he left me with six wonderful sisters. Ms Graham, 58, said: 'If my mum hadn't died of cancer we would never have tested our genes when my sister Jan was diagnosed. It's thanks to my Mum (pictured on her wedding day) that I'm still here' 'I always have six strong, powerful women behind me. Whether one of us has the gene or not we are all in it together.' Ms Graham is now recovering from her double mastectomy at home with peace of mind. She said: 'All of the breast tissue they removed came back clear. I was so glad. 'I can put that gene to bed now because I’ve removed all the bits it can get.' Ms Graham’s two daughters have thankfully not been passed on the gene - but her son Stuart, 38, was one of the unlucky ones. She said: 'I am not going to let it worry me because I know he will be protected and screened. 'It took my mum and I’m not letting it take any more of us.'","Carole Graham was tested for the gene after her mother died of cancer .

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Damien Gayle . Nigerian rescue workers today dug into the rubble of the market destroyed in a car bomb attack attack which has killed at least 118 people. Most victims of the attack in Jos, central Nigeria, are women and children who worked at the market, said Mohammed Abdulsalam of the National Emergency Management Agency. 'We expect to find more bodies in the rubble,' he said. The search for survivors was called off last night after fires lit by the explosions became too fierce. Warning graphic content . Rescuers carry a body recovered from a burned-out shop at the scene of twin bomb blasts at terminus market in the central Nigerian city of Jos which killed 118 people yesterday .

A damaged road in a deserted street, the aftermath at the scene of the twin bomb attack in a market in Jos . Earthmovers were this afternoon demolishing buildings weakened by the blasts and resultant fires and moved heavy debris, allowing rescuers to search for more of the dead. 'Allahu akhbar!' some young Muslim men yelled provocatively at an AP photographer near the scene, as suspicions grew that Islamist militant group Boko Haram carried out the attack. Gloria Paul was among a handful of people searching for loved ones at Bingham University Teaching Hospital. She was looking for her husband but all she had found was his car parked near Terminus Market, its windows all shattered. Next to the bomb site, dozens of wailing people crowded outside the morgue at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, waiting their turn to see if relatives and loved-ones were among the dead. The wreckage of a the car which contained one of the bombs lies at the scene of the attack . State police officials inspect the wreckage of burnt vehicles. At least 118 bodies were delivered to hospital morgues Tuesday, and 64 people were being treated in hospital . Security forces cordoned off the area of mounds of rubble, burned-out vehicles and smashed buildings with the debris of panic scattered around - a sandal here, a hat there. Exploded mangoes and pineapples rotted in the sun, their sickly sweet smell mixing with the stench of rotting human flesh. A charred engine block was all that remained of the grain-filled truck that held the second bomb. Police anti-bomb squad officers investigated a crater left by one of the blasts. The second blast came half an hour after . the first, designed to kill rescue workers who had rushed to the . scene.

A woman wails in agony, her skin raw from the injuries she suffered in the attack blamed on Boko Haram . The search for survivors was halted last night by fires ignited in buildings by the blasts, the echoes of which were heard miles away. Firefighters battled through the night to douse the flames that consumed buildings, Mr Abdulsalam told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. At least 118 bodies were delivered to hospital morgues yesterday, and 64 people were being treated in hospital, he said. President Goodluck Jonathan indicated that he blames Boko Haram for Tuesday's attack, assuring Nigerians their government 'remains fully committed to winning the war against terror.' Two car bombs exploded in the mostly Christian city of Jos, Nigeria, killing at least 118. The attack bears all the hallmarks of extremist Muslim group Boko Haram . Second blast was timed to go off half an hour after the first in order to kill rescue workers helping the wounded . Just last month Boko Haram killed 120 and injured at least 200 in the Nigerian capital of Abuja . While nobody has claimed responsibility . for the attacks, the double blast bears all the hallmarks of tactics . used by militant Islamic group Boko Haram. A market official said he helped remove 50 casualties, most of them dead. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to give information to reporters. 'It's horrifying, terrible,' said Mark . Lipdo of the Stefanos Foundation, a Christian charity based in Jos, who . said he could smell burning flesh. Lipdo said at least one of the bombs could have been averted if authorities had acted in time. He said a white van that held the . first bomb was parked for hours in the market place, raising suspicions . of vendors and others who reported it to the authorities, but nothing . was done. Boko Haram's terrorist insurgency has killed more than 2,000 people this year alone after the government vowed to crack down on the Islamic group . Boko Haram, whose name means Western education is sinful, want to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria controlled by Sharia Law . Witnesses at the scene report bodies and body parts laying in the road covered with grain which was packed around one of the bombs when it went off . He said authorities also had another . warning of impending violence: a man with explosives strapped to his . body was arrested on Saturday and told police that many militants had . been ordered to plant bombs around churches and public areas in Jos. Dozens of bodies and body parts were covered in grain that had been loaded in the second car bomb, witnesses said. Photographs showed a woman's body, legs blown off, on the edge of an inferno consuming other bodies, with a hand reaching out of the flames. Another woman, unconscious, was being carried away in a wheelbarrow on a road strewn with glass shards. The second bomb was detonated half an hour after the first, and was designed to kill rescue workers who came to help the wounded . Tensions have been rising between Christians and Muslims in the city, in Nigeria's Middle Belt region that divides the country into the predominantly Muslim north and Christian south. Boko Haram has claimed other recent bomb attacks, including two separate bomb blasts in April that killed more than 120 people and wounded more than 200 in Abuja, the nation's capital. A suicide car bomber killed 25 people in northern Kano city on Monday. Police there detonated a second car bomb Monday. They said both would have killed many people but the first exploded before it reached its target of restaurants and bars in the Christian quarter of the Muslim city. Yesterday President Goodluck Jonathan extended sympathies to affected families and promised a bigger force to fight the Islamists. In a statement, the Nigerian government 'assures all Nigerians that government remains fully committed to winning the war against terror, and this administration will not be cowed by the atrocities of enemies of human progress and civilization.' The government and military's failure to curtail the five-year-old Islamic uprising, highlighted by the continuing mass abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls has caused national and international outrage. Jonathan has been forced to accept help from several nations including Britain and the United States in the hunt for the girls, who were taken in northeast Nigeria, with threats to sell them into sexual slavery. According to charity worker Mark Lipdo, stall owners in the market had reported a suspicious white van to police hours before the bombs went off, but nothing was done . Around 2,000 people have been killed in Nigeria this year alone. In April two more bomb blasts in the capital of Abuja killed more than 120 people and injured an estimated 200 . The mostly Christian city of Jos is in Nigeria's Middle Belt, which divides the Christian north from the Muslim south . It also has brought attention to the shadowy extremist group, which is demanding the release of detained insurgents in exchange for the girls - a swap officials say the government will not consider. Diplomats said Nigeria on Tuesday asked a U.N. Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against al-Qaida to add Boko Haram to the list, with an arms embargo and asset freeze. Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is sinful' wants to turn Nigeria into an Islamic state under Shariah law. Half of Nigeria's population of 170million is Christian, as is most of the population of Jos. Despite a year-old state of emergency being declared in three of Nigeria's provinces, the militants attacks have become more lethal and more widespread in 2014. On Christmas Eve in 2010, bombs allegedly planted by Boko Haram exploded in Jos, killing as many as 80 people, meanwhile more than 300 people have been killed in assaults on towns and villages in recent weeks. The group recently captured 300 schoolgirls and is threatening to sell them into the sex trade if prisoners are not released (pictured, Martha Mark with picture of her missing daughter, Monica) Extremists have also been blamed for an attack on a Chinese camp in neighbouring Cameroon last week in which one Cameroonian soldier was killed and 10 Chinese workers abducted. The Senate on Tuesday voted to extend the emergency for another six months but only if Jonathan agrees to spend more money arming soldiers, who say Boko Haram is better equipped. More than 2,000 people have been killed in the insurgency this year in Africa's most populous nation, compared to an estimated 3,600 between 2010 and 2013.","Two blasts tore through market in central Nigerian city of Jos yesterday .

Cat's amazing: The famous feline was the star attraction on Tuesday at the Bakersfield Blaze home game . Tara, however, didn’t quite play ball. Organisers had provided a baseball attached to a piece of string for the ceremonial first pitch, but . she wasn’t very interested in swatting it. In the end Mr Triantafilo gave her a helping hand and moved her paw through the air as he pitched the baseball. The crowd were ecstatic nonetheless. Last Wednesday, she became the nation's most beloved cat when surveillance . footage emerged showing her saving Jeremy by pouncing on the . neighbor's dog as it attacked him. Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born. She followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said. Last Thursday, Jeremy snoozed his way through his first live interview on the Today show as his parents described their shock at Tara's act of bravery. 'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat . take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo said. 'That dog did not . even know what hit him.' Erica explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the neighbor's dog, an eight-month-old male Labrador-Chow mix, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg. 'I'd never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.' Loved: The cat happily lets the little boy kiss her as he calls her a hero who saved him from a 'mean dog' After the attack, Tara can be seen chasing the dog away before returning to Jeremy's side. In an interview with the Bakersfield Californian, . his family said she had always been protective over their oldest child . and slept in his crib when he was a baby. They also have younger twin . boys. They added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, even though Erica is allergic to cats. She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said. They named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means driftwood. 'We named her driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.' She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it. Lurking: Jeremy Triantafilo was outside his family's home when a neighbor's dog escaped and ran towards him . To the rescue! Tara the cat can be seen running towards her beloved owner as the dog shakes him . 'She's the most mellow cat you've ever seen,' she told Today. 'All our boys love her... and she loves them right back.' The video had shown . Jeremy sitting on his bicycle outside his family's home on Tuesday when . the dog escaped its home through an open gate and crept up on him from . behind. Surveillance footage, which Jeremy's father uploaded to YouTube, shows the dog grabbing the boy's leg and pulling him to the ground before violently shaking him with his teeth clamped tight. Then suddenly, an unlikely hero bounds towards him - the family's cat, Tara. The . video shows the fearless feline jumping on the dog with enough force to . push him away from the boy. Tara then chases the dog away from the . driveway with its leg between its tail. Feline brave: The cat launches herself at the startled dog and knocks it away from Jeremy . And don't come back! Tara follows the dog to make sure it has left, before returning to check on Jeremy . The neighbor, who had been pulling out of their gated driveway when the dog escaped, called 911 for the boy and his mother, KERO reported. The boy, who has mild autism, needed 1- stitches to the deep wounds on his legs but is otherwise fine. 'He's just bouncing back from this,' she told Today. 'He . tells us it feels better.' Speaking to Kero, he said: 'Tara is my hero!' The dog was taken by Bakersfield Animal Control and could be rehabilitated at the neighbors' but home but also faces being euthanized.

Sydney photographer Joe Wigdahl took the image of Kirrilee Edwards, in November 2012, the same month Kirrilee died. Aged 12, she suffered a seizure which left her with irreversible brain damage and she required 24 hour care by her mother, Jo and father, Troy. Winning portrait: The heartbreaking photo of a frail Kirrilee Edwards, being touched by her family, won Sydney photographer Joe Wigdahl first prize in the 2014 Head On Portrait competition. The image, titled Family Loss, won Wigdahl cash and camera equipment for its heartbreaking depiction of a family's love for their daughter, which included six siblings Tarsha, Shavonne, Brooklyn, Mackenzie and twins Connor and Bailey. The photographer told the MailOnline he was going to donate half his prize winnings to the Edwards family, who forked out a fortune on the care and support for their daughter. 'I wanted to capture this sense of family, this warm, loving, humorous family that connect with one and other through touch,' he told the ABC. The winning photo was typical of the love Kirrilee received from her parents and six siblings. In 2012, the Daily Telegraph reported on the the Edwards family’s plight. 'They are the human face of a mystery illness that robbed their daughter of a normal life — and changed their own lives forever,' the story said. The family lived in Springwood in the Blue Mountains.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Significant concern has been caused by a series of threats from al Qaeda-linked groups to attack America and Europe, it has been reported. Officials are thought to be studying the threats, which have evolved over the past six months and are determining the strength of al Qaeda in several different countries including Yemen, Pakistan and Syria, although none have been corroborated. U.S. officials had believed that the terrorist organisation was focusing on planning attacks outside of the United States due to the difficulty in breaching homeland security. Members of Ansar al-Sharia, an al Qaeda-affiliated group, are seen near a tank in the southern Yemeni town of Jaar last month. It is thought groups in the country could be planning attacks in the United States and Europe . Yemeni soldiers launch a major offensive against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula earlier this month . However CNN has reported that the new threats suggest there could be plans to target sites within America and Europe. They reported that a senior U.S. official said that 'we do not see operational cells of al Qaeda inside the United States' but emphasised this could not be ruled out. It is thought that the source of the threats comes from three separate regions including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula based in Yemen. The U.S. considers Yemen's local al Qaeda branch as the terror group's most dangerous offshoot worldwide. It is blamed for a number of unsuccessful . bomb plots aimed at Americans, including an attempt to bring down a . U.S.-bound airliner with explosives hidden in the bomber's underwear and . a second plot to send mail bombs hidden in the toner cartridges on . planes headed to the U.S. Pakistani army soldiers patrolling the tribal areas of North Waziristan, where they are fighting al-Qaeda activists. Pakistan is one country where al Qaeda threats are thought to be coming from . The U.S. embassy in Sanaa shut down its premises this month as a precaution against possible retaliatory attacks and is set to remain closed for several more days. A core group from the organisation is also thought to be operating in Pakistan and another official has told CNN that they could be looking to place operatives to attack U.S. targets both in America and abroad. Meanwhile there is also worry that a third terrorist threat comes from Syria where it is believed more than 70 Americans have travelled to fight in the conflict there. The Treasury Department has already levied sanctions on two individuals suspected of supporting al-Qaeda in Syria. The two individuals are known informally as al-Juhni and al-Qaduli. They are suspected of handling a range of duties, including arranging payments, passing messages, providing intelligence and arranging meetings for al Qaeda.","Reports say threats from the group have evolved in recent months .

"By . Claire Ellicott . A woman teaching assistant who was branded a 'sexual predator' is facing jail after admitting to liaisons with boy pupils after an end-of-year prom. Emma Webb, 41, a married mother-of-two, was accused of abusing her position of trust with three boys at the secondary school where she worked, which cannot be named for legal reasons. She wept in the dock as she admitted 16 charges of causing boys aged between 15 and 17 years to engage in sexual activities. Pleaded guilty: School supply teacher Emma Webb, 41, admitted giving sexual favours to three teenage boys from the school she worked at near Wokingham, Berkshire (pictured) At her first appearance in June in . front of Reading magistrates, prosecutor Helen Gambrill described Webb . as a 'sexual predator'. Webb was accused of sleeping with one . pupil on as many as 12 occasions and performing sex acts on him and . another boy, as well as kissing and groping a third. She also sent one of the boys graphic images she had taken while performing sex acts on herself, the court heard.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and James  Nye . More than a half million computers in over 100 countries were infected by sophisticated malware that lets cybercriminals take over a computer and hijack its webcam, authorities said as charges were announced Monday against four US citizens and more than 100 people worldwide. The FBI described its investigation in criminal complaints unsealed in Manhattan federal court against five individuals. Meanwhile, police worldwide said they had recently arrested 97 people in 16 countries suspected of using or distributing the malicious software called BlackShades. Scroll down for video . Charges: Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, discusses arrests in the malware BlackShades case, during a news conference in New York, on Monday, May 19, 2014 . At a news conference today in Manhattan, FBI agents and the US attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara said authorities had arrested one of Blackshades co-creators, Alex Yucel, in Moldova. He is currently awaiting extradition to the United States. Also arrested was Brendan Johnston of Thouands Oaks, California, who allegedly sold Blackshades RAT programming - which allowed them to hack webcams - and provided technical support to others between August 2011 and September 2012. Others charged with conspiracy to commit computer hacking include Kyle Fedorek of New York, Marlen Rappa, a Blackshades member in New Jersey and Michael Hogue of Tucson, Arizona, who also created the malware. Global situation: More than a half million computers in over 100 countries were infected by sophisticated malware that lets cybercriminals take over a computer and hijack its webcam, authorities said . Yucel, 24, is a Swedish citizen and faces charges that carry sentences of up to 15-years in prison according to the LA Times. Johnston, 23, is looking at a prison term of 10 years for his two counts of computer hacking. Fedorek, 26, and Rappa, 41, are also staring at a decade each in prison for the charges against them. Hogue, 23, has pleaded not guilty to computer hacking and cooperated with prosecutors in a plea deal - his sentence is yet to be announced. Bharara described the technology as 'inexpensive and simple to use,' but called its invasiveness 'breathtaking.' 'As today's case makes clear, we now live in a world where, for just $40, a cybercriminal halfway across the globe can – with just a click of a mouse – unleash a RAT that can spread a computer plague not only on someone's property, but also on their privacy and most personal spaces,' said Bharara. 'You can't just hide in another country anymore,' Bharara said. 'We will get as many people as we can.' Extortion: Leo Taddeo, special agent-in-charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation,Special Operations and Cyber Division, discusses the arrests in the malware BlackShades crackdown today in Manhattan . The FBI said the BlackShades Remote Access Tool has been sold since at least 2010 to several thousand users. 'This case is a strong reminder that no one is safe while using the Internet,' said Koen Hermans, an official representing the Netherlands in the European Union's criminal investigation coordination unit, Eurojust. 'It should serve as a warning and deterrent to those involved in the manufacture and use of this software.' The agency said one of the program's co-creators is now cooperating with the government and had provided extensive information. The malware lets hackers steal personal information, intercept keystrokes and hijack webcams to make secret recordings of users. BlackShades also can be used to encrypt and lock a computer's data files, blocking the rightful owners from regaining access unless they pay a ransom. Security experts have linked the program to attacks on Syrian dissidents in 2012 and attempts to steal data from more than a dozen French organizations last year. The low cost of the hacking tool has made it increasingly popular across the hacker underground, where variants have been circulating online for years. External help: Exterior view of the Europol headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands, Monday, on May 19, 2014. European law enforcement agencies say they have helped coordinate raids in 16 countries that led to 97 arrests of people suspected of developing, distributing or using criminal software known as BlackShades . Last year, security firm Symantec said that use of BlackShades was going up, with licenses for the program going for $40 to $100. French officials said raids occurred last week after the FBI arrested two BlackShades developers and distributed a list of customers who had purchased the malware. Law enforcement coordination agencies Europol and Eurojust, based in The Hague, Netherlands, said Monday that police in 13 European countries — Austria, Belgium, Britain, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Moldova, the Netherlands and Switzerland — as well as in the United States, Canada and Chile raided 359 properties and seized cash, firearms, drugs and more than 1,000 data storage devices. The two European agencies declined to provide country-by-country breakdowns of arrests, details of items seized or the specific days when last week's raids occurred. In Paris, the state prosecutor's office said French detectives arrested more than two dozen people during May 13 raids and described the global nature of the arrests and searches as an unprecedented 'new form of judicial action.' It said those arrested were identified by the FBI as French 'citizens who had acquired or used this software.' In a BlackShades-related investigation before the latest global arrests, Dutch police earlier this year arrested an 18-year-old man for using the malware to take pictures of women and girls using about 2,000 computers.","Federal prosecutors announced charges on Monday against alleged computer hackers linked to an international group called Blackshades .

But it was not until Wednesday that a correction was issued and Mr Harvey was removed, reported NT News. Neil Roy Harvey was falsely identified by police as being one the Northern Territory's eight most wanted criminals and is threatening to take legal action over the mistake . It had been stated by police that Mr Harvey was wanted for not appearing in court in March for the alleged assault of a female. But Mr Harvey had actually been arrested last Saturday, three days before his name appeared on the list on a police website. He is due to face court today and said a senior officer went to his house on Tuesday afternoon the apologise for the gaffe.

"By . Sarah Dean . and Freya Noble . Classmates who studied with Tony Abbott's daughter have hit back at revelations that Frances received a scholarship for a university degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister. Ms Abbott, 22, accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors. The news came on Wednesday, the same day that thousands of students protested across Australia about the cuts to tertiary education funding, announced in Mr Abbott's federal budget. Talented: Fashion enthusiast Frances Abbott, seen here in Melbourne in April, received a scholarship for her degree at the Whitehouse Institute of Design in Sydney's Surry Hills . Chad Mason, 20, who studied alongside Frances in 2011 for a Bachelor of Design in styling and creative direction, told news.com.au he was absolutely outraged. 'I can assure you that there were no scholarships awarded to any other students in our cohort, and I can definitely say that I studied with some extremely talented people who were more deserving of a $60,000 scholarship,' he said. Other students who did not wish to be named said there were students that did it really tough just to get through the degree and pay the expensive fees. One woman, who reportedly comes from a low-income background and finished the course with a high-distinction average, said she was upset that someone as privileged as the Prime Minister's daughter was given assistance and that there were other more deserving students. The Whitehouse Institute's website states that it 'does not currently offer scholarships to gain a place into the Bachelor of Design,' though it does say students may be sponsored to undertake further study once already at the college. The chief executive of Whitehouse Ian Tudor however said the college does award 'all sorts of scholarships; it would probably be 20 or more each year'. Mr Tudor also said that as the institution was a private company, the founder and owner Leanne Whitehouse was well within her jurisdiction to offer Frances the scholarship. The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said. Revelation: Tony Abbott's daughter received a scholarship for a univeristy degree costing more than $60,000 from a long-time friend of the Prime Minister . Mr Abbott defended his daughter Fairfax radio on Thursday, and said his daughter got it on her academic potential. 'She kept it on her academic merit - she is a distinction student,' he said. The college was so pleased with Frances' performance it offered her a place in their initial Masters course, he said, though Mr Abbott did not believe the matter warranted media interest. A spokeswoman for the prime minister said if Mr Abbott received alternative advice on declaring the scholarship he would 'meet the amended requirements.' Mr Abbott has not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events. Prestigious: Frances graduated with distinction-level in 2013 from the Whitehouse Institute and is currently working for them as a teacher's aide in Melbourne . Current laws rule that members of the House of Representatives are required to declare gifts of more than $300 when they are given to themselves, their spouses and dependent children and come from non-official sources. However, a spokeswoman has denied that Mr Abbott needed to disclose his daughter's scholarship as it did not constitute a gift. 'Under the statement of Registrable Interests, a scholarship is not a gift it is an award based on merit and disclosure is not required,' she said in a statement. 'If alternative advice is provided, Mr Abbott will meet the amended requirements.' Guidelines currently say gifts from family members or personal friends 'need not be registered unless the member judges that an appearance of conflict of interest may be seen to exist'. Mr Abbott has known the Institute's chairman Mr Taylor for many years, the Prime Minister's office said. When Mr Abbott was in opposition he received clothing from him as a gift in February 2012 and April 2013. Family: Tony Abbott, seen here in Sydney with his wife Margie Abbott, and daughters Louise, Bridget and Frances in 2013, has denied any wrong doing . 'While the exact cost of the gifts were not known, it was clear they were higher than the $300 threshold and were appropriately disclosed, with Mr Abbott providing all the information required by an opposition member,' Mr Abbott's spokeswoman said. Frances graduated with distinction-level in 2013 and is currently working for Whitehouse as a teacher's aide in Melbourne. She aims to continue her studies with a Masters degree course later this year and is now a regular front-row fixture at Australian fashion shows. Details of Frances' scholarship emerged as students campaigned against the Abbott government's changes to tertiary education in cities around the country. The institute that Frances attended is likely to benefit from the federal government's changes to subsidies, which previously did not cover private colleges. Mr Abbott attended last year's graduation ceremony at the institute in support of his daughter and gave a speech praising its work.","Frances Abbott accepted a $60,000 'chairman's scholarship' for her course at the Whitehouse Institute of Design .

The female boxer, called Rio, was discovered just 'days from death' and on the brink of starvation at an address in Birkenhead, Merseyside. The dog was so desperately thin that she had developed sores on her shoulders and pelvis where the bones had rubbed painfully as she had tried to lie down on the ground to sleep.

Owner Kelly Gilfoyle has now been banned from keeping animals after the dog was discovered by the RSPCA in a severe state of dehydration and was found eating a raw onion - which can be poisonous to dogs. Inspectors revealed the property, on Clifford Street, was covered in rubbish and faeces and there was no food or water to be found. Rio was just skin and bone and was rushed to a vet who gave her a body score of just one - one being emaciated and five being obese. Gilfoyle, 32, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the dog by failing to investigate and address the causes of her poor body condition and weight loss. Owner Kelly Gilfoyle has now been banned from keeping animals after the dog was discovered by the RSPCA in a severe state of dehydration and was found eating a raw onion - which can be poisonous to dogs . RSPCA Inspector Anthony Joynes said: 'Rio was on the brink of starvation and a vet who examined her said she would have died within a few days from organ failure due to the starvation and dehydration' Appearing at Wirral Magistrates Court, Gilfoyle was banned from owning any animals for 10 years and given a 14 week prison sentence, suspended for two years. She was also ordered to carry out 140 hours community service, a 12 month supervision order and told to pay costs of £1,740. Speaking after the sentencing, RSPCA Inspector Anthony Joynes said: 'Rio was on the brink of starvation and a vet who examined her said she would have died within a few days from organ failure due to the starvation and dehydration. 'Since she has been in our care she has made an amazing recovery - and this is a result of us simply feeding her and giving her water. The officer added: 'Since she has been in our care she has made an amazing recovery - and this is a result of us simply feeding her and giving her water' 'The worst thing for me was the fact that poor Rio had pressure sores on her shoulders and pelvic bones because she was so thin her bones were painfully rubbing on the ground when she laid down. 'As a result she now has scars from this awful neglect. 'Sadly cases like these do appear to be becoming more common. 'But I hope this sentence sends out a clear message that it is unacceptable to leave an animal like this and the courts will take these offences seriously.'","Female boxer, called Rio, discovered just 'days from death' in Birkenhead .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Ap . A new map has been revealed showing where every execution in U.S. history has taken place as a Missouri murder was given a last minute reprieve from a lethal injection. The graphic shows all executions that have taken place in every state since they joined the union, with 13, 946 having been carried out since 1776. The map, compiled by Time, comes as the U.S. Supreme Court halted the execution of Russell Bucklew, an inmate with a rare medical condition, who challenged the state of Missouri's refusal to disclose the source of its lethal injection drug. Execution map . Bucklew had been scheduled to be put to death at 12.01 a.m. on Wednesday for the 1996 killing of a man during a violent crime spree in Missouri. It was scheduled to be the first execution by lethal injection since the botched execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma last month. Lockett's vein collapsed, and he writhed on the gurney before dying of a heart attack more than 40 minutes after the start of a procedure that typically takes roughly one-fourth of that time to complete. The new map shows that Texas has carried out the most executions of all the states, with 1,230 since it joined the United States in 1845. In comparison, both Michigan and Alaska have never took part in any executions. The execution of Bucklew will now be considered again by the court after being blocked by Justice Samuel Alito. Spared: An appeals court stayed the execution of Russell Bucklew, pictured, saying that the state of Missouri has failed to prove that the convicted killer would not be subjected to pain and suffering  caused by his rare medical condition during lethal injection . By law, Missouri has a 24-hour window to carry out a scheduled execution, and the ruling from the full Supreme Court on Wednesday evening meant the state Supreme Court would have to set a new execution date if Missouri is to carry out the punishment. Minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, people who were to have witnessed Bucklew's execution on the state's behalf were released. Eric Slusher, a spokesman for Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, confirmed that no further litigation was expected on Wednesday. 'This is something the attorney general's office is going to have to respond to and take up in court. As a result, we will stand down tonight,' Missouri Department of Corrections spokesman Mike O'Connell told reporters. Bucklew, 46, suffers from a rare congenital condition — cavernous hemangioma — that causes weakened and malformed blood vessels, as well as tumors in his nose and throat. His attorneys say this and the secrecy surrounding the state's lethal injection drug combine to make for an unacceptably high chance of something going wrong during his execution. He told The Associated Press last week that he was scared of what might happen during the process. Victim: Michael Sanders, pictured, was shot and killed by Bucklew in front of his two sons. Stephanie Pruitt and her two daughters, who had been staying with Sanders, also witnessed the killing . The Supreme Court sent the case back to the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 'Today's stay of execution will give the lower federal courts time to consider Mr. Bucklew's claim that his execution would violate his rights under the Eighth Amendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment,' Lindsay Runnels, an attorney for Bucklew said in an email to the AP. The next scheduled executions in the U.S. are on June 18 — in Missouri, Florida and Pennsylvania, though the Pennsylvania execution likely will be delayed. Missouri switched from a three-drug protocol to the single drug pentobarbital late last year. None of the six inmates executed since Missouri made the change has shown outward signs of pain or suffering. European companies opposed to capital punishment cut off supplies of certain execution drugs, leading states to turn to U.S. sources. The states refuse to identify the sources of their execution drugs, saying secrecy is necessary to protect the sources from possible retaliation by death penalty opponents. Lethal injection: Former Cape Girardeau county prosecutor Morley Swingle has called Bucklew a 'homicidal Energiser bunny' Death penalty opponents say the secrecy makes it impossible to ensure the drugs couldn't cause an inmate to endure an agonizing death that rises to the level of unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. The AP and four other news organizations filed a lawsuit last week against the Missouri Department of Corrections, claiming the state's refusal to provide information on the execution drug violates the public's constitutional right to have access to information about the punishment. Bucklew was sentenced to death for the murder of Michael Sanders in March 21, 1996. Botched execution: Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett, pictured, took 43 minutes to die after a lethal injection went awry in April . According to prosecutors, Bucklew was angry at his girlfriend, Stephanie Pruitt, for leaving him. Pruitt moved with her two daughters into the Cape Girardeau home of Mr Sanders, who had two sons. He then tracked Ms Pruitt down at Mr Sanders' home and killed him in front of the four children. He handcuffed and beat his former girlfriend, drove her to a secluded area and raped her. Later, after a state trooper spotted the car, Bucklew shot at the trooper but missed, authorities say. Bucklew later escaped from jail, hid in the home of Pruitt's mother and beat her with a hammer. Bucklew, whose steak dinner in a holding cell Tuesday night was his chosen 'last meal', declined offers of breakfast and lunch on Wednesday as the Supreme Court weighed his fate, O'Connell said. He was to remain in that holding cell that night before being sent to a prison in nearby Potosi.

"By . Associated Press . and Jonathan Block . FDA investigators haven't been able to figure out why pets are getting ill from the treats since the agency began receiving reports of illnesses in 2007. 'We know some pet parents are wary of dog and cat treats made in China, especially Chicken Jerky products, and we’ve heard their concerns,' said Petco CEO Jim Myers said in a statement. 'As a leader in the industry and the trusted partner for our pet parents, we’re eager to make this transition and to expand our assortment of safe and healthy treats, the majority of which are made right here in the U.S. Very simply, we feel this decision is in the best interest of the pets we all love and, ultimately, for our business.'

The company announced Tuesday it would stop selling dog treats from China after the FDA received reports of more than 1,000 dog deaths related to jerky made there . In an update last week, the FDA said it has received more than 4,800 complaints of pet illnesses and more than 1,000 reports of dog deaths after eating Chinese-made chicken, duck or sweet potato jerky treats. The FDA said tests found antiviral drug amantadine in some samples of imported chicken jerky treats sold a year or more ago, but doesn't think it caused the illnesses. The FDA said it will continue to investigate. 'We’ve been following the FDA warnings and related customer concerns closely, and we’ve been actively reducing our China-made assortment and expanding our American-made offerings for several years now,' Myers said. A Chicago Petco store. Now that the company has announced it will stop selling pet treats made in China, only treats from the U.S., New Zealand, Australia and South America will be sold . 'We know the FDA hasn’t yet identified a direct cause for the reported illnesses, but we decided the uncertainty of the situation outweighs the lack of actual proof. It has taken some time and careful thought to get to this point, but we’re proud to make the change and we believe our customers will be pleased with it as well.' Petco has already began cutting down on the amount of Chinese-made treats three years ago, said Petco Vice President John Sturm. It expects to completely get rid of them in all its 1,300 stores by the end of this year.

"By . Julian Robinson . In a dazzling blaze of orange and black, three of the world's rarest tigers dash in to the outside world for the first time - after they were born in a British zoo. The Sumatran Tiger cubs - two females and a male - are the first baby tigers to be born at Flamingo Land Zoo near Malton, North Yorkshire, in more than 20 years. Playing in the great outdoors and nuzzling up to their proud mother, the eight-week-old infants add to a world population of the critically endangered species, which is estimated to be as low as 400. Leap of faith: Sumatran tiger cub Kuasa bounds off a rock in his enclosure at Flamingo Land, Malton, North Yorkshire after being let outside for the first time . Lying on her side in the long grass, proud mother Surya tenderly licks one of her eight-week-old Sumatran tiger cubs as it nuzzles up to her at an enclosure . Easy does it: One of the eight-week-old tiger cubs thinks about leaping off a rock as its mother watches. The young animals are still very much in their infancy and are still dependent on their mother . Zoo manager Ross Snipp has spoken of his pride at the popular zoo attraction helping to bring about a near one per cent increase in the species’ numbers. Mr Snipp said: 'It was a fantastic feeling when the cubs were born, a real sense of joy. 'As a zoo, it doesn’t get much better than breeding a critically endangered species. This is what we are here for. Surya with her Sumatran tiger cubs Mentari and Kuasa as the infants are allowed out in the grass for the first time. At the moment they weigh just seven kilos . On the prowl: Eight-week-old Kuasa explores her enclosure having been allowed out. The expected lifespan of its mother and father is around 20 years - in the wild average life expectancy for the species is just four years . Eyes burning bright, Surya closely guards one of her Sumatran tiger cubs, Mentari, as the pair prowl through the thick grass of their enclosure . Kuasa bounds across a gap in the rocks. The cubs are expected to be the future of the European breeding programme for the critically endangered species . With only their heads visible and their bodies concealed by the long grass, mother and cub enjoy the spring weather at Flamingo Land in Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire . According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are now fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild. The tiger subspecies is classed as 'critically endangered' and they are holding on for survival in remaining patches of forest on the island of Sumatra. Conservationists blame dwindling numbers on increased deforestation as well as continued poaching and the twin threats have sparked fears they could end up extinct. Although they are protected by law in Indonesia, with tough sentences handed out for poaching and heavy fines, there is still a 'substantial' market for tiger parts and products within Sumatra and wider Asia. Sumatran tigers weigh between 156 and 308 pounds and typically live in tropical areas of forest as well as peat swamp and freshwater swamp habitats. 'This has been seven years in the making and we are very proud to have delivered three healthy cubs.' The cubs - born on March 22 to mother Surya and father Bawa - were released into their outside enclosure for the very first time. At just eight weeks old, they are still very much in their infancy and still dependent on their mother for food. Surya lies in the shade while one of her cubs bounds over its sibling in a  playful scene. The cubs' parents arrived at Flamingo Land in 2010 in the hope that they would . produce offspring . One of the cubs receives a big lick from its proud mother as the pair relax in the grass. At this stage they are still feeding from their mother but over the last few weeks have learnt to move independently . Mentari and Bulan find some trees and rocks to explore as they get their first taste of the great outdoors having been born in March . Mr Snipp added: 'The cubs are still tiny compared to the size they will grow to and only weigh around seven kilos. 'At this stage they are still feeding from their mother but over the last few weeks have learnt to move independently and they are now all very active.' The cubs’ parents arrived at Flamingo Land in 2010 in the hope that they would produce offspring as part of a worldwide conservation effort to save the Sumatran Tiger from extinction. Surya and Mentari adopt the same position and look out in the same direction at their Flamingo Land enclosure. The world population of Sumatran Tigers is as low as 400 . Pictured left walking along a ridge, one of the eight-week-old cubs surveys its options as it takes a stroll outside for the first time. But another cub prefers to stay under the watchful eye of its mother Surya in the long grass . Mr Snipp added: 'These cubs are now the future of the European breeding programme. 'In 18 months time they could be transferred anywhere in Europe and hopefully paired with a suitable mate to continue the breeding process.' The average life expectancy of Sumatran tigers in the wild is only four years, but the expected lifespan of Surya and Bawa is more than 20 years.","Fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers are believed to exist in the world with poaching and deforestation the key threats .

The unidentified boy was at the White House on Tuesday as part of the Turnaround Arts Talent Show that First Lady Michelle Obama was hosting .

Before . the ear pulling happened, Mrs. Obama made a speech about the importance . of arts in education. She turned to her husband, who had made room in . his day and kissed him. Hello handsome: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama receives a kiss from President Barack Obama during her hosting of the Turnaround Arts Talent Show at the White House in Washington May 20, 2014 . President Obama took time out from his schedule to support his wife. Turnaround Arts is a program to help turn around low-performing schools and increase student achievement through arts education . First lady Michelle Obama dances on stage with student performers as she and the Presidentís Committee on the Arts and the Humanities (PCAH) host the White House Talent Show . THE kiss: The couple were caught on a kiss cam during an NBA game in July 2012 . Earlier this year, the couple were dogged by rumors their relationship was on the rocks. Some of the nastier murmurs of the 21-year marriage said the two have been racked by screaming rows, allegations of infidelity and a string of jealous fights. The White House has refused to comment on the reports. According to a report in the National Enquirer – which plastered ‘Obama Divorce Bombshell!’ across its front page in February  – the pair have been at loggerheads since last summer and are now sleeping in separate bedrooms. The ‘final straw’, apparently, was Michelle’s outrage when her husband publicly humiliated her by openly flirting and posing for his now infamous ‘selfie’ photograph with Denmark’s glamorous blonde Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service. According to published reports, Mrs Obama is only standing by her 52-year-old husband until his presidency ends.

Michelle grits her teeth and rolls her eyes skyward as Obama snaps his . now infamous 'selfie' with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt . and David Cameron at Nelson Mandela's memorial . But on Tuesday it was all about arts in education. Michelle Obama said that it isn't something to be introduced after student test scores go up, but is a critical element of achieving those higher test scores in the first place. The lawyer-turned-first lady argued her case while opening the first White House student talent show, featuring spirited song and dance routines by students whose schools had performed so poorly they were chosen for a new federal arts education program. By the end of the hourlong, toe-tapping, hand-clapping show in the East Room, which was bathed in a soothing orange light, and Mrs. Obama had joined all the students on the makeshift stage to dance during their closing number, which shared its name with her husband's 'Yes We Can' presidential campaign slogan. President Barack Obama even broke away from his work elsewhere in the White House to come and make his own pitch for arts education and to congratulate the elementary and middle-school-age performers. The talent show was a vehicle to showcase the Turnaround Arts program.

It was created as an experiment in 2012 by the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in collaboration with the White House and the Education Department to test whether arts education can help improve student outcomes and create more positive learning environments. Major artists adopted each school. Encouraged by the results so far, including higher reading and math scores and fewer disciplinary problems, Mrs. Obama announced that the program is being expanded this year from the original eight schools to 35 schools in 10 states — Iowa, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Louisiana, Oregon, Montana, Colorado, California, Illinois, Minnesota — and the District of Columbia. Two of the original eight schools have improved so much that they are no longer in 'turnaround' status, she said. Those schools are Findley Elementary School in Des Moines, Iowa, and Orchard Gardens in Boston. The arts, the first lady said, help get students excited about taking their seats in class because they are looking forward to the next musical they're performing in or the instrument they can't wait to play. 'But if they're not in their seats then we can't teach them anything at all,' Mrs. Obama said. 'The bottom line here is very clear: Arts education isn't something we add on after we've achieved other priorities, like raising test scores and getting kids into college. It's actually critical for achieving those priorities in the first place.'","The unidentified boy whispered into President Obama's ear on Tuesday during an arts talent show at the White House .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A widow whose husband's death in 2012 was wrongly deemed a suicide has spoken out about her battle to have the decision overturned. Investigations by the Buncombe County police and the area medical examiner concluded that the death of Clay Santimore, Shannon Santimore's husband, was an accident. However, the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled that the death was a suicide and dismissed Shannon Santimore's requests to overturn the decision. Moving forward: Shannon Santimore with her son, Matt, and twin daughters, Kate, left, and Ellie. Santimore's husband, Clay, died in a firearm accident in North Carolina that was wrongly ruled a suicide by the state medical examiners office . According to the Charlotte Observer, Clay Santimore traveled from the family's home in Massachusetts to Asheville, North Carolina on January 13, 2012, to visit an old friend, Kevin Gorman. Accidental: Shannon Santimore says her husband was in one of the happiest periods of his life and devoted to their three children before he died . As he and Gorman caught up, Scott Cole, a friend of Gorman's, arrived with two handguns. Gorman was considering purchasing a firearm and Cole was helping to advise him on what type would be appropriate. According to court records, Cole removed the magazine from a Glock handgun and dry-fired it before putting the magazine back in and placing it on a counter. According to Cole, Santimore then picked up the weapon and put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Cole says he then removed it from his mouth and pulled the slide back before replacing it in his mouth. What happened next, a judge eventually ruled, was not suicide but 'consistent with [Santimore's] personality as a prankster.' Santimore put the now-armed gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. Homicide detectives concluded that the death an accident, and that alcohol and Clay Santimore's 'unfamiliarity with firearms' and alcohol played a part, reports the Charlotte Observer. A local medical examiner, Dr Sharon Sweede, came to the same conclusion. However, Dr Jonathan Privette, an associate chief medical examiner, concluded that Clayton Santimore's death was a suicide and he and Dr Deborah Radische, the state's chief medical examiner, refused Shannon Santimore's pleas to examine the case more closely. She was not content to let sleeping dogs lie. At stake was $1.2 million in insurance payments, money she desperately needed to raise her children, and more importantly, her children's knowledge that their father did not intend to kill himself. Prankster: A judge ruled that Clay Santimore couldn't have known the gun was loaded when he put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger . Devoted: Shannon Santimore wanted her children to know that their father never intended to leave them . 'I needed . to find the answers for my children and be able to tell them without any . doubt that their dad did not leave them on purpose,' Shannon Santimore . told the Charlotte Observer. After a three-day hearing, a judge ruled that Clayton Santimore's death was accidental. He . found that not only did Privette come to his conclusion without taking . into account the conclusinos of the sheriff's office or the local . medical examiner. He . also relied on an incorrect definition of suicide, which doesn't take . into account whether or not the victim intended to kill themselves or . not. Tragic loss: Shannon and Clayton were parents to a young son and two baby twin girls when he died in the horrific accident . The judge criticized Privette because he 'failed to investigate and scrutinize all the evidence available,' which brought him to the wrong conclusion. Shannon Santimore had been awarded $300,000 in insurance following her husband's death. She was unaware that when the death was ruled an accident, she was entitled to a much larger sum. Now, she says, she can stay at home with her twin little girls until they start school as she and Clayton had planned. The Charlotte Observer contacted Privette for comment, but he refused to be interviewed, saying only, 'Based on my investigation, and even considering the subsequent administrative hearing, my opinion about the manner of death remains unchanged.'","Shannon Santimore had to fight in a North Carolina court to get the suicide ruling in her husband's death overturned .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A businessman's dream of sailing around the world ended in tragedy after he fell from a yacht he'd bought hours earlier and died in the cold waters of The Solent, a coroner heard today. Hany Mustapha, 46, from Worcester Park, Surrey, had just picked up a 21ft sloop bought through eBay and set sail in strong winds from Poole, Dorset, running into trouble minutes later. The yacht was discovered 'ghosting' hours later, running aground deserted on the Isle of Wight with its engine still running. Tragic: Hany Mustapha, 46, with his wife Liz Brown. He died of hypothermia in The Solent after falling overboard from a yacht he'd bought just hours earlier as part of a plan to sail around the world . A major air and sea search was launched but Mr Mustapha’s body was not found until it washed up on a nearby beach, five days later. The wealthy IT company director died from hypothermia rather than drowning, the island's coroner heard today. The inquest heard he was not as experienced as he believed and fell overboard just hours after buying the boat. Mr Mustapha was a member of a local motor yachting club on the River Thames and had completed a one-week sailing course with his second wife, Liz, in Turkey in 2011. He was also studying for his Master Yachtsman certificate in his spare time. However, the coroner said he had 'over-estimated his ability' when he attempted to sail single-handed in The Solent on October 27 last year. Last picture: Mr Mustapha seen sailing the yacht as it left Poole bay at 10.05am on October last year. A coroner said he had 'over-estimated his ability' when he attempted to sail single-handed in The Solent . Cold winds were almost at gale force strength, throwing up 15ft waves as Mr Mustapha ventured out on his solo voyage aboard his new boat, Brigand, from Poole harbour. He had bought the boat just hours before from airline pilot Sydney Mills, of Sherborne, Dorset, who had given him a 'comprehensive brief' of how to sail the boat, the coroner heard. It was thought that the businessman had not got far out of Poole harbour when he fell overboard in the choppy seas. He died of the cold within an hour . after becoming stranded in sea temperatures of less than 12 degrees . Celsius, the inquest heard. The father of two was wearing a basic buoyancy aid instead of a self-inflating lifejacket at the time. He . was also wearing 'inappropriate' trainers instead of non-slip boating . shoes and had not connected himself to the 'kill cord' which would have . cut power to the engine when he fell overboard, the coroner heard. 'Life and soul of the party': Mr Mustapha died of the cold within an hour falling into waters that were of temperatures of just 12C, the inquest heard . Mr Mustapha’s body was discovered face down in the shallows of Sandown Bay on the Isle of Wight on November 1 last year. He had large bruises to his forehead and nose. The inquest was told that the injuries may have been caused by the boom on the boat swinging around violently, knocking the 6ft 4ins tall father into the sea and leaving him stranded as his new yacht motored on ahead of him. Coroner Caroline Sumeray recorded that the tee-total father’s death was a 'terrible and tragic accident.' She added: 'Whilst it is clear Hany Mustapha had some experience of boats and some experience of marine qualifications, he I think over-estimated his abilities in respect of that trip he took in those conditions on that day.' The London-based businessman had paid Mr Mills £900 for the small wooden sailing boat as a 46th birthday present to himself and had plans to sail around the world with his wife of 11 years. Mr Mills said Mr Mustapha 'appeared very competent' and told him he was a Master Yachtsman - which was untrue. However, the former Royal Navy aviator admitted to having 'concerns' after he noticed Mr Mustapha's footwear. 'It was the shoes he was wearing. He was wearing black trainers but they were not deck shoes as far as I was aware. They didn’t have a non-slip sole on them. 'There was just something niggling in the back of my head - it was the shoes and the lifejacket and all the kit he had was brand new. 'It was shiny and hadn’t been used. It was not scuffed - it was brand new stuff.' However, he said Mr Mustapha had assured him he was a Master Yachtsman and he left him to set sail after he had given his buyer a 'comprehensive brief' of the boat. Mr Mills said he walked to the mouth of Poole harbour and snapped a few photos and a video of the boat he had owned for 10 years as Mr Mustapha sailed out just after 10am. He was the last person to see the businessman alive. Marie Celeste: The yacht was towed to Yarmouth Harbour by Hampshire Constabulary's Marine Unit after it was found after running aground, deserted on the Isle of Wight with its engine still running . Mr Mustapha’s wife, Liz Brown, whom he married in 2001, told the coroner of the horror of receiving the call from coastguards that her husband had disappeared. The alarm was raised after Brigand washed up at Grange Chine, Isle of Wight, at 5.20pm. It still had its engine running as it crashed into the shore. Ms Brown said she had arranged to call her husband at midday and every two hours to check his progress but had struggled to get through. 'I just assumed he was in an area with no phone signal,' she said. 'As soon as I heard this guy say he was the coastguard I knew something awful had happened. 'He said the boat had been found off the Isle of Wight but Hany was not on it. My heart sank. It’s all a bit of a blur from there.' Ms Brown, who said she met her husband while they worked for pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline in 1997, was co-director in their IT consultancy firm which they set up in 2000. She said they had joined Thames Motor Yacht Club in Surrey in September 2011, and planned to travel together. 'The aim was to retire early and go around the world. It’s something he had discussed for quite a while,' she told the inquest. Sad: Despite a major major air and sea search, Mr Mustapha's body was not found until five days after his boat when he washed up ashore face down in the shallows of Sandown Bay. His face was badly bruised . The day before picking up the new yacht, Mr Mustapha had celebrated his birthday at a Chinese restaurant in Surrey with his wife, his daughters from his first marriage, Nadia and Madeline, his Egyptian-born parents, his sister May, aged 47 years, and her three children. He then caught a train from Surbiton, Surrey, to Poole, Dorset at 11pm and stayed in a Holiday Inn Express in the town that night before picking up the boat in the morning. His daughter Nadia was not in court, but her younger sister sobbed as details of his death were revealed. Mr Mustapha’s Egytian-born surgeon father, Nabil, was also at the inquest to hear the evidence and took notes throughout the proceedings. Paying tribute to her husband at the inquest today, his widow said: 'He was quite a tall chap at 6ft 4ins and I think his personality matched his physical height. 'Everybody who met him remembered his character. He was a very friendly person, he would go out of his way to help anybody even if he didn’t know them. He was a very kind man. 'He was very intelligent - he had run his own company for a number of years. And he was always good company to be around. 'He was always the life and soul of the party.'","Hany Mustapha died attempting to single-handedly navigate his new yacht in The Solent in rough seas .

The source said: ‘Michael had genuine health reasons for not being there on the day but that doesn’t mean he should be permanently excluded from the cast photo. ‘He’s taking time out of the show to sort out his personal issues but he’s very much part of the Corrie family. ‘The . decision was taken to slip in a shot of him at a later date and I . highly doubt whether most people would have even noticed he wasn’t there . for real.’ A jubilant Michael Le Vell pictured with a pint of lager after he was cleared of child sex abuse charges last year . A professional photographer is said to have taken a picture of the star on his own and in the same position he would have been standing in if he had been at the official photo shoot. Last month it was reported that Mr Le Vell had checked himself out of rehab at The Priory in Greater Manchester after going three weeks without a drink. Le Vell attended the clinic after he admitted in the Sunday Mirror that he used cocaine to cope with stress during his trial in September when he was cleared of child sex abuse charges.

She said: ‘The dog jumped up off the bed and went to the bedroom door looking really distressed and making weird noise, which we thought was a bit odd. ‘My partner opened the door and Molly flew across the landing towards the spare room. We couldn’t believe it when we opened the door and saw the fox was calmly sitting in the corner on the bed. ‘Colin was a bit of an action hero covering himself in a mac and gloves holding a rake to try to coax it out of the bedroom. It was quite a shock.’ The couple managed to capture the moment the fox was ushered down the stairs on video, with footage showing it staring at the family before quickly running off. Ms Preddy: ‘We didn’t know how to get rid of it and I actually think it was sick, which was the scary thing. ‘It wasn’t acting in a normal way and was covered in mange, which can get passed on so it wasn’t nice. The couple managed to capture the moment the fox was ushered down the stairs on video, with footage showing it staring at the family before quickly running off . ‘I phoned the RSPCA and it took forever to get through to someone but when I finally did we were told to block off the rest of the house and wait for it to saunter downstairs. ‘It took about an hour to leave but it could’ve taken all day which is a horrible thought.’ She said her adult stepsons were both in their bedrooms with the doors closed when the fox was discovered but said she ‘dread to think what could have happened’ if her seven-month-old grandson had been staying at the house. However, son James, 26, managed to make light of the situation and quipped:  ‘When I said I was hoping to wake up with a fox in my bedroom this weekend, I didn’t mean literally.’ The family have been plagued by foxes in the past and now feel like ‘prisoners in their own home’ because they can’t leave their doors open anymore. Ms Preddy said: ‘Urban foxes are always so disgusting and manky and we’ve had problems with them before fouling everywhere. The couple spent over an hour trying to coax the fox out of their home but eventually it decided to run off . The family have been plagued by foxes in the past and now feel like 'prisoners in their own home' because they can't leave their doors open anymore . ‘I grew up in the country and they are a different breed of animal there. ‘I think we’re going to a real epidemic because the problem is just getting worse, which is very scary. ‘Now we can’t leave the patio doors open and feel like prisoners in our own home. ‘I am completely freaked out and haven’t been in the spare room since because the thought of going where the manky, mangy creature has been all over the duvet makes me feel sick.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘It is unusual for foxes to enter homes as by nature they will tend to avoid human contact. ‘In the rare instances when they do venture into a home, it is likely they are attracted to food which has been left out.’","Labrador dog alerted family to fox sleeping in bedroom at Essex home .

A mother of a three-year-old boy, who remains in a critical condition in a Sydney hospital, screamed in horror as she watched her son chase his father across a busy road before being struck by an oncoming motorist in Sydney's west. Onlookers rushed to the boy's aid following the accident at Blacktown on Wednesday - while the mother sobbed and screamed at the scene, bashing the bonnet of the driver's car in a struggle to come to terms with what had just happened. A witness said the shocked mother's screams were so loud she thought she was hearing a domestic dispute. Scroll down for video . A desperate woman wails by the side of the road after a boy, 3, was hit by a car . 'I heard a woman screaming and crying and hitting a car ... I thought it was a domestic dispute,' she told the Daily Telegraph. The boy was flown to Westmead Children's Hospital and remains in a life-threatening condition having suffered severe internal and head injuries. At about the same time yesterday a man, 59, hit another young boy in what was reported as a hit and run incident at Haberfield in Sydney's inner west. He last night handed himself in to police following the incident which saw a two-year-old boy hospitalised with cuts and bruises. The Croydon Park man attended Burwood Police station last night and was issued with an infringement notice for failing to exchange details. Meanwhile, a CareFlight spokesman Ian Badham told The Sydney Morning Herald that the injuries sustained by the young boy in the Blacktown accident were serious. 'Critical injuries would be an understatement,' he said. 'Our doctors worked with paramedics on the scene have placed him in an induced coma,' he said. Mr Badham also confirmed that his mother and father were with him when the accident happened. Nine News report that witnesses told them the boy's father stepped out on to busy Reservoir Road, not realising his son was running behind him - and the young boy was then hit by a car. An off-duty nurse who was driving by stopped to help the young child before paramedics arrived, the program also said.

"By . Louise Cheer . The slip, slop, slap message is proving to be effective with melanoma rates plummeting in the past 18 years. A long-term study of teenagers and young adults has revealed the cases of melanoma in young people fell 5 per cent each year from the mid-1990s to 2010. Research leader Adele Green said it showed the effectiveness of sun safety messages. Skin cancer is declining, according to a major new study . Prof Green has been studying skin cancer at QIMR Beghofer Medical Reasearch Institute in Queensland for more than three decades. She and her team looked at melanoma cases among 15 to 24 year olds in Queensland from 1982 to 2010. 'It's been one of the most successful cancer prevention campaigns,' Prof Green said of the slip, slop, slap campaign. '(We looked at) young people who have been exposed to the sun safe message and early detection programs since birth.' Results could also be similar across the rest of Australia, she added. According to the study published online in the International Journal of Cancer, the rate of melanoma cases has fallen from 25 per 100,000 in 1996 to 14 per 100,000 in 2010 among people aged 20 to 24. It follows data released by the institute in April that showed a decline in the most common skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among people aged up to 45. 'This shows the improvements are broader than just the adolescents and young adults in the melanoma study,' Prof Green said. 'The effectiveness of the sun safe message is up there with the anti-smoking and the asbestos campaigns. 'I am convinced we can make people much healthier and happier if we prevent chronic diseases rather than treat them. Professor Green said sun safety campaigns like slip, slop, slap were having a significant effect on the decline of melanoma cases . 'The culture is changing. Australians know the sun is dangerous as well as wonderful.' But despite the good news, Queensland still has the highest rate of melanoma cases in the world. Cancer Council CEO Professor Ian Olver said the sun safe message was an excellent example of a public health campaign. But Cancer Council CEO Ian Olver said people needed to be vigilant with their sun safety - Queensland still has the highest rate of melanoma in the world . 'Australia is known for its high rate of melanoma, but it has been able to lead the world in prevention,' he said. 'We are into the second generation with the sun smart message. 'The important thing is to keep the message going. 'This is not a time to relax just because it is working.'","Melanoma cases in young people have fallen 5 per cent a year since 1990s .

Richard Dafydd Vevar, from Wrexham, north Wales, has been charged with two offences against a boy aged between 13 and 16, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The offences are alleged to have taken place between 1986 and 1989. Richard Dafydd Vevar, 62, from Wrexham, has been bailed to appear at . Dolgellau Magistrates' Court after being charged with two counts of . indecent assault against a teenage boy . He has been bailed to appear at Dolgellau Magistrates' Court on June 2. Vevar is the second man to be charged as part of an investigation into historic child abuse in North Wales, known as Operation Pallial. The investigation, led by Keith Bristow, director general of the NCA, was set up to re-examine allegations that a paedophile ring targeted care and children's homes in the area between 1953 and 1995. Twenty people have been arrested since the new inquiry was announced by Home . Secretary Theresa May in December 2011, following allegations of abuse from children aged between six and 19. Another man, John Allen, 72, was charged with a string of child sex offences and awaits trial later this year. Mr Allen faces 39 counts in total, including 29 alleging indecent assault. He denies all charges. Latest figures show 37 people have been investigated as suspects under Pallial. A total of 255 people have reported allegations to the NCA, of which information from 212 is under active investigation at this time. A total of 28 care homes in North Wales currently feature in the investigation. At the time the investigation was announced, Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, from Merseyside Police, senior investigating officer for the inquiry, said: 'Operation Pallial is investigating new allegations of historic child abuse, some from victims previously known about and some from victims who have come forward for the first time. 'All victims of abuse have a right to expect all allegations of abuse, no matter how much time has passed, to be investigated professionally and appropriately. We will do so. 'Equally importantly, if offenders are still alive, they must be identified, investigated and brought to justice, with those who still have access to children being prioritised.'

"By . Aap . The killer of a Sydney woman who bludgeoned her to death with a rock, crushing her face and then dumping her body on a bush track has been jailed, more than 20 years after her 'barbaric' rape and murder. Steve Isac Matthews, 43, was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and three months behind bars on Thursday in the NSW Supreme Court for the murder of Pia Navida, AAP reports. Ms Navida was a  37-year-old Filipino woman who had come to Australia in the early 1980s as a bride. She got involved in drugs, fell into a nomadic lifestyle and began working as a prostitute near Sydney's Central Railway Station. In January 1992, she disappeared. Bushwalkers found her underwear and clothing scattered at Bundeena, in the Royal National Park on the south coast of NSW on February 1, and her body was uncovered soon afterwards. Face crushed: After coming to Australia from the Philippines as a young bridge, Pia Navida fell into drugs and prostitution and in January 1992 the 37-year-old was taken to the Royal National Park south of Sydney where she was raped by Steve Matthews, 20, then bludgeoned with a large rock which crushed in her face . Terrible find: Bushwalkers hiking at Bundeena in bushland on the NSW south coast on February 1, 1992 found these clothes belonging to murder victim Pia Navida scattered on a bush track. The dead woman's body was found soon aftewards . Police determined she had been raped and then bludgeoned to death with a large rock, completely crushing her face, her body then dragged a small distance and dumped. The case went unsolved until 2011 when advances in DNA technology allowed police to match semen found on and inside Ms Navida's body to Steve Isaac Matthews and another man, Rodney James Paterson. The men were charged, but Paterson maintained his innocence. Justice Geoffrey Bellew acquitted him in March after upholding Paterson's application that the evidence was incapable of convincing a jury of his guilt. Body found: a track through the bushland at Bundeena in the Royal National Park south of Sydney, where Filipina woman Pia Navida's body was found 22 years ago and for whose murder a man, Steve Matthews, has finally been sent to prison for a minimum of 16 years and three months . Justice Bellew told the court on Thursday Matthews had taken a girlfriend for picnics to Bundeena, where Ms Navida was found, when he dated her in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Matthews had told her he had killed a person in a bush area and demonstrated to her what he had done. He would have been 21 at the time.The court heard Matthews was himself a victim of a major assault in 2005, which had left him with a serious brain injury and little memory of his earlier life.Justice Bellew said that while Matthews had recently shown remorse, saying he was 'sickened and disgusted' by his actions, his criminal history did not allow for leniency in his sentence. Justice Geoffrey Bellew said Matthews's maximum sentence of 21 years and six months was appropriate given the ""barbaric"" and ""horrendous"" nature of his crime.Matthews will be eligible for parole in November 2027.","The 37-year-old victim Pia Navida was bludgeoned to death with a rock .

"By . Eleanor Steafel . The Jamaica Inn on Bodmin and its 6.5-acre site is on the market for £2 million . The haunted inn on the Cornish coast that formed the backdrop for Daphne du Maurier's bestselling tale about murderous wreckers is on the market for £2 million. Jamaica Inn inspired the famous du Maurier novel which was later adapted into the 1939 Hitchcock film and a 1983 television drama starring Jane Seymour. The story will be returning to screens later this year when Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown Findlay will take the lead role in a new BBC adaptation. The inn and its 6.5-acre site is now being sold by owners John and Wendy Watts. Mr and Mrs Watts have been running the inn since 1973, inviting fans of the famous writer to stay in one of their 17-bedrooms, which are named after characters from the novel. The site is surrounded by the Cornish coves and estates familiar to du Maurier enthusiasts. The couple have also established a museum on-site that Mr Watts says has 'probably the finest genuine collection of smuggling artefacts in the country'. The museum and its entire collection, which includes du Maurier's original writing desk, will be sold with the inn, and the owners also expect the majority of the staff to stay on. The site, which is being sold via Christie & Co, will essentially be 'sold as seen', according to director Matthew Smith. He said: 'We anticipate strong interest from the start. Hopefully it won't be on the market for too long.' The du Maurier novel is considered to be a Gothic classic, telling the tale of a ruthless, bloody gang who lured ships onto the rocks on the Cornish coastline before murdering the survivors and robbing them. The hotel has a similarly eerie history. Built in 1750, Jamaica Inn was used as a coaching inn by weary travellers using the turnpike between Launceston and Bodmin. A far cry from Downton Abbey: Jessica Brown Findlay (pictured) takes the lead role in a new BBC adaptation of Jamaica Inn . Jane Seymour (left) starred in the 1983 TV version of Jamaica Inn, based on the Daphne du Maurier (right) book . Travellers would stay a night at the remote and isolated inn after having made the treacherous journey across the moor. Jamaica Inn is the story of young Mary Yellan who is forced to move in with her Aunt Patience after her mother dies. When Mary arrives in Launceston she discovers her aunt living under the rule of her husband, Joss Merlyn, who is the crooked keeper of Jamaica Inn. Mary quickly falls into a life of crime, joining the group of wreckers led by Joss and his brother, Jem, who run ships aground and murder sailors to steal their loot. Against her better judgement she develops feelings for Jem, a penny thief whose crimes are less severe than his older brother's. After several attempts to expose Joss as the criminal he is, Mary discovers him alongside her Aunt Patience who have been stabbed to death. She returns to her native Helford, but flees one day after seeing her beloved Jem walking across the moors with all his possessions. The building is also reputed to be one of the most haunted places in Britain. Mr Watts, 76, said: 'My wife and I have stayed there on a few occasions in the old part of the building and at night the room would go very cold. That's all I am going to say - it is totally unexplainable.' 'We also get a lot of visitors who have had funny experiences. The old generator house [which has since been redeveloped] was definitely a very eerie spot and most people didn't want to go in there.' Du Maurier's bestselling novel has been enjoyed by generations through the many screen adaptaions of the tale. Maureen O'Hara made her name in Alfred Hitchcock's 1939 film. Jane Seymour starred in the 1983 television drama. The tale is set to return to our screens later this year, when former star of Downton Abbey Jessica Brown Findlay will take on the leading role in a new three-part BBC adaptation. It is thought Jamaica Inn may have originally got its name from the infamous rum trade carried out there. The Jamaica Inn is situated in an isolated and remote part of Bodmin, Cornwall . The bar at the Jamaica Inn reflects the site's sinister past . Charles Laughton starring in Alfred Hitchcock's 1939 version of Jamaica Inn . Some visitors were reported to use the inn to hide the contraband they had smuggled ashore. It is estimated that half of the brandy and a quarter of the tea being smuggled into the UK at this time came in via the Devon and Cornish coasts. This was comparatively simple as there were few people around to enforce the law. Even when a smuggler was caught, he was usually dealt with leniently by the presiding magistrates, most of whom were apparently willing recipients of the smuggled goods.

"By . Mia De Graaf . These amazing pictures show Britain’s last remaining mud-horse fisherman still at work and determined to continue using the centuries old technique - despite falling profits. Adrian Sellick, 56, is the fifth generation of his family to use the method, which sees him lie on his belly and push a wooden sledge across mudflats. The bizarre technique allows him to get to the tide’s edge where he sticks stakes into the mud and hangs nets between them to catch shrimp. Adrian Sellick, 56, slides to the tide¿s edge where he sticks stakes into the mud and hangs nets between them . He is the fifth generation of his family to use the method, which sees him lie on his belly sliding over mudflats . He learned art from his father, Brendan, when he was just eight years old . Mr Sellick, of Somerset, learned the art from his father, Brendan, when he was just eight years old and says he plans to continue for at least another decade. His father, who harvested shrimps, eels, cod, sea bass and dog fish, worked for 60 years before ‘retiring’ into the family shop. But father-of-four Mr Sellick said dwindling numbers of fish and shrimps meant he was now forced to take a night job to make ends meet. He said: 'I can’t survive on what I make now, it’s not sustainable like it used to be years ago. The supermarkets have come in now and taken all our business away. William Sellick, Adrian's grandfather, shows off his findings aged 16 (left) and again at the age of 62 (right) Tradition: Brendan Sellick, Adrian's father, is pictured here hard at work at the age of 16 . The technique has been practiced for centuries, and two generations ago it was commonplace . A mudhorse is a cross between a barrow and a sledge with a flat wooden base and a plank sticking out. The base is a wooden cage made up of four poles. The fisherman loads it with buckets and kets and pushes it out two miles into the mud when the tide is low. To set up the nets at a strategic point, they must have an encyclopedic knowledge of the flats and fish. It is then a waiting game. When the tide goes out again, there should be a bounty of catch in the nets. 'We put it down to living next door to Hinkley Power Station too, we have lost a good 75 per cent of our shrimp since that was put in. 'We used to get loads of shrimp years ago, now I’m lucky to get a basket full. 'I work nights at Yeo Creamery now to make ends meet. That is my income, that’s what we survive on. 'I really enjoy mud-horse fishing, I would rather be outside than in a stuffy factory, but that is the reality now.' The mud-horse is a hand-built wooden sledge which enables Adrian to navigate his way over the treacherous mudflats of Bridgwater Bay. The technique was used by many families only a couple of generations ago. Once he has sledged out and set up the stakes, he simply waits for the tide to wash in and out - flinging fish into the nets. Mr Sellick added: 'I was about eight or nine when I first went out, my dad used to put nets down and I would go out and collect the fish twice a day. 'That shows you how things change. Brendan (right) has since 'retired' to run the family fish shop in Somerset, selling fish caught by Adrian (left) Despite the dwindling number of shrimp in Bridgwater Bay, they are determined to continue the trade . Both found the technique difficult at first but agree that it is worth the effort . 'As long as I can I will continue, unless someone like my sister wants to take it over. It’s a young man’s job now.' The senior Mr Sellick, Brendan, who still prepares fish at the family’s shop, added: 'I can remember my dad putting me in a basket two miles out, dad chasing a conger eel and me being worried. 'I can see him now, I was just a titch.'","Adrian Sellick, 56, is the 5th generation in his family to use the method .

"By . Becky Barrow . and Richard Spillett . Open all hours: The Royal Mail is to open parcel delivery centres on Sundays as part of a trial . Royal Mail yesterday revealed plans to tackle the boom in online shopping by delivering parcels and opening sorting offices on Sundays. The move, which has been backed by unions, will be a relief to those who miss the post during the week and end up wasting their Saturday mornings queuing at their local office to pick up a parcel. It is also a sign of the increasing importance of parcels to Royal Mail – it handles more than one billion of them every year – which will today reveal its first annual financial results since it was privatised last October. As letters continue their serial decline because of text messaging, social media websites and email, the increasing popularity of online shopping means that parcels now account for more than half of the company’s revenues. Yesterday the Communication Workers’ Union (CWU), which bitterly opposed the privatisation of the company last year, welcomed the news but said working on a Sunday must be voluntary and is negotiating a higher pay rate for those who choose to do so. At present, sorting offices are only open from Monday to Friday as well as Saturday morning. Starting this summer, around 100 of Britain’s 1,400 busiest delivery offices will be open every Sunday afternoon. If the pilot scheme proves successful, it will be expanded and become permanent. Parcelforce Worldwide, Royal Mail’s express parcel business, will start Sunday deliveries next month when selected online retailers will be able to offer it to their customers. This will be open to around 97 per cent of Britain’s addresses, but excludes Northern Ireland and some remote areas. The group have done a deal with the Communications Workers Union (CWU) to secure the changes . Royal Mail will also trial delivering . parcels between businesses within the M25 on Sundays and open its . distribution network later at the weekends. As . a result, people who shop online at the weekend have a better chance of . receiving their package on Monday, rather than waiting until later in . the week for it to arrive. Royal . Mail chief executive Moya Greene said: ‘Through these new Sunday . services we are exploring ways to improve our flexibility and provide . more options for people to receive items they have ordered online. ‘The support of the Communication Workers Union has enabled us to respond quickly to a changing market.’ Royal Mail chief Moya Greene says the move will offer 'greater flexibility' to people who order things online . In . a statement, Royal Mail said: ‘The investment in extended opening hours . builds on the choices already available to people who are not at home . when delivery is attempted.’ And . Nick Langdon, managing director of Royal Mail parcels, told Radio 4’s . Today programme yesterday that parcels are ‘a big part of our future’. He . added: ‘Letters remain extremely important to us, and will do for many . years to come. Parcels now represent over half of our revenue in the . UK.’ Dave Ward, the CWU’s . deputy general secretary, said: ‘We appreciate that in order to stay . competitive in a broadly unregulated sector Royal Mail has to expand its . services to its customers. We believe that offering Sunday delivery and . collection services is the right response from the company. ‘With . ever-increasing numbers of people opting to shop online, Sunday . services are necessary to deal with the growing demand in parcel . delivery. ‘The union is . negotiating with Royal Mail to ensure that postal workers who are . affected by these changes receive good terms and conditions and, where . appropriate, that work is performed on a voluntary basis.’ The first official postal service was formed when Brian Tuke was appointed 'Master of the Posts' by Henry VIII in 1512 and the Royal Mail was established in 1516. But the first public service was not created until more than a century later, during the reign of Charles I, when letters began being carried between posts by 'post-boys'. Parliament then fixed postal rates depending on number of pieces of paper and distance in 1657. In 1793, official Letter Carriers were given a uniform of a scarlet coat and black hat. Despite the new clothes making the men more look more respectable, they were primarily designed to stop them sneaking into pubs while on shift. The first railway postal carriage on which letters were sorted in transit was brought in 1838, a system which continued until 2004. The world's first adhesive stamp was brought in in 1840, called the Penny Black, and 68 million were used in their first year. The first pillar boxes came in 1852, and were originally green to blend in with the landscape, but red ones were brought in from 1874 after people complained of finding them difficult to locate. The first postcode came in 1959 before the Post Office was changed from a government department to a statutory corporation by a 1969 act of Parliament. The current government then allowed for up to 90 per cent of Royal Mail to be privatised, with at least 10 per cent of shares to be held by Royal Mail employees. Business Secretary Vince Cable was accused of selling the company off on the cheap after the original stock market price of £3.3billion rose to more than £5billion after the company was floated.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former model who won £32million in her divorce from her first husband has had her second husband jailed in a row over their £40million fortune. Fashionista Alisa Thiry secured the eight-figure settlement when she split from French Connection boss Stephen Marks, father of her three children, in 2004. The wealthy divorcee then married Belgian businessman and property magnate Didier Thiry, 52, who was already worth £8million when their relationship began, a court was told. Jailed: Didier Thiry, 52 has been sent to prison for 'flagrant' contempt of court during his multi-million pound divorce battle with his wife Alisa . Didier Thiry's four-month sentence is the result of a row between the pair about a £13.8million loan . The couple live on the exclusive Kensington Park Gardens in London and their shared assets include a luxury beach house on the Caribbean island of St Barts, where they met. But Mrs Thiry, 49, is now in the throes of her second multi-million pound divorce battle – and yesterday Mr Justice Newton ordered that her husband be sent to prison for ‘flagrant’ contempt of court. His four-month sentence is the result of a row between the pair about a £13.8million loan. Alisa Thiry, pictured left with her first husband Stephen Marks and pictured right at a fundraising event in Kew, has had her second husband Didier Thiry jailed, in a court battle over their £45m assets . The High Court heard that Mrs Thiry, who has worked as creative director at French Connection and fashion editor of Elle, was already wealthy when she met her second husband – not least as a result of her first divorce. And after they had married, as ‘part of very complex financial arrangements between husband and wife’, a company owned by Mrs Thiry made a loan of some £13.8million to one of Mr Thiry’s companies. Mrs Thiry claims this has never  been paid off – and judge Sir Peter Singer made an order requiring  Mr Thiry, who runs a boutique hotel  in Belgium, to disclose information relating to the loan to Mrs Thiry on March 12 this year. But Harry Oliver, representing Mrs Thiry, told the court that Mr Thiry had failed to comply with that order. The barrister said Mrs Thiry wanted ‘vital information regarding a bond issued over companies relevant to [the divorce] proceedings, and how a loan owed to the wife, that is the central object of proceedings, worth [£13.8million] plus, will be met.’ Mr Oliver said Mr Thiry’s failure  to . comply with the order showed  disregard for both his wife and the . British court system, adding: ‘The breach is a breach of … explicit . court orders to provide relevant and necessary information. ‘It is of course a breach of the  fundamental duty of full and  frank disclosure. The 49-year-old former model (pictured) walked away with an eight-figure settlement after splitting from Mr Marks, the co-founder of French Connection, in 2004 after the couple had three children together . Battle: She then married Belgian businessman and property magnate, Didier Thiry, 52, but now the couple, whose assets include a luxury beach house on the Caribbean island of St Barthelemy (pictured), are divorcing . ‘Such a duty is the bedrock  upon which the efficacy of the  court process in financial remedy  proceedings is based.’ Urging . the judge to jail Mr Thiry, he went on: ‘The husband is hampering not . just the wife but this court’s proper exercise of its function. It is . submitted that a fine … will neither be sufficient punishment nor secure . future compliance.’ Jailing . Mr Thiry for four months, Mr Justice Newton said his contempt in . failing to disclose the information had been ‘flagrant’ and he had . ‘simply failed to comply with the order’. He added: ‘I take the view . that this type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. Mrs Thiry worked as creative director at French Connection and fashion editor of Elle. Right, her first husband, Mr Marks, whom she split from in 2004 . ‘It . must be understood by this  husband, and by all husbands, that when . considerable time, money  and effort have been expended, it is simply . unacceptable for the court to be treated in this way. ‘I find the contempt proved … and  in the circumstances I propose to  pass an immediate sentence of four months imprisonment.’ The judge also ordered the husband to pay £10,000 in legal costs. Mr Justice Newton added that Mr Thiry is currently in Belgium but he will be arrested the next time he sets foot on UK soil. However, . he gave him an opportunity to apply for a hearing to ‘purge his . contempt’ by handing over the information ordered by the court and . offering an apology. Mrs Thiry declined to comment  outside court after the hearing.  Her husband did not attend and was not represented.","Alisa Thiry, 49, divorced French Connection founder Stephen Marks in 2004 .

He may have narrowly missed out on guiding Liverpool to their first league title in 24 years, but Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is all smiles as he enjoys an outing with Charlotte Hind and her daughter at a small village in Spain. Rodgers clearly gets along well with the little girl as he was seen sharing a tender moment, giving her a hug as her mother, 31, the former travel coordinator of the club,  looked on smiling. The trio looked relaxed and happy as they went shopping and for a stroll in the sun-kissed locale. Break: Brendan Rodgers and female friend Charlotte Hinds were pictured on an outing in a small Spanish village . Calm: Rodgers looked relaxed as he enjoyed the warm weather with Hind and her daughter . The Reds manager, 41, was also pictured lifting the little girl out of the child seat of a shopping trolley. Ms Hind is divorcing her husband of five years Steven but Rodgers has denied having a relationship with Ms Hind. Last month Rodgers was at Ms Hind's home when a man battered the front door with a cricket bat. Rodgers was at the Birkdale, Southport, home of Ms Hind when the man pulled up in his car and began honking his horn and hurling abuse. Change: Rodgers has moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb of Liverpool for £1.2million . Close: Rodgers was pictured giving the little girl a hug as the three went shopping . Rodgers told the man, believed to be in his early 20s, to leave, but he instead started swearing and shouting for Rodgers to come into the street, before grabbing the bat from his car and attacking the front door. He then jumped back in his car and left. Neighbours called the police and three squad cars arrived, but the man was gone. A neighbour told the Mirror: 'He pulled up outside and he was blowing on the horn. 'Then he got out, went to the boot and got a cricket bat out, it looked new, I think it still had the labels on.' Grin: Rodgers, who has enjoyed a successful season in charge of Liverpool, smiles as he loads the car . Play: Rodgers lifts the child into the air as his companion looks on smiling .

Rodgers has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat. The father-of-two has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training ground. Mr Rodgers has also moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan, according to The Sun's Guy Patrick, and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb of the city for £1.2million.

"By . Australian Associated Press . A deranged truck driver with an apparent explosive strapped to his head caused pandemonium in Melbourne this morning, forcing a freeway to close and people to evacuate cars. Police evacuated about 150 motorists from their vehicles and shut the Monash Freeway for three hours following the pursuit of a 35-year-old South Caulfield with 'psychiatric issues.' After a short pursuit at speeds of up to 100km/hr into oncoming traffic, police managed to stop the man but noticed a suspicious device believed to be an explosive strapped to his head. Scroll down for video . Chaos: A 35-year-old Melbourne man forced the Monash Freeway into lockdown this morning after telling police he was carrying a bomb . After a short period of negotiations the man took off his clothes and surrendered to police. The Bomb Response Unit checked the device he was wearing and confirmed that it was not a bomb. Detective Acting Sen-Sgt Martin Bourke told The Herald Sun the man could easily have caused a disastrous crash. 'It was incredibly risky ... if we had trucks going 100km/h in each direction colliding that would have caused major issues and we probably would have had some fatalities,' he said. While the driver was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol he was having difficulty making a sense. 'Clearly he had psychiatric issues and that’s being evaluated,' he said. No threats were made to police during the incident and Sen-Sgt Bourke said the truck driver, who had no criminal record, had not explained his actions. Roads were re-opened at about 7am. However, the incident, which began at about 4am, caused major delays during the morning peak period. 'It's like closing Sydney Harbour Bridge, you know how disastrous it can be,' 3AW's Neil Mitchell told Today. The man, from Caulfield South, was arrested at the scene following a stand-off with police which lasted about an hour. 'When officers arrived, they located what appeared to be a suspicious device strapped to the driver,' a statement from Victoria police read. Police ordered an exclusion zone around the scene near Toorak Rd at Glen Iris and the Bomb Response Unit was called. An area around the truck was cordoned off by police, and around 150 motorists evacuated back to a safe distance. The inbound lanes of the Monash Freeway were blocked off at Warrigal Road while drivers were advised to use Dandenong Road, Queens Road and Kingsway to get into the city. The Age reported the man faces a number of potential charges including recklessly endangering life.","Police attended reports truck broke down, forcing 150 people from their car .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . Homebuyers in their twenties are becoming an ‘endangered species’ because of soaring house prices, a report has warned. Just 6 per cent of people who managed to buy a home last month were aged between 18 and 30, according to the National Association of Estate Agents. Mark Hayward, managing director of the NAEA, said he clearly  remembered a meeting around 20 years ago when his colleagues expressed their concern that the age of a first-time buyer had risen from 24 to 27. The shocking study shows that just six per cent of home buyers are under the age of 31 . He described the latest  figures as ‘shocking’ and ‘disconcerting’, and said many young people had no chance of buying unless they were helped by their parents. The report also revealed the battle homebuyers faced to secure their dream home, with too many people chasing too few homes for sale. There is an average of 392 buyers registered with each estate agent, the highest number for eight years, but the typical estate agency has just 45 homes for sale. The Bank of England said yesterday many people could be ‘speculating that they might benefit from higher prices if they delayed putting their properties on the market.’ The NAEA report, which was its first investigation into the age of homebuyers, said 94 per cent of homebuyers who managed to buy last month were aged 31 and over. ‘Homebuyers under the age of  31 have become an endangered  species,’ it said. Of all the homebuyers in April, 50 per cent were aged 31 to 40, 35 per cent were 41 to 55 and 9 per cent were aged 56 and over. Increasingly, young people are forced to continue living with their parents or move into rental accomodation . Official figures show a person in their twenties with a full-time job typically earns £21,196. But the average house price is £252,000 in the UK, or £459,000 in London where prices are rising by 17 per cent a year. By the end of next year, the average house price will have risen to £285,000, or £560,000 in London, accountants Pricewaterhouse Coopers said this week. Pensioners dominate the country’s homeowners, making up around one in three, according to the Government’s English Housing Survey. Many first bought in their twenties and have gradually moved up the ladder, benefiting from rising house prices. Today, fewer than 10 per cent of homeowners in England are under the age of 35. Mr Hayward said young people, who cannot afford to buy but would like to get on the property ladder, find it frustrating to watch prices go up without being able to benefit. A record 3.3million Britons aged  20 to 34 are living with their parents, equal to one in four of this age  group, according to the Office for National Statistics. However, a further 510,000 people aged 35 to 64 also continue to live with their parents, typically still in the childhood bedroom in which they grew up.","Workers in their 20s earn on average just £21,000 a year compared with the £285,000 cost of a home .

"By . Louise Cheer . His brilliant pictures have already won him 11,000 followers and made him Queenland's king of Instagram. So it's hard to believe that Alex Korica only turned 20 yesterday and is an entirely self-taught photographer who started uploading his pictures to the social media site in January 2013. His account is now away with eye-wateringly bright photographs of Australia, from stunning seascapes to brilliantly lit inner-city streets. The pictures have seen him lauded as one of Esquire's top travel photographers to follow on Instagram. Alex Korica captures the many attractions of Australia in vivid photographs posted on Instagram: 'Bird-Cage Alley' in Sydney (officially known as Angel Place) and the glowing interior of St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne . A city centre church nestled in between towering office blocks in Brisbane (left) while this vertigo-inducing image (right) was taken from Sydney Tower Skywalk . The Brisbane man said Instagram was an outlet for his photography. 'It was always a passion since I was very young, and Instagram started me off,' he said. 'I find a happiness when I can find something I like and find something that someone else likes and make people think differently about it. 'Everyone can see a waterfall but I take that extra step to show people a different angle from what we always see. 'That’s something I’ve always wanted to do as a photographer.' The 20-year-old also takes shots of street art, including graffiti in Brisbane (left) and Hosier Lane, Melbourne, which are eye-wateringly bright . These shots were taken by setting steel wool on fire and spinning it. The photographer uses a slow shutter speed to capture the whorls of fire . Korica does not like to be pigeon-holed as a landscape photographer but likes to keep his followers in suspense about what he posts. 'I aim to post two photos a day,' he said. 'I don’t like specialising in things, I like to keep my audience in surprise about when I post next. I like landscape, streetscapes and ocean photography, and I’m slowly expanding into portrait photography.' But the followers didn't come flock easily to Korica. 'It was a slow start and it was shock to me to see numbers growing and growing every single day,' he said. The Instagrammer snapped this shot of an old ship out at Redcliffe in Queensland (left) and used a tilt shift lens to capture Circular Quay in Sydney from above . Sights of the sea: The coral reef (left) is really inside an aquarium while Alex is on familiar territory with this brilliantly coloured picture of sea and sky . Sunset at Jindalee a suburb on the outskirts of Brisbane (left) and a portrait of a firey sky . Korica's favourite photo is one he took at Natural Bridge near Queensland's Gold Coast that got the attention of Tourism Queensland. 'There's a rocky pathway going down hill towards the cave and I took a photograph of the pool and the waterfall stream that lands on a broken log,' he said. 'It captures the atmosphere of the location.' Skyscape: Cloud starts creeping over the city at Brisbane's South Bank while 20-year-old Alex poses with a bird for a very rare selfie .

An image of a Natural Bridge near Queensland's Gold Coast (right) caught the attention of Tourism Queensland. Close up of  a penguin who became Alex's 'best friend' at Sea Life Melbourne and a study of an ant perched on a luscious green leaf . Now that Korica has sharpened his skills, he has decided to take a step back from Instagram to pursue photography more seriously. 'I would just like to keep it as a passion, I don’t want to lose that passion,' he said. 'I would like to work with Tourism Australia and keep sharing photos with my family, friends and the audience.' Many images feature the pink and gold drenched skies of Queensland at sunrise and sunset (left) while others make use of reflections on water . A close up of a some clowns' heads (left) and a leaf flushed with autumn colours which fell to the ground about two months ago. 'I love autumn', Alex wrote with this post. 'I have a bushwalk that I run through locally, and it's always a comfort to my eyes seeing fallen leaves of all colours on the ground' This picture of a windsurfer (left) illuminated by a flash of sunlight was taken off the coast of Queensland while this night-time image was created using steelwool .

"By . Sarah Dean . A former police officer, previously awarded the Cross of Valour for bravery, has risked his life again by jumping onto train tracks at Sydney's Redfern station to save a man who'd tumbled into the path of a train. In shocking CCTV footage from the platform, Allan Sparkes, 56, can be seen dashing to the rescue of another man who had fallen onto the tracks just seconds before a train rolled into the busy station. 'If nobody had gone down and got that chap off the platform, the train would have hit him and killed him,' said a calm Mr Sparkes. Scroll down for video . Hero: Former police officer Allan Sparkes didn't think twice about jumping down onto the tracks at Redfern station in Sydney to save another man . More commuters rushed to help pull them both to safety just in time, when the incident occured on Sunday, April 27. 'I looked over and saw the chap inside there and that's when I decided to get down as quick as I could,' he explained to Nine News. Sydney Trains directions of operations, Tony Eid, said: 'We recognise the bravery of the gentleman who jumped down and saved this guy's life.' One the edge: An unidentified man wobbled on the platform before falling onto the track . Dangerous: Mr Sparkes put his life at risk by going down to the train tracks . Rescuers: Allan Sparkes was helped by other commuters as he jumped down to save the man from imminent danger . Just in time: A woman in a pink outfit helped drag the two men back onto the platform at Redfern . It's not the first time Mr Sparkes,who lives in Sydney's inner west, has been hailed a hero. He was awarded the Cross of Valour for bravery after rescuing an 11-year-old boy in Coffs Harbour. On May 3, 1996, the then-officer with New South Wales Police was called to rescue a boy trapped in a flooded underground storm water drain following record rainfalls at Coffs Harbour. Mr Sparkes tied a rope around himself and entered the drain, where he was washed 20 metres along the pipe by the ferocious current. After the first attempt failed he tried again and says he almost drowned as he was washed 80 metres away from where he entered. But after a desperate search he finally made contact with the boy 30 metres from the pipe opening, coaxing him to let go of the debris he was clinging to so that he could be saved. 'I thought ""you better hurry up and get out of here quick smart"",' he joked at the time. Lucky escape: Less than a minute later a train rolled in to the platform . No regrets: The former police officer suggested he would do it again if someone needed his help . Mr Sparkes now works as a motivational speaker. He left the police force after 20 years as a frontline officer due to the cumulative effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic depression. He went on to write a book called The Cost of Bravery, which revealed how that first rescue sparked a downward spiral for his mental health. But Mr Sparkes had no doubts about rescuing the man on the train tracks this week. Decorated hero: Mr Sparkes starred in a 60 Minutes documentary after he was first awarded the Cross of Valour in 1998 .

Eric Brisley, 85, whose home overlooks North Sands beach in scenic Salcombe, Devon, couldn’t believe it when Lloyds told him it was too risky to insure his home. The retired ICI worker said it would be impossible for his home to flood because of its height and distance of 750ft from the sea. Eric Brisley has been denied home insurance because of a flood risk despite living 250ft above sea on a hillside . But the company which assesses risk on a postcode basis said all houses in his postcode are a flood risk and has placed a blanket ban on insuring them. Mr Brisley, a grandfather of three has lived at the house for 30 years and is already insured with another firm. But after an unrelated appointment at Lloyds Bank in Kingsbridge, he was offered a quote for insurance on his home. He said: 'I was quite happy with my present insurer but the assistant said she thought she could do better. 'She put in my particulars into the computer and began to look very worried. 'And went off to make a phone call. Eric Brisley couldn¿t believe it when Lloyds told him it was too risky to insure his home .

The retired ICI worker said it would be impossible for his home to flood because of its height and distance of 750ft from the sea . 'When she came back she said there was something wrong with the system and would phone me when she had sorted it out. 'But she phoned me to say unfortunately as my house was liable to flooding she couldn’t insure me. 'I was absolutely astonished because I live 250ft above sea level and 750ft from the water - it’s quite ridiculous.

Postcode lottery: Mr Brisley, a grandfather of three, has lived at the house for 30 years . 'There’s no possibility of getting flooded either from streams or from the sea. 'I don’t think even the biggest tsunami would affect us up here. 'Most of England would be flooded before I get flooded.' Despite sending letters and maps indicating his home was unlikely to flood, Lloyds and its underwriters would still not give him insurance. Mr Brisley is worried the refusal by Lloyds could affect his future premiums as he will now have to declare he was denied insurance. Concerns: Mr Brisley is worried the refusal by Lloyds could affect his future premiums . Kimberly Hamilton, media relations manager at Lloyds Bank, said: 'This particular postcode is coastal and on a very significant slope, part of which is high flood risk, hence why we decline to underwrite in that area.' However, Mr Brisley said: 'The whole post code area TQ8 8JP has never been flooded. 'The system of assessment, which Lloyds use is seriously flawed. 'There is nothing unusual or unique about our situation and so it follows that there are likely to be many thousands of homes around our coasts which are incorrectly being denied cover. Ms Hamilton added: 'Unfortunately, at present, our systems are only able to underwrite at a postcode level, which occasionally can mean situations such as Mr Brisley’s arise. 'However, we are currently working towards a system that will allow us to underwrite based on an individual house level, which will prevent these issues from arising.'","Eric Brisley, 85, has lived in his home for 30 years .

"By . Kate Lyons . University could become accessible only to the very rich with middle-class students unable to afford fees if the federal government's proposed cuts to higher education funding go ahead, warned the University of Sydney's Vice Chancellor. Dr Michael Spence spoke out as thousands of people took to the street across the nation yesterday, protesting the cuts. He said a national conversation needed to take place to make sure that entry to university still depended on merit and not wealth. Scroll down for video . Vice Chancellor Michael Spence has spoken out about the cuts to higher education proposed by Tony Abbott last week saying that they may lead to a class war at universities, with middle-class students no longer able to afford education . National Day of Action: Thousands of student protesters took to the streets in cities across the country yesterday to protest cuts to federal government spending on higher education . Police scuffled with protesters in Sydney's CBD as they protested the Abbott government's budget cuts . 'I want the best students, not only those who can afford to pay,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Dr Spence is a supporter of uncapped fee deregulation, but thinks deregulation should be modelled on overseas universities, which have enormous fees, but where entry is dependent on academic merit. He said that universities such as Harvard allow people of different socio-economic backgrounds to attend because they have varying levels of scholarship support available, with wealthier students paying higher fees. 'I don't think social justice requires everyone to pay the same fee [if fees are deregulated]. In fact it requires people to pay different amounts depending on their ability to pay. 'But I think you have to be careful that you don't create a trap where aspirational Australians, not just disadvantaged Australians, will be kept out,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Deanna Taylor, president of the National Union of Students, told MailOnline that Dr Spence's plan was 'a way of covertly making fee deregulation appear less harmful than it actually is.' 'Fee deregulation, no matter how you roll the dice, will lead to massive fee increases... We can’t rely on scholarships, the government should be at the forefront of easing the debt burden for students,' she said. 'We view education in the same way as we view universal healthcare – it should be universal, it should be open to everyone. Whether they’re wealthy, poor, everyone should be able to access it.' Students are protesting the deregulation of university fees, which they argue could make popular courses at the best universities available to the rich, rather than to the deserving . Two people were arrested in Sydney yesterday after thousands of people took to Sydney's streets to protest the cuts . Nabbed: A student protesting cuts to the education budget is moved on by police in the Sydney CBD . Under the proposed changes, government funding for each Commonwealth-supported student would be cut by about 20 percent and universities will be free to decide their own fees for undergraduates courses. Dr Spence emailed staff and students about the changes on Wednesday, informing them that The University of Sydney senate is yet to decide its final position on the issue. There has been confusion about who will be affected by the cuts, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott said during a radio interview that only students who begin university in 2016 will be affected by the deregulation. 'If you start a course under one system you will finish it under one system. If you start next year your conditions of study won't change. It's only for those who start whne these changes kick in in 2016 that will have the different conditions applying to them,' Mr Abbott told ABC radio. This claim was contradicted by a Department of Education spokesman who said: 'Students who enrol in a Commonwealth-supported place after 13 May 2014 will be charged under the existing arrangements until 31 December 2015. After this date they will be charged under the new arrangements.' This means that thousands of school leavers hoping to start university in 2015 could be forced to select a course without knowing what fees they will be forced to pay under the deregulated system from 2016. This protester was arrested by riot squad police as he marched through Sydney streets protesting budget cuts to higher education . Surrounded: Young protesters blocked trams from operating in Melbourne . Mr Spence spoke out on Wednesday as police clashed with thousands of students protesting the Abbott government's changes to tertiary education funding announced in the recent federal budget. A massive contingent of police officers struggled to contain the masses as they chanted slogans including 'bull****, come off it, our education is not for profit,' reported The Age. Melbourne saw the most tense conflict, however demonstrations in Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane also exploded in violence and chaos. Victorian police arrested 13 people in Melbourne who will receive court summons 'in due course' for offences relating to obstructing roadways and footpaths. NSW police confirmed at least two arrests were made in Sydney, with a 20-year-old man remaining in police custody and likely to be charged for allegedly lighting a flare. The protests caused traffic chaos for commuters around the country, with the Melbourne CBD all but shut down and a northbound lane closed on Sydney's George Street at peak hour.

The 61-year-old father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He appeared at Burwood Local Court via video link on Wednesday and has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Scroll down for video . Escorted to court: A 26-year-old, pictured, faced Burwood Local Court on Wednesday after illegally marrying a girl who was 12 years old at the time of marriage in January . Cannot be identified: Since the illegal marriage, the 26-year-old man and the girl have engaged in sexual activities daily, as stated in court documents . The 26-year-old Lebanese man has since had his student visa cancelled and is in immigration detention after being charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 years. Escorted by guards contracted by the immigration department, the man also appeared at Burwood Local Court on Wednesday. Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 26-year-old University of Newcastle student at a mosque in November last year after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The father gave the girl sexual advice about contraception on the day of the wedding, according to court papers filed by police in support of an AVO application against the girl's father, The Daily Telegraph reported. 'The advice was that she should not use the contraceptive pill nor should (her husband) wear a condom when they have sexual intercourse,' the papers said. It is alleged they were married in an Islamic ceremony in the living room in January this year. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. Cases adjourned: After appearing in court on Wednesday, both men had their cases adjourned until June, when they are expected to make a plea . A week after the wedding, he asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. He also asked the girl, now aged 13, if she needed to shower before morning prayer on one occasion, court documents show. 'The (girl) indicated that this is how the defendant would have known that (they) were engaged in sexual intercourse,' the papers claim. Islam requires people to shower after sex before they commence prayer, the girl allegedly told police. The imam who performed the ceremony, Muhammad Riaz Tasawar, plead guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500 after. Court documents state that since the marriage the pair have engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the 26-year-old,' the police report states. Both men had their cases adjourned until June 18, where they are expected to make a plea.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tireless: Doreen Lawrence . The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence was honoured for her relentless pursuit of justice and her campaign against  racism yesterday. Doreen Lawrence was presented with the Londoner of the Year Award by the Daily Mail’s Editor, Paul Dacre, at the London Press Club Awards. Stephen was 18 when he was stabbed to death by five white youths at a bus stop in Eltham, South East London, in 1993. Baroness Lawrence fought tirelessly for justice for her son and, in January 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were finally convicted of the murder. At the awards, the London Evening Standard won Daily Newspaper of the Year and The Mail on Sunday won Sunday Newspaper of the Year. One of the special honours of the day, the John Lewis-sponsored Edgar Wallace award for writing of the highest quality, went to Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday contributor Ian Birrell.The Daily Mail was praised by judges for its ‘constantly expanding roster of star  columnists’, a history of  ‘successful campaigning’ and its ‘juggernaut website’. At the awards, held at The Stationers and Newspaper Makers’ Hall, in central London, Mr Dacre said: ‘It is bitter sweet that the recipient of this award needs no introduction. ‘Who has not heard of Doreen Lawrence and her fight for justice for her son Stephen – brutally and senselessly murdered in a case that brought shame on  London for more than 20 years. ‘I and the Mail team are proud of our own efforts to help achieve justice for Stephen. Two of the thugs are in jail and the case remains open in relation to others. But throughout that battle Doreen Lawrence has fought for the other Stephens as she calls them.’ Mr Dacre said Lady Lawrence had ‘become a powerful champion against racism’ and been ‘justly recognised’ last year with a seat in the House of Lords. Baroness Lawrence said it was ‘a privilege’ to accept the award. She thanked the Press for their support over the years, singling out the Daily Mail, which famously published a front page on February 14, 1997, branding five suspects as ‘Murderers’. She said: ‘I think that without having the Mail publish their faces, no one would know. They could walk around and nobody knew what they looked like.’ The other winners were: Scoop of the Year – Sunday People for Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi; Blog of the Year – Paul Staines of Guido Fawkes; Arts Reviewer of the Year – Ludovic Hunter-Tilney (Financial Times); Business Journalist of the Year – Simon Neville (Independent and Evening Standard); Broadcast Journalist of the Year – LBC Breakfast host Nick Ferrari.",Doreen Lawrence presented with Londoner of the Year Award .
"By . Mark Duell . Mother of two: Nikki Herbison died after collapsing while taking part in a 5k fun-run for charity . A mother of two collapsed and died on the hottest day of the year while taking part in a  Parkrun. Nikki Herbison is believed to have suffered a brain haemorrhage while running to raise money for charity at her local park on Saturday morning. The 39-year-old, a keen runner, was tackling her third Parkrun – volunteer-organised 5km events that take place every week at hundreds of locations across the country. The free-to-enter challenges allow any standard of runner to try to beat their previous best time and can be used to raise money for charities. Temperatures soared to 24C (75F) as Mrs Herbison took part in the event at Rushcliffe Country Park in Ruddington, Nottingham, near her family home. After collapsing less than halfway round, she was taken to the Queen’s Medical Centre but died the following afternoon. Her husband Adrian and their two sons, aged two and five, were at the run to offer moral support. ‘I am devastated,’ he said. ‘The whole family have been very supportive and we are just trying to make sure the boys are OK at the moment. ‘We just want them to remember their mum and that she loved them so much.’ Scene: Mrs Herbison was competing in the Rushcliffe Parkrun at Rushcliffe Country Park (file picture) near Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, when she collapsed halfway round the course . Mr Herbison, 43, who is known to . friends as Ade, said yesterday that he was told a woman had collapsed . and knew it was his wife of nine years from the description he was . given. ‘She was really . looking forward to running the race,’ he said. ‘Luckily, people behind . her were doctors – they stopped running to help her. I cannot praise . them enough and there couldn’t have been a better response.’ She . is the second Parkrunner to die in as many months. In March Steve . Worland, 58, a cycling journalist, suffered a heart attack at a Parkrun . in Bristol. Mrs Herbison was . chairman of the St Mary’s Community Park Project and had recently set . up a donations web page and was working on funding applications. Hospital: She died at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham (pictured) on Sunday, with her husband by her side . Her . last two posts on Facebook were about raising money for the park and a . second project to attract donations to the Children’s Brain Tumour . Research Centre at the University of Nottingham. 'We are just trying to make sure the boys are okay at the moment. We just want them to remember their mum and that she loved them so much' Adrian Herbison . Friend . Kate Coppinger, of Nottingham, wrote on Facebook: ‘I’ve been thinking . and praying for her and her family such a lot over the past few days. It . is so sad and an absolutely tragic loss.’ A statement from St Mary’s . Community Park Project read: ‘It is with deep sadness that we inform you . of the sudden and unexpected passing of our dear friend and chair of St . Mary’s Community Park Project, Nikki Herbison. ‘Nikki brought huge enthusiasm and drive to the project and her sheer determination has got the project to where we are today.’ Well-wishers have suggested that a memorial be created at the park as a tribute to Nikki. Mr . Herbison added: ‘A memorial would be lovely and I would be really . touched if that happened. I knew Nikki was great but I didn’t realise . how well thought of she was. It does make me feel a bit better.’ Results of a post-mortem examination are expected within the next  few days. Parkruns are 5km events that take place every Saturday morning at hundreds of venues across the country. They began in 2004 and there are now at least 246 Parkrun clubs in the UK, some attended by more than 400 people every week. The timed runs attract entrants of all abilities, and every runner’s time is posted online. Participants can then check their time and see what place they have come in the ‘race’. Parkruns now take place in ten countries and there are more than 760,000 registered Parkrunners.","Nikki Herbison was competing in Rushcliffe Parkrun in Nottinghamshire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This is the second time that Joe Longthorne, pictured, has battled against cancer . Singer and impressionist Joe Longthorne yesterday revealed he is battling throat cancer. The 58-year old, who beat leukaemia in 2006, will have surgery in the next few days and vowed: ‘I’ve been here before, so here we go, round two coming up.’ Longthorne’s battle against illness began in 1989 when he was diagnosed with lymphoma. It developed into leukaemia but he won his fight against the disease after he had a bone marrow transplant in 2006. But this year he found a lump in his throat and surgeons will operate after the weekend. Longthorne, who was awarded an MBE for services to charity in 2012, vowed to carry on his UK tour while he could and said his Catholic faith would help him beat the illness again. In a statement the Blackpool-based star said: 'I was completely and utterly shocked at being given the news about having to have treatment for throat cancer. However, I am 100 per cent positive. 'I've been here before, so here we go, round two coming up. You have two choices on being given news like this, you can stay down or get up and fight. 'I've always chosen to fight and fight on I will. I've beaten it before and will do so again. 'There are always people much worse of than yourself so it's important to keep focused at this time. 'I have the most wonderful family one could ever have, some very dear friends and the best fans anyone could ever wish for. I have had their love and total support all through my life and they have and always will be there for me.' He said: 'I would like to say to my fans at this time to think of my charities and give their support if they can. 'After receiving the MBE in 2012 I have given much more time and attention to helping others and I would like to ask my fans to do this too and they will be helping me on the way. We are like one big family these days as I like it. 'Obviously with being a vocalist I am taking each day one day at a time and will remain positive and resolute about the outcome, I am a Catholic and have my faith and deep belief in Jesus Christ, he has seen me through before and he will be there for me this time.' Joe Longthorne, pictured at the height of his fame, said that his Catholic faith will help him defeat cancer for a second time .","Joe Longthorne faces immanent surgery after discovering a lump in his throat .
