"Michael Sam has joined the Dallas Cowboys and the star told MailOnline: ‘I’m excited to be a Cowboy, it’s great to be heading home.’ The defensive end - the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL – jetted in to Texas Tuesday night ahead of a physical today. Sam joins the Cowboys practice squad just days after being sensationally dropped by the St Louis Rams. The Cowboys - nicknamed America's Team - said he will compete for a spot as a defensive end on the team. Sam joined the squad for practice this afternoon, under the watchful eye of head coach Jason Garrett. Scroll down for video . Michael Sam was photographed on Tuesday night as he landed in Dallas ahead of a physical with the Cowboys on Wednesday . New opportunity: Michael Sam joined the Dallas Cowboys in practice today after being signed to the practice squad as a defensive end . In a press conference today, Garrett said: 'We feel like he has a chance to come in at a position we’ve tried to address really throughout the offseason, throughout training camp, and compete for a spot... We just want to give him a chance to come in and see if he can help our football team.' When the Rams announced their final pick for the 2014 season, Sam’s name wasn't on the roster, despite having an impressive pre-season. And his shock departure sparked claims the gay star was dropped due to the unwanted attention surrounding his sexuality. But today, in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, upbeat Sam shrugged off any controversy. He said: ‘None of that matters, I’m excited to be to be joining Dallas, I just want to play football, it's great to be heading back to my home state. 'It's been a roller coaster this past week but I'm happy where I'm at now. ‘I'm just looking forward to being a Cowboy, my focus is on making the team.’ Despite claims that his departure from the Rams was due to unwanted attention surrounding his sexuality, Sam told MailOnline that he just wants to play football and happy to be back in his home state . Michael Sam suited up for the Dallas Cowboys today after the team picked him for its practice squad and a shot to play on game day . Michael Sam's talents as a defensive end could be put to use on the Cowboys, who are  by some accounts 'desperate' for players in his position . Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett says he thinks Sam could compete for a spot on the team. The Cowboys signed Sam to the practice squad on Tuesday . Initially there were fears that no team in the NFL would pick Sam up but the 24-year-old’s dreams are back on track. The laid back star said he hasn't even had the chance to speak with his family in Texas about the dream move. ‘It has all happened so quickly, but it's exciting, I just wanna get back to playing football you know. 'I haven't had chance to speak to any of my family yet, not even my mom, but I will. 'I never followed the Cowboys growing up because I never had a team. I am a fan of defenses and Dallas need some help, that's why I'm going.' The former Missouri College star said he’s now come full-circle. Dressed in casual sports gear Sam was in a relaxed mood as he waited to board the American Airlines flight to Dallas-Fort Worth and even took time to chat with Cowboys fans who recognized him . The St Louis Rams first announced on Saturday that defensive end Michael Sam  had been cut from the team . ‘It’s funny, Missouri is where my college career ended and now I’m heading back home to Texas where hopefully my NFL career will start,’ he said. Sam said his boyfriend Vito Cammisano is staying behind for this trip. 'Vito is staying in St Louis for now, I don't know how long this trip is gonna be,’ he said. Travelling alone, few recognized the imposing football player hidden under a baseball cap as he walked through St Louis International Airport. Dressed in casual sports gear he was in a relaxed mood as he waited to board the American Airlines flight to Dallas-Fort Worth. The star even took time to chat with Cowboys fans who were traveling back home and recognized him. Sam, who came out in the months leading up to the draft, celebrated with his boyfriend Vito Cammisano on live television after he was picked for the St Louis Rams . Michael Sam posted this message on Twitter on Saturday after he was dropped by the St Louis Rams roster for the 2014 season . Sam, who one day dreams of earning the big bucks many NFL superstars enjoy, had to settle for economy class on this trip. It's been a rough road for Sam. After being dropped by the Rams Sam posted an upbeat message to his Twitter account on Saturday despite his obstacles. 'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues.' His boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, also showed his support for Sam by tweeted a picture of the couple together, wearing shirts from the University of Missouri, where they both attended college. Sam had garnered a lot of media attention (pictured on July 29 at a Rams training camp) after he became the first openly gay player to be drafted . Sam’s shock departure from the Rams had had some people inside the sport questioning if his sexual orientation was simply too much of a distraction. Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Eric Wood said the media was too blame for focusing on the personal life of the NFL's first openly gay draft pick. 'Blame that on espn,' Wood tweeted on Tuesday. 'No one wants the distraction.' Wood's comment came after sports commentator Ross Tucker had publicly wondered on Twitter why 'Michael Sam performed much better than most expected and still isn't even on a practice squad?'","Head coach Jason Garrett confirmed Sam's spot on the practice squad .

"It is a country which has been left on its knees, fuelling anger and resentment among its people. Almost nobody in Greece has been left untouched by the devastating economic crisis.

Much . of the violence went unreported because victims were afraid of . deportation if they went to the police, who were sometimes involved in . the attacks, Francois Crepeau said. A . major gateway for Asian and African immigrants trying to enter Europe . through its porous borders, Greece has long struggled with illegal . immigration.

Many often find . shocking conditions at detention centres with food shortages, no hot . water or heating and open hostility from Greeks embittered by years of . austerity, Crepeau and other rights groups say. Egyptian immigrant Waleed Taleb is another victim. He says demanding his unpaid wages in Greece came at a heavy price; 18 hours chained and beaten by his boss, a stint in jail and orders to leave the country he calls home. Shocking: The economic crisis has seen riots on the streets of Greece. In this picture, a riot policeman is on fire from a petrol bomb thrown by protesters . One of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who toil in Greece's black labour market, Taleb had just finished cleaning the bakery where he worked one November morning on the island of Salamina when he sparked his boss's fury. The baker and two others fastened an 8-metre long metal chain around Taleb's neck with a lock and dragged him to a stable, he said, where another man joined them. There they tied him to a chair, tightened the noose and punched him while he drifted in and out of consciousness, he said. The men drank beer - which they also forced into Taleb's mouth - and taunted him for being a Muslim, he said. 'They dragged me around like a dog,' said Taleb, recounting the attack from a mattress on the floor of his dingy apartment tucked away amid Salamina's low-roofed houses and tavernas. 'I thought this was the end for me. I kept fainting, and every time I fainted they would hit me with rods to wake me up.' After 18 hours, Taleb managed to escape when his captors left to reopen the bakery. But his nightmare was not over. Found at dawn under a tree with the heavy chain still around his neck and his face swollen beyond recognition, Taleb was initially taken to a hospital and given first aid. But police later whisked him away to detain him on the charge that he lacked documents to live in Greece - though he says he complained he could barely walk and was in pain. Fighting: Protestors clash with riot police during an anti-austerity protest . 'Everyone could see I was suffering. I couldn't even see, and I couldn't eat,' says Taleb, 29. A month later he has a neck brace, an arm bandage and can only eat semi-solid food. 'I thought I would die. The problem wasn't that I didn't have papers; the problem was that I had been beaten.' Calling his ordeal one of 'striking brutality', the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said his case followed a pattern in which migrants are 'immediately arrested with the view to be deported' when they go to police to report an attack. After an outcry over the case - including condemnation by the Egyptian embassy and a protest by other Egyptians - Greece's public order minister on Tuesday said Taleb would not be deported due to 'humanitarian reasons'. But rights groups said it was not clear how long he would be allowed to stay. Taleb says he spent four days in two detention centres and was given documents telling him to leave Greece in 30 days, while his boss was released after three days pending trial. The baker, a former deputy mayor in Salamina, admitted to beating Taleb - but not brutally - and accuses him of stealing 13,000 euros that Taleb says is his money, police said. The other men Taleb accused were charged but are free pending trial since police failed to arrest them in the required 24-hour window after the crime. 'There was a phone in prison, and when I called other people, they told me my boss had already been released,' he said. 'They hit me, robbed me and then everyone was out of jail except me.' Indeed, the lack of any convictions in Greece over racist attacks has allowed migrants to be targeted with impunity, said Nikitas Kanakis, head of Doctors of the World in Greece. 'The state should apologise to a man found under a tree in chains. We treated him like a dog - that's bad enough,' Kanakis said, attacking the move to detain Taleb after his ordeal. 'If we don't convict any of these people nothing will change. Then everyone feels that they can get away with it.' Police officials defended their actions by saying Taleb was pulled out of hospital only after they were given the go-ahead by doctors and that Greek law required the detention of illegal immigrants. A Greek police spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement by the minister saying Taleb's deportation had been suspended. Taleb and others in the Egyptian community say his injuries were serious enough for him to be sent back to hospital for a week after his four days in detention were over. Two Greek immigration lawyers said Taleb was lucky to be given 30 days to leave - many others are often given just seven days to get out of Greece. Greek . officials say the root of the problem with the country's migrants is the so-called Dublin II . treaty, which deems asylum seekers to be the responsibility of the . country where they entered Europe and thus puts a heavier burden on . border states like Greece. Greek . governments have repeatedly asked for the treaty to be repealed, to no . avail, and the U.N.'s Crepeau also said Europe needed to do more to help . Greece with the flow of migrants.","Many face daily racist attacks, police apathy and a .

"A Virginia mom is facing a social media backlash for hitting out at a restaurant that kicked her out for drinking alcohol while breastfeeding. Crystal McCullough was refused service from the Big Woody's Bar and Grill in Chesapeake on Labor Day because she was nursing her 11-month-old baby with a beer and shot of whiskey in front of her. McCullough - who says she has a degree in chemistry - told the wait staff the drinks were for after she was finished, that she had only had one sip of beer before breastfeeding and was well within her rights to be doing so. After the restaurant asked her to leave, McCullough took to Facebook to vent her anger, opening the feedback floodgates for people to both commend and blast her. 'That treatment was wrong,' McCullough told News Channel 3. Controversial: Crystal McCullough says she was within her rights to sip a beer while breastfeeding her 11-month-old daughter at a bar on Labor Day, however staff asked to leave . Facebook floodgates: After venting her anger on social media, McCullough was hit back with a variety of responses, many of them blasting her, but more supporting the rights of women who breastfeed . Scene: McCullough was celebrating Labor Day with her family at Big Woody's Bar and Grill in Chesapeake when the incident occurred . Standing his ground: Big Woody's co-owner Jeff Leeroy said the issue was not with breastfeeding, but that other patrons were uncomfortable seeing McCullough drink while doing so . 'I had a huge water I was downing. I had a beer and a shot of Fireball in front of me but that was for after I was done.' 'And I had one sip of beer and I’m not planning on the rest until after I’m done nursing.' Restaurant co-owner Jeff Leeroy said the staff issue was not over McCullough breastfeeding, but the reaction of other patrons to her drinking while doing so. 'Women have breastfed in here numerous times with no issues whatsoever,' Leeroy said. 'It was about the drinks being in front of her and people seeing that she had partaken in the drink. 'It’s not easy to go and talk to someone and say you’re breastfeeding but you’re drinking too.' Alot of the comments McCullough received supported her stance, saying that women have a right to breasfeed. However other branded her a bad mom who should have left her daughter at time if she wanted to drink. Backlash: Crystal McCullough, a chemist, said she would never endanger her daughter and had done her research about consuming alcohol while nursing . There is no medical consensus on whether women should or should not drink while breastfeeding. While the Mayo Clinic is against doing so, the American Academy of Pediatrics has approved the use of alcohol in breastfeeding mothers. 'Alcohol does pass into breast milk more readily that other drugs, but unless you drink several drinks or more a day, every day, then there should be no problem,' the Academy said, according to News Channel 3. As a chemist, McCullough said she is well aware of her limits while breastfeeding and would never endanger her child. She wants an apology from Big Woody's for the incident.","Crystal McCullough was breastfeeding her daughter at Big Woody's Bar and Grill in Chesapeake, Virginia, on Labor Day .

"Dreams of airships that float through the skies have been largely confined to the scrap heap in recent times. But now a Chinese engineer obsessed with the idea of reinventing the airship has unveiled an 'indestructible' inflatable plane that can be folded up and put in a suitcase when not needed. He says his plane could be used for a variety of missions and, what's more, it won't break if it falls out of the sky. Scroll down for video . Chinese engineer obsessed with the idea of reinventing the airship has unveiled an 'indestructible' inflatable plane that can be folded up and put in a suitcase when not needed. Pictured is the Chinese engineer Zhang Bingyan showing his design at the Tianjin International UAV Exhibition . Zhang Bingyan, 69, started working on his designs as an engineer with the Henan Normal University in Xinxiang, China in 1993. He has now unveiled the results of more than 20 years of research in creating a 'soft body aeroplane' at the Tianjin International UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Exhibition. His designs, looking a bit like an inflatable lilo, have nothing inside them but air. A human-like ‘skin’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘feel’ the world around them - is being developed by British experts. Engineers at BAE Systems’ Advanced Technology Centre are investigating a ‘smart skin’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors. When applied to an aircraft, it will enable it to sense wind speed, temperature, physical strain and movement, far more accurately than current sensor technology allows. The revolutionary ‘smart skin’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health, reporting back on potential problems before they become significant. The plane, called the Sf-1, has an average speed of 120 miles (120km) per hour and can fly up to 3,000 metres (10,000ft) with a maximum load of 25 kg (55lbs). Aside from the engine that powers a rear-mounted propeller and wheels at the bottom the entire vehicle is made of a rubber composite and a high-strength fibre material. The flexibility of the plane also means that, even if it falls from the sky, it will likely survive an impact with the ground. It costs between £20,000 and £30,000 ($32,400 and $48,600) to make. One of the designs was able to reach spectacular speeds of up to 120 miles (190km) per hour, weighing 90kg (200lbs) with a six-metre (20ft) wingspan. 'I developed a special high-strength fibre material which has a tensile strength of 10 to 15 times that of steel,' he said. 'No matter what happens, the aircraft will not be damaged in a collision under any circumstances and that's the best way to protect human life.' The plane can reach spectacular speeds of up to 120 miles (190 km) per hour, with one of his designs weighing just 90 kg (200 lbs) and with a six-metre (20 ft) wingspan. 'I developed a special high-strength fibre material which has a tensile strength of 10 to 15 times that of steel,' Bingyan said. Pictured here is the engine of the inflatable plane created by Chinese engineer Zhang Bingyan . Zhang Bingyan graduated from Beijing Institute of Technology in the 1960s and was later assigned to the Chinese Commission of Science and Technology and Industry for National Defence to be engaged in engine research. His latest design, which is the culmination of all of his work so far, is effectively an inflatable aircraft that because of its lightweight design, compared with a normal aircraft, has a big load capacity. It also has good flexibility and, as with his earlier designs, high impact resistance. He said it can be used for low speed and low altitude navigation, aerial surveys and remote sensing. The plane, called the Sf-1, has an average speed of 12 miles (20 km) per hour and can fly up to 3,000 metres (10,000 ft) with a maximum load of 25 kg (55 lbs) The flexibility of the plane also means that if it falls from the sky it will likely survive the impact with the ground .","Chinese engineer Zhang Bingyan has unveiled his novel plane design .

"Japanese space scientists have unveiled the asteroid hunting space probe they hope to launch later this year on a mission to mine a celestial body. The probe, named Hayabusa-2, is expected to be flung into space in December on a four year voyage to the asteroid 1999JU3. When it gets there, some time in 2018, it will release a powerful cannon which will fire a metal bullet at the asteroid's barren crust, once the probe itself has scuttled to safety on the far side of the rock. Scroll down for video . The probe, named Hayabusa-2 (artist's impression pictured), is expected to be flung into space on a rocket for a four year voyage to the asteroid 1999JU3 . It will then return to scoop up material uncovered by the cannon blast. If all goes well, these pristine asteroid samples will be returned to Earth by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games in 2020. At a weekend press conference, Hitoshi Kuninaka, project leader at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) said he and his team were readying to redouble their efforts for this 'new voyage'. 'I'm grateful as the new asteroid probe is now nearly complete,' he said, according to Jiji Press. The probe is the successor to Jaxa's first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa - the Japanese term for falcon - which returned to Earth in 2010 with dust samples after a trouble-plagued seven-year mission. The spherical 1999JU3 asteroid, which is around a half a mile (1km) across, contains significantly more organic matter and water than the potato-shaped rock previously studied by the original Hayabusa. Once it arrives at the asteroid in 2018, Hayabusa 2 will observe the entire surface of the asteroid using a variety of remote-sensing instruments . Hayabusa means falcon in Japanese. Hayabusa 2 is a successor to JAXA's earlier asteroid explorer Hayabusa, which returned the first asteroid samples to Earth in June 2010. Hayabusa 2 is the third mission to land on an asteroid. Nasa's NEAR-Shoemaker mission was the first mission to touchdown on an asteroid.Hayabusa 2 is the second asteroid sample-return mission . Analysing this valuable cosmic material could shed light on the mysteries surrounding the solar system and its origins 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists at Jaxa say Hayabusa-2 will build on the work of its predecessor, which was only able to collect surface dust samples that could have been altered by years of exposure to various forms of energy encountered in space. Despite various setbacks during its epic seven-year journey, including intermittent loss of communication and damage to its motors, the first Hayabasa was hailed as a triumph of science when it returned to Earth. Jaxa's work guiding the craft back to terra firma made it a source of pride for Japan, even inspiring several Japanese feature films. The asteroid is currently scheduled to be blasted in 2018 and the probe will make its back to Earth by the end of the decade. The data could shed light on how planets form and life arises . Kuninaka said there were a number of possible complications and pitfalls that could await Hayabusa-2. 'Of course, I hope things will go smoothly,' said Mr Kuninaka. 'We have had many difficulties in the process of developing the new asteroid probe. Space is never an easy place,' he said. Asteroids are believed to retain materials unchanged from the solar system's earliest days, unlike scorched remains such as meteorites or materials on Earth which have been transformed through pressure and heat. The 1999JU3 asteroid was selected in part because of its make-up and also because of its relative accessibility. The space cannon will detach and remotely fire a 4lb metal projectile into the surface of the miniature planet .","Hayabusa-2 will be flung into space on a rocket for a four year voyage .

'To facing my family and friends with only a conceptual husband, who can't leave the banks of his river home. Trying to figure out how – and indeed if - I can fit back into Australian culture, or if I will find my place in this country again. 'Sadly our marriage certificate was not enough to convince the authorities to allow me to stay in France as his partner.' The artist also reflected on fond memories shared with her significant other, whose name is translated to mean The Devil's Bridge, since their wedding day on June 17 when they married in front 14 guests. Ms Rose met her husband after spending a decade traveling the world recording the vibrations in bridge cables with contact microphones and using them to create experimental music . She revealed she has struggled since the French government refused to grant her a visa and failed to recognise her marriage to the historic bridge . 'I would love to be with him now. Eating those amazing plump cherries from the orchards around Ceret... and drinking the fabulous Le Maudit (The Devil) red wine from Domaine Treloar, family vineyard in Roussillon as we watch the sun set together,' she wrote. 'The wedding truly was a spectacular celebration and I feel like our journey is still just beginning. 'We both have a lot of growing and discovery to do, both on our own and on our shared path...this time apart has certainly helped our love grow stronger. 'I have forsaken all other bridges, and will be ecstatically reunited with my sexy French devil soon.' 'I have forsaken all other bridges, and will be ecstatically reunited with my sexy French devil soon,' she told the Daily Mail Australia . Despite their union not being legally recognised in Australia or France, Ms Rose hopes to be able to head back to visit her husband before their second anniversary. 'His vibrations are calling me back to Europe and I look forward to being reunited with my bridge love in the French Pyrenees,' she said. 'I think that our story has a lot more to unfold, and there is definitely the possibility of baby bridges along the way.'

"Mauricio Pochettino was in Milton Keynes to witness Manchester United’s embarrassing defeat, which offered him a timely insight into the perils of games you are expected to win and a close-up look at Danny Welbeck. Tottenham are among several clubs interested in signing the England striker, who wants regular football away from Old Trafford. Pochettino, who clinched the signing of Federico Fazio for £8million from Sevilla on Thursday night, is also keen on Jay Rodriguez but the Southampton striker will not be fit until January and relations between the clubs were soured by a failed swoop for Morgan Schneiderlin. VIDEO Scroll down for Mauricio Pochettino dismisses rumours of Soldado leaving . Done deal: Tottenham have completed the signing of Sevilla defender Federico Fazio in an £8million deal . New boy: Fazio poses at Tottenham's training ground have signed a four-year deal with the club . However, the idea of Welbeck appeals to others at Tottenham, especially on loan. Spurs boss Pochettino confessed United’s 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat to MK Dons was a handy reminder ahead of tonight’s Europa League play-off clash against AEL Limassol, which Spurs lead 2-1 after the first leg. He said: ‘I was there, I watched the United game. It is a good example for us to be ready. We got a good result in Cyprus but we need to be focused.’ On the move? Pochettino is eyeing a loan move for Manchester United forward Danny Welbeck (above) Michael Dawson has been sold to Hull but the arrival of Argentine defender Fazio means Spurs are still loaded with centre-halves. They now have Fazio, Younes Kaboul, Eric Dier, Jan Vertonghen and Vlad Chiriches, who is fit after a back problem and in tonight’s squad, plus young players like Zeki Fryers and Milos Veljkovic. ‘We need to give balance to the squad,’ said Pochettino, who is open to making more signings. ‘I don’t talk about names, never. I always say not to expect a lot of movement but it is possible that we add some players, yes.’ Shock: Pochettino was in the crowd to watch United lose 4-0 to minnows MK Dons . Spurs have to sell to create space for Pochettino to achieve the blend he desires, but are finding it hard to sell the ones they want, at the prices they want. Roberto Soldado, not in the squad to play AEL because of a bad back, is on AC Milan’s short-list, though the Italians appear to be making progress with a loan deal for Fernando Torres from Chelsea. Lewis Holtby has emerged as a possible departure, with Hamburg interested in the midfielder. Kaboul and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris are the main contenders to replace Dawson as club captain, though Pochettino will not make a decision until the transfer activity is over. Safe hands: Hugo Lloris is one of the main contenders to succeed Michael Dawson as Tottenham captain . Asked if he wanted to succeed Michael Dawson as captain, Hugo Lloris said: 'I don’t really need to wear the armband to feel like a leader for the team. I am very proud to the captain for the French national team. 'For Tottenham it is just the manager’s decision. I am not expecting something about that, I am just trying to do my job in the best way, and I try to help the team to have the best performance. 'And after, in the changing room, I know that I have my place, and I try to be an example for everyone, and especially for my young team-mates because in the squad there are a lot of young players.” VIDEO Top of the table no concern for Pochettino .","Mauricio Pochettino eyeing loan move for Danny Welbeck .

'This defeat changes nothing regarding the transfer market,' Ancelotti insisted. 'It's our problem, of concentration. We have to work much harder not to make these mistakes. Something has to change and it's going to change.' It comes as United won the race to sign Falcao from Monaco on a one-year loan ahead of rivals Manchester City and Real.

"A 19-year-old New York City man has died after partially-decapitating himself with his own remote-controlled helicopter. Roman Pirozek Jr, was pulling a stunt with the chopper at a Brooklyn park Thursday afternoon when he lost control and the RC device flew into his head. The blades sliced off a piece of his skull and slashed his throat. Pirozek was an avid model helicopter enthusiast, who was vice-president of a local hobby club. He posted several videos of himself flying helicopters on YouTube. One clip shows him putting his Trex 700 helicopter through incredible tricks. The video culminates with him dropping the $1,500 model from the sky, only to restart the rotor when it is just inches from his head. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Roman Pirozek Jr, 19, is pictured here with the model helicopter that killed him. He was an enthusiast who was a member of a New York RC helicopter club . Tricks: A video posted on Pirozek's YouTube page a year ago shows him performing multiple stunts with his RC chopper - including some that appear to be close to his own head . Crime scene: Police detectives examine the high-end $1,500 RC helicopter that sliced off a piece of Priozek's head on Thursday . Deadly instrument: This is a piece of the carbon-fiber model helicopter propeller that sliced off a piece of Pirozek's head . The high-end RC helicopter has a blade span of 62 inches, with a rotor that spins at more than 2,000rpm. It weighs a little over six pounds. Pirozek's own father watched in horror as his son's helicopter slashed off a chunk of his head, the Wall Street Journal reports. The teenager was dead when police arrived at the field. Pictures from the scene show the remote control near his covered body. 'He was known to be aggressive in his flying and often executed tricks. He was executing a trick when he was struck,' a police source told the Journal. Pirozek and at least three other members of his model helicopter club, Seaview Rotary Wings, were at Calvert Vaux Park in Brooklyn, New York, near Coney Island. The park is a designated spot for model aircraft enthusiasts to fly their creations. Police say Roman Pirozek Jr., 19, was dead when officers arrived on the scene. His remote control can be seen nearby . Pirozek's father reportedly watched him die. Friends said the father got his son interested in remote control helicopter flying . Deadly consequences: Priozek's shattered sunglasses and a piece of the rotor can be seen next to the sheet that covers his body . Priozek was vice-president of Seaview Rotatary Rings and recently participated in a demonstration in Delaware. An aerial photo taken from a WNBC news chopper showed a Brooklyn detective examining the small toy, which landed on its rotor in the grass. His body was just 20 feet away. Police say the aircraft fell from the sky and slashed him in the head and the throat on the way down. Pirozek's family said his father, Roman Pirozek Sr., introduced his son to the hobby.","Roman Pirozek Jr, 19, was an avid RC helicopter hobbyist .

"A mother-of-two whose estranged husband poured industrial-strength Lye over her in a horrific attack that left her so disfigured she's awaiting a face transplant claims she wouldn't take back what happened to her. In a captivating new book, Carmen Tarleton, 44, says she is 'more blessed' now than she was before her ex, Herb Rodgers, broke into her home five years ago and unleashed his anger. 'When life gives you a big negative situation like I'd been through, if you can get through that, you can really find all of the blessings and all of the positive things that can come out of that,' she said. 'And I found so much that I would not go back. I'm so much more blessed than I was then.' Brave: Carmen Tarleton, 44, pictured prior to her face transplant surgery, says she is 'more blessed' now than she was before the 2007 attack . While she lay in a hospital bed after surviving what doctors called 'the most horrific injury a human being could suffer,' Tarleton decided it did not have to ruin the rest of her life. She had vivid dreams, including one where dozens of doors stretched around her and a voice said 'Life is a choice,' before the words appeared one at a time in white across a dark movie screen: LIFE IS A CHOICE. Tarleton carried that lesson with her through her ongoing, daunting and remarkable recovery from the attack, which also saw Rodgers beat her with a baseball bat. Tarleton's book, to be published in March, is called 'Overcome: Burned, Blinded and Blessed,' and she hopes it will speak to everyone, not just victims of abuse. 'I think I can help a whole bunch of people, not just domestic violence (victims),' said the woman, who continues to undergo surgeries. 'I think I can help a whole bunch of people wherever you are in your life.' Before: Tarleton, pictured, was suffered burns over 80 per cent of her body in the horrific act of domestic abuse . Face transplant: Tarleton, pictured at high school in 1986, received the face transplant earlier this month . The book starts with Tarleton's decision at 28 to move across the country from her native Vermont to Los Angeles, with her two children in tow, to work as a nurse at a UCLA hospital. There she met Rodgers, whom she eventually married. The family moved back to Thetford, where her marriage started to unravel — in part over Rodgers' dishonesty, she writes. Tarleton recalls what she now says was a premonition. One evening when she was about to leave for her night shift at the hospital, her 12-year-old daughter was sobbing in her bedroom. When she asked what was wrong, her daughter said, . 'Something really, really bad is going to happen to you.' Eight months later, it did. Rodgers is serving a minimum of 30 years in prison for the June 2007 attack. When she set out to write the book three years later with only limited vision in one eye, she stalled when it came time to explain what Rodgers had done to her that night. She had to coach herself through it. Sickening: The mother-of-two, pictured while awaiting surgery, said reliving the night of the attack for her book was 'sickening' Horrific: Doctors called what Tarleton, pictured before surgery, experienced 'the most horrific injury a human being could suffer' 'Alone at my magnifying machine, I felt physically ill with what I was doing,' she wrote. 'The experience of reliving that night, trying to capture every detail as vividly as I remembered it, was sickening. Halfway through, I let my pen drop and rushed to my bedroom, the edges of my limited vision blackening.' It took her two days to write it. It was scary, but it was what she wanted to do, she said. She talked out the rest of the book and recorded it. She hired Writers of the Round Table Press to write it all down, including dialogue she had recalled. 'I was paying attention, because some of it I couldn't forget if I wanted to,' she said. She writes about facing Rodgers in court, how she dealt with being blind and disfigured, her pain, the help she has received from her community, family and friends, and how she came to forgive the man who maimed her so she could get on with her own life. In prison: Herb Rodgers, pictured, is serving a minimum of 30 years in prison for the June 2007 attack on his wife . Uplifting: Tarleton's book 'Overcome: Burned, Blinded and Blessed' is on shelves from March . 'That's where I feel people get stuck because we don't have a segment of our society that says just because this terrible thing happened to you it doesn't have to ruin the rest of your life,' she said. 'And I want to be the example of that because it doesn't.' Publishing the book was a no-brainer for Writers of the Round Table Press, said vice president David Cohen. 'Taking that kind of experience and turning that energy into something positive and wanting to go out there and effect change with as much as she had to overcome, to me was just striking,' Cohen said. As Tarleton awaits approval for a procedure that could help her get a face transplant, she looks forward to feeling well enough to speak publicly again about her ordeal to help others. She has had several recent surgeries to install a catheter in her chest and was sick last winter with hyperthyroidism. She has plans to write other books and has started a blog on the book's website, in a bid to share her positive attitude with others.","Carmen Tarleton, 44, suffered burns to 80 per cent of her body five years ago .

"Tormented: Jordan was bullied mercilessly at school and even had to move because of it . He's the Michael Bublé tribute act turned Mr England singing sensation but life hasn't always been smooth sailing for Jordan Williams. The 25-year-old has revealed that he was bullied while at school and that his experience is the reason for his insistence that proceeds from his new Christmas single go to an anti-bullying charity. Now the campaigner is calling for the Government to take action against sites like Ask.fm and says he was horrified by the suicide of Loughborough schoolgirl Hannah Smith, 14, who committed suicide after being abused online. 'It does just show how powerful these sites can be,' said Williams in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'When such things have happened and continue to happen, . I certainly do think they should be investigated and discussed - at the . very least heavily supervised. 'Kids are very vulnerable, some more than . others, and these kind of sites can provide an opportunity for bullies to hurt . people anonymously so I personally feel they do more . harm than good and absolutely need to be investigated.' Scroll down for video . Campaign: Jordan Williams, a.k.a Mr England, hopes his new single will make a difference to bullying victims . Williams also spoke of his own experience of bullying and spoke of his hurt at being picked on at school, although he adds that he's now moved on. 'My experience was the same as most other kids in the same situation really,' he explains. 'I was made to feel very unwelcome by certain people through that time and like many other kids found it difficult and very uncomfortable to the point where I didn't want to be there or be part of the school. 'In the end I moved school because of it,' he says, adding: 'It's the best move I ever made.' And what would he do if a young . friend came to him and revealed that they were being bullied? According . to Williams, letting them know that help is at hand is crucial. 'I would sit down with them offer to help and tell them there is help out there and that you can overcome it,' he explains. Living the dream: Despite the bullies doing their worst, Jordan went on to become this year's Mr England . Festive: Mr England, a.k.a Jordan Williams, is to release a charity Christmas single called Here We Are . 'I would suggest they . talk to someone, if not a parent, a teacher or a connections . officer, and someone will help you.' He adds: 'Bullying doesn't have to wreck your life and it . can be beaten and overcome but the most important thing is to talk to . someone.' Now, he hopes that his Christmas single, entitled Here We Are (Merry Christmas), will help children being bullied overcome their tormentors and start enjoying life again. 'I think the Government could perhaps do . more,' he adds. 'I think there is help for kids but bullying is something that can . affect a person for their whole lives so of course there's no such thing . as enough investment. 'I'm really hoping people get behind [the song] so we can all try make a . big difference and help as many kids in similar situations as possible . and, who knows, hopefully prevent tragedies like Hannah Smith from happening again.'

"Just short of turning 33, Serena Williams is having her own house built in Palm Beach and finally moving out from living with sister Venus, even if she is only heading down the street. This week she is presenting her latest collection of designer clothes at New York Fashion Week. So much goes on in her life it is a wonder she has time to keep racking up the Grand Slam titles. Before heading straight to the fashion studios yesterday she visited a sponsoring bank to discuss her latest US Open triumph, having beaten her great friend Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 6-3. She now has 18 Grand Slam titles, putting her level with Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. Relaxed: US Open champion Serena Williams claims she is as fit as ever after winning at Flushing Meadows . Strangely, the European-style home in Florida she is building — in association with an architect all the way from San Francisco — has what she describes as a ‘shrunken’ trophy room from her last house. Almost as big, she said, will be a purse room. ‘I have a bag problem so I decided to go with that,’ she added. All this should not be construed as a lessening of her desire to win. Indeed, there were some ominous messages for her would-be rivals interspersed with musings about her personal habits. ‘Every year I feel more fit. I just feel better, it’s the strangest thing. Thirty is the new 15,’ she said, laughing. Best of friends: Serena Williams had to defeat her good friend Caroline Wozniacki to prevail in New York . Even for an exceptional — and sometimes unfathomable — athlete such as Williams it is going to be quite a task at her age to pass the next landmark in sight, which is Steffi Graf’s total of 22 Grand Slams. Eighteen is already a towering achievement, and we will never know how much Graf’s tally may have been inflated by the grotesque piece of fortune that saw her biggest threat reduced after Monica Seles was stabbed in 1993. After winning on Sunday night, Williams’s coach Patrick Mouratoglou praised the ‘humility’ she had shown in going back to basics and working hard following the debacle at Wimbledon, which may have been contributed to by the on-off nature of her personal relationship with the Frenchman. ‘I feel like I’ve always had a humble spirit, I don’t have an ego,’ she responded. ‘I had to really find a way of winning matches and tournaments again, to beat players that weren’t the top-ranked players but playing really hard against me. Big night out: (left-right) Gigi Hadid, Serena Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and Joe Jonas hit New York . ‘People were coming so hard at me, so I had to figure out a way to be better.’ From the depths of the Wimbledon episode, when she retired from the doubles looking totally dazed, she has risen again, but insisted she could not remember what she was feeling two months ago. ‘I’m not quite sure if I was even able to think,’ she said. ‘I didn’t leave the bed. I didn’t even leave the country until after the finals, which never happens (when beaten early). If anything it was just trying to get healthy.’ Of her place in the sport’s pantheon of greats she is unsure: ‘People are always so quick to say legend — “Now that you’re a legend” — and I’m saying, “Hold on, take it one day at a time”. Release: Williams can't hide her emotions after cruising to the US Open title, beating Wozniacki 6-3 6-3 . ‘I feel like 19 is my goal now, not 22. I definitely overdid it and put way too much pressure on myself for 18, but at least I’ll learn. Going into the next Slam there will be no pressure.’ Looking at the competition, while there are some strong new players coming through, there appear few obvious challengers to her overall superiority, although certain players are good enough to cause her particular problems in certain environments. These include Petra Kvitova on grass, Simona Halep and Maria Sharapova on clay and, if she gets back to full form, Victoria Azarenka on hard courts. The women’s game is relatively open, and the men’s seems to be heading that way, with Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic battling for the men's title on Monday. At home: Williams clearly enjoys her home Grand Slam, winning the US Open six times during her fine career . There is enough out there to keep Williams honest, and she does not know how long she will play on. ‘I would love to go out on top but who wouldn’t?’ she said. ‘Everyone does, I can’t write the end of my story. I don’t know how it will end.’ One thing Williams will not elaborate on is the state of her love life. It is, of course, her own business, but it does appear to have had a bearing on her tennis this year. Referring to her upcoming tournaments in China she, came up with one of her better one-liners: ‘No time for love when I’ve got to go to Wuhan.’","Serena Williams beat Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 6-3 in the US Open final .

"The announcement of his loan move to AC Milan finally ends a three-and-a-half year spell of personal hell for Fernando Torres. The £50million centre forward arrived from Liverpool on deadline day in January 2011 and every season since has seen the Stamford Bridge narrative dominated by talk of whether the big-money flop could lead the line. Unfortunately for the Spaniard, he never quite managed it - although there were some standout moments in a period that saw him win club silverware for the first time in his career. Here’s Sportsmail look at Torres' top five Chelsea moments... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fernando Torres' best moments in a Chelsea shirt . Finally! Fernando Torres scores his first goal for Chelsea against West Ham United in April 2011 . 5) Breaking the duck at Stamford Bridge . A 903-minute drought gave a sign of things to come as Torres struggled to even get his Chelsea career off to a decent start. Beginning with a performance that saw him substituted in his debut against former club Liverpool, the Spanish striker found it difficult to adapt to his new surroundings before finally getting off the mark in late April. With Chelsea already a goal to the good, Nicholas Anelka's through ball sent Torres clear on goal, one-on-one with Rob Green but with defenders in pursuit. He made it to the edge of the penalty area but at a rain-soaked Stamford Bridge the ball was halted by a puddle, forcing him to double-back on himself before curling a fine left-footed finish past Green - which was wildly celebrated by his team-mates. Relief: Torres runs off and celebrates his goal against West Ham by blowing a kiss to the Chelsea fans . 4) Real quality with a hat-trick against QPR . With Chelsea preparing for the Champions League final, Roberto Di Matteo gave some of his second-string a chance against struggling QPR - and that included Torres. On a rare hark back to his Liverpool days, the hitman managed three of his 20 Premier League goals in a treble as he ripped apart the Rs defence, scoring Chelsea’s third, fourth and fifth goals in a 6-1 rout. Di Matteo later spoke about how the team were finally playing to Torres’ strengths, although it didn’t last long as he drew blanks against Newcastle, Liverpool and Blackburn as Chelsea finished sixth. At the treble: Torres scored a hat-trick for Chelsea against West London rivals QPR on April 29, 2012 . Arms aloft: Torres (right) is joined by captain John Terry (left) in celebration after netting his hat-trick goal . 3) Taking apart seemingly-unbeatable Manchester City . Having wildly shot over the bar with just the keeper to beat earlier in the game, Torres turned on the style to become Chelsea’s matchwinner against eventual champions Manchester City. First, he tore past Gael Clichy with ease before putting the ball on a plate for Andre Schurrle to score the opener, before Sergio Aguero equalised for City, and after performing as a real No 9 should on a rare occasion in a Chelsea shirt, he scored the winner. It came from a mix-up between Matija Nastastic and Joe Hart but Torres was on hand to knock the ball into the net before screaming in celebration in front of the Shed End. Jose Mourinho later spoke of how Torres deserved his chance to win the game with an easy opportunity after a sensational performance - although it again proved to be another false dawn and his name didn’t appear on the scoresheet again for almost two months as Chelsea struggled to find an option upfront. Predator: Torres pounced on a Manchester City defensive mix-up to bag a last-minute winner in October 2013 . Celebration: Torres runs off and screams with joy after bagging the winner against Manchester City . 2) Amsterdam impact against Benfica . Torres managed six goals in Chelsea’s Europa League campaign, including strikes in both the quarter- and semi-finals, but the most impressive was saved for the final. He showed a combination of pace and strength to escape the attentions of Ezequiel Garay and Luisao before rounding the goalkeeper and scoring from a tight angle to give his side the lead. It was the Torres Chelsea thought they had signed for £50m back in 2011 - strong, pacey and able to find the finishing touch. The Europa League was Torres’ most productive competition, but he did well in Europe generally for the Blues and leaves as their third-highest all-time top European goalscorer behind only Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard. Big occasion: Torres opened the scoring during Chelsea's victory over Benfica in the 2013 Europa League final . Give us a kiss! The Spanish striker celebrates with the Europa League trophy after the victory over Benfica . 1) Sealing most-unlikely Nou Camp triumph . With Chelsea down to 10 men and already written off against the world’s greatest club side, they produced one of the best performances by an English side in European competition - and Torres capped it. Over two legs and 120 minutes Chelsea were consistently battered by Pep Guardiola’s Tiki-taka champions but despite John Terry’s red card the score was tied at 2-2 on aggregate, with Chelsea going through on away goals. Lionel Messi missed a penalty, the woodwork worked in Chelsea’s favour and Petr Cech was on top form but memories of Andres Iniesta’s last-minute winner two years previous still loomed large in supporters’ thoughts. With the clock ticking down substitute Torres tried to alleviate pressure by running out of defence but lost the ball to Xavi - yet Ashley Cole’s desperate clearance then found the No 9 alone just inside his own half. Sprinting forward, he rounded Victor Valdes before an ice-cool finish sent Chelsea to Munich and wrote Torres into Stamford Bridge folklore forever. Best moment: Undoubtedly Torres' most memorable goal at Chelsea was his strike at the Nou Camp in 2012 . Get in there! Torres' goal ensured Chelsea progressed to the Champions League final at Barcelona's expense . PS: He played a role in Chelsea's greatest ever night, too... Didier Drogba might be the man remembered for Chelsea’s Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich but Torres played his part too. Coming on as an 84-minute substitute with Bayern a goal to the good, Torres ran down the right flank and was tackled, leading to Chelsea’s first corner of the night. Juan Mata took the set-piece and Drogba powerfully headed it home - and the rest is history. Glory: Fernando Torres celebrates with the Champions League trophy after Chelsea's victory in 2012 .

Markell on Thursday announced more than $5 million in state funding to help turn around six struggling Wilmington schools that are the lowest-performing district schools in the state. While using an online social networking system to compose a tweet about the announcement with a photo, a Markell staffer inadvertently deleted part of the photo link. The result was a photo that apparently was posted in 2010 by a model who goes by the name 'Precious Little.' Markell's office quickly deleted the tweet and apologized for the error, saying it would have been nice if the accidental link had been a cat video. This apology tweet was posted after the accidental bondage photo was posted in Gov. Jack Markell's page .","Jack Markell's office mistakenly tweeted the photo while publicizing a public education initiative .

"Water drips from the ceiling and splashes on to chairs and the large desk in Barnet manager Martin Allen’s office. It is two hours until their game against bottom-of-the-table Alfreton Town kicks off. Allen has invited Sportsmail behind the scenes of his Conference table-topping side and there is a small gathering of us. He is behind his desk, partner Lisa is in a chair opposite, on a sofa to the right sit a young couple in their mid-20s, Iain Dalziel and his girlfriend Maddie Bines. Dalziel is a life-long Barnet fan who never missed a game until they moved to The Hive in 2013. Out of protest he has not been since, but Allen has invited him as a VIP guest to change his mind. Next to them is Tom Clee, the club’s media man. Behind: Barnet boss Martin Allen with Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham (left) and  team analyser Omar Yabroudi . Sharing a laugh: Allen invited Sportsmail to Barnet to get behind the scenes of the Conference-topping side . Marcus Maddison, Peterborough’s 20-year-old midfielder, scored his second goal in three games since moving from Conference side Gateshead in their 3-1 win over Port Vale. Maddison impressed at the start of the season with four goals in five matches, earning a move to Peterborough. The victory kept them top of League One. Cheltenham Town have now gone six games unbeaten to move top of League Two. Their goalless draw away to Morecambe, who are now in second place, edged them ahead of Burton to the summit of the table. Conference side Woking maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 3-1 victory against Lincoln. They sit third in the table behind Barnet and Halifax but are the only side in the league not to lose this season. They have won four — including three in succession — and drawn the other three to stay three points off the top. There is a stack of white envelopes to Allen’s left on the desk. He picks the top one up — which is soaked in water — curls it into a ball and throws it in the bin. ‘That’s the third one I’ve thrown away since we got here,’ he says. ‘I’ve been told it’s OK by the health and safety man as it’s not near the plug sockets.’ His eyebrows rise slightly in alarm as he nods at the electrical sockets less than a metre away. Mad Dog Allen points around the room at the orange-and-black paint which covers the grey bricks. ‘When I was out of work I watched a series called Prison Break on Netflix,’ he adds. ‘When I arrived here in March, that’s what this office looked like — a prison cell. So we got it painted in the club’s colours.’ Allen is completely relaxed ahead of kick-off: conversation flows — ranging from his gardening hobby to the 16-year-old striker who is on the bench for the first time. Lisa has to move seats at one point because a drip from the dodgy plumbing has developed over her chair. There is a knock at the door, swiftly followed by a voice anyone who loves football would recognise. It’s John Motson. Allen gets up to shake his hand, Motson wishes the team luck and the pair walk out of the room. While they’re gone, Dalziel explains that Motson is a huge Barnet fan, lives locally and is a regular at The Hive when he is not working. The dream: Allen was completely relaxed before kick off and gave off lively conversation with Sportsmail . The dreaded leak: The room is a constant flow of activity in and out - almost as constant as the drips . Allen returns five minutes later. ‘He just gave the players a team talk,’ he reveals, excitedly. ‘I like to let people into the dressing room for matches. It keeps the players relaxed. ‘For away games we even surprise some fans by picking them up on the team bus near to the stadium.’ The room is a constant flow of activity in and out. Almost as constant as the drips. Player-coach Jon Nurse steps in to update Allen on the players arriving on time. Allen has barely any staff at his disposal to free up extra money for player wages. Nurse, a forward, and goalkeeper Graham Stack, 32, help out with coaching. Allen explains that Nurse, 33, brought up his brother when he was 16 after their mother died of breast cancer. ‘I could barely look after myself at the time,’ Nurse adds. At 2pm, Allen ushers everyone else out of the room and their analyst-cum-scout Omar Yabroudi, 24, enters with the Alfreton team-sheet to go through some final preparations for the game. Analysing: Allen ushers everyone else out of the room at 2pm to discuss tactics with 24-year-old Yabroudi . Making marks: Allen and Co use the Alfreton team-sheet to go through some final preparations for the game . ‘When Omar arrived he told me he wanted to be a scout,’ Allen says. ‘But he couldn’t drive. The next day, he turns up in the back of a silver Mercedes driven by a bloke wearing a black cap. It turns out his dad is a billionaire from building tower blocks in Dubai. He’s got to be the richest scout in the world.’ Barnet pay him nothing. Just before the players go out to warm up, Allen’s final team talk is brief, but stern. Arms flail and fingers point at the players whose attention is trained on him. It is goalless at half-time and Barnet are lucky to still have centre-back David Stephens on the pitch after an altercation with Alfreton striker Massiah McDonald. Referee Paul Rees shows just a yellow card. Goalless at HT: Barnet were lucky to still have centre-back David Stephens on the pitch but got away with it . Back: Allen is furious with his team’s performance and storms back to the dressing room at half time . Allen is furious with his team’s performance and storms back to the dressing room. Alfreton manager Nicky Law is just as angry. He follows the referee down the tunnel, where he explains he does not have to speak to him at half time. ‘Hear me out,’ Law says, wide-eyed. ‘He had both hands around his neck.’ Alfreton take a shock lead just after the break — McDonald heading in — but 15 minutes later Barnet are level when John Akinde is fouled for a penalty and Lathaniel Rowe-Turner is sent off. Charlie MacDonald scores the spot-kick. From the touchline Allen is exerting as much, if not more, energy than his players. It is all worth it when substitute Luisma Villa hits a bullet free kick to win the game in stoppage time. Get in! Barnet captain Charlie MacDonald scores the spot-kick en route to their 72-point mark . Rap music pumps from a speaker in the dressing room as the Barnet players celebrate the victory. Allen gives a speech then ends it with: ‘Jack Saville, you showed a lot of courage today so you get the pen.’ He throws a pen to the defender, who strolls up to a white board, as the players cheer in a crescendo, and writes ‘72’ in the corner. Back in his office, Allen explains: ‘We started the season with 90 in the corner of the board, that’s how many points we need to win the league. After every game, provided we pick up points, I pick a player who deserves to write up how many we have left. We need 72 points to win this league.’ Perhaps if Allen’s team win promotion to the Football League, those leaks in the office will finally be repaired. Celebration: Rap music pumps from a speaker in the dressing room as the Barnet players enjoy the win .

"A woman has been left in a critical condition after she was charged at by a cow which rolled and sat on her. Emma Moody was crossing a field in St Martin, Cornwall, when her dog disturbed a herd of cows and their young calves. After the cow began to charge at her, a terrified Ms Moody attempted to run away but tripped and fell into its path. Horror: A woman was airlifted to hospital after a cow charged at her before rolling and sitting on her. The accident happened in a field in St Martin, Cornwall. The village is pictured . The cow then trampled and rolled on her - breaking most of her ribs and leaving her with severe chest injuries. A Navy search and rescue helicopter from nearby RNAS Culdrose was dispatched to the farm where crews found her lying badly hurt in a meadow. She was airlifted to hospital where she today remains in a critical condition. Ms Moody’s mother Sue said her daughter had done everything she could to stop her dog scaring the herd and had kept it on its leash. She said: 'We feel the legislation needs looking at with regards to cows and young calves in fields where there is a public right of way. 'It’s not as if she was in a strange area or somewhere different where she didn’t know the farm or the walk . 'We are eternally grateful for the speed she was taken to hospital and treated - it was second to none.' The attack was revealed at a meeting of St Keverne Parish Council by Cornwall Councillor Walter Sanger. He said: 'People, although they can be legally on the public footpath, have to be aware and be cautious where there are cattle and especially cattle with calves.'","Emma Moody was crossing a field in St Martin, Cornwall .

"'Honoured': City executive Rona Fairhead will be the first permanent female chairman of the BBC . Ministers will today announce that the BBC is  to have its first permanent female chairman in the Corporation’s history. City executive Rona Fairhead has landed the £110,000-a-year job – just three months after David Cameron said he was ‘determined’ to appoint a woman to the role. Ms Fairhead, a former Financial Times group boss, was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when shareholders of parent company Pearson revolted over her £1.1 million pay-off. She voluntarily left the company after being passed over for chief executive. It led to 37 per cent of shareholders refusing to endorse the remuneration report. The 53-year-old, a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings and PepsiCo, and until recently on the board of the Cabinet Office, is the Government’s ‘preferred candidate’ to succeed Lord Patten as BBC Trust chairman. He announced in May that he would be standing down following heart surgery. The race was then blown open when previous frontrunner Lord Coe said he was pulling out because he did not have the ‘capacity’ to do the job with his other commitments. Ms Fairhead will appear before the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee later this month for ‘pre-appointment scrutiny’. Chairman Tory MP John Whittingdale warned earlier this year that Mr Cameron should not try to ‘push through’ the appointment on the grounds of gender,  rather than merit. But he said last night: ‘Just because she is female does not mean that is the reason she was appointed. She has an excellent CV and wide experience, and I look forward to seeing her in front of the select committee.’ Ms Fairhead – also tipped  to become the new chairman of Barclays – said: ‘The BBC is a great British institution packed with talented people, and I’m honoured to have the opportunity to be chairman of the BBC Trust. 'I’m under no illusions about the significance or enormity of the job but am excited to have the chance to lead the BBC through the coming years.’ Experience: Ms Fairhead, a former FT group boss, voluntarily left parent company Pearson after being passed over for chief executive.

"Manchester United are still exploring ways of bringing in Real Madrid's wantaway winger Angel Di Maria and his club-mate Sami Khedira. In more positive news for United fans, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is bullish about bringing in two more players before the transfer window closes. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Thursday that both Di Maria and Khedira could leave. Di Maria has been target for United boss Louis van Gaal all summer while he knows Khedira from his time in Germany. VIDEO Scroll down to see Cristiano Ronaldo flick Angel di Maria the V in training .

Open offer: Carlo Ancelotti says ‘if Di Maria doesn’t find a solution for his future, we would welcome him back' Ancelotti said: ‘If Di Maria doesn’t find a solution for his future, we would happily welcome him back once the transfer market is over. ‘He asked to leave, he didn’t accept the proposal for the renewal of the contract. He’s a Real Madrid player and until August 31, as I’ve already said, anything can happen. ‘Khedira is a different situation. He’s not asked to go. He’s rejected an offer to renew, but has a year of contract. We’ll see what happens.’ These signings could appease United fans, who are growing angry with what they view as their club’s lacklustre approach to signing players and one faction is planning a demonstration at the home game with QPR next month. There is better news on the pitch as they will have striker Robin van Persie back in their squad for their Barclays Premier League game at Sunderland on Sunday after he returned to first-team training on Thursday. Getting ready: Carlo Ancelotti (left) and German midfielder Toni Kroos during training .

It’s not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… there’s £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest-scoring manager . Van Persie has not played for new manager Van Gaal yet after being given extra time to get fit in the wake of his journey to the last four of the World Cup in July. But after training the striker revealed he is ready to play. ‘Good training session done this morning,’ he said on Twitter. ‘Looking forward to Sunday.’ Van Persie was overlooked for the United captaincy by Van Gaal, even though the two men are close and the 31-year-old was his manager’s skipper during the World Cup. However, Van Persie is crucial to United’s hopes of success this season and if he thinks he is fit enough Van Gaal will team him up with captain Wayne Rooney against Sunderland. Van Gaal will hand a debut to defender Marcos Rojo on Sunday.The 24-year-old trained with his new team-mates on Thursday and is expected to play on the left of Van Gaal’s defensive three. ‘It is an honour for me to now say that I play for Manchester United,’ said Rojo on Thursday night. ‘I am young and am very keen to continue to learn the game, so playing for such an experienced technical coach as Louis van Gaal is a fantastic opportunity for me. I have joined United to work hard with my team-mates to win trophies and I know the manager shares that ambition.’ New: Van Gaal will hand a debut to defender Marcos Rojo on Sunday after the 24-year-old trained . Pointers: New-signing Rojo says 'it is an honour for me to now say that I play for Manchester United' United were missing nine players when they lost to Swansea at Old Trafford last Saturday. On Thursday they welcomed Jonny Evans and Antonio Valencia back to training, who should help to ease the defensive burden this weekend. Further tests on Marouane Fellaini’s ankle have revealed no real ligament damage, so United hope to move the Belgian on this month. Meanwhile, Sunderland keeper Vito Mannone, the penalty shootout hero as the Black Cats beat United to reach the Capital One Cup final last January, is out to heap more misery on Van Gaal. Mannone said: ‘I believe we can win. In the Premier League I don’t think the difference is that massive.

"Click here to read Adrian Durham's column  reference to Jack Colback as the 'ginger Pirlo'. Roy Hodgson has labelled Jack Colback as the 'ginger Pirlo' after calling the Newcastle midfielder up to the England squad. The 24-year-old will enjoy his first taste of international football after impressing at the back end of last season with Sunderland before a controversial move to Tyneside. 'Someone who knows him very well called Jack the ""ginger Pirlo"" - let's hope that becomes true,' said Hodgson, whose side face Norway and Switzerland next week. VIDEO Scroll down for Hodgson: No reason for young players to fear Euro campagin . Called up: Jack Colback will get his first taste of international football with England next week . Really? Roy Hodgson likened Colback to the mercurial midfielder Andrea Pirlo . Pirlo is, of course, one of the world's finest ball players and a nemesis of England in previous major tournaments. While the comment wasn't made with any level of expectation attached - harking back to Sportsmail's Adrian Durham's column about the youngster earlier this month - Hodgson has sparked anger among supporters online. One disgruntled fan said: 'If Jack Colback ever plays for England I'm moving country and supporting Costa Rica.' Many vented on Twitter, but Colback's pass completion percentage was remarkably higher than that of the mercurial Italian last season. Pirlo did, however, create treble the chances while at Juventus and made more goals. Fresh start: Hodgson announced his new-look England squad at Wembley on Thursday . Durham said on August 18: 'Jack Colback is England class – his set-pieces are phenomenal. And he’s got bottle as well. 'This kid isn’t stupid. He’s a Geordie who’s well aware of the passions on Tyneside and Wearside. These fans don’t hold back when it comes to rivalries. Even punching a horse isn’t off limits when it’s Newcastle vs Sunderland. 'So for a Newcastle fan to make the move from Sunderland to St James’ Park, and on a free transfer – well, you’ve got to admire Colback’s balls. 'And check out his Newcastle debut. Sure they lost, but you’ve got to have a small-minded football brain to think there were no positives for Alan Pardew after the match, and Colback was one of them. Pass master: Colback's completion rate was actually higher than Pirlo's last season . 'He’s the Ginger Pirlo, trusted with the set-pieces, and delivering good service with most of them. I like this kid, and I can’t help thinking that if he’d come through at Arsenal, Liverpool or even the 'boutique' academy at Southampton, Colback would have had an England call-up by now.' Meanwhile, Pirlo will miss the first month of the Serie A season because of a bruised right hip. He was injured in a pre-season match and Juventus say he's pulled a tendon that requires 30 days to heal. He will miss italy's games next week and the old Lady's Champions League opener.

"It was a meeting of epic proportions. The world's tallest and shortest men met for the first time this morning to commemorate Guinness World Record Day. Sultan Kösen, who is 8ft 1in. tall, and Chandra Dangi, who measures just 21.5ins., posed for photos outside the Houses of Parliament to mark the  book's 60th anniversary. Scroll down for video . (Very) high five: Mr Dangi, who measures just 22.5 ins, and 8ft 1in tall Mr Kosen, meet in London today . First time ever: Mr Kosen and Mr Dangi  met to commemorate the 10th annual Guinness World Records Day . Shortest man ever: Mr Dangi is the same height as six cans of baked beans stacked on top of each other . The two men join hundreds of others who are taking part in a number of record attempts across the world to celebrate the occasion. The annual broke a record of its own in 2004 when it became the world's best-selling copyright book. Guinness World Record Day was set up to commemorate the date. Mr Kösen, 31, from Ankara, Turkey, became the world's tallest living man in 2009, when he took the title from 63-year-old Xi Shun, from China, who measured 7 ft 8.95 ins. in 2005. Mr Kösen, a part-time farmer, was the first man over 8ft to be measured by the company in over 20 years - and one of only 10 people on record to break the height barrier. Mr Kösen  also holds the record for largest hands of a living person, each one measuring 11.22 in from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger. And he previously held the record for largest feet on a living person, with his left foot measuring 1 ft 2 ins and right foot measuring 1 ft 1.98 ins. Mr Kosen, pictured with Mr Dangi also holds the record for the largest hands of a living person . Celebration: Part-time farmer Mr Kosen, from Turkey, and Mr Dangi, who lives in a remote Nepalese village . Mr Dangi, pictured with Mr Kosen today, was declared the shortest living adult human in 2012 . Speaking at the time of his entry into the Guinness World Records, he said: 'I never imagined I would be in the book, I dreamed about it, but it was still a huge surprise'. Mr Dangi, who lives in the isolated Nepalese village of Reemkholi, some 335miles southwest of Kathmandu, is the shortest adult human to have their height verified by Guinness. At just 21.5ins, Mr Dangi is the same size as six cans of baked beans stacked on top of each other. He beat the benchmark set by Gul Mohammed, from New Delhi, India, who measured 22.5ins. Three of his five brothers were less than four feet tall, while his two sisters and two brothers are of average height. Record-breakers: 373 people dressed as penguins gathered near Tower Bridge to be counted by Guinness . Charity: The playful record attempt was organised by the Richard House Children's Hospice in London . Nighttime stroll: The group then waddled around a 2km course that took in a number of London landmarks . Making it official: the record breaking charity event was verified by a Guinness World Record representative . Other world record attempts that are taking place today include the farthest basketball shot backwards and the most people eating breakfast in bed. Last night, hundreds of people  gathered near London's Tower Bridge to break the record of the largest gathering of people dressed as penguins. Organised by the Richard House Children's Hospice, the record breaking charity event was verified by a Guinness World Record official who counted 373 people dressed as the birds. The previous record was 325 participants. The group then waddled around a 2km course taking in sights such as the Tower of London, the Shard, City Hall and Tower Bridge. Record attempt: Earlier this week, a dog named Panya, pictured, took part in a record day in Hamburg . Goal: The dog was trying to break the record for the number of socks pulled off a washing line in one minute . Close: Panya needed to take off at least 14 socks, but only managed nine. It was not a Guinness Record event . Largest collection of rubber ducks . Charlotte Lee, from California, has 5,631 different rubber ducks, as of 10 April 2011, which she has been collecting since 1996. Most expensive pizza . The most expensive pizza, commercially available, is a thin-crust, wood fire-baked pizza topped with onion puree, white truffle paste, fontina cheese, baby mozzarella, pancetta, cep mushrooms, freshly picked wild mizuna lettuce and garnished with fresh shavings of a rare Italian white truffle, itself worth £1,400 (then $2,500) per 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz). Depending upon the amount of truffles available each season, the pizza is regularly sold at £100 (then $178) each to customers of Gordon Ramsey's Maze restaurant in London. Most Christmas trees chopped in two minutes . Erin Lavoie, from Virgina, US, chopped down 27 Christmas trees in just two minutes while on the set of Guinness World Records: Die GroBten Weltrekorde in Germany, on 19 December 2008. Most knives thrown around a human target in one minute . Dr David R.

"In the Orthodox Jewish community, where only men are allowed to file for divorce - one American rabbi became an advocate for the women by threatening and beating their husbands into submission. Without a divorce paper called a 'get' women who have separated from their husbands are unable to marry again, and have little resources to provide for themselves and their families, which can lead to desperate situations. Rabbi Mendel Epstein offered these women an alternative. Charging thousands of dollars, he would allegedly torture his fellow Orthodox men into signing the gets and freeing their wives. But the 69-year-old's operation came crashing down in a sting carried out by the FBI last year. Now, Epstein is largely confined to his home in Lakewood, New Jersey as he waits a trial scheduled for early next year. If convicted on multiple counts of kidnapping, he could be sent behind bars for 25 years to life. Ringleader: Rabbi Mendel Epstein (pictured) is the man accused of leading a group who tortured fellow Orthodox Jewish men into agreeing to divorce their wives. In the Orthodox community, only the husbands are allowed to file for divorce . A recent article in GQ magazine traces his work in the community where he is considered both a bully and a savior. For years, Epstein's business obtaining 'gets' was not a big secret among the Orthodox Jews of New York and New Jersey, who consider it  blasphemous to report such crimes to secular law enforcement. But Epstein had been on the FBI's radar since the early 1990s when a group of Orthodox men came forward to detail traumatic experiences in which they were beat up or threatened by men who forced them to agree to a divorce. Victim: Meir Bryskman (pictured) was beat up in OCtober 2010 by a man named David Wax who says he was working for Epstein to obtain a 'get' for Bryskman's wife in israel . All of the men pointed to Epstein as the man responsible, but there wasn't enough evidence to pin him then. 'For a long time, it was always his name that came up. He was beating guys up, he was giving them bloody noses, he was using cattle prods. He had a gang of thugs, and he had a van, and he'd scoop you right off the street,' says New York therapist Monty Weinstein told GQ. Epstein's organization started to unfurl though in October 2010, when an Israeli-national named Meir Bryskman was beat up and forced to grant a 'get' when he traveled to America after separating from his wife. Bryskman was going to the home of David Wax in Lakewood one night that month, when he knocked on the door and was greeted with a punch in the nose. He was then blindfolded and beaten for some time as his captives warned the night would only end in 'a divorce or a funeral'. He says the men showed him a body bag so he could 'get used to the size', burned him with acid and threatened to take him to the Poconos where he would be eaten alive by rats. Fearing for his life, Bryskman agreed to the divorce and to wire his wife $100,000. Surprisingly, Bryskman broke Orthodox code and reported the incident to police,recalling the horrors of the terrifying night. Wax pleaded guilty to kidnapping last May, but told the court he was only carrying out the crime on behalf of Epstein. When police searched Wax's house, they found an invoice from Step on Me Carpet & Flooring for a $1,311.10 'emergency carpet installation'. Wax pleaded guilty to charges of kidnapping last May, but says he was only working for Epstein. Pictured above in New Jersey court in July 2011 . Prosecutors said Wax was part of Epstein's syndicate which 'engaged in the business of kidnapping and torturing people, beating them up, tying them up, shocking them with Tasers and stun guns until they got what they wanted'. That incident sparked the FBI to intervene, sending undercover agents pretending to be an Orthodox brother and sister to Epstein's offices to request his services in August 2013. The two made up a story about the sister's husband who was hiding out in South America, refusing to grant a divorce, and Epstein jumped at the opportunity to help them out - for about $50,000. The agents recorded the conversations they had with Epstein, in which he spoke in detail about his fees and how he went about coercing his victims. Epstein even talked about how they used electric cattle prods to torture men, since the tools leave behind no marks on the body as evidence of an attack. 'If it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move...; You put it in certain parts of his body and in one minute the guy will know,' Epstein said. Ouch: Epstein and his cronies allegedly used a cattle prod to torture their victims into agreeing to a divorce . Two months later, Epstein set up a trap for the alleged husband who was 'lured' back to the U.S. and set to be surprised by the rabbi and his cronies in a warehouse. Instead, the warehouse was surrounded by FBI agents who stormed in and arrested all eight men. Six of the eight men have pleaded guilty to charges of traveling in interstate commerce to commit extortion, while Epstein and another man await trail early next year on multiple counts of kidnapping. Epstein's lawyer Robert G Stahl hopes to win the case on the grounds that the government wrongly interfered in the religious matter. 'When all the facts and evidence come out, it will be apparent that the government is on the wrong side of a terrible social injustice,' Stahl said. 'By inserting itself into a complicated religious issue, the government has interfered with the complex religious tenets of an Orthodox Jewish marriage and divorce process. Rabbi Epstein has helped scores of abused women for some thirty years equal the playing field in a male-dominated religious world.'","In the Orthodox Jewish community, only men may file for divorce .

"A nurse is fighting for his life in hospital after becoming the first British victim of the ebola outbreak. William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone. Despite the grave dangers, he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work. Scroll down for video . Male nurse William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone . Police escorting British ebola patient William Pooley to the Royal Free Hospital in north London . Back in the UK: An RAF plane carrying a British man with Ebola lands at RAF Northolt in north-west London . The British man infected with the Ebola virus is loaded into an Royal Air Force ambulance after being flown home on a C17 plane from Sierra Leone, at Northolt air base outside London . He was described as a 'remarkable . young man' and a natural leader by an American scientist who worked at . the same hospital in Kenema. 'He had taken on a very big role,' said . Robert F Garry, a professor in microbiology at . Tulane University in New Orleans. 'We've lost several other nurses including the head nurse who lost her battle against ebola. 'He . was very well liked by all the nurses and had taken on a pivotal role. Some people are just marked out as leaders and he led the nurses. He was . a very hard worker and they looked up to him.' Mr Pooley last night arrived back to London in an isolation sack for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. Pictures have emerged of the moment a British charity worker was evacuated back to the UK on board a Royal Air Force jet . The patient was flown into an airport near London, then driven across the capital . Gabriel . Madiye, Mr Pooley's boss at another Sierra Leone clinic, said: 'Will . wanted to go to Kenema and help the patients at the hospital there. 'I . told him not to go, but Will said he felt a very strong responsibility . to the patients there as they were being abandoned by doctors and nurses . who were fearful of contracting the ebola virus. 'I told him he would not be able to withstand the disease but he said he had to go.' British charity worker, Mr Pooley, from Woodbridge in Suffolk, was diagnosed with ebola and airlifted out of Sierra Leone and taken to the High Security Infectious Disease Unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London (pictured) Treatment: The hospital is the only centre in the UK equipped to treat ebola and prevent the disease from spreading . Mr Madiye said Mr Pooley, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, had been volunteering at the ebola centre in Kenema for just five weeks. Previously . he had been providing palliative care to patients at the Shepherd's . Hospice in Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown, and had been there . since March. But as the . ebola epidemic began and he heard that healthcare professionals were . fleeing for fear of catching the disease, he decided to go to the . badly-affected region of Kenema, Mr Madiye said. Epidemic: Doctors assist patients in Sierra Leone, one of the countries worst affected by ebola . Deadly virus: A Briton is Sierra Leone has tested positive for deadly Ebola. Pictured above are health workers in Liberia carrying a female victim . Crisis: West African countries such as Sierra Leone and Liberia (pictured) have been hit particularly hard, and required military intevention to keep the peace . 'I . have been calling him for updates and he said he was fine, but for the . past five days I have tried to ring him and he hasn't called back,' said . Mr Madiye, who is the executive director of the Shepherd's Hospice. 'This . morning, he said he was being evacuated to Britain. He sounded positive . and said he would be fine in a couple of weeks and would call me then. He said the British doctors would save him.' Mr Pooley's doctors are said to be confident that, with urgent medical attention, he has a good chance of fighting the disease. Quarantine: Slums containing as many as 50,000 people have been cordoned off by African governments in a big to contain the outbreak. Pictured above is a man throwing containers of water across the boundaries . Waiting: Potential Ebola victims wait behind a cordon for food from a humanitarian aid shipment to arrive . Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus. ZMapp, . an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown . promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two US missionaries . who contracted the virus. But Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American . company behind it, says stocks are exhausted. A . source at the Department of Health said: 'We are working with our . international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.' Mr . Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola . outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when . scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with . the virus. Health officials . last night said Mr Pooley was 'not seriously unwell' – a factor which . will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of . ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and . their major organs fail. But . fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly . improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding . controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat . the virus. The World Health . Organisation has put the number of people infected with the deadly virus . at 2,615 and declared the crisis to be a 'global health emergency'. Some . 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March and . spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Last night two people were . reported to have died of ebola in the Congo, in what is thought to be a . new outbreak. Around 300 have become infected in Kenema, the district . where Mr Pooley was working. The . World Health Organisation approved ZMapp for use two weeks ago, an . extraordinary decision given that the drug had not been widely tested. It was used to treat Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly, who have since . been discharged from hospital. Britain's first ebola patient will be treated at the country’s only High Secure Infectious Disease Unit (HSIDU), at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London. It contains just two beds in a ward large enough to normally fit 20. The medic will be wheeled in, enclosed in the same isolation tent used to transport him from Sierra Leone, to minimise contamination risk. Expert: Dr Stephen Mepham will be among the medics treating the ebola patients . The unit contains an array of special equipment to ensure he does not pass on the virus – including a ‘negative pressure’ air flow to make sure no virus particles escape either the tent or the room itself. He will be treated by a specialist team including infectious diseases consultant Dr Stephen Mepham. Protection: Red Cross volunteers are pictured above in protective gear to defend them from infection . Dangerous: Ebola, which is transmitted through contact with fluids such as blood and mucus from infected people and animals, has killed more than 1,000 people in West Africa . Tests: A protected health worker scans a Liberian for signs of the deadly illness . Ebola is an infectious and usually fatal disease which spreads through contact with body fluids. Initial symptoms include muscle pain, fever and a sore throat which turns into severe internal bleeding from the mouth, rectum and eyes. The virus attacks almost all kinds of tissue, reducing organs and flesh to a pudding-like mush. Up to 90 per cent of victims die – making ebola one of the most lethal viruses known to man. Lethal: The virus, pictured above under a microscope, almost always kills . Most succumb within six to 16 days of infection. Since the disease was identified in 1976, no clinically proven cure has emerged. However, charity MSF has improved survival rates using antibiotics. Outbreaks have occurred primarily in remote villages in central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests.","William Pooley is first Briton to contract disease outside the laboratory .

"Christina Regusters, 21, is on trial on charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault and rape . A 19-year-old daycare worker accused of abducting a five-year-old girl from school by posing as her burkha-clad mother, raping her and leaving her half naked in a playground has been charged. Christina Regusters, from Philadelphia, was indicted yesterday on charges of aggravated assault, kidnapping, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and several other offenses in the January incident. Police say Regusters covered herself in a black Muslim burkha, similar to one the girl’s mother wears, when she pulled the child from her  classroom and walked her to a nearby home where she was sexually assaulted. The 19-year-old worked at an after-school care program the girl attended. The five-year-old was discovered shivering . half-naked on a playground about a mile from the school the morning . after her abduction on January 14. The . girl told a passerby, 'I've been stolen' and repeatedly spoke of a . talking bird inside the home that would 'peck her eyes out' if she . didn't stay hiding under a bed, philly.com reports. That talking bird proved crucial in police’s investigation, said Attorney Tom Kline who's representing the girl and her mother. Regusters, . who told the child her name was Tiffany, was one of four residents . questioned on about the abduction at the home several blocks from Bryant Elementary . School in west Philadelphia. The other three were later released. The 5-year-old victim was signed out at this Philadelphia school by a woman claiming to be her mother. She was missing for the next 20 hours . After she was taken to the home, the child was blindfolded, told to . remove her clothes and to put on a black, adult-sized T-shirt. She was then . ordered to hide under a bed. DNA on the shirt matched that found in the house, authorities said. The brave girl was instrumental in helping police find out where she was held captive, retracing her steps and leading police to the home with the bird. 'This brave, innocent precious little . girl was instrumental in leading police literally to the door of the . crime,' said Kline at the time. 'She told them that there was a bird in the house. The bird became one of the many focal points of the investigation,' he added. Kline . said the girl suffered 'terrible, horrible injuries' and that the . family was 'grateful' for the arrest, but knows it isn't the end of the . line. The child was discovered the next day, about 4:40am, after a man walking by heard her screams from this playground . Investigators believe after the suspect and victim successfully walked a few blocks to the home a man was waiting. 'There is still more work to be done,' Kline said adding that there were clearly additional people involved. 'We are watching anxiously the next developments because this is not the end of the line.' Regusters' attorney, W. Fred Harrison Jr., told WCAU-TV Regusters had 'no involvement' in the crime. Authorities believe she was dumped about 18 hours later at the park before found by a passerby who hear her screaming. Fear: The child told police that she was taken to a nearby house with a talking bird whose owner said would peck her eyes out if she didn't stay hiding under a bed . The child was hiding under a jungle . gym play set around 4.40am and it was unclear how long she had been outside. She was . freezing, as it was about 37 degrees outside and damp from rain the . night before. Nelson Mandela Myers who found her that morning said he asked where her parents were. 'She said, ""I don't know. Somebody . was chasing me. I ran"",' Myers said. 'She said she came from South . Philly. I knew something was wrong, because I knew she couldn't have run . from South Philly.' 'As he . starts to walk to where the screams are, a little girls runs out,' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told Philly.com. 'She said, ""I ran away, I ran away from the people who took me"".' The child was immediately taken to a nearby hospital to get checked out. News of the girl’s abduction sent waves through both the community and the school where the girl was successfully released to the woman without photo ID shown. About a week after the principal at the school was removed among four people held responsible for the horrific ordeal. The girl had been abducted from her school around 8:50am by a woman dressed in a burkha who called herself 'Tiffany' District officials . said the incident violated school procedure, which requires anyone . signing a child out of school to show ID and be on a list of as a . verified parent or guardian. Allowing . the girl to leave school with an unknown adult was a 'serious break in . procedure,' District spokesman Fernando Gallard said. The . woman didn't wait at the school's front office, as is policy, but went . to Robinson's classroom and told a teacher that the child had already . been 'checked out' of school. Robinson was not reported as missing until 3pm, when a caretaker from the child's after-school program came to pick her up. Her mother appeared on local media tearfully pleading for her safe return, and explaining how . she also wears the traditional chador and niqab - the type of clothing . that Robinson's abductor was wearing. The playground where the girl was found is adjacent to a baseball field and a residential neighborhood, where police focused their search for her abductors .","Police say Christina Regusters covered herself in a black Muslim veil  when she signed the girl out of school .

"The malicious attempt by rapper 50 Cent to humiliate his ex-friend Floyd Mayweather as semi-literate is reminiscent of how Muhammad Ali’s early reading difficulties were once exposed on television. And just as shameful. Ali stalked off the set after being asked to read a passage about himself from a book handed to him – deliberately upside down. How right he was to do so. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch 50 Cent call out Floyd Mayweather . Feud: Floyd Mayweather (left) was asked to read a passage from Harry Potter by rapper 50 Cent (right) Now Mr Cent – in a parody of the current celebrity ice-bucket challenge – has offered to donate $75,000 to charity if Mayweather is able to read a long passage from a Harry Potter book in public. That followed an apparent struggle by the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world to articulate a few printed words for an advertisement. Even rappers should know better. A feud has been brewing since Mayweather ended his part-buddy, part-professional relationship with 50 Cent, who he had helped into the boxing promotion business. But this latest barb is the lowest of low blows. The way it used to be: 50 Cent (left) and Mayweather used to be friends before their falling out . Whatever anyone thinks of Mayweather – and there are times when his flash arrogance and vulgar displays of his wealth can grate on the best of us – he does not deserve a shot even cheaper than this particular rapper’s half-dollar name. Mayweather’s contribution to boxing and the financial advancement of sportsmen generally will be remembered long after Mr Cent’s charmless recordings have been consigned to the studio waste-bin, . Mayweather has reacted by posting photographic images of the two cheques he has received for his most recent fights – against Canelo Alvarez and Marcos Maidana – totalling more than $72million. Also, as he prepares to bank tens of millions more by defending his world titles and unbeaten record in next month’s Las Vegas re-match with Maidana, he says: ‘God has blessed me with an unbelievable talent, fast feet, fast hands, unbelievable defence and a very, very sharp mind. Hip-hop artists, they come and go. I’m still here.’ Not bad. Under pressure: Mayweather was given a torrid time by Marcos Maidana when they first met last May . Let's do it again: Mayweather and Maidana will meet again in their rematch in Las Vegas next month . But may I suggest a way for the greatest of this time to deliver a rebuke as simple, dignified and damningly effective as when The Greatest Of All Time walked off camera. Mayweather should challenge 50 Cent to sing Frank Sinatra’s My Way on television. My informants in the music industry tell me the sound would be akin to that of a Rottweiler being strangled. Kell Brook has proved to himself how rewarding dedication to boxing can be. By all accounts Sheffield’s successor to Prince Naseem Hamed submitted to a rigorous training regime prior to winning his first world title. The close, hard-fought and thoroughly deserved victory over tough welterweight champion Shawn Porter in America has opened up enriching possibilities for Brook. Before he cashes in big-time against Amir Khan – perhaps at Wembley Stadium next spring – and maybe Juan Manuel Marquez in Mexico, let him not forget all the hard work which has made all this possible. On top of the world: Kell Brook (right) outpointed Shawn Porter to win the IBF welterweight title in Los Angeles . Dedication: Brook has waited a long time for his chance to win a world title and he seized it with both hands . Brook himself is talking about the sacrifices he has made recently. The accolades which are following his gallant victory against the odds should serve as constant reminders that prize-fighting is too short a career for any of it to be wasted on nights out on the town. The Steel City gave this likeable young man a hero’s homecoming from California and Sheffield is where he plans to make a voluntary defence of his title in December. The opponent that celebratory night will not be as formidable as Porter last week – let alone Khan or Marquez next year – but there is too much at stake now for Brook to make the easy mistake of treating anyone lightly. The long-awaited statue of Joe Frazier is fast approaching completion. The figure of Smokin’ Joe poised in the split second after landing the booming left with which he floored Muhammad Ali on his way to winning the Fight Of The Century stands nine-feet tall in the studio of sculptor Stephen Layne. It is now beginning the five-month bronzing procedure prior to an unveiling in Frazier’s home city of Philadelphia next April . A campaign for the real former world heavyweight champion to be thus immortalised followed the erection in Philadelphia of a statue of celluloid boxer Sylvester Stallone. Civil Rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson said: ‘Tell them Rocky was fictitious. Joe was reality.’ VIDEO: Watch the Joe Frazier statue being sculpted ahead of its unveiling next year . Mirror: A statue of Joe Frazier, showing him throwing a left hook against Muhammad Ali, is almost complete . Project: Sculptor Stephen Layne expects the Frazier statue to be ready in April and it will stand in Philadelphia . Several years of fund-raising and political manoeuvring later, that anomaly is about to be corrected. The process was tragically interrupted when the original sculptor died suddenly. Layne, the runner-up in that selection process, took over, admitting that he feels ‘the artistic pressure to create the best piece I can put out there.’ So powerful and commanding is the result that one of Frazier’s daughters was moved to weep when invited to see that statue. No doubt there will be more tears for the late Smokin’ Joe when he takes his eternal place on the site of the old Spectrum arena which he christened with his 1967 victory over Tony Doyle.","Rapper 50 Cent attempted to humiliate former friend Floyd Mayweather .

"He hasn't yet appeared on the family's famous TV show, but Prime Minister David Cameron is actually a long-lost Kardashian, new research has found. The Tory leader is the 13th cousin of reality star Kim, according The Global Family Reunion, a project that hopes to show how the whole of humanity is distantly related. The connection is not quite close enough to see the PM star alongside Kim's sisters on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, but genealogists say that the Cameron and Kardashian lines do cross on a large enough family tree. The pair are just one of a number of unlikely celebrity connections, which also show that the Queen is eleventh cousins, four times removed, with socialite Paris Hilton, and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is the 20th cousin of pop star Prince. Scroll down for video . The big link-up: Research has shown that we are all related, as these celebrity connections show .

Jacobs, a New York author who describes himself as 'your cousin', is . asking people to join his campaign and discover their own famous . relatives. He told MailOnline: 'I got into the idea after a man contacted me out of the blue after reading one of my books and told me that he had worked out that we were related. 'I was expecting him to ask me to wire $10,000 into his bank account but in fact he told me of a movement of people who are putting together these huge family trees.' Using genealogy websites that, similarly to Wikipedia, are reliant on users' input, Mr Jacobs and his group now aim to build a family tree of the entire human race. As well as the Kardashian-Cameron . connection, which links to the 17th Century Welsh politician, the 4th . Baronet of Margam, Sir Edward Mansel, Mr Jacobs has discovered he is . 'cousins' with a number of famous people. Family: The family tree charts show David Cameron and Barack Obama to be 13th cousins . The Queen, right, and U.S. socialite Paris Hilton are 11th cousins, four times removed, according to the tree . He said: 'I've contacted a number of people I've found out I'm related to, including Daniel Radcliffe, George HW Bush and Ricky Gervais. 'They are often amazed when I tell them all the other people they are connected to. Daniel Radcliffe was pleased to hear he is related to poet Allen Ginsberg, who he once played in a movie, and George Bush was happy when I told him he is related to George Clooney, who is he a big fan of.' The validity of some family connections is questionable and Mr Jacobs has said he is skeptical of the links when there are more than 50 people involved. But he hopes that the project will send out a message that everyone is related to everyone else. He said: 'It may sound a bit corny, but I hope for the first time in history we realise we are actually one massive family and perhaps we'll start treating each other with a bit more respect.' A celebration of The Global Family Reunion will be held in June next year on the site of the 1964 New York World's Fair, now home to the New York Hall of Science. There will presentations, activities and speeches - and what Mr Jacobs hopes will be the largest family photo in history.","The Queen related to Paris Hilton, according to massive heritage project .

"CLICK HERE TO READ RIATH AL-SAMARRAI'S INTERVIEW WITH THE PUSKAS AWARD NOMINEE . Stephanie Roche will go head to head with James Rodriguez and Robin van Persie on Monday evening as she aims to win the prestigious Puskas Award for best goal. The Republic of Ireland international's stunning volley for Peamount United against Wexford in October 2013 has made a shortlist of three at the FIFA Ballon d'Or ceremony. Her brilliant effort will be up against two goals from the World Cup in Brazil - Rodriguez's fine volley for Colombia against Uruguay and Van Persie's diving header in Holland's win over Spain. Stephanie Roche poses for a portrait ahead of the FIFA Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich on Monday . Roche was photographed in Albi, France by Sportsmail photographer Andy Hooper after her nomination . Roche plays for French Division One team ASPTT Albi after moving from Peamount . Stephanie Roche controls the ball as she shields off a defender during the game in 2013 . Roche flicks the ball away from the defender and up into the air . Roche waits for the ball to drop before volleying it, as the defender tries to stop her . Roche's incredible goal was captured on camera by her manager while she was playing for Peamount United . Roche's effort flies into the top corner of the net, leaving the Wexford keeper no chance . Since her wonder goal, Roche has moved on to play professionally for French club ASPTT Albi . Roche shows her ball skills as she poses for pictures in the dressing room of her French team . Roche would be the first female winner of the Puskas Award . Age: 25 . Current club: ASPTT Albi . Previous clubs: Stella Marris (2007), Dundalk City (2007–2009), Raheny United (2009–2011), Peamount United (2011–2014) International: 28 caps/4 goals for  Ireland . Roche's goal - which was captured on camera only because the Wexford manager arranged to have the game filmed - saw her control a cross with her back to goal, flick the ball over a defender and then volley home. Roche would become the first woman to win the award if she beats off competition from Rodriguez and Van Persie in a public vote which will be conducted via FIFA.com and France Football. Roche, 25, told Sky Sports News: 'It is always a good step to see women nominated for the Puskas Award and this is obviously the first time one has been in the top three. James Rodriguez's stunning strike against Uruguay has made the Puskas Award shortlist . Robin van Persie's diving header against Spain at last summer's World Cup is a strong contender . 'I am obviously proud as a woman but I am just proud as a footballer to be recognised at this level and for FIFA to see it as a good goal.' It is thought only 95 spectators saw the goal live but it has since earned millions of views on the internet. It raised her profile and she has since moved on to play professionally for French club ASPTT Albi. She said: 'With this goal I had more interest. I came on trial and it worked out. I think the goal kind of helped but I don't think it was the making of it!' STEPHANIE ROCHE . PEAMOUNT UNITED vs Wexford Youths (Bus Eireann National League) - 20 October 2013 . With her back to goal, Steph Roche collects a pass in her stride before unleashing a menacing left-footed volley on the turn. The fact that the ball didn't touch the ground once from the moment Roche touched it makes the strike all the more magnificent. JAMES RODRIGUEZ . COLOMBIA vs Uruguay (World Cup) - 28 June 2014 . James Rodriguez was this year's World Cup top scorer and this strike illustrates why. Facing their South American rivals in the last 16, the Colombia playmaker collected team-mate Abel Aguilar's looping header on his chest from 25-yards out. One touch later the ball is in the back of the net as the 23-year-old swiveled and hit a venomous, dipping volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar. ROBIN VAN PERSIE . Spain vs HOLLAND (World Cup) - 13 June 2014 . One of the iconic moments from this summer's World Cup as Holland thrashed the holders Spain 5-1 in their opening Group B match. Daley Blind hits a raking 40-yard pass intended for Robin van Persie. Running in between two Spain defenders, the Dutch captain meets the flight of the ball with a breathtaking diving header that looped over Iker Casillas in goal.","Stephanie Roche scored a stunning volley for Peamount United  in 2013 .

"With their vibrant colours, pinpoint constellations and what could be brush strokes, these images are reminiscent of a great post-impressionist masterpiece. One photograph shows a beautiful star stream over the South American night sky, which looks like a huge, celestial pinwheel. Another contrasts the fire red mountains against the clear blue sky above. Photographer Kevin Zaouali, 22, shot the ethereal landscapes at the Hornocal mountain range located in northern Argentina, near the Bolivian border. The striking mountains are part of the  Quebrada de Humahuaca valley, a UNESCO world heritage site. A rainbow of eleven different rock layers gives the peaks their distinctive appearance, and the best position for observation is a nearby hill which is located at an altitude of 4,300m. Besides the fantastic natural formation,  you can also see remains of human settlements which are estimated to be 10,000 years old. Tracks, roads and settlements testify to the hunter-gathers, indigenous Omaguacas, Incas and Spanish civilisations that once lived here. The Argentinian photographer said: 'The mountains are magical places.They are a range of wonderful colours and sometimes don't look real. I like to take advantage of the storms, sunrises and full moon nights. The light is very variable and each moment can be unique.' Zaouali, from the Jujuy province of Argentina, takes photographs as a hobby while studying biology.

"They say the dead live on in our hearts and minds - but in one Indonesian province, the deceased continue to walk the earth in a rather more literal, zombie-like fashion. Families in Toraja in South Sulawesi dig up the bodies of their dead relatives before washing, grooming and dressing them in fancy new clothes. Even dead children are exhumed - two of these photos show the skeleton of a baby wrapped in a print dress with a doll laid next to it. Damaged coffins are fixed or replaced, and the mummies are then walked around the province by following a path of straight lines. The ritual is called Ma'nene, or The Ceremony of Cleaning Corpses. According to the ancient Torajan belief system, the spirit of a dead person must return to his village of origin. So if a person died on a journey, the family would go to the place of death and accompany the deceased back home by walking them back to the village. In the past, people were frightened to journey far, in case they died while they were away and were unable to return to their village.

"Health Services Union boss Kathy Jackson has tried to get out of cross-examination at a royal commission, saying she had an affair with the barrister 21 years ago. But the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, disagreed, ruling that a sexual relationship which occurred 21 years ago was irrelevant. In an extraordinary development at the national inquiry, almost an hour was devoted to hearing an application by Ms Jackson to stop union barrister Mark Irving cross-examining her because they had an affair, that ended badly. Scroll down for video . Health Services Union (HSU) whistleblower Kathy Jackson runs the gauntlet of media after an extraordinary day of hearings at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, in which she admitted having had an affair with the union barrister, Mark Irving . 'I had a few too many drinks and went back to his place where we had a sexual relationship’. Union boss Kathy Jackson tried to avoid being cross examined at the building Royal Commission because of an affair with the barrister . Ms Jackson was involved in a fiery exchange with union barrister Mark Irving after having her application fail in trying to stop him being able to cross-examine her at the Royal Commission . In an affidavit, Ms Jackson said that, in 1992, when she was working as an industrial officer at the health union branch in Victoria she met Mr Irving, who was with Maurice Blackburn and Co, the union solicitors at the time. She said the union offices were in Carlton and Mr Irving lived in the suburb and there were Friday night drinks, which they both attended. 'After about eight months, in or about, late 1992 or early 1993 Mr Irving and I had a few too many drinks and went back to his place where we had a sexual relationship,' Ms Jackson said in the document. 'I was at the time married to my first husband, which he knew.' In the affidavit read by counsel for Ms Jackson, she said in the course of the next six to eight weeks she would go back to his place. 'I recall he lived near the cemetery and had a barber's chair in his lounge.' She said she ended the relationship and thought Mr Irving was 'resentful'. Mr Irving left the law firm and became an industrial officer for the national HSU. Ms Jackson said they avoided one another and did not speak. In making the application, David Pritchard, SC, representing Ms Jackson, argued that Mr Irving should be precluded from cross-examining her because 'he now found himself in circumstances that placed an impossible burden on him'. He also argued that, legally, a fair minded person might perceive a bias against Ms Jackson. Michelle Painter, representing the union, said the affair happened 21 years ago and 'It had no relevance, save perhaps a prurient interest to observers of these matters'. Commissioner Dyson Heydon agreed. He said that if Ms Jackson 'really had the fears and beliefs about Mr Irving, that she claims to have, she would have protested at the time when Mr Irving first announced his appearance about her - this was not done'. Mr Irving is leading the union's case against Ms Jackson.","Explosive revelations into the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption .

"Former Bollywood child star Shweta Prasad has been arrested after turning to prostitution . A former Bollywood child star has been arrested in a prostitution raid after admitting she turned to it because she made the ‘wrong choices’ in her film career. Shweta Prasad is best-known for her lead role in 2002 film Makdee at the age of 11 where she played a young girl captured by a witch. The 23-year-old was arrested in Hyderabad, India, on Sunday after becoming involved in the sex trade. In a statement to police the actress revealed that she had been lured into prostitution after roles in Bollywood films dried up and she ran out of money. She said: ‘Wrong selections in [my] career made me run out of money. It became difficult to meet my day-to-day expenses. ‘When some people encouraged me to do prostitution, I did so to earn some money. There are many struggling heroines who are linked to this business. ‘There is no other alternative but I repent for the mistake’. A number of people were also arrested in the raid including a Mumbai businessman. Inspector P Murali Krishna of Hyderabad’s Banjara Hills police station said they are currently treating Ms Prasad as a victim. He said: ‘We have arrested the actress. We are treating her as a victim and she’s been sent to a rehabilitation home. ‘We have arrested the person who exploited her and we are investigating if there are other girls been forced into the racket.’ It has been reported that the actress has since been sent to a rescue home run by the women and children welfare department, where it is believed she will stay for three months.

"Uniting: Pope Francis has said atheists who are good are redeemed by Jesus in a homily urging that people of differing beliefs work together . Pope Francis has said atheists who are good are redeemed by Jesus in a homily urging that people of differing beliefs work together. The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics made his comments at the morning Mass in his residence - a daily event where he speaks without prepared comments. He told the story of a Catholic who asked a priest if even atheists had been redeemed by Jesus. 'Even them, everyone,' the Pope answered, according to Vatican Radio. 'We all have the duty to do good,' he said. 'Just do good and we'll find a meeting point,' the Pope said in a hypothetical conversation in which someone told a priest: 'But I don't believe. I'm an atheist.' Francis's reaching out to atheists on Wednesday and people who belong to no religion is a marked contrast to the attitude of former Pope Benedict. He sometimes left non-Catholics feeling that he saw them as second-class believers. Speaking to the Huffington Post, Father James Martin explained Pope Francis' homily. He said: 'Pope . Francis is saying, more clearly than ever before, that Christ offered . himself as a sacrifice for everyone....  rarely do you hear it . said by Catholics so forcefully, and with such evident joy. 'And in this . era of religious controversies, it's a timely reminder that God cannot . be confined to our narrow categories.'

"Guarding the Queen’s home is a serious and solemn duty. So it’s a good thing Her Majesty was not around to see this soldier apparently pirouetting on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. In his red tunic and bearskin, the Grenadier Guard was filmed seemingly trying to ease the boredom of his two-hour shift with a series of remarkably elegant dance moves. Scroll down for video . Now, how can I relieve the boredom? The soldier muses at his sentry box . His antics delighted tourists but the Army and Ministry of Defence were not amused. He could now face disciplinary action. The Queen was not in residence at the time as she is currently holidaying in Scotland. But a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence confirmed to the Mail last night that they were aware of the film and have launched an internal investigation. She said: ‘Anyone who is found to fall short of the Army’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action.’ Initial enquiries have suggested that the film is not a hoax. The three-minute clip was posted online last month and appears to have been filmed recently as a notice advertising the annual Summer Opening of the palace’s State Rooms can be seen in the foreground. How about a twirl@ Ridle on shoulder, he launched into a pirouette . It shows the solider, dressed in his red tunic and bearskin with its white Grenadier plume, attempting to alleviate the boredom of his two-hour guard shift with a series of silly stunts. Marching up and down, he first bends down to pick up something from the gravel forecourt which he then puts in his pocket. He then proceeds to walk very slowly – freezing at one point – before launching into a comical speed walk. On his next turn he pretends to polish his guard box with his knuckles as walks past. The antics do not end there, however, as the soldier walks with a hip-swinging strut before launching into his tour de force: a series of three, remarkably elegant, pirouettes - not once but twice. A group of English tourists can clearly be heard laughing in the background, marvelling at the guardsman’s antics. One child says: ‘Look at him spinning. That’s really silly. Do you think he will get told off for it by the policeman?’ Strictly not allowed: Dancing on duty, the guard turns his back . He then retreats to his box but not before he gestures a thumbs-up to what appears to be his fellow guardsman on the other side of the portico, scratches his nose and leans theatrically to one side. Although the footage is hugely amusing, a military source said senior officers would take a dim view of the soldier’s slapstick. ‘He is there to guard Buckingham Palace not provide horseplay for tourists,’ said one yesterday. It is likely that he will be either confined to barracks or see his pay docked. The Grenadier Guards – motto: Honi soit qui mal y pense, Shame Upon He Who Thinks Evil Of It – was formed in 1656 by the exiled King Charles II and are stationed at Wellington Barracks in London. It is one of seven regiments that make up the Household Division, which has provided The Queen (or King’s) Guard since the 17th Century. Four sentry guards are posted immediately outside the palace when the Queen is residence, which is reduced to two when she is at Windsor Castle or holidaying on one of the estates. Well, that livened up the day: Back at the sentry box . A sentry will be on duty at their post for a two hour period. Every 10 minutes he comes to attention, slopes arms and does a march of 15 paces across the area of the post. Each sentry will do this four to five times before halting. He will then shoulder his arms and stand ‘at ease’. Orders for sentry duty read out before each two-hour ‘tour of duty’, make it clear that: ‘You may not eat, sleep, smoke, stand easy, sit or lie down during your tour of duty.’ Members of The Queen’s Guard not simply ceremonial soldiers, however. As well as providing sentries day and night, they also patrol the grounds of the Palace. Like many of their fellow regiments, the Grenadier Guards are also professional infantry soldiers deployed on operations across the globe. In a statement the Army told the Mail yesterday: ‘We are aware of the video. Anyone who is found to fall short of the Army’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We have no comment to make. It is a matter for the Ministry of Defence and his regiment.’","Grenadier Guard filmed busting moves while guarding Buckingham Palace .

"Happy Sindane, pictured in 2003, has been found dead on a street, apparently stoned to death . A man who once claimed to be a white child enslaved by a black family has been found murdered, apparently stoned to death. Happy Sindane was found dead yesterday in the village of Tweefontein, having been 'severely assaulted', said police. No arrests have been made and there are said to be no known motives for the killing. Spokesman Leonard Hlathi said: 'People who were passing by spotted a body that was lying on the streets at Tweefontein. 'There was stones found at the scene. It seemed as if he was stoned to death.' In 2003, Sindane walked into a police station near Pretoria and claimed he had been kidnapped from a white family 12 years before and had been living in a black township. Sindane, then 16, said he was abused and forced to live outdoors tending animals. He put out an international appeal to find his real parents but a four-month enquiry that year established that Sindane's birth name was Abbey Mziyaye and that he was the son of a black domestic worker, Rina Mzayiya. The court found his father was probably a white man, Henry Nick, who employed Mzayiya in 1983, the year of their son's birth. His black family said they had taken in an unwanted child, left with them by his mother, and treated him as one of their own. Sindane was hit by a minibus and a car after lying down in a road in 2004, reported SAPA. It was not known why he was in the road. The same year, he appeared in front of magistrates in Pretoria after allegedly throwing stones to break a taxi window but the charges were later dropped. Happy Sindane (left, in 2003 and right, at his home in Dark City, Mpumalanga in December 2007) claimed he had been kidnapped from a white family and had been living in a black township . Sindane was 16 when he said he had been kidnapped, abused and forced to live outdoors tending animals . According to IOL News, Sindane's cousin Thomas Kabini, who lived with him in the village of Tweefontein, said he was 'in good spirits and happy' the last time he spoke to him on Thursday. He said: 'I went to identify his body. His head was badly hurt. The rest of his body seemed unharmed.' He said no funeral arrangements have been made. Jacqui Mofokeng, one of the trustees of the Happy Sindane Trust, which was set up with money from Dulux after they used his picture without permission, said Sindane was a 'troubled boy'. The court found Sindane's father was probably a white man, Henry Nick, who employed his mother Rina Mzayiya in 1983, the year of their son's birth . She said she last spoke to him two years ago. She said: 'At the time he was working at a car dealership in Benoni. I asked him to give me the details of the dealership and the owner assured me he would look after Happy.' Mofokeng said most of Sindane's family had died and he was living with the relatives of his former foster mother Betty Sindane. She said: 'Not knowing who you are and where you fit into society is not an easy task for anyone'.","Happy Sindane hit headlines in 2003 claiming to have been kidnapped .

"Michael Adebowale pictured after the killing of soldier Lee Rigby . A senior member of a notorious South London gang linked to the main suspects in the Woolwich murders has given a vivid insight into their drift towards extremism. Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, grew up on the periphery of the Muslim-dominated Woolwich Boys. The 300-strong group, which controls the local drugs trade and is made up of mostly Somalis, has long been the target of extremists seeking to exploit members’ psychological vulnerability. ‘They see our qualities of passion and heart as attractive,’ said the 22-year-old gang  member, Yousef. ‘Many of the boys come from war-torn communities and have witnessed real pain and suffering and consequently have no fear. At the same time some, like me, will eventually question what they have done, what they are doing with their lives, the hopelessness of it all. When a brother is down I can see it in his eyes. ‘While most do not follow a radical agenda they are still susceptible to the jihad preachers. I have heard about some Woolwich Boys falling victim to these people and going off to fight in places such as Somalia.’ He said Adebowale was linked to the gang in a ‘low-level way’ adding: ‘He wasn’t a hardcore guy; he was quiet and shy. I’ve seen the other Michael wandering around Woolwich as if sleep-walking, but I don’t think he was directly involved. But he was immersed in what was going on around him. You can’t escape it. ‘When I saw him talking on TV with blood on his hands I thought, “You idiot, you fool.” It was like he was a robot who had been activated and another man’s words were coming out of his mouth.’ Yousef described how the two suspects grew up against a backdrop of violence, fear and ‘hopelessness’ and said the crossover between criminal gangs and Islamist groups has increased in recent years. ‘It is easy for preachers to pick off boys. They offer them a way out of violence when they are at their weakest. Many of us, though, like the warmth we get from Islam, the brotherly love. People might find that strange as I’ve led a bad life. ‘But I did operate under certain rules. Never hurt anyone who is innocent and don’t involve children in what we do.’ Notorious: A senior member of the Woolwich Boys, Yousef, has revealed how the Muslim-dominated gang has been targeted by extremists . Growing up in nearby Charlton, Yousef joined the gang at the age of 16. ‘I never knew my father, but if I’d had him in my life it is most likely that I would never have got involved with the Woolwich Boys,’ he said. Instead, he became rapidly immersed in violence. ‘My thing was robbing drug dealers,’ he said. ‘We’d set up a deal to buy a kilo of skunk [around £6,000]. We’d do this two or three times. Then the next time, once we’d got trust, we’d ask for five kilos – and this is when we’d rob them at knifepoint. Then we’d sell it to the more senior members for between £3,000 and £5,000. ‘At first, the biggest change being in the Woolwich Boys brought to my life was the girls. Girls of 16, 17, 18 – who wouldn’t have looked at me before – were coming up to me saying they wanted to lose their virginity. It was because I was a Woolwich Boy, a respected individual. The girls were mesmerised. Some would go as far as hiding drugs and guns for you.’ By the time he was 19, Yousef was driving a 7-series BMW and earning £4,000 cash a week.  ‘Then things began to change. I lost three friends who were stabbed and shot and it made me question what I was doing. I didn’t want it for my kid brother, I’ve always kept him on a different path. He’s in school and my sister is in college and they are fine. ‘My mum wasn’t pleased when I became a Muslim, she thinks it’s rubbish. But at least she knows I’m too strong-minded to get picked up by the extremists.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Senior gang member, Yousef, gives vivid insight into life on troubled estate .

"Wife number four: George Galloway outside his London home with new wife Putri Gayatri Pertiwi . Politician George Galloway married for the fourth time yesterday - but it was not long before the father of his third wife accused the MP of being a 'bigamist'. The 58-year-old tied the knot with Dutch-born consultant Putri Gayatri Pertiwi - who is 31 years his junior - in a civil ceremony at the Houses of Parliament on Saturday. But the father of Mr Galloway's third wife, Rima, declared he was in fact still married to his daughter. 'Rima is still legally his wife according to Muslim law, which British law does not accept. He has committed bigamy,' Haschem Husseini told The Sun. A spokesman for Mr Galloway confirmed the couple married yesterday and vehemently denied the MP had committed bigamy. When asked about the accusation that the Bradford West MP is still married, his spokesman replied: 'Are you suggesting he is a bigamist? I having nothing more to say, whatsoever.' The Respect leader's first marriage was to his childhood sweetheart Elaine, in 1979. The couple were married until 1987 and had two children together. He next tied the knot to Palestinian Dr Amineh Abu-Zayyad in 1994 in a Muslim ceremony, and in 2007 he married Lebanese-born Rima. They have a four-year-old son Zain, and a second son, Faris, who was born at the beginning of this year. In April, Rima launched a bitter verbal assault when it was announced that Mr Galloway had gone through a ceremony with Putri, 27, in Amsterdam. At that time, the Lebanese . researcher said: ‘We are still married under Islamic law. There is a . misconception you can have up to four wives in Islam – but it’s just not . true in the 21st Century. ‘It may have been the case hundreds . of years ago as a way of looking after women in the villages who had . lost their husbands, but it doesn’t exist now. ‘It’s just a stupid, man-made thing in some Arab countries. It’s not true. Under Islamic law we remain married.’ The new Mr and Mrs Galloway will continue to live in the £1.4million home they share in Streatham, South . London.

"A gang of Muslim women who attacked a passer-by in a city centre walked free  from court after a judge heard they were ‘not used  to being drunk’ because of their religion. The group – three sisters and a cousin – allegedly screamed ‘kill the white slag’ as they set upon Rhea Page as she waited for a taxi with her boyfriend. Miss Page, 22, was left with a bald patch where her hair was pulled out in the attack and was left ‘black and blue’ after suffering a flurry of kicks to the head, back, arms and legs while motionless on the pavement. Attack: Three of the young women can be seen setting upon Rhea Page, 22, in the centre of Leicester. Despite leaving her traumatised, they were handed suspended sentences .

Maxamed, 28, and Hibo Maxamed, 24, and their 28-year-old cousin Ifrah . Nur each admitted actual bodily harm, which carries a maximum sentence . of five years’ imprisonment. But Judge Robert Brown gave them . suspended jail terms after hearing mitigation that as Muslims, the women . were not used to being drunk. The Koran prohibits Muslims from . consuming alcohol, although Islamic teachings permit its use for . medicinal purposes. After the sentencing, Ambaro Maxamed . wrote on her Twitter account: ‘Happy happy happy!’, ‘I’m so going out’, . and ‘Today has been such a great day’. Yesterday Miss Page, a care worker, called the sentence ‘disgusting’ and said the gang deserved ‘immediate custody’. ‘It’s no punishment at all,’ she said. ‘And for them to say they did it because they were not used to alcohol . is no excuse. If they were not supposed to be drinking then they . shouldn’t have been out in bars at that time of night. ‘Even after the police came and they all ran away, one of them came running back to kick me in the head one last time. ‘I honestly think they attacked me just because I am white. I can’t think of any other reason.’ Miss Page was treated for bruises and . grazes after the attack in June last year as she walked to a taxi rank . with boyfriend Lewis Moore, 23, in Leicester city centre. At the time she worked caring for . people with autism and learning difficulties but gave up the job after . repeated absences because of stress and flashbacks.

"A British teenager has been sentenced to eight years in prison over the stabbing death of a British soldier during a nightclub brawl  in Cyprus. David Lee Collins, 18, from London, was stabbed to death after a fight broke out in a nightclub in the popular resort of Ayia Napa last November. The court said that Mohamed Abdulkadir Osman, originally from Somalia, but living in London, was provoked and 'lost . self-control' when he pulled out a switchblade and fatally stabbed Mr Collins. Tragic: David Lee Collins, 19, was stabbed to death after a fight broke out in a nightclub in the popular resort of Ayia Napa last November - the photo on the right is thought to be last image taken of him before his death . The three-judge bench said that Collins had confronted Osman and his friends after being punched by an unidentified nightclub patron, raising a clenched fist at the group and telling them 'Are you bad men?' - a phrase which the court said is interpreted in Britain as a challenge to a fight. The court said that it was a group of friends with Collins - all of whom were soldiers - that started the fight. The court also took into account that there was no premeditation on 19-year-old Osman's part since he didn't previously know the victim, had fully cooperated with investigators and had apologised to the victim's family. Sentenced: Mohammed Abdulkadir Osman, 20, originally from Somalia but believed to have been living in London, admitted manslaughter at a court hearing in Larnaca on April 22 and returned for sentencin . David Collins' mother Lisa Minott, arrived at  the court in Larnaca, Cypru  clutching a large handbag with a painted portrait of her son . But it discounted Osman's consumption . of alcohol as a mitigating factor and noted the fact that he had the . switchblade on him inside the club 'carried the possibility of harm . being caused.' Police searching Osman's hotel room . at the time turned up marijuana, two brass knuckles and 11 switchblades . that the defendant said he bought from a local store as souvenirs to . take back home and give to friends. Charges against two other teenagers, who were both 17 at the time of the stabbing, were dropped. Mr Collins, from the 2nd Battalion, . Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, died from a 'ruptured heart caused by a . sharp instrument', according to a post-mortem. Killed while off-duty: Tributes have been paid to Mr Collins, second left, on Twitter and a Facebook page has been set up in his memory . Party: Mr Collins (fourth from right in black and red cap) was stabbed to death after a fight broke out in a nightclub . Scene: The stabbing took place during a fight between four soldiers and three British tourists at this nightclub . He was stationed at the British Army base at Dhekelia but was due to fly to Afghanistan the day before he died and his battalion's mission was delayed. Mr Collins' mother Lisa Minott and her sister - along with members of his regiment - were in court to hear the sentencing. MoD spokeswoman . Connie Pierce said the attack took place in an area of the eastern . Mediterranean island that British soldiers are told to avoid because of . previous incidents. After the rape and murder of Danish tour guide Louise Jensen by British servicemen in 1994, the centre of Ayia Napa - a clubbing resort with a reputation for sex, drugs and violence - was declared off limits to soldiers by military top brass on the island. About 3,000 British military personnel are stationed in Cyprus at bases retained after the former British colony gained independence in 1960.

"A football club faces a probe by the FA after it treated a former player differently because he was black and 'refused to pay his medical bills'. Gillingham Football Club was ordered to pay retired striker Mark McCammon £68,000 in August 2012 after he sued the club over his sacking in 2011. He claimed staff victimised the club's black players and treated them differently to their white team mates. Mark McCammon, right, sued Gillingham Football Club for £68,000 in August 2012 over his sacking in 2011. Chairman Paul Scally, left, and the club have been charged by FA over his dismissal . McCammon, 36, said the League One club tried to 'frustrate him out' by refusing to pay private medical bills that would help him regain fitness following a serious injury. Instead, he claims he was offered the same operation on the NHS rather than privately, a move he described as 'completely out of character' for a Football League club, and that he was fined two weeks' wages when he paid a visit to a private consultant. In contrast, the 6ft 2in striker said a white team-mate was flown to Dubai for treatment by an eminent physiotherapist at the club's expense. The former Barbados international player also claimed he was docked wages when he failed to turn up for training during heavy snow during 'treacherous' driving conditions, while some white players were told they were not required. McCammon said he confronted manager Andy Hessenthaler about being 'racially intolerant' over the decision to order him in during snow and claimed Hessenthaler reacted angrily. The striker was subsequently ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and later received a letter saying he was dismissed. McCammon, who signed for Gillingham for £2,500 a week in 2008, told an employment tribunal in 2012 he had been put 'through hell' McCammon, who signed for Gillingham for £2,500 a week in 2008, told an employment tribunal in 2012 he had been put 'through hell' and had not been given an answer over why he was treated differently to other players. Dubai-based Gillingham chairman Paul Scally described McCammon's claims as being made 'maliciously and without foundation', adding that the club had not had to deal with an allegation of racism in 18 years. The club lost an appeal last September and the original decision was upheld and they had to pay compensation to McCammon, who also played for Doncaster Rovers and Millwall. Now Gillingham chairman Paul Scally and the club have been charged by the FA over the dismissal of the player. The FA claim Gillingham FC breached FA Rule E3 by 'failing to act in the best interests of the game, and/or bringing the game into disrepute by committing an act of race victimisation' by dismissing Mark McCammon. Both Gillingham and Mr Scally have until November 14 to respond.","Gillingham Football Club was ordered to pay Mark McCammon £68,000 .

"America's richest Indian tribe has 99.2 per cent unemployment -- and it's all voluntary, tribal leaders boast. There's little need for any member of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Tribe to work. Each adult in the 460-person American Indian nation receives more than $1million a year - for doing nothing. The payouts are the windfall from lucrative casinos and resorts that the tribe runs on its reservation in Scott County - about 45 minutes southwest of Minneapolis-St Paul. Wealthy: Members of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Tribe are the richest American Indians in the nation, thanks to $1million annual payouts to each member . The New York Times reports that the payments, $84,000 a month to each adult, were revealed in divorce filings involving one of the tribal members. The Shakopee keep modest homes on the reservation, but nearly every driveway sports at least one luxury car. Tribal members usually have multiple homes and have been known to take vacation for months at a time. Many choose to take up expensive hobbies. They are big game hunters and breeders of thoroughbred horses. All of the children attend private schools. Lucrative: The Mystic Lake Casino Hotel includes five restaurants, a 600-room hotel, convention center, 2,100 seat showroom, 8,350 seat amphitheater and a golf course. It's a remarkable turnaround for a group once hunted down by US Army soldiers -- before finding refuge in Minnesota. The source of the almost unbelievable . wealth is a pair of luxury casinos and resorts the tribe has built on . its land - drawing tens of thousands of gamblers from the . Minneapolis-St Paul region, and across the state. The Mystic Lake Casino Hotel is build on a man-made lake. It includes five restaurants, a 600-room hotel, convention center, 2,100 seat showroom, 8,350 seat outdoor amphitheater and a top-notch golf course. The theater venue competes for major touring acts with venues in Minneapolis and St Paul. Weak: Some tribal elders worry that the money is making the Shakopee complacent and soft . The Mystic Lake Casino is the fourth-largest Indian casino in the nation. Combined with the tribe's Little Six Casino, revenues reportedly make up the lion's share of Minnesota's $1.4billion gambling profits, according to the Times. The tribe has used the money to generous donations to other Indian tribes - lending money and giving grants. It's always used the money to gain clout in the community. The Shakopee people have donated more than $243million since 1996 and lent out nearly $500million. Swimming in cash: Between Mystic Lake, pictured, and a second casino, tribal revenues are thought to be nearly $1.4billion . Among the major grants is a $12.5million gift to the University of Minnesota to build a new football stadium and endow scholarships for American Indian students. Not everyone sees the windfall of money as good. Some tribal elders worry the $1million salary is making members complacent. 'Why dig a hole when you don’t need to dig it -- when you can pay someone to dig a hole?' Keith B Anderson, the tribe’s secretary and treasurer, told the Times. 'Instead of budgeting a dinner and movie, you can go to dinner and a movie and have dinner again and see another movie, but you can’t see enough movies and dinners to spend all your money.'","Payouts coming out of the money the Shakopee Mdewakanton Tribe makes through its highly profitable casinos .

"The man who assassinated Dr Martin Luther King Jr has been seen for the first time on footage newly restored 45 years after the civil rights leader's death. The fascinating, historical clips from July 1968 show James Earl Ray in handcuffs sitting on an airplane in Tennessee after being extradited from London. He had fled the U.S. following the fatal shooting of Dr King three months earlier at a Memphis motel. The grainy, black and white film has been released this week by Shelby County Register's office after being cleaned up using digital technology. Scroll down for video . Unseen: Martin Luther King assassin James Earl Ray is read his rights by a police officer on the plane after being returned to Tennessee to face trial over the civil rights leader's murder .

Watched: Ray is examined by a prison doctor in Tennessee in 1968 three months after Dr King was shot at a Memphis motel . Ray is filmed wearing a checked shirt and black-rimmed glasses while being roughly handled by police officers with his arms behind his back in handcuffs. He is also seen sitting on the airplane on the runway as he is read his rights by a police officer. Ray was filmed being moved to a prison cell and later removing his shirt as he is examined by a prison doctor. Also on the restored videotape are potential jurors for Ray's trial being filmed saying their names. Ray never faced trial because he pleaded guilty to the murder. Shelby County Register told NBC, who helped restore the footage, in a statement: 'It is believed that the personnel using the equipment were learning how to operate this technology as they recorded. 'As a result, the footage is not always as clear as we are accustomed to seeing today.' Killer of the dream:  James Earl Ray was sentenced to 99 years for the death of Martin Luther King but later said he was not guilty of the assassination . Surrounded: Ray is marched to a prison cell by police officers and guards in 1968. He was sentenced to 99 years for Dr King's murder and died in prison in 1998 . Glimpse of history: Also among the freshly restored clips are brief interviews with potential jurors if a trial of James Earl Ray had gone ahead. The prospective jurors were all men with only two African-Americans . James Earl Ray, a convict who had escaped from Missouri State prison, was arrested at Heathrow Airport in London two months after Dr King was shot dead. Ray was attempting to flee the UK on a fake Canadian passport headed for Africa. He was extradited to Tennessee and charged with Dr King's murder. He confessed on March 10, 1969 but later changed his story and said he had falsely confessed. Ray was sentenced to 99 years in Tennessee state penitentiary without his case going to trial. He spent the rest of his life trying to achieve a jury trial but was never successful. There have long been conspiracy theories surrounding Dr King's death. In 1997, the civil rights leader's son Dexter met with Ray and publicly supported his father's killer receiving a retrial. Ray died in prison of liver failure following complications from kidney disease, aged 70 in 1998.

"Archaeologists have uncovered cave art providing evidence that hunter-gatherer children may have attended a form of prehistoric pre-school. Researchers have revealed that 13,000 years ago, prehistoric children created art in caves with the help of their parents. A conference on the Archaeology of Childhood at Cambridge University, starting today, will reveal the latest research into art made by children as young as three in one of the most famous prehistoric decorated caves in France. Archaelogists found evidence of thousands of lines - a simple form of art or decoration known as finger flutings - made by people running their hands down the soft surfaces of the walls and roofs of the many galleries and passages that make up the complex . Stunning drawings of mammoths, rhinoceros and horses have been found within the five-mile 'Hundred Mammoths' cave system in Rouffignac. Experts recently developed a method of identifying the age and gender of those behind the drawings, with one of the most prolific artists being a prehistoric girl aged five. Some of the drawings by children were found high up on walls, meaning they could have been helped up there under the watchful eye of an adult. Also evident are thousands of lines - a simple form of art or decoration known as finger flutings - made by people running their hands down the soft surfaces of the walls and roofs of the many galleries and passages that make up the complex. Archaeologist Jess Cooney said: 'Flutings made by children appear in every chamber throughout the caves even those that are a good 45 minutes' walk from the entrance - so far, we haven't found anywhere that adults fluted without children. 'Some of the children's flutings are high up on the walls and on the ceilings, so they must have been held up to make them or have been sitting on someone's shoulders. Archaeologist Jess Cooney said: 'We don't know why people made them. We can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals, for training of some kind, or simply something to do on a rainy day' Some of the drawings by children were found high up on walls, meaning they could have been helped up there under the watchful eye of an adult. Cave woman: Archaeologist Jess Cooney . 'We have found marks by children aged . between three and seven-years-old - and we have been able to identify . four individual children by matching up their marks. 'The . most prolific of the children who made flutings was aged around five - . and we are almost certain the child in question was a girl. 'Interestingly, of the four children we know at least two are girls. 'One . cavern is so rich in flutings made by children that it suggests it was a . special space for them, but whether for play or ritual is impossible to . tell.' Archaeologists first realised that children had produced some of the finger flutings back in 2006. Fieldwork carried out earlier this year by Cooney and Leslie Van Gelder of Walden University, U.S., shows just how young they were. Though impossible to date accurately, the images found deep inside the Rouffignac caves - a network created by river systems - are likely to be at least 13,000 years old. The flutings also raise questions over age identity - whether children were seen as we are now - and apparent gender equality. Finger fluting also appears in caves in France, Spain, New Guinea and Australia. Cooney said: 'We don't know why people made them. We can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals, for training of some kind, or simply something to do on a rainy day. 'In addition to the simple meandering lines, there are flutings of animals and shapes that appear to be very crude outlines of faces, almost cartoon-like in appearance.'","Experts can identify the age and gender of those behind the drawings, with one of the most prolific artists being a prehistoric girl aged five .

"Facing questions: Ged Fitzgerald, chief executive of Rotherham council from 2001 to 2003, will be questioned over what he knew about the abuses . Rotherham council's former chief executive is to be questioned by his current employer over what he knew about the town's sex abuse scandal. Ged Fitzgerald, now head of Liverpool council, presided in Rotherham for a two-year period between 1997 and 2013 when the sexual exploitation of 1,400 girls at the hands of Asian gangs went uninvestigated. And during his tenure from 2001 to 2003, council figures allegedly wiped evidence of sexual abuse cases from computers as the Home Office compiled a report on the town. Mr Fitzgerald will become the first of the senior councillors in charge during the scandal to face interrogation. In a statement, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said he intended to raise his concerns about the report with Mr Fitzgerald. He said: 'I note and am concerned that the Jay Report criticises Rotherham council for not taking the earlier Heal Report (often referred to as the Home Office Report) seriously, and will discuss these matters with Mr Fitzgerald as soon as possible. 'I will be seeking clarification as to whether he was aware of the Heal Report. 'Further, I also note that the Jay report is non-specific and does not name people. I will be seeking further clarification from Alexis Jay and others at Rotherham about Mr Fitzgerald's role.' Mr Anderson added that he backed calls for a public inquiry into the scandal, which saw more than 1,400 children abused over a 16-year period from 1997 to 2013. He said: 'In conclusion, I want to reassure people in the city of Liverpool that child protection and safeguarding our children is of paramount importance to me and this administration. 'We will always put our children's safety first.' It is understood that Mr Fitzgerald, also a former chief executive of Lancashire County Council, is away on holiday. The news comes after allegations emerged that Rotherham council staff seized and destroyed damning evidence of the hidden child sex abuse scandal. Officials are said to have ordered a raid on the town's young people's service centre in 2002 and seized nothing but the details of victims, offenders, and grooming cases that would have contributed to a landmark report in 2000-1, The Times reported. It came shortly after senior police and council staff became aware of a researcher’s draft report revealing evidence of a child sex scandal. According to the Times, the ‘raid’ was carried out at the office of Risky Business, the council’s specialist youth service, which offered help to vulnerable teenage girls. The researcher’s work was supposed to form part of a Home Office project on child sexual exploitation (CSE) in a number of towns. The chapter on Rotherham remains unpublished. Professor Alexis Jay’s report, published this week, stated that the 2002 draft research ‘contained severe criticisms of the agencies in Rotherham involved with CSE’. It alleged indifference and ignorance by senior managers and that ‘responsibility was placed on young people’s shoulders’ rather than the abusers’. Professor Jay’s inquiry team was told by several sources that the researcher ‘was subjected to personalised hostility at the hands of officials’ and was unable to complete her work. But the content that senior officers objected to was later found to be ‘largely accurate’. At one point during her ordeal the unidentified researcher put her concerns in writing, Professor Jay’s report revealed. A meeting was then held with the police district commander and senior council officials and she was told ‘never to do such a thing again’. She was suspended for ‘an act of gross misconduct’ for including confidential data in her report, but was re-instated when it was proved she had done nothing wrong. Senior officials ‘requested’ the researcher ‘remove or rewrite several sections’ of her report deemed to be ‘inaccurate or exaggerated’. But she changed nothing and sent her research to the Home Office on her last day of work. Cover-up? The interrogation comes after it emerged Rotherham council officials allegedly destroyed evidence . Professor Jay’s inquiry found the treatment of the researcher was ‘deeply troubling’. The Times claimed the ‘raid’ took place over the weekend after the draft was first seen and that every file forming the basis of ten case studies in the report was taken away. Rotherham's current chief executive Martin Kimber today said he could find no evidence of an alleged raid by council staff on one of their own offices to remove evidence of the extent of the town's sex abuse crisis. Mr Kimber said: 'The alleged 'raid' on the Risky Business office is not something that I am aware of and having made appropriate checks within the council, I am unable to find anyone who recognises this series of events as they have been presented to us. 'Similarly, I have been unable to find any reference within the Alexis Jay report to the alleged incident and have no other independent means of corroborating the allegations that are being put forward. If further information is made available which enables me to do so, I would be happy to look into it.' The allegations came as South Yorkshire's chief constable spoke out about the report for the first time. David Crompton said the findings made painful reading and vowed to 'fully investigate' the abuses. He said: 'The report into CSE (child sexual exploitation) in Rotherham laid bare the failings of South Yorkshire Police over a number of years. 'This made for painful reading. However, I am determined that we will use the findings of the report to ensure the mistakes of the past are not repeated,' said Mr Crompton. 'Regret': David Crompton, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police (right with Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright), vows to fully investigate the report's findings which 'made for painful reading' The chief constable said he was seeking a meeting with Professor Jay 'to fully understand her detailed findings and properly address any concerns'. 'I interpret this as a sign of confidence amongst victims that the force, as it stands now, will take these matters seriously and investigate them fully,' he added. Meanwhile, officials including embattled children's services chief Joyce Thacker, who was still refusing to resign last night despite mounting evidence of her extraordinary complacency during a period of horrific and widespread child abuse. Just five months ago she insisted that 'a sense of proportionality' was needed about the problem. Even after several critical reports into the council's failure to deal with child abuse, Mrs Thacker told the Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board that she did not want it to focus entirely on child abuse. Minutes of a meeting in March this year show she 'reiterated' that the council, social services and police 'need to retain a sense of proportionality with regard to child sexual exploitation'. Mrs Thacker, who earns £115,000 a year, said the issue made up just '2.3 per cent of safeguarding work in Rotherham', adding: 'Although it is a very important issue, child neglect is a much more significant problem in the borough.' Professor Alexis Jay's report said: 'This is not an appropriate message for senior managers to give.' Earlier an Australian abuse victims' advocate called on Rotherham's former director of children's services to step down from her current job in that country. Andrew Collins said Dr Sonia Sharp's role as a deputy secretary in the state of Victoria's education department, which she has held since 2012, was inappropriate. She has been publicly backed by her employer. Dr Sharp, who worked in Rotherham from 2005 to 2008, apologised to abuse victims yesterday and said staff were aware that 'many' children were at risk. She said she wished she could have done more but insisted she had helped improve things during her tenure. But Mr Collins told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Knowing that she is involved in the education department in the state of Victoria as a deputy secretary, I thought this woman should not be involved, have any involvement, around children. 'She should either resign or be stood down from her position. 'It is not good enough to say 'I'm sorry'. There's families and children whose lives will forever be altered and if somebody could have stopped that or done anything about that, it is just not good enough.'","Ged Fitzgerald was chief executive of Rotherham council from 2001 to 2003 .

"A father slit the throat of his three teenage daughters in an ‘honour killing’ after they were raped by Gaddafi loyalists during the siege of the port city of Misrata. Allegations of the shocking executions are contained in a report by the respected Physicians for Human Rights group into war crimes and atrocities in the embattled city, which faced two months of being cut off from the rest of Libya. The father is said to have carried out the ‘honour killings’ because of his humiliation and shame at the rape of the sisters – aged 15, 17 and 18 – in Tomina, on the outskirts of Misrata. The victims were not named. Shattered: Human rights investigators interviewed survivors of the siege of Misrata and revealed widespread war crimes by Gaddafi's men . The horrific story was one of a number to emerge from Misrata after the group sent in a team of interviewers in June to catalogue human rights abuses just after Libyan forces expelled Gaddafi loyalists. Researchers from PHR were also told that Gaddafi's men: . The human rights group, which is based in Boston, concluded that there was widespread evidence of war crimes during the siege. Hundreds of civilians died in the siege: Here seven members of the Al Nour family - including Abdul Mufta, eight, and Nadia, five - are buried after their house was bombed by Gaddafi's troops . 'Four eyewitnesses reported that . (Gadhafi) troops forcibly detained 107 civilians and used them as human . shields to guard military munitions from Nato attacks south of Misrata,' said the report, which was released today. 'One father told PHR . how (Gadhafi) soldiers forced his two young children to sit on a . military tank and threatened the family: ""You'll stay here, and if Nato . attacks us, you'll die, too.""' Richard . Sollom, who was the lead author on the report, concluded that no one . had evidence that rape was widespread - but the fear of sexual assault . was endemic. 'One witness reported that . (Gaddafi) forces transformed an elementary school into a detention site . where they reportedly raped women and girls as young as 14 years old,' the report noted. Distress: Iman Al-Obeidi claimed she had been raped by Gaddafi's men when she rushed into the Rixos hotel in Tripoli . It added that it had found no evidence to confirm . or deny reports that Gaddafi troops and loyalists were issued . Viagra-type drugs to sustain their systematic rapes. Researchers also heard reports of suspected honour killings - including the murder of the three sisters by their father. But PHR also noted that 'some in . Tomina have stood up against this practice, including a well-known sheik . who has publicly advocated for raped women and girls to be seen as . brave and bringing honor to their families'. The group obtained copies of military orders as evidence that Gaddafi ordered his troops to starve civilians in Misrata, while pillaging food caches and barring locals from receiving humanitarian aid. Physicians for Human Rights only investigated the abuses committed by Gaddafi forces. The timing of their visit, and its focus on Misrata, meant that PHR was not in a position to comment on allegations of rights violations by the Libyan rebels or by Nato, the group said. It said NATO should investigate any credible claims made against the allied force that supported the rebels, largely through thousands of bombing sorties. PHR particularly raised the issue of medical neutrality in war time, accusing the Gaddafi forces of attacking hospitals, clinics and ambulances, and preventing doctors from reaching or treating injured civilians. Last week, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said it had collected evidence that 'strongly suggests that Gaddafi government forces went on a spate of arbitrary killing as Tripoli was falling.' Meanwhile, Amnesty International, which is based in London, also accused pro-Gaddafi guards of raping child detainees, but added that Libyan rebels are abusing children and holding migrant workers as prisoners. All three major human rights groups have called on both sides to respect prisoners - and beyond that, to build a post-Gaddafi Libya. 'Individual perpetrators need to be brought to justice and held to account for their crimes,' Sollom said. 'And as we've seen historically in places like South Africa and Bosnia and Rwanda, it's a cathartic experience for the country, and a necessary one, to move forward.'","Human rights group uncovers widespread war crimes by loyalist forces .

"Arrested and facing deportation: David Duke . Former Ku-Klux-Klan leader and white supremacist David Duke has been arrested in Germany hours before he was due to speak at a far-right gathering. Duke, who is a rabid anti-Semite who has been speech-making as a VIP guest to right-wing groups across Europe for the past two years from a home he owns in Austria, is now fighting deportation to the U.S. At a time of heightened tensions in Germany following a spate of killings by neo-Nazis, it is no surprise the country wants shot of the 61-year-old after he was seized by police last Friday near Cologne. He has been released and is now out on bail while deportation formalities are completed. Duke promised on his website to fight deportation, throwing in a plea to supporters to send him money as he was now engaged in a 'desperate fight.' 'While most of you will be getting ready for the warmth and love and friendship and family of Christmas, I will be far from home fighting the good fight,” he wrote. 'It will require a lot of time and effort.' Police in Cologne said Duke is 'obliged to leave German territory without delay.' But they have now instigated formal proceedings to have him kicked out. The arrest seems linked to Duke's expulsion from Czech Republic in 2009, following his detention there on suspicion of denying the Holocaust, a crime in many European countries, but especially in Germany. Ralf Wohlleben is pictured taking part in a demo by Germany's right extremist . NPD party in Jena, Germany, in August. He has since been arrested in . connection with recent neo-Nazi killings . The Cologne police statement said that Duke 'was not entitled to stay in Germany' because of a travel ban against him in another, unspecified European country. Duke, a former neo-Nazi who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. presidency in 1988 and 1992, served a year in prison in 2003 and 2004 after pleading guilty to tax fraud and stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from supporters to pay gambling debts. He routinely calls the Holocaust of six million Jews during WW2 a 'myth' and offers support to fellow travellers who like to deny the existence of the Nazi gas chambers. In the statement on his website, Duke added that German authorities had arrested him in order to silence his 'message of heritage and freedom. German police yesterday announced the arrest in a raid in Jena, in the former eastern Germany, of the right-wing extremist Ralf Wohlleben, in connection with the neo-Nazi murders which have terrified the country. The 36-year-old is being held on six counts of accessory to murder and one of attempted murder for his alleged involvement with the far-right terrorist organisation known as the National Socialist Underground. Investigators have said they are looking at about 10 people in total with regard to the killing of eight people of Turkish origin and a Greek man between 2000 and 2006 and a policewoman in 2007. It also is being investigated in connection with several other possible hate crimes and a string of bank robberies over the past decade. Prosecutors said the group is believed linked to two bombings in Cologne targeting foreigners in 2001 and 2004, which wounded more than 20 people.","Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke vows to fight extradition .

"With thousands of pearls, silken layers and a 25ft train, it is arguably the most famous wedding dress in the world. But for much of the past decade, Diana, Princess of Wales’s stunning gown has been lost to the nation – instead travelling the globe on a lucrative tour. Today, exactly 17 years after her death, it can be revealed that the heirloom is finally returning home to her sons, William and Harry. Scroll down for video . Stunning: Diana wearing the Emanuel wedding dress. Her iconic bridal gown is being returned to her sons William and Harry, seventeen years to the day since their mother's tragic death . Entrusted: Lord Spencer, pictured right, says Diana’s will stated that her belongings were to be ‘looked after’ by him until both of her sons, pictured left with their mother in 1990, turned 30 . Family estate: For two months every year it was held at Althorp, the family's Northamptonshire estate (pictured). For the rest of the year the exhibition moved from country to country on a lucrative tour . Until now, the dress has been in the possession of Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer, who placed it at the centre of an exhibition called Diana: A Celebration. For two months every year it was held at Althorp, the family’s Northamptonshire estate. For the rest of the year the exhibition moved from country to country. Most recently, it has been at the Cincinnati Museum Center in America, where visitors were charged £15 to see the gown, along with 28 other dresses and other personal artefacts. The exhibition closed two weeks ago after six months there. Lord Spencer says Diana’s will stated that her belongings were to be ‘looked after’ by him until both of her sons turned 30, at which point they would transfer into their possession. Prince Harry will be 30 in two weeks’ time. Over the years, proceeds from the exhibition have generated more than £1 million for the Diana, Princess  of Wales Memorial Fund, but it is thought this represents only a small margin of revenue. And it has been reported that Princes William and Harry have been unhappy over what has been viewed as the commercialisation of their mother’s death. Iconic: With thousands of pearls, silken layers and a 25ft train, it is arguably the most famous wedding dress in the world. It was exhibited along with 28 other dresses and personal artefacts . Visitors to the exhibition are invited to buy an array of Althorp-related souvenirs, including a £25 silk-bound copy of the address her brother gave at her funeral. Buckingham Palace confirmed to The Mail on Sunday that the dress and some of Diana’s other cherished personal possessions were ‘being returned to the Princes’. There have been calls for the items to be put on display at Kensington Palace, where William and Kate have their official London home, but no decision has yet been made. Last night, Alan Berry of the  Diana Appreciation Society said: ‘We think it a good suggestion that the dress be put on display along with other artefacts in Kensington Palace. If part of the takings were to go to one of Diana’s charities,  that would be a bonus.’ New home? There have been calls for the items to be put on display at Kensington Palace, where William and Kate have their official London home, but no decision has yet been made . Diana’s dress was created by designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel. Mr Emanuel told The Mail on Sunday: ‘That wedding gown has certainly earned its keep – it has been around the globe many, many times. 'I think more people abroad have seen this wedding gown than British people. Princes William and Harry will have to think long and hard about it, but it would be the perfect vehicle to earn money for their charities to show it over here. ‘What’s extraordinary is that after so many years people are still talking about this gown.’ Today, the flag will be flown at half mast at the Althorp Estate,  with the family marking the anniversary privately.","Diana's gown has been in the possession of her brother, Earl Spencer .

"Health officials are working to stem panic over the number of patients being tested for Ebola after reports put the number as high as six. Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan reported that one man was being tested for the deadly disease after arriving at the hospital early on Monday  with ‘a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms'. His test results are expected today or Wednesday. On Tuesday, CNN and The New York Post reported that six people were being tested for Ebola in New York City. Mount Sinai confirmed today that this was not the case. Scroll down for video . Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City confirmed on Tuesday that it had tested just one male patient for the Ebola virus (stock picture) A statement today from Mount Sinai read: 'Contrary to a recent report in the New York Post, there is only one patient currently at Mount Sinai being tested for the Ebola Virus Disease. 'The patient, who remains in isolation, was stable overnight and in good spirits. No other patients have presented with similar symptoms and travel history to West Africa.' Mount Sinai’s Chief Medical Officer Jeremy Boal said on Monday night that it was 'very unlikely' that the patient was suffering from Ebola. Officials are working to assuage fears over Ebola which has no known cure and is fatal in about 90 per cent of patients. It also emerged on Tuesday that a 46-year-old woman had been tested for the disease in Columbus, Ohio but the results were negative. She had gone to hospital after returning from a trip to West Africa. The second U.S. Ebola patient, Nancy Writebol, is wheeled into Emory in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday by two medics wearing protective biohazard suits . Another patient was isolated at a hospital in New York City last week after arriving on a flight from West Africa and showing symptoms found in Ebola patients. That man was screened at Kennedy International Airport last Wednesday and taken to Bellevue Hospital. He had a fever but within a day the fever had gone and it became clear he did not have Ebola. 'We are on a heightened state of alert,' said Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. 'We have instructed all 11 of our hospitals to follow C.D.C. guidelines and be on the lookout for Ebola-like symptoms.' On a live report from Atlanta where two confirmed cases of Ebola are now being treated, CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta said on Tuesday: 'There have been about a half a dozen patients who have had their blood tested because of concern, those particular patients their stories were not made public. 'I’m not sure if that’s because of heightened concern by the hospital or what that means exactly.' Two American aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia are currently being cared for at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia in a specially-sealed unit. The second patient, Nancy Writebol, was stretchered out of an ambulance today by medics in biohazard suits. The 59-year-old missionary from North Carolina arrived in a specially-converted ambulance at 1pm on Tuesday after landing on a chartered jet from Liberia. Mrs Writebol will be treated along with fellow missionary Dr Kent Brantly, 33, in a special quarantine wing at the hospital. She is reportedly weak but showing signs of improvement. Dr Brantly is also reportedly showing signs of improvement. Both aid workers are receiving an experimental drug so novel that it has never been tested for safety in humans. There are fears in other parts of the world as more cases of Ebola are reported. Saudi Arabian health officials are testing a patient suspected of contracting the disease, Nigerian officials said eight people have symptoms and one patient has been reportedly quarantined in the UK. The Ebola death toll has reached 887, with more than 1,600 confirmed cases in what is the worst outbreak ever recorded.","Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City forced to quell reports that six more patients were being tested for Ebola today .

"Ukrainian demonstrators demanding their government forms closer ties with the EU have forced riot police to retreat today after a pre-dawn raid on their protest camp. In a blow to the authority of President Viktor Yanukovych after nearly three weeks of rallies against his rule, security forces were eventually forced into a humiliating retreat amid cheers from the demonstrators after the ranks of protesters swelled. It followed a day of international pressure on the embattled leader, with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland visiting the pro-EU protesters in Kiev and telling the president the attempted police crackdown was 'inadmissable'.

Several dozen were injured in the early hours when riot police and interior ministry special forces moved against the demonstrators who have occupied Kiev's Independence Square in anger at the rejection of a landmark EU pact. 'We have not won the war yet but we've decisively won this battle. The authorities are panicking,' said protester Anton Kulyk. 'We will continue to stand up for our country.' The police move sparked unprecedented international criticism of Yanukovych, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressing 'disgust' at the crackdown. Thousands of officers began moving in on the camp in the Ukranian capital Kiev after a stand-off lasting several weeks, which escalated on Sunday when demonstrators beheaded a statue of the Soviet Union founder Vladimir Lenin. Tents were town down in Independence Square, barricades were dismantled and scuffles broke out. Protesters in sub-zero temperatures shouted 'Shame! Shame!' and sang the Ukranian national anthem as an Orthodox priest read prayers.

Heavily armoured riot police, their masks steaming up from their breath, grip a protester by the hood of his parka and drag him along the ground after officers moved in to break up demonstrations . Riot police hold a protester who has tried to fashion his own riot gear by sellotaping short planks of wood to his forearms . The clashes were roundly condemned by the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. 'The . United States expresses its disgust with the decision of Ukrainian . authorities to meet the peaceful protest in Kyiv's Maidan Square with . riot police, bulldozers, and batons, rather than with respect for . democratic rights and human dignity,' he said in a widely-circulated . statement. 'This response is neither acceptable nor does it befit a . democracy. 'The United States stands with the people of Ukraine. They deserve better.' Protests began in earnest last month . when President Viktor Yanukovych backed away from a pact that would deepen the former . Soviet republic's economic ties with the EU. Surveys showed the pact was supported by nearly half the country's people - but it was opposed strongly by Russia, which has either controlled or . heavily influenced Ukraine for centuries. Moscow has worked aggressively to . derail the deal and lure Kiev into its own economic group by . offering price discounts and loans, as well as imposing painful trade . restrictions. Climax: Riot police (foreground) march on the tent city in Kiev tonight after a protest lasting several weeks . Anger: The tented camp in Kiev's Independence Square, where protesters tore down a statue of the Soviet Union founder Vladimir Lenin on Sunday night and planted an EU flag on the base where it stood since 1946 . Force: Riot police line up in Kiev. It was claimed they were trying to clear the streets, not the square itself . Tent city: The trashed belongings of pro-European integration protesters near Independence Square in Kiev . As protestors wore bright orange helmets to protect themselves from police, one undressed to his waist, got down on his knees and shouted 'Stop this ... We are one people!' Some poured water on the ground in front of the barricades so it would freeze and make the ground slippery for police. Others shouted 'We will stand' and an opposition lawmaker laid down on the snow try to block a police vehicle. Several . protesters were injured in tonight's clashes. Some policemen helped . injured activists up from the ground and moved them away. Kiev . police said authorities were merely trying to clear the streets leading . to Independence Square, but not to remove the main encampment, the . Ukrainian Interfax news agency reported. Opposition . leader Vitali Klitschko, who is the reigning world heavyweight boxing . champion, urged Ukrainians to rush to the centre of the capital to . defend democracy. 'We will say no to a police state, no to a dictatorship,' he told the protesters. The . confrontation tonight unfolded as EU foreign policy chief Catherine . Ashton and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland were in the . city to try and negotiate a solution. After she was earlier cheered by crowds on a visit to the protest site, Baroness Ashton said she was saddened at the violence used to dislodge protesters from their camps. She said in a statement posted on Facebook: 'I was among you on Maidan [Independence Square] in the evening and was impressed by determination of Ukrainians demonstrating for European perspective of the country. 'Some hours later I observe with sadness that police uses force to remove peaceful people from the centre of Kiev. The authorities didn't need to act under the coverage of night to engage with the society by using police.' Slippery: The demonstrators pour water onto the ground in the hope it will turn into ice, slowing down police . Camp: The pro-EU settlement in Ukraine's capital, where some protesters have been injured since last month . Conflict: The scuffles between police and protesters in Kiev tonight have lasted several hours . Protesters wore orange helmets to protect themselves from what they allege has been police brutality . Embattled: President Viktor Yanukovych said he was continuing to form a deal with the EU . Aiming to defuse the crisis, Yanukovych called yesterday for demonstrators who had previously been arrested to be released. He . has vowed the country still wants to be integrated with Europe, but . only in Spring if the EU can offer better financial terms. He insisted the deal as it stands . could cost the economically struggling nation billions in lost trade with . Russia, which has used trade threats to try to keep Ukraine in its . orbit. Meanwhile Ukraine is in dire economic straits - it . has been in recession for more than a year, and the government is in . desperate need of foreign funding to avoid bankruptcy. Protesters have demanded more decisive action. Soon after Yanukovych spoke in a televised broadcast, opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk told demonstrators at the square that protest leaders were still insisting on their key demands. They said Yanukovych should fire the government, appoint a new one committed to signing an association agreement with the EU, release all the arrested protesters, and punish all police who beat peaceful demonstrators. Riot police have twice previously dispersed demonstrators with clubs and tear gas, beating some badly enough to send them to intensive care. Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's first president, said: 'Law enforcement must know that it is forbidden to beat people. There can be no justification.' Yanukovych, however, insisted both sides were guilty. The President, in a televised meeting with Ukraine's three previous presidents, said he asked the prosecutor-general to ensure the release of some of the protesters - those who haven't committed grave crimes and who have children or families. However, police would continue to investigate the actions of the freed protesters, he said. 'We want to achieve conditions that satisfy Ukraine, Ukrainian producers, the Ukrainian people,' Yanukovych said in the televised meeting. 'If we find understanding and if such compromises are reached, the signature will be put.' Hunger: A protester takes a break to eat some food as the demonstration draws into the early hours . Community spirit: Volunteers descended on the pro-EU camp to make tea for the chilly activists . Riot policemen stand guard at the main avenue in the direction of the camp in Independence Square . Destruction: Tents and belongings which were dismantled at the camp, which has lasted several weeks . The EU's enlargement commissioner, Stefan Fule, said yesterday the EU was prepared to offer better terms. Kravchuk and his successor, Leonid Kuchma, hinted that Prime Minister Mykola Azarov's resignation could help resolve the crisis, but Yanukovych did not comment on that. At a separate event, Kravchuk called for a nationwide round table involving both authorities and opposition members, but it was unclear when or how such a meeting would take place. Yanukovych said he would renew talks with the International Monetary Fund about getting a bailout loan. But some analysts were sceptical that Yanukovych's pro-EU talk was genuine, believing he was still trying to play off Russia against the bloc. 'I am not sure these comments will be taken that seriously after the fiasco in the run-up to Vilnius,' where the agreement was to have been signed, said Tim Ash, an emergency markets analyst with London's Standard Bank.","Police tore down tents and barricades and scuffled with protesters .

"When Maura Horton's husband, former college football coach Don Horton, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, she felt helpless to aid him - until he came to her with a problem she could tackle: his clothes. Don Horton hadn't been able to do up his shirt after training one day. That's when Maura Horton, 43, knew she had the solution to at least one of the obstacles Parkinson's had thrown at Don, 55. MagnaReady came into being as a blueprint on Maura's . computer. The former children's clothing designer used her skills to . make a dress shirt with strong magnets embedded behind the buttons, dispensing with fiddly buttonholes. Husband help: Maura Horton wanted to find a way to make dressing easier for her husband Don Horton after he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease . MagnaReady was created by Maura Horton for her husband, but her design has proved to be helpful to many other people suffering neurogenerative diseases like Don Horton, as well as people who have suffered strokes, arthritis, and even people with war injuries. 'Getting dressed shouldn't be a stressful task - living with a disability is hard enough,' says Maura Horton. 'There were a lot of challenges or changes [Don] might have been going through that I couldn't help,' she told Fox News. 'But that was one I thought I would try to get to the bottom of it.' The hardest button to button: With no fiddly buttons or buttonholes, the MagnaReady is a great solution for people with limited mobility or impaired motor skills - it's also a great-looking shirt . Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's, and proceeds in a similarly slow yet destructive way. According to MichaelJFox.org, one in 60 people over the age of 60 in the U.S. will be diagnosed with Parkinson's. It was four years ago that Maura Horton got the idea of how to help her husband get dressed. 'I knew something was wrong when he came home,' she told CNN. 'I thought maybe it was a bad game.' Dignity: Not being able to do up his shirt buttons after a game made former football coach Don Horton embarrassed and frustrated - and his wife knew she could help . Entrepreneur: Maura Horton operates MagnaReady from her small home office in North Carolina . Don explained that a player, Russell Wilson who now plays for the Seahawks, had done up his buttons for him in the locker room because his fine motor skills were failing and he couldn't do it himself. 'I didn't want him to feel that way ever again,' said Maura. From a small home office in Raleigh, North Carolina, Maura has sold 1,000 MagnaReady shirts. Don Horton left football coaching in 2012 and since then has been helping out with his wife's business. The couple are hoping the shirts will eventually be stocked in department stores; for now MagnaReady shirts can be bought at MagnaReady.com and some online distributors. Parkinson's: Well-known sufferers of the disease Muhammad Ali and Michael J Fox . Pope John Paul II suffered with Parkinson's, and it was suspected artist Salvador Dali had the disease, too . Shirt tales: The packaging of a MagnaReady shirt . The shirt looks like any other dress shirt, only its button and buttonholes are purely decorative. Behind the buttons are embedded magnets that Maura has tested for just the right strength. Too weak and the shirt will open easily, too strong and the shirts would be hard to take off. They also have to be specially coated to prevent rusting in the wash. MagnaReady shirts currently come in blue or white and retail for $59.99. Maura Horton has more products in the works. Don Horton has recently undergone brain surgery in a bid to improve his Parkinson's symptoms. As a result, he is wearing a battery pack similar to a pacemaker and can't wear the MagnaReady shirt in case it interferes with its functions. It's a new challenge for Maura and she thrives on helping her husband. 'I could fall on my face,' she told News Observer. 'But at least I’ll bring some awareness to the disease.'","Maura Horton's husband Don Horton has Parkinson's disease and has trouble doing up his shirt buttons .

"Stephanie Roche has spoken of her pride after being nominated alongside two of the world's most high-profile players for FIFA's goal of the year. The Republic of Ireland women's international's stunning volley for Peamount United against Wexford in October 2013 has made a shortlist of three for the Puskas Award at the FIFA Ballon d'Or ceremony. Her brilliant effort will be up against two goals from the World Cup in Brazil - James Rodriguez's fine volley for Colombia against Uruguay and Robin van Persie's diving header in Holland's defeat of Spain. Stephanie Roche controls the ball as she shields off a defender during the game in 2013 . Roche flicks the ball away from the defender and up into the air . Roche waits for the ball to drop before volleying it, as the defender tries to stop her . Roche's incredible goal was captured on camera by her manager while she was playing for Peamount United .

Roche's goal - which was captured on camera only because the Wexford manager arranged to have the game filmed - saw her control a cross with her back to goal, flick the ball over a defender and then volley home. Roche would become the first woman to win the award if she beats off competition from Rodriguez and Van Persie in a public vote which will be conducted via FIFA.com and France Football. Roche, 25, told Sky Sports News: 'It is always a good step to see women nominated for the Puskas Award and this is obviously the first time one has been in the top three. James Rodriguez's stunning strike against Uruguay has made the Puskas Award shortlist . Robin van Persie's diving header against Spain at his summer's World Cup is a strong contender . 'I am obviously proud as a woman but I am just proud as a footballer to be recognised at this level and for FIFA to see it as a good goal.' It is thought only 95 spectators saw the goal live but it has since earned millions of views on the internet. It raised her profile and she has since moved on to play professionally for French club ASPTT Albi. She said: 'With this goal I had more interest. I came on trial and it worked out. I think the goal kind of helped but I don't think it was the making of it!' Roche will discover if she has won the award at a ceremony in Zurich on January 12. STEPHANIE ROCHE .

"Premier League star Gael Clichy claims he was racially abused by a fan who threw a banana onto the pitch during a match. A police probe is to be launched into Sunday's incident during Manchester City's friendly showdown at Limerick FC. After his side’s 4-0 win at Thomond Park, an angry Clichy vented his frustration on micro-blogging site Twitter. He said: 'How sad to see ""bananas thrown on the pitch"" tonight... Knowing people around the world need food. #nowordsforthis.' Claim: Gael Clichy tweeted saying bananas were thrown on to the pitch in a friendly for Man City . Anger: Clichy took to Twitter to vent his frustration at the alleged throwing of bananas on to the pitch . The glamour friendly with the Premier League champions was a major coup for the First Division side. More than 20,000 fans turning up to see some major stars of world soccer. But the incident involving French international left-back Clichy blighted the tie. Limerick FC has pledged to identify the person involved. In a statement, the club said: 'Limerick FC officials met with Thomond Park officials and local gardaí this afternoon, to continue attempts to identify a person that threw an offensive object onto the playing field during the friendly game on Sunday night, August 5. 'An incident of this nature is completely unacceptable and is fully condemned by Limerick FC and Thomond Park. 'CCTV footage is still being analysed and when the offending party is identified appropriate action will be taken. 'It is deeply upsetting that the actions of one individual have soured the experience for all those in attendance.' At the double: Dzeko scored twice in City's 4-0 win over the Irish side . Over the line: The Premier League champions ran out comfortable winners over Limerick on Sunday . An official Garda investigation has not yet begun as they require someone to make a formal complaint before they can open a probe. However, sources claim gardaí are confident of identifying the person involved and that Limerick FC will then submit a formal complaint if the culprit's identity is revealed. Last night, a spokesman for Manchester City said that they did not want to comment on the incident. The club has also not made an . official complaint, nor has Clichy. However, a source within the club . said that they were satisfied with how Limerick FC was dealing with the . matter. Ged Grebby, chief executive of Show Racism the Red Card, was both surprised and disappointed to hear of the allegations. He said: 'The fact it's coming in in friendly games is worrying, and in different countries. 'Ireland actually has a good . reputation. We have a Show Racism the Red Card campaign in Ireland which . does a lot of good work, and it's similar in Holland. 'The Dutch and Irish fans have good . very good reputations, and they kept those reputations intact throughout . the Euros, so these incidents are quite surprising.' Show Racism the Red card calls for bans of three to five years for spectators found guilty of racially-motivated offences. The source said: 'We have every confidence that they will take the right steps. They've been excellent in the way they've handled it.' Yesterday, there was fury in the city at the incident and that negative publicity had made headlines across the world. Former mayor of Limerick, Joe Leddin, said: 'I'm disappointed. It's very regretful but I’d like to think, if it's true, it's a one-off. I don't recall any incident like it before. 'It leaves a sour taste in the mouth of the player and probably the Manchester City team.' Sunday's match was expected to generate €6million for the mid-west economy. During the match Edin Dzeko scored twice as Roberto Mancini's side cruised to victory. Captain for the day Samir Nasri got the game off to a lively start when a high clearance from the French midfielder evaded the entire Limerick back line, almost putting out-of-favour Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz through on an open goal. City broke the deadlock on the half hour when a weaving run from James Milner created space for the England international to roll the ball into the path of Dzeko, who bundled home from close range. The visitors doubled their lead on 42 minutes when defender Dedryck Boyata received the ball from youngster Denis Suarez and calmly slotted home. And Dzeko found himself clear of the Limerick defence just a minute later, firing low and hard to put the Premier League champions 3-0 up. The second half was played out at a more steady pace, only reigniting on 78 minutes when 21-year-old Italian midfielder Luca Scapuzzi fired home a fourth for City. Limerick began to press as the game wore on but were unable to find a way through a solid defence. Manchester City play Chelsea in the Community Shield clash this weekend.","Premier League star takes to Twitter to vent his anger at the alleged abuse .

"Carlo Ancelotti has a 500million euro problem: his gold-plated diamond-studded super squad is heavy on attacking forward flair and light on midfield runners. As one of his many predecessors, Carlos Queiroz complained in 2003: 'I have a lot of concert pianists but no one to move the piano.' Gareth Bale could be his answer. The Real Madrid coach will have had two weeks to think about how best to give his team back its balance by the time Real Madrid play the local derby with Champions Atletico this weekend and the Italian coach is considering using Bale in a slightly more withdrawn role to compensate for the loss of Angel di Maria. New role: Gareth Bale (left) looks set to move into central midfield as Real Madrid try to replace Angel di Maria . Stamina: Carlo Ancelotti believes Bale has the engine required to be the driving force in the Madrid side . (4-3-3): Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Modric, Kroos, Bale, James, Benzema, Ronaldo. Ancelotti wants to retain Real Madrid’s 4-3-3 shape – the formation that helped them win the Champions League last season – but whereas last season Di Maria had the engine to play on the left of the three and protect the left back, James Rodriguez already looks as though he is struggling in the role. Bale’s phenomenal stamina has been displayed many times in his career from his days as a marauding left-back, to the taxi for Maicon nights, to the lung-busting goal scored with a run from the half-way line in the last minutes of the Kings Cup final, so Ancelotti is weighing up the possibility of playing Bale on the left of a midfield three with Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. The plus side for Bale will be that he ends up back on his favoured left side and Ancelotti believes Bale like Di Maria will not only be capable of doing a job defensively but also be capable of running down the left filling the space vacated by Cristiano Ronaldo as he moves from his starting position on the left of the front three to a more central position. Replacement: Bale look set to slot into Di Maria's position after the Argentine joined Manchester United . Attacking flair: Bale needs to drop deeper to accommodate James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale may well feel moving further from goal is scant reward for his netting 20 times last season but such is life at Madrid that everyone has to be accommodating when a new star arrives. Zinedine Zidane was also shoehorned into a wide-left starting position in the Galaticos team that David Beckham joined in 2003. The Frenchman spent most of the game coming inside to influence the match as left back Roberto Carlos overlapped him. Beckham ended up playing in a holding midfield position in that team because Luis Figo’s name was already written in stone on the right wing. A long term solution to Ancelotti’s problems could be the incorporation of Sami Khedira on the left of the midfield with Bale returning to the top three – last season dubbed the BBC. But a forward line of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano leaves no place for Rodriguez and so that would not completely solve Ancelotti’s dilemma. He needs the right balance to win football matches, but he also needs to keep his president happy after another summer of big signings. History: Zinedine Zidane was shoehorned into a wide-left position after David Beckham joined the Spanish side .","Real Madrid have an abundance of attacking options .

"Bill Cosby has resigned from the board of trustees of his beloved Temple University following a string of sexual assault allegations against him, it today emerged. The 77-year-old comedian and actor, who had been a trustee since 1982, was a frequent visitor, commencement speaker and attendee at basketball games at his Philadelphia alma mater. But on Monday, he stepped down from his role, saying he was acting in the 'best interests of the university and its students'. His resignation was confirmed in a university statement. Scroll down for video . Resignation: Bill Cosby has resigned from the board of trustees of his beloved Temple University following a string of sexual assault allegations against him, it has emerged. Above, Cosby at a Temple commencement . In the statement, first obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Cosby said: 'I have always been proud of my association with Temple University. 'I have always wanted to do what would be in the best interests of the university and its students. As a result, I have tendered my resignation from the Temple University Board of Trustees.' Patrick O’Connor, chairman of the board of trustees, told AP that Cosby does not want to be a distraction to his colleagues. He added that the board 'accepts Dr. Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university'. The resignation is believed to be effective immediately. Speech: The 77-year-old comedian and actor, who had been a trustee since 1982, was a frequent visitor, commencement speaker (pictured) and attendee at basketball games at the Philadelphia-based institution . Chatting: Cosby is pictured stopping to talk with a Temple cheerleader as he makes his way to the sidelines . Mr O'Connor had defended Cosby in a 2005 civil suit filed by a former Temple basketball employee, who accused the star of molesting her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion a year earlier. Cosby, who has been with his wife Camille for the last 51 years, and the woman later settled for undisclosed terms. But since the lawsuit was filed, at least 17 other alleged victims have come forward to claim that the star drugged and sexually abused them in decades past. Show: Cosby, pictured performing during a show in Florida on November 21, said he was acting in the 'best interests of the university and its students' The comedian has strongly denied any wrongdoing and has never been criminally charged. His lawyer has previously called the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and 'discredited'. Cosby's decision to resign from the board of trustees reportedly follows a series of high-level talks by university leaders, many of whom had spoken in support of the Temple graduate. It also follows many other universities' decisions to sever ties with the star, who has donated millions of dollars to numerous academic institutions, and has close links to many others. The University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Cosby got his graduate degrees, recently said it had asked him to step down as honorary co-chairman of its $300 million fundraising campaign. And the Berklee College of Music will reportedly no longer award a scholarship in his name. At Temple, an online petition urging the university to cut ties with Cosby had garnered more than 1,000 signatures by Monday afternoon. Temple trustee Anthony McIntyre said the developments presented a 'no-win situation' for everyone involved at the university, which serves around 38,000 undergraduate and graduate students. 'It's a tragedy for all and I'm sure that he did what he felt was best for the school,' Mr McIntyre said. On Saturday, it emerged that Cosby's management has offered refunds for tickets to his shows at Tarrytown Music Hall in New York this weekend, which the comedian still plans to perform. Despite initially claiming the venue could not afford to refund tickets, a spokesman for Cosby later revealed reimbursements would be possible. Previous dismissal: The University of Massachusetts Amherst, where Cosby got his graduate degrees, recently said it had asked him to step down as honorary co-chairman of its $300million fundraising scheme. Above, Cosby sits beside UMass President William Bulger (left) at a commencement at Boston College . Couple: Cosby, who strongly denies the allegations against him, has been with his wife Camille for 51 years . 'Mr Cosby's management is now allowing for refunds for any patron's (sic) that do not wish to attend the show. Please let me know if I may cancel and refund your order,' the Music Hall box office told ticket holders in an email on Friday, according to Gothamist. A number of other theaters have cancelled Cosby's listing, leaving him with 30 shows until spring 2015. Meanwhile, Netflix and NBC have pulled the entertainer's projects. Among the women to have accused Cosby of assault are Barbara Bowman, who told MailOnline the star drugged and raped her in 1985, when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel (pictured right) said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Angela Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Renita Chainey Hill - The 47-year-old mother-of-three who met Cosby when she was offered a role on Picture Pages in Pittsburgh claimed he would fly her to different cities around the United States and drug her during a four-year relationship. Kristina Ruehli - A New Hampshire grandmother-of-eight, now 71, claims Cosby invited her back to his house for 'party'. She arrived and no one was there. Ruehli alleges that he drugged two bourbons he poured her and she came to when he was on top of her, shirtless. Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner. Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties. Michelle Hurd: The 47-year-old actress, best known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. In a Facebook post this weekend, she described being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things became too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, ""No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened'''. Joyce Emmons: The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault. Lachele Covington: The 20-year-old actress, who’d been an extra on the TV show Cosby, filed a police report in March 2000 against the star, accusing him of making an unwelcome sexual advance. According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed.","Bill Cosby, 77, resigned from Temple University's trustee board Monday .

"A teacher in Brooklyn has won a landslide settlement after she said she was ‘treated like dirt’ by her students, who would throw condoms at her and verbally abuse her. Theresa Reel, who taught at the High School for Legal Studies in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn, said that her former employer punished her for speaking out. Because of her hardships, the city has awarded her $450,000. Treated like dirt: Theresa Reel's complaints fell on deaf ears and instead she was sent a letter chastising her for wearing an 'inappropriate low-cut, V-neck lace top' Ms Reel, 52, filed a lawsuit against the high school in 2008, after she said that her complaints of sexual and verbal harassment fell on deaf ears. She said at the time that she kept quiet for three years ‘because I didn’t have tenure.’ Disgusted: Reed was told by one of the students: 'I've got rubbers - want to party?' The educator told the New York Daily News at the time that she was sent a letter from the Department of Education chastising her for wearing a ‘low-cut, V-neck lace top,’ which they deemed ‘inappropriate attire.’ The principal at the time, Denise Morgan, didn’t listen to her complaints either, Ms Reel said. According to the Mississippi native, when she told Ms Morgan about the inappropriate behaviour from her students, Ms Morgan responded: ‘And how does that threaten you?’ Ms Reel told the Daily News that the time spent at the high school was dreadful. ‘I wasted six years of my life being treated like dirt –less than dirt.’ She said she’s elated that this settlement allowed her to quit her job, which she started in 2005. Schooled? She taught at the High School for Legal Studies in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn . Ms Reel said the things her students told her were horrendous. One allegedly said: ‘I’ve got rubbers – want to party?’ The constant barrage of attacks from her students made her depressed, she said, and at one point she contemplated suicide. In reviews on greatschools.org, School for Legal studies, which has around 750 students, was given a possible 2/10, based on state test results. One former student wrote: ‘As a legal studies student for three years, I find that the school is a non-education experience. It is horrible student and teacher wise.’ Another wrote that they transferred out after freshman year because they didn’t learn anything. And according to performance trends, the math and reading scores for the school’s students are well below the 50th percentile. The student ratio has gradually crept up while the number of full-time teachers has gone down in recent years. City officials declined comment on the case.","Theresa Reel, 52, said she was tormented for six years while teaching at Brooklyn high school .

"On April 29, 2002, a crowd of 711 assembled at the Gladsaxe Stadion in Soborg to watch England face Holland. After 31 minutes, Wayne Rooney picked up the ball off Lee Croft and shuffled it from his left foot to his right before firing into the far corner. It was his first goal representing England and he would score four more on the way towards winning the player of the tournament award. Wayne Rooney (left) in discussion with Roy Hodgson (right) in Brazil 2014 ahead of the World Cup . Rooney celebrates scoring for England at the 2014 World Cup against Uruguay in Sao Paolo . Rooney celebrates scoring for England against Croatia at Euro 2004 with team-mate Paul Scholes (right) Rooney's love affair with England had begun and he wanted to share it with his team-mates. On the night England were eliminated the squad convened for a farewell meal. Then something unexpected happened. After gaining Under 17 coach Duncan Bate's permission, Rooney stood up and produced a piece of paper from his pocket. On it he had written a poem about how much he loved playing for his country. Rooney, along with team-mate James Biggins, recited the poem called When Saturday Comes to a crowd of nearly 30 silent onlookers. 'I think it took most of the group aback,' Bate said. Dressing room convention dictates Bate is not allowed to reveal the full contents of the poem, but it is safe to say there were no rhyming couplets or iambic pentameters involved. But that did not matter. 'Here was a young boy just expressing his love for England in the best format and most succinct manner he could,' said Bate, who has 37 years coaching experience. 'I have never seen anyone stand up and do that before. 'I will never forget it.' Rooney will play his 100th England game as captain of the national side against Slovenia at Wembley . Bate had previously heard good things about a young Liverpudlian in Everton's academy who was running rings around opponents for fun. At first sight, there was little to suggest the teenager who reported for duty just before the championships would go on to earn 99 senior caps before his 29th birthday. 'He didn't stand out, not in terms of the way he dressed or behaved,' Bate says. Once he had seen Rooney in action, Bate's opinion changed. 'His attitude was absolutely first-class,' Bate said. 'He was combative without being over-aggressive and I liked that. 'He was a genuine boy and a genuine footballer.' From then on, Rooney's career looked set to go in just one direction - up. In February 2003 he became the youngest player to earn a senior cap when he came off the bench in the 3-1 defeat to Australia. His team-mates spoke about watching a young Rooney laughing and joking with his international team-mates on the way to the match at Upton Park. He was not fazed by what lay ahead, as he demonstrated when he impressed on an otherwise shambolic night for English football. Steven Gerrard (right) shares a joke with Rooney during an England training session in November 2005 . 'His first touch was top-class,' Sven-Goran Eriksson said. 'Every time he had the ball at his feet you thought something important could happen.' Rooney became England's youngest goalscorer in a qualifier against Macedonia and it came as no surprise when Eriksson named him in his Euro 2004 squad. It was equally unsurprising when Rooney took the tournament by storm, scoring a brace against Switzerland and Croatia. Rooney was front and back page news. Steven Gerrard was not exaggerating when he described Rooney's form as the 'best in Europe'. Eriksson ramped the hype up too much by comparing the 18-year-old to Pele. Soon after completing his £30million move to Manchester United, questions were raised about Rooney's temperament. Eriksson had to substitute a raging Rooney in the first half against Spain after he picked up a booking and threatened to earn a second. Rooney argued with David Beckham and several of the Northern Ireland team during England's embarrassing defeat in Belfast. But Rooney's England career has not been without incident, particularly during the 2006 World Cup . That temper was to cost England at the 2006 World Cup. Weeks after declaring 'the big man is back' following his famous metatarsal injury, Rooney was sent off for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho, although Cristiano Ronaldo played his part in the dismissal of his United team-mate, though. Eriksson said he was '200 per cent' sure Rooney would bounce back from the sending-off, but England did not. They fell into a slumber under Steve McClaren, but Rooney led the fight back under Fabio Capello. With the Golden Generation now a fading force, Rooney was the main man and he thrived under expectation, winning England's Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009. Rooney could not carry his form into the 2010 World Cup though. Again going into the tournament suffering from injury, he failed to score and produced an ill-advised flurry of abuse at England fans following the 0-0 draw against Algeria. The issue of Rooney's temperament again came to the fore when he was sent off for flippantly kicking out at Miodrag Dzudovic in a qualifier against Montenegro in October 2011, which meant he missed England's first two matches of Euro 2012. Rooney scored the winner against co-hosts Ukraine on his return but England went out on penalties for the third time in his international career. Rooney took over as England captain after Gerrard retired from international duty after the 2014 World Cup . Rooney broke his World Cup duck in Brazil last summer, but England crashed out in the group stages. One good thing was to come out of the tournament for Rooney though. His team-mate and close friend Gerrard quit international football and manager Roy Hodgson handed the armband to Rooney. 'It's a great honour. I'm very proud,' Rooney said. Rooney will be even more proud when he walks out with his sons Kai and Klay to earn his 100th cap against Slovenia next week. His career will be tinged with sadness though if he retires without lifting an international trophy.","Wayne Rooney will earn 100th cap for England against Slovenia next week .

"A Texas man was sentenced to more than six years in prison for beating his pet pit bull named Candy with a shovel and drowning her in a pool as punishment for attacking him and ruining his furniture. Robert Prichard, 60, of Mesquite, was convicted Wednesday of a felony animal cruelty charge in connection to his dog's brutal killing in 2013. During his trial, Prichard claimed he struck Candy after she threatened him and his 8-year-old twin boys. Pet killing: Ricahrd Prichard, 60, (left), was sentenced to six and a half years in prison after a jury found him guilty of felony animal cruelty for beating and drowning his pit bull named Candy (right) Brutal end: The pet owner tossed the dog in his backyard pool and then used a net to drown her . ‘I just hit it, hit it, hit it and held it,’ he said from the witness stand, according to Dallas Morning News. ‘And I thought it was unconscious.’ The former dog owner also insisted that he tossed the animal in the pool just to ‘cool her off.’ Prichard testified that he had tried to surrender Candy to animal control in Balch Springs a week before the killing, but the dog was rejected because the 60-year-old lived in a different city. The Mesquite man described Candy in court as 'too dangerous' and 'destructive' for him and his family. Mr Prichard has been raising his sons alone since 2010, when his second wife passed away, the Dallas Morning News' Crime Blog reported. On Friday, a jury panel sentenced Prichard to six and a half years behind bars. Before learning his fate, the 60-year-old man asked for leniency and appealed to the jurors to give him probation. Best of friends: While this photo shows Prichard cuddling with Candy, in court he said the dog was too dangerous and destructive for him . Scars: After his arrest a year ago, the dog owner shared this photo showing Candy's bite marks on his ankle . Rejected: Prichard testified that a week before the dog killing, he had tried to surrender Candy to animal control in Balch Springs, but they would not take her because he lived in Mesquite . ‘I beg your mercy,’ he pleaded. ‘I’ve been in jail. I miss my children. I can’t go back and change anything, I can only go from here forward.’ According to prosecutors, on August 30, 2013, Richard Prichard grabbed a shovel and struck Candy the pit bull multiple times in the head for biting him. He then grabbed the dog and threw her into his backyard pool. As the animal scrambled to get out of the water, Prichard used a pool net to drown her. The frightened animal's struggle was captured on surveillance video, which was shown to the jury during the trial. When questioned by police. Prichard admitted that he was angry at the pit bull for chewing on his lawn furniture. Court documents stated that Prichard answered the door to police covered in blood. ‘I couldn’t get it off my hands. I couldn’t give it away. I had to kill it,’ he said during the trial. Family man: Prichard told the jury he was afraid for the safety of his 8-year-old twins, whom he has been raising alone since 2010 when he lost his wife (pictured) After bonding out of jail in September 2013, Mr Prichard shared a photo on his Facebook page showing his ankle bearing what appeared to be Candy's bite marks. ‘Sorry I made wrong decision that I was forced into due to all destruction, risk for my boys, and ASPCA cost,’ he wrote. The defendant has been behind bars since June for violating the terms of his bond. The 10 months he had spent in jail will be counted towards his sentence. Prichard’s attorney, Kent Starr, said he plans to appeal the sentence. Prosecutors originally had asked for a 10-year sentence for Prichard, whom they called a 'ticking time bomb waiting to go off.'","Richard Prichard, 60, from Texas, has been convicted of felony animal cruelty in August 2013 dog killing .

"It may look like a cross, but lines scratched into a cave wall could be proof that Neanderthals were more intelligent and creative than previously thought. The cross-hatched engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. The find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and their extinct cousins shared the capacity for abstract expression, according to a team of scientists who studied the site. But is it art? Lines scratched into a cave could be proof that Neanderthals were more intelligent and creative than previously thought and some experts claim they are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art . Experts examined and described the grooves in a rock that had been covered with sediment in the study published in the PNAS journal. Archaeologists had previously found artefacts associated with Neanderthal culture laid over the top of the artwork, suggesting that the engravings must be older, said Professor Clive Finlayson, director of heritage at the Gibraltar Museum. 'The production of purposely made painted or engraved designs on cave walls is recognised as a major cognitive step in human evolution - considered exclusive to modern humans, he said. 'Here we present the first known example of an abstract pattern engraved by Neanderthals from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar. 'It consists of a deeply impressed cross-hatching carved into the bedrock of the cave older than 39,000 years. 'Most of the lines composing the design were made by repeatedly and carefully passing a pointed lithic tool into the grooves - excluding the possibility of an unintentional or utilitarian origin. The art, discovered inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar (marked) is believed to have been made by Neanderthals because experts have previously found Neanderthal artefacts there in the overlaying layers of the cave . Creative? The find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and Neanderthals (stock image) shared the capacity for abstract expression, according to a team of scientists who studied the site . The markings were already known to experts, but had been attributed to modern humans who arrived in Western Europe around 40,000 years ago. The pattern was overlaid by undisturbed rocks in which Neanderthal artefacts had been discovered before, indicating the ‘art’ is older. Archaeologists think the markings are 39,000 older than the other artefacts. Chemical analysis of the mineral coating on the engraved grooves also indicates the art was produced before deposition of the overlying sediment. The researchers shrunk photographs to microscopic scale to see the tool marks within the engraving and then compared them with experimental marks made with various tools. They decided the abstract cave engraving was likely created intentionally by repeatedly passing a robust cutting tip over the rock in the same direction - and not by incidental cutting associated with other activities. 'This discovery demonstrates the Neanderthals' capacity for abstract thought and expression.' Professor Paul Tacon, an expert in rock art at Australia's Griffith University who was not involved with the study, said: ‘It is the last nail in the coffin for the hypothesis that Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to modern humans. He believes that the marks were carved with great effort for ritual purposes and to communicate with others. ‘We will never know the meaning the design held for the maker or the Neanderthals who inhabited the cave, but the fact that they were marking their territory in this way before modern humans arrived in the region has huge implications for debates about what it is to be human and the origin of art,’ he added. But not everyone is convinced that our hairy ancestors were the ancient answer to Jackson Pollock. Another recently published study examining the dating of various archaeological sites across Europe raises the possibility that the markings may not have been made by Neanderthals but by modern humans. Neanderthals disappeared between 41,030 and 39,260 years ago, while modern humans arrived in Europe about 45,000 to 43,000 years ago, according to that study - leaving several thousand years of overlap. Dr Clive Gamble, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton, said: ‘Any discovery that helps improve the public image of Neanderthals is welcome.’ ‘We know they spoke, lived in large social groups, looked after the sick, buried their dead and were highly successful in the Ice Age environments of northern latitudes. As a result, rock engraving should be entirely within their grasp.’ ‘What is critical, however, is the dating. While I want Neanderthals to be painting, carving and engraving, I'm reserving judgment.’ Contentious: Not everyone is convinced that Neanderthals were the ancient answer to Jackson Pollock (art pictured). Another recently published study examining the dating of various archaeological sites across Europe raises the possibility that the markings may not have been made by Neanderthals but by modern humans. However, Professor Finlayson is certain that the artefacts, and therefore the engravings, were made by Neanderthals. ‘All European Neanderthal fossil sites from this period, including Devil's Tower Rock Shelter just one mile from Gorham's Cave, have this technology associated,’ he said. ‘In contrast no modern human site in Europe has this type of technology. So we are confident that the tools were made by Neanderthals.’ Previous research has suggested that Neanderthals could have survived in Gorham's Cave up to 24,000 years ago - making it one of the species' last refuge before modern humans completely took over. Recently uncovered archaeological evidence indicates Neanderthals were more civilised than they have been given credit for. It appears that inhabitants of the cave liked to dine on roast pigeon, while fireplaces and 'rooms' in caves have been found elsewhere, suggesting Neanderthals lived in organised homes. Toasted pigeon was a favourite dish of Neanderthals, who unlike their brutish reputation, had the brains and skill to catch the birds. The discovery, announced in August, was made after an excavation of Gorham's Cave where Neanderthals are thought to have lived for nearly 100,000 years ago. Archaeologists unearthed leftovers of Neanderthal feasts, which included pigeon bone, in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of Gibraltar. Researchers believe the Neanderthals hunted wild pigeons, possibly by climbing steep cliffs to reach raid their nests. So far, 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments. Many were of rock doves, the ancestors of modern feral pigeons. Twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks. Some also had signs of charring, which may have been created when the meat cooked on an open fire. 'They liked what we like and went for the breasts, the drumsticks and the wings,' study author Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, told journalists of the bone analysis. 'They had the knowledge and technology to do this.'","Cross-hatched engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art, archaeologists claim .

"Win, lose or draw true England fans will NEVER give up on their country, and I am one of those. You know the away fans’ views can always be trusted – these are the hardcore supporters. These guys take time off work and pay fortunes to follow England everywhere – with little reward on the pitch, and lately no reward off the pitch from the Football Association with it’s scandalous double points for Wembley loyalty scheme. The England fans in Basle on Monday made their feelings clear about that situation with some loud and lively songs directed towards the FA. The last thing Roy Hodgson and his players need is negativity from the fans, but their anger is fully justified after this diabolical decision penalizing loyalty. The FA should scrap it before the policy does some serious damage to the relationship between England and the loyal fans. Soaking up the atmosphere: Fans gather at the Hat-Trick bar in Basle before the game . Wurst and non-alcoholic beer were on the menu at the Hat-Trick Bar at the stadium before the game, Swiss fans decked in red were optimistic after what they considered to be a decent tournament in Brazil. England fans were calm, and most were hopeful of a draw at best. My pessimism evaporated on hearing the team news: Fabian Delph, Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling had more than a whiff of four-diamond-two about it and so it proved. It’s the system I’ve been desperate for England to play since Sterling burst onto the scene. We’ve got enough strikers now to play two up front so let’s stick with this system please Roy. England fans got in the ground early as always, and draped banners everywhere. The total myth that it is only lower division clubs’ fans who follow England was smashed to pieces as I saw flags from Manchester United, Sunderland and Newcastle hung up early on. Pride and passion: England fans show their support for Roy Hodgson's side during the win over Switzerland . Joe Hart received a rapturous welcome when he emerged for the warm up. And then the rest of the players came out to a great ovation. Standing in amongst those fans it was hard to believe England had gone out of the World Cup in record time. It was even harder to believe that there was any kind of anti-Hodgson feeling among these fans as they sang his name on more than one occasion during the match. From within that England section of the ground, doubts were raised about both full-backs, especially Leighton Baines. And one Yorkshireman behind me stunned me by saying Jordan Henderson had ‘done nothing.’ He and his mates celebrated England’s first goal by stripping to the waist. Classic Brits abroad! A semi-drunk bloke in front of me who ate three sausages during the game – believe me it was no fun sitting behind this guy – had his head in his hands as Danny Welbeck’s final ball in after a brilliant run came to nothing. Wrong move: Danny Welbeck misplaces his pass after a good move as England went on the attack . Head in hands moment: One England fan looks disappointed as Welbeck fails to find Sterling with his cross . Favourites among the England crowd at the game were Hart – ‘England’s number one’; Sterling, who is clearly the kind of player these fans have been waiting to see wear the Three Lions for a very long time; and Wayne Rooney. The England captain got the biggest cheer for the Norway game in midweek, and again when his name was read out in Basel, the fans saved their top volume for him. Some think Rooney is past his best. You won’t find many of those hardcore England fans in Switzerland agreeing with that. He may not have got on the scoresheet but he led by example, defending from the front, and playing a part in the goal to break the deadlock. And it might have been missed on TV but there were several moments in the game when the skipper offered encouragement to individuals. He’s a better captain than the sceptics realise. Backing: England fans sang Roy Hodgson's name during the game and were behind the manager . Some songs – particularly any referring to the IRA – didn’t belong at a football match. Others, especially the one strongly encouraging Scots to vote for independence, were hilarious. The national anthem got several airings as the evening went on. But the loudest singing was saved for Danny Welbeck. His second goal meant England fans could relax, sing loud and thoroughly enjoy their night. The trams outside the stadium were literally rocking as England fans celebrated. England's No 1: Joe Hart's name was sung by the England fans during the 2-0 win . Winning away is one of the best feelings whether it is your club or your country. The atmosphere was fantastic among the England fans – unthreatening and positive. Despite the massive disappointment of the summer, Hodgson received total support from the travelling England support in Basle. And his system, his gameplan, and his players won the game to reward those England fans. It’s just a qualifier, but it’s our toughest qualifier against a team that went further than we did at the World Cup, and who are above us in the rankings. I was at their World Cup tie in Sao Paolo when for 118 minutes the Swiss organised themselves superbly to keep Messi and co at bay. So to go there and win 2-0 is a huge result for Hodgson. Leader: Wayne Rooney took on the responsibility of being England captain very well . Job wel done: Welbeck celebrates infront of the England fans after the 2-0 win . It was great to see England play as a team, brilliant to see them win, and fantastic to see the players come over to us at the end of the game with smiles on their faces. Hart slapping his England badge was enough to show me that these players have got passion playing for their country. My advice to those whose tolerance has almost peaked with England is this: I understand the frustration. But never give up on your country. There are exciting and re-energised players in the England team. And when Roy gets it right as he did in Basle, it’s a brilliant feeling. They sent us home victorious. We were happy, it was glorious.","England fans in Basle showed their support for Roy Hodgson's side .

"Shocking twist of fate: George Mason III suffered a broken leg, neck and arm when--as he allegedly shot and killed his family members--he was accidentally hit by a car . A shooting rampage that left three people dead and one seriously hurt on Friday night in Florida would have claimed at least one more victim were it not for a passing driver who accidentally ran over the shooter, incapacitating him. George Mason III, 42, allegedly snapped before gunning down his 81-year-old grandmother, brother and the mother of his two children at their Brooksville home. A driver who didn't see Mason in the darkness smashed into the convicted felon, breaking his leg, arm and neck, before he could finish off his wounded half-brother Gabriel Taylor. Brooksville police Chief George Turner told the Tampa Bay Times that the driver inadvertently saved lives. 'He hit a murderer who was on a rampage,' Turner said. 'That truck driver, he was just a guy driving through the area, but he probably saved lives…He took out the shooter who was obviously hell bent on shooting people.' Unfortunately the car did not come soon enough to save Mason's grandmother Jannie V. Taylor, sibling Ralph Ray Peyton, 29, or the mother of his children Tarasha Townsend, 37. All three died at the scene. Gabriel Taylor found bleeding in a driveway and was rushed to a hospital. He's now undergone surgery for his injuries, which included a gunshot wound to the head. Mason is also recovering, but as of the weekend was heavily sedated and under guard. Police said the motive remained unknown. End to the carnage: Mason was hit near this intersection after allegedly shooting and killing his 81-year-old grandmother, brother and the mother of his children as well as wounding his half-brother on Friday night before a truck stopped the carnage . 'I don't know if we'll ever really know what happened. Only thing we can say for sure is all these folks knew each other,' Chief Turner told WTSP. Neighbors in the community, while unaccustomed to such shocking crimes, were less surprised about who among them allegedly ended up shattering the neighborhood's peace of mind. 'He was crazy as hell. He's been crazy all his life.' neighbor Charles Townsend told WFLA. 'There's more to that, but I'm not going to say. ' Mason has a lengthy arrest record and has been jailed previously on charges that include battery of a police officer as well as drug posession and trafficking. He's now charged with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.","Career criminal George Mason III was detained with a broken leg and a broken neck after allegedly shooting four people .

In the past six days alone, makeshift . weapons - containers packed with explosives, fuel and scrap metal - have . killed more than 250 people in Aleppo, including 73 children, according . to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. They include at least 11 who died Thursday - six of them from the same family - in the opposition-held neighborhood of Masaken Hanano. Videos uploaded by activists showed the aftermath, including men weeping amid ravaged buildings and corpses covered with blankets on the pavement. 'Be careful. There’s a corpse under your feet... It’s a child!' someone can be heard shouting. U.N.

"Citing a personal matter, Texas Rangers manager Ron Washington abruptly resigned from the team earlier today. His resignation took effect immediately, with bench coach Tim Bogar stepping up as interim manager for the remainder of the season . Washington, 62, had previously tested positive for cocaine during the 2009 season, and been subjected to random drug testing ever since, with then-team president Nolan Ryan deciding to keep him on as manager, even as he offered to leave the team. Resigned: Ron Washington released a statement today announcing he would be stepping down as manager of the Texas Rangers, citing a 'personal matter' General manager Jon Daniels told ESPN that Washington's resignation is 'not drug-related.' 'I have submitted my resignation from the job I love - managing the Rangers - in order to devote my full attention to addressing an off-the-field personal matter,' Washington said in a statement. 'As painful as it is, stepping away from the game is what's best for me and my family.' He then added, 'This is in no way related to the disappointing performance of the team this season.' Last place: The Rangers have a record of 53-87 this season, and were the first MLB team officially eliminated from making the playoffs . The Rangers, in the midst of a six-game losing streak, are the first major league team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention this year, and have a record of 53-87 with 22 games left to play in the season. Washington had been the Rangers manager since the start of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, and led the team to World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011. Prior to joining the Rangers, Washington spent 11 seasons as an assistant coach with the Oakland Athletics. He went 664-611 with the Rangers, earning more wins than any manager in club history. He also enjoyed four consecutive 90-win seasons, three playoff appearances, and back-to-back American League championships. The Rangers were 18-16 in Washington's three postseason appearances. Success: Washington coached the Rangers to appearances in two World Series, in 2010 and 2011 . 'He has left his mark as a teacher, motivator, and leader on this organization,' said Daniels.

"Roy Hodgson claimed his young England team came of age after Danny Welbeck’s stunning double against Switzerland took the pressure off the head coach. England opened their Euro 2016 qualification campaign with a 2-0 victory in Basle to give Hodgson a major lift after last summer’s disastrous World Cup. He said: ‘We had an unfortunate time in Brazil which was a kick in the teeth. Now we can pick up our teeth, put them in and we go again. VIDEO Scroll down for Danny Welbeck: Our players and their speed works with the diamond . Job done: England boss Roy Hodgson celebrates during his side's 2-0 win in Switzerland . At the double: Danny Welbeck wraps up victory for England . ‘The players took enormous responsibility. We’ve been pushing that for a while now, about ownership and them making certain it’s not just listening and following instructions, but understanding them and believing and knowing they can do it. ‘We did that from the first minute. This was always going to be a difficult game because Switzerland don’t lose at home. The last time was when England beat them. 'We missed some chances early on but, when Dany eventually scored, it was going to open up on the counter-attack. We can do that with the youth and energy of the team, and that showed to good effect. ‘These are our talented players. This is the way forward. We’ve got to back them. ‘I’m pleased we adopted a bold approach, asked a lot of these players, but only because if it’s going to work in the future, if this group of players is to become any good, we’ve got to do it from the start. Three-sy does it: England's forwards combined for Welbeck's opener . Hotshot: Welbeck scored twice for the Three Lions in the Euro 2016 qualifier . ‘We had to go from the start as we mean to continue, and luckily we got the start which will help us.’ Welbeck scored opened the scoring after 58 minutes with a well-taken finished and close the game out with a second in injury time at St Jakob-Park. Hodgson added: ‘I speak to him often and often I’ve heard him say – I’ve asked him what his best position is – centre-forward, but he understands fully that position wasn’t available to him in the past in an England shirt. ‘Others have got in the team before him. He’s understood the need to do the job elsewhere. We changed the formation towards the end of the game and he was pushed wide and Raheem on the other side. Big threat: Raheem Sterling ran the Swiss defence ragged . Talking point: Former England boss Glenn Hoddle (right) was an ITV pundit for the game in Basle alongside former England internationals Lee Dixon (left) and Ian Wright . 'He’s never complained. He’s always said he’d play where I wanted him to play, but I’ve never been left in doubt that he wanted to play centrally.’ Hodgson changed his formation following the poor performance at Wembley against Norway at last Wednesday. Raheem Sterling was outstanding playing just off England’s two main strikers. Joe Hart was also exceptional in goal. Hodgson added: ‘We thought about the formation at the start of the week but decided against Norway to start in another way. ‘The performance against Norway, especially the latter part – we had a period of flux where we didn’t play too well for 15-20 minutes – and we were pleased when Raheem moved into the middle and Danny went up front.’ Tussle: Welbeck battles for possession with Ricardo Rodriguez .

"She was last week dubbed ‘Two Kitchens Kate’ after installing a second kitchen at her Kensington Palace apartment, but The Mail on Sunday can reveal the Duchess of Cambridge has gone one better. Kate is now installing a third new kitchen – this time at her and William’s country mansion in Norfolk –after replacing a lovingly-crafted £38,000 kitchen most young couples could only dream of. Pictures of the out-of-favour kitchen at Anmer Hall, the ten-bedroom country bolthole William and Kate are renovating in North Norfolk, were proudly posted online by the designer couple who installed it about six years ago. Scroll down for videos . Polished off: The Everetts' luxurious hand-crafted kitchen at Anmer Hall, the new Norfolk home of William and Kate. It featured £17,000 worth of beautiful hardwood worktops and an £8,630 fridge . Gleaming: The lavish kitchen also boasted a white artisan espresso maker worth £630, and a £195 end-grain chopping block.  Even the drainage board represented the height of luxury, costing £275 . Jamie and Jayne Everett, who run a bespoke kitchen design firm, installed the lavish kitchen – with gleaming surfaces and state-of-the-art appliances – when they lived at the Georgian mansion, which is  in the grounds of The Queen’s Sandringham Estate. It featured £17,000 worth of beautifully hand-crafted hardwood worktops with inset double Belfast sink and elegant mixer taps, a large Aga costing £11,495 and an £8,630 fridge. It also boasted a white artisan espresso maker worth £630, and a £195 end-grain chopping block.  Even the drainage board represented the height of luxury, costing £275. But a Royal source, who asked not to be named, said the kitchen would probably be unrecognisable once Kate and William had turned it to their own taste, saying: ‘The couple have decided to make changes to the kitchen at Anmer Hall and a lot of what was there is not there any more.’ News of the redesign will be a blow to the Everetts, whose current website wishes the Duke and Duchess well in their new kitchen. The couple posted a message alongside the photographs which reads: ‘We left behind one of the most gratifying kitchens we made, the Anmer Hall kitchen. Two Kitchens Kate: The Duchess installed a second, private family kitchen at her four-storey Kensington Palace apartment. She will now put a new one in the ten-bedroom bolthole her and William are renovating . 'The silver lining to this is that I am certain that the new occupants, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, are enjoying it as much as we did!’ The Duchess was dubbed Two Kitchens Kate after it emerged she and her husband had installed a second kitchen in their new Kensington Palace apartment. Having already replaced the existing 350 sq ft kitchen designed by Princess Margaret’s husband Lord Snowdon, at  a reported cost to taxpayers of £170,000, William and Kate then wanted a second, private family kitchen in their four-storey home. Royal officials have been keen to stress that the couple paid for this one themselves. Anmer Hall: Kate and William's Norfolk home in the grounds of the Queen's Sandringham Estate. Jamie and Jayne Everett installed the £38,000 kitchen when they lived at the Georgian mansion before the royal couple . The cost of renovating Apartment 1A, which takes up more than half  of one of the wings at Kensington Palace, has now spiralled to more than £4 million. Meanwhile, the refurbishments at Grade II-listed Anmer Hall are costing £1.5 million, which will be paid mostly by the Royal Family from private funds. The figure includes £500,000 to replace roof tiles and a further half a million to landscape the front lawn. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman last night declined to comment on what she insisted was a  private matter.

"So, it transpires, it is going to take more than the zap of a turbo smile from a £60million footballer to lighten the mood at Old Trafford. It will take more than the dazzle of his diamonds and the glisten of gel in his hair. It has been a gloomy few days of introspection since the mauling in Milton Keynes and Manchester United’s unveiling of Angel di Maria, the most expensive player ever signed by a British club, was not enough to unfurrow Louis van Gaal’s brow. There would be no quick fix, no miracles and no magic, warned Van Gaal, stern beside Di Maria. The mood was enhanced by the choice of Going Down by the Stone Roses as the soundtrack to the event. Unveiling: Angel di Maria (left) poses with his number 7 shirt alongside new manager Louis van Gaal . Welcome: Van Gaal (left) walks along the pitch at Old Trafford with new signing Di Maria on Thursday . Theatre of Dreams: Di Maria poses with his new shirt after signing for United for a record fee of £60m . The arrival of Di Maria means United now have the most expensive squad in the league . Manchester United £401.2m . Manchester City £344.15m . Chelsea £341.8m . Liverpool £245.8m . Arsenal £209.5m . Di Maria must have wondered why no-one had warned him. Still, the 26-year-old Argentine seemed happy enough to be there, nodding and explaining through an interpreter how he was here to win trophies and help United back to the top. He would, he stressed, be happy to play in any position, and was not concerned by his price tag. His unburdened delight began to ebb away, however, when Van Gaal intervened and suggested his own words ought to be translated for the benefit of Di Maria, in effect providing the new arrival with a handy summary of a dismal start to the season. It certainly isn’t like this at the Bernabeu. When Real broke records to sign Gareth Bale they packed the stadium and put their new Galactico on a podium to juggle the ball while fireworks were shot into the sky. Di Maria was shoved before the in-house television station for a quick interview, snapped holding his new shirt and sat before a brisk press conference, held without irony in the Europa Suite on a day when the Champions League draw was going on without United for the first time in nearly 20 years. Di Maria will wear No 7, an iconic shirt at Old Trafford. Facing the media: Val Gaal (left) speaks during a press conference at Old Trafford as Di Maria looks on . In charge: Van Gaal listens to a journalist's question as the gathering takes place in the Europa Suite . ‘I was aware of the importance of the No 7 shirt,’ said Di Maria. ‘Cristiano Ronaldo had spoken to me at Real Madrid and told me how important it was. The club also wanted me to wear it so I want to live up to it.’ Ronaldo said on Thursday night: ‘I wish the best to him, he’s a fantastic player, he’s going to do well at United. I said to him “No 7 is a big responsibility” but he will be able to take that shirt because he’s a fantastic player. Personally, it’s a shame for me because I liked Di Maria.’ Manchester United, of course, have no pretension to mimic Real’s obsession with glitz and glamour. For all their global reach and commercial power, they have always been a club where substance matters more than style. And perhaps here is where Di Maria fits in, with his reputation for humility and hard work, which he combines on the pitch with his pace and superhuman stamina to great effect. ‘He is a very modest guy,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He wants to work. He showed that last year. He played 52 matches and gave 22 assists. How many players can say that? It means you are a social human being and in the football world that is not always the case. Taunt: MK Dons’ kit sponsor Sondico parked this cheeky van outside Old Trafford . ‘He will be a player who can enjoy defence. It is important that he is a team player. He can accelerate our play but also plays in interests of the team. He fits our philosophy. What’s more, he means I can change the system. ‘He played at Real Madrid not only on the right wing but also in midfield. That’s also a reason we are convinced he will succeed. But he has been with us for two days. He has to adapt to the team and the team to him. We cannot expect that he is a miracle after two days. No, you have to work for the miracle and he knows that.’ Patience and time was central to the message, as well it might be. David Moyes was granted only one summer transfer window after replacing Sir Alex Ferguson and Van Gaal is three days from the end of his first. Asked if he was surprised at the scale of the work required, only 15 months after United’s last title, the Dutchman said: ‘Yes, but that is looking at the past. That’s a question I don’t want to answer because I want to show my respect to David Moyes and Mr Ferguson. Nice to see you: New signing Di Maria smiles for the cameras at his Old Trafford unveiling . ‘We have to look at the future and we are doing that by restoring and rebuilding a new team. That costs time — I’m sorry to say that, sorry for the fans because the fans are amazing. We lost 4-0 in MK Dons and they were singing and supporting the players. I hope we will fulfil their expectations, but it is not done in one month.’ United will attempt to follow the signing of Di Maria with more, with sights set on William Carvalho, Arturo Vidal and Daley Blind. They will also hope to soon have Marcos Rojo available. He was in Madrid on Thursday awaiting a work permit. ‘Also, players shall go,’ said Van Gaal. Aston Villa last night had an £8m bid for Tom Cleverley accepted, with Hull and Everton also keen. Javier Hernandez is in talks with Juventus and Valencia and Wilfried Zaha has returned to Crystal Palace on loan. Di Maria can be forgiven if his head was in a spin. He must have wondered what was changing in the background as he smiled for the cameras in the crash of the flashbulbs.

"Ally McCoist paid tribute to his players for ignoring the off-field dramas and fan protests that continue to engulf the Ibrox club to secure a much-needed win. Rangers had to come from behind twice to see off the challenge of an impressive Queen of the South side and keep up with Championship leaders Hearts. Once again, events away from the pitch this week grabbed the headlines, with the board launching a new shares issue in a desperate bid to raise funds. And there was a mild fans’ protest too when a section of the Broomloan Road Stand held up red cards and chanted: ‘Sack the board’. Opener: Marius Zaliukas celebrates Rangers' first goal with Kris Boyd during their 4-2 win at Ibrox . Rangers: Simonsen, Zaliukas (Templeton 45 (Miller 85)), Mohsni, McGregor, Wallace, Law, McCulloch, MacLeod, Peralta (Black 45), Boyd, Clark. Subs Not Used: Smith, Faure, Shiels, Robinson. Goals: Zaliukas 27, Templeton 46, Mohsni 64, Miller 86. Queen of the South: Clark, Holt, Dowie, Higgins, Durnan, Russell, Dzierzawski, Kidd, Carmichael, Reilly (Baird 66), Lyle (Smith 71). Subs Not Used: Atkinson, Slattery, Hooper, Smith. Booked: Holt . Goals: Reilly 22, Russel 36. Att: 31,851 . Amid this sideshow, goals from Marius Zaliukas, David Templeton, Bilel Mohsni and Kenny Miller won the match for McCoist’s men. ‘I have to say I congratulate my players for the last two or three years,’ said the Ibrox boss. ‘If they have wanted an excuse or to look over their shoulders for an issue or two that’s been happening around the club or involving the club, there’s been massive opportunity for them to do that. They haven’t done it. ‘You have just got to blank (fans’ protests) it out. It can’t become an issue because if we lose track or focus on the job we have to do, then the game’s a bogey. ‘We can’t allow it to affect us. It’s easy to say that, but doing it is a different thing and up until now, our lads deserve a lot of credit in their focus on getting results for this football club.’ The latest dire predictions of financial doom were indeed placed to one side in an entertaining encounter. Lead: Gavin Reilly slotted the Queen of the South ahead after 22 minutes as Rangers struggled to get going . While the latest share issue and the implications it could have were it to be under-subscribed stole the headlines in the build-up to this encounter, McCoist wouldn’t have needed to be told of the seriousness of the situation on the park had Queens held on to their advantage and Rangers had fallen six points behind leaders Hearts already. After Zaliukas had netted in between goals from Queen of the South’s Gavin Reilly and Iain Russell, which handed the visitors a deserved first-half lead, the home side stepped up their efforts after the break when McCoist made two significant changes. He was rewarded when one of those replacements — Templeton — immediately equalised, before Mohsni headed them in front and fellow sub Miller made sure of the points with a late strike. Early on, Queens looked the more dangerous team and Jim McIntryre’s bold policy of playing three up front caused problems. It was no great surprise when the visitors took the lead midway through the first half. Chris Higgins played a superb pass that cut open the Rangers defence to release Danny Carmichael on the right. He squared the ball for Reilly, who slotted past the exposed Steve Simonsen. Ahead again: Iain Russell fired Queen of the South ahead to lead 2-1 at the break at Ibrox . Equaliser: Rangers' David Templeton celebrates his equalising goal with team mate Darren McGregor for 2-2 . Comeback: Bilel Mohsni's header gave Rangers the lead for the first time as Rangers came from behind to win . Nicky Clark and Kris Boyd both then came close with long-range shots and Rangers quickly equalised in the 27th minute after a corner. Darren McGregor’s volley was initially blocked by keeper Zander Clark, but the ball rebounded out to Zaliukas. The former Hearts defender sent a looping header back in which ended up in the back of the net when Clark flapped at it under pressure from Mohsni. Zaliukas then turned villain when his error allowed Queens to regain the lead. He completely misjudged a high ball, allowing Reilly to gallop clear. He unselfishly teed up Russell, who easily scored, with Simonsen again given no chance. McCoist sent on Templeton and Ian Black at half-time in place of Zaliukas and Arnold Peralta and the substitutions paid dividends just 57 seconds into the second period when Templeton curled a superb left-foot shot into the corner of the net. Rangers finally took the lead in the 64th minute when Moshni stooped very low indeed to direct Lewis Macleod’s corner at goal and it trickled into the net. Templeton limped off and his replacement Miller replicated his feat of scoring almost immediately after he came on with a composed finish to net his first goal in his third spell with Rangers .

"The E! Entertainment network has apologized to Michael J. Fox after viewers witnessed a grossly insensitive screen graphic which referred to his diagnosis with Parkinsons Disease as a 'fun fact'. Twitter exploded with rage at the network for its message which declared that the popular 52-year-old Back to the Future and Spin City actor has been suffering the degenerative condition for 22-years. Responding to the widely condemned screen graphic, E! issued a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, saying, 'We regret the insensitive classification of Michael J. Fox's Parkinson's diagnosis during our Eonline live stream. We understand the serious nature of the disease and sincerely apologize.' The graphic was shown during E!'s live stream of red carpet coverage Sunday, although not on TV. As the actor was entering the Beverly Hills Hilton, the 'fun fact' graphic noted Fox's diagnosis in 1991. Fox was nominated for best actor in a comedy for his new NBC show. Insensitive: Golden Globe viewers were horrified when E!'s idea of some light hearted information about Michael J. Fox [pictured with wife Tracy Pollen] included details on his illness Parkinson's . Horrified: The Twittersphere erupted in outrage after E! shared this 'fun fact' during the Golden Globes . Outrage: This Twitter user clearly expressed their thoughts on the decision to label Michael J. Fox's diagnosis with Parkinson's Disease a fun fact . Anger: The popular actor has bravely continued to work despite his diagnosis with the degenerative condition and Twitter was extremely critical of E! A barrage of tweets blasted the message with user Adam Milligan writing: 'in what world is this considered to be a ""fun"" fact (sic),' Aisling Keehan wrote 'NOT A FUN FACT AT ALL (sic),' and Paige F. MacGregor fumed 'Somewhere, a graphics person should be fired.' The gaffe led to a series of memes on Twitter with users inserting their own insensitive messages into the fact box. These included '37 cats died during the making of Inside Llewyn Davis' and 'there is no afterlife, just eternal nothingness' Michael, who rose to fame on Family Ties and went on the star in the Back to the Future movies, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991. Another fun fact: Mocking E! and their Michael J. Fox graphic - Twitter and the Internet set to work to make fun of their serious error . Is this fun? This fact seems to take the mocking of E! slightly further in reference to the Coen brothers new movie . He attended the awards looking dapper in a black suit with his wife Tracy Pollan, who looked beautiful in a full length blue dress with a gold clutch. While Fox has struggled with his fate over the years he previously said he wouldn't change his diagnosis even if he could. 'If I walked into a room with God or Buddha or Bill Gates or Sergey Brin or whoever could figure out a way to fix it for me, I don't think I'd do it,' he told Rolling Stone. ‘Because I wouldn't have gone through . what I've gone through and I wouldn't have had the experience I've had, . and I can still do my s**t. At the end of the day I can still do a . show. So what have I lost?' 'The . point is, we all have our bag of hammers. We all have our own s**t. It's like the parable about this circle of people and everyone takes . their worst problem and puts it in the middle and they all get to choose . one to take back – and they all end up choosing their own. And that's . kind of it. You'd always take your own problems back over someone . else's.' After a multiple . year absence from a full time sitcom, the Family Ties star made his . return to television with NBC's The Michael J. Fox Show last year. Diagnosis: Michael, who rose to fame on Family Ties and went on the star in the Back to the Future movies, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991 . 'I like the idea of having started playing the son on a family show,' he said. 'Then an adult in a workplace, and now playing a middle-aged father at home. It's nice – it's a good arc.' The actor is somewhat of a medical anomaly. He was told that he would have to step away from the big and small screen within 10 years of his original diagnosis. 'I just don't tell myself that I can't do it,' he explained. 'Then I just do it. A show is easier to regulate than life. There's no surprises, really. You know what you have to do in a given day, and you rest and medicate accordingly. I'm shocked at how much easier this is than I thought it would be.' The Spin City star hasn't always had it so easy, though. Not too long after he was first diagnosed, he slipped into alcoholism, using the haze of booze to numb the pain. Michael had been married to Family Ties co-star Tracy for only three years and the couple had a son - Sam -  when he got the news. 'I was at a loss as to how to deal with it,' he says. 'The idea of, ""Did I suck this woman into a bum deal and have a kid right away and then fall into this situation?"" It was much easier to have a buzz going and not deal with the reality of it.' The actor subsequently entered treatment and now has four children with Tracy.

"Divorcing parents who try to maintain an amicable relationship for the sake of their children are doing nothing to help them, a major study suggests. The impact of the split on youngsters is the same whether or not the mother and father keep cordial links, it found. The findings undermine a Government-backed consensus that the harm caused to children by separating parents can be limited if the couple remain friends. Scroll down for video . Trauma: Children of separated parents are more likely to suffer behavioural problems later in life whether or not their parents are on good terms, according to a study by U.S. researchers (picture posed by model) Three Whitehall ministries are currently ploughing money into supporting a policy on divorce and family break-up which says that it is conflict between the parents and not their separation itself that harms children. The new study, the first in 20 years to examine how the behaviour of separated parents affects their children, was carried out by US academics. It covered 270 parents who were divorced or separated between 1998 and 2004 in an unnamed US state that compels divorcees to take part in an education programme on ‘co-operative co-parenting’. Of these, 31 per cent considered their relationship with their ex-spouse as ‘co-operative and involved’; 45 per cent were ‘moderately engaged’ with their divorced partner, with some conflict between them; and 24 per cent said their co-operation was ‘infrequent but conflictual’. They were asked to say how their break-up had affected the youngest child in their family. The average age of children involved was eight years. The study, published in the academic journal Family Relations, said that children of divorced parents are more likely than others to suffer ‘external’ symptoms such as behaviour problems or drug abuse, more likely to have ‘internal’ difficulties like anxiety or depression, and more likely to do badly at school. But the researchers, headed by Dr Jonathon Beckmeyer of Indiana University, found that these children’s problems were no worse if their parents continued to row and bicker with each other after the divorce . Cut off: The study undermines a government consensus about divorce which says conflict is the problem . The study said ‘despite the expectation that children fare better’ if their divorced parents develop a co-operative relationship, the behaviour of children as assessed by their parents ‘did not significantly differ’ between the friendly and the fighting groups of divorcees. Divorced parents should be reassured that their children will not be more seriously harmed if they fail to establish a cordial and co-operative relationship with their former husband or wife, it added. The most recent authoritative British investigation into whether conflict or divorce is worse for children was published in 1994. David Cameron’s Coalition has produced a guide for divorcing parents called Sorting Out Separation which tells them: ‘It’s not the separation itself that can cause harm to your children, it’s the level of conflict that they see or hear between parents. This is universally recognised as being very harmful.’ The programme was launched in 2012 by Lib Dem Pensions Minister Steve Webb, who said: ‘Parents working together is in the best interests of the children, and more collaboration helps minimise the impact of separation on them.’ But Harry Benson, of the Marriage Foundation pressure group, said: ‘This study fully exposes the mismatch between parents’ and children’s perceptions. ‘Getting on well might make the parents feel better about their split. But it does little for the children. To them it makes no sense if the parents get on well yet won’t live together. The “good divorce” is a myth.’","U.S. study examined 270 parents who split between 1998 and 2004 .

"Two years ago, after Roberto Mancini delivered Manchester City’s first league title since 1968, this lot took their foot of the gas. They coasted through the season, finishing 11 points behind Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League. Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax finished them off in group stages of the Champions League. Those in power at City vowed that it would never be allowed to happen again. VIDEO Scroll down for Manuel Pellegrini: Never any doubts about Stevan Jovetic quality . All smiles: Manchester City celebrate Sergio Aguero's strike during the 3-1 win over Liverpool at The Etihad . This team, who saw off the threat of Liverpool last season, have been reconstructed under Manuel Pellegrini. They have the mentality of champions. Just look at the substitutes bench, where Bacary Sagna, Aleksandar Kolarov, James Milner, Fernandinho, Jesus Navas and Sergio Aguero keep each other company. ‘I came here because they are the best team in the country,’ claimed Sagna in his first interview with the club’s matchday programme. It is hard to disagree. This team look like they mean business, which is just the way we want it after Chelsea opened the season with two victories. In the hotseat: Manuel Pellegrini has put together a Manchester City team who have the mentality of champions . It is too early in the season for anyone to start pulling away in the Premier League. The hunger is there, underpinned by the brisk and purposeful passing of Yaya Toure at the heart of City’s midfield last night. Liverpool midfielders Philippe Coutinho and Joe Allen, in for Lucas Leiva, never got near him. When City score, as they did 102 times in the Premier League last season, no-one in the crowd looks at each other agog any more. Yes, it really is happening. When Stevan Jovetic follows his opener with goal made from the sweetest of moves, it is normal service. Last night, at the Etihad, it was resumed. Jovetic was exceptional, providing the classiest moment of the match when his backheeled flick to Nasri left Liverpool’s defence flat-footed. He scored and City, who made 19 passes together in the move, felt unstoppable. There will be times when it feels routine, particularly for those who criss-cross the country to watch the champions on their travels. At St James’ Park, on the opening weekend, it felt and looked like they were always in control. Perhaps they are saving themselves, sparing their legs as they prepare for the 38 game assault on the Premier League and the travelling that will come with their Champions League dream. Pass master: Yaya Toure, pictured taking on Liverpool's Joe Allen, won the midfield battle against the Reds . Exceptional: Stevan Jovetic found the back of the net twice in the win over last season's runners-up Liverpool . They have yet to make an impression on the competition, but the draw for the six group games, all played before Christmas, is on Thursday. It is time for City to go deep into the competition after assembling one of the strongest squads in Europe. Irrespective of their inexperience at this level, they have to do better. City’s fans, all 40,000-plus inside this stadium, operate in real-time these days. This team can live with the best now, they proved that with this determined performance against Liverpool. The Community Shield, the half-baked effort at Wembley earlier this month where they lost 3-0 to Arsenal, has already been forgotten. City are only going to get bigger now that they are sitting on two Premier League titles. At the top of the South Stand, the scaffolding is in place as the club get to work on adding another 6,000 seats to the stadium. Next summer it will be the turn of the North Stand for some cosmetic surgery, given a facelift as they plan for the future. In the boardroom suite, where the great and good can mingle with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak or club ambassador Mike Summerbee on matchday, they have relaxed the rules. Suit and tie is out this season, with jeans and smart trainers allowed, even in the posh part. On the pitch, they look like the sharpest team in town.","Stevan Jovetic scored two as Manchester City beat Liverpool 3-1 at the Etihad .

"Childhood pictures of a private schoolgirl who fled to Syria to fight for the Islamic State have been released by her heartbroken parents as part of a renewed bid to bring her home. The pictures of Aqsa Mahmood show her as a baby, being cradled by her loving father Muzzaffar, and capture her smiling while posing next to her brothers and sisters. Aqsa, now 20, left her Glasgow home in November after becoming radicalised by 'online material' and fled to Syria where she married an ISIS fighter. One of the images, part of the Mahmood's family collection, shows the youngster sitting next to a bottle of her beloved Irn Bru, a drink she said she 'longed for' on a Twitter post recently uploaded from the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Aqsa Mahmood's father Muzaffar holds the private schoolgirl as a baby. The last time she spoke to her parents was in Ferbuary, when she informed them she was marrying an ISIS fighter . Muzzaffar said he did not know what happened to 'the best daughter we could have'. He said she 'loved school' and was 'very friendly' The 20-year-old left her Glasgow home in November after becoming radicalised by 'online material' and fled to Syria where she married an ISIS fighter . Her parents have described how their daughter, who grew up listening to Coldplay and reading Harry Potter books, phoned them on the Turkish border with Syria to tell them she would next see them on 'judgement day' and would 'hold their hands' as she led them to heaven. In a heartbreaking interview, her father told CNN: 'She was the best daughter we could have, we don't know what happened to her. 'We are a moderate Muslim family, and it was a big shock for us.' The interviewer then asked what Aqsa said during the final phone call, before she made the crossing towards Aleppo to join the fighting. 'One message was that I will see you on the day of judgement day.I will take you to heaven, I will hold your hand. That's what she said.' The devastated pair hoped their daughter who 'loved school' would one day become a doctor, but when the violence in Syria started to worsen, she became more religious and began to pray more often. When her parents discovered that she was heading for Aleppo, they were shocked because she was 'afraid of the dark' and didn't even know which bus to take into Glasgow city centre. Family lawyer Aamer Anwar said he believes that she was radicalised by extremist material online that is making young women like Aqsa vulnerable. He said: 'If this could happen to someone like her, someone so intelligent, then it could happen to anybody.' Her mother then issued a final plea for their daughter to return home. She said: 'My dear daughter please come back. I am missing you so much. Your brothers and sisters miss you a lot. My dearest daughter, in the name of Allah, please come home. I love you.' Aqsa, pictured as a youngster, recently Tweeted how she longed for and missed drinking Irn-Bru . Aqsa's mother Khaleda said hsiblings 'missed her a lot' and her departure had torn their family apart . Earlier this week they told the media they were horrified that their 'sweet, peaceful, intelligent' child had joined jihadists in Syria and had hoped she would become a doctor in Britain. Even though they had branded her a 'bedroom radical', they promised that 'she is safe to return home and her family will open their door to her and take her back'. They said: 'We still love you, Aqsa, but we now have to put your family, your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step. 'You have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever. Please come home.' The couple also confirmed that their daughter had been keeping in touch with them through social media since fleeing Britain, but said they had not heard from her since her involvement with ISIS was revealed earlier this week.","Muzaffar and Khalida Mahmood said Aqsa 'loved school' and was 'friendly'

"Sepp Blatter wants to give managers the ability to challenge referee’s calls during stops in play. Speaking for the Soccerex event in Manchester, the FIFA president – who confirmed he will once again stand for re-election – says managers could, once or twice a half, question the referee’s decision. When a decision is challenged the manager and referee will watch the decision on an off-pitch monitor and the referee can choose whether to overturn his decision. VIDEO Sepp Blatter discussing Qatar and Russia with Jeff Powell ahead of Soccerex . New ideas: Sepp Blatter hopes to trial the new system at the U20 tournament in New Zealand next year . Blatter also insisted that the 'call system' would not work like the third-umpire in cricket, as the power to overturn would remain with the referee. The 78-year-old also suggested he would like to trial the new system - which, he says, could only be used in games where television companies are present - in the U20 World Cup in New Zealand. In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail, he said: ‘The next step I will propose to the international board to try and bring this so-called ‘call’ that the coaches or team managers have the right in the half, twice or once to have a call to challenge a refereeing decision but only when the game has stopped. ‘Then there must be a monitor by the television company, then the referee and coach look at it and the referee may then change his mind as is the case in tennis for instance. Continuity: Blatter announced he is to continue as FIFA president for the fifth term running . ‘In American football, the chief referee figure does not look at the evidence. That is done by someone off the pitch as it is done in cricket. It is referred to another referee or umpire, but you are going to engage the referee. ‘He can look at it, but he made the decision that was wrong so he has to change it. ‘I hope to bring it to the attention and hopefully we can find a league, semi-professional or professional that will try to do it. 'It can only be done where there is television coverage of all the matches, or in one of FIFA’s competitions, a youth competition in FIFA to do so, an Under 20 like next year we are in New Zealand so we could test such a ‘challenge calls’.’","The FIFA president wants a new system in place in football for managers to challenge referee's calls .

"File the following under the category of you simply would not have believed it possible if you had not witnessed it with your own eyes. At the BMW Championship in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, Rory McIlroy followed up four putting from four feet at the 12th on Saturday with another four putt from inside 20 feet on the same hole on Sunday. ‘I actually holed a decent length putt as well to avoid the second five putt of my life,’ said McIlroy afterwards. How on earth does this happen two days in a row, to the world No 1 of all people? Was the green perched on the side of a rocky mountain? Mood: Rory McIlroy's putting was not up to scratch for the second day in a row, leaving him in a foul mood . In fact, it was just more evidence that no sport likes embarrassing its star performers quite like this one. As the Northern Irishman put it, succinctly: ‘It goes to show we are capable of doing the same things club golfers do every weekend.’ McIlroy had been playing beautifully as well. He was living up to the promise of a tweet he had dispatched earlier to seize the day and he certainly did that during a wonderfully played front nine of 30 strokes. All the momentum was with him, as he holed a 60 yard approach at the par four 7th for an eagle two. Then came the fateful 12th. After a good tee shot to 19 feet, his first putt drifted five feet past the hole, and he pulled that one to leave himself a slippery three footer. When that one missed he leaned against his putter for the longest time. BMW: McIlroy and plenty of others were jockeying for position for the finale to the FedEx Cup play-offs . Like the rest of us, he clearly couldn’t believe it was happening again. When he finally looked in the direction of his ball, he must have been horrified to see if further away from the hole than his previous two putts. Thankfully he knocked in the six footer, or he might still be there now. Two pars on that hole instead of a six and a five would have left McIlroy one shot off the lead, rather than playing out the last few holes for pride. He did that well enough, birdieing the 16th and 17th for a 66. ’There was no point dwelling on it,’ he said. ‘You can’t beat yourself up. We all know these things happen occasionally.’ The good news was that in the context of his season what happened at the 12th is meaningless, and it’s that way too concerning the FedEx Cup finale which begins in Atlanta on Thursday. Put: McIlroy followed up four putting  at the 12th on Saturday with another four putt on the same hole . Attitude: McIlroy was philosophical when talking about his putting form on social media . Of the 30 competitors, he will start in third place and in control of his own destiny in the race for the $10million bonus. As for the BMW, American Billy Horschel held off a spirited challenge from Masters champion Bubba Watson and Sergio Garcia, who came to grief with a calamitous triple bogey eight at the 17th. There was also plenty of high drama in the Swiss Alps, where little-known American David Lipsky prevailed at the first hole of a play-off against Englishman Graeme Storm in the Omega European Masters. European Masters: Graeme Storm enjoyed his best day since 2007 at European Masters, coming second . What a week this was for 36-year-old Storm. He went to Crans-sur-Sierre following a wretched season without a single redeeming top 20 finish, and in grave danger of losing his tour card. On Saturday he won a £100,000 car for a hole-in-one that was more than he had earned all year. Then on Sunday he showed considerable composure to hole a stomach-churning six footer to make the play-off. A poor drive cost him, alas, but the runner’s up prize of £178,480 still completed his best week since winning the 2007 French Open.","Rory McIlroy's putting woe continued at BMW Championship .

"Pictured: Sixteen-year-old Christina Edkins was stabbed to death as she travelled to school on a busy bus in Birmingham city centre this morning . A teenage girl was stabbed to death in front of terrified commuters yesterday on a bus taking her to school. Christina Edkins, 16, who had tweeted of fears about men following her on public transport, was in her uniform on the top deck of the bus in Birmingham city centre when she was stabbed in the neck by a man, witnesses said. The rush-hour attack took place in front of horrified passengers, who are thought to have included other schoolchildren. Some fought to save her life but Christina, who was travelling alone, was pronounced dead at the scene shortly afterwards. A 22-year-old man was arrested 100 yards from where the attack took place. Last night, friends and family paid tribute to the victim, describing her as a ‘bright and popular’ young girl. Her parents Jason, 42, and Kathleen, 47, and siblings Joanne, 24, and Ryan, 18, were said to be ‘deeply distressed’. Police said they were treating the murder as a ‘random attack’ and do not believe Christina knew her killer. Only weeks ago, however, she had told friends about a strange man lurking near her on the bus. ‘This man is worrying me on the bus, keeps getting up and walking up and down stairs and sitting in different places,’ she wrote on Twitter. Christina, who recently turned 16, had also told friends she hated travelling on public transport, saying she could not wait for her next birthday when she could start to drive. In other messages on Twitter, she wrote of feeling unable to trust more than a few people in her life and just the day before she was killed she asked her followers: ‘Why can’t something go right for once?’ The teenager, who wanted to become a nurse, was killed as she travelled to school to sit a mock GCSE exam, friends said.

"Families are spending too much time using technology and not enough talking round the dinner table, a Government adviser has warned. Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, said parents are letting ‘screens take over’ from family time, blaming the rising popularity of smartphones and tablets, such as iPads. Mr Bailey, who carried out a review into the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood for David Cameron three years ago, said British parents are among those in Europe most likely to neglect their children. Reg Bailey, chief executive at the Mother's Union, said not enough British families sit around the table for a family meal and tend to sit in front of the television instead . ‘It does worry me that the amount of time that parents spend with children in the UK is also one of the relatively lower ones within Europe,’ he said. ‘I wonder if we are leaving children too much to their own devices as opposed to spending time with them, and therefore screens take over.’ Mr Bailey said a 2011 Unicef study that monitored families in Spain, Sweden and the UK had shown British parents spend far less time talking to their children than their European counterparts do. ‘What was really noticeable was how few of the British families had a dining table or a kitchen table,’ he told The Independent. ‘They tended to sit around the television and eat meals on on their laps, whereas both the Swedish and the Spanish families had a meal round the table and spent a lot of time just talking.’ He added: ‘I think it perhaps tells you something about the amount of face-to-face time which is spent in British families. Mr Cameron wants music videos to be given age ratings to help protect children . ‘People talk sometimes about “quality time”, and actually I think most children don’t really need quality time. They need you to be there to talk informally all the time.’ He also told the paper that he feels retail stores should be given stickers according to how ‘family friendly’ their products are. Mr Bailey was commissioned to lead a review into how to protect children from an increasingly sexualised society shortly after the last election. Mr Cameron last week announced that online music videos will be given age ratings to help protect children from highly sexual and violent content, which was one of Mr Bailey’s recommendations. The Prime Minister said families were ‘endlessly worried’ about what their children could find on the internet as he announced the crackdown on sleazy music videos. During his speech, Mr Cameron said that he was concerned as a parent about how much ‘screen time’ his own children – Nancy, ten, Elwen, eight, and three-year-old Florence – have. He said: ‘As for my own children, I am sure there are times when they have been disappointed because they haven’t been able to do something or see something. ‘But that is part of what being a parent is about, being able to deploy the use of the word “no” and even sometimes to deploy the use of the off switch on the television, as unpopular as that might be – and sometimes ineffectual because they find another screen somewhere that is switched on.’","Reg Bailey, chief executive of Mother's Union, said screens are 'taking over'

"Faf du Plessis impressed with the bat during two strong partnerships as South Africa claimed a six-wicket victory over Australia in the Zimbabwe Triangular Series final in Harare. Du Plessis finished the match just four runs off his century after sharing a second-wicket stand of 98 with Hashim Amla and a fourth-wicket partnership of 91 with AB de Villiers - who both recorded half centuries - as South Africa reached their target with 55 balls remaining. Earlier on Aaron Finch claimed a half-century in Australia's innings total of 217 for nine in which Dale Steyn claimed bowling figures of four for 34 after South Africa captain De Villiers had won the toss and elected to field in this 50 overs match. Drink to that: Faf du Plessis celebrates being named player of the series after top-scoring in South Africa's final win over Australia . Both sides made a single change to their starting XI as South Africa's Imran Tahir came in for Rilee Rossouw, while James Faulkner replaced the injured Kane Richardson for Australia. Opener Finch got Australia off to a strong start and the 27-year-old Melbourne Renegades captain recorded his 50 off 72 balls including five fours. Fellow opener Phillip Hughes also started brightly as he hit Morne Morkel for two fours off the second over, but his stint at the crease was cut short when he became Steyn's first victim as he was caught by De Villiers at short cover for 15. Four overs later Hughes' replacement Steve Smith (10) joined him after David Miller took an easy catch running in from mid-on off Wayne Parnell's bowling, while Geroge Bailey (12) was next to lose his wicket cheaply when he was bowled by Tahir to leave Australia 82 for three. Shining light: Opener Aaron Finch was the only Aussie to reach 50 as they set a paltry 217 batting first . On your toes: Finch evades a fierce delivery from a South African quick in the first innings in Harare . Middle stump: Dale Steyn celebrates the massive wicket of Finch as he knocks centre peg out of the ground . Finch and Mitchell Marsh started to pile on the runs before the former and his replacement Glenn Maxwell were both out with the score stuck on 115. Finch (54) went first after Steyn took out his middle stump and Maxwell (nought) followed lbw in the next ball to Steyn. Brad Haddin joined Marsh at the crease but Steyn failed to claim his hat-trick and Marsh (27) was bowled out by Parnell, before Haddin (six) fell lbw to Steyn and Mitchell Johnson (six) was caught by Aaron Phangiso at the boundary off Morkel to leave the Aussies struggling on 144 for eight. But an impressive ninth-wicket stand of 71 from Faulkner (39) and Mitchell Starc (29) saw them rack up a respectable total before the former - who hit four fours from his 37 balls - became Morkel's second victim, caught at long on by Miller. In response South Africa began to get some massive runs on the board, despite losing Quinton de Kock early for just seven. On fire: Veteran quick Dale Steyn claimed 4-35 in a brutal 10 overs for South Africa . Chasing down: Du Plessis hit a timely 96 from 99 balls in the Proteas successful chase . Milestone: Du Plessis raises his bat after he was dismissed having laid the platform for victory . The 21-year-old opener, who hit a four off Maxwell in the second over, became the Australia bowler's victim two overs later as he was caught by Bailey at cover to leave his side 14 for one. But fellow opener Amla (51) and Du Plessis steadied the ship with a second-wicket partnership of 98 to bring South Africa to 112 before the former lost his wicket - also caught by Bailey at cover - off Smith. Parnell (six) joined Du Plessis at the crease but he only lasted five overs before he was bowled out by Faulkner after chopping the ball onto his stumps leaving South Africa needing 92 runs with 23 overs remaining. Captain De Villiers (57 not out) took to the field and built up a fourth-wicket partnership with Du Plessis (96), who scored eight fours and one maximum from his 99 balls but lost his wicket in the penultimate ball of the match, caught by Faulkner off Johnson, as between them they put on 91 and saw South Africa past their target to 221 for four to claim the victory.

"The parents of a Scottish private schoolgirl who travelled to Syria to join Islamic fighters have begged for her to return home – but not before telling her she has 'betrayed' the family. Aqsa Mahmood, 20, left her Glasgow home in November after becoming radicalised and fled to Syria where she married an ISIS fighter, her family said. Their desperate plea came the day after footage emerged of a second American journalist - Steven Sotloff - being beheaded by extremists in the desert, and as the British Government hardened its stance against the brutal Islamic State amid terror warnings at home. Scroll down for video . Khalida Mahmood wiped away tears as solicitor Aamer Anwar read a statement on her and her husband's behalf at a press conference in Glasgow . Muzaffar and Mrs Mahmood, the parents of Scottish schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood who fled to Syria to join Islamic fighters, issued a statement today (pictured above with solicitor Aamer Anwar) begging for her return . Aqsa Mahmood, 20, left her  home in Glasgow, Scotland, last November after becoming radicalised and fled to Syria where she married an ISIS fighter. Her family described her today as 'sweet, peaceful and intelligent' Her parents, Muzaffar and Khalida, said they were horrified that their 'sweet, peaceful, intelligent' child had joined jihadists in Syria and had hoped she would become a doctor in Britain. In a statement issued today, they said she had 'betrayed' the family but begged for her to return home. They said: 'We still love you, Aqsa, but we now have to put your family, your brother and sisters first as you have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step. 'You have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever. Please come home.' They added: 'Aqsa was always a very sweet, peaceful, intelligent child and inquisitive about everything. 'We had high hopes for her and would have loved for her to be a doctor and to save lives. 'We dreamed that one day we would see her married with children but sadly that no longer looks likely. 'We have not seen our daughter since November of last year and can confirm that on her disappearance we immediately contacted Police Scotland and are grateful for their continued support. 'We found out ourselves within days that she had travelled through Turkey to Syria and subsequently married an ISIS fighter in February this year. 'As parents we would have liked for her to listen to us but we gave her everything possible in terms of love, freedom and education and she chose the path which we could never approve of. 'All parents want to be proud of their children but sadly we now feel nothing but sorrow and shame for Aqsa. At the press conference, her parents said she had been brought up 'with love and affection in a happy home' 'We are not in denial and do not make any excuses for her and absolutely condemn her involvement in ISIS and recent comments. 'But she is our daughter and we still love her, fear for her life and would urge her to return home while she still can. 'She may believe that the jihadists of ISIS are her new family but they are not and are simply using her.' The couple also confirmed that their daughter had been keeping in touch with them through social media since fleeing Britain, but said they had not heard from her since yesterday when her involvement with ISIS was revealed. Mrs Mahmood wiped away tears as Mr Anwar read the statement on her and her husband's behalf at a press conference in Glasgow. Mr Anwar said: 'She contacted them by phone [seven days after she left] to tell them that she had reached [Syria] and then they contacted the police to say she had phoned from Syria. 'She informed her family that she went from Turkey to Syria and that's the information we have. 'Because of yesterday, all contact appears to have terminated with their daughter. 'So, they are hoping that this plea will go out to their daughter and that she will think again and return home. 'They want her to come home while she still can. They are telling her that she is wrong, that she is deluded if she thinks she is helping people in Syria. 'With regards to the practicalities of it and how exactly that was done, clearly she must have received assistance in order to do that, and the family are not naive, but everybody is well aware that those who are travelling into Syria are receiving assistance in order to do that.' In a message to Aqsa, Muzaffar (right) and Khalida (left) said: 'You have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever. Please come home.' They also said she had 'betrayed' the family by fleeing to Syria . The solicitor said Aqsa, a British national, had become 'concerned and upset' by media and online reports of the killing in Syria and had told her parents she wanted to help. Her parents, who are liaising with Police Scotland, said: 'ISIS are killing in the name of religion and claiming to defend the weak, but by joining with them our daughter is brainwashed and deluded and helping those engaged in genocide. 'There is no smoking gun, no family member, no fundamentalist preacher that can be blamed for her radicalisation. 'Aqsa, like many young people in our community, was naturally angry and frustrated at the loss of innocent life in the Middle East but this is not the way to help. 'We are concerned that a growing climate of fear in this country means that children will not discuss how they feel with their family and friends, and this will only spell disaster for society. 'We know that in the days and months ahead we will be scouring social media for clues of whether our daughter is still alive. 'As we try to hold back the tears today, we feel we have lost our child.' Mr Mahmood appeared emotionally defeated throughout the press conference and only occasionally clarified a few points with Mr Anwar. Responding to questions, Mr Anwar said Aqsa had left her brother and sisters 'distressed, upset and torn apart'. He added that while her family have branded her a 'bedroom radical', 'she is safe to return home and her family will open their door to her and take her back'. Aqsa's mother Khalida sobbed throughout the press conference which was held in Glasgow, Scotland, today . In a statement Aqsa's parents said they had hoped she would become a doctor and wanted to see her married . In reference to David Cameron's plans to void and seize the passports of extremists, Mr Anwar said that it would not apply to her as she does not have dual citizenship. He said that because Aqsa is a British national and 'not a dual national', she would not be affected by the proposals and so could 'return home at any time and that door is still open to her'. He said: 'My understanding is that the police are also saying that she should return before it's too late. Mr and Mrs Mahmood also warned of others becoming radicalised in Britain, adding: 'If our daughter, who had all the chances and freedom in life, could become a bedroom radical, then it is possible for this to happen to any family.' Privately-educated Aqsa is reported to have encouraged terrorist acts via a Twitter account under the name Umm Layth – which carries a picture of the black flag of brutal terrorist group ISIS. In a series of radical messages she encouraged others to copy the shocking murder of soldier Lee Rigby, the Boston Marathon bombing and the massacre at the Fort Hood US Army base in Texas. The account has since been deleted. She travelled through Turkey to Aleppo in Syria in November and was reported missing to police. Before disappearing she attended the prestigious private Craigholme School before enrolling at Glasgow Caledonian University to study diagnostic radiology. She was 'well integrated into society', her parents said, and had been brought up 'with love and affection in a happy home'. Police Scotland and the security services have previously confirmed they are aware of Aqsa. The couple (right) were accompanied by their lawyer Aamer Anwar (left0 who read the statement to the Press . Muzaffar and Khalida Mahmood walked hand-in-hand as they left the press conference in Glasgow today . Friends and family have previously told of their shock of her involvement with radical Islam and her decision to travel to Syria. One ex-school friend said: 'She wasn't different. She got on with everybody. As soon as she decided to do something she would never change her mind. I guess that was something that was amazing about her, but also one of her downfalls.' Another school friend said she was a 'usual, typical girl', adding: 'At school she had a lot of friends. She was a really confident person, she could talk to anyone she wanted, clever as well.' 'I would say she was a moderate Muslim. I find it really bizarre, knowing her from school and then her suddenly being part of Islamic State.' Friends did not know she had travelled to the Middle East, although Mahmood, who was very interested in politics, had spoken about wanting to go there to 'help' in the fight against Bashar Assad's regime. A security source said the Glasgow girl was one of an increasing number of western women travelling to Syria in order to provide a support network for organisations such as Islamic State.","Glasgow-born Aqsa Mahmood, 20, fled Britain to join Islamic fighters in Syria .

"Denver Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker has denied taking MDMA after being suspended for the first four games of the 2014 season for testing positive for amphetamines. Welker violated the NFL's performance-enhancing substances policy but wrote an email to the Denver Post denying taking the party drug. 'I wouldn't have any idea where to get a Molly or what a Molly is', Welker wrote. Wes Welker (pictured in August) denies that he knowingly took an illegal substance . 'That's a joke. I don't do marijuana, I don't do drugs. I don't do any drugs', he added. It was alleged that Welker consumed MDMA at the Kentucky Derby, to which he said that someone must have slipped it into his drink, without him knowing. The league never makes public what substances athletes test positive for but another report alleged it was the banned stimulant Adderall, a drug prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), found in his system. In his email to the Post, Welker said he was 'as shocked as everyone' and would fight to clear his name. 'I would NEVER knowingly take a substance to gain a competitive advantage in any way,' he said. 'I have never been concerned with the league's performance enhancing or drug abuse policies because under no scenario would they ever apply to me. 'But I now know that (drug-policy procedures) are clearly flawed, and I will do everything in my power to ensure they are corrected, so other individuals and teams aren't negatively affected so rashly like this.' The news comes just five days before the Broncos, who lost last season's Super Bowl, begin their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts. 'Tonight's news regarding Wes is very disappointing for our team, but we understand the league's authority in this area,' Denver coach John Fox said on the team's official website. 'I have no doubt that Wes will remain focused on his preparations for the season and stay in excellent shape during his time away from the team.' Welker, who has been to the Pro Bowl five times, is a key receiver for Denver quarterback Peyton Manning and made 778 yards on 73 receptions last year.

"An unlicensed driver accused of killing a 4-year-old while fleeing police last year has again been charged with a crime behind the wheel — this time injuring a police officer while bolting from a weekend traffic stop, authorities said. Franklin Reyes, 18, made an illegal turn Sunday evening and refused to put the SUV in park when an officer asked him to, police said. One officer had reached through a passenger-side window to try to put the vehicle in park when Reyes sped off, and the officer was dragged about a block. The New York Daily News reported the police officer, identified as Edward O'Connell, was led 100 feet by Reyes' vehicle and that his elbow and wrist were injured. Scroll down for video . Reckless: Police say Franklin Reyes made an illegal turn Sunday evening and refused to put the SUV in park when an officer asked him to - then sped off, dragging the officer 100 feet with him . Not the first crime: Reyes reportedly struck and killed Ariel Russo, pictured, in a driving accident last June . The young driver hit a second car and sped off, The News reported. Police said Reyes was arrested after he ditched the car in a parking garage and hid in the office. 'When I attempted to arrest the defendant, he refused to put his hands behind his back, swung his arms up and down, and kicked his legs,' Officer Richard Natal said in a police report obtained by the newspaper. His lawyer didn't immediately return a message from the Associated Press seeking comment. The New York Post revealed Reyes' lawyer Martin Schmukler said 'His mother had driven him to the home of a relative. She left the vehicle behind to go somewhere else.' 'The other occupants of the home left...and the defendant, feeling lonely and by himself, felt the best thing he could do was just simply take the car and go home,' he continued. 'His better judgement failed him and he got into the car.' The Manhattan district attorney's office said Reyes was being held without bail after his arraignment on assault and other charges and is due back in court Friday. Reyes is awaiting trial on a manslaughter charge in the death of Ariel Russo last year. Heartbroken: Ariel Russo's parents, Sofia and Alan Russo, were outraged following the discovery Reyes was behind the wheel again . Robbery: Reyes has also been accused of taking jewelry, cash and wine from a dead woman's apartment . Authorities said he had taken his parents' car without permission and was fleeing officers who were trying to stop him from driving erratically. The SUV jumped a curb and hit a building, pinning Ariel and striking her grandmother, who survived. Russo's mother, Sofia Russo, told The New York Daily News 'I keep having this nightmare over and over that [my son] Jacob ... and I get hit by a car — and it’s [Reyes] driving.' 'It’s just this terrible nightmare I have over and over,' Reyes continued. 'And it’s like it came true — he did something again!' Reyes has also been accused of taking jewelry, cash and wine from a dead woman's apartment in July. His attorney has said that Reyes denies taking anything and was helping his father, the building superintendent, with a plumbing leak. Reyes' father was charged with similar crimes. Altogether, the merchandise was worth at least $19,000, The Post reported. The judge overseeing Reyes' cases had offered the teen a deal where he'd receive a maximum of four years behind bars in Russo's death and the chance to have his case eventually sealed.He faced up 15 years in prison if convicted at trial. It's unclear if his latest arrest will affect the proposal. Sanford Rubenstein, an attorney for Ariel Russo's parents, said Wednesday that the family was outraged. 'That offer should be revoked. He should stand trial in every case that he has,' Rubenstein told the Associated Press.","Franklin Reyes, 18, made an illegal turn Sunday evening and refused to put the SUV in park when an officer asked him to, police said .

"A tourist had to be rescued from a mountainside via helicopter after she attempted to climb  the 7,109ft-high Dobratsch Mountain in flip-flops. Maria Schneider, 23, from Vienna, was trying to hike the peak, near Villach, Austria, when she got stuck and was unable to go any further. And she was also unable to get back down due to her unsuitable footwear. Stuck: Maria had to be rescued by a police helicopter while climbing the Dobratsch mountain . When rescuers arrived on the steep mountainside they also found Schneider was not dressed for the walk correctly and did not have any warm clothing nor Alpine equipment with her. A police helicopter, eight mountain rescuers, and an Alpine policeman were used in the rescue. The woman was airlifted off the peak and was uninjured in the ordeal. Summer sees many rescues from mountainsides from people ill-equipped for the conditions. Only last week a British soldier who tackled the frozen Austrian Alps wearing just shorts and a T-shirt had been rapped by officials after he had to be rescued from the snowy peak. Long way down: The tourist had to be rescued while attempting the 7,000ft high Dobratsch mountain . Rescuers in Hohe Tauern, a mountain range near the western city of Salzburg, say the 37-year-old man had ignored warnings that he could freeze to death wearing kit more suitable for a day the beach than a mountain top. Conditions were so bad that a helicopter rescue was abandoned when the chopper could not fly high enough to reach the climber who was 10,100 feet up the mountain. Officials say he was warned when he reached an Alpine hut at 7,100 feet that he could die if he went any higher in his T-shirt, shorts, and trainers. But he ignored the warning and climbed a further thousand metres before he called for help. After the helicopter rescue was abandoned, local climbers braved snow and ice falls to rescue the stricken soldier, who was taken back down to the nearest rescue hut.","Maria Schneider got stuck while climbing Dobratsch Mountain, Austria .

"Joseph Fox Batista was sentenced to 10 years in prison  and ordered to pay $40,000 to six investors . A conman who duped investors into buying at least $380,000 worth of yogurt-based anti-aging cream has been sentenced to a decade in prison. Joseph Fox Batista, 59, managed to convince buyers that his bogus cream could combat aging and promote hair regrowth. A  jury last week convicted the self-described microbiologist from South Beach, Florida, of second-degree grand theft, the Miami Herald reported. He was  sentenced to 10 years in prison plus five years of probation and ordered to pay $40,000 to six investors. His yogurt cream claimed to regrow hair on balding men, get rid of grey hair and generally reverse the whole aging process. His pitch was based around an enzyme known as telomerase, which was discovered in the early 1980s and is thought to slow the decline of the body's cells. But scientists say research is still basic and has not shown that successfully introducing the enzyme into the body can reverse aging. In a 2011 interview with the Miami Herald, Fox -who claimed he was the nephew of former Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista - insisted he never stole money. He claimed that shadowy forces, including the hair-transplant industry, were conspiring to hold back his company, Telogenesis Inc. 'Obviously, I have to be paid. I'm the CEO of a corporation.

He claimed that the money from investors was used for lab testing, clinical trials, production and marketing. But after combing through bank records and interviewing victims, it was found that most of the cash invested from July 2007 to November 2009 went toward Fox's daily living expenses, including alcohol, drugs and lavish meals for friends. In 2002, Fox was convicted in California of ripping off investors after promising a machine that claimed to weigh the amount of gold in any object. 'He had so much faith in himself.

"Floyd Mayweather posted pictures online of the earnings from his last two fights, which were worth over $72million. Not known for his modesty, the five-division world champion posted the images on his Twitter account. The 37-year-old beat Mexican Saul Alvarez in September last year and in May this year he defeated Argentinian boxer Marcos Maidana. The pictures showed two cheques -  one worth $31,406,000 (£18,950,672), and the other $40,870,000 (£24,661,337). Meaning his combined income for the two fights came to $72,276,000 (£43,612,009). the pictures were accompanied by the words: 'God bless'.

"A mother-and-son team have become one of the driving forces behind what has been described as a 'rubber dolling craze' by manufacturing and selling full female body suits to men who choose to live as female dolls. Adam Ramos and his mother currently cater to 400,000 transgender and cross-dressing people across the world. Mr Ramos, from Florida, who oversees the making of dozens of silicone body suits a week, inherited the business from his father, who came up with the idea after watching a TV show called 'RealDoll'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A mother and son are making a roaring trade selling full female body suits to men who choose to live as female rubber dolls. Pictured is 'Robby', a 70-year-old estate agent who dresses up as 'Sherry' Robby has now found notoriety as his female fantasy alter ego, but it was not until he reached the age of 50 that he began dressing as a woman and fantasising about having a female body . Robby started wearing women's clothes in private, but started putting on the full body suit after discovering FemSkin. Robby can be seen dressing up into a full length female bodysuit (right) and wearing one of the suits (left) The show featured life-size dolls that certain men enjoy romantic and sexual relationships with. He then saw an online forum discussing 'RealDoll' and found there was a demand for men wanting similar lifelike doll suits. Mr Ramos decided to seize the opportunity and FemSkin was born. Each of the body suits, which cost up to $1,850, takes about four hours to complete and weighs roughly 12 pounds. Adam Ramos, who says he takes great pride in making his work look realistic, also produces custom orders from people with burns or scars. He refuses however to create masks, because he believes they will always look unrealistic.

Unlike transgender people, ‘maskers’, or ‘rubber dollers’ as they’re also known, do not feel born in the wrong body. For them, dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is simply a way to have fun. At the time the documentary was publicised, Adam Ramos' mother Barbie Ramos, the owner of FemSkin, said: ‘They’re not freaky people, they’re not weird, they’re just like you and me. ‘They’re just like what they call “vanilla people” - that’s you and me - except for at night or on special occasions, they like to put on a mask.

"A Florida teen has been arrested on a homicide charge after cops found his mother's rotting corpse inside the trailer home they shared more than a week after she went missing. Deputies with the Lee County Sheriff's Office were responding to a report of a foul odor coming from a North Fort Myers mobile home on Sunday when they found the body of Tamara Davis, 42. Her 15-year-old son Tyrese Landrum, was arrested later that same day, the Naples Daily News reported. Davis' live-in boyfriend Marcos Casiano, 49, said she was last seen on Aug. 21, before disappearing from the home at the end of a long night of drinking, according to the News-Press. Tyrese Landrum (left), 15, is being held on a homicide charge after sheriff's deputies in Lee County, Florida, found the rotting corpse of his mother Tamara Davis (right), 42, inside the home they shared. She had been missing for 10 days . Casiano said he left a heavily intoxicated Davis showering about 11pm while he went to walk their dogs. When he came back, the shower was still running —but she was nowhere to be found, the News-Press reported. Neighbors say Casiano and the woman's son continued to live in the house for the next 10 days, all while a rancid smell spread throughout the neighborhood . 'Twenty buzzards were sitting in the tree outside,' neighbor Forrest Baumgardt told the Naples Daily News. The 15-year-old Landrum said he had no idea what the smell could be. 'He said it was probably a dead cat,' family friend Debra Coe told WINK News. 'He said cat, raccoon, whatever,' she added. 'He said that's happened before where they get stuck under the house, under the lattice, but it was definitely a disturbing — it was terrible.' Neighbors said they'd often hear fights coming from the house. 'They’d holler,' Baumgardt told the Naples Daily News. 'But they’d only fight with their mouths.' Casiano said Davis has a criminal record and a history of abusing drugs and alcohol, the News-Press reported. She had attempted suicide years ago, according to the website. Landrum is being held without bond at a juvenile detention center.","Tyrese Landrum is being held in a juvenile detention center in Florida on a homicide charge following his mother's death .

"Battle-hardened jihadists who have fought alongside extremist Al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria's civil war are returning to live among us in Europe, the EU's anti-terror chief has warned. The number of fighters travelling back and forth from war-torn country is increasing, stressed guidance prepared by the office of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove. Drawn by recruiters who arrange travel and accommodation, these men are learning to fight, being indoctrinated with the tenets of militant Islam, and could pose a potent threat once back home. A 21-year-old from Denmark poses for a photo with an AK47 rifle in at a training camp near Aleppo in Syria. The EU anti-terror chief warns that increasing numbers of jihadis are returning battle-hardened from the war . Moreover, Syrian rebels are often seen as heroes to a small section of youths upon return, making them ideal to further foster recruitment, warns a note prepared for a meeting of EU interior ministers today. The note, seen by The Associated Press, specifically calls for better use of airline passenger information available to security officials to keep track of when and how rebels move to Syria. But a new law that could make it easier to share information remains stuck in the European Parliament while MEPs debate the wholesale snooping on EU citizens revealed by U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden. The 11 western European countries with the biggest contingents in Syria are estimated to have some 1,200-1,700 citizens among rebel forces, according to government and analyst figures compiled by the Associated Press. That compares to estimates of 600-800 from those countries in late spring. 'There are cases where individuals continue travelling back and forth,' the note for the ministers said. Belgian Interior Minister Joelle . Milquet organized an international gathering on the subject with a dozen . counterparts on the eve of the EU meeting. 'We . have to anticipate the returns (of fighters from Syria), the ways to . handle this, the prevention measures and especially the exchange of . information on the travels,' she said. A Free Syrian Army fighter runs to avoid snipers . loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad in Aleppo: Syrian rebels are seen as heroes to a small section of youths upon return to their . home countries in western Europe . The head of MI5, the UK's domestic spying agency, last month said 'low hundreds of people' had travelled from Britain to Syria and that some have since returned - stoking fears extremists could pose a domestic threat. Some of them, said Britain's counter-terror chief Helen Ball on Wednesday, 'decided to get themselves trained to use weapons or build bombs and engage in fighting' 'They are not some romantic freedom fighters,' said Ms Ball. EU interior ministers will also be looking at ways to cooperate more closely with Turkey, Syria's neighbour, through which most of the fighters move to get join with Syrian rebel units. 'The EU should offer to assist Turkey in improving controls at borders and airports and should do more to help in preventing radicalisation of individuals, especially in refugee camps,' the note said. Home Secretary Theresa May speaks with Swedish minister of Justice Beatrice Ask prior to the meeting of EU interior ministers for which the office of the EU's anti-terror chief prepared the guidance on Syria . The Mail On Sunday revealed last weekend how one British man who was killed fighting alongside Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Syria funded his trip by mugging people in an affluent area of London. Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, threatened victims with a Taser-style high-voltage stun gun and forced them to hand over valuables including designer watches and mobile phones. He lived in London until a year ago when he skipped bail and travelled to Syria to join a group of Islamic extremists waging war on President Assad’s regime. Now it has been revealed that he was one of three British men killed as their group attacked pro-government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11. The trio were part of a group of ten British jihadists who joined up with  20 other Britons to fight with the Al-Nusra Front, which is allied to Al Qaeda. A senior EU official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that beyond the fighters from the 28-nation EU, there were also some 500 from Balkan nations, highlighting the contribution from small nations like Bosnia and Kosovo. 'Kosovo has 80 to 100 for two million people,' he said. The official said the total number of EU fighters could be well above 1,000, bringing it roughly in line with the AP assessment.","Numbers of fighters travelling back and forth from Syria are increasing .

"Strolling outside his Rotherham home, one of the few men convicted over the grooming scandal was free to walk the street last night. Mohsin Khan, 26, has been released from prison less than four years after he was convicted of grooming a 13-year-old girl for sex. He is now able to walk freely through the town where he and four accomplices sexually exploited teenage girls. Scroll down for video . Free: Mohsin Khan walks the streets of Rotherham yesterday. He was given a four-year jail sentence for grooming a girl of 13, but has now been released . Meanwhile his victim – and hundreds of others like her – are forced to live in fear. Many are forced to endure the fact that their abusers never faced justice as a result of shocking blunders by police and council workers. His freedom last night became a symbol of the catastrophic failure to protect vulnerable girls in the town from abusers. Now, police in Rotherham are facing searching questions about how they are going to catch the ‘hundreds of child rapists’ who are thought to be still at large. The South Yorkshire force pledged to ‘relentlessly’ bring the sex predators to justice after a damning report exposed the abuse suffered by at least 1,400 girls at the hands of Asian men. But serious concerns over its ability to conduct such complex investigations have been raised because of its appalling failures in such cases to date. A lawyer representing the victims said police had missed ‘clear opportunities’ to bring sex offenders to justice. There has been only one successful prosecution, in 2010, for sexual offences by Asian men against Rotherham girls. This resulted in the conviction of five British-born Pakistani men – including Khan. To outsiders, he lived a reputable, middle-class life. By the age of 20, he had secured a job as a mortgage advisor, owned two semi-detached houses and ran a cafe and several other businesses. But beneath the facade of respectability, Khan was living a life of depravity. In 2008 he began grooming the 13-year-old girl for sex. He gave her cannabis, drove her around in one of his two cars, and persuaded her that they had a future together. His victim later told police that he spoiled her ‘like a princess’. Despite being well aware of her tender age, he promised the child they would settle down together. But when he had gained the girl’s trust, he went on to viciously assault her, raping her in the car he had first used to impress her. When his crime finally came to light, he told police he had only given her a lift. He told officers: ‘She looked no more than ten or 11 years old – the same age as my little brother. ‘There’s no way I’d touch her.’ Khan received a jail sentence of four years and was placed on the sex offenders register. Last night, he was already out on the streets of his hometown. By contrast, Khan’s victim, who had been abused by five different Asian men, said at the trial: ‘I don’t think I will ever be able to return to Rotherham and feel safe without looking over my shoulder.’ The 26-year-old gave the girl cannabis, drove her around in one of his two cars and promised her they had a future together . David Greenwood of Switalskis Solicitors, who is representing 15 of the victims in a class action against the police, said yesterday: ‘South Yorkshire Police failed to act on information which could have led to the arrest of perpetrators.’ Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale who exposed the Cyril Smith scandal, said urgent action was needed to catch the criminals who have committed ‘appalling child sex abuse on an industrial scale’. ‘There are many, many other perpetrators of this type of crime out there – hundreds of child rapists out there,’ he said. ‘What are South Yorkshire Police doing to catch these people?’ No police officer has yet been sacked or disciplined over the failures in Rotherham. The two chief constables at the helm during the height of the failings have since left on hefty pensions. The devastating Rotherham report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed how officers from South Yorkshire Police treated victims with ‘contempt’. They turned a blind eye to their plight and in many cases held them responsible. This included the case of an 11-year-old who was viewed by police as having ‘consensual sex’ with an adult man.","Mohsin Khan, from Rotherham, jailed in 2010 for grooming girl, 13, for sex .

"Millions of pounds of British aid money has been spent on building roads in Africa that were never finished or which are doomed to fall into disrepair, a report warns today. A major study of the £1.4billion a year of British taxpayers’ money channelled through the European Union’s aid budget, warns that the Government has little control over how it is spent, despite major concerns about waste, corruption and excessive bureaucracy. The Independent Commission on Aid Impact gave the EU aid programme an ‘amber-red’ rating on its traffic light system, suggesting it ‘performs poorly’ on value for money and effectiveness, and needs ‘significant improvements’. In Uganda the EU has now built so many roads that the network is 'well beyond the size and standard the country can afford to maintain' In a report today it singles out the approach to funding new roads in Africa, which have benefited from hundreds of millions of pounds of aid money. In Mozambique, the EU set aside £60million to build a 60-mile stretch of road which would provide a missing link between the major port of Quelimane and the Malawian border. Officials spent two years dithering over the award of the contract, during which time the cost of materials rose by more than 40 per cent. The result of the delay was that the money ran out, halting construction of the road four miles short of the town of Milange on the border with Malawi. In Uganda the EU has now built so many roads that the network is ‘well beyond the size and standard the country can afford to maintain’. Today’s report expresses surprise that the EU ‘does not have a specific definition of value for money’, with the result that it does not bother to keep track of the issue. In Mozambique, the EU set aside £60 million to build a 60-mile stretch of road between the major port of Quelimane and the Malawian border . It also warns that neither the EU, nor the Department for International Development (Dfid) are doing enough to clamp down on corruption. Researchers visited Mozambique, Uganda and Tajikistan to assess how well the EU spends aid money on our behalf. In one unnamed country researchers came across numerous allegations that a senior Government official was siphoning off millions of pounds of aid money. ‘We remain concerned that the influence of this individual poses a challenge to the safeguarding of donor funds,’ the report says. The Department for International Development last night said Secretary Justine Greening shared concerns about the way the EU aid budget is spent . But neither the EU nor Dfid are currently investigating because they have not received a formal complaint. In a withering assessment, today’s report says: ‘There is no effective performance management system in place for EU aid, which limits Dfid’s oversight. ‘The EU’s performance management and results framework are weak. As a result, Dfid is not getting the assurance it needs and that it achieves elsewhere, for example from the World Bank. ‘Slow decision-making and processes hamper the delivery of results. Limitations to the EU’s risk management approach, as well as over-ambitious project plans, are a significant obstacle to improving the performance of its programmes and projects.’ Dfid last night said International Development Secretary Justine Greening shared concerns about the way the EU aid budget is spent. Officials said they would now investigate the allegations of corruption raised by the report. In a statement, a spokesman for the department said: ‘We agree that the EU needs to raise its game. That’s why Justine Greening is already pressing EU institutions, MEPs and other member states to improve performance and results. Nothing in the EU happens overnight but we are determined to get better value for money on behalf of the British taxpayer.’ Meanwhile, in a separate report last night the charity War on Want accused ministers of using aid money to support the interests of multinationals rather than meeting the needs of the world’s poor. It said that support for initiatives in Africa by global food corporations was disadvantaging local farmers and could even lead to increased poverty. War on Want’s executive director John Hilary said: ‘The expansion of corporate control over farming will increase vulnerability among the world’s poorest communities, deepening poverty and hunger for years to come. Dfid should be using the aid budget to support small-scale farming in Africa, not boosting the profits of big business.’","In Mozambique, the EU set aside £60million to build a 60-mile stretch of road that was never finished .

"Xavi gave former manager Pep Guardiola a resounding 'no' when offered the chance to join Bayern Munich this summer. The German champions were willing to double Xavi's wages to lure him away from Barcelona, according to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo. But the midfield master, who has been at the Nou Camp for his entire career, firmly declined the offer to end his career in Bavaria. Turned down: Mundo Deportivo report that Xavi turned down the chance of a reunion with former manager Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich during the summer to remain with Barcelona . Having failed to entice 34-year-old Xavi, Guardiola turned his attentions to Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso, eventually signing him for a fee in the region of £5m. Mundo report that Xavi was unwilling to sign for a side that might come into direct competition with Barcelona and is more receptive to a move to the Middle East or United States when he finally decides to leave. AS, meanwhile, feature Cristiano Ronaldo on their front cover as he fights to be fit in time for Saturday night's Madrid derby with Atletico. A combination of knee and thigh injuries saw Ronaldo rested for Real Madrid's last match against Real Sociedad and he wasn't risked in Portugal's Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Albania at the weekend. Back in training: Real Madrid are optimistic Cristiano Ronaldo will make Saturday's derby with Atletico . But the forward returned to full training with Real on Tuesday alongside the likes of Toni Kroos, Fabio Coentrao, Pepe, Iler Casillas and Karim Benzema. The paper also reports that Atletico requested 250 tickets for the match at Santiago Bernabeu but have so far only sold 30 of them. Marca pick up on Gareth Bale's double for Wales in their opening qualifier with Andorra, saying the Real man was 'charged with dynamite'. At the foot of the page, Paco Alcacer, the Valencia striker who scored his first goal for Spain in their match with Macedonia on Monday, is described as the 'bargain of Europe'. Alcacer has a release clause of just £14.5m, which could spark a bidding war in the next transfer window. At the double: Marca lead on basketball but feature Gareth Bale's two goals for Wales against Andorra . The Italian sports dailies reflect on a satisfying 2-0 win for Italy in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier with Norway, with Simone Zaza and Leonardo Bonucci on target. Gazzetta dello Sport have the headline 'ItalConte, what strength!' and say Antonio Conte's ideas have already revitalised the national side, praising their pressing, integrity and organisation in the match. They praise Zaza, who was brought in for the suspended Mario Balotelli, and call his powerful finish in the 16th minute the highlight of the night. They're not Conte's concern any more, but Juventus have an injury scare with Arturo Vidal and the midfielder, a target for Man United over the summer, will miss Saturday's home match with Udinese with a muscle problem. Strength: Gazzetta dello Sport was delighted with Italy's win over Norway in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier . Corriere dello Sport concurs with Gazzetta, it's headline reading: 'We like this Italy.' They believe that Conte has already shaped a 'solid and gritty' squad in his own mould and also praised Zaza on his competitive debut. Zlatan Ibrahimovic could also face a lengthy ban for his elbow on Austria's David Alaba in Monday's Euro qualifier, something picked up by many of the papers. Impressed: Corriere was also delighted with the performance, praising manager Antonio Conte . Austria's players said the referee, Pavel Kralovec, was scared of the Sweden striker and didn't want to send him off. The disastrous World Cup seems a long time ago, say Tuttosport, as they hail a 'fine' Italy performance on their front page. Juve, meanwhile, could offer Stephan Lichtsteiner to Paris Saint-Germain in order to secure the signing of Adrien Rabiot, who is also wanted by Roma.

"Peering through a wire fence, this group of African American children stare out longingly at a fun fair just out of reach in one of a series of stunning photographs depicting the racial divides which split the United States of America. The image, entitled 'Outside Looking In' was captured by photographer Gordon Parks and was taken as part of a photo essay illustrating the lives of a Southern family living under the tyranny of Jim Crow segregation. Parks' pictures, which first appeared in Life Magazine in 1956 under the title 'The Restraints: Open and Hidden', have been reprinted by Steidl for a book featuring the collective works of the artist, who died in 2006. Outsiders: This vivid photograph entitled 'Outside Looking In' was taken at the height of segregation in the United States of America . Caring: An African American maid grips hold of her young charge in a waiting area as a smartly-dressed white woman looks on . The vivid color images focused on the extended family of Mr and Mrs Albert Thornton who lived in Mobile, Alabama during segregation in the Southern states. In another photograph, taken inside an airline terminal in Atlanta, Georgia, an African American maid can be seen clutching onto a young baby, as a white woman watches on - a single seat with a teddy bear on it dividing them. Many white families hired black maids to care for their children, clean their homes, and cook their food. Controversial rules, dubbed the Jim Crow laws meant that all public facilities in the Southern states of the former Confederacy had to be segregated. The laws, which were enacted between 1876 and 1965 were intended to give African Americans a 'separate but equal' status, although in practice lead to conditions that were inferior to those enjoyed by white people.

"South Yorkshire Police has been accused of failing to act when a mother in Rotherham found the names of 125 potential sex abusers on her daughter's mobile phone, it has been reported. It has been alleged that the force told the mother that investigating the names would be a 'breach of her daughter's human rights'. The claims come from Professor Alexis Jay, the author of a damning report released this week into how 1,400 children in the South Yorkshire town were sexually abused at the hands of Asian men over 16 years, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . A mother has alleged that South Yorkshire Police, pictured, failed to act when she told them of 125 names of potential sex abusers on her daughter's mobile phone . Alexis Jay, the author of a report, which investigated child abuse in Rotherham and found that at least 1,400 children had been victims . In another case she claims it was also alleged that a CID officer suggested a 12-year-old, who had sex with five men was not a victim of abuse because it was 'consensual'. The claims come after the report by Professor Jay said the abuse went unreported for 16 years between 1997 and 2013, because staff feared they would be seen as racist. Yesterday South Yorkshire's chief constable spoke out about the report for the first time yesterday saying the findings made painful reading and vowed to 'fully investigate' the abuses. He said: 'The report into CSE (child sexual exploitation) in Rotherham laid bare the failings of South Yorkshire Police over a number of years. The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton, right, pictured with Shaun Right the PCC for South Yorkshire . 'This made for painful reading. However, I am determined that we will use the findings of the report to ensure the mistakes of the past are not repeated,' he added. It has also been claimed that former South Yorkshire Police chief Mike Hedges, was sent two letter giving a detailed account of abuse Rotherham. But Mr Hedges told the Times: 'Things were going on of which I was not aware... but I'm certain that the issue was never raised as something of high priority at all.' Meanwhile a former worker at a children's home in Rotherham has told how paedophiles would brazenly turn up to pick up girls as young as 11 who would escape from the building. A source, who has not been named, has now told the Daily Mirror how groomed girls in the home where he worked would escape from windows by tying their bed sheets together so they could meet up with the men. The child sexual exploitation team at Rotherham Council, pictured, won an award in March for tackling child sex exploitation . He said: 'If they [the girls] could leave by the fire escape, they would leave by the fire escape but sometimes, to hide where they were going, they would put bed sheets together and climb out of a window. 'Sometimes they would phone and they would pick up around the corner, but sometimes they would turn up and pick up at the children's home. 'It depended on how brazen they were or how much heat they thought was on at the time.' He also added that workers at the home were threatened by the men if they confronted them. It comes as it was also revealed that Rotherham Council's child sexual exploitation team won an award for tackling child sex exploitation in March, despite being at the centre of an abuse scandal. The national award was presented by the charity the NWG Network, who said they team were recognised for undergoing 'the longest journey under challenging conditions'. However, chief executive of the charity Sheila Taylor defended the decision to award Rotherham the honour and told the Sun it was for work done over the past year by current council staff. The spotlight first fell on Rotherham in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators', were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex. Ged Fitzgerald, the former chief executive of Rotherham Council, who is set to be questioned by his current employer Liverpool Council, over what he knew about the town's sex abuse scandal . The five men - Umar Razaq, Adil Hussain, Razwan Razaq, Zafran Ramzan, and Mohsin Khan - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances. The men, all British-born Pakistanis, attacked the four girls in play areas, parks and in the back of their cars, Sheffield Crown Court heard. Yesterday it was revealed that the former chief executive of Rotherham Council is to be questioned by his current employer over what he knew about the town's sex abuse scandal. Ged Fitzgerald, now head of Liverpool council, presided in Rotherham for a two-year period between 1997 and 2013. And during his tenure from 2001 to 2003, council figures allegedly wiped evidence of sexual abuse cases from computers as the Home Office compiled a report on the town. Mr Fitzgerald will become the first of the senior councillors in charge during the scandal to face interrogation. In a statement, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said he intended to raise his concerns about the report with Mr Fitzgerald. Earlier an Australian abuse victims' advocate called on Rotherham's former director of children's services to step down from her current job in that country. Andrew Collins said Dr Sonia Sharp's role as a deputy secretary in the state of Victoria's education department, which she has held since 2012, was inappropriate. She has been publicly backed by her employer. Dr Sharp, who worked in Rotherham from 2005 to 2008, apologised to abuse victims yesterday and said staff were aware that 'many' children were at risk. She said she wished she could have done more but insisted she had helped improve things during her tenure.","Force allegedly said investigating names would breach human rights .

"Baseball star Andruw Jones was arrested for allegedly battering his wife, to whom he drunkenly yelled 'I want to kill you' before dragging her down stairs during a heated domestic dispute. A police report released on Wednesday said Jones, 35, who played with the New York Yankees last season, became intoxicated after a Christmas Eve party at the couple's home. His wife, Nicole Derick Jones, told cops that her husband . had consumed several alcoholic beverages after the guests had left, and . she asked him to help put together a computer desk in the garage. Fight: Police say they were called to Andruw Jones' home in a wealthy suburb of Atlanta and found him fighting with his wife of ten years, Nicole Derick Jones . But as he worked on the desk, he became more and more belligerent, according to the police report, and they got into an argument that became 'pretty heated.' She said that Jones grabbed her arm, and dragged her across the floor of the garage until she slipped out of his grip and went back into the house. But Jones quickly followed and allegedly grabbed her ankle as she climbed up some stairs in the house, dragging her back down. According to his wife, he put his hands around her neck and said: 'I want to kill you, I want to f***ing kill you.' Mrs Jones eventually fled to her parent's home, where she called police, who responded to the home and found Jones asleep in the master bedroom. They said that he appeared dazed and visibly intoxicated. Cops said in their report that Nicole Jones suffered visible injuries on her neck as a result of the altercation. He was booked into Gwinnet County Jail at about 3:45am, and released about seven hours later on $2,400 bail. The couple has a son and daughter together.

Jones signed a $3.5 million, one-year contract with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Japan's Pacific League earlier this month. In 2001, he testified in the prostitution case against an Atlanta strip club owner. While Jones was never charged, he said that he was invited to the Gold Club and that he was propositioned for sex by two strippers. He testified under oath that he had sex with both the women in front of the club's owner and six other men.","Police report says he and wife Nicole got into heated argument after Christmas Eve party at their home .

"Manuel Pellegrini accepts success in the Champions League is key to keeping hold of star players such as Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero, but the Manchester City manager insists the English champions are not ‘obsessed’ with winning the competition. City are aiming to seal a place in the last eight for the first time but find their path blocked by a familiar foe in Barcelona, who they play in the last-16 on Tuesday. The Catalan club knocked Pellegrini’s team out at the same stage last season. City have won the Barclays Premier League twice in three seasons but Pellegrini concedes that to satisfy the desires of his stellar talent, progress in Europe must be made.

Yaya Toure in a powerhouse in the City midfield and would be key to the European glory they seek . ‘It’s important to grow in both competitions - in your league and be involved in the last stage of the Champions League. ‘It’s not an obsession to win the Champions League. We can do it but next year the target would be the same - to try to improve in every competition.’ Already eliminated from both domestic cup competitions, ending the season without a trophy is an unwelcome but realistic prospect for City. Their five-point deficit to Chelsea in the Premier League means their chances of retaining the title is out of their hands and, in Europe, they face a club that have reached at least the quarter-finals in every season since 2007. Pellegrini, however, says he does not feel his employment status hinges solely on delivering silverware. Pellegrini says he is not under pressure to deliver titles, dometic or European, after winning two trophies . Wilfried Bony made his debut in Saturday's win over Newcastle and could be a key figure for Pellegrini . Aguero netted against Newcastle early on and will be a threat to Barcelona, who lost on Saturday to Malaga . Edin Dzeko was City's man of the match on Saturday to put him in contention to face Barcelona on Tuesday . ‘I never feel pressure, just my own pressure to try to improve,’ he said. ‘We could win five titles in two years but that doesn’t mean for the next three years I could do what I want. ‘We can win the Champions League this year and next year there will be the same targets. ‘My own pressure is to improve, I’m not depending on winning one thing. That’s not the way I think.’ City had a player sent off in each leg as they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate last season by Gerardo Martino’s Barca.

The Sky Blues will hope he is not in the same form . This season, Luis Enrique is the coach against whom Pellegrini will pit his wits as he attempts to steer the nouveau riche English club into unchartered waters. Despite being relative newcomers to the competition, Pellegrini believes his players have no reason to feel inferior against the four-time winners, especially after beating German giants Bayern Munich in the group stages of the last two tournaments. ‘If we beat Bayern Munich, we can also beat Barcelona,’ Pellegrini said. ‘We did it last year and this year. It’s not a mental problem, it’s a strong team. ‘It’s very important not to make the mistakes that we made last year.’ Pellegrini said the defeat of Bayern Munich, led by Aguero's hat-trick, proves City can beat Barcelona .

"The operation was masterminded by accountant Paula White, an ex-director of Chester City . A former football club director set up a £3.6million operation that sold designer drugs online after they lost their status as ‘legal highs’ when they were banned, a court was told. The operation masterminded by accountant Paula White, an ex-director of Chester City, sold drugs with names such as Jolly Blue Pearls and Heaven via websites describing the products as being ‘like cocaine, ketamine or amphetamine’, a jury heard. Bolton Crown Court was told that White, 44, who was arrested at her £800,000 home in Salford after a surveillance operation, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class-B drugs between 2010 and 2013. Six other people yesterday denied being involved in the operation, which allegedly exported drugs from a mill near Bolton that they referred to as Area 51, after the top-secret US Air Force base in Nevada rumoured to house research on UFOs. Prosecutor Francis McEntee said it was ‘a sophisticated and highly profitable operation that has taken drug dealing off street corners and put it on the internet’, dispatching 200 parcels a day to users as far afield as Australia. He told the court that in April 2010, some of the drugs were made illegal but the group continued selling them. They were offered for ‘research’ but sold under categories such as ‘mood elevator’, meaning the group ‘knew the nature of what they were selling’. The trial continues. White will be sentenced later.

"Chef Adam Steele, 28, has been fired after he attacked a fellow chef at a party in the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace . One of the Queen's favourite chefs has been fired after allegedly headbutting another member of the Buckingham Palace staff during a drunken row. Adam Steele, 28, was popular with the Royal Family and was regularly requested by Prince Philip to cook for his guests. But he was sacked for the alleged assault on a fellow chef at a party in staff quarters at the Palace. Police were called when the fight broke out at the impromptu Friday night gathering in the Royal Mews, which was also attended by footmen, housemaids and other servants. Onlookers said the trouble erupted after Steele was told he had drunk too much and should quieten down. Officers arrested him and held him in cells overnight, while the other chef was left with a cut to his head and a black eye, according to Palace sources. Steele, an experienced sous-chef, had worked for the Queen for several years and was highly regarded. He had been due to travel with Prince Philip to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk this month to cook for guests at one of his regular shooting parties. But after the incident he was stripped of his Palace pass and dismissed following an internal inquiry by Mark Flanagan, the head of the royal kitchens. An insider told the Daily Mail: 'Mark wanted to keep him because the tragedy is Adam is a very good chef, and popular with the royals. He has cooked for the Queen at Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral and he is a particular favourite of the Duke of Edinburgh. 'Whenever the duke has his shooting parties at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate, he always asks for Adam.' The party in the Royal Mews, where many Palace staff have grace and favour homes, was on October 17. The precise details of the fight are unclear, but Steele is said to have headbutted the other chef and punched him in the face. Steele (right, wearing cap) and friends at Buckingham Palace during the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 . Police were called when the fight broke out at the impromptu Friday night gathering in the Royal Mews (pictured), which was also attended by footmen, housemaids and other servants . The insider said: 'No one knows what exactly was said to Adam, but it was something like, 'You've had enough, it's time to stop drinking'. 'Whatever it was, the next thing the other man has blood over his face and a cut eyebrow. It's ironic because they work together and we all thought they were friends.' The sacking meant that Steele could not cook for the state banquet at Buckingham Palace for Singapore's President Tony Tan Keng Yam a few days later. The Queen will be disappointed by the incident. She is believed to have met the young chef several times while performing her annual tradition of giving Christmas presents to her staff in person. Steele told the Daily Mail he was not allowed to comment. But his mother Gillian, 63, said news of her son's arrest and dismissal had been a shock. At her detached home in Alsager, Cheshire, Mrs Steele said: 'He has been at the Palace a number of years and I knew he was well-liked and popular so I can't understand how this has happened.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said Steele was charged with assault and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on November 4. He was bailed to appear again next Tuesday.

"Cop-out? A quarter of people admit to sending a text message telling their boss they are sick . More workers are ditching the traditional sickie telephone call and texting their bosses instead. A quarter of employees admitted to sending their boss a text message rather than explaining their ailments over the phone. And one in six people even resorted to sending a Facebook message instead of picking up the phone to their manager. But the survey of 10,000 people found almost three-quarters of bosses think that texting or emailing in sick is a cop-out. And 15 per cent of managers said an employee calling in sick because of  a cold would arouse suspicion that they are lying to get a day off. This mistrust has led suspicious bosses to play workers at their own game, taking to social media to check on their staff, with 20 per cent admitting to checking their sick employee’s Facebook page. Some managers admitted to calling their missing employees on a different phone number, with one in 20 even driving to their staff member’s house. Throwing a sickie: Even if people do call in sick the survey found 25 per cent ham up their symptoms . The research, by cough and cold medication Covonia, found that those who do call exaggerate their symptoms with a quarter of people straining their voice or pretending to cough. A third of people are also wary of using Facebook on a sick day, with 34 per cent saying they avoid using it to try not to raise their bosses’ suspicions. But expect no sympathy from your colleagues when you return to work as the research showed thirteen per cent of people would consider a co-worker to be weak if they took a sick day for a cold. Snooping: Some bosses admitted checking their absent employees Facebook to check if they were really ill . Director of the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University, Professor Ron Eccles, said: 'Colds are actually more difficult to contract than people believe and there is no evidence that going to work will increase the instances in the community. 'Cold sufferers are at their most contagious up to three days before exhibiting any symptoms, so by the time they are feeling unwell, the chance of catching their illness is already reduced. 'In fact, to catch a cold, close and prolonged contact to the virus is required which is why most colds are spread at home. 'If you do fall ill, by proactively treating symptoms with an appropriate remedy and washing hands regularly, there is really no reason the common cold should get in the way of day-to-day responsibilities.'","One in six say they have sent their boss a Facebook message explaining their ailments .

He had sailed across the Atlantic by his late teens, fished in Alaska and practiced martial arts and sword fighting. ‘He started ballet at age 16 or 17 and was an amazing dancer, a natural talent. ‘One of my dancers was a family friend of his and he was inspired by her dedication to ballet, so he came in to see what it was all about and it all started from there. ‘He had so much natural rhythm from his martial arts and sword fighting, he was made to dance.’ ‘Bowe was an expert at lifting his partners during routines,’ recalls Sherry. All the right moves:  Bowe was an expert in lifting his partners during routines, says Sherry. But she expects to welcome a very different man to the 'innocent' 20-something guy who she once shared an apartment with . Lift master: Sherry believes Bowe used ballet techniques to keep himself occupied and physically strong while he was alone and isolated in an unknown camp in Pakistan . Comic relief: Although he took his ballet seriously, his BFF Sherry describes Bowe as fun-loving . Sherry said Bowe put his natural ability to good use and appeared in a number of ballet productions including the Little Mermaid and Wizard of Oz while with the school. And, pointing to photos of Bowe on the ballet school wall, she says his dedication to dancing was such that he will have inevitably drawn on what he learned to help him get through his kidnap ordeal. Sherry believes Bowe would have ballet techniques to keep himself occupied and physically strong while he was alone and isolated in an unknown camp in Pakistan. ‘Ballet doesn’t deviate,’ says Sherry. ‘You do Plié and you do Tendus, and it’s very structured because it’s the same every time. ‘There’s been times in my life when the only thing that saved me was ballet class and hopefully he managed to find the same solace that I did. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised to find out Bowe practiced ballet while a hostage, it’s something you can do on your own. ‘The repetitiveness of it is reassuring and will have helped keep him fit. ‘If anyone can come through this and still be in one piece, still be together, it’s Bowe. ‘He had a strength of soul and mind, he is a strong person so there’s a really good chance he’ll come out the other end okay. ‘I hope he gets back into his dancing when he’s back.’ Bowe . was also home-schooled in a small mountain town in Idaho with a . population of about 8,000, had no TV at home and was raised by bookworm . parents Bob and Jani. His friends say he enlisted in the army to help the Afghan people and provide philanthropic support to the war effort. BFF: Sherry Horton was not only Bowe's teacher, she was his close friend and roommate. She still has a closet full of his stuff . Survivor: Sherry believes that If anyone could come through this and still be in one piece it's Bowe . ‘He was big on meditating and communing with nature and getting into himself,’ said Sherry. ‘That’s why I believe he would have been okay sitting by himself for a long time as a prisoner, he would have been happy in his own thoughts. ‘He just really was that kind of person who could focus on looking out for himself, soul searching.’ Sherry . said the loving family environment in which he was raised in quiet . Hailey meant Bowe maintained a level of ‘innocence’ before leaving to . join the military. And she has fond memories of their times together. ‘He was just a sweet guy, we were very close friends and I was his confidante,’ says Sherry. ‘We moved in together when he was about 18 and he lived with me until he left to go to the army when he was around 22. ‘I still consider him a roommate because I still have a closet full of his stuff.’ But Sherry says that after he was kidnapped it was hard to cope without Bowe around. ‘The past five years have been a blur,’ she said. ‘It was just so traumatic, seeing your roommate, your best friend being captured by the Taliban. I missed him so much. ‘It was tough, you always have it on your mind, you always know it is there.’ The worst part for Sherry was not knowing whether Bowe would come back dead or alive. Toughing it out: The POW would have practiced complicated Plié and Tendus dance moves to help him survive while held hostage by the Taliban. says his dance instructor . ‘We were getting the proof of life videos, but you never really knew for sure, that was the hardest part,’ she said. ‘All we could do was hope that what we were seeing was true and he was okay.’ But Sherry is realistic about what her best friend will be like once he returns to normality. She says she fully expects to welcome a very different man to the ‘fun-loving’ and ‘innocent’ 20-something guy who she once shared an apartment with. She says: ‘His innocence will be gone, it’s going to be a different Bowe for sure, but because of his strength and the strength of his family he will get back to a place where he can be at ease with himself, I’m sure of that.’ Bowe’s parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, believe the 28-year-old has a long road to recovery. He is currently resting and awaiting debriefing at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany and might not be home for weeks yet. Bowe was the only known missing U.S. soldier in the Afghan war after being captured under unknown . circumstances in eastern Afghanistan by militants on June 30, 2009 - . about two months after arriving in the country. After . years of negotiation he was finally freed in a deal that resulted in . five Taliban members held at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being . turned over to Qatar. When the news broke on Saturday morning it prompted wild celebration in Bowe’s hometown. Grin and bare it:  Bowe was shirtless (top left) for a 2006 performance of The Nutcracker are proudly displayed on the wall at the local YMCA in Ketchum - just a few miles north of his hometown of Hailey . Attitude: For his co-starring role in The Little Mermaid Bowe has a quiff of blonde hair . The streets and shop windows along Main Street in Hailey have been decked with yellow ribbons and balloons and banners reading ""Bowe is Free at Last!"" Sherry, a wide smile breaking across her face, said jubilantly: ‘It’s a huge weight off my shoulders and comes right in the middle of Spring. ‘Everything is new, the flowers are blooming, it is a perfect time for this to happen, life is good. ‘I just can’t wait to see him and give him a hug, there’s so much to catch up on. ‘I’m still dating the same guy from when he left.’ ‘Everyone in Hailey wants to celebrate and share stories, it is such a wonderful time in general, we are a close knit community and now we’re even closer.’","Sherry Horton was Bowe Bergdahl's ballet instructor, and his roommate.

"This defeat will hurt Louis van Gaal. History tells us that he doesn’t like conceding ground to Ronald Koeman. It will disturb Manchester United supporters even more, though, simply because it is indicative of changed circumstances. During the golden years, only the really big teams came to Old Trafford with victory in mind. Now, that invitation is open to any side who have the courage and nerve to take it.

This was the first time Southampton had beaten Manchester United at Old Trafford since a 2-0 victory in January 1988. Chris Nicholl was the Saints boss who put one over Alex Ferguson, thanks to two goals by Colin Clarke. It was United’s only home defeat that season but since then Southampton had lost 16 and drawn three. Koeman’s team didn’t win this match with a smash and grab. It was no backs-to-the-wall, hang-on-and-hope operation. Not a bit of it. Southampton came to Manchester looking to outplay United, while Saints’ manager came to prove himself tactically more astute than the compatriot with whom he once worked fractiously at Ajax. As the result suggests, both plans worked. The winning goal in the 69th minute, from Serbian substitute Dusan Tadic, surprised nobody, while United’s jumbled attacking formation failed to produce anything resembling a chance until Juan Mata missed a couple of opportunities late on. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster had to be vigilant but no more than that. He won’t be washing his gloves this week, so rarely did he have to use them. An interesting fact — the one that dominated social-media chat at full-time — was that United ended the game without registering a shot on target. That put Wayne Rooney’s suggestion that United had ‘deserved to win’ into its proper context and was indicative of the home team’s impotence in the final third of the field. Nathaniel Clyne posted this photo of the dressing room celebrations, writing: 'Fantastic result !!! it was a great performance from the lads. fans were great as usual #WeMarchOn #CleanSheet' Juan Mata (right) missed a number of good chances to level the scores shortly after Southampton went ahead against United .

Eljero Elia (right) of Southampton gets past Antonio Valencia (left) of Manchester United on his debut for Koeman's team . Rooney (centre) is closed down by Southampton captain  Fonte (right) and his defensive partner Florin Gardos (left) Perhaps equally as pertinent, though, was that this was a game that ended with no late cavalry charge from United. Here at Old Trafford, United teams used to view the possibility of victory for their opponents as an affront to their pride, as an insult even. Even on the days they did lose, they did so while threatening to kick the door down. Not on Sunday, though. Van Gaal made late substitutions and changed things round a bit. He pushed Rooney up the middle and threw on Marouane Fellaini to try to unsettle Southampton physically.United still ended the game quietly, though. Beaten in every way. Young striker James Wilson remained on the substitutes’ bench while Radamel Falcao — £280,000-a-week Radamel Falcao — watched from afar, having failed to make the squad. It was all a little odd, but then maybe not that odd at all. For this is the type of thing that always looks as though it may happen to United these days. The misery and defeatism of David Moyes’s time at United has disappeared but a vulnerability remains. Indeed, Van Gaal’s United have the same number of points that Moyes’s team did after the same number of games. Koeman was gracious afterwards but still struck a relevant theme when he mentioned the ‘difficulties’ of United’s three central defenders. He also stated that victory had not surprised him. ‘It is a good feeling,’ he said. ‘Certainly it’s better than how I felt when United beat us at Southampton.’ Nathaniel Clyne (right) gave an excellent display against United and kept Di Maria subdued throughout the game .

Alderweireld (right) was visibly upset at picking up an injury as he limped off the pitch at Old Trafford . Koeman gives instructions to his team during the victory against United . Defeat for United means Louis van Gaal's side drop below Southampton and go fourth in the Premier League table . 37 – Louis van Gaal has the same number of points as David Moyes after 21 Premier League games . 6 – Fraser Foster completed six more passes than Angel di Maria (13) 0 – the number of shots Manchester United had on target – the first time since May 2009 against Arsenal . 27 – The amount of years since Southampton last won at Old Trafford . That comment referred to United’s 2-1 win in Hampshire before Christmas. It was a victory United didn’t deserve and Southampton played as though they had vengeance in mind. Right back Nathaniel Clyne almost scored in the first minute – exchanging passes with Graziano Pelle and shooting across goal — and although that didn’t exactly set the tone, it highlighted a mindset that served Southampton well throughout. Van Gaal said rather tetchily later that Southampton had come for a draw and got lucky. That was quite wrong. Koeman’s plan was to stifle the flow of United possession that stems from Michael Carrick — he man-marked him with James Ward-Prowse — and then build from there. In the first half there were some half-chances for United but no more. They did enjoy territory but looked terribly one-paced. Angel di Maria drove one shot across goal and another wide from the edge of the penalty area. Robin van Persie, meanwhile, saw an effort blocked. The second half, though, was more telling. Rooney (right) fails to connect with a cross into the area as United chased an equalizer that never arrived . Gardos (centre) leaps up to head clear a cross in the final minutes of the game . Schneiderlin (right) caused United problems all day by breaking up a number of United's attacks . Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand (left) gets across to tackle Antonio Valencia in an impressive display on the left . The result means United have dropped into fourth place and are only a point higher than Arsenal . Once Southampton take the lead, they often hang on. Ronald Koeman’s side have only dropped two points from leading positions this season, the best in the PL. Southampton began brightly, and Steven Davis and Pelle were denied by interventions from Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw respectively. Pelle also headed wide from a corner before, with 21 minutes to go, United’s defence was breached. It was Tadic’s vision that did the damage. He seemed to have his head down amid a sea of red after United had failed to clear a long pass to the edge of their own area. But somehow the Southampton man spotted Pelle unmarked to his right and squeezed the ball out to his team-mate. One on one with David de Gea, Pelle should have scored, but even though his shot rebounded from the near post, Tadic was alert enough and calm enough to side-foot the ball back into the empty goal from 15 yards. There was still time for United and Mata could — maybe should — have scored late on. Twice Daley Blind provided the Spaniard with good chances but twice he failed to hit the target. Soon after, he missed again with a half volley. In many ways, Mata sums up the current United. Talented but unreliable, only sporadically impressive.","Southampton stifled Manchester United's attack in the first half and neither side managed a shot on target .

"From the moment the father of Bowe Bergdahl took the stage with President Barack Obama, it was clear the Bergdahls were not an average US military family. Sporting a long, bushy beard that he refused to trim since his son went missing in 2009, Bob Bergdahl spoke Pashto, Afghanistan's main language, and also a few words of Arabic at the White House press conference announcing his son's release. Some critics of the deal to free the only remaining American prisoner of war have shifted their attention to Mr Bergdahl and his controversial statements. Just a few days before his son was . released in a trade for five Guantanamo detainees, Mr Bergdalh tweeted . at a Taliban spokesman saying, 'I am still working to free all . Guantanamo prisoners.' 'God will repay for the death of every Afghan child, ameen.' Scroll down for video . Robert Bergdahl spoke Arabic and Pashto at the Rose Garden press conference with President Barack Obama announcing the release of his son Bowe . This tweet, which was later deleted, has drawn the ire of some conservative activists, who say it is evidence of possible 'Stockholm Syndrome' or a coverup . Before the beard: Bob Bergdahl poses with Country and Western star Ashley Monroe in the weeks after his son disappeared, left. He is also pictured right in a cowboy hat at a family reunion some years ago . The tweet was later deleted, but not before it was spotted by several conservative activists. Some are raising questions about Mr Bergdalh's loyalties - possibly even converting to Islam. He has become an active anti-war campaigner and spoken out against drone strikes and Gitmo. 'Folks, this is either a very bad case of Stockholm Syndrome or something far more nefarious is at stake,' wrote former Republican Congressman Allen West, who labeled the message a 'smoking gun.' 'Regardless, there is more to this than meets the eye of Obama making a unilateral decision and announcement on a Saturday - when he believes no one is watching.' Supporters see a man who has done everything he could raise awareness of his son's five years in enemy captivity and project any image that might be likely to keep Bowe alive. In a video posted by the Guardian, Mr Bergdahl told photographer Sean Smith: 'I don't work for the military. I don't work for the government. I don't represent the American people. I'm a father who wants his son back.' Mr Bergdahl's former pastor Bob Henley told the Washington Post that the father began to study radical Islamic politics as a way to understand his son's captors. He grew a beard to mark the time his son was gone - but also, possibly - to win some sympathy from the Taliban who held Bowe. Before Bowe was captures, Mr Bergdahl was best known as the town's UPS deliveryman. It all changed when Bowe was taken by the Taliban. Friends say he delved deeply into his studies of the country and the people who were holding his son. Some wondered aloud whether he had crossed a line, the Post reports. Bowe is seen here in April 2010 in Taliban captivity. This image was released by the soldier's captors during his five-year ordeal . Robert Bergdahl also got criticism for this tweet, in which he called democracy a 'cult' A spokesman for the family told the Washington Post that that Bergdahls acknowledged that the tweet about the deaths of Afghan children being avenged was sent and then deleted, but did not offer a further explanation. Some activists have picked up on other tweets from Mr Bergdahl, as well. In March, he wrote, '""Democracy"" is a cult in the West' in response to a comment about the Afghan elections. He also raised eyebrows when, in a pres conference, he said the family's hometown of Hailey, Idaho, 'We're so much like Afghanistan.' In a 2011 video message to Bowe's captors, Mr Bergdahl said: 'Strangely to some we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years. 'We know our son is a prisoner and at the same time a guest in your home.' Idyllic? This is the beautiful homestead of Bob and Jani Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho. The Bergdahls hope Bowe will return here to a hero's welcome. But what were the circumstances of his release? The Idaho-native Bergdahls were unlike many military families - or unlike many other families - well before Bowe was captures. The Bergdahls are Presbyterian. The Daily Telegraph reports that Bob and Jami are still  seen at church in town. They home-schooled Bowe for six hours a day. They also reportedly traveled 300 miles to attend an Orthodox Presbyterian church in Boise for a time. Bowe took ballet, but could also ride a horse and shoot a rifle by age 5. Mr Smith, the Guardian journalist who followed Bowe in Afghanistan before his capture and late spent time with his father, said Mr Bergdahl became political out of necessity after his son fell into Taliban hands. 'I don’t think he had all the opinions at the beginning that he had at the end. I think his thinking has changed,' he said. 'He was trying to understand. It’s not a question of agreeing with people. It’s a question, from his point of view, of trying to understand where they may be coming from.' In a Rolling Stone magazine article last year, Mr Bergdahl said he kept in contact with a Taliban source who claimed to know where his son was. He also said he had learned a great deal about Afghan politics. He learned to speak a few words of Pashto and Arabic so he could record a 2011 video message to his son's captors.","Bob Bergdahl has drawn scrutiny after speaking Pashto, an Afghan language, and Arabic at a Rose Garden press conference .

"Liam Ridgewell laughs as he relays one of the moments that has made his move to Portland Timbers an American dream. Enjoying a meal with friends in a restaurant near his new home, the player once of West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham and Aston Villa, was tapped on the shoulder by a fan of his current club. Dropping to his haunches then lying flat, arms outstretched, the supporter rolled along the floor unabashed as diners looked on bemused. Ridgewell, though, appreciated the gesture. Liam Ridgewell is loving life with the Portland Timbers after his summer move from West Bromwich Albion . Ridgewell's ‘Ridgeyroll’ goal celebration (above) has become famous across Oregon . The move is inspired by his brother’s Sunday League team who asked Ridgewell to showcase it during games . ‘The geezer’s rolled down the whole length of the bar,’ he recalls. ‘The manager, who knows us, had this towel and gets down on his knees to start cleaning up the floor. “What are you doing?” I ask. “He’s just fallen over,” he says. “No,” I explain. “He was doing the Ridgeyroll!”’ After half a season of Major League Soccer, Ridgewell is already famous in Oregon, and wider, for a goal celebration that has been named in his honour. Inspired by his brother’s Sunday League team, he first produced it after scoring a buccaneering solo effort at New England Revolution in August. There is more beside to give cause for his good mood as we chat over lunch in King’s Cross on his return to England now the MLS season has finished. He is fresh from five months spent living in a wood cabin by a lake, where he can drive out his boat and relax under the sun till his heart’s content. He has been playing in front of sell-out crowds boisterous from tailing-gating and discovering that Portland caters to his taste for bowler hats as well as PG Tips. He is getting into fantasy football US-style too. In London, there are meetings to be had over his swimwear company and ahead lies a first Christmas in 15 years celebrated with family and without football. Having sold his Birmingham house he is back, aged 30, with his parents at his childhood home, in Bexleyheath, Kent. ‘It’s lovely,’ he says. ‘You wake up in the morning and there’s a bacon sandwich and cup of tea ready. My brothers call it Hotel Ridgewell.’ That surname is used as less of a punchline when attached to his now trademark celebration – borne out of a transatlantic video-call with brother Clark as he enjoyed a London night out to toast the birth of his baby girl. Ridgewell (right) tangles with Didier Drogba during his time at Aston Villa during the 2006 season . Ridgewell (left), pictured holding off Portsmouth's Noe Pamarot, spent five seasons at Villa Park . Ridgwell watches on as Manchester United united striker Wayne Rooney winds up an audacious strike . ‘I was in the hotel before the New England game and he’s FaceTiming me while out on the p*** with his mates,’ says Ridgewell. ‘His whole Sunday League team do this log roll to celebrate goals. They’re all shouting, “Make sure you do the log roll when you score”. So I did.’ Curiously, one of Portland’s nicknames is Stumptown, owing to all the tress that needed to be chopped down in the 19th century to make way for a growing population. ‘It fits so well. Our mascot is called Timber Joey and when you score they cut a piece of log off and give it to you.’ Soon becoming the Ridgeyroll the move, which got another outing when he scored at home two weeks later, has taken off. He sees banners in the stands in tribute and fans send him clips of their own efforts. The goal that sparked it was something special. Winning the ball just inside his opponent’s half, Ridgewell dribbled past two players, beat a third for pace and planted a left-foot finish into the net. ‘I’m not the quickest in the world but I’ve gone past him like Gareth Bale,’ he says. ‘I scored one like it in a Stevie Bull testimonial for Aston Villa when I was 19. No one has seen it.’ Cameras caught this effort, preserved for eternity online. Ridgewell is living in America partly because of a summer birthday party in Las Vegas. It was there, on the first day, he received a call from his agent telling him Portland Timbers were interested. US geography was not Ridgewell’s forte. ‘Get a map,’ he was told. ‘It’s just 45 minutes north on a flight’ ‘That’s probably the main part of why I visited,’ admits Ridgewell. ‘They flew me out, picked me up, and drove me round. I was like, “Woah”.’ Ridgwell moved from Villa to Birmingham City in 2007 and spent five seasons with the Blues . Ridgewell, in action for Birmingham, tries to chase down Manchester City winger Adam Jonhson . He was amazed by the stadium, training ground, and infrastructure of the club. Then, when taken to Lake Oswego to sink a beer in scorching heat with manager Caleb Porter, he knew he had to take a leap made by few English players. ‘I was more or less sold there and then,’ he says. ‘I just needed for my kids to agree to it.’ Being nearly 5,000 miles away from Eva, who turned six in November, and Luca, turning nine on December 27, was a dilemma. A meal with them and his ex, led to a solution. ‘They saw it more as an adventure. Once they were fine, it was the easiest decision. My mum and dad brought them out for the whole of August. They really enjoyed it. It was hard walking through the terminal when they went back, standing there crying. But I’m out there playing football for them.’ Ridgewell insisted on a place by the lake he had fallen in love with. ‘My back garden has decking, some steps, and then there’s the lake,’ he says. ‘You can go swimming and people have trampolines where you dive in. ‘I bought a speedboat, so of an evening instead of getting a train or a bus you sail out to the local restaurant. No parties as such, we’ve had a couple of days out. You drop anchor, have a few drinks, sunbathe, muck about. ‘I want to go up into the woods, there are log cabins out in the middle of nowhere with infinity pools. I would never get that chance in England. While I’m out there I want to take it all in.’ West Bromwich Albion was Ridgewell's next port of call in 2012; he spent two seasons with the Baggies . Ridgewell (right) gets to grips with Norwich City's Nathan Redmond at the Hawthorns . The city is to his liking as well. ‘A bit quirky,’ says the man with tattoo sleeves on each arm and hair slicked back. ‘They have a nice hat store. I bought two bowler hats and three Oliver Twist flatcaps.’ Home comforts too. ‘I finally found and little English shop called Lady Di’s – after Diana. They have Ambrosia, Maryland Cookies, PG Tips, crumpets. Everything.’ Ridgewell has embraced American sport, doing well for a novice in the NFL’s version of fantasy football. ‘I held the draft at my house. You get the board up, stick the players in the air. By the time you get to the end the last two or three picks are anyone, you’ve had a drink. It’s a good laugh and a good way to bond with the players.’ Ridgewell is one of the club’s designated players, earning substantially more than most at $1.2million (£760,000) annually. Salaries are available for all to observe online. ‘You’re going in there as a designated player for a reason, so it’s a little bit more pressure on you,’ he says. ‘But as long as you’re down to earth, people respect you no matter what you’re earning.’ He thinks the MLS standard is roughly equivalent to high-end Championship, lower-end Premier League but predicts huge growth. ‘With more players, academy leagues and reserve leagues being set up, it will only get better.’ Packed stadiums point to a bright future. ‘Portland have a five year waiting list for season tickets. We have 26,000 fans all singing together. The Americans go to the game to entertain us, they don’t wait for us to entertain them. Ridgewell (Back row, fourth right) lines up for England U21’s clash with Holland at Pride Park in February 2005 . ‘They get in an hour-and-a-half before kick-off and are jumping and having a great time. They’ve done tail-gating beforehand; flip down their hood, get out their barbeque, cook some hotdogs, drink beer. ‘The atmosphere is like a Spurs v Arsenal game from back in the day. It’s crazy, you can’t hear yourself play. People camp out for three days just to get a ticket. You see them sleeping on the street.’ It is more serene for Ridgewell now, although there are meetings about his fledgling swimwear brand, Thomas Royall, alongside close friend Sam Saunders of Brentford. ‘It’s been going for eight months, there are 13 collections already. It’s something different.’ He is looking to go on loan to a club in London during the winter window, before the MLS season starts up again in March. But is open to just relaxing. All the while he will tell ex-teammates who ask that crossing the Atlantic is a chance not to be missed. ‘Since I’ve gone, a lot of people have asked, “What's it like?"" Once you know someone who’s gone and done it, people think, “I can do that.” I can definitely see more lads going out there.’","Liam Ridgewell had spells with Aston Villa, Birmingham and West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League .

"A backpacker who suffered from persistent nosebleeds was horrified to discover they were caused by a three-inch-long leech which had been living up her nose for a month. Daniela Liverani had been travelling around south-east Asia when she was involved in a motorbike crash. She had thought that a lump poking from the bottom of her nose was congealed blood from a burst blood vessel after the accident. But just days after returning home to Edinburgh she was disgusted to find that it was the head of a huge leech which had set up camp in her nostril. Scroll down for video . Daniela Liverani had been travelling around south-east Asia when she was involved in a motorbike crash. She was horrified to discover her nosebleeds were caused by a three-inch-long leech up her nose . After first trying to blow the leech out, and grab it with her fingers, the graduate, 24, was rushed to A&E to have the creature removed with forceps and tweezers. Miss Liverani, originally from Glasgow, said: 'Two weeks before I came home from Asia, I started having nosebleeds but I'd fallen off a motorbike so thought I'd burst a blood vessel. 'After I got home, the nosebleeds stopped and I started seeing something sticking out of my nostril. I just thought it was congealed blood from the nosebleeds. 'I tried to blow him out and grab him but I couldn't get a grip of him before he retreated back up my nose. Miss Liverani with the leech that lived up her nose. After first trying to blow the leech out, and grab it with her fingers, the graduate, 24, was rushed to A&E to have the huge creature removed with forceps and tweezers . 'When I was in the shower, he would come right out as far as my bottom lip and I could see him sticking out the bottom of my nose. 'So when that happened, I jumped out of the shower to look really closely in the mirror and I saw ridges on him. That's when I realised he was an animal. 'My friend Jenny and I called NHS 24 and were told to get to accident and emergency as soon as possible.' The graduate said: 'He had been curled up in a big ball, using my nostril as a little nest, so  I called him Mr Curly. At one point, I could feel him up at my eyebrow' She was whisked into a treatment room where a nurse and doctor examined her nose using a torch, forceps and tweezers. The doctor used a nose forceps to prise open her nostrils really wide while a nurse and her friend pinned her to the bed. Miss Liverani said: 'It was agony - whenever the doctor grabbed him, I could feel the leech tugging at the inside of my nose. 'Then all of a sudden, after half an hour, the pain stopped and the doctor had the leech in the tweezers. 'He was about as long as my forefinger and as fat as my thumb. Miss Liverani had been in Vietnam when it is believed that the leech made its way into her nose via water . 'He could move so fast as well, which freaked me out. I've no idea how he got up there but he'd have got bigger and bigger from feeding on my blood. 'He had been curled up in a big ball, using my nostril as a little nest, so Jenny and I called him Mr Curly. At one point, I could feel him up at my eyebrow. 'I asked the doctor what would've happened if I hadn't gone to hospital and she said he'd probably have worked his way into my brain.' Mark Siddal, curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an expert on leeches, said: 'Daniela could have picked up this leech from water in Vietnam, if she had been swimming. 'Or it could have gone in through her mouth, as she was drinking water. 'Even though it was there for around a month, these leeches don't grow all that quickly, so it wouldn't have been much smaller when it went up there. 'It would have been quite sizeable. 'It's interesting that people don't feel these leeches go up their nose.'","Daniela Liverani discovered head of a gigantic leech poking from her nose .

"Sen. John McCain on Thursday chided Western leaders while on foreign travel in the Ukraine for refusing to describe Russia's occupation of the country as an 'invasion.' 'If we in the West cannot say clearly that what [Russian President] Vladimir Putin is doing to Ukraine constitutes an invasion of a sovereign country . . .then we are living in Putin's world,' he remarked during a press conference in the country's capitol city, Kiev. 'Just as an invasion is an invasion, our world either has rules, or it does not,' he continued. McCain, a Republican, did not call out U.S. President Barack Obama by name in his statement but the Democratic president is among the world leaders who have shied away from using the term 'invasion' to characterize a deployment of 1,000 Russian troops to Ukraine last week. Scroll down for video . Sen. John McCain said at a press conference in Kiev, Ukraine today, that 'if we in the West cannot say clearly that what [Russian President] Vladimir Putin is doing to Ukraine constitutes an invasion of a sovereign country . . .then we are living in Putin's world' In a forceful speech delivered from Estonia, a former Soviet territory that now shares a border with Russia, President Obama told Baltic leaders on Wednesday that ‘borders can’t be redrawn at the barrel of a gun’ and the sovereignty of a country 'can't simply be taken away by brute force.’ 'We will not accept Russia’s occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea or any part of Ukraine,' he promised them. In a joint op-ed with British Prime Minister David Cameron that was published today in The Times of London Obama reiterated his dissatisfaction with Putin's actions. 'Russia . has ripped up the rulebook,' Obama and Cameron wrote. The U.S. and British leaders have declined to define the Russian deployment as an 'invasion' - even as a top Ukrainian military official warned that it was just that - preferring instead to call it an 'incursion.' Obama administration officials have said it shouldn't matter how they describe the situation in the Ukraine, though. 'Whatever it is called,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told CNN, 'it doesn't change the options that where -- the . United States is considering, in conjunction with Europe, in conjunction . with our counterparts around the world.' President Barack Obama, left, and British Prime Minister David Cameron, right, are in Wales this week meeting with other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Neither Obama nor Cameron have characterized Russia's deployment of 1,000 troops into Ukraine as an 'invasion' Sen. McCain traveled to Ukraine this week for the fourth time in the past year as President Obama and European heads of state met in Wales to discuss the crisis in Ukraine during a a two-day gathering of members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. McCain, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in his statement he came back to besieged country 'because I believe what is happening in Ukraine is about far more than Ukraine.' 'It is about the principles of international order that have brought peace and hope to Europe, and much of the world beyond Europe, since 1945,' he said, 'and whether a world based on these principles will endure or not.' The Arizona lawmaker said that if Putin can invade a country 'for no reason other than greed, belligerence, and imperial ambition, what is to stop others from doing so?' 'If that principle does not apply in Ukraine, why should it apply anywhere else?' he added. McCain argued that Putin wouldn't have violated international norms if he didn't think he could get away with it. 'The real provocation for Putin has been the perception of Western weakness,' he said. Scroll down for more . 'What should be clear is that Putin's appetite only grows with the eating, and he will keep taking more until he faces a consequence he is unwilling to incur. Clearly we have not reached that point, and it is urgent that we do.' The elder statesman had already called on the White House on Sunday to provide weapons and intelligence to Ukraine so it can defend itself and he reiterated his support for military assistance today. He also claimed the U.S. needs to place 'truly crushing sanctions' on Russia if it wants to shut down Putin's offensive. 'The horrors of the last century unfolded because good people too often failed to recognize what was at stake for them in the suffering of others,' the five-term Senator and former prisoner of war cautioned. 'If Europeans and Americans and the civilized world do not recall that lesson now, and do more to help Ukraine in its hour of greatest need, the darkness in our world will only grow.' McCain is also the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senate Foreign Relations Chair Robert Mendez, a Democrat, has been lobbying the Obama administration to provide more substantial assistance to Ukraine as well. 'We should provide the Ukrainians with the type of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon Putin for further aggression,' he said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union news program.","McCain did not call President Obama out by name, but Obama is one of the world leaders refusing to describe the deployment as an 'invasion'

The Republican lawmaker said that if the West didn't stop Putin, the leaders of other countries emboldened to invade sovereign territories ."
"Minecraft founder Markus Persson has sold his hugely popular game to Microsoft. The announcement was made on Microsoft's official Xbox blog, and reports claim the software giant paid $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion) for Persson's company Mojang, which includes rights to the game.

'Today is an . incredibly exciting day for our team as Mojang and the Minecraft . franchise join Microsoft,' explained Phil Spencer, head of Xbox. 'Our relationship with Mojang began when we initially talked to the team about bringing Minecraft to the console. 'Minecraft . quickly became the top online game on Xbox Live, with over two billion . hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years. 'That working relationship set the ground work for other opportunities. We’ve long seen the incredible potential of Minecraft.' Markus Persson (pictured) created Minecraft in 2009 before releasing it widely in November 2011 . 'We’re . excited to welcome Mojang to the Microsoft family and we are thrilled . to support the success and longevity of Minecraft for years to come.' Mr . Spencer added that Minecon - the annual Minecraft convention - will . continue next year, and the firm will have 'much more to share in the . coming months.' The . deal exceeds the amount Facebook paid . for virtual reality headset firm which creates Oculus Rift. In a statement released following the acquisition, Persson said: 'I'm leaving Mojang. 'A relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. 'Jens [Bergensten] was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things. 'I was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration. 'I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter. 'As soon as this deal is finalised, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. 'Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them. 'I’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that. 'I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big. 'In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change. 'It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.' Following the news, Twitter user @aaronmblevin wrote: 'If Minecraft can teach us anything today, it's that the interests of capital always come before the interests of the collective.'

More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon. There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs. Aside from the revenue that Mojang will generate for Microsoft, experts believe the firm will use it to push existing services on new customers. Piers Harding-Rolls, director, Head of Games at  IHS Technology told MailOnline: 'Microsoft's move to buy Minecraft developer and owner Mojang may come as a surprise to the game's more fervent fans, but it is rooted in commercial, if not cultural, sense. In 2012, founder Markus Persson, who tweets under the handle @notch, openly criticised Microsoft's Windows 8 software (pictured). He also said 'Got an email from Microsoft, wanting to help 'certify' Minecraft for Windows 8.

'The news . robustly dismisses the idea that games are no longer at the core of . Microsoft's strategic direction and also underlines the growing . importance of independent titles alongside big-budget games. 'Minecraft is arguably the best-positioned independently-owned IP across the games sector today. 'While . it has already generated over 54 million games sales and revenues . approaching $500m, Minecraft is a franchise built to last, making the . likely heavy investment required to secure Mojang significantly less . risky than many other recent acquisitions within the games or app . sectors.' Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business for $7.3 billion in April and is also seeking to boost Microsoft's Windows Phone system, which has gained little traction against Apple's iPhones and Google's Android system. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses - Windows and Office software installed on desktops - slow down or decline. 'We believe the acquisition of the ubiquitous Minecraft game strategically makes sense as Microsoft looks for ways to drive users toward its nascent mobile hardware business, where it can leverage and cross-sell a wide range of its higher-margin software, such as Office 365 and Windows,' FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives added. Professor of Practice Mark Skilton told MailOnline: 'This move is a reflection of the 'platforming' strategy that Satya Nadella and others recognise as critical to building a strong customer base. 'Microsoft started Xbox as a separate . area but this move for Mojang demonstrates it's still very much a core . platform for user traffic generation. 'The . online gaming industry is fast moving from niche collective enthusiast . to mass market and Minecraft is a logical move as big business follows . the traffic numbers in the digital world. 'Minecraft . made more than $100 million last year and has over 100 million . registered users with 14.3 million copies of the software game on the . PC. 'It is another case of a blockbuster software investment to drive the gaming platform industry.' Since last . November, Minecraft has become one of publishing's most successful . franchises with a series of compact, illustrated books, too. This . includes three guides - Minecraft: Essential Handbook, Minecraft: .

"McDonald's has shed light on its food production techniques after answering some of the more uncomfortable 'frequently asked questions' the company faces about its ingredients and processing methods. The fast food giant has provided answers on its U.S. website to a range of queries concerning the quality and content of its food, including whether 'pink slime' was used in its burgers. The company, which has often been criticised for its food sourcing and processing methods, has also addressed such issues as whether its McRib is made using the same plastics as yoga mats and what the ingredients are in Chicken McNuggets. Scroll down for videos . Fast food giant McDonald's has answered a number of questions about its food production techniques on its U.S. website . The company has answered such questions as whether 'pink slime' was used in its burgers . In response to whether its burgers were made using 'real beef', McDonald's said in the U.S. they were made of '100% USDA-inspected beef.' It goes on to say: 'There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called ""pink-slime"" in our beef. 'The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling.' In response to a direct question of whether it uses 'pink-slime' in its burgers, McDonald's USA says: 'Lean finely textured beef treated with ammonia, what some individuals call “pink slime"" or select lean beef trimmings, is not used in our burgers. Any recent reports that it is are false.' However, it goes on to say: 'McDonald’s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011. 'While select lean beef trimmings are safe, we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world.' The restaurant chain has also answered questions about the ingredients used in its Chicken McNuggets, and why they include an 'anti-foaming' agent . The company has also addressed whether its McRib is made using the same plastics as yoga mats . Elsewhere, the company attempts to explain the difference between the azodicarbonamide used in yoga mats and the variation of the chemical compound which is found in its McRib. It says while the ingredient can be found in bread and other items including hot dogs and hamburger buns, a 'variation of this ingredient' is also used in some non-food products, including yoga mats. It goes on to say it is 'simply not true' however to claim McDonald's food 'contains that same rubber or plastics'. The company says: 'We recognize the difference between using ingredients in food versus using a variation of those ingredients for non-food purposes can be confusing. 'We also realize that sometimes the scientific name for an ingredient may sound scary. For example, the salt you use to de-ice a driveway is a variation of the salt you use in the kitchen, however they are both sodium chloride.' Q: ARE YOUR HAMBURGERS MADE USING REAL BEEF? MCDONALD'S: Yes. Our burgers in the US are made using only 100% USDA-inspected beef. There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called “pink slime” in our beef. The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling. You can learn more about the ingredients in our food here. Q: DO YOU USE SO-CALLED 'PINK SLIME' IN YOUR BURGERS? MCDONALD'S: Lean finely textured beef treated with ammonia, what some individuals call 'pink slime' or select lean beef trimmings, is not used in our burgers. Any recent reports that it is are false. McDonald’s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011.

In response to whether its burgers were made using 'real beef', McDonalds said in the U.S. they were made of '100% USDA-inspected beef' Q: DO YOU IMPORT BEEF FROM BRAZIL, FROM CLEAR-CUT RAINFORESTS? DO YOU IMPORT CHICKEN FROM CHINA? MCDONALD'S: Most of our beef we use in our U.S. restaurants comes from the U.S, although we import a small percentage of our 100% beef from suppliers in Australia and New Zealand to supplement our U.S. purchases. These suppliers must also meet McDonald’s quality and safety standards and USDA regulations. In fact, we’ve maintained a global policy against using beef sourced from de-forested rainforests since 1989. You can learn more about our long history of sustainable land management practices here. All of the chicken we use in our U.S. restaurants is born and raised in the U.S. and comes from our trusted USDA-inspected American suppliers. Q: WHY DO YOUR CHICKEN MCNUGGETS INCLUDE AN 'ANTI-FOAMING' AGENT? MCDONALD'S: McDonald’s frying oil contains a small amount of an additive called dimethlypolysiloxane, which helps prevent oil from foaming and spattering in our restaurants. All of the ingredients we use, including dimethylpolysiloxane, meet recognized food quality and safety standards.  Because dimethylpolysiloxane is used in some non-food products, like putty, caulks  or cosmetics, there have been individuals who have erroneously claimed that these items are also in our food. We recognize the difference between using ingredients in food versus using a variation of those ingredients for non-food purposes can be confusing. We also realize that sometimes the scientific name for an ingredient may sound scary. For example, the salt you use to de-ice a driveway is a variation of the salt you use in the kitchen, however they are both sodium chloride. You can learn more about the ingredients in our food here. McDonald's answered the question of whether its McRib was 'made using the same plastics as yoga mats' Q: IS THE MCRIB MADE USING THE SAME PLASTICS AS YOGA MATS? MCDONALD'S: We use ingredients that are commonly used by the food industry and meet recognized food quality and safety standards. Azodicarbonamide is used by bakers to help ensure a consistent texture in each batch of bread they bake. It is used in many items on grocery store shelves, like some hot dog and hamburger buns and other bread products you may already purchase. Because a variation of this ingredient is used in some non-food products, including yoga mats, there have been individuals who have erroneously claimed that our food contains that same rubber or plastics.

"Canadian security forces have thwarted an al-Qaeda-backed terrorist plot to derail a New York City-bound passenger train as it crossed the Niagara River, just a few miles from Niagara Falls. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police yesterday arrested Chiheb Esseghaier, 30, of Montreal, and Raed Jaser, 35, of Toronto. Authorities allege the pair took orders and received guidance from al-Qaeda operatives in Iran. Officials reportedly watched the men for more than a year and say the plot never got past the planning stages. Canadian counter-terrorism investigators say the public was never in danger, the the men would have carried out the attack if they had not been stopped. Police were later seen raiding Jaser's house in northern Toronto, carrying away material which could be used as evidence in the suspects' prosecution. Scroll down for video . Raid: Police were pictured at a house in Toronto yesterday in connection with a plot to blow up a train . Operation: The alleged would-be terrorists were under surveillance from Canadian police for over a year . Evidence: Offers were pictured carrying away material from the home in the north of the city . Neither of the men are Canadian . citizens, but security officials would not reveal where they were from . or why they were in the country. The alleged plot is not believed to have any link with last week's Boston Marathon bombings. The two men allegedly planned to derail an Amtrak or Canadian Via train . as it crossed over the Whirpool Rapids Bridge from Canada into the . United States, according to reports. The 115-year-old arch bridge spans the Niagara River 225 feet above the water. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said the operations was conducted . with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. Thwarted: The raid came in the wake of the arrest of two foreigners living in Canada with alleged Al Qaeda links . Link: The house belongs to Raed Jaser, 32, one of the two men arrested on Monday . Carried away: Some of the material removed from the home by police as part of their investigation . A source told Reuters that the Amtrak Maple Leaf line, which runs from Toronto to New York City, was targeted. Canadian officials declined to confirm which trains were in the crosshairs. The men allegedly watched trains and rail yards across the greater Toronto area to prepare for their assault. 'Today's arrests demonstrate that terrorism continues to be a real threat to Canada,' Public Safety Minister Vic Toews told reporters in Ottawa. 'Canada will not tolerate terrorist activity and we will not be used as a safe haven for terrorists or those who support terrorist activities.' Thwarted: The suspects were allegedly planning to derail a passenger train as it cross the Niagara River on the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge (pictured) Targeted: Authorities say two accused terrorists conducted surveillance on Via Rail trains, Canada's national passenger rail service, with the intention of derailing one of the trains . Perhaps the biggest surprise to come out of the announcement is that the orders were given by al-Qaeda leaders in Iran. Iran, a Shi'a-majority country, is a strange ally for the fiercely Sunni Muslim terrorist group. CNN reported last month that the few surviving members of Osama bin Laden's inner circle currently reside in Iran. Some of bin Laden's family are said to . be under house arrest in Tehran. Others - including top advisers - live . in the ski resort city of Chalus on the Caspian Sea. International terrorism: The suspects, who were based in Canada's two largest cities, planned to target trains between New York and Toronto . Canadian authorities, though, were careful to make clear that this was not an instance of state-sponsored terrorism. 'This is an example of the United States and Canada working together to protect our citizens,' said David Jacobson, the American ambassador to Canada. 'It underscores the fact that we face serious and real threats, and that security is a shared responsibility. We all need to remain vigilant in confronting threats and keeping North America safe and secure.' Another instance of American-Canadian co-operation that has made headlines of late was the joint effort to extract U.S. embassy workers from Iran during the hostage crisis of 1979. Similarities: Today's arrests were the latest in a history of co-operation between American and Canadian authorities, another instance of which was the inspiration for the hit movie Argo (pictured) Announcement: Authorities gave few details about the plot, but said the public was never in danger . In that instance, six Americans hid out in the Canadian embassy in Tehran for 79 days. Another similarity between the international episodes is that the two terrorists arrested in Canada today were reportedly tied to al Qaeda operatives based in Iran. The arrests follow not only the Boston bombings but revelations that Canadians took part in an attack by militants on a gas plant in Algeria in January. It also recalls the arrests in 2006 of a group of more than a dozen Toronto-area men accused of planning to plant bombs at various Canadian targets. Eleven men were eventually convicted of taking part on the plot.","Chiheb Esseghaier, 30, and Raed Jaser, 35, were arrested yesterday .

"Petrol and diesel could be replaced by a fuel developed from a bacteria found in the human gut, scientists claim. Researchers have found a way to use the gut bacteria E.coli - often behind attacks of diarrhoea - to help generate propane gas - a part of petroleum gas. The results could one day lead to a new type of fuel that uses solar energy to convert it into a useable form. Scientists have found a way to use the gut bacteria E.coli (pictured) - often behind attacks of diarrhoea - to help generate propane gas - a part of petroleum gas used in everything from cars to camping stoves . Researchers added three enzymes to the bacteria, thioesterase, CAR and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase. This allowed them to extract butyric acid, a foul smelling compound essential for propane production. Dr Patrick Jones, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London, said: 'Although this research is at a very early stage, our proof of concept study provides a method for renewable production of a fuel that previously was only accessible from fossil reserves. 'Although we have only produced tiny amounts so far, the fuel we have produced is ready to be used in an engine straight away. The results, published in the journal Nature Communications, could one day lead to a new type of fuel for cars that uses solar energy to convert it into a useable form . 'This opens up possibilities for future sustainable production of renewable fuels that at first could complement, and thereafter replace fossil fuels like diesel, petrol, natural gas and jet fuel.' The notion that homes could be fuelled by human waste, might not be an appealing, but it could transform people's lives in developing countries. British scientists have already proved they can charge a phone by using urine to feed microbial fuel cells. And they aim to scale up their innovation to provide much needed electricity and sanitation in the form of a clever bathroom system designed to be used in remote and poor areas of the world. The research is backed by the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation, as the Microsoft billionaire is keen to help to create a fully-functional system that could be installed in bathrooms to collect urine, which would be used to light and heat a house as well as power gadgets. 'Fossil fuels are a finite resource and as our population continues to grow we are going to have to come up with new ways to meet increasing energy demands.

'At the moment, we don't have a full grasp of exactly how the fuel molecules are made, so we are now trying to find out exactly how this process unfolds.

"Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid may rule La Liga, but cast your eyes away from the glitz, glamour and silverware and head north to the Basque Country. There's a new Spanish fairytale in SD Eibar. On Sunday, the minnows will play their first ever Spanish top flight game against Real Sociedad in front of a few thousand fans at their Ipurua Stadium home. With this, they become the smallest ever team to play in the top division. With a capacity of 5,250 - less than 18 of the current Vanarama Conference grounds - it will be a cramped, rowdy but overall celebratory affair. That's because Eibar's place in La Liga was nearly taken away from them. Historic moment: Spanish minnows SD Eibar will play in La Liga for the first-time ever in their history . Winning smiles:  Eibar players celebrate gaining promotion in May from Segunda . World's best: Eibar will face the talents of Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) next season . Aptly nicknamed 'the Gunners', Eibar bear some resemblance to their North London namesakes Arsenal. They are well run, self-sustainable and put on a fantastic show for supporters. But after gaining promotion in May by finishing two points ahead of Deportivo La Coruna, Eibar were immediately threatened with a double relegation to Segunda B, Spain’s third tier. The Spanish FA demanded Eibar should raise over 1.7million euros by August 6, because the club were required to hold a share capital of at least 2.1million euros. Controversial: Despite gaining promotion to La Liga,  Eibar were threatened with a double relegation . Ridiculous: The Spanish FA demanded Eibar should raise over 1.7million euros by August 6 to play in La Liga . The demands of the Spanish FA were strict; seen by some as a way of keeping little old Eibar down in the lower leagues. That may be a conspiracy theory, but fans were right to point to the debt hanging over bigger teams in La Liga. They asked how could a club with absolutely no debt be denied entry to the top flight and threatened with a double relegation? A campaign, Defiende al Eibar – Defend Eibar – was created by the club and supported by former loan players David Silva and Xabi Alonso, who echoed these concerns. Standing strong: Eibar's campaign to keep them in La Liga worked with the club raising the required funds . Alonso said in May: ‘It is contradictory that a club who has an enviable financial health and with zero debts is obliged to do this, when there are others who have much deeper problems. ‘I hope we can put in a big push to keep when where they deserve to be.’ Chairman Alex Aranzabal was also perplexed by the ruling, with this example warranting a deeper look at the financial requirements policy for newly-promoted clubs. Up for it: Former Eibar player Xabi Alonso has supported the club's efforts to play in La Liga this season . Blast from the past: Spain international David Silva (left) also featured for Eibar in a loan spell from Valencia . He told CNN at the time: 'Even though we have a small budget, we have a different economic model to other clubs in Spain. We have less expenses, fewer outgoings and we always have a small deficit. 'This is something really strange in Spain because almost every team has huge debt, but in our case we have no debt. 'We think it is really unfair because the law was established to assure that all those clubs with a lot of debt had a minimum capital value to attend to all their debts.' The campaign worked, and by selling shares for a minimum of 50 euros and maximum of 100,000 euros, the club raised the cash by mid-July; a stiff two fingers up to the Spanish FA. Over 8,000 people from 48 countries now own part of the club, from UK football fans to Americans and Chinese with a new team to look out for. Worldwide support: Over 8,000 people from 48 countries now own part of the Spanish minnows . Close ties: Eibar's blue and red strip originated from Barcelona's kit . Alonso, from Real Sociedad in 2001, and Silva, from Valencia in 2005 were sent to Eibar to 'toughen them up', and the club's philosophy remains strong. Nevermind Stoke on a wet, Tuesday night. Lionel Messi and Co will be given a stern, honest test from Gaizka Garitano’s men in March, and Barcelona will at least be able to relate to the newcomers on one level. Eibar's blue and red strip originated from a Barcelona kit, handed to them four years after they were founded in 1940 because they were short. Those who handed the strips to Eibar would struggle to believe that 70 years later the two would clash in the top flight. The two sides are still polar opposites in wealth and stature. In fact, Eibar are miles from any La Liga side in size. Petit: Eibar's Ipurua Municipal Stadium currently holds a capacity of 5,250 . The tiny Basque city, with a population of 27,000, would fit into the Nou Camp nearly four times; the city of Madrid 119 times. The only city in Spain with a La Liga team that comes close to the size of Eibar is Villarreal, with nearly double the number of habitants. The total number of fans that watched Eibar in the Segunda Division last season – 63,000 – would fit in Old Trafford with plenty of empty seats for the TV cameras to scan over. This gives you some idea of the task chairman Aranzabal and manager Garitano face throughout the 38-game season, but Eibar have recruited midfielder Derek Boateng in the last week to strengthen a side depleted by returning loan players. All smiles: Eibar have signed Derek Boateng (centre) to help them strengthen their La Liga debut campaign . Jota Peleteiro, who clocked up 11 goals last season from midfield, signed a three-year deal with Brentford this summer from parent club Celta Vigo, but striker Federico Piovaccari has arrived from Sampdoria. Other than Boateng and Piovaccari, the team is currently completely Spanish. The next challenge is for the club to upgrade their stadium. Under La Liga rules, clubs have to increase their capacity to 15,000 in two years, and for now Eibar are building a new stand to increase the Ipurua Municipal Stadium to 6,700. They would welcome being forced into making another upgrade next summer; it would mean they have survived in La Liga.

Having a chat: Cleverley has met with Villa assistant Roy Keane (right, next to manager Paul Lambert) Keane knows all about leaving Manchester following his controversial departure midway through the 2004-05 season, but Cleverley is still to decide where his future lies. The preferred option for the midfielder is to head out on loan for the remainder of the season and then leave Louis van Gaal's side on a free next summer. Running down his contract and being able to move on a free would present the midfielder with the greatest array of options to move on after becoming a peripheral figure under the new manager.

"Mark Noble will give serious consideration to representing the Republic of Ireland at international level after being overlooked by England manager Roy Hodgson. It has emerged that the West Ham United midfielder qualifies for Ireland by virtue of his paternal grandparents and has been pursued by manager Martin O’Neill since he took over last November. Assistant Roy Keane is believed to have scouted Noble, 27, and O’Neill wants to bring him into the Irish set-up to add quality to his midfield options for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's exclusive interview with West Ham's Mark Noble . Making the move: Mark Noble is ready to commit his international future to Ireland . Coup: Noble has played an important role for West Ham over the last few seasons . Noble was named West Ham’s player of the year last season and it had been expected he might be included in Hodgson’s latest squad for the friendly with Norway and qualifier against Switzerland. He was on the England radar but instead Jack Colback and Fabian Delph got the nod, leaving Noble thinking about accepting O’Neill’s offer. A passport would need to be sorted but that hurdle is not envisaged to present any problems. Noble, born in Canning Town, London, represented England at youth levels and captained the Under-21 side that made the final of the 2009 European Championships. Switching sides: Noble won 20 caps for England U21s - but looks set to play for Ireland . Decision time: Noble played for the England U21 with Gabriel Agbonlahor, Adam Johnson and James Milner . Getting his man: Martin O'Neill hopes convince Noble to play for Ireland . That 4-0 defeat five years ago to a Germany side that included six future World Cup winners was Noble’s last in an England shirt. In all he won 20 caps, scoring three goals for the Under-21s. Since then he has established himself as one of West Ham’s most important players and is this year celebrating a decade of first-team football at Upton Park. He has scored 33 goals in 287 appearances for the club. Noble, who attracted interest from Sunderland and Newcastle this summer, was thought to have been looked at by O’Neill’s predecessor Giovanni Trapattoni and would provide a strong partner for James McCarthy in central midfield were he pledge allegiance to Ireland.

"A builder dumped twice by an African bride who used him to get a UK visa has denied being Britain’s most gullible groom as he prepared to marry a second Kenyan beauty. Tim Reeves, 58, was dumped by Priscila Njenga the day after she got her hands on a spouse’s visa following their wedding. Amazingly, when she turned up at his door begging for help getting her daughter into Britain - heartbroken Tim took her back. But the day after he secured her daughter’s visa Njenga left him for the second time and has never returned. Déjà vu: Tim Reeves, 58, with his ex-wife Priscila Njoki Njenga on their wedding day in Kenya in October 2008, right, and, left, with new fiancee Maryanne Wanja, 26, who he met on an African dating website . The cheated brickie later learned she was already married and had lied about her age - telling him she was 34 when she was 40. Mr Reeves, from  Slough, Berkshire, now suspects the whole wedding was a scam and that many of the guests were actors brought in to dupe him. But despite his experience, Mr Reeves is now engaged to Kenyan Maryanne Wanja, 26, who he has known for four months after they met on an African dating website. He is so besotted he has already moved his lover out of the slum she was living in to a luxury flat in Kenya. Happy: Mr Reeves is so besotted with Miss Wanja he has already moved her out of the slum she was living in to a luxury flat in Kenya . Mr Reeves is also paying for all of her food and clothes and school fees for her daughter’s private education. His worried family believe he is falling for exactly the same trick again and are panicking about him switching continents to be with her. But the love-blind Romeo denied being gullible and declared: 'This time it’s love.' He said: 'I can’t wait to marry Maryanne. We spend hours a day talking and miss each other so much. She’s the woman of my dreams and is perfect for me. 'I know people might think I’m being taken for a ride, especially after my last experience, but Maryanne is completely different to Priscila and I know this is the real deal.' He added: 'When Priscila left me I felt completely betrayed. She lied about everything - even telling me she was 34 when she was actually 40. Awkward: When first wife Priscila Njenga, left, walked out on Mr Reeves the builder found out she was already married and had lied about her age, telling him she was 34 when she was 40 . 'I was stupid to take her back, but I felt sorry for her daughter. It is very hard to refuse to help when you are hearing horrific stories about what is happening to a young girl. 'I can see now that she only wanted her daughter in the UK so the authorities could not throw her out if Helen was in full-time education. She planned everything. 'The difference is I spent every day with Maryanne for seven weeks and I know her much better. I have met her friends - I only met one of Priscila’s friends. 'Maryanne is not a risk as she has no desire to move to the UK. She just wants me to stay in Kenya with her. 'I’ve fallen out with my mum and my close friends about emigrating - it’s hard as they don’t want me to get hurt again. Second time lucky? Mr Reeves then fell foul of Njenga again when she begged him to take her back so her daughter Helen could get a visa. He did and then she left . 'But this is my future happiness.' Mr Reeves met Njenga in 2008 after his Kenyan friend Moses Mbarue showed him a picture of her and revealed she wanted an English man. After a brief phone chat Mr Reeves flew out to see Njenga and felt a 'connection' - even though she didn’t speak English. He proposed to her on a restaurant balcony on his fourth day in Kenya on May 16, 2008. He shelled out £5,000 on the ceremony in Kenya on October 25, 2008 and bought Njenga a six-month visiting visa so they could fly back to England in November. The couple then went back to Kenya on April 13, 2009, after Mr Reeves had raised the money for a spouse's visa. I've done it: Njenga, pictured with  her daughter Helen, makes a quick call possibly to Mr Reeves's friend Moses Mbarue who the builder believes she was already married to . Sham: Njenga put that she was a 'business woman' on the couple's marriage certificate . He came back to the UK on May 13, and Njenga arrived back on May 30, but by August 6 she had disappeared. But forgiving Mr Reeves rekindled their romance when Njenga turned up at his house in May 2010 begging him to help bring her 18-year-old daughter, Helen, over to the UK. But after Mr Reeves helped Helen gain temporary access to the UK, in August, Njenga and her daughter disappeared and have not been seen since. Still in search of true love Mr Reeves met his new African fiancee Maryanne on dating website Afro Introductions and flew out to spend seven weeks with her in December 2011. Devoted Mr Reeves moved Maryanne out of a shack in a dangerous slum and she now lives in his flat at a cost of £140 a month. He also says he pays £25 a week for food and bills as well as the school fees for Maryanne’s daughter. Sure thing: Mr Reeves said he has fallen out with his family over his upcoming nuptials to Miss Wanja and his intention to immigrate to Kenya to be with her . He proposed on Christmas Day and he is moving to Kenya to live with her and set up a charity and a security business. Mr Reeves said: 'Maryanne and I have lead completely different lives, but we have a deep understanding of each other. 'We talk about everything that has happened to me and her life as an orphan - our hardships bring us together. 'She loves me so much and we message each other at least 20 times a day on Facebook. Sometimes I wish I had never got involved in all this, but then I would not have met Maryanne. 'I am finally living a real-life love story.' Mr Reeves now believes Njenga was already married to his best friend and house mate Moses Mbarue - who introduced them. He claimed she was living with a 70-year-old man in Bournemouth, Dorset, when they split and is now living illegally in the UK as her visa ran out on August 13, 2010. He has now been told by Kenyan and UK authorities that the documents used by Njenga for their marriage were fake so it is void and he is free to marry his fiancee. A spokesman from the UK Border Agency said they were aware of the case. He said: 'UKBA will investigate all allegations of immigration crime and will take action when it is considered necessary.” Pricila Njenga said: ""I refute the allegation that I only married Tim Reeves to gain the right to live in Britain. This was not the true basis of our relationship, which I considered entirely genuine in every respect.""Because our relationship broke down I chose to leave him.""We were reconciled in the hope of making our marriage work.""Unfortunately, his behaviour - in my opinion - meant I was unable to stay living with him and the relationship broke down again.""I refute any allegations of wrong-doing and wish to state my legal right to live and work in Britain and raise my daughter peacefully."" Moses Mbarue and Maryanne Wanja were all unavailable for comment.","Tim Reeves was dumped by Priscila Njenga the day after she received spouse’s visa following their wedding .

"Death: Eric Hobsbawm once described himself as an 'unrepentant communist' and was a towering figure on the British Left for decades . On Monday evening, the BBC altered its programme schedule to broadcast an hour-long tribute to an old man who had died aged 95, with fawning contributions from the likes of historian Simon Schama and Labour peer Melvyn Bragg. The next day, the Left-leaning Guardian filled not only the front page and the whole of an inside page but also devoted almost its entire G2 Supplement to the news. The Times devoted a leading article to the death, and a two-page obituary. You might imagine, given all this coverage and the fact that Tony Blair and Ed Miliband also went out of their way to pay tribute, that the nation was in mourning. Yet I do not believe that more than one in 10,000 people in this country had so much as heard of Eric Hobsbawm, the fashionable Hampstead Marxist who was the cause of all this attention. He had, after all, been open in his disdain for ordinary mortals. Hobsbawm came to Britain as a refugee from Hitler’s Europe before the war, but, as he said himself, he wished only to mix with intellectuals. ‘I refused all contact with the suburban petit bourgeoisie which I naturally regarded with contempt.’ Naturally. If the name Hobsbawm rings a bell at all, people might recollect that it was also the name of Julia Hobsbawm, a PR expert who, in collaboration with the future Mrs Gordon Brown, was one of the spin doctors who sold New Labour to this country. There is a world of difference between the ideology of Julia’s sleek, modern New Labour ideas and her father’s hard-nosed Stalinism, but one of the things they had in common was contempt for ‘ordinary people’. Eric Hobsbawm took part in one of the most extraordinary conversations ever on British television. Speaking in 1994 to the author Michael Ignatieff about the fall of the Berlin Wall five years earlier, the historian was asked how he felt about his earlier support for the Soviet Union. If Communism had achieved its aims, but at the cost of, say, 15 to 20 million people - as opposed to the 100million it actually killed in Russia and China - would Hobsbawm have supported it? His answer was a single word: ‘Yes’. Questionable support: Eric Hobsbawm's critics have accused him of being an apologist for the brutal policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin (right) Just imagine what would happen if some crazed Right-winger were to appear on BBC and say that the Nazis had been justified in killing six million Jews in order to achieve their aims. We should be horrified, and consider that such a person should never be allowed to speak in public again - or at least until he retracted his repellent views and admitted that he had been culpably, basely, wrong. Yet the awful thing about the phenomenon of Eric Hobsbawm is that the exact opposite to this is what happened. He was awarded a Companion of Honour by Tony Blair - one of the highest accolades it is possible to bestow upon a British intellectual. A professor of history, he was regularly lionised on the BBC and in the liberal newspapers as our ‘greatest’ historian. It is true he modified his hard-line support for Stalin and his death-camps as the years went by. The elderly Hobsbawm was not the same person who, in 1939, co-wrote a pamphlet defending not only Stalin but Hitler, too - and justifying the Nazi-Soviet pact to carve up Poland and dominate Eastern Europe. Hobsbawm suggested that the millions of deaths in gulag work camps were justified . But as far as the history of the 20th century was concerned, he never learned its lessons. The tens of millions dead, the hundreds of millions enslaved, the sheer evil falsity of the ideology which bore down with such horror on the peoples of Russia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Germany, never occurred to this man. He went on believing that a few mistakes had been made, and that Stalinism was 'disillusioning' - but that, in general, it would have been wonderful if Stalin had succeeded. Any barmy old fool is, thank . goodness, entitled to their point of view in our country. Unlike . Stalin’s Soviet Union or Hitler’s Germany, Britain is a country where . you can more or less say or think what you like. What . is disgraceful about the life of Hobsbawm is not so much that he . believed this poisonous codswallop, and propagated it in his lousy . books, but that such a huge swathe of our country’s intelligentsia - the . supposedly respectable media and chattering classes - bowed down before . him and made him their guru. Made him our ‘greatest historian’. In 1939 Hobsbawm co-wrote a pamphlet defending not only Stalin but Hitler, too - justifying the Nazi-Soviet pact to carve up Poland . The truth is that, far from being a great historian who sometimes made mistakes, Hobsbawm deliberately falsified history. In his book The Age Of Extreme, published in 1994, he quite deliberately underplayed the Soviet Union’s attack on Finland in 1939-40, saying it was merely an attempt to push the Russian border a little further away from Leningrad. He also omits any mention of the massacre of 20,000 Polish soldiers by Russian Secret Police at Katyn. In the same book, he dismisses the appallingly violent suppression by the Nazis of the Polish resistance in the 1944 Warsaw uprising - when a complacent Soviet army ignored desperate pleas to come to the Poles’ aid - as 'the penalty of a premature uprising'. These are not mistakes - they are wicked lies. In his 1997 book On History, he wrote the following: ‘Fragile as the communist systems turned out to be, only a limited, even minimal, use of force was necessary to maintain them from 1957 until 1989.’ This again is a blatant lie. A huge and ever-growing Soviet armaments industry ensured there was continued violence in most of the major trouble-spots of the world through those years before Communism collapsed. Thanks to the provision of Soviet support, weapons and armour, there was continued violence in Africa and, closer to home, in Ireland, where the IRA used Soviet arms. Ask the inhabitants of Prague, where Soviet tanks rolled into the streets in 1968, if they agreed with Hobsbawm that this was ‘minimal use of force’. Ask the millions of people who were taken from their homes by KGB thugs and forced to live, often for decades, in prison-camps throughout the Gulag, whether force had been ‘minimal’. Nor were Hobsbawm’s rewards merely the sycophantic praise heaped on him by Lefty academics and silly chatterers at London dinners. Having cultivated his group of Left-wing protégés at Birkbeck College in London, where he dominated the history department and went on to become President, he was showered with accolades by academics of the Left. Minimal force? Hobsbawm appeared to ignore the tactics used by the Soviets, such as when they invaded Prague in 1968 . In 2003, he won the Balzan Prize for European History, worth one million Swiss Francs — about half-a-million pounds at that date. The Leftist Sir Keith Thomas, a former president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, was on the board that awarded him the prize. There is also an intriguing question which hangs over Eric Hobsbawm. When he was at Cambridge during the Thirties he knew Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess and the other Soviet agents, who were recruited there by Marxist academics. Was he ever an agent himself? In extreme old age, four years ago, Hobsbawm attempted, under the Data Protection Act, to read the files kept on him by MI5. When talking about this, he used a very revealing phrase. He said he wanted to find out who had 'snitched on him'. It was always asserted by his pals that Hobsbawm was harmless, that he was not a traitor to Britain, and that he had certainly not recruited traitors. But if that was the case, why did he use the word 'snitched'? Why did he not say: 'It was monstrous that MI5 spied on me, and I’d like to see what is contained in the files'? Instead, he implied that he had done something of which the authorities were entitled to take a dim view - possibly something actively criminal. We, the petit-bourgeois of the suburbs whom he so despised, shall probably find out the truth one day. Hobsbawm himself will sink without trace. His books will not be read in the future. They are little better than propaganda, and, in spite of the slavish language in the obituaries, are badly written. What his death tells us, however, is that the liberal establishment that really runs this country has learned no lessons from history. It is still prepared to bow down and worship a man who openly hated Britain - and who knowingly wrote lies.","Historian defended the Soviet killing of millions in the name of Communism .

"The Premier League's big hitters have been handed a major boost in their quest to secure a deal for 18-year-old attacking midfielder Zakaria Bakkali. Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool are among the clubs to have been put on alert after the Belgian wonderkid's contract negotiations with PSV Eindhoven recently broke down. The likes of Arsenal and Tottenham are also reported to be tracking the youngster. Bakkali is regarded as one of the finest young stars in Europe, and has attracted interest from many of the major clubs around the continent after exploding on to the scene last year in Holland. VIDEO Scroll down for Watch sought after Zakaria Bakkali score a superb hat-trick . Wonderkid: Zakaria Bakkali (right) has attracted the attention of many of Europe's big hitters . Standing at under 5ft 5in tall, Bakkali has been compared to Sergio Aguero for bustling running and sharp shooting. He is extremely quick and possesses rapid acceleration as well as close ball control skills. He likes to run at players, cut in from the wings, and strike with either foot. Having impressed at various age levels he burst to prominence with a hat-trick against NEC in August last season aged just 17 years and 196 days. It made him the youngest player to achieve the feat in the history of the Dutch top-flight. He then went on to make his international debut for Belgium as a second-half substitute in their World Cup qualifier against Wales last October. Whilst PSV are hopeful of keeping the talented youngster, Bakkali has just 12 months remaining on his current deal, and is reportedly keen to move on either in January or next summer. Production line: The midfielder is set to be the latest young Belgian to take Europe by storm . Linked: Bakkali has been pursued by the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal .

PSV sporting director Marcel Brands has spoken of his disappointment at the prospect of losing Bakkali. 'Of course it's bad for the club,' he said. 'But I think it's actually worse for the player himself. It is a shame that a young player with talent does not choose the right path. 'People might think I am naive but I don't blame the guy or his father. 'The problem is that Zakaria is getting influenced by everything and everyone around him.'

"Mental compulsions: David Bass is plagued by thoughts that he has said something offensive . The words 'obsessive compulsive disorder' usually conjure up a picture of someone constantly washing their hands, or checking they have locked the door or turned off the stove. OCD, which affects one person in 100, causes obsessive, unwanted thoughts and images, which trigger compulsive, ritualistic behaviour. Physical acts such as washing and checking are the most common compulsions, but 10 to 15 per cent of sufferers carry out their rituals purely internally, in their minds. David Bass is one of them. 'My OCD's all going on in my head,' says David, 25, who is from Bedfordshire and worked as a TV presenter before becoming ill. David is plagued by thoughts that he has said something offensive - when talking to women, he panics needlessly that he has made sexually inappropriate remarks; when speaking to a black friend, he worries he has said something that could be construed as racist. As a result, he scans over everything he has just said. 'I feel compelled to replay everything I've said in my mind,' says David.  'Ironically, this means I zone out and may end up seeming rude anyway.' This form of the disorder is harder to treat - and because it's less recognised and there is no visible behaviour, can go unnoticed for years. Sufferers may not even realise they have it. Studies show there are many misconceptions surrounding OCD. Research published last month suggested that almost half the UK population believe they have mild obsessive compulsive disorder, when the true incidence is much lower - between 1 and 3 per cent of the population (ie, nearly a million people). Experts note that people frequently say they are 'a little bit OCD', meaning they like routine or need to double-check they have locked the front door - but this is to misunderstand what can be a devastating mental illness. 'Performing such rituals is not pleasurable,' says a spokesman for the National Institute of Mental Health. 'At best it provides temporary relief from the anxiety created by obsessive thoughts.' The form of OCD that David suffers from has been described as 'purely obsessional OCD' or 'pure O' because there is no visible compulsive behaviour (the 'C') - but this is another misconception. 'There's a myth that OCD can exist without the “C”,' says Professor David Mataix-Cols, a specialist in the disorder at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. 'A patient may suggest that they have only the obsessive part of the disorder, but we find they are doing lots of the compulsive behaviour inside their heads - for example, praying silently in an effort to calm their anxiety.' The stereotype: Hand-washing is one of the more common compulsions, but 10 to 15 per cent of those suffering from OCD carry out their rituals internally . For these patients, such rituals perform the same function that handwashing does for others, adds Dr David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist and OCD expert at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust. He explains that they try to get rid of the obsessive thoughts by distracting themselves or 'neutralising' the thoughts by performing mental rituals to try to calm their anxiety. 'But these ways of coping ultimately don't work - or make things worse,' says Dr Veale. Doctors can't explain why some people suffer only psychological symptoms, but Dr Veale says that such patients are often highly intelligent: 'They are likely to be analytical types, trying to solve things in their heads.' David Bass struggles with an exhausting range of mental compulsions. At the moment, he is suffering with an obsession that he may somehow end up  in prison. 'I keep worrying that I've knocked someone over when driving,' he says. 'I repeat, “You haven't, you haven't, you haven't” in my head to try to reassure myself.' He often attempts to suppress the disturbing thoughts that trigger his anxieties. 'I've done this a lot in church, where I've been plagued by the fear that I would shout out something blasphemous, such as “Jesus is a demon”,' he says. 'It's an unbearable thought so I try not to think it.' Unfortunately, this fuels the problem. It's a phenomenon known as the white bear effect, after studies in which healthy people were asked not to think of white bears, and found they could not help thinking of exactly that. Indeed, David is so overwhelmed by the thought of blaspheming in church that he no longer feels able to worship. We are all occasionally struck by unwanted thoughts. But while most of us can think of something else and move on, OCD sufferers become consumed by them. What causes the disorder is unknown but stress, genetics and childhood difficulties may all play a part. David, who has suffered with the condition from the age of 12, suspects that it runs in his family. His mother and maternal grandmother have both displayed compulsive behaviour. 'My mum once went on holiday and had to drive 50 miles back to check she hadn't left the gas on,' he recalls. 'I keep worrying that I've knocked . someone over when driving. I repeat, “You haven't, you . haven't, you haven't” in my head to try to reassure myself.' The disorder is generally very treatable. The standard treatments are drug therapy with antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a psychological method for helping people change their thinking and behaviour. But OCD with purely mental compulsions can be harder to overcome, says Dr Veale. This is because the standard CBT technique - gradually exposing patients to what they fear, and teaching them how to respond - is harder to apply. David overcame an obsession with hygiene when he was a teenager using this approach. 'I was particularly scared of dog muck,' says David, who became so unwell that he would feel  compelled to open doors with his feet and wash his hands until they bled. As part of his therapy, he had to hold a shoe and not wash his hands afterwards. 'It sounds strange but it worked,' he says. He was well between the ages of 14 and 16. But then the illness returned, this time with purely mental compulsions. OCD symptoms often change in this way, according to Dr Veale. Unfortunately, David is struggling to apply exposure therapy to his 'What if I've said or done something awful?' thoughts. Exposing oneself to something tangible, such as dirt, is easier. David is taking the antidepressant sertraline and being encouraged by his therapist to face his fears by, for example, telling himself that he has actually knocked over a cyclist, and picturing the scene in as much detail as possible. He must then resist the urge to neutralise the frightening thought or image with his mental rituals of saying to himself 'you haven't, you haven't'. 'Being properly frightened, and learning that you can calm down on your own without ritualising is essential,' says Professor Mataix-Cols. Dr Veale says it's also important to help patients understand the context in which the obsessions are occurring. 'It's usually at a time of great stress or linked to some emotional memory,' he says. Perhaps the most important therapy for patients like David, whose anguish has often left him unable to leave the house, is to try to lead as normal a life as possible. 'It's crucial to get out there and do the things that are important to you,' says Dr Veale. n For more information, see ocdaction.org.uk and ocduk.org .","Physical acts are the most common forms of compulsion .

The photo has been put up for sale by the descendants of Arthur Knight, a trained photographer who was the son of pioneer diamond miner William Knight . He was . part of a scouting expedition on an armoured train when it was attacked by the . enemy. Churchill's . heroics during the ambush led to speculation that he would receive the . Victoria Cross, although this never happened. He was . taken to a prison camp in Pretoria but a month later he made his escape and . travelled 300 miles to safety. He became . a national hero, but it was not enough for Churchill who then joined the army . and helped relieve the British at the Siege of Ladysmith and then take . Pretoria.

This . vintage photograph is not recognised by any experts in the field and is . expected to make hundreds of pounds when it goes under the hammer at auction. It has . been consigned for sale by the descendants of Arthur Knight, a trained . photographer who was the son of pioneer diamond miner William Knight. When Churchill escaped from the PoW camp, a wanted poster was issued, offering £25 for the young war correspondent's recapture. The Boer authorities distributed a description of him, noting that he could not speak a word of Dutch. Despite this, he made it to safety. Boer commander PJ Joubert, who had imprisoned Churchill two months earlier, said: 'He is just n'klein koerant-skrywertjie' - 'he's just a little newspaper man'. Soon after gaining his freedom, Churchill joined the South African Light Horse, an irregular cavalry unit which fought his former captors. For the next few months, he stayed on in South Africa as a soldier/correspondent, thrilling readers with his reportage and slow march to victory. Arthur . trained as a photographer with David Barnett of Johannesburg and it is likely . that this shot of Churchill was taken either by Barnett or by Arthur Knight . himself. It shows . Churchill surrounded by men of The South African Light Horse Regiment and on . the back of the photo it says 'Winston Churchill after Escape'. Andrew Marlborough, from Duke's of Dorchester in Dorset, which is selling the . picture, said: 'This could be a major find. 'Our . research so far suggests that this is an unrecorded photo. It shows him astride . his grey horse surrounded by troops. 'The . troops are from the South African Light Horse Regiment, which was who Churchill . was with in his role as a newspaper correspondent.

'This . photograph is likely to have been taken by Arthur Knight or David Barnett and . is part of a large archive from the same source. 'These . include images of Lord Kitchener, General Christiaan De Wet, President Paul . Kruger, as well as views on London and Brighton in the late 19th and early 20th . century.' During the second Boer War that started in October 1899 between . Britain the the Boer Republics, Churchill obtained a commission to act as a war . correspondent. He had . recently failed to be elected to the house of commons and went to South Africa . to report for the Morning Post on £250 a month. In a . dispatch, Churchill told of his escape and wrote: 'I therefore resolved to . escape, and the same night I left the State School's prison, in Pretoria by . climbing the wall when the sentries' backs were turned momentarily.' He . told how he walked through the town 'without disguise' and met many 'burghers' then managed to board a train and hid under coal sacks.

"Vindication? Austerity champion George Osborne . The number of people in work hit a record high yesterday – giving another significant pre-election boost to the Tories. Official figures show that there are 1.85million more people in employment now than when the Coalition came to power in May 2010. The economy has bounced back to such an extent that last year an average of 1,600 people found work every day. The Office for National Statistics also revealed that wage growth is outpacing inflation at the fastest rate in almost five years – leaving people with more money in their pockets. The jobs and wages figures came amid a flurry of good economic news: . In an attempt to pour cold water on the positive statistics, Labour claimed too many of the jobs were low paid and pointed to a small rise in youth unemployment. But speaking to workers at a Rolls-Royce plant in West Sussex, Mr Cameron said: ‘We inherited a situation where far too many people were unemployed, where we weren’t creating enough jobs in our country. ‘Since I became Prime Minister, we haven’t solved or tackled all of unemployment, but we have got 1.85million more people in work today than when I became Prime Minister. ‘I sit round that European Union council table with the 27 other countries – I was there last week. Britain, in the last four years, has created more jobs than the rest of Europe put together, so we are on our way.’ On a visit to Felixstowe, Suffolk, today, Mr Cameron will promise a ‘brighter future for hard-working people’ ahead of a speech to business leaders. He will say: ‘Our long-term economic plan is working. I am determined to go further and we will keep working through our plan to secure a brighter future for hard-working people.’ Yesterday’s figures showed that three quarters of all Britons aged 16 to 64 are now in work after the employment rate reached 73.2 per cent. This is the joint highest level since records began in 1971, the same figure having also been achieved in 2004 and 2005. There are now 608,000 more people in employment than a year ago. That is 30.89million people in work compared with 29.04million in April 2010, the last month before the Government came to power. The unemployment rate has also tumbled and is now 5.7 per cent, the lowest in seven years. The UK has the third lowest rate in the European Union, behind only Austria and Germany. The number claiming jobseeker’s allowance fell by 38,600 in January to 823,000, the 27th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest since 2008. Pay rises, excluding bonuses, rose by 1.7 per cent in the year to December, which is lower than last month’s growth of 1.8 per cent, but still more than three times higher than inflation that month of 0.5 per cent. Inflation has since dropped again to 0.3 per cent – a 55-year low – further easing the squeeze on family finances as the cost of living falls. Including bonuses, workers saw a pay rise of 2.1 per cent in the past 12 months, the highest rate since 2011. Confident: Speaking to workers at a Rolls-Royce plant in West Sussex, pictured, Mr Cameron said: 'Britain, in the last four years, has created more jobs than the rest of Europe put together, so we are on our way' John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Many of our members have told us that they intend to expand their businesses and hire staff this year, and so we would expect these positive trends in the headline jobs data to continue in the coming months.’ James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said wages would continue to rise as competition for talent intensified. ‘Two thirds of IoD members are planning pay rises at least in line with inflation over the coming months,’ he added. Labour was last night accused of ‘talking down the economy’ by highlighting a small rise in youth unemployment – despite the fact that the overall jobless total fell sharply. The number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work rose by 3,000 between October and December to 740,000. Labour said the figure was ‘extremely worrying’ – even though youth unemployment has actually fallen by 21 per cent or 198,000 under the Coalition, having risen by nearly 44 per cent under the last Labour government. Tory MP Mark Garnier said: ‘Labour is talking down the economy ... [the party] is proving it is not good for Britain.’","1.85m more people in employment than when Coalition came to power .

"Barack Obama is slipping in early voting in key areas of crucial swing states, bolstering the Romney campaign’s claim that greater Republican enthusiasm will sweep their man to victory next Tuesday. But Romney held back his criticism of Obama on the campaign trail in Florida in deference to the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy while the president toured devastated areas of New Jersey. Democrats traditionally hold a marked advantage over Republicans in early voting.

Romney walks to his campaign plane with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, 2nd left, U.S. Representative Connie Mack, 2nd right and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, right . In terms of party registration, Democrats hold a narrow overall lead of 43 to 41 per cent but are clearly not going to match their 46 to 37  per cent advantage of 2008. Although Obama appeared to make big strides on the first two days of eight-day period for in-person early voting, his pace slowed  on Monday and Tuesday.  Democrats netted 73,000 vote from the first two days, but gained 28,000 votes on Monday and just 16,000 votes on Tuesday. In the meantime, Republicans lead among absentee ballots by 70,000 votes. Democrats won the combined early vote by more than 360,000 in 2008 and currently lead by just 49,000. More Republicans than Democrats have voted early in Colorado, suggesting that the swing state, where Obama campaigns on Thursday, could be slipping from the President’s grasp. In North Carolina, which Obama won by just 14,000 votes in 2008, Romney has cut the Democratic early voting advantage by 100,000. Obama has not visited the state since September and Democrats have privately conceded that he is unlikely to win it. In Nevada, Obama is also well behind his 2008 support in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County, where he will also campaign tomorrow. ‘We're wildly over-performing in Republican McCain counties and Obama's significantly underperforming in Florida, Virginia, Ohio, Iowa and North Carolina compared to 2008,’ a senior Romney strategist told MailOnline. ‘You go county by county and we are very happy where we are. We have leads among election day voters and independents. The Obama campaign is saying it's a 2008 model. But it's not. Obama needs to win independents.’ On a conference call with reporters, Rich Beeson, Romney’s political director, said: ‘In Florida right now about 2.2 million votes have been cast in early and absentee. Right now as of today only 39,645 more Democrats have voted than Republicans. When you look at the independent break in each state, they are behind where they need to be going into election day next week. ‘We will win election day by double digits in Florida so they clearly are in a bad place going into day. They have three more days of early vote but they also have four so far where they have not made up any ground.’ In Ohio, in counties that Senator John McCain won in 2008 Republicans are 11 per up from where they were in 2008.  In 35 McCain counties, turnout is 100 per cent up but this is only the case in 10 Obama counties.

President Barack Obama, left, embraces a victim of the storm and right, speaks in a neighborhood after he tours damage done by Hurricane Sandy in Brigantine, New Jersey today . The Romney campaign is increasingly confident it will win in Iowa, which Obama won in 2008 and where his caucuses victory over Hillary Clinton launched him on the way to the White House. ‘Iowa is a state where there's a very clear line of demarcation,’ Beeson said. ‘Democrats tend to vote absentee and Republicans vote on election day. If the Democrats go into election day with less than a 130,000 lead on partisan registration and independents break, then we will win Iowa.’ Campaigning in Tampa Bay, Florida, Romney avoided his usual ferocious attacks on Obama and instead concentrated on his own five-point plan for growing the economy. ‘You should know I could not be in this race if I were not an optimist,’ he said. ‘I believe in the future of this country I know we have huge challenges, but I’m not frightened by them, I’m invigorated by the challenge. We’re going to take on these challenges we’re going to overcome them!’ Romney took care to call for donations to the Red Cross. Earlier, he had donated an undisclosed amount himself, according to his aides. ‘If you have an extra dollar or two, send them along and keep the people who are in harms – who have been in harm’s way, who’ve been damaged either personally or through their property, keep them in your thoughts and prayers’ he said. ‘We love all of our fellow citizens.  We come together in times like this and we want to make sure that they have a speedy and quick recovery from their financial and in many cases, personal loss. But Romney did indirectly criticise Obama for his handling of the economy. ‘My view is pretty straight forward and that is I believe that this is time for America to take a different course, that this should be a turning point for our country, and I say that because I look at where we are and with 23 million Americans – you think about that,’ he said. ‘These are real people. These are folks trying to put food on the table.  23 million people struggling to find a good job. This is something that requires in my view a different path than we’ve been on.’ Obama will return to the campaign trail on Thursday with events in Wisconsin, Nevada and Colorado while Romney will campaign in Virginia.

The 24 year-old Dane was leading Shuai Peng 7-6, 4-3 when the Chinese player started flexing her leg before becoming unable to walk with severe pain in her legs. There then followed first an off court medical evaluation, and then a full injury time out, as she was treated for what amounts to a loss of physical condition. VIDEO Scroll down for  great footage of Caroline Wozniacki including her ice bucket challenge and a day at the beach with Serena Williams . Agony: Shuai Peng is taken off the court by wheelchair after retiring from women's singles semi-final . Distraught: Shuai Peng has struggled breathing after collapsing twice on court during US Open semi-final . Concern: Shuai Peng of China is taken off the court by wheelchair . Despite this the rules allowed her to carry on after a ten minute hiatus without any penalty, but four points later Peng crumpled into a heap on court and went into major spasms in her upper body, upon which there was no option but to retire. A complete re-examination of the regulations can wait for another day as it was, ultimately, unfair on Wozniacki, but the main focus was on the health of Peng, who had to be pushed off in a wheelchair with a doctor in attendance, leaving Wozniacki to understandably muted celebrations of a huge achievement in reaching her second US Open final, where she will face world No 1 Serena Williams. She said: 'It was really hard to watch for me whenever I saw her collapse on the court. Tennis is great, but health is more important. 'To see her struggling out there, I just wanted to make sure she was okay. I got the word that she's okay now and just getting cooled down, so that's great to hear. 'I know that she had heart surgery when she was 13, so that's definitely something that I think she was worried about, as well.' Pain: Peng crumpled into a heap on court and went into major spasms . Distress: Shuai Peng of China is attended by medical staff after she slumped to the court . Concern: Caroline Wozniacki checks on Shuai Peng after she collapsed on court . Tournament director David Brewer confirmed Peng had recovered well enough to return to the locker room and that the doctor, player and trainer all agreed it would not be physically harmful to her to try to play on. Wozniacki had her own fitness concerns having been in bed with a cold for the previous two days but said she would 'come out firing' on Sunday. The Dane was 19 and rocketing to the top of the game when she last reached the final, and it has been a bumpy road to get back. 'I have goose bumps right now,' she said. 'It's been five years since I've been in the final here so it's incredible to be back.' And so the three months of her life that have unfolded in a way that Wozniacki could never have envisaged may end in extraordinary fashion with her winning the first Grand Slam of her career. Humidity: Caroline Wozniacki applies an ice pack to her face during a break between games . Struggle: Wozniacki feels the heat during semi-final against Peng Shuai . From the slough of despond she fell into after Rory McIlroy broke off their engagement in May she has risen magnificently, all the way to the opportunity for a massive career breakthrough. Wozniacki arrived in it via a hard fought progression which, before the medical issues arose, was, in keeping with her life of late, much harder than expected. The 24 year-old Dane is searching for the first Grand Slam as a professional, despite having twice ended a season as the world No 1 through her overall consistency. It was five years ago at Flushing Meadows that she made the final, and there appeared absolutely no prospect of that occurring again back in May, when her personal life was sedate but her on court fortunes seriously on the wane. As her former fiancée prepared to tee off in Denver Wozniacki walked out onto the Arthur Ashe Stadium in steaming temperatures accompanied by a brisk wind that will have contributed to Peng's eventual demise. In 37 Grand Slams the 28 year-old Chinese had never reached a semi-final, and prior to this was much better known for her prowess in doubles, which sees her ranked as the world's No 3 player. Power: The 24 year-old Dane was leading Shuai Peng 7-6 4-3 when her opponent retired . Target: Wozniacki has the chance to secure her first Grand Slam title . Yet her surge in form while flying solo had been such that in five matches she had not dropped a set, and had only conceded three service games, even fewer than the likes of Williams. From the start her flatly hit groundstrokes caused the Dane problems, while the wind was causing trouble with her serve, leading to five double faults in all during the first set. Twice Wozniacki needed to come back from a break down before romping through the tiebreak 7-1 after Peng had served for it at 6-5. The second set was also hard fought, and even in her brief return from treatment Peng managed to force a break point to get back to 4-4 before bowing the inevitable, given her rapidly deteriorating physical state. The incident will be accompanied by calls for more changes to procedures on the WTA Tour, after a similar incident at the Australian Open involving Victoria Azarenka against Sloane Stephens.","Peng Shuai collapsed during the second set of US Open semi-final .

"Unpaid council tax is adding up to £450 for every home in some areas of the country, with town halls accused of turning a 'blind eye' to people who refuse to pay up. Latest figures show £2.5billion is owed in council tax areas in England, equivalent to more than £100 for every home in the country, with £3 in every £100 going uncollected last year. The government has named Liverpool as the 'worst' at tackling the problem, with arrears totalling £450 per family, compared to Amber Valley in Derbyshire where the figure is just £14. Scrolls down for video . Many councils in London and the North West of England are owed millions in unpaid council tax, worth up to £450 per household, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government . A league table shows that Liverpool was owed £98million in council tax arrears in March this year, worth £450 for every family in the city. London councils also have some of the highest amounts of arrears per household. In Haringey, north London, the figure was £366, Hackney £321, Newham £299 and Lewisham £290. Other councils in the top 10 include Salford, Luton, Manchester, Barking and Dagenham and Birmingham, where £245 is owed for each of the £430,000 homes. Despite increased pressure on local authorities, with deep cuts in their budgets, the amount of money they collected in council tax last year actually fell. Just 97 per cent of the levy was paid in 2013-14, compared to 97.4 per cent a year earlier. It means town halls' performance is now no better than it was in 2008. The government insists that the growing council tax debt mountain is a 'significant potential source of income' which councils could use to support frontline services or freeze bills. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said that many of the worst offenders were run by Labour, who were failing to tackle the problem. He told MailOnline: 'The Labour councils which complain the most about lack of government handouts are the ones with the worst records for not collecting their own taxes and these new figures show how incompetent they are. 'By failing to get these payments they are not only turning a blind eye to tax evasion but driving up council tax costs for honest citizens as well. 'Every penny of council tax that is not collected by town halls means a higher bill for the law-abiding citizens who do pay on time. 'By tackling this tax loss, these figures show that there is real scope for sensible savings by councils to help pay off the Labour Government's deficit and freeze council tax down again this year.' However, Liverpool City Council hit back, insisting it was working hard to reduce the amount owed and last year cut the bill by £33.5million. Last year it collected £7.6 million in historic Council Tax arrears and around £280,000 of Poll Tax debt. Officials had ruled out writing off a proportion of historic debt, as some councils do, choosing instead to work on trying to claw it back from families who owe it. A council spokesman said: 'Our collection rate is as good as other large cities, at around 95 per cent. However, unlike other councils we will not simply automatically write off arrears after five years. 'We believe that people should pay their way, and letting them off the hook robs other council tax payers of vital public services. 'This is money that the council would not otherwise have had and is helping offset the £156 million we have to save over the next three years due to cuts in Central Government funding.' In Salford, £30.7million is owed in arrears, equivalent to £277,43 for every home.  Councillor Bill Hinds, responsible for finance on the council, said: 'We do all we can legally to peruse the debts but in some circumstances it is not possible or financially viable to pursue the debt; if somebody has died, or left the country, for example. 'The decision to write off a debt is only ever taken as a last resort when all of our investigations have been exhausted or where it would no longer be cost effective for the council to peruse the case. 'This is good accounting practice across all organisations and the Audit Commission's Use of Resources Score highlights that we manage our resources well.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said Labour councils were failing to tackle the problem of collecting council tax arrears, which could be used to support frontline services . Amber Valley is named by the government as the 'best' council for tackling council tax arrears, worth just £14 per household. Sylvia Delahay, executive director at Amber Valley Borough Council, said: 'The Council has a robust system in place to monitor the level of Council Tax arrears. 'This process involves regular reminders being sent out and seeking to manage arrears at the earliest point and not allowing arrears to accumulate. 'In cases where there is no response or effort made to pay, then formal recovery action will be taken in order to protect the council. The low level of arrears benefits all the council tax payers in the Borough by ensuring that the provision that the council has to provide for non-payment is kept to a minimum.' The Department for Communities and Local Government has produced a document for councils called '50 ways to save', which includes improving council tax collection rates and reducing arrears 'as a key way of making sensible savings to help keep overall council tax bills down and protect frontline services'.","£2.5billion is owed in unpaid council tax in England, latest figures show .

"Xabi Alonso insists he is still hungry for success at Bayern Munich despite two Champions League wins, a World Cup victory and two European championship titles.

'I thought I needed a new challenge and there is nothing bigger than playing for Bayern,' Alonso said on Sunday, a day after his Bayern debut in their 1-1 draw against Schalke.

"An eight-year-old boy was saved from a deadly bee attack by his pit bull dog who dragged him to safety to prevent him from being stung further. Jesse-Cole Shaver, 8, from Oregon, was out with 10 neighbourhood friends in a local wood, exploring a creek, when someone stepped on a rotten log unleashing a swarm of bees. The terrified children were down a steep embankment behind their apartment building in Oregon City when the deadly bees filled the air, stinging little Jesse-Cole at least 24 times. Scroll down for video . Bee attack: Jesse-Cole Shaver, 8, from Oregon, recalls the moment that he was out in a local wood and a swarm of bees attacked him . Trail: The terrified children were down a steep embankment, pictured here, behind their apartment building when the deadly bees filled the air . Rescue: Luckily pit bull Hades came to the rescue dragging Jesse-Cole back up the hill to safety after he was unable to climb by himself . The attack left the boy unable to climb back up the hill to safety. But luckily his pit bull Hades came to the rescue. ‘Hades saw me and came and she dragged me up to the grass and then stopped and let me crawl on her back and then took me to mom,’ Jesse- told KPTV in Oregon. His frightened mom, who does not want to be named, said: ‘I just heard a bunch of screaming, then I saw my dog dragging my son up by his pants.’ Meanwhile, his big sister was also stung five times in what could have been a deadly attack because she's allergic to bees. Hospital: Jesse-Cole and his sister Jasmine, left, were taken to hospital where doctors were still battling to remove the deadly bees from the children's hair . Hugs: Jesse-Cole could not wait to leave hospital and hug his dog to say thank-you . She had to be given two injections from an EpiPen to prevent her body from swelling in reaction to the stings. ‘It . felt like a bunch of needles went into my skin, and I didn't know what . was going on until the girl started yelling, 'Bees!' Jasmine said. Today, the family say they are incredibly grateful for their dog’s quick thinking actions. Jesse-Cole and his sister were taken to Willamette Falls Hospital where doctors were still battling to remove even more deadly bees from the children’s hair, according to their mom. And she fears that it could have been much worst if it weren’t for their dog’s life saving actions. ‘A couple of these kids could have got really sick or died, I'm sure of it,’ she said. Brave Hades was also stung several times during the attack - but everyone is now fine. His proud owner Jesse-Cole could not wait to leave hospital and give him a big hug to thank him, his mom said.

"At the final whistle, a gentleman behind the press box cursed loudly and luridly. The small boy alongside him tugged at the sleeve of his overcoat: ‘Can we go home now, Dad? Can we, Dad? Pleeeese!’ And as we sat in the freezing dusk of London SE7, struggling to take in a terrible football match, all our sympathy went out to the child. Charlton fans are a tolerant lot. They always have been. But the boos and jeers which rang around The Valley at full-time after a 1-1 draw were seething with well-founded frustration. They were enjoying a perfectly outrageous lead through Jordan Cousins going into the second minute of added time, when they collectively backed off a woefully ordinary Rotherham side, allowing them to attack at will. The equalising goal from the substitute Danny Ward was the entirely predictable outcome. Both sides are involved in what the sporting prints used to term ‘a relegation dogfight’. There are seasons when football fans yearn for mid-table mediocrity, and for Charlton fans, this is just such a season. Charlton have not won at home since the end of October. They have won nowhere since early November, and have now drawn 15 of their 28 Championship matches. Small wonder that the fans’ charity is wearing thin. Charlton boss Guy Luzon took charge of his first home match since taking over the reins at The Valley . The Addicks react after conceding a late goal against Rotherham on Saturday afternoon . Jordan Cousins had put Charlton in the lead during the 83rd minute of the Championship encounter . Guy Luzon is their fourth manager within the past 12 months. This was his first home game in charge, and within 61 minutes, those tolerant fans were chanting ‘You don’t know what you’re doing!’ This may well be a new English record. Summing up his debut last week, Luzon said: ‘The first thing we needed to stop was conceding goals. After that, we need to score.’ Saturday night, he was singing a similar song. These are early days, of course, but I fear he is unlikely to stay long enough to collect a testimonial. If I seem concerned, then I confess all. For the best part of half a century, I have observed the code of neutrality when covering football matches. Saturday, the final assignment, I shamelessly cast it aside. Like most fans of clubs like Charlton, I hope for the best but know that the worst is on its way. Even when things were going well, during those years in the first half of the noughties, when Alan Curbishley was keeping us in the Premier League, we knew it was only a matter of time. And so it proved. The club is now owned by a chap who is apparently the 18th richest man in Belgium. This would be encouraging if Standard Liege were not his passion and Charlton his London bit on the side. The result is a football club which seems curiously unloved and under invested. Of course, we have known far worse times than this. Extended banishment to the dreaded Selhurst Park was once the only antidote to closure. Charlton have struggled to replace former boss Alan Curbishley, who left in 2006 . It took perhaps the finest, most resourceful supporter involvement that the English game has ever seen to eventually negotiate a return to The Valley. By comparison, these are almost halcyon days. But it didn’t feel like that on Saturday. The match programme, featuring a cover picture of Clive Mendonca only made things worse, with its memories of better days. May 25, 1998, most Charlton fans could recall that date as readily as their own birthday. The best match ever staged at Wembley; including the ’66 World Cup final, the ’53 Stanley Matthews final, the lot. And Mendonca scored a sensational hat-trick, as Charlton clawed their way back time and again to secure a 4-4 draw. Thirteen penalties later, they beat Sunderland to enter the Premier League. Under Alan Curbishley, it was the Charlton version of a golden age. It seemed an eternity ago, as Luzon bounded along the touchline, waving a hand, bawling unheard into the middle distance. I doubt that Curbishley would have bounded quite so pointlessly, nor that other Charlton managers of yore — Theo Foley, Lennie Lawrence, Eddie Firmani and others — would have gone ignored. Still, the fate of the Charlton follower is to look back at the way things were. Charlton owner Roland Duchatelet appears to focus the majority of his attention on Standard Liege . Charlton had to relocate to Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park while The Valley, pictured in 1988, was renovated . And here's what The Valley or SE7, as it is also known, looked like back in the 1950s . The young local reporters present were far more sanguine than we veterans on Saturday. I envied their confidence, their assumption that things would work out fine. Back in the Stone Ages, I used to cover the occasional Charlton match for the local paper. In my second or third game, as a novice reporter, I described a Charlton centre half as ‘The finest in the Second Division’. The Sports Editor was a kind man. ‘I take it you’ve seen all the others?’ he enquired. Naturally, I hadn’t. He smiled, and sent me off to make the office tea. After so many years, I have learned the danger of such sweeping judgements, yet still there is the conviction that what can go wrong, will go utterly wrong where Charlton are concerned. And yet, as the followers of such football clubs will tell you, it isn’t the despair that gets to you; it’s the hope. For all the disappointments  at The Valley, all the evidence of a team in tatters, we cling to that hope in the face of form and logic. Neutrality is now forgotten. The next stage is a return to partisan status. Unashamed. Meanwhile, on the far side of London, over to the west, an oligarch’s whimsical investment was preparing to play a sheik’s vanity project. Stamford Bridge is 12 miles from The Valley. For all they now have in common, it may as well be on the moon. And yet, we wouldn’t swap it for all the oil in Arabia. For SE7 is home. And home is where the heart is.","Patrick Collins chooses to sign off his his remarkable career by reflecting on life as a Charlton supporter .

"The ice-bucket challenge has been making more headlines and, as someone who found themselves nominated to do it, I can confirm it is not something you would want to do twice. I found myself nominated by a fellow England player and had no intention of pulling out,so I got drenched at Melwood, Liverpool’s training ground, earlier this week and I quickly handed the baton over to Craig Noone, the Cardiff City winger.

"CLICK HERE to see why Richie McCaw will make history for New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium . Going up against the All Blacks is always an exciting challenge — especially when you face guys like Julian Savea. He is a fantastic winger and some people have said he is even better than Jonah Lomu . . . but Jonah will always be the man in my opinion! Savea is an exceptional athlete who gets himself in the right place at the right time. He takes his chances very well and pops up where people don’t want to see him. His scoring record speaks for itself but it’s unfair to compare him to Lomu, because who knows how good Lomu could have been with all the facilities we have in the modern game? The New Zealand squad is oozing quality and Savea  is just one example. Sonny Bill Williams is a player I love to watch and he’s shown his quality by switching straight back from rugby league to international rugby union. George North cannot wait to face New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday . North (third right) and team-mates react after a poor performance against Fiji in their previous Autumn Test . Then there’s Richie McCaw, the face of the All Blacks. He will captain the side for the 100th time on Saturday and that sums up the man … most players don’t get up to 100 Tests, let alone as skipper. They do have an aura about them because they are the world’s best team. It’s the same with any sports team who are at the top of their game. We just have to go in with confidence and belief in our own abilities, which is something we all have. Over the past few games they have shown they’re human and they do make mistakes. I guess what sets them apart is that even when they’re on the back foot, they still manage to grind out the results. Hopefully we can push them over the edge. On a personal note, I can’t wait to face the haka again. Some people say it gives New Zealand an unfair advantage and should be banned, but it’s a tradition of the game and I think it should carry on. It’s supposed to be intimidating, but if you can’t handle it then you’re probably not going to be able to manage a game of international rugby either. I first faced it in 2010 — it was quite daunting as an 18-year-old lad but it’s just part of the game. Julian Savea has been compared to New Zealand rugby legend Jonah Lomu . Richie McCaw will make history by captaining the All Blacks for a 100th Test on Saturday . Wales coach Warren Gatland (right) leads a training session after the 'disappointment' of the Fiji win . Fiji had their own war dance last weekend, but the less said about that game the better. It was a tough day for everyone involved and we know we didn’t perform well. Warren Gatland was like a disappointed dad in the changing room afterwards. It was one of those ‘I’m not angry… I’m disappointed,’ moments. Our basic skills weren’t there and we got turned over 22 times. That’s not acceptable in international rugby; it was schoolboy level and we let ourselves down. Now we pick ourselves up and get ready to raise our game against the All Blacks. We had a funny quiz on Monday night that was organised by Gethin Jenkins. It was a chance to get all the boys together and have a laugh. I was put in a team with Rhys Webb, James Hook and Dan Biggar. On paper we should have won it but we only managed fourth place. The team captained by Bradley Davies took the trophy in the end . . . I’m not quite sure how that happened! Jamie Roberts and Nemani Nadolo, the huge Fijian centre, swapped shirts after the game on Saturday. Jamie likes to think he’s the big man but Nadolo beat him there . . . he was massive! It’s safe to say Nadolo’s shirt might be a bit baggy on the Doc! North is a massive fan of New Zealand's war dance the haka, performed here against Scotland . Jamie Roberts (right) met his match when he swapped shirts with Fiji's Nemani Nadola (left) We’ve been following the progress of the Wales football team in camp. They’re doing really well at the moment — drawing 0-0 with Belgium on Sunday — and that’s good to see. I’m not the biggest football lover but if I had to pick a team then it would probably be Liverpool. Justin Tipuric and Dan Biggar are the biggest fans in the squad and I’m sure they would love it if Gareth Bale came to visit one day.

"Raising his arm into a Usain Bolt pose, Michael Adebolajo kisses a copy of the Koran with his eyes closed. The terror suspect went through this routine as he appeared in court yesterday accused of murdering Drummer Lee Rigby. Stooping in the dock with a large bandage on his left arm, the 28-year-old demanded to be called ‘Abu Hamza’. In court: Raising his arm into a Usain Bolt pose, Michael Adebolajo kisses a copy of the Koran with his eyes closed . Exchange: Court artist sketch by Elizabeth Cook of a member of the public gallery blowing kisses at Michael Adebolajo in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court . Clutching a copy of the Koran in his right hand, Adebolajo repeatedly interrupted the hearing. At one point he said: ‘I’m only a man. I would like to alleviate the pain if I may.’ Then suddenly he held his . hands aloft and closed his eyes before kissing the Koran. Throughout the 12-minute hearing . Adebolajo blew kisses towards a relative in the public gallery, . understood to be his younger brother Jeremiah. Accused: Adebolajo is facing a murder charge . Wearing a white T-shirt and trousers, . he remained seated when deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnott entered . Westminster Magistrates Court in London for the hearing. When he was told to stand by the court . clerk, he asked: ‘May I ask why?’ The defendant was then told it was a . customary part of the court process, to which he replied: ‘Then I will . sit’. Addressing Adebolajo, the court clerk said: ‘I understand that you wish to be known as Mujahid Abu Hamza.’ The defendant replied: ‘That is correct.’ He was then referred to as ‘Mr Abu Hamza’ throughout the remainder of the hearing. Adebolajo is accused of killing Drummer Rigby, 25, just yards from Woolwich army barracks in broad daylight on May 22. Drummer Rigby, who leaves behind a two . year-old son called Jack and a fiancée, died from multiple stab wounds . and had to be identified by his dental records. Unusual: Michael Adebolajo made a series of gestures in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court, including kissing the Koran while pointing the the sky . Hearing: Woolwich suspect Michael Adebolajo, whose left arm was heavily bandaged, refused to stand in court yesterday morning and held the Koran throughout . Gesture: Those in court said that Adebolajo apparently blew kisses to this man from the dock, the unnamed named then reportedly pointed to the sky . Adebolajo, from Romford, Essex, was . shot by police and spent just over a week being treated for his injuries . under armed guard in hospital. The defendant is also charged with attempting to murder two police officers, known as E38 and D49. He faces a fourth charge of possessing . a 9.4mm revolver with intent to cause persons to believe that unlawful . violence would be used against him. Hearing:  A police van drives Michael Adebolajo into Westminster Magistrates' Court, to face charges linked to the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich . Guard: Armed police closed off roads around the court as the prisoner was swept into the central London court . High profile: Adebolajo, 28, who was inside this van, is accused of a series of crimes linked to Drummer Rigby . Shouting from the dock in a slightly . slurred voice, Adebolajo said: ‘May I respond please? I’m not sure I’ve . heard those specific charges put to me like that before.’ Court case: Adebolajo  appeared to blow a kiss to this man understood to be his brother Jeremiah, who was pictured outside court . The magistrate told him it  was normal procedure for suspects to have the charges read out  to them. To which Adebolajo replied: ‘I’ve got . an idea, somewhere along the line a jobs-worth came up with a very . foolish rule that a criminal, or so-called criminals, in the dock may . not respond. For what reason?’ Mrs Arbuthnott told him that most suspects wanted to know the charges they faced. Adebolajo replied: ‘You are  correct and I do not disagree  with that.’ As the hearing progressed Adebolajo – . who was flanked by two plain clothes police officers and a security . guard – suddenly seemed happy to stand up when asked. At one point David Gottlieb, defending, told him to calm  down and said it was just a  ‘routine hearing’. The court heard that the police have instructed a ‘world famous forensic psychologist’ to help them with their investigation. Mark Topping, a specialist prosecutor . from the Crown Prosecution Service’s counter terrorism division, said: . ‘The Crown says the charges are indictable only and they must be sent to . the Central Criminal Court.’ Adebolajo was remanded into custody and . will appear at the Old Bailey either today or tomorrow for a procedural . hearing. He will then appear at the same court . on June 28 alongside Michael Adebowale, who appeared in court last week . charged with the murder of Drummer Rigby. Charges: Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) are accused of murdering Lee Rigby and other related charges . Ring of steel: Armed police outside Westminster Magistrates' Court to deal with the appearance of Michael Adebolajo, 28 . Police presence: Large numbers of officers were brought into Central London to guard the court while Adebolajo was inside . Tragic: Drummer Lee Rigby died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, but Choudary says the Koran teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-Muslims . Outside court armed officers patrolled the streets with unarmed colleagues. Meanwhile, at a short procedural . hearing at the Old Bailey, Adebowale, 22, was once again ordered to . remain in custody until June 28. Neither defendant has entered pleas to any of the charges. Eight other people have been arrested during the investigation into Drummer Rigby’s death. Six men, aged between 21 and 50, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. All have been released on police bail. Rikki Thomas, 29, who is understood to . be Adebolajo’s partner, and her sister, Danielle, 31, were also . arrested last week but subsequently released.

"More than 80 children have suffered appalling abuse after being branded as witches in a crimewave fuelled by medieval beliefs imported from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. The scale of the problem – with many youngsters being beaten, starved and kept in cages – was revealed as a football coach was found guilty of torturing a boy to death. Eric Bikubi, 28, faces life in prison after murdering 15-year-old Kristy Bamu in a four-day orgy of almost unimaginable violence. WARNING: Graphic images below . Victim: 15-year-old Kristy Bamu, pictured left with a friend, suffered 130 injuries after being hit with an arsenal of weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles . Shocking: This was the squalid and bloodstained scene police were confronted by when they discovered the killing of Kristy Bamu by his sister and her partner in Newham, east London . Guilty: Magalie Bamu, left, and her partner Eric Bikubi, right, spent three days attack Kristy before he slipped under the water in a bath and died . Scene of the crime: Kristy was forced to pray for deliverance for four days and deprived of food and water . Eric Bikubi is facing a potential life sentence following the guilty verdict . Over the past decade, Scotland Yard has . recorded 83 cases of children suffering barbaric treatment, including . bizarre exorcism rituals. But detectives fear there may be hundreds of . other young victims. Bikubi was in the grip of a lifetime obsession with kindoki, or . witchcraft, and believed he had special powers to detect evil. His . girlfriend, former Marks & Spencer worker Magalie Bamu, 29, the . victim’s eldest sister, was also convicted of murder at the Old Bailey. Kristy suffered 130 injuries as he was attacked with weapons including a . metal bar, hammer, chisel, pliers and even heavy ceramic floor tiles. He drowned in a bath on Christmas Day 2010 in front of his four . terrified siblings as Bikubi hosed them down with freezing water in an . abhorrent ‘cleansing’ ritual. The murder took place just nine days after a woman disembowelled her . four-year-old daughter as a sacrifice because she believed the child was . possessed. Shayma Ali, who was later detained indefinitely in a mental hospital, . was obsessed with evil spirits and had removed all the eyes from the . little girl’s toys. Both cases, which took place just a few miles apart in East London, . shocked detectives. They warned the number of cases linked to witchcraft . is growing but the beliefs behind them remain little understood. In court: Kelly Bamu, pictured on the witness stand, said Kristy asked for forgiveness. 'He asked again and again,' she said, adding 'Magalie did absolutely nothing. She didn't give a damn' Terrible death: Kristy's last words were 'I just want to die now' before he slipped underneath the water in the bath . Officials suspect grotesque acts continue to thrive behind closed doors, . fuelled by a toxic combination of extreme evangelical Christianity and . traditional beliefs. In some of the most serious cases police suspect children may have been . sent to their native countries where they face torture, sexual abuse and . even murder. Scotland Yard is overhauling its specialist religious and cultural abuse . unit, Project Violet, to better focus on the dark practices. Senior . officers are worried the abuse has slipped down the agenda since the . death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie in 2000 at the hands of her . aunt who branded her a witch. Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe said the crimes were almost . certainly ‘far more prevalent’ than official figures suggest. He said: . ‘Children have been physically beaten and forced to drink unknown . liquids in rituals to rid them of evil spirits. They have been starved . or deprived of sleep. They have had liquids poured on their genitals and . been murdered.’ Kristy was killed as a Christmas trip with his two sisters and two . brothers, aged between 11 and 22, from their home in Paris, descended . into a nightmare. The siblings stayed with Bikubi and Bamu at an eighth-floor  council . flat in Manor Park, East London, which the pair had recently moved . into. Violent evidence: Kristy Bamu suffered 130 injuries after being tortured for four days with weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles . Witchcraft: These weapons were found at the scene in what officers called an 'unprecedented scenario' Evidence: Officers found a whole array of weapons in the flat, including pliers, a pole, and a piece of wood . The horror for the family began when Bikubi unleashed a prolonged attack . after Kristy wet himself, an act linked by some to witchcraft. The heavily-built sportsman accused the teenager of trying to control . another child in the house and of orchestrating a series of unlucky . events. Four days of abuse: Items found in the flat had been used as 'weapons of torture' He punched, kicked and headbutted his victim before beating him with a . metal weight-lifting bar ‘as hard as he could’ and knocking out his . teeth with a hammer. In one act of savage cruelty, as Kristy’s siblings . were hit, forced to join in and help clear the blood, Bamu ripped apart . one of his ears with a pair of pliers. Five hours of desperate phone calls were made to Kristy’s parents in . Paris but at first they did not believe their children and were then . unable to travel because of the Christmas break. On Christmas Day, with his face beaten to a barely recognisable pulp, . Kristy was thrown into a bath. His last words were ‘I just want to die . now’ before slipping underneath the water. Bikubi, an unemployed failed . football agent, said his ‘battle against witchcraft’ began in earnest . when he travelled to Britain to escape civil war in his native Congo . aged seven or eight. His defence team argued he was suffering a mental disorder, but an . expert told the court he was ‘calm, lucid and rational’ when he murdered . Kristy. Speaking after the trial, the victim’s father said Bikubi . showed less compassion to his son than a butcher would show a cow in an . abattoir. Mr Bamu said: ‘I had so much pain in my heart that I can’t . express it.’ Bikubi and Bamu will be sentenced on Monday. Christian fundamentalist pastors in Britain are fuelling the belief in witchcraft, experts warned yesterday. Dr Richard Hoskins, a police adviser, said he has spoken to many immigrant Londoners gripped by the potential power of malicious ‘spirits’ threatening to damage their families. Traditional methods of exorcism include wearing a charm, fasting or sacrificing an animal and are controlled by the Church. The university lecturer warned that Christian extremists and evangelists have begun taking advantage of vulnerable families and perpetuating beliefs in witchcraft by offering expensive ‘deliverance services’. Dr Hoskins said: ‘What seems to happen is that there is this dislocation and, in this case, something feral and wild. It is completely out of control.’ The issue was first highlighted by the case of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie in 2000. Victoria, who travelled to Britain from the Ivory Coast, died at the hands of her aunt and her boyfriend after being branded a witch. A year later the torso of a Nigerian boy, named Adam by police, was found in the Thames after he was ritually sacrificed. Police believe he may have been killed by someone with a terminal illness who believed his murder would save them. In 2005, three people were convicted of beating, cutting and rubbing chilli peppers in the eyes of an eight-year-old Angolan girl to ‘beat the devil out of her’.

"Roberto Martinez has been left scratching his head by Everton's pre-season form but one shining ray of light has been the emergence of 19-year-old striker Chris Long. Everton's manager is not afraid to give youth its chance and, in Long, he feels there is a young man who could become the latest distinguished graduate from the club's thriving Academy. Sportsmail's Dominic King discusses the youngster's upbringing and assesses his chances of making a first team impact next season. VIDEO Scroll down for Chris Long and Everton youth teammates in changing room banter . Faith: Everton manager Roberto Martinez is not afraid to give the club's young players a chance to shine . So he's made significant strides this summer? Yes. That was abundantly clear on Sunday in Germany against Bundesliga side Paderborn, when he scored Everton's only goal in a 3-1 defeat. It was a thumping effort, too. After collecting a pass from Leighton Baines, he dragged the ball away from his marker before crashing a curling, right-footed drive that sped into the net. It was a strike reminiscent of some from Everton's first team coach, Duncan Ferguson. Does he have a chance of starting the season then? Well, Martinez was certainly enthusiastic about how he has coped with being in the first team environment and believes he is 'pushing' to be included. Given that there are fitness issues concerning Romelu Lukaku, Kevin Mirallas and Arouna Kone, there is every reason to think that he could feature in the party that travels to the King Power Stadium on Saturday. Back of the net: Chris Long opens the scoring for Everton against Paderborn in a pre-season friendly . Instant impact: Long runs to celebrate his goal with veteran midfielder Gareth Barry . How long has he been at Everton? All his life. He first set foot in the club's Academy 14 years ago when he was just 5. He has stood out in recent years thanks to his speed, composure and agility. He has represented Everton at all age-groups, signed his first professional contract in July 2013 and has played for England at U-16, U-17, U-18 and U-20 level. He also had a brief loan spell at MK Dons last season, scoring once in four appearances. Everton pride themselves on producing good, young players, don't they? With good reason. Long – who bases his game on former England striker Michael Owen – is not much younger than Ross Barkley and John Stones and he went to the Under-20 World Cup, which was staged in Turkey last summer, with those two. If he makes the anticipated progress, he one day could be tied down to a long-term contract and be part of the future Martinez is building for the club. Homegrown: Long joined Everton's academy at the age of five and has represented England at Under 20 level . In the frame: Long could make Everton's squad for their opening Premier League game against Leicester City . What has he made of the big change? As you can imagine, Long has embraced the extra responsibility, saying: 'I've loved being with the first-team for the last two months. I was with the Under-21s for a week in pre-season and then the gaffer told me I was going to be with them. I've taken it in my stride and I'm loving it.'","Long scored in Everton's 3-1 friendly defeat to Paderborn in Germany .

"Tom Daley has backed the next generation of English divers to follow in his golden wake, picking out ‘mini me’ Matt Dixon as a special talent to keep an eye on. Daley, 20, took gold on Saturday in the 10m platform, an event where Dixon, 14, came a creditable ninth. ‘It was one of the highlights of my life,’ said Dixon. ‘Tom has helped me a lot from a young age, he’s great.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Glasgow a 'stand-out Games' - Hooper .

Both are from Plymouth, both showed precocious talent before they entered their teens and both, Daley insists, can earn further glory for Britain. ‘British diving is in a very strong place,’ said Daley. ‘We topped the medal table in diving here. We got 10 medals, the most we have ever won in a Commonwealth Games. Four of them were gold. ‘It just goes to show the legacy of London 2012 and hopefully the legacy of Glasgow 2014 will be to see even more people involved in the next 10 years. There are a lot young people in the team who I can help. ‘There is Matthew, who’s 14 and probably even looks younger than he is! I was 14 when I competed in Beijing so it shows young people do come through and that diving is becoming a younger and younger sport. ‘I’m getting old! I’ve been on the circuit since I was 12 and been doing senior competitions for eight years, which is a ridiculously long time.’ Daley’s medal set now includes three Commonwealth golds — two from Delhi — two European golds, world gold and Olympic bronze. Daley insists the 2016 Olympics in Rio are his  priority. ‘That’s my main aim,’ he added. ‘I’ve heard rumours about retirement and they’re just not true.’ Young prospect: Daley has tipped Matt Dixon to be a future diving star for Team GB .

"It's not only the start of the new school term this week, it's also the first year in which children as young as five will be taught the new computing curriculum. The updated curriculum has been designed to put a stronger emphasis on 'essay writing, problem-solving, mathematical modelling and computer programming' - and primary school children will be taught how to code. Network operator O2 has created an interactive quiz to test your computing skills, and see if you could handle the latest education changes. Test your knowledge below with the interactive quiz . Computing will teach pupils how to write code. This is compulsory for the first time. Pupils aged five to seven (Key Stage One) will be expected to 'understand what algorithms are' and to 'create and debug simple programs'. By secondary school, children will have to 'design, use and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems'. In secondary school, they will learn coding languages, which is hoped will better equip them for future jobs. But while the children themselves might be apprehensive, parents have voiced their concerns about not be able to help out with homework. A survey has revealed a quarter of parents would struggle to complete tasks expected of five-year-olds under the new curriculum. This term, children as young as five will be taught to write and test basic computer programs, while secondary school pupils will learn computer coding languages. As primary and secondary school teachers prepare to teach the new curriculum from this week, an investigation by O2 has revealed that many parents don’t feel informed or prepared for the changes. Of the 2,000 parents polled by O2, almost two thirds didn’t know about the radical changes to the computing curriculum and one third admitted they are worried they won’t be able to adequately support their children with their computing homework. When tested against the new computing curriculum, a significant number of parents admitted they didn’t think they could complete tasks expected of five-year-olds. The curriculum has been designed to equip children as young as five with essential skills to success in the digital age in the hope that Britain will produce more tech entrepreneurs in the future. School children might be putting on their same old uniform, but it’s all change in the classroom, as pupils will learn an ambitious new computing curriculum (illustrated). Parents are apprehensive as many think they do not have the knowledge to help children with their homework . This term, children as young as five will be taught to write and test basic computer programs, while secondary school pupils will learn computer coding languages, such as Javascript (illustrated) Another study by Ocado Technology – the firm behind the online shopping company – claims that half of five to 11-year-olds are aware of the computing challenges that lie ahead. And just over a quarter of the 1,000 children surveyed say they already have some coding skills. However, despite their enthusiasm, most children would rather be actors or footballers than computer programmers. Six in ten girls would rather take to the stage compared with 20 per cent who would rather sit in front of a computer as adults. Almost half of boys would rather play football professionally, while just over a third have set their sights on becoming programmers. The company has teamed up with 14-year-old game designer Amy Mather to produce coding tools for teachers called Rapid Router to teach children the basic principles of programming. The survey found that three quarters of parents are keen to learn to code and said they wish they had learned the skill at school because it would have given them better career prospects. ‘Teaching children to program is not just about nurturing the next generation of software engineers; being able to write code is a transformative and disruptive meta-skill that needs to be seen as being of huge potential value whatever your future holds,’ said Paul Clarke, Director of Technology at Ocado. Almost two thirds of parents admitted they don’t understand what an algorithm is, and a third say they can’t use technology to create, share or store digital content. However, the survey did find that three quarters of parents polled said they want to boost their own digital skills so they can help their children. ‘A new computing curriculum fit for the 21st century is a step in the right direction for young people. Much is already being done across the UK to nurture young talent, but a greater emphasis must be applied to the support network to allow them to put their digital expertise to practical use,’ said Ronan Dunne, CEO at O2. ‘Simply put, more needs to be done to help parents get to grips with the fast-changing world of digital technology. What’s clear from the research is that many parents are crying out for a helping hand.’ O2 is gradually launching digital workshops called Guru Bytes across 100 of its stores to give people advice on making the most of new technology. They will cover key topics included in the computer curriculum, such as staying safe online and using the internet effectively. Claire Lilley, Head of Online Safety at the NSPCC, said: ‘For children and young people, the Internet is part of everyday life, rather than being a separate online world. It is crucial that parents are involved right from the start of their children’s digital journey and feel confident about guiding and protecting them as their online footprint grows into their teenage years. ‘We know some parents would like and need help getting to grips with the latest technology and digital environment, and we’re proud to have helped O2 to develop their Guru Bytes workshops launching in communities across the UK from this September.’ Of the 2,000 parents polled by O2, almost two thirds didn’t know about the radical changes to the computing curriculum and one third admitted they are worried they won’t be able to adequately support their children with their computing homework (illustrated with a stock image)","O2 has devised an interactive quiz to test your computer skills .

"So, here we are in Abu Dhabi for the final round of this season’s championship and it is an extremely exciting moment for my career. I am fighting for the Formula One World Championship at the last race, I have a good chance to win, and this is what I have been working towards for all of the years since I began my racing life as a small child. Fortunately, it doesn’t feel as though it is the ultimate moment of my lifetime so far, which is good. Instead it feels like just another race. Of course, it will be very intense but I have a fantastic opportunity to win and I am raring to go. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg preview the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . I arrive at the final round of the Formula One championship battling Lewis Hamilton for this year's title . My team-mate Lewis Hamilton leads the championship, but he has been making some mistakes recently . Nico Rosberg is pictured offering his hand to Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in the press conference . 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. In terms of preparing for this deciding race, I have done all I possibly can. I went to the Mercedes factory last Friday and practised driving the Yas Marina Circuit on the simulator. I also debriefed with my engineers to learn as much as I could from the last race in Brazil. Qualifying has obviously been a strong suit for me this year  but I have had to work on my racing, and I was delighted that in Interlagos I took a huge step forward. I dominated the entire weekend. I was fastest in every practice session, secured pole and then won the race ahead of my team-mate Lewis Hamilton which leaves me 17 points behind him in the race for the championship. I know that I must carry that form through to this weekend's race in Abu Dhabi. It goes without saying that I need some help from Lewis to clinch the title, and I am going to try and put as much pressure on him as I can. He has been making some mistakes recently, he spun in Brazil for instance, so maybe there is a chance that he will help me out and that is what I am looking for. I am going to try to push him as hard as I can to get him to make a mistake. It was a massive challenge for me to have Lewis stuck to my gearbox for the entire race in Brazil. I couldn’t afford to make a single error so I tried to control the pace of the race, not go to my absolute limit to avoid mistakes, but at the same time I needed to be quick enough so he could not overtake. I really found that balance in Interlagos and I was extremely happy about that because I didn’t manage to do it at the previous race in Austin. But now we are in Abu Dhabi and I am looking forward to the weekend. My wife Vivian is here to support me which is great and I have some friends coming along, too so it is going to be very nice to have all their backing. I had team-mate Lewis Hamilton on my gearbox throughout the race in Brazil but held him off to secure a win . It was great to be back on the top step of the podium last time out at the Brazilian Grand Prix . What has been very special is the amount of support I have received via text messages and on social media. The support has been so huge which I am using as a motivational tool. It comes from everywhere around the world, including England, and it is fantastic and it makes me very, very happy so I want to thank everyone for that. I would also like to pay tribute to my team. For the whole year they have allowed Lewis and I to fight it out which is great and probably not necessarily what everyone expected. We have both enjoyed a proper battle on the track and hopefully created some memorable moments for the fans – that is what is important for our sport. As a team we have been so dominant this season so it has been important for both Lewis and I to do the business on track and up until now it has worked out really well. Let’s hope we have a good final race. Here I am on the red carpet with my wife Vivian, and later on in the evening after receiving my Bambi award . In my opinion Lang Lang (centre) is one of the world's best pianists. He loves his motor racing, too . Miroslav Klose is a legend for Germany and it was a privilege to meet him at the awards ceremony . Earlier this week, I received a German Oscar, also known as a Bambi award, for the best athlete and for my sporting achievements in Germany this year. It was a really proud moment. I took to the stage just after the national team who won the World Cup earlier this year and it was an awesome feeling. I met Miroslav Klose and Bastian Schweinsteiger, who are both a great inspiration for me. U2 were there and the best pianist in the world Lang Lang, too, both with great performances. They were incredibly passionate and Lang is really in to his motor racing. After so many years of performing at the highest level they were still incredibly in to what they do and I am able to take and learn a lot from that. Finally, I would like to thank MailOnline for allowing me to write a column this year and also a special thanks to all the readers who have been with us throughout the season. I hope you’ve had as much fun reading it as I have writing it. I also hope that the money we have been able to donate to the Grand Prix Mechanics’ Trust will help the families of those people who have made such a great contribution to our sport over so many years.

"New England Patriots vs Seattle Seahawks . University of Phoenix Stadium . Glendale, Arizona . Sunday 1 February - 11.30pm GMT . The way that the NFL builds a city around an American football event is phenomenal. I was speaking to a couple of British journalists this week who were saying that this was the first time that they had been out to America for the Super Bowl. They just can’t believe how the whole city has become engulfed by the NFL and the Super Bowl. The commercial investment that has been put into the game is huge. I know there are a lot of cultural differences and we are very different to the Americans in the way we see sport, but imagine if we could make a bigger spectacle out of the FA Cup final. Even if it’s just getting players at a press conference or giving fans access to players to be able to see them in the build-up to the final, that’s a small step that I think would make a massive difference. Opening the game up to the fans and letting the fans have some access to maybe a practice or a meet and greet would make the event more personal. The state of Arizona will host Super Bowl 49  between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks . The University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale is all quiet leading up to the blockbuster event . Recording artist Calvin Harris performs on stage during a festival organised just next to the stadium . Around 100,000 people attended the festival on Thursday as they enjoyed Super Bowl week . What I’ve witnessed this week is mind-blowing. In downtown Phoenix it is like a walking Hall of Fame. There are players from every generation of the game walking around just soaking up the atmosphere. It would make a huge difference to the FA Cup final if we started to consider how we could market it and make it a bigger event, not necessarily on this scale. We went to an event on Thursday when Calvin Harris was DJing and they literally built V Festival next door to the stadium. There were around 100,000 people there - it was that big. Even though it was raining it had that festival atmosphere. It’s that kind of commercial investment that makes a massive difference. They were all student-looking types at the festival, but it is all part of the Super Bowl and based around that. You might not be a football fan, but you’ll still enjoy the activities provided by these big corporate companies because they’re in town for the Super Bowl. Katy Perry will perform during the half-time show on Sunday night at the University of Phoenix Stadium . The Californian singer brought her dog to a press conference this week as she addressed the media . Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana (right) at an event in Phoenix on Thursday . Actor Nick Cannon (left) and rapper Nelly (right) perform at a Playboy Party during Super Bowl weekend . There are parties everywhere with all the big-names like Rihanna, Snoop Dogg and Jason Derulo. And obviously you can’t help but avoid all the chicken wings, the loaded potato skins and the pitchers of ale flying around. If we could maybe bring the people of the Football Association and Premier League over and just show them what the Americans do, we might be able to start to do something like this at home. SHUT DOWN THE OUTSIDE RUN . There are a lot of aspects to this game that are very similar to last year. Once again we have got the very young Russell Wilson, playing in his second Super Bowl on the bounce, going up against one of the grand masters of the game in Tom Brady, who is making his sixth Super Bowl appearance and won three already. I would argue that Brady is probably the best quarterback to play the game. Everybody knows how good the Seattle Seahawks are on offense. The key for the Patriots defense is containing the read option (where the quarterback has the option of giving the ball to the running back or instead holding onto it and running around the outside). If the Patriots can shut down the outside run and read option then they have got a real chance of containing the Seahawks offense. The Seattle Seahawks defense is without doubt one of the best defensive groups we have seen in recent times. The ‘Legion of Boom’ are the best group of defensive backs in the NFL. They are very talented, very quick and all quite tall. It is quite intimidating for wide receivers of the opposing team to see. The Seahawks defensive backs don’t show many different looks in their defensive formation, but they’re so quick and so fast in closing down opposing teams. Tom Brady is preparing to play in his sixth Super Bowl having won three titles already . Brady and his Patriots team-mates practice in Tempe, Arizona in the lead up to Sunday's showdown . Russell Wilson will play in his second straight Super Bowl having been in the league for just three seasons . I think Brady will struggle because the Seahawks defensive line is very quick. Brady likes to sit in the pocket and is not very mobile. He will stand in the pocket for the longest time until he finds a receiver who is wide open. I think the Seattle Seahawks will focus on that and blitz a lot. They won’t necessarily put a spy on Tom Brady because he doesn’t run, but they’ll use the extra man to blitz. Tight end Rob Gronkowski is going to be one of Brady’s key targets. Against the Colts, the Patriots mixed up the run and the pass. If they can establish the run game on Sunday it will help them when they try and pass, because the Seahawks defense will be leaning towards stopping the run. Pete Carroll used to be head coach of the Patriots before Robert Kraft fired him and that’s when the Belichick era began, so Carroll might have a chip on his shoulder. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski is fitter and healthier this season than he has been for a long time . Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman speaks out during media day in Phoenix . Pete Carroll (left) was sacked as Patriots head coach and replaced by Bill Belichick (right) Wilson led the Seattle Seahawks to a crushing 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos last year in New Jersey . People in town have been saying that if you give Patriots head coach Bill Belichick two weeks to prepare then he is going to come up schemes, plays and formations that the opposing team night not necessarily have seen on film. After last year’s catastrophe of me calling the Denver Broncos to win - and we all know what happened there - I’m going to toe the line on this one. I think it’s going to be a close game and I hope it goes down to the fourth quarter. MARSHAWN'S SILENCE . I have seen Marshawn Lynch’s press conferences and it is quite amusing to sit and watch him and listen to what he hasn’t got to say. We saw commissioner Roger Goodell’s press conference on Friday and he was asked about Lynch. The commissioner is right in saying that we have all got jobs to do and there are some elements to our job that we don’t really like but we have to do them to fulfill the role and our positions. But American football teams have 60 different players, so why keep putting up a guy who doesn’t say anything? We are not going to get anything from him, so put another running back in. Marshawn Lynch has been at the centre of attention this week for what he hasn't said to the media . NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that people have to do parts of their jobs they might not like . VERNON'S FAVOURITE SUPER BOWL MOMENTS . 3. New York Giants 39-20 Denver Broncos - Super Bowl XXI, January 25, 1987 . This was the year I really got into American football and I knew the rules and what to look out for. The sun setting over the iconic Rose Bowl in California made the whole event look beautiful. I remember watching up to the end of the first quarter and had school the next morning. But my mum stayed up and recorded the game on VHS but paused the adverts, because if you didn’t pause the adverts you wouldn’t get the whole game on one tape. That Super Bowl started a period of about 10 years where my mum or dad would pause the adverts to get it all on a VHS video. In that game we saw John Elway and Lawrence Taylor and two iconic teams. That’s one Super Bowl I remember for it’s visual beauty. The iconic Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on the day of Super Bowl XX in 1987 .

Little did I know that the wide receivers coach for the London Warriors, Marvin Allen, was on that squad and he won a Super Bowl ring in that game.

This was the first American game that I ever saw. It was one of the best defenses that had ever played the game. I wasn’t aware at the time, but as I slowly taught myself about the history of the game, I realised that Bears defense was one of the best to play the game. It was also the first time I saw Walter Payton run the football and they had William Perry aka 'The Fridge'. That was the season that made him a household name, even in Britain.

"Susie Wolff has expressed her disappointment at completing only four laps on her full Formula One debut. The 31-year-old Briton became the first female driver to step into an F1 cockpit during a grand prix weekend in more than two decades when she took part in the opening practice session at Silverstone on Friday morning. Out: Williams' Susie Wolff was massively disappointed with the way she retired in the opening practice .

"Andy Murray knew things had changed a week ago when he walked out on Centre Court to the kind of pop star reception not witnessed since the exceptional days of the London 2012 tennis event. If his first week was marked by a series of sublime displays against relatively unthreatening opposition, it was also notable for an unreserved adulation of the defending champion that has taken years to build. Members of One Direction, present last week and expected again here (gasp), might have known the feeling Murray got when he came out to tackle his first opponent, David Goffin. Focused: Andy Murray has performed well in the first week and is confident going into this week . Putting the work in: Murray prepares for his fourth round match on the practice courts . Good feeling: Murray shares a joke with new coach Amelie Mauresmo on Sunday . VIDEO Murray training with Mauresmo . Doubtless on Monday the greeting will be similar, but the challenge will be very different to that offered by the lightweight, diminutive Belgian. The 27 year-old Scot could feel  positively Lilliputian as he walks out alongside South Africa’s Kevin Anderson. The 6ft 8in giant from Johannesburg is the fourth of seven men whom Murray will have to beat between now and next Sunday to successfully defend his title. With the way he has played so far, it is easy to forget that last year’s winner has not reached any final since — the process of returning to his best proving lengthy after back surgery and a change of coach. For now, the temptation has to be resisted of thinking ahead to potentially sumptuous matches later in the week, a possible quarter-final against the coming man Grigor Dimitrov and a semi that would be a repeat of the 2013 final against Novak Djokovic. Anderson is more dangerous than anyone Murray has met in the  previous rounds, even if he looks like he might have got lost on his way to the nearest basketball court. Tall order: Giant South African Kevin Anderson (left) will face Murray on Monday . High society: Anderson returns to Fabio Fognini of Italy in their third round match . He shares something with Murray in that he first got into the game via playing swingball. He graduated to the local junior circuit, where one of his rivals was the prodigiously talented AB de Villiers, now one of the world’s finest cricketers. Anderson left South Africa for three years on the American  college circuit playing for Illinois State, where he was initially known as someone who only pushed the ball gently around and failed to harness his enormous levers. At 28 that has all changed and he is one of the most ferocious ball strikers on the tour, aside from  having the hefty serve you would expect. If a rally lasts more than half-a-dozen shots, he is likely to pull the trigger and try to end it with a death-or-glory winner. When Murray was in the final last year, the genial giant found himself rooting for the home player and accepts that he has to play the  villain when the match starts at around 3pm on Monday. ‘You couldn’t help but hope for Andy last year,’ he admitted. ‘I really enjoy watching Novak play but at this tournament, given the history, Andy had a lot of support, even from other players. ‘Maybe I’ll be the bad guy but I need to try to block that out. Andy has won it now, so I guess there’s no need for him to go on and win two in a row! Star status: Niall Horan (second right) and Liam Payne (third left) of One Direction attend Wimbledon . ‘It will be amazing just to play on Centre Court, not many people in this sport do it. It will be a great experience but I am there to win the match.’ Anderson is a good athlete, to  the point where he was once a promising 800 metres runner. But while he moves well for  someone of his size, he can expect to be dragged all over the court in rallies by Murray, a master manipulator of the tennis ball. Murray’s uncommon eye picks up a big serve early and is a major  factor in why he has compiled such a good record against tall players, whom he teases by keeping the ball sliced low. Anderson’s serve is a weapon, although just below the most devastating in the game. He has delivered 63 aces in three matches so far but been broken six times in 56 service games — and none of his opponents returns as well as Murray. If he keeps his  composure as well as he has so far, Murray should come through. He has enjoyed the experience of being defending champion and was cheerful on Sunday amid the eerie calm of Wimbledon on its traditional rest day. ‘I think after  winning it last year, the pressure of wanting to win definitely was finally released,’ said Murray. ‘Obviously I’m still feeling the pressure and the nerves but this year they are completely different. I like having the nerves and I’m able to use them positively.’ Big time: Murray's celebrity status was boosted by his Wimbledon glory in 2013 . This week is also a huge test for his new coach Amelie Mauresmo, although their relationship has clearly worked well to date. ‘It’s great having Amelie around. She’s a very calm person but also incredibly supportive, so naturally that helps me,’ said Murray. ‘She’s also a great listener and if I have any concerns she’ll listen to them and then we’ll work through them in practice. ‘She has been over to the house a few times but she’s not living with us. It’s quite important to give each other space, particularly during the Grand Slams as you can spend a lot of time together.’ Defeat on Monday would end things abruptly for this fortnight, although it sounds like Murray’s bold appointment of the Frenchwoman is destined to run further.","British No 1 enjoys star status after his 2013 Wimbledon success .

"When Sir Alex Ferguson left Manchester United after 27 years at the helm, he was sure he had left the club in good hands. David Moyes was his personally selected predecessor, and though that didn't work out, he was sure to have approved Louis van Gaal's appointment given his track record. But after a less-than-ideal start for the Dutch boss in charge, despite huge transfer fees being shelled out by United, it's time to look at the damning numbers. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United signing Angel Di Maria's career highlights . Happy times: In Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge Manchester United's win rate was 67 per cent . Disappointing: But Louis van Gaal has struggled so far while David Moyes was sacked last season . New low: United lost 4-0 to MK Dons in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night . We all know about Ferguson's record when it comes to trophies, while his win percentage was also mightily impressive at 67 per cent in 2012/13. But after his departure, that rate has dropped down to 50 per cent with just 29 wins from Moyes (Van Gaal doesn't have one yet), from 58 games. And it's not like United haven't been backed in the transfer market. Chief executive Ed Woodward, who replaced David Gill at the same time as Fergie's departure, has admitted it has been tough to attract big names but has still managed to pay out way beyond what Sir Alex was spending per season. In fact, United have spent £199.1million post-Ferguson. Gustavo Varela (£1.5m), Marouane Fellaini (£27.5m), Juan Mata (£37.1m), Luke Shaw (£30m), Ander Herrera (£29m), Marcos Rojo (£16m) and Angel di Maria (£60m) have all arrived, but there is still a lack of identity in this line-up. The numbers count: United have lost 18 times post-Fergie compared to 10 in 2012/13 . Money spent: United have spent almost £200m in three transfer windows, including Angel di Maria . Gustavo Varela, £1.5m . Marouane Fellaini, £27.5m . Juan Mata, £37.1m . Luke Shaw, £30m . Ander Herrera £29m . Marcos Rojo, £16m . Angel di Maria, £60m . Total £199.1m . United have been craving an authoritative central midfielder for several years, while a dominant centre-back should have been the priority ahead of the 2014/15 season. Di Maria, while an outstanding talent, will not solve United's problems at the back. Players such as Ander Herrera have been brought in to try and improve United's passing game, which suffered last season under Moyes. Their average possession is at 53.79, compared to 56.16 in 2012/13. Meanwhile, it's not just the wins that have dried up but the goals too. In Fergie's final title-winning season United scored 114 goals from 54 games, compared to 96 with Moyes, Van Gaal and even Ryan Giggs at the helm. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page.

"I am not privy to the plans of England’s management, coaches and selectors but to me, our 5-0 defeat in Australia feels like the end of one era and the beginning of a new one. People expected us to win against Australia in the summer and win again this winter. But a combination of them playing extremely well and us playing extremely poorly ensured that even when we did get going, we never kept going long enough. Alastair Cook needed his senior players to stand up. We didn’t do that and the result was that we let ourselves and our supporters down. It was hard not to sympathise with those who held up banners at the end of the series reminding us how far they had travelled and how much they'd paid to watch us. Disappointed: James Anderson can sympathise with fans who felt short-changed by the England Ashes team . Jubilant: The disappointment of the 5-0 whitewash in Australia was in stark contrast to the 3-0 summer win . We shared their pain, believe me. We were just as gutted as they were. That feeling must be at the heart of everything we do to turn things around. It is clear there will be changes - Graeme Swann’s retirement means at least one is enforced - and not one of us can feel safe and secure about our England future. From my perspective, I am determined to prove I still have a part to play. My hunger and desire to take wickets and play in another winning side are as strong as ever. I want a crack at regaining the Ashes next year and playing in the 2015 World Cup as well. Here are my thoughts on some of the main issues: . Watershed moment for Flower and Cook . Alastair is the kind of character who will only grow stronger for this experience. What will have disappointed him more than anything was his performance with the bat. Since he became captain he has been fantastic at leading by example and scoring loads of runs. Throughout his career, whenever he has come up against an obstacle he has cleared it, whether scoring a ton on his Test debut or the loss of form before the previous Ashes that might have cost him his place. I’m sure he and Andy Flower realise this is a watershed but both have been in tricky situations before. Time for a resurrection: Alastair Cook, who averaged just 24.60 in the Ashes loss, and Andy Flower . Then and now: Cook scoring a century on debut in tough conditions in Napur, and walking off the SCG 5-0 down . Those who suggest things may have to get worse before they get better could be right. Some have accused Andy of being too strict in his approach but whatever he has done in past five years has worked and taken us to an amazing place, and there’s nothing to me that says the way he goes about things is wrong or doesn’t work. As for comparison with Australia’s coach Darren Lehmann, one of whose rules is to get someone to tell a joke every day, well we’re quite good at telling jokes to each other without being prompted to do it. If the team looked down on occasions it’s because we were being battered, not because no one told a gag. KP? we’re all fighting for our places . I am not aware of any big issue . behind the scenes. Even when there were a few problems a while back, . I’ve always said that having Kevin Pietersen in the team when he is in . form and playing well makes for a strong England team. But, . after getting mauled 5-0 I don’t think anyone can say they are safe. If . we want to carry on playing Test cricket, we have to go back to our . counties and fight for our places. When he's on: Kevin Pietersen in form means a strong England team - no one is safe after the whitewash . Brave Trott  deserves our respect . As with Jonathan, I was around when Marcus Trescothick suffered his problems in 2006-07 and had to return home. Jonathan has been dealing with the issues for some time and it is tough to see someone struggling like that. We were aware of problems during the summer. To try to battle through when he was in a bad place was brave and he demands huge respect. The most important thing now is that he gets the help he needs. Respect: Jonathan Trott should be commended for his decision and supported in his recovery . Our war of words with the Aussies . It is what the Aussies generally do when they are on top and when they are, it is quite hard to come back. You’ve got to earn the right to sledge and I’ve no complaints about the level of it. I had a drink or two with Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson after the series and we agreed that whatever happens on the field stays there, that it is all part of the heat of the battle and that once it is over it is gone. The fact that we discussed all this over a beer says it all. David . Warner’s comments about Trotty were a different matter. That was . someone messing up off the field, saying things they should not have . said in a public forum. Toe-to-toe: Anderson and Australia captain Michael Clarke clashed in Brisbane but what happens on the field... Code of conduct: Anderson had a beer with Mitchell Johnson (left) and Shane Watson (right) after the series . I don’t know why I struggled . People have said I struggled to swing the new ball but I wasn’t conscious of that myself. We knew that the Kookaburra stops swinging quickly and conditions need to be just right for it to go. I was simply not accurate enough over a long enough period and my third and fourth spells were not up to the standard I set myself. One of the key factors in our success in 2010-11 was the big runs our batsmen made in the first innings. That allowed us to rest. Thirsty work: The Kookaburra doesn't swing for long and England weren't making runs to give bowlers a rest . This time, bowling again in testing climatic conditions sometimes with as little rest as 50 overs was tough and with their batsman having licence to tee off on the back of a healthy first-innings lead they cashed in. One mad theory I can kick into touch is that my work on reverse swing affected my wrist position for conventional swing. They are exactly the same. Graeme's Swann song . What did not help was my great friend Swanny struggling to hit the heights he has occupied for so long. Only he knows how much part was played by his chronic elbow injury. In the past he helped me take so many wickets by drying up runs or creating pressure at the other end. He’ll get criticism from some who think he jumped ship by retiring but in his head he left for the right reasons. It was his decision to make. We’ll miss him... well, maybe not that much! Stepping aside: Anderson's mate Graeme Swann struggling for the first two Tests of the series then retired .","No England player is safe after the 5-0 Ashes whitewash Down Under .

"Germany saw off France in a dramatic World Cup quarter-final to book their place in the final four. It took Mats Hummels just 12 minutes for Joachim Low's men to get going with a precise header that proved enough for Germany to win 1-0. But how did the players get on individually?

Tried to get forward plenty but got little change out of Howedes. Raphael Varane: 5 . Preferred to Laurent Koscielny but so easily out-muscled by Mats Hummels for the opener. Not a great day out. In: Hugo Lloris dives to make a save but couldn't stop Mats Hummels from giving Germany the lead . Backtracking: Lloris could do nothing about Hummels' header and could not captain his side to victory . Mamadou Sakho: 5.5 .

Superb cross to Benzema before break deserved better. Yohan Cabaye: 6 . Withdrawn after 73 minutes of trying - but failing - to control operations in midfield. Lacked support but he's had better days. Beaten: Patrice Evra loses out on a header during France's loss to Germany in the quarter-final . Task: Yohan Cabaye was withdrawn after 73 minutes after trying - but failing - to control the game . Blaise Matuidi: 5.5 . Blessed not to have been suspended for this one but he struggled to impose himself at times in the middle. Paul Pogba: 6.5 . Took it to the Germans with five first-half dribbles but we've already come to expect so much more. For him, a quiet day. Mathieu Valbuena: 6 . He might not make it much higher than the corner flag but he has really raised his game in Brazil. Not enough though. Control: France crashed out of the World Cup in the quarter-finals but Germany make the final four . Heading home: Benzema couldn't find the back of the net, despite his last-gasp effort . Karim Benzema: 6 . Drew back-to-back blanks after a red-hot start to the tournament but had chances to get back on the board here. Couldn't take them. Antoine Griezmann: 5.5 . Could have laid one on a plate for Benzema early on had he steadied himself. Little impact overall. Manager Didier Deschamps: 6 . Like his opposite number, made a change in central defence but it wasn't nearly as successful. Yellow cards: NONE . Gutted: France crashed out of the World Cup at the hands of Germany and will be heading home . Frustrated: France manager Didier Deschamps could do little to lift his team to the World Cup semi-finals . Referee Nestor Pitana (Argentina): 7 . Got two first-half penalty calls spot on.

"Libya's toothless government today admitted it has lost control of capital Tripoli to rampaging Islamic militants running riot across the country. As the country slides deeper into anarchy, former rebels - the very ones who together helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 - are turning their guns on each other in the struggle for command of the country's political agenda as well as its vast oil reserves. The announcement comes a month after senior officials and the elected parliament fled to the remote eastern city of Tobruk as an alliance of armed factions led by forces from the western city of Misrata took control of Tripoli, having expelled a rival group. And today prime minister Abdullah al-Thinni's interim government, which resigned last week, conceded that most apparatus of control in the country's capital have been overrun by the marauding militants. Scroll down for video . Anarchy: Libya is descending into anarchy as former rebels who helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 have turned their guns on each other as they seek to set the country's political agenda and control its vast oil reserves . Overrun: Among the institutions overrun by militants was the U.S. embassy in Tripoli. They said they had entered the compound toward off looters, but pictures showed damage to the building's grounds . 'We announce that most ministries, institutions and state bodies in the capital Tripoli are out of our control,' the government said in a statement late on Sunday. Armed groups had prevented staff from entering some government buildings, it added. The fluid situation in Tripoli has been exacerbated by separate clashes in the eastern port city of Benghazi where Khalifa Haftar, a renegade general from the Libyan army, has declared war on Islamist militants. On Monday, loud explosions and war planes could be heard from the area of the closed airport which Islamist forces have been trying to seize from Haftar's forces allied to the regular army. At least eight soldiers were killed and 40 wounded, medics said. The area is one of the last positions of army special forces after Islamists overran several camps. Residents said the Islamists including Ansar al-Sharia were trying to enter the Benina area home to the airport and airbase. A nearby soccer stadium was also hit. Today's announcement came as Libya's elected parliament, the House of Representatives, asked prime minister Abdullah al-Thinni to form new government tore-establish order. The reappointment of Thinni, a former defence minister and career soldier who has been prime minister since March, sets him the challenge of reasserting government control over a country where many fear a descent into full-scale civil war. Carnage: Last month, senior officials and the elected parliament moved to the remote eastern city of Tobruk as an alliance of armed factions  took control of Tripoli leaving a trail of destruction in their wake, even wrecking planes at the city's airport . 'The House has reappointed Abdullah al-Thinni today as the prime minister, asking him to form a crisis government within a period of time not exceeding two weeks,' a spokesman said. Parliament voted on Monday to task Thinni with forming a streamlined new government, the official news agency Lana reported. He was named to form an 18-member team, down from the outgoing lineup's number of around 30, it said, adding that seven of the new ministers would put together a crisis cabinet. Meanwhile, a rival body, the General National Congress, has named pro-Islamist figure Omar al-Hassi to form a 'salvation government'. Interim authorities have been steadily losing ground to the militias and the Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) mainly Islamist alliance, which seized Tripoli airport on August 22 after weeks of fierce fighting with nationalist rivals. Storming in: A Youtube user posted this video which purportedly shows Islamist militiamen in the residential wing of the abandoned U.S. embassy in Libya's capital, diving off the roof into the on-site swimming pool (below) Control: The government conceded that most of its apparatus of control in the country's capital have been overrun by the marauding militants . All ministries, the state-oil National Oil Corp (NOC) and central bank are located in the capital. The persistent violence has not affected oil production but traders have said ownership of the oil might be subject to legal challenges if the Misrata forces take control of the central bank, where crude revenues are booked. Libya has been locked in a bitter battle for control ever since former leader Muammar Gaddafi (pictured, right) was toppled by a Nato-backed uprising three years ago. The country's transition into democracy has been stifled by the very militant groups who helped Nato wrest the country from Gaddafi's grasp in 2011. Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy. Three years on, the nation is in deadlock between Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) and the  authorities which have  been exiled in their own country, operating from Tobruk, some 900 miles from the capital. Fajr Libya rejects the legitimacy of the elected parliament because it allegedly supported air raids last month - which US officials said were carried out by the United Arab Emirates - against its fighters deployed at the airport before they defeated nationalist militia rivals. Parliament has in turn branded Fajr Libya as terrorists, putting them in the same boat as the Ansar al-Sharia jihadists who control most of second city Benghazi. The insecurity, as well as a lack of investment in upgrading rundown schools, have led to the start of the academic year, due on Sunday, being postponed in Benghazi, Misrata and Tripoli. The new forces controlling Tripoli, some with Islamist leanings, have refused to recognise the Tobruk House of Representatives, which has a strong liberal and federalist presence. They have reconvened the previous parliament, the General National Congress, in which Islamists were strongly represented. Western powers and Libya's neighbours fear the North African country will turn into a failed state as the government lacks the backing of an army or police force to control the various armed groups. Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddafi's ouster. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddafi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army. Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy. It comes after an Islamist-allied militia group said yesterday it had 'secured' a U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli, more than a month after American personnel evacuated from the country over ongoing fighting. Militiamen stormed the residential annex of America's embassy in Tripoli on Sunday, then took the time to give curious journalists in the Libyan capital a tour. The group has taken up residence in the annex just over a month after diplomats fled to Tunisia over fears of mounting violence in the North African nation in recent months. An Associated Press journalist walked through the U.S. Embassy compound Sunday after the Dawn of Libya, an umbrella group for Islamist militias, invited onlookers inside. Windows at the compound had been broken, but it appeared most of the equipment there remained untouched. US Ambassador Deborah Jones, now posted in Malta, said on Twitter that there was no indication the complex had been damaged. An AFP photographer who visited the complex spotted no damage apart from some shrapnel scars on an exterior barbed wire-topped wall. A commander for the Dawn of Libya group said his forces had entered and been in control of the compound since last week and are there to protect it from looters.","Last month, MPs fled to the remote city of Tobruk after Tripoli was overrun .

"Slimline: The Aga City60, promoted by model Daisy . Lowe, is 60cm wide - which means it will fit into a standard kitchen . cabinet space - and costs £4,995 . They used to be the cooker of choice for well-to-do country dwellers. But now Aga are hoping to attract a new generation of city types to their product with a slimmer electric version of their classic cooker. The Aga City60 is half as wide as the traditional oven at just 60cm - meaning it will fit into a standard kitchen cabinet space. And it is also half the price, costing £4,995. The traditional oil fuel has also been replaced by electric, meaning that the oven no longer has to be left on all day in order to cook on it. Instead the baking and roasting oven can be programmed to a specific temperature as with a classic oven, though in the winter it can still be left on all day in order to heat a room. The new unit has two cooking drawers, along with a single hob on top covered with a hood. It is available in two different styles - a slimmed down contemporary version, or with more of the original chunky features. It is available in a range of pastel colours, and is still made from cast iron which cooks the food as it warms up, unlike a traditional cooker which uses heating elements. Chief . executive William McGrath described it as 'an important ingredient to . our growth plans' and said he hopes it will 'grab the attention of new . urban consumers'. The new product has come after it emerged just one in 20 Aga customers now buys the old-fashioned oil-powered models. The Aga has been a cornerstone of rural living for decades but the traditional design is now getting a city twist . The new mini Aga has a traditional and contemporary design and can be customised in a range of colours . Instead, Aga's electrical cookers, which can be controlled with smartphones, now make up almost three quarters of its sales. Agas have been an established part of the British countryside since the first heat-storage cooker was invented in 1922. Nobel . Prize-winning physicist Dr Gustaf Dalén created the first Aga while . confined to his home after a failed experiment left him blind. With two ovens and two large hotplates, the Aga allowed for all types of cooking simultaneously. They began to be manufactured at a factory in Smethwick, West Midlands, and were first sold to the public in 1929. The news came as Aga posted a 3.3 per cent rise in revenue for the first six . months of the year. While the company reported a first-half loss of £300,000, this . was far smaller than the £2.4m loss in the same period last year. Experts put the the spike in sales to the strong housing market in the UK in recent months. Better job security also meant that people were willing to splash out on large purchases such as kitchen appliances, rather than holding on to their money. The British oven has now become a sought-after status . symbol among China’s burgeoning middle-classes . Aga posted a 3.3 per cent rise in revenues for the first six . months of the year. UK sales were up 9.7 per cent . Aga, based in Leamington Spa, said the appetite for the kitchen appliance . was growing, despite uncertainties around interest rates and the . mortgage market. Helal . Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: ‘I . know salaries are not up, but consumer confidence is good. 'If people . are feeling confident that they will hold on to their jobs, it helps . when it comes to forking out quite a bit of money on a high-end cooker.

"Authorities have arrested the parent of the 15-month-old boy who died after being left inside a hot car. John Junek, 40, of Leonardtown appeared in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt for arraignment on Thursday afternoon on a charge of involuntary manslaughter according to an NCIS official. Navy officials say the baby boy was found dead in a vehicle at a naval station in southern Maryland. Fatal fogetfulness: John Junek of Leonardtown, Maryland, left his 15-month-old son in the back of his car at the Naval base where he worked on a hot summer day . Junek showed little emotion  when asked whether he understood his rights. The judge released Junek to the custody of his parents. Junek's attorney said the family wants Junek to live with his parents because it would have been difficult for him to return to his own home after his son's death. His attorney said Junek was devastated and grieving over the death. Public affairs officer Connie Hempel said  that the child was found unresponsive in the back of a vehicle about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday at Naval Air Station Patuxent River. Hempel said emergency workers from the station performed CPR but the boy was pronounced dead at 4:15 p.m. Authorities say the baby was left in the car by Junek, who works on the base. He was arrested and charged in the death after investigators concluded the boy had apparently been in the vehicle for seven hours with temperatures of up to 85 degrees. In a court documents filed Thursday an NCIS investigator said Junek told authorities he was supposed to have dropped off the boy at a daycare center on the base, but failed to do so. The charge sheet also claims that Junek got back into his car twice during the day - and still failed to notice that his young son was sill in the car.

"Members of a small private school community in Pennsylvania are reeling after administrators claimed Monday that one of the school's founders engaged in a 'sexual relationship with a student' in the 1950s. The allegation was published in a letter on the website of the Solebury School, located an hour north of Philadelphia, which in recent months has been conducting investigations into a number of abuse allegations against teachers spanning multiple decades. Thomas Wilschutz, who currently heads the school, wrote that he is 'now ready to confirm' that a co-founder, Robert Shaw, had sexual relations with a student. Shocking: The small community of alumni and students of Solebury was rocked by allegations that its founder engaged in sexual relations with a student . The investigation into child abuse at Solebury began earlier in the year, when administrators brought allegations of abuse between the 1950s to the 1970s to the attention of police and the District Attorney's office of Bucks County, according to the  Courier Times. One former student from Solebury now in her 50s claims that she had sex with a male teacher in the 1970s, when he was in his mid-20s and she was 14, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'I was not raped,' she said, 'but it shouldn't have happened.' The student claims that the school never contacted her to discuss the allegations, though she came forward in the early 2000s. Another female student claims that she was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a Solebury teacher in the 2000s. Through a statement released by her lawyer, Jeff Fritz, she said that the school knew of the 'inappropriate contact' but failed to contact police or other officials. This is not the first time the school has dealt with issues of sexual abuse. In 1997, former theater teacher David . Chadwick was convicted for engaging in a sexual relationship with a . 15-year-old student in 1993. Close quarters: Collaboration and friendship were encouraged between students and teachers at Solebury, a private boarding school on 90 acres in Pennsylvania . The school says it is removing items that 'honor Robert Shaw,' including a portrait that hangs in the dining hall. Shaw passed away in 1982. School officials say that another deceased teacher is among those accused. Shaw was one of four co-founders of Solebury, which opened in 1925 with just four students. The boarding school is located on a 90 acre campus in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Solebury's website says that the mission was 'to start a small school with an informal atmosphere,' where 'friendship between teachers and pupils would be encouraged,' in the words of the school's first headmaster, Doc Washburn. In an earlier letter from July that revealed the allegations to the public, the school acknowledged that the policy of a 'close and collaborative relation' between students and teachers was integral to its mission, but put down the notion it excused sexual contact. 'We will not permit that ideal to be used as a proxy or a justification for an inappropriate sexual relationship between an adult and a student at Solebury School. Not in the past. Not now. Not in the future.'","The allegation of abuse was published in a letter on the Solebury School's website as the school continues an investigation .

"The Department of Health and Human Services will spent an estimated $1.15 billion this year caring for minors in its Undocumented Alien Children (UAC) program, and Senate Democrats said Tuesday that they want to add an additional $1 billion for 2015. The program, part of the agency's Office of Refugee Resettlement, is responsible for the health and welfare of children who cross the U.S. border illegally and arrive without parents. An unprecedented flood of such children has arrived in recent weeks, with leaked photos showing overcrowded holding facilities run by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security. Underage illegal immigrants traveling without family members are held in those makeshift detention centers, three-quarters of which are on military bases, for a maximum of 72 hours while they are processed into the U.S. immigration system and given court dates. FLOOD: Children have raced across the U.S. border since President Obama's 2012 speech announcing that he had relaxed deportation standards for children who were already in the country . HHS says the number of 'unaccompanied alien children' it will serve in 2014 is more than double what it took in last year, but most sober estimates put the number far higher -- at least at 80,000 . After that, HHS takes over, with a dedicated budget for this year of $868 million, according to its most recent budget. A Senate Democratic aide told MailOnline on Tuesday that additional discretionary funds brought the planned total for 2014 to $911.9 million. But HHS's budget, prepared last year, anticipates caring for 60,000 children, not the 80,000 who more recent estimates expect to pour across the border – mostly from Central American countries. Adjusting for that difference, the agency will have to shift additional discretionary dollars into the UAC program, bringing the total to at least $1.2 billion. At least one estimate, appearing in the Washington Examiner, projects a total of 120,000 for fiscal year 2014. In 2011 HHS took custody of 6,775 such children. The number was 13,625 in 2012 and 24,668 in 2013. Despite widespread forecasts of another massive increase past the 60,000 expected for the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30, an HHS spokesperson told MailOnline on Tuesday afternoon that the agency's internal expectations haven't changed. 'We are still using 60K,' he wrote in an email. The spokesperson also referred questions about HHS's budget to the Office of Management and Budget inside the White House; that agency did not respond to emails seeking comment. Senate Democrats, led by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, announced Tuesday that they aim to put an additional $1 billion in play for 2015, bringing the program's planned total to $1.94 billion. That number would correspond to an expectation of more than 200,000 illegal alien children arriving next year. 'This is an emergency situation by any definition,' said Mikulski, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Tuesday. She also referred to the tens of thousands of children swarming into the United States as 'an urgent humanitarian crisis.' Not just adults: Border Patrol agents are apprehending hundreds of illegal immigrant children every day, and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for taking care of them until a suitable adult family member can claim them . Unlike previous waves of illegal immigrants, hardly any of the children pouring across America's southern border are from Mexico; most of the flood is coming from Central America . Mikulski added that her committee foresees that the problem will get worse, providing 'expanded transfer authority to respond to sudden or urgent needs in the future ... to increase shelter capacity and provide critical support services for children in HHS care.' The appropriations committee will take up Mikulski's funding bill on Thursday. Feinstein lined up in favor of the added spending on Tuesday, saying in a statement that 'the recent influx of tens of thousands of children entering the country without their parents has resulted in emergency situations in border states.' 'Federal, state and local officials need increased resources to properly shelter, feed and clothe these children as they work to find solutions to these heartbreaking situations.' In 2013, HHS budgeted just $376 billion to deal with the problem. But that fiscal year began just months after President Barack Obama announced a major immigration law exemption for children who were brought into the U.S. illegally before June 2007. Children in Central America, and their parents, got a garbled message, believing that they could take advantage of a policy shift and enter the United States with impunity. Those who make it to the United States and are captured by border patrol officers get classroom education, mental health and medical services, recreation and other taxpayer-funded services. The Department of Justice is paying for their attorneys. Senate Appropriations Committee chair Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, is putting an extra $1 billion into HHS's budget to care for illegal immigrant children in 2015 . Texas Sen. John Cornyn slammed President Obama on Tuesday for the influx of young illegals: 'These children are being preyed on by drug cartels and human traffickers, and they¿re at high risk of being kidnapped, raped, or even killed' “The average length of stay in the program is . currently near 35 days,' HHS says in published information sheets. 'Of the children served, some 85% are reunified . with their families.' It's unclear how many of those family members are in the United States legally. 'The majority of the youth are cared for through a network of state-licensed ORR-funded care providers.' In a Senate floor speech Tuesday, Texas Republican John Cornyn blamed the White House for creating the problem. 'Sadly, this crisis is directly the result of President Obama's own policies and it involves tens of thousands of young children,' he said. 'These children are being preyed on by . drug cartels and human traffickers, and they’re at high risk of being . kidnapped, raped, or even killed while traveling in this long dangerous . journey to the United States.' 'But sadly, when they arrive here, we still . have no way of guaranteeing their safety because of lack of an adequate . plan to deal with this humanitarian crisis.' Cornyn also slammed the White House for sending mixed signals to countless Third World families, saying that by changing immigration policy unilaterally, 'the president has created an extremely dangerous incentive for children and their parents to cross into the United States.'","The Department of Health and Human Services has a $912 million budget in FY2014 to care for 'Undocumented Alien Children' but underestimated how many minors would flood across the border .

"In Halkidiki, they have a saying – about how the three peninsulas which stretch out below the northern Greek mainland accord with the different stages of a man’s life. The first finger, Kassandra, is bright and bustling, with a busy nightlife. It is said that this is for the man who wants to find himself a woman. The second finger, Sithonia, is best for the man who has won his beloved’s heart and wants a romantic break (or for couples with children). A special sort of haven: The Anthemus Sea Resort is the perfect place for a family holiday . The third finger, dominated by Mount Athos, holds 2,500 Orthodox monks. Women – even female animals - have been banned for nearly 1,000 years. This is for the man whose woman has left him; who is seeking sanctuary, and comfort, in God. Or so they say. That makes my choice fairly straightforward. My son Arthur, nearly two, does not like nightclubs and his mother would be disappointed if we left her at home. That rules out the first two. So Sithonia it is. Our destination is Anthemus Sea, a luxurious resort on the east side of the peninsula, sitting on an idyllic spot of coastline. Despite it being situated on the ‘middle finger’, our greeting is as warm and welcoming as you could hope for, in one of the best locations for a holiday you could imagine. Quiet appeal: According to lore, the Sithonia peninsula caters to the man who has already found domestic bliss . The long, shallow, golden sand beach stretches out into the cool, blue Aegean. The water is immaculately clear, and the only thing on the still horizon is a wooden fishing boat sitting motionless on the sea. Walk 30 metres out from the shore, and the shallows still barely come up to your knees. It is further still until the water creeps above your waist. This little slice of paradise is our home for nearly a week, and ends up being the venue for the most relaxing and enjoyable break we’ve had as a family. It has been a decade since I was in Greece, as a spotty teenager with a backpack and an inter-rail pass hopping around the islands in the south – a much more ‘first finger’ location by the Halkidiki rule. But this landscape is more lush and green than the bare and rocky islands I remember. The hills around the resort are thick with olive trees. We land late on a Monday morning. As we arrive, a stream of cars is coming the other way – locals making their leisurely way back from their holiday homes to the city to start the week. It is barely an hour’s gentle drive from Thessaloniki airport out to the resort. I remember island hopping being a mild chore – with its seemingly constant ferry hops. As well as being more convenient, this part of Greece also benefits from being less crammed with tourists than elsewhere. Developments appear to have been, wisely, limited. One step at a time: Jack and Arthur test the waters on a peninsula where life rarely moves at any great speed . I am told you can spend your time touring ancient orthodox shrines, boating out to deserted beaches or playing golf nearby. But I can claim no credit for intrepidness or adventure. If, like me, you are travelling with young children – in our case, a danger-seeking two-year-old – what you really want is to have everything in the same place, and to move about as little as possible. In this regard, Anthemus Sea is perfectly set up – and, for that matter, extremely good value. Owned and designed by a group of architects, the clever layout makes it feel much smaller than its 200 rooms. The designers clearly thought very carefully about how visitors move around – and it never feels busy or over-booked. Both the paved walkways and grass borders – full of colourful flowers – are immaculately maintained. There are two large pools, one by the beach, another in an inner courtyard set back from the sea. We find ourselves by the beach most mornings. Arthur does not want to go in too far, but paddles happily in the shallows. It helps that there is barely a rock on the sea bed – and that you can see where you are putting your feet on the soft sand. He is far from alone in the water. There are dozens of children enjoying the sea at what is a truly family-friendly site. Anthemus attracts a largely continental European crowd, and we come across only a handful of Brits during our stay. Guests seem to be mostly Germans and Russians. Raising a sail: For those prepared to leave the resort, Neos Marmaras is imbued with small-scale charm . Despite this, the staff speak excellent English, and all the menus and guidance is in English too. After a few days, we start to adjust to the continental timetable, taking a long and leisurely nap in the afternoon while the sun bakes everything in sight. The weather is delightful. Thirty degrees or thereabouts every day, apart from the last, which is slightly cloudy. With so much sun and swimming, Arthur is exhausted half the time, and rewards us by lying in on several days, until half eight – something like manna from heaven for two knackered parents. Our room is large, luxurious and extremely comfortable, and Arthur is particularly taken by the television on the wall above the whirlpool bath. Sliding French doors separate the bedroom from the living room, where Arthur sleeps in the supplied cot bed. If you can stretch to it, go for one of the bigger rooms, which come with their own pool attached – a real treat for the kids. Arthur begins the week on the top step of the flight of steps leading down into the water, refusing to go much further than waist deep. But by the end, with the help of some Peppa Pig armbands, he is adventuring into the middle of the pool and happily hurling in rocks for daddy to retrieve. Meanwhile, mummy enjoys herself on a lounger with a book. If you want more activity than that, you can try organised boules on the sand in the morning, volleyball in the sea in the afternoon, and evening entertainment, including live music, at the beach side bar. There is an excellent kids’ club inside the resort, well attended during the day and evening, and a small playground with swings and a slide. Younger children will not struggle for things to do, although there is less on offer for older children and teenagers. One afternoon, while I am entertaining Arthur, my other half enjoys an excellent massage session in the resort spa, which boasts a sauna and indoor pool. Indeed, in terms of its facilities, Anthemus Sea ticks most boxes. We eat very well, not least at the resort’s Horizon restaurant. And we go for lunch every day at the taverna by the beach, gorging ourselves on grilled octopus, calamari, huge prawns and the rest of the daily catch. One day, we’re handed a glass of Ouzo on the way in, staff offering the only explanation that 'it's Wednesday'.  That is the kind of attitude I could get used to. Indeed Anthemus Sea is a place I could get used to on a permanent basis. Double rooms at the Anthemus Sea Beach Hotel & Spa (www.anthemussea.gr) cost from €184 (£146) in September.","Sithonia is the middle of the three' fingers' which jut from north-east Greece .

"The day of Baroness Thatcher’s funeral did not start well for Sky News’s Tom Parmenter. Early this morning, outside St Paul’s Cathedral, Parmenter buttonholed a seemingly sweet old lady to ask her why she was lined up behind the barriers. Perhaps luckily for him she didn’t reply with, 'I’m queuing for the Marks and Spencer sale up the road and just stopped to see what all the fuss was about.' Scroll down for video . Falling flat: Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield did not fare well covering the Thatcher funeral on This Morning . Red-faced: The day of Baroness Thatcher's funeral did not start well for Sky News's Tom Parmenter, right, when he decided to quiz this elderly lady . Quizzed: The elderly lady fixed the journalist with a Thatcheresque glare and asked if he would have attended the funeral if he was not working, leaving Parmenter stuttering a reply . Embarrassing:  Parmenter almost went green after the lady's questions left him visibly shaken . Screaming: A father and daughter were on The Jeremy Kyle Show shouting obscenities at each other . Instead she told Parmenter that she wanted to witness a large-scale state occasion and to pay her respects to Baroness Thatcher. As he walked away, job done, she called to him, 'Can I ask you a question?' He puffed himself up a little, perhaps expecting to be asked for his autograph. Instead, the not so sweet old lady fixed him with a stern Thatcheresque glare and said, 'If you weren’t doing the job you do, would you have attended this funeral?' 'I was always going to be working today,' Parmenter replied, stopping just short of saying, 'Don’t you know who I am?' 'No,' she said, 'if you weren’t a journalist sent to cover this funeral - would you have turned up to see it?' Contrast: David Dimbleby was interviewing friends of Lady Thatcher on the BBC One coverage . Subdued: Sky News's coverage was on the whole sober and respectful compared to ITV . Poor Parmenter almost went . green. 'Ah, er, well, yes, perhaps, maybe, possibly,' he stuttered, . before tottering away visibly shaken. I . didn’t see him much after that. Perhaps, even now, he’s locked in a . portakabin studio putting the finishing touches to a voodoo doll of a . sweet old lady and hunting for pins. The day didn’t start well for the ITV coverage either. While Sky and the BBC were both putting together excellent but restrained early coverage of the day of Baroness Thatcher’s funeral, ITV was keeping it classy with The Jeremy Kyle Show - 'Who’s my father: the man I called dad or his best friend?' When ITV finally decided to join the Beeb and Sky, they did so fronted by those two titans of serious television, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. They were joined by three D-list ‘experts’ all desperate to tell their story of the day they crossed swords with/once saw at a charity event/made a cup of tea for Baroness Thatcher. All three were awful and boring. Cringe? I still haven’t stopped. Momentous: The ceremony at Margaret Thatcher's funeral involved hundreds of troops . Service: The procession of Lady Thatcher's coffin down the nave of St Paul's Cathedral . Schofield then went on to confirm that he has no future as a commentator for ceremonial state events. Describing the Queen and the Duke Of Edinburgh entering St Paul’s Cathedral, Schofield put on his best respectful voice and intoned, 'The Queen and The Duke Of Edinburgh process to their seats.' Process what to their seats? Didn’t ITV . have Alastair Stewart at St Paul’s for that very purpose? To commentate . professionally? Even Schofield’s old buddy, Gordon the Gopher, might . have done a better job. The BBC, meanwhile, thankfully left the dumbing down to ITV. After the horrors of last year’s Diamond Jubilee coverage, I was half expecting to see Fearne Cotton, amonsgt the crowd, freshly-minted 'Iron Lady - Girl Power - YEAH!' tattoo on forearm, asking random crowd members, 'What did you think of Lord Thatcher, innit?' But no, they made the sensible decision to leave proceedings to David Dimbleby who, before the funeral started, led an interesting and informed debate on Baroness Thatcher’s legacy, replete with anecdotes from the likes of Lord Forsyth and Matthew Parris. Alternative presenter? Even Gordon the Gopher would have done a better job than Schofield . Not up to it? Willoughby did not do much to boost her own reputation as a serious presenter . There was no attempt at offbeat angles or dumb japes. And Dimbleby’s gravitas and good judgment was also notable during the procession and funeral. For the starkest of contrasts, one . only had to watch ITV’s coverage during the reading given by Amanda, . Baroness Thatcher’s granddaughter. Instead of being inside the . cathedral, poor Alastair Stewart was outside interviewing that shameless . old grandstander, Edwina Currie, telling us another story about how . great she is. Poor Stewart looked desolate, marooned outside the main event like a correspondent from a regional newspaper from Ecuador. The BBC and Sky also dealt well with Baroness Thatcher’s naysayers. Dimbleby referred to a ‘confusion of opinion’, while Sky interviewed several dissenters. ITV, by this time, however, had moved onto Loose Women. They were back on safe ground.","Tom Parmenter came off the loser in a stand-off with a 'sweet old lady'

"In space, no one can hear you snore - but that's probably because you're not asleep. Most astronauts suffer serious levels of sleep deprivation that could be putting their lives in danger, a study has revealed. The reasons for this are poorly understood, but the sun rising and setting every 90 minutes when orbiting Earth on the International Space Station (ISS) is thought to be one possible cause. Scroll down for video . Day and night: Astronauts (Mike Hopkins is pictured) living on the International Space Station must contend with the bizarre notion of the sun rising and setting every 90 minutes as they orbit Earth. This, scientists believe, could be one of the reasons for the disturbed sleep patterns observed in the Harvard study . Scientists studied the sleep patterns of 64 astronauts on 80 space shuttle missions and 21 International Space Station (ISS) crew members before, during and after spaceflight. A functioning man-made leaf (pictured, right) that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen, just like natural leaves, has been created by an art graduate. The new material could provide a steady source of oxygen for humans on long missions in space and even help us colonise new planets. Designer Julian Melchiorri claims that the leaves they could be dumped on planets that humans will colonise, as 'real' plants cannot grow in zero gravity. The material is made up of chloroplasts from plant cells that are suspended in a web of silk protein. The protein is extracted from natural silk fibres. They found that on average astronauts get less than six hours sleep a night on orbiting space shuttles and just over six hours on ISS missions. This was despite the American space agency Nasa scheduling 8.5 hours of sleep per night for space-travelling astronauts. Around three-quarters of astronauts also resorted to sleeping pills during spaceflight, raising concerns about the effect the drugs may be having on their performance. Dr Laura Barger, from Harvard Medical School in Boston who led the study reported in the journal The Lancet Neurology, said: 'Sleep deficiency is pervasive among crew members. 'It’s clear that more effective measures are needed to promote adequate sleep in crew members, both during training and spaceflight, as sleep deficiency has been associated with performance decrements in numerous laboratory and field-based studies.' She added: 'The ability for a crew member to optimally perform if awakened from sleep by an emergency alarm may be jeopardised by the use of sleep-promoting pharmaceuticals. Routine use of such medications by crew members operating spacecraft is of particular concern.' Government health guidelines warned patients taking sleeping pills not to engage in hazardous occupations requiring a high degree of mental alertness and co-ordination, Dr Barger pointed out. Scientists also believe that microgravity (water under microgravity conditions, with astronaut Chris Hadfield in the background, pictured) could be causing ISS inhabitants to lose valuable sleep and resort to sleeping pills . 'This consideration is especially important because all crew members on a given mission may be under the influence of a sleep-promoting medication at the same time,' she said. 'In fact, on the four shuttle missions on which all crew members participated, all crew members reported taking sleep-medications on the same night 6 per cent of the time.' With the sun rising and setting every 90 minutes, Earth orbit is known to be non-conducive to sleep. The Apollo astronauts complained that their sleep was interrupted by light, noise and the cooling systems in space suits. But sleep disturbance continues to affect astronauts despite the quiet and dark 'sleep stations' installed on the ISS, leading some scientists to speculate that microgravity itself may be to blame. However the research showed that sleep deficiency began to build up in astronauts long before a mission launch. On . average, crew members enjoyed less than 6.5 hours sleep a night during . training some three months before taking off into space - about half an . hour less than the average American adult. After missions ended however, at least half of the astronauts found they gained a great deal more sleep. Just . 12 per cent of sleep sessions on the space shuttle and 24 per cent on . the ISS lasted seven hours or more, compared with 42 per cent and 50 per . cent after the same crew members had finished their missions. Montana-based scientist Hank Green has revealed all you could ever want to know about microgravity toilets in his latest video. Green explains that astronauts perform numbers one and two using a suction system, and some of the waste is reused on the ISS for life-essential systems. On Earth, we are used to toilet seats about 12 to 28 inches (30 to 45cm) in diameter, but in space astronauts must contend with an opening that’s about four inches (ten centimetres) wide when they do a 'number two'. They use restraints to hold themselves to the seat, which ensures that no waste can escape while they sit down and do their business. To train astronauts to do this, Nasa has a toilet with a camera inside so they can practice positioning themselves correctly when they sit down. ‘The toilet itself works like a vacuum cleaner, using differential air pressure to suck the solid waste away,’ continues Green in the video. The waste is not jettisoned into space, however, and is instead stored on the station to be disposed of on a capsule returning to Earth. Astronauts’ sleep patterns were studied using an actigraph, a device worn on the wrist which records sleep and wake cycles. Researchers also looked at diary entries from astronauts recording alertness and sleep quality. Co-author Dr Charles Czeisler, also from Harvard Medical School, said: 'Future exploration spaceflight missions to the moon, Mars, or beyond will require more effective countermeasures to optimise human performance by promoting sleep during spaceflight. 'These may include modifications to schedules, strategically timed exposure to specific wavelengths of light, and behavioural strategies to ensure adequate sleep, which is essential for maintaining health, performance and safety.' Commenting on the findings in the journal, Dr Mathias Basner from the University of Pennsylvania, US, stressed the need for more research on the effects of space travel on sleep. 'Only four people have consecutively lived and worked for more than one year in space,' he said. 'As such, how sleep and behavioural health will be affected during space exploration is poorly understood. 'Studies of the physiology of sleep stages and the intensity of sleep.. in space are necessary to answer the important question of whether spaceflight reduces the need for sleep and therefore the ability to sleep, or whether it reduces the ability to sleep but not the need for sleep.'","They found that on average astronauts get less than six hours sleep a night on orbiting space shuttles and just over six hours on ISS missions .
This was despite the American space agency Nasa scheduling 8.5 hours of sleep per night for space-travelling astronauts .
Around 75% of astronauts resorted to sleeping pills during spaceflight, raising concerns about .
the effect drugs may be having on their performance ."
"An ex-boyfriend of Tamara Ecclestone spoke of his shock last night after he was arrested over claims he stole ‘sentimental’ jewellery from the heiress and then tried to sell it. Businessman Omar Khyami, 40, whose two-and-a-half year relationship with the wealthy socialite ended in acrimony in 2012, was detained after theft allegations were made to police this week. According to Miss Ecclestone, 29, the items were given to her by her billionaire father Bernie, the Formula One boss. An ex-boyfriend of Tamara Ecclestone - businessman Omar Khyami - spoke of his shock last night after he was arrested over claims he stole 'sentimental' jewellery from the heiress and then tried to sell it. The two are pictured together in May 2012 . She says she went to police after a ‘third party’ contacted her this week, saying jewellery allegedly belonging to her was being offered for sale by her ex-boyfriend. The theft claims follow a recent High Court ruling that Miss Ecclestone was wrong to try to reclaim a £380,000 Lamborghini supercar she gave to Mr Khyami, as a present, when they were dating. She was told to pay more than £20,000 in compensation to two car companies which were prevented from selling the vehicle while the case was ongoing. A judge said that the wrangling over the Lamborghini Aventador had ‘caused everyone far more trouble than it is worth’. Now Miss Ecclestone is at loggerheads with Mr Khyami again over jewellery. The model, who split from Mr Khyami after he cheated on her, says he had no right to have the items. A spokesman for Miss Ecclestone, who married former City stockbroker Jay Rutland last summer, told the Daily Mail last night: ‘On Monday June 9 a concerned third party contacted us regarding jewellery purportedly belonging to Ms Ecclestone that was being sold by Omar Khyami. A spokesman for Miss Ecclestone, who married former City stockbroker Jay Rutland (both pictured, above) last summer, told the Daily Mail last night: 'On Monday June 9 a concerned third party contacted us regarding jewellery purportedly belonging to Ms Ecclestone that was being sold by Omar Khyami' ‘These were sentimental pieces of jewellery, gifted to Tamara by her father. Ms Ecclestone is now assisting police with their inquiries.’ At his flat overlooking Hyde Park, Mr Khyami – who was arrested after agreeing to attend a police station in West London on Wednesday – told the Mail: ‘I haven’t been with Tamara for two years. ‘A lot of the jewellery we had together, she constantly changes her mind on whose it is. I was called by the police and asked to come for questioning about the theft of £8,000 of jewellery. There were no handcuffs – they just said, “Someone has made an allegation and we have to follow it up”. ‘It was only a small piece of jewellery, not a watch or anything. ‘I don’t want to hurt her. It’s two years since we’ve been together and I don’t know what she wants.’ According to Miss Ecclestone, 29, the items were given to her by her billionaire father Bernie, the Formula One boss . The dispute comes five months after the row over the Lamborghini reached the High Court. Miss Ecclestone gave the car to Mr Khyami on his 38th birthday in April 2012, but when they broke up three months later she claimed it belonged to her. Mr Khyami had used the car to secure a loan from a company called Elite Performance Cars Ltd in connection with a white Bentley which he bought Miss Ecclestone for Christmas in 2011. In April 2013, bailiffs acting on behalf of Elite seized the car from a garage where Miss Ecclestone was having it serviced. The firm sold the vehicle to Ansol Trading Ltd, which apparently arranged to sell it on to a buyer in Turkey until the heiress obtained a High Court injunction stopping the sale on the grounds that she had never actually given the Lamborghini to Mr Khyami. Speaking in 2012, after she split from Mr Khyami following her discovery that he had featured in a sex tape, Miss Ecclestone said she did not regret the romance. She said: ‘I did have a lucky escape. Definitely. I don’t regret the relationship, I’m the kind of person who wants to fix people sometimes, and that’s not really a healthy way to be. People have to want to change for themselves.’ In February of last year, another of her former boyfriends was jailed for four years for plotting to blackmail her for £200,000. Derek Rose, 33, who dated her in 2002, was involved in a plot in which it was claimed he was approached to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper. Rose was included in an email mentioning the possibility of discussing ‘a non-release fee’ and signing a confidentiality contract. Southwark Crown Court in London heard that he had dated Miss Ecclestone when she was 17. The blackmail arose from an email sent in November 2011 to her manager after the model had starred in Billion Dollar Girl, a reality TV programme exploring her life as a rich young person. The email claimed Rose had been offered £200,000 to sell his story to a tabloid, despite no newspaper having made such an offer. Asked about Mr Khyami’s arrest, Scotland Yard said last night: ‘On Wednesday June 11, officers arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of the theft of jewellery from an address in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea. ‘The man was taken into custody and since bailed to return on a date in July.’ Today Tamara Ecclestone said in a statement: 'It's incredibly sad that Omar feels that he can offer for sale sentimental items from me, items which he knew were not every day pieces. 'There is no logical reason why he could think that two female pieces of jewellery, one even with my name engraved on it could ever be his. 'I will continue to assist the police in their investigation.' A friend added: ‘We all thought he was out of her life after the trial, it's an ugly reminder of their past relationship. 'These were personal items, priceless gifts from her dad regardless of the value. Tamara was really upset that her dad has had to identify the pieces.’ • We have been informed that the Crown Prosecution Service has decided to discontinue the theft charge brought against Mr Khyami following his arrest.

"Food charities plunged into a row with the Government yesterday after claiming that 20 million free meals were handed out last year to people too poor to buy food. The charities, led by the aid giant Oxfam, said that there was a rise in numbers of desperate people turning to food banks in even the most affluent parts of the country, and that half a million children are living in families that cannot provide ‘a minimally acceptable diet’. But the claims were challenged yesterday after it emerged that more than half of the free meals were not given out to people who cannot afford to eat but to other good causes such as pensioners’ lunch clubs. Revelations: It has emerged that more than half of the free meals from . food charities were not given out to people who cannot afford to eat but to . other good causes such as pensioners' lunch clubs (file picture) Sources close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith have disputed the charities’ figures. 'It is simply not possible to draw conclusions from these unverified figures drawn from disparate sources,’ a spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said. The three charities published a report, Below the Breadline, which said that ‘food banks and food aid charities gave more than 20 million meals last year to people in the UK who could not afford to feed themselves.’ It said this was a 54 per cent increase on the previous year, and that the need for food aid was a result of ‘a perfect storm of changes to the social security system, benefit sanctions, low and stagnant wages, insecure and zero-hours contracts and rising food and energy prices.’ The report, released in the name of Oxfam, Church Action on Poverty, and the Trussell Trust food bank organisation,  said 20,247,042 charity meals were provided in the financial year that ended in April. However critics said the numbers could not be considered to count meals given to people who are unable to afford to feed themselves, because more than half were supplied by a charity called FareShare, which does not feed the hungry, but instead gives food to other charities. FareShare, which was responsible for 12 million of the 20 million meals counted in the Oxfam report, collects unsold food from Sainsbury’s and other supermarkets which would otherwise be destroyed or disposed of, and distributes it to charities that can use it. These include, according to its website, lunch clubs for pensioners, including some run by the Royal British Legion, charities that help vulnerable adults, and women’s refuges. Backlash: Sources close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith have disputed the charities' figures . One example is the Central Street Cookery School, near London’s fashionable Old Street district, where chefs teach families and children how to cook healthy meals. The school’s manager is quoted by FareShare saying: ‘We tried running the classes at a cost of £5 but people said, although they would like to come, they couldn’t afford to. Because of FareShare, we can now open up the workshops at a low cost to low income families.’ Critics of the Oxfam report said such meals are not going to people who are too poor to feed themselves. ‘The largest share comes from FareShare,’ a source close to Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘FareShare redistribute food from supermarkets to around 1300 charities and community groups, which is then used in places such as community cafes, domestic violence refuges and elderly drop-in centres. ‘This supports charities by helping them to keep their costs down while cutting down on food waste - which is clearly very different to provision of emergency food aid through foodbanks.’ Most of the remainder of the meals suppled were 8,218,242 provided by the food bank operator the Trussell Trust. The Trust hands out packages of food to last people three days, which the Oxfam report calculated as nine meals. It is unknown how many people claimed the 900,000 or so packages provided by the Trust, because it counts only the number of food parcels handed out and takes no account of numbers of repeat visits. However figures from one Trust food bank, in Salisbury, suggest that fewer than half its clients visit only once and more than one in five apply for food on more than three occasions in a year. Thus suggests the number of people using its food banks is in fact much lower than 900,000.","Charities said a growing number of people are turning to food banks .

"Novelist Sue Townsend, best known as author of Adrian Mole books, has died at the age of 68 . Sue Townsend, best known as the author of the Adrian Mole books, has died after suffering a stroke at the age of 68. The novelist and playwright, who died at home in Leicester, had various health problems throughout her life and had lost her sight in 2001 after complications from type 1 diabetes. In 2009 she received a new kidney donated by her son Sean, 50 – who was said to be the inspiration behind Adrian Mole – after a two-year wait for a donor. She leaves husband Colin Broadway, son, Sean, and her three other children Daniel, 45, Victoria, 44, and Elizabeth, 37. It emerged today that the prolific author was working on a new Adrian Mole book, with the working title Pandora's Box, a reference to Pandora Braithwaite, Mole's love interest. A spokesman for publisher Penguin said: 'The book was planned for publication in autumn, but we have only seen a few wonderful pages.' It is not yet known if the unfinished work will be published. Family friend and fellow Leicester author Bali Rai broke the news of Townsend's death on Twitter last night after speaking to her family. Mr Rai told The Sun he had spoken to Townsend's son, Danny, who said she died at about 9pm yesterday but would not confirm she had died from a stroke. Mr Rai tweeted: 'Just been informed by her family that my hero, @SueTownsends has passed away. Utterly shocked and saddened. An amazing woman is gone.' He added: 'She was one of our own, and a unique voice in British literature. She will be missed... In an age of plastic idiots, she was a true role model.' Tom Weldon, chief executive of Penguin Random House UK, said: 'Sue Townsend will be remembered as one in a handful of this country's great comic writers. We were so proud to be her publishers. 'She was loved by generations of readers, not only because she made them laugh out loud, but because her view of the world, its inhabitants and their frailties was so generous, life affirming and unique.' Celebrity fans who were influenced by her work paid tribute to the author, led by actor Stephen Mangan, who played Adrian Mole in the TV series. He wrote: 'Greatly upset to hear that Sue Townsend has died. One of the warmest, funniest and wisest people I ever met.’ Scroll down for video . Success: Townsend made a fortune from the multi-million pound copy selling Adrian Mole series of books . Townsend, pictured at home in Leicester in 1985 at the height of her fame, left school at the age of 15 . Born in Leicester in 1946, Townsend left school at the age of 15, married at 18, and by 23 was a single . parent with three children, a biography from her publisher, Penguin, . said. After writing in . secret for 20 years while working as a factory worker, shop assistant . and youth worker, she eventually joined a writers' group at the Phoenix . Theatre in Leicester when she was in her 30s. 'I have never seen a dead body or a female nipple. This is what comes from living in a cul de sac' 'After hearing the disgusting noises from downstairs last night, I have also vowed never to drink alcohol' 'Pandora! / I adore ya / I implore ye / Don't ignore me' 'My . mother wants to move. She wants to sell the house that I have lived in . all my life. She said that we will need more room 'for the baby'. How . stupid can you get? Babies hardly take any space at all. They are only . about 21 inches long' 'Had a note from Mr Cherry asking me when I can resume my paper round.  I sent a note back to say that due to my mother's desertion I am still in a mental state.  This is true.  I wore odd socks yesterday without knowing it.' At 35 she won the Thames Playwright . Award for her play, Womberang, and a year later published the first in . her series about Adrian Mole, which she had begun writing in 1975 while . living on a Leicester housing estate. The Secret Diary Of Adrian Mole aged 13 3/4 was published in 1982, to immediate success.  The diary-style book was written from the point of view of a teenage boy in Leicester who believed himself to be an intellectual. Set in 1981 and 1982, it includes many of the key historic moments of the time, including the Falklands War, the wedding of Lady Diana and Prince Charles, and the birth of Prince William, and was followed by a sequel, The Growing Pains Of Adrian Mole, in 1984. It spawned a . series of eight novels which were translated into 40 languages, went on . to sell 10million copies and made the author a multi-millionaire. The . two books made her the best-selling novelist of the 1980s, and were . followed by six others in the Mole series, including The True . Confessions Of Adrian Albert Mole and most recently Adrian Mole: The . Prostrate Years, in 2009. Much . of Townsend's life was blighted by illness. She had a heart attack in . her 30s and suffered from diabetes for many years, leaving her . registered blind in 2001 and forced to resort to dictating her work. She later wrote: 'Over the course of . one weekend recently, I went three-quarters blind… There was no . treatment, and my best course of action was to buy a pair of very dark . glasses.’ Her publishers, Penguin Books, said Townsend, pictured in 1992, died at home 'surrounded by family' Townsend was a single mother of three children under five by the age of 23, and began writing in her thirties . By 2009, diabetes meant she needed a kidney transplant, and her elder son, Sean, donated one of his. Speaking . in 2012, she said: 'He felt it more than I did. I'm used to having . operations but he'd never been in hospital before. There was never any . hesitation, though. 'I was thrilled he was going to give me his kidney, but also scared for him and truly appreciated it.' In recent years she was left wheelchair-bound, with neuropathy in her limbs, and she suffered a stroke last year. As . well as her Mole books, Townsend also wrote a number of other novels, . including The Queen And I, as well as further plays and two non-fiction . books. Several of her books . were adapted for the stage, while the Mole series were adapted for . radio, television and theatre.  She also wrote monthly columns for Sainsbury's magazine . from 1993 to 2001. Sue Townsend, author of The Secret Diary Of Adrian Mole, has died in Leicester after having a stroke . Alison Steadman as Adrian Mole's mother, Pauline, and Stephen Mangan as the eponymous hero in the TV adaptation of Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years (with canvassing poster of Pandora, played by Helen Baxendale) Townsend was awarded an honorary Masters of Arts from Leicester University and in 2008 was made a Distinguished Honorary Fellow, the highest awards the university can give. She was also an Honorary Doctor of Letters at Loughborough University and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In . 2009 Townsend was given the Honorary Freedom of Leicester, and said: 'I have been a citizen of Leicester for over 62 years, most of . my family and friends live here, so I was delighted when I was . nominated to receive the freedom of the city.' But despite her vast success, Townsend . revealed that the fortune she made from Adrian Mole had not made her happy – and she had given most of it . away. In a candid interview, she once told how she has struggled to . cope with fame. She said the . depression which blighted most of her life was partly caused by a . feeling of a ‘disconnect between me as the writer of Adrian Mole and me . as the person I was’. She added: ‘I felt people were disappointed when they met me. They wanted someone like Barbara Taylor Bradford in furs.’ Author: Townsend, pictured in 1993, worked in a factory and as a shop assistant before she took up writing . 1979: Womberang (play, Soho Poly) 1981: The Ghost Of Daniel Lambert (play, Leicester Haymarket Theatre) 1981: Dayroom ( play, Croydon Warehouse Theatre) 1982: Captain Christmas And The Evil Adults (play, Phoenix Arts Theatre) 1982: Bazaar And Rummage (play, Royal Court Theatre) 1982: The Secret Diary Of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4 . 1983: Groping For Words (play, Croydon Warehouse) 1984: The Growing Pains Of Adrian Mole . 1984: The Great Celestial Cow (play, Royal Court Theatre and tour) 1984: The Secret Diary Of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4 (play, Leicester Phoenix) 1988: Rebuilding Coventry . 1989: The True Confessions Of Adrian Albert Mole . 1989: Disneyland It Ain't (play, Royal Court Theatre Upstairs) 1989: Mr Bevan's Dream: Why Britain Needs Its Welfare State (non-fiction) 1989: Ten Tiny Fingers, Nine Tiny Toes (play, Library Theatre, Manchester) 1991: Adrian Mole: From Minor To Major . 1992: The Queen And I . 1993: Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years . 1994: The Queen And I (play, Vaudeville Theatre and Australian tour) 1997: Ghost Children . 1999: Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years . 2001: Confessions Of A Middle-Aged Woman (non-fiction magazine columns) 2002: Number 10 . 2004: Adrian Mole And The Weapons Of Mass Destruction . 2006: Queen Camilla . 2008: The Lost Diaries Of Adrian Mole .","Townsend was born in Leicester in 1946 and left school at the age of 15 .

"Being told I could never see my toddler grandson again, would make me feel as though my heart had been plucked out of my chest. Yet I have received more than 250 letters from grandparents who are suffering that agony now. They tell me it’s like a living bereavement and they think about their grandchildren every day. The greatest agony they feel is the worry that those children may not know how deeply they are loved and missed. These desperate letters were written to me after I made a film for BBC’s The One Show exposing the misery of grandparents denied access to their grandchildren. Tonight I will be revisiting the subject, for the same programme. Many grandparents suffer the agony of not seeing their grandchildren (picture posed by models) I first met Jane Jackson in January, when I visited the Bristol Grandparents’ Support Group she has set up to help others in this predicament. She has not seen her own granddaughter for seven years. In her home I met a group of dignified older men and women, all of them suffering, many of them in tears, as they talked about their loss. Jane remembers with frightening clarity the seven-year-old grandchild she adores running down the path away from her after a visit, blue eyes shining, ‘a smile as broad as the Earth as she waved goodbye’. That was the last Jane saw of her. Her son had been though a difficult divorce and the girl’s mother wanted to distance herself from her husband’s family. Her decision left Jane and her husband Mark brokenhearted. Why do these rifts happen? Often, as in Jane’s case, it’s the result of a divorce or a family feud. Sometimes it’s simply an incautious word, a tactless remark that leads to a row. Often grandparents tell me they simply have no idea why they have been cut off. Mark Jackson, 65, with wife Jane Jackson 61, at home in Bristol. They have set up a group for grandparents who are denied access to their grandchildren . The most tragic cases occur when one parent dies, and the surviving parent stops contact. Sheila, a grandmother who lives in Swindon, wrote to me: ‘Last year my daughter died of breast cancer aged 40. I had a loving relationship with my grandchildren. My daughter’s wishes were for me and my husband to love and watch out for her children after she died. ‘She feared her husband would stop contact. Unfortunately, she was right. As soon as she died, her husband pushed us out of the children’s lives.’ It is not uncommon for a surviving partner to be so grief-stricken they cannot bear anything that reminds them of their loss — and that may include any contact with the surviving family. ‘My granddaughter, who’s four, is mystified where her mummy and grandparents have gone,’ says Sheila. ‘When my daughter died it was a double loss — you have the loss of your daughter to deal with, and the loss of contact with your grandchildren.’ I remember my beloved 7-year-old grandchild running down my path, waving goodbye. That's the last time I saw her . Jane Jackson . Another grandmother who wrote to me, Julie, has not seen her granddaughter for three years after a family upset that she did not want to repeat in detail. Even her letters and presents to her granddaughter were returned. ‘It hurts so much when I have to ask someone to try to search for a photo on Facebook, which I cling on to as I have nothing else,’ she says. ‘My grandchild will be nine this October and probably doesn’t even remember me. She might well think I am dead. I just want a hug, a cuddle . . . and the ability to share some family history and stories that would be so lovely to pass on to the next generation.’ She wrote of feeling ashamed that she could not keep her family together and of being desperate for even the tiniest scrap of news.Several grandparents who wrote to me have even attempted suicide. Leslie, who lives in Preston, told me her relationship with her son had been strained while he was growing up and when he married he cut off all contact with her. When she heard from friends that he had a baby son, she was desperate to meet her only grandchild. After she sent a note to her son, asking if they could be reconciled, she was visited by the police warning her away from her son and his new family which left her sobbing.  She was so distraught that she attempted to take her own life. Thankfully, she survived and now helps and encourages other grandparents who are also suffering. Leslie keeps a memory box into which she puts little presents to celebrate milestones in her grandson’s life: brightly-wrapped birthday presents, Christmas cards. ‘Last year he was three and so we bought him a Fireman Sam card with a number “3” on it and a Fireman Sam T-shirt, they are all wrapped up in his special box. Three years of love inside the box.’ It can happen to anyone. The wife of one distinguished Professor of Psychology wrote to me: ‘A lot of the time, the grandparents have no idea what the problem is.  It feels like we are just something to be thrown away and forgotten. We are not even important enough to talk to, let  alone have a relationship with. ‘It’s really hard when others show us pictures of their grandchildren. That just stirs it all up. I wish there were some way to get across to the parents not only the pain they are causing the grandparents but what they are doing to their kids.’ There are 14 million grandparents in Britain, according to the UK Grandparents Association . The impact on the grandchildren,  innocent pawns in an adult war, leaves scars. Many of the letters I receive are from adults who were caught up in this as children. Martin, 27, told me he is only just getting to know his grandmother, and still doesn’t understand why conflict has shattered his family. ‘Something happened when I was younger that stopped me from seeing them,’ he said. ‘Neither I, nor my grandparents know what happened. I met my fiancée three years ago and she has allowed me to gain enough confidence to meet them, much to my mother’s displeasure. ‘My grandad was severely ill with cancer and sadly passed away in January. Now I’m living with deep regret that I never really got to know him. The few times I met him were amazing. I am still going to visit my Nana and am so happy that I am finding about my family, I just wish I had done it sooner.’ Michael, 29, was stopped from seeing his grandparents when he was a child. He was never able to discover from his parents what caused the rift. ‘My grandmother died when I was 12. We were not allowed to go to her funeral,’ he says. ‘I remember my grandfather tried the legal route and found he had no rights whatsoever. ‘He died when I was 16 and again we were not allowed to attend the funeral. I remember asking my mum if I could see him before he died. I was not allowed. As a child you are powerless to insist that you see your grandparents.’ Sadly many grandparents do not get to have joyful memories of spending time with their grandchildren (pictures posed by models) What can be done to heal this pain? The law seems inadequate to protect the innocent, be they grandparents or grandchildren. Marjorie, from Bournemouth, says: ‘I’m sad to admit it was my own daughter who, months after a new man entered her life, suddenly cut contact, not only with me but also with her brother. I not only lost a daughter but our granddaughter as well. ‘She refused to partake in professional mediation. Months passed, as grandparents time is not on our side [my husband is in remission from cancer]. Our final attempts were met by our daughter making a claim of harassment against us, this meant we could not phone, email or try to stay in touch. Panic set in! What if they moved? Would our granddaughter forget us? ‘Fearful at never seeing our granddaughter again we decided, without legal representation, to apply to the courts for a contact order. This involved a nine-month ordeal of three court hearings, where we were made to feel we were on trial. ‘We had to prove we had played a large part in our granddaughter’s life. Thankfully, our granddaughter was interviewed and wrote a letter to the judge saying she very much wanted to see us and stay with us again. Eventually, in October 2013 we were granted an order of contact, we were relieved and excited. ‘Alas, we still haven’t seen or spoken with our granddaughter as our daughter is ignoring the order.’ Esther Rantzen explores the issue on The One Show . So even the child’s heartfelt wishes were ignored. There have been discussions about strengthening the law. In France, for instance, the law is clear that every child has the legal right to access to their grandparents. In this country it is a gruelling process and enormously costly, anything from £5,000 to £50,000. But it can achieve miracles.

"Gordon Brown has threatened to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament over Alex Salmond’s ‘lies’ about the NHS. The former Prime Minister said he would make a dramatic return to frontline politics north of the border to tackle the SNP head on. His announcement prompted speculation that the former prime minister – who would be a significant figure compared to the those currently representing Labour in Scotland – might even seek to succeed Mr Salmond as Scotland’s leader. The former Prime Minister, who is still an MP in Westminster, said: ‘I say this to Mr Salmond himself. If he continues to peddle this deception then I will want to join Johann Lamont in fighting him and securing the return of a Labour Government as quickly as possible.’ Scroll down for video . Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown in Kilmarnock, Scotland, today suggested he would stand for the Scottish Parliament if Alex Salmond continued 'lying' about the NHS . Mr Brown said he was prepared to return to frontline politics to fight the SNP in Holyrood, Edinburgh . Mr Brown, who has rarely been seen at . Westminster since losing the 2010 election and resigning as Labour . leader, has  re-emerged to try to revive the faltering No campaign. He . even won praise from his old enemy David Cameron this week for . ‘catalysing’ agreement on a rapid timetable for the devolution of more . powers to the parliament in Holyrood. Mr Brown will be 65 by the time . of the next Scottish parliament elections in 2016. He has insisted he . intends to stand in the General Election next year, but it is still . possible to run in Holyrood elections while remaining an MP at . Westminster. Mr Brown’s surprise threat came as he launched a bid to shore up support for the Union among Scottish pensioners. A Survation poll released last night showed the over 65s were overwhelmingly planning to vote ‘No’ – by 57 per cent to just 36 per cent in favour. Mr Brown said Labour would not devolve Scottish pensions to Edinburgh – because they were safer under the protection of the UK Government. But he said . Mr Salmond’s claim that the NHS was in danger from London were bogus . because the health service was already controlled by Holyrood. Mr Brown also vowed to hand further tax raising powers for the Scottish Government to increase funding for the health service. He added that if Mr Salmond continued to claim that Labour was a threat to the NHS he would stand for office in Scotland. The revelation that Mr Brown was prepared to move his political career to Edinburgh overshadowed his pitch to pensioners to vote against independence. Mr Brown said: ‘The nationalists want you to believe that if an English Prime Minister sought to privatise the NHS in Scotland or cut its budget, Scots would be powerless to prevent this from happening. ‘They want you to believe that the Scottish Parliament is powerless to act to safeguard our NHS. If Mr Brown returned to front-line politics in Holyrood it would mark a dramatic resurrection of his career after leaving Number 10 in 2010 . ‘They want you to conclude that separation is the only answer if you care about the NHS. This is a nationalist deception – a claim that does not stand up to the evidence and that is not supported by the facts. ‘What the nationalists don’t tell you is that the Scottish health service cannot be privatised by Westminster because all decisions about our NHS are made here in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament, created by Labour in 1998, has full control over our health service. ‘What the nationalists also don’t tell you is that they are not powerless to fund the NHS. Under the Scotland Act 1998, they already had the power to raise an extra £1,000 million in tax to help pay for the NHS in Scotland. ‘Had they wanted to use it, the SNP could have raised the Scottish healthcare budget from £12 billion to £13 billion. ‘The Scottish Parliament has all the powers it needs to fund the NHS in Scotland.’ He added: ‘It is time to nail the nationalist lie.’ He said: ‘Do you think that I or anyone else who cares about the NHS would let it be privatised in Scotland or have its funds cut – without a fight? ‘Would we stand back and do nothing without ensuring that there were laws in place to guarantee that the NHS could not be privatised in Scotland or see its funding cut without our permission?’ He also attacked Mr Salmond for rejecting the latest warnings that big businesses would move their headquarters to England in the event of a Yes vote next week. Paraphrasing a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln, he said: ‘I say to Alex Salmond: you can try to dismiss some of the warnings some of the time but you cannot dismiss all of the warnings all of the time.’ But SNP leader Mr Salmond insisted Scotland was on the ‘cusp of making history’ by voting for independence in a week's time. Vowing that Scots ‘will vote Yes’ in seven days' time, he attacked the No camp for being in ‘terminal decline’ the day after the leaders of three main UK parties travelled north of the border in a bid to save the union. Mr Salmond said: ‘Scotland is on the cusp of making history. The eyes of the world are upon Scotland. And what the world is seeing is an articulate, peaceful, energised debate. ‘Scotland will vote Yes next Thursday and they will vote Yes because last minute, cobbled up promises from the No campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the Westminster Government. ‘The No campaign is in terminal decline. In contrast a Yes vote is the opportunity of a lifetime. An opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country.’ The latest Survation poll for the Daily Record puts support for the union at 53 per cent and backing for independence on 47 per cent, when undecided voters are excluded. Last night an unprecedented list of 200 health workers – including porters, nurses, GPs and the country’s top consultants – signed a letter warning that independence is a ‘great risk’ to the NHS. The open letter to the Scottish Dail Mail stated: ‘Patients from Scotland can access the care they need anywhere in the UK. Independence would, at best, put them at the back of the queue.They accused the Yes campaign of peddling lies about the NHS. The Institute of Fiscal Studies today released independent analysis undermining Mr Salmond’s claim that independence was necessary to protect the NHS. The respected economic think tank said health was already a devolved matter. The IFS also revealed that Mr Salmond had spent less on health than the Tories in Westminster. It said: ‘This means the Scottish NHS does not have to make more use of private sector providers just because the English NHS is (and indeed, it hasn’t been). ‘And the Scottish government decides how much money to allocate to the Scottish NHS from the overall block grant it receives from Westminster. To a significant extent then, the future of the Scottish NHS is already in Scottish hands.’ The IFS added: ‘Between 2009-10 and 2015-16 spending on the NHS in England will, on currently announced plans, have risen by about 4 per cent in real terms despite an overall fall of 13 per cent in English departmental spending. ‘Over the same period the vagaries of the Barnett formula mean that Scotland will have had to cut overall public service spending by less – by about 8 per cent rather than 13 per cent. ‘But the Scottish government has chosen to protect the NHS in Scotland slightly less than it has been protected in England. Spending on the NHS in Scotland has fallen by 1 per cent. ‘Scottish Governments in Holyrood have placed less priority on funding the NHS in Scotland (and more on funding other services) than governments in Westminster have for England.’","Former Prime Minister said he would not tolerate SNP 'lies' about the NHS .

"Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 87, is responding to treatment and will be discharged from hospital in Mexico City . Colombian novelist and Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez has been hospitalised in Mexico City with lung and urinary tract infections. The 87-year-old entered the hospital Monday suffering from the infection and from dehydration and is responding to treatment, Mexico's Secretary of Health said in a written statement. 'The patient has responded to treatment. Once he's completed his course of antibiotics his discharge from the hospital will be evaluated,' the statement said. The author's son Gonzalo said there . had been no medical emergency and he expected his father to leave the . hospital early next week. 'He went to a normal room,' the son said. 'He was never in the emergency room.' Garcia Marquez won the Nobel Prize for . literature in 1982, and his books have outsold everything published in . Spanish except the Bible. He has lived in Mexico City for more than three decades, and has limited his public appearances in recent years. He . was feted before the press on his birthday last month by friends and . well-wishers who brought him cake and flowers outside his home in an . exclusive neighbourhood in the south of Mexico City. He did not speak at . the event. Garcia Marquez's friend Elena . Poniatowska, a renowned Mexican journalist and author, said she had last . seen him when he visited her home in November with a bouquet of yellow . roses, a symbol that made frequent appearances in his epic, . hallucinatory novel 'One Hundred Years of Solitude.' 'He looked well,' Mr Poniatowska said. Garcia . Marquez's hospitalisation did not appear related to longstanding . reports about the author's memory problems, which have not been publicly . diagnosed.  A person close to the family said that Garcia Marquez can . carry on with normal life, although he has good days and bad days. The author's son Gonzalo said there had been no medical emergency and he expected his father to leave the hospital, pictured, early next week . Garcia Marquez's extraordinary literary celebrity has drawn comparisons with Mark Twain and Charles Dickens . 'He functions well in daily life,' said the man, who did not want to be quoted by name out of respect for the family's desire to keep the issue out of the spotlight. Garcia Marquez is by many accounts the Spanish language's most popular writer since Miguel de Cervantes in the 17th century. His extraordinary literary celebrity has drawn comparisons with Mark Twain and Charles Dickens. 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' has sold some 50 million copies in more than 25 languages and its 1967 publication was a milestone in a two-decade-long Latin American literature boom. Other contemporary classics by the man with the bushy black eyebrows and white mustache, known to friends as 'Gabo,' include 'Chronicle of a Death Foretold,' 'Love in the Time of Cholera,' 'The General in His Labyrinth"" and 'Autumn of the Patriarch.' Along with writers including Norman Mailer and Tom Wolfe, he was also an early practitioner of literary nonfiction that would become known as New Journalism.","Garcia Marquez, 87, responding to treatment for infection and dehydration .

"Millions of book lovers have  made a pilgrimage to the  Parsonage Museum in Haworth, known around the world as the home of the Bronte sisters. Now, the owner of a modest three-bedroom cottage six miles away aims to rival it  as the ‘true birthplace’ of the famous literary family. The Grade II listed cottage in the West Yorkshire village of Thornton was built in 1802. Literary heritage: The three-bedroom cottage in the West Yorkshire village of Thornton was once home to the Bronte family . Patrick Bronte, his wife Maria and their first two children, Maria and Elizabeth, moved there in 1815 and it is where Charlotte, Emily, Anne and  Branwell were all delivered in front of the fireplace in 1816, 1818, 1820 and 1817 respectively. But five years after making it their home, the family moved to the Parsonage at nearby Haworth – which has claimed the spotlight in the Bronte story ever since. The cottage was shut up for years following the failure of a birthplace museum on the tourist trail.It was let as private rented accommodation until it came back on the market last year. The historical home had been rented . as bedsits to tenants in search of cheap accommodation but the plaques . commemorating the births of the four gifted children outside the faded . front door were barely noticed. New owner Mark de Luca converted the run-down property into a popular tourist attraction complete with cafe . History: Patrick Bronte, his wife Maria and their first two children, Maria and Elizabeth, moved there in 1815. Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell were all delivered in front of the fireplace . Famous residents: Branwell Bronte with sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne in a painting from 1848 . After the last tenants packed their bags the absentee landlord put the property on the market last year. The Bronte birthplace trust was formed by local villagers to save the property and turn it back into a museum again. But this scheme failed after Bradford Council decided it could not afford to buy the property. Amid fears it would be turned back into flats, businessman Mark de Luca and his wife Michelle spotted the near-derelict property believing it to be an unpolished tourism gem. He renovated the home which was suffering from damp and flooding and has turned it into a deli where visitors can look round the Bronte’s private quarters. The cafe is due to open up in May following an extensive renovation. Among other features, visitors will be able to inspect the very hearth where all three sisters were born. It also boasts the writing desk built . into the structure where Patrick Haworth wrote his first sermon - about . the Battle of Waterloo. Birthplace: The drawing room still boasts the fireplace, in front of which Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell were all born . Cosy: The owners' private living room complete with a wardrobe used by the Bronte family . The original desk where Patrick Haworth wrote his first sermon - about the Battle of Waterloo . The new owners, both 29, sold their cottage in the village to buy the Bronte home. They snapped it up as a repossession for £120,000 and then spent another £30,000 doing it up. The couple already had a track record, having converted a Grade II listed building around the corner into a hair salon. But it was cheap because the 100 year old timber windows were rotten, the roof was leaking, and the wallpaper was falling off the walls -which were riddled with rising damp. The old scullery at the rear of the property had flooded through the back door with waste from the overflowing drains. Mr de Luca, a former quantity surveyor, said: ‘It was so damp and humid. The drains were overflowing with years of dirt and debris.’ ‘The property has been mistreated over the years and I wanted to bring tourists back to the village,’ he said. ‘It is a very important property for England and we wanted to reclaim the history and restore the place to its former glory.’ The couple are sleeping in Patrick and Maria’s room complete with the writing desk where he wrote his first sermon – on Wellington’s victory at Waterloo. Businessman Mark de Luca and his wife Michelle bought the house as a repossession for £120,000 and then spent further £30,000 doing it up . Delighted: New Owner Mark de Luca said he wanted to reclaim the history of the property and restore it to its former glory . The second bedroom where the younger Brontes slept has become the drawing room, though it still has the built-in wardrobe used by the children. The third bedroom used by the Bronte children’s nurse serves as a study while the downstairs scullery has become their private kitchen. The rest of the downstairs rooms, including the drawing room with the famous fireplace, have been laid out as a delicatessen and coffee shop with room for 35 people due to open next month. A counter and open kitchen serving cakes, sandwiches, and pastries has been created in one of the front extensions built in the 1900s as a butcher’s shop. The couple hope the trendy décor will attract of a new generation of Bronte fans who previously may have regarded the sisters’ writings as a touch highbrow. Mr de Luca added: ‘We want to make the Brontes cool and trendy. The Bronte Society meetings and events at Haworth seem to attract mainly older people. ‘The original idea of a museum is great - but you do not really get to sit there and enjoy reading a Bronte book or a newspaper.’ Birthplace Trust Chairman Steve Stanworth said: ‘I am delighted. It will  once again be somewhere that Bronte fans can see the actual place the literary giants were brought into the world. ‘It could have been turned into flats - and that would have been a real shame. But Mark spotted a unique selling point for a coffee house. A portrait of Anne, Emily and Charlotte Bronte from 1834. It was painted by their brother Branwell who had originally placed himself among his sisters, but removed his image so as not to clutter the picture . ‘Thornton village needs the recognition as the first stop on any pilgrimage and we hope this helps the regeneration of the village.’ Bronte Society Chairman Sally McDonald said: ‘The birthplace in Thornton is hugely important in the Bronte story. ‘In the bicentenary year of 2016 the world’s attention will turn to all places linked with Charlotte Bronte. ‘Some years ago former Bronte Society member, Barbara Whitehead, bought and tried to restore the house but sadly it proved just too big a project. ‘It is a pity the Birthplace Trust’s hopes of turning the house into a museum were pipped at the post but it wasn’t to be and it is heartening to hear the new owners are keen to sympathetically retain the history.’ Patrick Bronte wrote of his time in Thornton: ‘My happiest days were spent there. ‘This is where the family was complete: father, mother and children, and where they had kind friends.’ In Haworth, he said, he felt like ‘a stranger in a strange land’.","Run down property in Yorkshire village of Thornton bought for £120,000 .

"Thanks to recent tragic anorexia deaths and several high profile campaigns, seeing a scarily skinny model on the catwalk is becoming an increasingly rare event. But while womenswear designers have taken a step in the right direction, it seems the same cannot be said for those behind men's fashion collections. A photo of a shockingly thin male model on the catwalk at YSL was tweeted by blogger Poppy Dinsey, the founder of website What I Wore Today. Gaunt: The extremely thin male model seen on the catwalk during the Yves Saint Laurent show in Paris . Controversy: What I Wore Today founder, Poppy Dinsey, tweeted the photo and caused a Twitter storm . 'Woefully irresponsible model casting at YSL yesterday.' she wrote, before adding: 'Speechless'. The photo of the emaciated model prompted a barrage of responses from other Twitter users, most of whom tweeted their support and horror YSL's use of the gaunt model. But in a disturbing twist, others weighed in in favour of looking extremely thin, with one user - who outs herself as 'pro ana' in her Twitter handle - arguing that despite appearances, Dinsey should have made clear that he 'ISN'T ill'. The woman added: 'Have you thought how he'd feel if he saw this? He has absolutely NOTHING wrong.' 'I have had hundreds of replies but haven't seen a single response that says they think it looks healthy or acceptable, although plenty of fashiony friends enjoyed the collection itself - which people seem to be forgetting about,' said Dinsey. 'What did upset me was the number of people who said the model was 'disgusting' -  I made a point of saying you can't assume that the model has an eating disorder. 'I have been to hundreds of fashion shows so I'm never particularly surprised by the latest 'shock model picture' but casting directors have to take some responsibility. 'A model may well be healthy, but if someone looking at the pictures will assume the opposite, why not cast someone who doesn't create such controversy?' Healthy: The world's highest earning male model, David Gandy, is toned and muscly rather than skinny . Clean living: In equally good shape are fellow male supermodels, Andrés Velencoso (pictured with girlfriend, Kylie Minogue) and Gabriel Aubry (seen here with ex, Halle Berry) The gaunt-faced model is a far cry from the healthy-looking male models who have dominated the industry in recent years. High-earning . male models such as David Gandy, Gabriel Aubry and Andrés Velencoso . have set an industry standard geared towards the fit and healthy rather . than the emaciated. But the appearance of the emaciated model suggests times could be changing and that's worrying - . particularly at a time when male anorexia or 'manorexia' is becoming . more widespread. According to recent figures released . by eating disorders charity, B-EAT, the number of male anorexics, . previously thought to total just 10 per cent of total sufferers, has . shot up. Male sufferers now account for a quarter of all disordered eating cases but often find themselves struggling with the disease alone thanks to a lack of awareness about the disease and how it affects men. 'All too often eating disorders are seen as a young girl’s illness,' says B-EAT spokeswoman, Leanne Thorndyke. 'There is still a great deal of misunderstanding and stigma surrounding these serious psychiatric conditions which makes it even more difficult for a male to admit to having the problem and seeking help.' Much better: Normal sized models on the runway at Lanvin (left) and Paul Smith (right) And, while the sight of models such . as the one seen at YSL aren't directly to blame, according to Thorndyke, . they certainly don't help. 'The fashion industry doesn’t cause . eating disorders. It does, however, have a powerful influence that is . highly toxic to some vulnerable people. 'People have told us these images alone do not cause their eating disorder but it can make it harder for people to recover.' Adds Dinsey: 'It's unfair on the fashion industry to say that all designers are peddling an unhealthy ideal, as the majority of designers and casting directors will be doing their utmost to only book healthy models. 'Catwalk models aren't like your average attractive guy or girl from school - they fit a very narrow ideal of height and weight and some people are just naturally that thin. 'The problem is, impressionable people across the world see these images and aspire to be like this - when it would take nothing short of starvation to achieve the same shape - and that's forgetting they're probably four inches too short to model anyway.' Well, the models look fine...but the clothes . certainly don't! More bizarre fashion on the Paris catwalk at Thom . Browne (left) and Qasimi Homme (right) While Madrid Fashion Week remains the only one to have banned very thin models, the British Fashion Council has taken steps to ensure that model's heath is a priority for London Fashion Week designers and brands alike. The main provisions include: . In addition to the regulations produced by the BFC, Equity, the performing arts union has established a Model section recognising modelling as a  profession on a par with acting and dance. The BFC has also funded an eating disorder awareness seminar for model agencies staff delivered by eating disorders charity, B-EAT.

"NBC has become the centre of a race storm after airing an ad featuring a monkey performing gymnastics, right after showing the performance of Gabby Douglas, the first African-American to win Olympic gold. The network has since apologised for the advert's poor timing, explaining: 'No offense was intended.' The controversy ignited as sportscaster Bob Costas wrapped his analysis of her incredible routine during the all-around competition last night.

The unintentional, but poorly-timed ad was for Animal Practice, an upcoming NBC sitcom. Angry viewers lashed out at the network on social media platforms like Twitter, accusing them of racism. 'Disgusted at NBC for showing Animal Practice with monkey right after Gabby wins her gold,' one user posted. Monkey business: The ad was for the upcoming NBC sitcom Animal Practice . Rage: Angry viewers lashed out at the network on social media platforms like Twitter, accusing them of racism . Another called it 'risky.'

'This spot promoting ’Animal Practice,’ which has run three times previously, is one in a series with an Olympic theme which have been scheduled for maximum exposure. Certainly no offense was intended.' Gabby may be a rising star in gymnastics, but the golden achievement has also brought unwanted attention. The race uproar came after another nasty row involving Twitter over the gymnastics sensation’s hair, expressing their disapproval over how it was styled. Critics have argued that her dark locks should in fact mimic the tight, ballerina-style bun that gymnasts usually tuck their hair into. One user wrote: 'Gabby Douglas gotta [sic] do something with this hair! These clips and this brown gel residue aint it!'. Wowing the crowd: Gabby's gold-medal win on Thursday captivated the nation .

Condoleezza Rice, the first African-American secretary of state. The Capuchin monkey in the ad, named Crystal, is the same primate that appears in We Bought a Zoo, The Hangover Part II and the Night at the Museum films. She also appears in Community, another NBC sitcom. NBC's broadcast of the London games has come under intense scrutiny, which has been exacerbated due to Twitter, which viewers have used as a soap box to gripe about the coverage. It was accused of manufacturing unnecessary suspense for the women's team gymnastics final on Wednesday night- which was arguably not even close. Protests erupted earlier this week following a promo that showed U.S. swimmer Missy Franklin with her gold medal - moments before the network aired the dramatic race in which she won it. In a statement to MailOnline, NBC apologised for the tape delay mistake. Spoiler: Before airing Missy Franklin's gold medal-winning performance, NBC aired a promo for the Today show that showed her with the medal . On Monday night, a Los Angeles-based reporter and vocal critic of the network had his Twitter page suspended. Guy Adams, who writes for The Independent, lost his account after NBC complained he tweeted the email address of NBC Olympics president Gary Zenkel so viewers could 'tell him what you think.' Adams' account was later reinstated. There was also outrage over NBC's decision to cut a tribute for the victims of the London 2005 terrorist bombings from its Olympics Opening Ceremony coverage on Friday. The network said it did not air the tribute because it wasn't tailored for the U.S. audience - and aired a Ryan Seacrest interview with iconic swimmer Michael Phelps instead.

"Honda has revealed its new compact sports utility vehicle — the HR-V — which goes on sale next summer from £16,000. And if you want to see a prototype and place an early order, head for the Paris Motor Show next month. Based on the Jazz hatchback, it's the Japanese giant's answer to the quirky, but successful, Nissan Juke, Peugeot's 2008 and the stylish Renault Captur. Based on the Jazz hatchback, the HR-V is the Japanese giant's answer to the quirky, but successful, Nissan Juke, Peugeot's 2008 and the stylish Renault Captur . It also marks a return of the HR-V name, last used on a Honda nine years ago in 2005 as the baby brother to the larger CR-V. Honda says the 'baby' offroader combines coupe-like design with the versatility and stability of a 4x4. Placing the fuel tank in the middle of the vehicle maximises internal space, while Honda's 'magic seats' offer highly flexible seating. A spokesman said: 'There's a wide range of configurations, with the ability to fold the second row of seats for added cargo space.' Meanwhile, Honda has issued the first details of its new Jazz super-mini, which also makes its European debut at the Paris show. Slightly longer than the car it replaces, it introduces a completely new body shell for the bigselling model. Honda says it will also offer improved fuel economy and higher performance thanks to its new 1.3 litre i-VTEC petrol engine linked to either a six-speed manual (replacing the previous five-speed unit) or an automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT).

It has been developed in conjunction with West Midlands audio firm Connects2. The small device, fitted behind the dashboard, is controlled by an app on the driver's smartphone. Radioplayer boss Michael Hill says: 'The device scans DAB, DAB+, FM, and internet sources, automatically selecting the best platform to deliver any station. If a signal is lost, it switches seamlessly and safely to the same station on another platform.'

"League One side Leyton Orient have pulled off a major coup by agreeing a deal to sign former Liverpool and Sunderland left back Andrea Dossena until the end of the season. Dossena, 33, was a free agent after being released by Gus Poyet's side at the end of last season. The experienced defender made 11 appearances in all competitions for the Mackems last term, but was part of a mass player clear-out conducted by Poyet in the summer.

The left-sided player featured against his former side Liverpool at Anfield last season for Sunderland . The Italian's first spell in England was with Liverpool, spending 18 months with the Reds following a £7million move from Udinese in 2008. Despite having a bit-part role at the club, he remains fondly remembered by the Kop faithful for his goals against both Manchester United and Real Madrid. After leaving the Reds Dossena then spent time at Serie A trio Napoli, Palermo and Torino, before making the move to Wearside last September. Dossena has now linked up with the O's on a short-term deal, and his signing will provide a huge boost to the club, as they find themselves struggling towards the bottom of League One after a disappointing start to the season.","Andrea Dossena was a free agent after leaving Sunderland last season .

"Monkeys in the wild not only love watching videos, but they also tend to copy the behaviour seen on screen, according to a new study. When scientists showed marmosets footage of a monkey opening a box to get a banana, they were able to replicate what they saw and open the box themselves. The study, undertaken in Pernambuco, Brazil, reveals new insights into how monkeys learn from each other in the wild, according to Austrian and Scottish researchers. Scroll down for video . When scientists showed marmosets footage of a monkey opening a box to get a banana, they were able to replicate what they saw and open the box themselves, according to a new study . ‘How-to’ videos have been a success when shown to monkeys in captivity, but this is the first time they were used to train creatures in the wild. Wild marmosets were chosen because they are native to Brazil and very social, curious creatures. The species tend to live in small families in clearly defined territories. They can be fierce creatures if someone disturbs their home. But among themselves, marmosets are close-knit community. The whole family usually raises a child, and infants learn life skills from older group members. Wild marmosets were chosen because they are native to Brazil, and very social, curious creatures. The species tend to live in small families, ranging on average from five to 15 monkeys, in a clearly defined territories. They can be fierce creatures if someone disturbs their home . ‘How-to’ videos have been a success when shown to monkeys in captivity, but this is the first time they were used to train creatures in the wild . Monkeys can use symbols to add, researchers have found. Experts say the discovery could give new insight into the evolutionary origins of our ability to count. The found rhesus monkeys can not only differentiate between symbols but also add the values of two symbols at a time with 90% accuracy. Margaret Livingstone, a neuroscientist at Harvard University Medical School, led the study in the journal PNAS. The team developed a series of tests for rhesus monkeys, which diverged from humans roughly 25 million years ago. Given the choice of two different symbols, the monkeys chose the symbol that represented the larger reward with up to 90% accuracy, suggesting that the monkeys had learned to assign specific values to the 26 distinct abstract symbols. 'The monkeys demonstrated the ability to not only differentiate between the symbols but also to add the values of two symbols at a time,' the researchers wrote. Tina Gunhold at the University of Vienna, Austria, worked with researchers at St Andrews University to film a common marmoset retrieving a banana slice from a plastic device. They then placed a screen in a protective enclosure in the jungle and played the video on loop. The researchers filmed different groups of marmosets as they were drawn to the enclosure and then acted on what they saw. Twelve groups were filmed, 108 marmosets in total, with some of the groups seeing video of marmosets opening the box using the drawer, others lifting the lid. One group was shown a still image. Twelve of the marmosets were able to open the box, 11 of which had seen it done first in a video. One monkey could do it after just seeing the still image. This suggests, compared to monkeys shown a static image, video-watching marmosets were more likely to open the device, typically copying the technique shown. Young monkeys spent more time near the video box than older family members, suggesting that they found the movie more entertaining. Professor Gunhold would now like to set up similar experiments to find out whether monkeys are more likely to watch a dominant group-member.

"The new, futuristic-looking Lexus NX 300h hybrid sports utility vehicle hits Britain's roads this month. More than 800 advance orders have been taken for the mid-sized, compact, petrol-electric crossover, costing from £29,495 for the entry level S version with front-wheel drive and up to £42,995 for the fully loaded, all-wheel-drive Premier trim variant. Five equipment grades are on offer. They're creating a buzz and I've already had people ask whether they should opt to buy one before considering its archrival, the Range Rover Evoque, another radically styled vehicle. The new Lexus features wireless charging for smart phones, a panoramic view monitor, head-up display and blind spot monitor . The Lexus NX will be the first model to feature Lexus's 'pre-crash' safety system and adaptive cruise control as standard. Add wireless charging for smart phones, a panoramic view monitor, head-up display and blind spot monitor and it's quite a package. Standard features of the S include 17in alloy wheels, hill assist control and speed-sensitive automatic door locking. Comfort and gadget levels increase through the trim levels. The flagship Premier includes 18in alloys, Lexus premium navigation, a 360-degree panoramic view, lane-keep assist and heated steering wheel. The NX 200t, with a new 2-litre turbocharged petrol engine, follows next March. If you want your car to yomp ahead of the field in the British Touring Car Championships, what more cunning a plan than to get the Parachute Regiment on your side? Let's face it, who's going to dare overtake you? Premium car firm Infiniti, along with Support Our Paras Racing, this week revealed the vehicle and team that will be entered into next season's Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship. The aim is to raise awareness and funds for Support Our Paras, the regiment's official charity. The team, overseen by principal Derek Palmer, consists of injured paratroopers who'll work on the cars, prepare them for race weekends and maintain them. Long term, the team aims to train injured paratrooper graduates to drive Infiniti race cars. The two Infiniti Q50 cars will be driven by Richard Hawken (Waltonon-Thames) and Derek Palmer Jnr (Lanark/Zurich). Hawken said he was honoured to help: 'These guys put their neck on the line for us every day in their normal duties. When they do get injured, we should all collectively do what we can by way of a personal thank you and contribute to the charity, which helps to give them as normal a life as possible.' The Parachute Regiment lost 26 soldiers in Afghanistan, with more than 130 others wounded. Congestion will cost the average family more than £2,000 a year in lost time and effort as the cumulative burden on the economy tops £300billion over the next 16 years, a new report has revealed. But that'll more than double for families in London — Britain's most congested city — with drivers spending the equivalent of eight extra working weeks a year stuck in cars. The population is set to rise from 64 million to 72 million by 2030. This means gridlock will worsen, resulting in 'a terrible shock' for households, says the report. The study, from satnav data suplier INRIX and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), covered the UK's 18 largest urban areas. Our 63 per cent increase will be the highest among major world economies, and compares to a 50 per cent rise in the U.S. and 31 per cent in Germany and France.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants work permits for foreign footballers to be scrapped. The Frenchman, who revealed he missed out on bringing Angel di Maria to the club nine years ago due to employment red tape, says the UK’s football authorities should open its borders to all overseas players, not just those who qualify for the necessary paperwork. Arsenal are poised to sign Villarreal’s Gabriel Paulista, who has a £15million release clause. But the transfer is reliant on the Brazilian obtaining a work permit, which will not be a foregone conclusion given the central defender has not played international football. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants work permits for foreign footballers to be scrapped . Villarreal's Gabriel Paulista (right) could be heading for Arsenal if they can secure a work permit . Rules state that only players who have played 75 per cent of matches for a nation inside FIFA’s top 70 within the past two years are eligible for work permits. This is to safeguard the progress of academy players into first teams. Arsenal say they will appeal if Paulista cannot join them this month. Next season new rules will see players who cost £10m and over automatically granted a work permit. But Wenger says all work permit regulations should be abandoned, claiming it would help produce more accomplished youngsters. ‘The target of the Premier League, to be the best League in the world,’ said Wenger. ‘So you have to open it completely. ‘We identified Di Maria when he was 17. We wanted him to come here, but he goes to Portugal, from Portugal he goes to Spain. Why? Because he could not get a work permit here. That means you can only get him to England once he is worth a huge amount of money.’ Defender Paulista is yet to make a senior appearance for the Brazilian national side . Wenger revealed he could have signed Angel di Maria nine years ago but he couldn't get a work permit . On the impact abolishing work permit rules would have on academies, Wenger said: ‘We live in a world where artificial protection is negative. If you want to be the best league in the world then you have to accept you have to produce the best players in the world. ‘So the question is, how can you produce the best players? ‘There’s two ways to approach the solution of the academies. You close completely the borders and you play only with English players. What will that do? That will kill the attractiveness of the Premier League and I think that’s not the best way to develop the best players. ‘One thing is for sure: if you put a young player with top level players he has more chance to develop. If you put him with average players he has more chances to remain average. We have to accept that. It’s the same if you have children. You put them in the top class and if they are talented they develop better than if you put them in an average class. Wenger said, that contrary to belief, work permit rules do not help the development of English youngsters . The Gunners recently signed young Polish midfielder Krystian Bielik from Legia Warsaw . ‘At the moment the whole speech is “let’s put them in an average class”. That doesn’t work for the development. So we have to say maybe “let’s put them in the top class and see how we can help them reach that level”. The politically correct speech at the moment is the opposite “let’s protect them and not expose them to world-class competition”. ‘I don’t really understand the logic of the new rule next season,’ added Wenger. ‘What does it mean if he comes into the country anyway just with a huge amount of money. That is the only difference. And who do you pay this huge amount of money to? A club like Real Madrid. They don’t need the money.’ Meanwhile, more doubt has been cast over goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny’s future at the Emirates, with Arsenal keeping tabs on Fiorentina’s Norberto Neto, who is also a target for Liverpool. WHO IS GABRIEL PAULISTA? He’s a 24-year-old Brazilian centre back who plays for Spanish side Villarreal. WHAT TYPE OF PLAYER IS HE? He’s a very physical defender and, in theory, his aerial ability and pace should help him adapt to the Premier League. His proactive, aggressive style of defending is similar to that of Laurent Koscielny, though his technique and distribution aren’t quite on the same level as the Frenchman’s. SO WHY IS HE IN SUCH HIGH DEMAND? Villarreal boast the equal third best defence in La Liga this season — conceding only two more goals than table-topping Real Madrid — and Paulista is an integral part of it. Also, he has recorded the second-highest number of interceptions in the league this campaign (66). HOW WOULD HE FIT IN AT ARSENAL? He would likely provide back-up to Koscielny and Per Mertesacker for the time being, though Arsenal’s injury record and dearth of central defenders may mean he is called into action sooner rather than later. Given a prolonged spell in the starting XI, he could prove to be the dominant, fearless presence Arsenal fans have craved for some time.","Arsene Wenger says work permits for foreign players should be scrapped .

"Hakuna Matata! Sir Elton John has long observed that The Lion King musical ‘is a law unto itself’ — and how so. After more than a decade of performances in cities all over the world, it was confirmed this week that the stage show is the biggest beast in the jungle. The Lion King — based on the 1994 Disney film of the same name — has taken more money at the box office than any other production in history. The Lion King - based on the 1994 Disney film - has taken more money at the box office than any other show . Since its first night on Broadway in 1997, the show has made more than £3.8 billion in ticket sales alone. Not only has it conquered the stage, it has massively out-earned every cinema release — including blockbusters such as James Cameron’s Avatar, which took a mere £1.7 billion globally after its 2009 release. A further fortune has been made in souvenir T-shirts, posters and the rest. At the last count, there were eight different cast recordings of the show’s songs on sale. Featuring music by Sir Elton John and lyrics by Sir Tim Rice, The Lion King opened in Minneapolis in July 1997 before moving to Broadway in November that year. It arrived at the Lyceum Theatre in London’s West End in October 1999 and currently takes more than £30 million a year in the UK. The Lion King stage production arrived at the Lyceum Theatre in London’s West End (above) in October 1999 . A STORY WITH BITE . The musical tells the story of Simba, a lion cub born on the Serengeti who runs away from his pride when his father Mufasa dies. Aided by his friends, he must defeat his evil uncle Scar, who engineers Mufasa’s death in a stampede and convinces Simba he was to blame, to reclaim his rightful position as king. THE MAGIC FORMULA . According to music historian Cary Ginell, the musical is a ‘spectacle that satisfies’ on many different levels. ‘For the kids, it’s the visual elements, the colours, the costumes and the puppetry,’ he says. ‘For the adults, it’s Hamlet.’ Many have noted the parallels between Disney’s and Shakespeare’s plots, which both feature a murdered king avenged by his rightful heir. There are 22 Lion King productions in the world, which have been seen by an estimated 75 million people . GOING GLOBAL . Disney says that the 22 Lion King productions around the world have been seen by an estimated 75 million people. That’s the entire population of the United Kingdom, plus the population of Belgium. Last year, it was the highest-grossing musical on the New York stage, and it retains its number-one position so far in 2014. It has always been a sell-out in London. MONEY MATTERS . Disney dipped its toe in the water with a Broadway version of its Oscar-winning Beauty And The Beast before pouring an estimated £6.5 million into staging The Lion King — the most expensive show ever staged. THE STAGE GURU . In a colossal creative gamble, Disney hired Julie Taymor, an avant garde director who had trained in mime in Paris and spent years studying Japanese and Indonesian theatre. Taymor thought the film ‘superficial’. She said: ‘I had to make The Lion King my own. Otherwise it’s a Disney product and I don’t like the way Disney looks.’ Since its first night on Broadway in 1997, the show has made more than £3.8 billion in ticket sales alone . WE NEED A HEROINE! Taymor’s great visual innovation was using puppetry, masks and mechanical headpieces to portray the animals. When the lions cry, they pull rolls of white silk from their masks’ eye holes; the actors playing giraffes walk on stilts. The drought that ravages the savannah is illustrated by a dwindling waterhole — a circle of silvery material that shrinks as it is pulled across the stage. There were other changes, too: the stage production has more songs than the film; and Rafiki, the baboon with mystic powers, became a ‘she’, as Taymor felt that the film lacked a leading female character. A STAMPEDE FOR SEATS . In the immediate aftermath of its Broadway debut, there were reports of pushy New York parents putting their children’s names down for theatre tickets years in advance. At one point seats were reselling for up to ten times their face value. Things have since calmed down, but a ticket to the London production costs at least £27.50 a seat. THE CRITICS’ VERDICT . ‘Visually breathtaking,’ said the New York Times. ‘Pure, exhilarating theatre, unlike anything ever seen on Broadway,’ cheered USA Today. But not everyone was convinced. One critic who saw the show open in London’s West End wrote that once the last Zulu drum had fallen silent, a tiny part of him was left whispering: ‘So what?’ Catch it immediately, he said, thinking it was not destined to run and run. Oops. And the late, great Sheridan Morley opined: ‘A lot of people say, “This is not real theatre. It’s theatre by way of the movies, or by way of the theme park.” It’s Disneyfication, if you like.’ A ticket to the London production in the West End costs around £27.50 a seat and shows are often sold-out . STARS IN THEIR AISLES . Celebrities including Dame Judi Dench, Dame Shirley Bassey, model Claudia Schiffer and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell attended the opening night in London. All said that they had been moved to tears and ovations. Dame Judi said afterwards: ‘I don’t want to be in any play in the future where an elephant doesn’t walk down the aisle.’ But the show has not brought in big-name stars to fill seats, instead relying on talented ensemble casts. SPOOKING THE PHANTOM . Even though twice as many paying punters have seen Andrew Lloyd Webber’s long-running The Phantom Of The Opera, The Lion King’s steeper ticket prices and larger theatres mean its earnings are greater. THAT’S ENOUGH, ZAZU . Zazu the hornbill’s big musical number, The Morning Report, was cut from the show in 2010, making the show nine minutes shorter. Elton John (above) wrote hit melodies for The Lion King film, including Can You Feel The Love Tonight, many of which have been used on the stage version . ELTON’S CASH COW . No one will say how much Sir Elton was paid for licensing his melodies for The Lion King film — such as the hit Can You Feel The Love Tonight — to be used in the stage version. What can be noted is that pre-Lion King his annual income was said to stand at around £12 million a year. More recently, Forbes magazine put it at £48 million a year. ONCE MORE WITH FEELING . Buoyed by The Lion King’s success, Sir Elton was then involved in two musicals: Aida, which had minor success, and Lestat, based on Anne Rice’s gothic novels about an 18th-century nobleman turned vampire. That was a thumping disaster and closed after 39 performances in 2005. He stepped back into the world of musical theatre that year with the hugely popular Billy Elliot — though he did tell an interviewer in 2011: ‘Just between you, me and the gatepost, I’m not really a lover of musicals.’ MAN BEHIND THE MUSIC . The show is completed by the music of South African composer Lebo M, who was exiled to America in 1979 after student riots in Soweto. He told the South Bank Show: ‘The Lion King is not necessarily political, but I could relate to the life of Simba, a young cub who grows up in exile and goes back to fight for his country.’","Show has taken more money at the box office than any other production .

"Life takes on a different aspect when you’re dangling by your fingertips more than 300ft up a crane. Death probably does too, although it doesn’t seem to be something that troubles James Kingston too much. He’s seldom happier than when balancing on tip-toes at the top of a skyscraper, leaping a gap between buildings, or maybe just hanging out with friends – in every sense – on a precipice.

And guess what? He’s not scared of . heights. Yesterday the 22-year-old part-time model, whose video footage . of his latest escapade has become an international hit on YouTube, . explained that he scaled the crane (inevitably) because it was there. ‘I . chose it simply because of how high it is,’ said James. ‘It’s very rare . to have such high structures in my city so I couldn’t pass off the . opportunity to climb it and get some awesome shots.’ James . gets his highs from scaling tall structures, jumping gracefully over . unlikely objects and seeking out athletic challenges through ‘urban . exploration’.

Dizzy heights: Mr Kingston has scaled other cranes in Britain, as well as several in Italy. His headiest triumph was a 320ft crane in Los Angeles, from which he also did a one-arm dangle .

I wouldn’t hang by one arm off a massive crane if I didn’t know that no matter what, I’d be able to pull myself up again.’ A film of his crane stunt has been put on YouTube with a soundtrack called Don’t Hold Your Breath, by Kota.

"For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In A Man Walks On To a Pitch, Redknapp reveals how close he came to signing Patrick Vieira and Luis Suarez during his time as Tottenham manager. Despite all that has happened in his career since, one of the biggest regrets of my life in management is not taking Luis Suarez to Tottenham when we had the chance. ‘You’ve got to take him, Harry,’ Ruud Gullit told me. ‘He’s fantastic.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez kick the ball in a team-mate's face during training .

The Uruguayan moved to Barcelona this summer and has blossomed into one of the world's best players . Yet all of our scouts’ reports said that at Ajax he played wide off a striker, whereas we were looking for a proper front man. Just when I was on the verge of taking the plunge, the price went up. In the end he was sold for £22.8million to Liverpool. We wouldn’t have paid that. Age: 27 . Country: Uruguay . Position: Striker . Clubs: Nacional, Groningen, Ajax, Liverpool, Barcelona. Major Honours: 1x Primera Division, 1x Eredivisie, 1x KNVB Cup, 1x Dutch Super Cup, 1x League Cup . International Caps: 78 . International Honours: 1x Copa America. Age: 38 . Country: France . Position: Centre midfield . Clubs: Cannes, AC Milan, Arsenal, Juventus, Inter Milan, Manchester City. Major Honours: 3x Premier Leagues titles, 5x FA Cups, 5x Serie A titles. International Caps: 107 . International Honours: 1x World Cup, 1x Euros, 1x Confederations Cup. Patrick Vieira was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now. He almost came to me at Tottenham from Inter Milan. I thought it was an incredible decision by him, after he’d been such a hero at Arsenal. I met him at his house in Hampstead and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get. He had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away.

I knew that — but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before, I thought it said something about the man. In the end, his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in Italy. By the time he did become available — the following January — our needs had changed and Manchester City snapped him up. Patrick is the player Arsenal have never really replaced, but I still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at Manchester City. Shouldn’t he be at Arsenal? It is ironic that so many associate Arsene Wenger with the beautiful game, yet his Arsenal teams, with Vieira — the ultimate box-to-box midfielder — did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern Premier League. Teams got bigger to compete with Arsenal because they were so strong. They were up there with any of the great post-War teams — the Busby Babes, Tottenham’s Double-winners, Revie’s Leeds United, the great Liverpool teams, Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson — they deserve to be mentioned with any of them.

"For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In his new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - Redknapp explores the decline of English managers in the modern game. Louis van Gaal couldn’t have done a better job with Hull City than Steve Bruce did last year. Yet did his heroics in the League and FA Cup create even a ripple at Old Trafford? Was Steve, a great competitor and wonderful player for United, even considered for the Manchester United job? OK, a few times in his career it hasn’t worked out but that would be true of Van Gaal, too, if he had spent his managerial life at clubs like Sheffield United, Huddersfield Town or Hull. I don’t understand why owners suddenly lost faith in British managers. Unless Frank Lampard or John Terry gets the job, do you really see Roman Abramovich appointing an Englishman to Chelsea? Or even a British manager? Maybe Brendan Rodgers might come into the frame, but would he leave Liverpool for Stamford Bridge? Foreign players, foreign coaches, foreign owners. Steve Bruce led Hull to the FA Cup Final last season where they lost to Arsenal in extra time at Wembley . Bruce played more than 300 games for Manchester United during his spell with the Old Trafford club . Sean Dyche - Burnley . Neil Warnock - Crystal Palace . Steve Bruce - Hull City . Nigel Pearson - Leicester City . Alan Pardew - Newcastle United . Harry Redknapp - Queens Park Rangers . Gary Monk - Swansea . Sam Allardyce - West Ham . I’ve got a great relationship with the Queens Park Rangers owner Tony Fernandes — and I’m too old to be a creep, so believe me, I mean it — but not every manager is as lucky. Club chairmen talk to current players, they talk to ex-players, they talk to agents, to a ring of yes-men — and then they come away thinking they know more than the manager. Sometimes a foreign coach gets the benefit of the doubt, but British managers are increasingly coming under particularly harsh scrutiny. I don’t see the new breed of owner — with their ‘keep throwing money at it and eventually you’ll be all right’ approach — giving British coaches a chance. It was a real setback that David Moyes did not do better at Manchester United, although it was always going to be hard to be the man who followed Sir Alex Ferguson. And where’s the next generation of English managers coming from? Will the current top tier of English players go through the leagues to prove themselves, as Bruce has done? Lads who have had 10 seasons at Chelsea in the Abramovich years won’t get out of bed for what the manager of Exeter City gets paid. Take Lampard. Now he’s finished at Chelsea, would he really want to take a job at, say, Gillingham, the way I worked at Bournemouth? He probably earned three times as much in one week as the Gillingham manager does in one year. Will Frank Lampard want to drop down the divisions as a manager when he hangs up his boots for good? Harry Redknapp pictured at Bournemouth, where he started his managerial career and stayed for nine years . Scholes, Gerrard and Ferdinand make Redknapp's modern era Premier League XI . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing . Keane, Shearer and Le Tissier make Redknapp's early era Premier League XI . Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports . Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent . Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV! Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . Let’s face it, if you’ve been earning £200,000 a week, are you going to take a job for £80,000 a year that involves going out every night watching inferior games and inferior players on the off-chance of finding a gem? I greatly admire anyone from the modern generation who fancies putting themselves through that. I’ve been around plenty of Premier League dressing-rooms and I don’t hear many players talk about watching matches from the lower leagues. I don’t see guys like Sol Campbell rushing to take a post in the lower divisions, though I hear he is doing his coaching badges and I’d like to see him get into it. Ryan Giggs has gone into coaching, but it was never even considered that he might follow the Bobby Charlton route and end up at Preston. It was always going to be at Manchester United or nothing. If Stockport County had phoned him I think it would have been the shortest conversation of all time. So Giggs has not taken that risk. Why would he test himself against a guy like Steve Evans at Rotherham United? Evans will never get a Premier League job, but his record as a lower-division manager is outstanding. He gets in a lot of trouble over his comments to referees and officials, but he has proven himself a promotion expert with both Crawley Town and Rotherham in recent seasons. Would Giggs know what he was doing in a lower division up against him? Evans knows where to look for players, he’s out grafting all the time and he knows how to put a League Two or League One team together. Giggs wouldn’t have a clue by comparison. Steve Evans (left) won't get a Premier League job but would Ryan Giggs challenge him in the lower leagues? Jamie Carragher (centre) and Gary Neville have established themselves as leading pundits on Sky Sports . The modern players are as likely to want to be media men or agents as run a team, and I don’t blame them. Roy Keane is working in the game at Aston Villa and Ireland, but it seems a real shame to have a man of his stature outside United. Would they have come seventh last season if Keane had been around to pull the players up? He would have been after them as he always was in the peak years, when there were no short-cuts at United and those messages were passed from Sir Alex, through Keane. There is a story of him laying into Mark Bosnich, the goalkeeper, for turning up late on his first day of training. Bosnich said he’d got lost. Keane’s point was that on his own first day at the club, he got up early, hired a taxi and followed it to the training ground in his car to ensure he arrived on time. He had incredible professional standards and expected the same of everybody. It’s great to have a player like that in your team. Every manager wants a Tony Adams, a John Terry or a Roy Keane, a player who will have a go. I know Roy had a reputation for being high maintenance but I never found him that way. He was as good as gold as a manager and if you asked him about players you always got excellent, straight opinions. Roy Keane is Aston Villa's assistant manager but Manchester United missed his presence last season . Roy Keane's influence at United might have ensured they did better than finish seventh last campaign . Terry is another influential player. He’s one of those that change a club. If we could take him to QPR from Chelsea I would feel very confident, just with that one signing alone, that we would stay up. He gets people at it, he’s a talker, he takes charge of the dressing-room. It’s hard to find leaders, though I’m lucky enough to have Rio Ferdinand with me. It’s hard to find talkers, organisers. I don’t know why, but it is so hard to find a player prepared to speak his mind. Everyone now is waiting to receive information; they all exist in their own little worlds. They don’t talk to each other off the pitch or on the coach. Everyone sits there with headphones, looking at an iPad or playing a computer game. Is it any wonder modern players lack communication skills? Chelsea captain John Terry is one of the games' best leaders and takes charge of the dressing room . Terry is the modern day Tony Adams and a throwback in the way he bosses his team . Terry is a throwback in the way he bosses a team. I’ve got a lot of time for John, even though I know his career has not been without controversy. The modern Tony Adams — I can’t pay him a higher compliment than that. Some people may think John is a dubious role model, but I would have no hesitation in saying to any of the young academy defenders at QPR: ‘Go and watch Chelsea tonight, go and watch Terry, study him all game’. If they pay attention they will learn more in that 90 minutes than in a month of training sessions. If Chelsea ever lose faith in John, I’d take him like a shot.
