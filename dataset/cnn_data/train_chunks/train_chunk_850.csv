"By . Ian Fletcher . Look away now if you like bananas, because the cost of your favourite snack is soaring. High Street store giants Sainsbury's and Waitrose have increased the price of the popular fruit by 16 per cent, according to the latest research. Trade magazine The Grocer reported that the retailers -- which sell only Fairtrade bananas -- have increased the price of a kilo of loose bananas from 68p to 79p. Both Waitrose and Sainsbury's have increased the price of bananas to reflect rising market prices . Data from analysts Mintec showed that the UK wholesale price of bananas is up 12.5 per cent year on year to £900 a tonne. The analysts say that costs have been pushed up by lower production across many of the main producing countries and concerns over a fungal leaf disease that can reduce banana plant yield by up to 50per cent. Co-op Bananalink said that shipping and labour costs had also increased adding that 79p was a more sustainable price for growers than 68p but still not a fair one. Bananalink international co-ordinator Alistair Smith told the magazine that he thought it unlikely other big retailers would up their prices. 'We would like to see supermarkets permanently increase the price to what is fair and explain to consumers why this is a fair price for growers.' The latest hike comes after Fairtrade Foundation warned in May that the UK supermarket price war was encouraging Fairtrade growers to turn their backs on British retail in favour of other markets. Waitrose told The Grocer that the price hike was a reaction to increases in the market price of bananas. It stressed that it had long-term relationships with its growers, some going back more than 50 years. Sainsbury's told the magazine that its price increase had been done 'without affecting any of our current supplier relationships.' Data from pricing analysts BrandView.com showed that Asda, Tesco and Morrisons continue to sell 1kg of loose bananas for 68p.","Waitrose and Sainsbury's have increased price of bananas by 16 per cent .

"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Correspondent . Stephen Fry made the comments about Operation Yewtree while hosting a Labour fund-raising gala . Stephen Fry faced a furious backlash last night after attacking the country’s most high-profile police inquiry into historic sex abuse while  hosting a Labour fundraiser. The comedian shocked guests at the party last week when he blasted Operation Yewtree which has led to less than half of suspects being convicted. He urged guests, who included Labour leader Ed Miliband, to remember that ‘people are innocent until proven guilty’ and singled out former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer for criticism. The TV presenter is believed to be angry over the treatment of his friend DJ Paul Gambaccini, 64, who remains on bail after his arrest by police investigating claims of historic sex offences. But child protection campaigner Peter Saunders said Fry was ‘simply wrong’. The chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said the landmark police inquiry has demonstrated that no one is above the law. He also praised Mr Starmer’s successor Alison Saunders for continuing to investigate suspects, regardless of their fame or connections. He said: ‘Stephen Fry thrives on publicity and occasionally says some quite outrageous and highly inappropriate things. Mr Fry, like many other so-called celebrities, may consider himself to be above the law that applies to the rest of us mere mortals. ‘Fortunately he is wrong, and just because someone is a household name doesn’t mean that the past will not catch up with them. ‘Alison Saunders and other prosecutors deserve a medal to “dare” to prosecute people who are rich and famous. ‘If it is a witch hunt to go after people who rape and abuse our children, whenever it may have happened, then I’m all for it. ‘The consequences of these vile crimes last a life-time for the victims. If we are serious about eradicating abuse then we have to stay with zero tolerance. ‘That’s the least we can do for victims now and it’s the least we can do for our children tomorrow.’ Fry, who presents the popular BBC quiz show QI, shocked guests as he hosted the Labour fundraising event, where tables of nine cost up to £15,000, at the Roundhouse arts venue in North London. The TV presenter is believed to be angry over the treatment of his friend DJ Paul  Gambaccini, pictured who remains on bail after his arrest by police investigating claims of historic sex offences . Guests said he quickly diverted from his usual educated banter and went on a ‘rant’ about the Yewtree investigation. He urged the crowd to remember some of ‘the essential values which the Labour Party stands for’ and cited the Magna Carta, the foundation of British rights. Fry said ‘fewer than half’ of the people arrested by Yewtree  detectives have been found guilty, and identified Mr Starmer in  the audience. He then said the law should be toughened up to deter people from inventing claims about sex abuse. One of the guests told the Mail On Sunday: ‘It was all a bit awkward. There was a smattering of applause, but mostly there was this deadly silence.’ Referring to Mr Miliband, he added: ‘And Ed looked as if he had swallowed a wasp.’ Gambaccini is one of just a  handful of suspects left on bail by the Yewtree inquiry, which began  in late 2012 after veteran TV presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile. The pop music expert, broadcaster and author is expected to answer bail in mid-September. He has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Fry urged guest at the gala to remember that 'people are innocent until proven guilty' and singled out former director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer, pictured, for criticism . Mr Starmer, who is rumoured to be positioning himself for  Parliament via a safe Labour seat, was one of the leading figures in deciding how Operation Yewtree should run. The multi-million-pound inquiry has claimed a series of notable scalps, such as publicist Max Clifford and more recently Rolf Harris, while winning justice for victims whose lives have been destroyed. But one suspect committed suicide and others, including Freddie Starr, Jim Davidson and Jimmy Tarbuck, were told they faced no further action despite spending months on bail. Three Yewtree suspects remain on bail, including Gambaccini. The other two men, aged 74 and 73, have not been named publicly. Former radio DJ Dave Lee Travis faces a retrial later this year after a jury failed to reach verdicts on two counts. He also faces a new charge of sexual assault. Two others, former DJ Chris Denning and pop star Gary Glitter, face trial accused of sexually assaulting children. Mr Miliband’s office appeared to rebuke Fry over his outburst. His spokesman said Mr Miliband has ‘made it clear all along that our thoughts should be with the victims’. Fry is famously outspoken. Last year he offended Russia by claiming the 2014 Winter Olympics should be moved from Sochi because President Putin ‘is making scapegoats of gay people, just as Hitler did Jews’ before the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In 2010, he offended feminists  and many women by saying  they don’t like sex.  And the year before that he defended the MPs’ expenses scandal saying it was ‘not important’. Also in attendance at the Labour event last Wednesday were actor Sir Patrick Stewart, former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, cross-dressing artist Grayson Perry and comedian Eddie Izzard, who arrived wearing bright red lipstick. Labour refused to release the full list of attendees – just days after it demanded David Cameron release a list of guests at a similar Conservative Party event.

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Changes to the law will see automatic jail terms for anyone caught carrying a knife for a second time . Criminals caught carrying a knife for the second time will face automatic jail sentences under plans to be backed by Conservative MPs in defiance of their Liberal Democrat colleagues. In a significant fracturing of the coalition, David Cameron will next week urge Tories to vote for a toughening of punishments for repeat offences despite Nick Clegg's refusal to support the move. Because of the Government split, ministers will abstain, but backbenchers and Parliamentary private secretaries, who are junior members of the Government, are being encouraged to back the change. The decision means the reform will be implemented if, as is expected, it is backed by Labour MPs. It will the first time since the coalition was formed in 2010 that the Tories have forced through a change in the law while the Lib Dems vote against it. A Government source said: 'The Conservatives have always made clear we want to do more to tackle knife crime. The Commons will vote next week on an amendment to jail people caught carrying a knife on more than one occasion. 'Conservative ministers support these plans in principle. But because this is not an agreed coalition policy, they will abstain in Tuesday's vote. However, other Conservative MPs will be free to vote as they wish and these new powers stand a good chance of becoming law.' Mr Clegg was said to be 'bouncing off the walls' last month after secret Cabinet correspondence was leaked to the Daily Mail revealing senior Lib Dems were resisting Tory proposals to introduce punishments for repeat knife offences. The Mail published a leaked letter to Mr Clegg from Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander rejecting plans to impose a mandatory six-month jail sentence on any adult convicted of a second knife offence as too expensive. David Cameron (left) will next week urge Tories to vote for a toughening of punishments for repeat offences of knife crime despite Nick Clegg's refusal to support the move . In another letter to the Deputy Prime . Minister, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws said mandatory minimum . sentences were 'too blunt an instrument' and said he was unwilling to . support them. The Deputy Prime Minister blamed the Tories for the highly unusual breach of Cabinet confidentiality, and Lib Dem sources said the Tories should 'examine their consciences' for engaging in political games in the aftermath of teacher Ann Maguire's killing. Tory sources said the proposal to tighten the law had, in fact, been under discussion for months in advance. Labour MPs are also expected to vote for the changes after Ed Miliband said he supports tougher sentences . Conservative . Cabinet ministers including Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, . Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Michael Gove, the Education . Secretary and Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, have all lined up . behind the plan for tougher knife laws. Kenneth Clarke, the veteran . Cabinet minister, is understood to be the only senior Tory backing the . Lib Dems, arguing judges' hands should not be tied. Nick de Bois, the Conservative MP for Enfield North, has tabled an amendment to a crime Bill introduce automatic jail terms, which his colleagues are being urged to support. Backing from Labour will guarantee it is passed by the Commons next week. Mr de Bois said only one in four of the 16,031 cases of knife possession last year resulted in immediate custody. 'I hope backbenchers from across the House will support this amendment and it can become law,' he said. A senior Lib Dem source said: 'The Liberal Democrats have been clear from the outset that we do not agree with these proposals. 'As a result, all Liberal Democrat MPs, whether ministers or backbenchers will be voting against the amendment – the parliamentary party is united on this. 'We believe in giving judges the flexibility to use their expertise and judgement, based on the facts of each case. Prison is often going to be the right option and violent offenders who are a danger to the public ought to be behind bars but that should be for judges to decide.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said last month: 'I don't agree with Nick Clegg. I think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime. Labour has been consistently arguing that this is an issue that needs to be looked at and we definitely do want to use the legislation to strengthen the law, and we're definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after a second offence.'","New rules will see automatic jail sentences for repeat offenders .

"By . Tara Brady . Clothing giant ASOS has started taking orders again three days after its warehouse was devastated in an arson attack affecting £22million of stock. The fashion website was forced to suspend orders after the blaze in Barnsley on Friday night affected 20 per cent of stock at the site. More than 50 firefighters were called to the firm's headquarters in South Yorkshire, which is the size of six football pitches and handles £1.2billion in sales a year. No one was injured but 500 staff were evacuated and thousands of potential customers left in limbo after the company replaced its website with a message saying it was 'pausing' all new orders. The firm said customers would be able to apply for refunds after photos emerged of a huge pile of shoes, shirts and dresses outside the warehouse. Up in smoke: Huge piles of clothes were amassed outside ASOS' warehouse today after an arson attack . The major fashion firm is still assessing the damage, which looks to include shoes, dresses and shirts . Vast: An estimated 10million items were in the distribution centre. It is not known how many were damaged . In a statement, ASOS said its 'overriding concern' was its staff, adding: 'We are very relieved that no one has been hurt.' The company is fully insured for the loss of stock and business interruption, although the disruption meant its shares fell 3 per cent. ASOS said in a stock market statement: 'None of the technology, automation or structure of the building has been affected by the fire. 'Our initial estimate is that approximately 20 per cent of the total stock at the site has been compromised by fire damage and the sprinkler systems.' At the end of May, ASOS held £159million of stock at cost, of which around 70 per cent is held at Barnsley. Spokesman Matthew Smallwood told MailOnline yesterday: 'I can confirm that some orders have been delayed but cannot confirm how many at the moment. When will my clothes arrive? Some orders have been delayed, but the firm can't yet confirm how many, or for how long. However, it says the warehouse will hopefully be back up and running tomorrow. Has my order been cancelled? At this point ASOS is not believed to have cancelled any orders - yours will come, but it might take a little longer. I don't want to wait. How do I get a refund? Visit the firm's customer services page and click 'cancel order'. 'Customers will either receive a full refund or get their orders as soon as possible.' Customers have had difficulty confirming whether their orders had been disrupted or when the service would be back online. Though most expressed sympathy for the staff, some complained about the fire on Twitter. @Lameese_Yousif said: 'Can't believe I probably won't receive my prom dress. Thanks alot ASOS', while @HeyItsJoy added: 'Thanks asos... I really wanted to order today aswell. Can we all get free next day delivery pls pls.' A statement on the website for ASOS, short for As Seen On Screen, said: 'Dear Customers, we have pressed pause on the ASOS website, this is due . to a fire in our Barnsley distribution centre in the early hours of . Saturday morning. 'Thankfully . no one was hurt and we expect to be back to normal for you in the next . day or so. So please hold on to your orders, we will be back with you . soon'.

Reaction: Not all customers were sympathetic - one on Twitter was upset after the website went offline . Prom dress: Fashionistas voiced their shock at the fire - as well as the delay to their summer wardrobes . Offline: How the ASOS website appeared this morning after a huge fire ripped through its distribution centre in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. All new orders have been temporarily suspended, the firm said . Launched in 2000 by Briton Nick Robertson (right) - the great-grandson of retailer Austin Reed - and fellow entrepreneur Quentin Griffiths, ASOS is now one of the biggest fashion names in the country. Making its name with loud, characteristic prints and own-brand designs, the firm exploded into life despite critics insisting shoppers would want to try things on before buying. By 2005 it had a million users, but user numbers would only truly take off once it introduced free shipping in 2010. Last year it boasted offices in New York, Lille, Berlin and Shanghai and almost 8million users. Its founders are now multi-millionaires, a status unlikely to be rocked by this week's fire. In 2005 the firm faced a remarkably similar setback when its previous warehouse was damaged in the Buncefield oil terminal explosion in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. The firm's finances could be dented, however. With it hoping to make £1.2billion of sales through the warehouse this year, each day lost to the fire could cost an average of £3.2million. Customers can ask about refunds through the company's customer services line. South Yorkshire Police are treating the fire just after 10pm on Friday as deliberate. The . warehouse, which claims to be the largest employer in South Yorkshire . with 3,000 workers on peak days, contained an estimated 10million . clothes packages when the fire broke out. Investigating . Fire Officer for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, Simon Rodgers, said: . 'The fire involved four floors of the warehouse and the blaze was . contained in the area of origin by firefighters. 'ASOS staff had a good evacuation process in place which assisted the . emergency services and allowed the fire to be brought under control more . quickly.' Three of the ten fire engines had to be called in from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue. A . fire service spokesman said at 7am today: 'The fire is now out, with . one fire engine remaining at the scene to ensure any remaining ""hot . spots"" to not reignite. 'At its height, the fire was tackled by 10 fire engines, an aerial ladder platform and a High Volume Pump.' Michael .

"By . Rosie Taylor . World record: Bolt produced more than 2,600 watts of power to hit his 100m time of 9.58 seconds . Olympic champion Usain Bolt produced 50 times more energy than that of a speeding bullet during one of his record-breaking 100metre runs, scientists have revealed. Physicists studying the secrets of Bolt's success announced the findings after a detailed study of the Jamaican sprinter's 100m performance during the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. They discovered that he produced a remarkable 81.58kJ of energy - compared to just 1.6kJ of energy a bullet produces when it leaves the . barrel of a 0.44 calibre Magnum handgun. They also calculated that he reached a top speed of 27mph during the race. But unlike a bullet - which can reach . 1,000mph - Bolt's huge 6ft 5ins frame meant more than 92 per cent of his . energy was absorbed in battling air resistance. The researchers found he . had to produce an 'extraordinary' amount of power to reach his 100m . world record time - and because he's so tall he is less aerodynamic than the average human. They made the discovery after taking into account the altitude of . the Berlin track, the temperature at the time of the race and the . cross-section of Bolt himself. Bolt reached a maximum power of 2,619.5watts - a . horsepower of 3.5 - within 0.89 seconds when he was only at half his maximum speed, which shows the effect the drag had on his acceleration. Jorge Hernandez, co-author of the study which was published in the European Journal of Physics, said: 'Our calculated drag coefficient highlights the outstanding ability of Bolt. 'He . has been able to break several records despite not being as aerodynamic . as a human can be. The enormous amount of work that Bolt developed in . 2009, and the amount that was absorbed by drag, is truly extraordinary. 'It . is so hard to break records nowadays, even by hundredths of a second, . as the runners must act very powerfully against a tremendous force which . increases massively with each bit of additional speed they are able to . develop. Fastest: Bolt, pictured at London 2012, had to exert an 'extraordinary' amount of power to make the time because his large frame makes his less aerodynamic . 'This is all because of the 'physical barrier' imposed . by the conditions on Earth. Of course, if Bolt were to run on a planet . with a much less dense atmosphere, he could achieve records of fantastic . proportions.' The researchers, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, claim their equations can be used to calculate the effect of a tailwind, which can vary between races and significantly reduce running times. They compared Bolt's time in Berlin with his . previous world record time of 9.69 seconds, set during the Beijing . Olympics a year earlier. In Beijing Bolt was running with no tailwind, but in Berlin there was a tailwind of 0.9 metres per second. According . to the researchers' new equations, Bolt would have clocked a slower . time in Berlin if there was no tailwind, but would still have beaten his . world record from Beijing - they predict that he would have run a time . of 9.68 seconds. Resistance: Bolt developed more than 80kJ of energy but more than 92 per cent of it was absorbed by the drag . The calculations in the study were tested for accuracy by fitting real-life experimental data into the equations. The figures were from the . International Association of Athletics Federation's (IAAF) laser . velocity guard device, which recorded Bolt's position and speed every . one-tenth of a second during the 2009 race in Berlin. Dr . Hernandez added: 'The accurate recording of Bolt's position and speed . during the race provided a splendid opportunity for us to study the . effects of drag on a sprinter. 'If more data become available in the future, it would be interesting to see what distinguishes one athlete from another.' Usain Bolt is in London at the Olympic park today to take part in a anniversary games to mark a year since London 2012.","Researchers analysed physics of his record-breaking 2009 race in Berlin .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Think of origami and you may imagine delicate paper cranes or fortune tellers. But the art of folding paper to create 3D shapes has been used to make a flexible robot. Roboticists have shown off two designs of origami-inspired wheel systems that allow a robot to shape-shift and climb a flight of steps using their intricate but strong wheels. Scroll down for video . Best of both worlds: Roboticists have shown off designs of origami-inspired wheel systems (pictured) that allow robots to shape-shift and switch from either being fast or strong . The robotic wheel design is based on the ‘magic ball pattern' - a traditional technique used to create folded paper spheres. The . wheel can change its radius to create larger wheels to climb over . things, and shrink back to a smaller size to squeeze under obstacles. Each wheel features a single actuator, and sensors that detect changes in terrain. The transmission is continuously . variable and automatic, which means the wheels can respond to loads on the robot by . decreasing in diameter until they reach the maximum size at which they . can rotate smoothly. Researchers from Seoul National University, South Korea, have designed a robotic wheel based on the ‘magic ball pattern,’ which is a traditional technique used to create folded paper spheres. The wheel can change its radius to create larger wheels to climb over things, and shrink back to a smaller size to squeeze under obstacles, IEEE Spectrum reported from its International Conference on Robotics and Automation. The wheel's lead creator, Professor Kyu-Jin Cho explained that his design can shrink to have a radius of two inches (5.5cm), and expand to have a bigger footprint of four inches (12cm), using just one actuator per wheel. There are also sensors placed on the outside of each wheel to detect changes in terrain. Scientists at Harvard Microrobotics Lab teamed up with the group in Seoul to enable the origami wheels to expand and shrink automatically. Scientists at Harvard Microrobotics Lab teamed up with the group in Seoul to design origami wheels that automatically expand (pictured a and b) and shrink (pictured c and d) to enable the robot to be both fast and strong. An earlier design is pictured . They wanted to use the design to act as an automatic variable transition - a gearbox that changes seamlessly through an infinite number of effective gear ratios to alter a machine's speed and torque, or force. The point of this was to design a robot that can be speedy as well as strong, in comparison to most robots with fixed-size wheels and gears that can either be fast, or powerful, but not both. The origami wheel can do both because it expands and shrinks in size. It 'decides' how large it should be for the task automatically. This system allows the small robot to zip along swiftly or to clamber over obstacles or to haul objects along. The robot’s creator, Professor Kyu-Jin . Cho explained that the wheels (pictured) can shrink to have a radius of two inches (5.5cm) and expand to have a bigger footprint of four inches (12cm) Magic? Researchers from Seoul National University have designed a robotic wheel (pictured) based on the 'magic ball pattern,' which is a traditional technique used to create folded paper spheres . The researchers said: ‘No adjustment is necessary. If the origami wheels have too much load on them to rotate, they stall, and as the wheel hubs continue to turn, the wheels collapse, which increases their torque until they can move.’ Because the transmission is continuously variable and automatic, the wheels can respond to loads on the robot by decreasing in diameter until they reach the maximum size at which they can rotate smoothly. The scientists think their innovation could one day be used for interplanetary rovers as the wheel can be folded up and ‘inflate’ itself.

The return to TV after an absence of ten years of Fifteen To One — the most intelligent and challenging quiz show of its time, with a daily audience of four million viewers — takes my mind back to its beginnings. In 1986, I had received the letter that was to change my life, although I was so busy at the time — producing The Price is Right and making a new sitcom starring Warren Mitchell from Till Death Us Do Part — that I very nearly didn’t get round to opening it. It came from a chap called John M. Lewis, a former sales manager with BT who said he had an idea for a new television quiz show. He called it Twenty To One. Legendary: William G Stewart who presented and produced Fifteen To One for 15 years . It was a good idea, and knowing that it had already been rejected by nine other producers and sensing that John would probably be very keen to make any sort of positive progress, I made him an offer. I’d pay him £200 if he gave me a 12-month option to develop the idea. Well, that £200 was the best money I’ve ever spent in my life. For it led, of course, to Fifteen To One, the hugely popular Channel 4 quiz show that I presented and produced for 15 years. In all, we made 2,265 programmes, with almost 34,000 contestants endeavouring to answer an astonishing 350,000 questions. Once, the show topped Channel 4’s viewing figures every day for a week. Originally running between January 4, 1988 and December 19, 2003, each show began with 15 contestants and whittled them down to three finalists. To avoid elimination they had to not only answer questions correctly, but also decide which of their opponents to nominate to put under the question spotlight. The 15 highest-scoring winners from the series were then entered into a grand final to find the overall champion. Arguably, the combination of tactical skills and general knowledge made the show unique and influenced successors such as The Weakest Link. I’m pleased — and rather flattered — that a decade or so after our last grand final, the show is back. Naturally, it’s a little odd seeing someone else presenting it, but I think Sandi Toksvig is a very good choice. She’s funny, a good broadcaster but, most importantly of all, she’s intelligent. I’ve always thought that what made Fifteen To One the institution it became was its intelligence.It was sheer happenstance that I got into quiz shows at all. William G. Stewart who presented Fifteen to One which topped Channel 4¿s viewing figures every day for a week . By the mid-Seventies I’d carved out a pretty successful career as a producer/director of sitcoms and the occasional drama, too, having worked with Patrick Cargill on Father, Dear Father and Sid James in Bless This House, made a series with Harry Worth, and produced several episodes of Love Thy Neighbour with Rudolph Walker, Jack Smethurst and Nina Baden-Semper. And then I got a call from ATV asking me to go the States and look at a show called Family Feud with a view to buying the format. I ended up producing the first three series of what in the UK we called Family Fortunes, presented originally by Bob Monkhouse. Suddenly, I was a quiz show producer and, when The Price Is Right with Leslie Crowther soon followed, a pretty successful one at that. Which, I suppose, is why, several years later, John had got in touch with me. I began trialling his idea but, hard as I tried, I could never whittle down 20 contestants to one winner inside half an hour, which was vital if we wanted to get it commissioned. I realised it would work better if we reduced the starting line-up to 15. There wouldn’t be a lot of time for chat or banter but it could be done. I took the proposal to Channel 4, and they liked it enough to commission a proper studio pilot. Great, I said, I’ll present the pilot, as I understand how the show should work, and then if you like it we can discuss who we should get to present it full time. But when Channel 4 gave the green light for the first series to be made, they said they wanted me to present it. In fact, they wanted to bring in someone else to produce the show, so that I could concentrate on presenting. Welcome return: Sandi Toksvig was chosen to be the host of the new Fifteen to One which is back . But I wasn’t having that: by now Fifteen To One felt like my baby. After a bit of thought, they gave me the go-ahead to do both jobs. Fifteen To One soon became an established part of the tea-time television landscape. But its success wasn’t down to me alone; the real credit belonged to my wonderful production team and the superb team of question setters that I’d assembled. That’s what people liked about the show: the questions were properly tough and if you were playing along at home, you needed to have your wits about you. I didn’t set the questions but I did select them and I loved it when one of the setters delivered a particularly good one. One of my favourites was: ‘Who is the only person to have won a Nobel prize and an Oscar?’ Got it yet? The answer is George Bernard Shaw who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925 and then won the Oscar for Best Screenplay for Pygmalion in 1938. I remember asking for ‘more like that’ after someone delivered that gem. That brilliant team, some of whom now set questions for Mastermind, did just that for show after show, year after year. Indeed, they set such a high standard that the only quiz shows I watch regularly now are Mastermind and University Challenge. Even now, a decade after our final show was broadcast and 14 years after I sold the format to Fremantle Media, I still take that wonderful team of people out for lunch at Christmas. John quite rightly became an important member of the team — he received a royalty for every show, became a quiz consultant and wrote tie-in books. People don’t believe me when I tell them I don’t watch today’s quiz shows, but it’s true; I don’t. I never saw The Weakest Link, while Who Wants To Be A Millionaire just wasn’t my kind of show. These days, people keep asking me what I think of Pointless, but I haven’t seen it. I’ll leave it to others to say what influence Fifteen To One had on those quizzes that followed it. We were intelligent, challenging and popular and if people think we raised the bar a little, that’s good enough for me.

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . British soldiers have been deployed to Kenya to join the fight to stop ivory poaching by terrorists. Extremists linked to Al Qaeda are funding their attacks by selling the valuable elephant tusks and rhino horns on the £12billion-a-year black market. Al Shabaab, the militant Islamist group behind the Westgate shopping centre massacre in Nairobi last year, is believed to be one of the key players behind the rise in poaching. Al Shabaab, the militant Islamist group behind the Westgate shopping centre massacre (pictured) in Nairobi last year, is believed to be one of the key players behind the rise in poaching . A total of 25 troops from the 3rd Battalion The Rifles will be sent to Nanyuki, 160 miles north of Nairobi, to provide training to Kenyan rangers, but will not be involved in operations against poachers. Already in the past year, 60 wardens and 38,000 elephants have been killed by poachers as ivory prices spiral. Last year Prince William urged leaders to save ‘some of the world’s most captivating species’, and Hillary Clinton unveiled a £50million plan to tackle elephant poaching. Brigadier Duncan Francis, the Defence Attache based in Nairobi said: ‘This is an excellent example of the British Army taking positive action on an issue that is close to many people’s hearts. ‘The soldiers involved in this training will be making an immense contribution to securing the future of some of the world’s most endangered species.’ The Kenyan government has said every rhino in the country will have a microchip implanted in its horn to help stop the trade . Hillary Clinton warned that money from the wildlife crime could have funded the attack in Nairobi . In the past year, 60 wardens and 38,000 elephants have been killed by illegal poachers. Because the price of ‘blood ivory’ - illegally poached tusks – is spiralling in Africa, poaching gangs are developing fresh techniques to slaughter animals in huge numbers, such as poisoning watering holes.It is estimated that Al Shabaab can earn £400,000 a month in the sickening trade - enough to pay their jihadists £75 a week. In a bid to quash the business, Hillary Clinton unveiled an $80million plan to tackle elephant poaching in September last year. She warned that money from the wildlife crime could have funded the attack in Nairobi plus a spate of other atrocities, a theory supported by elephant conservation groups. Rhinos are also highly prized by terrorists, with the price of single horns higher than its weight in cocaine. The horns are highly sought after in Asia, where it is used in traditional medicines. The Kenyan government has said every rhino in the country will have a microchip implanted in its horn to help stop the trade.","25 troops from the 3rd Battalion The Rifles will be sent to Nanyuki, 160 .

"By . Amanda Williams . and Ian Drury . Prisoners with a history of escaping will no longer be placed in open prisons, after a violent convict dubbed the Scarborough Slasher went on the run from a minimum security jail. The Government ordered immediate changes after knife robber Damien Burns, 39, and convicted thief Dean Jackson, 27, fled from HMP Hatfield, a Category D prison in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Police warned the public not to approach either of the men. They walked out on Monday night – just a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley fled from an open prison in Kent, before being caught four days later. Damien Burns, 39, (left) originally from . Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean Jackson (right), 27, from . Newcastle-upon-Tyne, failed to return to the open prison HMP & YOI . Hatfield in Doncaster, South Yorkshire . Location: Burns was serving an indeterminate sentence for a knifepoint robbery and Jackson was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter at open prison HMP & YOI Hatfield (pictured) in Doncaster . It is the latest in a series of . escapes that has heaped embarrassment on ministers and prompted critics . to brand the prison service ‘beyond a joke’. Damien . Burns, 39, originally from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean . Jackson, 27, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, failed to return to the open . prison HMP & YOI Hatfield in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, yesterday . evening. Police have urged the public not to approach the men. Officers believe they may be attempting to make their way back to the areas they originate from as they do not have any known connections in the South Yorkshire region. Burns was serving an indeterminate . sentence, since 2007, for a knifepoint robbery and Jackson was on remand . awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter. It . comes just the day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison . was arrested after going on the run for the fourth time. Back in custody: It comes the day after Arnold Pickering (left), a . convicted murderer, was found, hours after robber Thomas Moffett . (right) was also recaptured in Blackburn . Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham. The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon. Thomas . Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was . also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same . prison. Moffett was arrested and is also being held in custody. The day release programme is . designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the . end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals. The . Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and . other hardened criminals were granted day release last year. Last . July, Ian McLoughlin (pictured above) was convicted of murdering Graham . Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day . release. Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010. And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal. Last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision. Their . escape comes a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley . absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society . before being caught four days later. It came after MPs attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'. In . 1991, a judge said Pickering appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when . he decided to kill 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to . be a paedophile. He was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and . open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex. Pickering, 44, and Moffett, 51, . had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open category C prison in . Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They failed to return as . agreed at 4.30pm. Moffett, . who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 2006 . for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’. He . threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on . off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an . explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash. An urgent review is currently taking place into why Wheatley was allowed temporary day release earlier this month. Burns and Jackson failed to return to HMP Hatfield in Doncaster yesterday evening, and police believe they may be attempting to travel back to their home cities of Scarborough and Newcastle . Despite . going on the run twice beforehand, the robber was allowed to walk out . of Standford Hill open prison in Kent where he was serving 13 life . sentences. He was eventually . caught in East London on May 7 after spending almost four days on the . run and has since been charged with robbing the Chelsea Building . Society, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, at gunpoint. Last . year, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said HMP Kennet had . ‘needlessly restrictive’ security for an open prison. Located near . Liverpool, the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to . Ashworth high security hospital,  which houses Moors murderer Ian Brady. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Keeping the public safe is our priority and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders undermine public confidence in the prison system . 'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government but I take each and every incident seriously.  I have already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency. 'With immediate effect, prisoners will no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously absconded, and there will also be no unrestricted ""town leave"" . 'I am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public safety.'

"By . Andrew Cawthorne . Eliminated three times by Brazil in past World Cups, Chile vowed a fearless and fighting approach on the eve of Saturday's second round knockout game against the hosts and favourites. Despite the combative talk, 'La Roja' are sweating on the fitness of two key players - midfielders Gary Medel, known as 'The Pitbull', and Arturo Vidal, nicknamed 'King Arthur' - for the showdown at Belo Horizonte's Mineirao stadium. Brazil, who will again be screamed on by legions of fans expecting nothing less than a sixth World Cup, knocked out Chile with relative ease at the same stage in their last two appearances, 2010 and 1998. Fitness race: Both Vidal (left) and Medel (right) are doubts for Chile as they prepare to take on Brazil . Man with a plan: Sampaoli is inspired by a chance to beat Brazil in front of their own fans . They also broke Chilean hearts in 1962, beating them in the semi-finals when 'La Roja' were hosting the tournament. 'It's not by chance that Brazil won those matches. They've won the World Cup five times. Statistically, they're the best team in the world,' Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli told reporters. 'But we have a chance to change history. We will play with courage as we did in the qualifiers and the group. If we don't fight against a team that has the whole stadium, the whole nation behind them, then the result will be quite clear.' Chile's 2-0 defeat of reigning champions Spain sent shockwaves round the world and confirmed the strength of the South Americans' aggressive and pacy team. 'Chile have improved a lot, we have developed a lot, nowadays we can play without fear. Chile will play to win. We don't want to be forgotten. Brazil already have a beautiful history, we want to make a history of our own,' he said. Ready: Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez will shine in a Chile shirt because he is appreciated says Sampaoli . The Argentine coach admitted Medel would not have played if the match had been on Friday due to a muscle injury in his left leg, but held out hope the defender might recover in time for Saturday's lunchtime kickoff. 'Today he wouldn't play, tomorrow maybe. Let's see if the next 24 hours allow him to play. Like Arturo, he's not 100 percent,' Sampaoli said. Vidal is still suffering the effects of recent knee surgery. One of the few advantages Chile have is that their training base is just a few miles from the Mineirao stadium, so although the atmosphere will be hostile on Saturday, the city at least has felt like home over the last two weeks. Chile do not plan to man-mark Neymar, but will seek to suffocate Brazil's leading man at every turn, the coach said. At the other end, they are relying on Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez to do the damage. Sampaoli said it was no wonder he played better for Chile than he did for the Spanish club. Third time lucky: Chile have been knocked out by Brazil in both of their last two World Cups appearances . 'Alexis feels very comfortable with the national team. He knows that he's highly appreciated by his colleagues. 'So that's why he's playing so well. In his club, maybe his team mates don't appreciate him so much,' he said. 'I think he's got enough assets to be one of the best players in the world.' Defender Eugenio Mena echoed his boss's confidence, saying Chile's performances in beating both Chile and Australia at the group stage had won them respect around the world. 'It's the most important match in my career. It's a beautiful opportunity for us to change history for our national team. Our team is very motivated. We're convinced we can win.'","Chile have been knocked out by Brazil in their last two World Cups .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists claim that the 'trophy wife' stereotype - demonstrated here by Donald Trump and his wife Melania Knauss - is rare . It is easy to jump to the conclusion that a pretty young woman arm-in-arm with a much older man is attracted to him because of this money - or that he is only with her for her looks. But scientists believe the ‘trophy wife’ stereotype - which sees both sexes place little importance on their partner’s character other than looks or earnings - is largely a myth. A study claims that the myth is fuelled by 'selective observation' that reinforces sexist stereotypes and trivialises women's careers. Elizabeth McClintock, a sociologist at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, found evidence that couples who fit the ‘trophy wife’ stereotype, actually match in terms of physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status. A sample of young couples were interviewed and rated for physical attractiveness so that Dr McClintock could identify a ‘control group’ for matching on attractiveness. ‘I find that handsome men partner with pretty women and successful men partner with successful women,’ said the specialist in inequality within romantic partnerships. ‘So, on average, high-status men do have better-looking wives, but this is because they themselves are considered better looking - perhaps because they are less likely to be overweight and more likely to afford braces, nice clothes and trips to the dermatologist.' ‘Secondly, the strongest force by far in partner selection is similarity - in education, race, religion and physical attractiveness.’ Dr McClintock's research shows that there is not, in fact, a general tendency for women to trade beauty for money. While trophy wife marriages do happen, they are very rare, she continued. The study found that handsome men often partner with pretty women, and successful men usually partner with successful women. Dr McClintock said that Google founders Sergey Brin (pictured left) and Larry Page (right) both married highly accomplished women - one of whom has a PhD and the other who is an entrepreneur . A study by the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, found evidence that couples who appear to fit the ‘trophy wife’ stereotype, actually match in terms of physical attractiveness and socioeconomic status. Sociologist Dr Elizabeth McClintock explained that handsome men typically partner with pretty women, and successful men partner are normally attracted to successful women. 'The strongest force by far in partner selection is similarity - in education, race, religion and physical attractiveness,’ she said. Her study found that women do not tend to trade beauty for money and that trophy wives are very rare and that beautiful women cannot often move upwards in terms of class by marrying someone. Donald Trump’s marriage to his third wife Melania Knauss, may be an exception to the study's rule. Dr McClintock said: ‘Trump may very well exemplify the trophy wife stereotype. 'But, there are many examples of rich men who partner with successful women rather than “buying” a supermodel wife.’ She gave the example of Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who both married highly accomplished women - one of whom has a PhD and the other who is a wealthy entrepreneur. Dr McClintock believes the trophy wife stereotype is most often wrongly-applied among non-celebrities. ‘I've heard doctors' wives referred to as trophy wives by observers who only notice her looks and his status and fail to realise that he is good-looking too and that she is also a successful professional - or was before she had kids and left her job,’ she said. Dr McClintock's research also indicates that, contrary to the trophy wife stereotype, social class barriers in the marriage market are relatively impermeable. Beautiful women are unlikely to use their looks to secure upward mobility by marriage.","'Trophy wives' are typically seen to be young women who appeal to their husbands because of their looks .

Original copies of the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence are are display in Britain for the first time. The two documents, instrumental to the founding of the United States, will be on display at the British Library - along with the Magna Carta, England's own foundational charter. The copy of the Declaration of Independence, which has been loaned by the New York Public Library, was written out by Found Father Thomas Jefferson, who later became the third President of the fledgling nation. The Declaration of Independence will be on loan from the New York Public Library. It will help commemorate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta . It includes a lengthy condemnation of slavery that was later removed from the document. Jefferson, like many of the Founding Fathers, was a slave owner. The Bill of Rights, borrowed from the US National Archives, is one of 14 original copies produced in 1789, of which 12 are known to survive. Curator Claire Breay said: 'Magna Carta is one of the most famous historical documents in the world. Almost 800 years after it was first issued, it remains a potent symbol of liberty and rights around the world. 'We're absolutely delighted that both the US National Archives and New York Public Library have generously agreed to lend these exceptionally important documents to the British Library. Our exhibition next year will provide a unique opportunity to see them displayed with our two original 1215 Magna Carta documents, from which they drew some of their core principles.'

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Two filmmakers charged with involuntary manslaughter in the train crash death of a member of their movie crew have handed themselves in to police in Georgia. 'Midnight Rider' director Randall Miller . and his wife and business partner, Jody Savin, were booked Sunday at the . Wayne County jail about 60 miles southwest of Savannah, said the . couple's defense attorney, Don Samuel. The couple posted $25,000 bond apiece before returning home to California, Samuel said Tuesday. The amount of their bond had been approved prior to their arrival, allowing them to report to jail quickly and quietly. 'There were in and out in 30 minutes,' Samuel said. Charged: Jody Savin, pictured, and Randall Miller have been charged with manslaughter and criminal trespassing in connection with a February 20 crash in which a freight train plowed into their film crew on a railroad bridge in southeast Georgia . Miller, Savin and executive producer Jay Sedrish were indicted July 3 on charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespassing in connection with the crash that occurred the day the filmmakers began shooting a movie based on the life of singer Gregg Allman. On February 20, a freight train plowed into the crew as well as a metal-framed bed placed across the tracks as a prop on a railroad bridge spanning the Altamaha River. A camera assistant, 27-year-old Sarah Jones of Atlanta, was killed and six other crew members were injured. The indictment charges Miller, Savin and Sedrish with unintentionally causing Jones' death by trespassing onto the railroad bridge. The filmmakers went onto the train trestle even after CSX Railroad denied them access, the indictment says. Wayne County sheriff's investigators have said the filmmakers had permission from forest-products company Rayonier to shoot on its property surrounding the train tracks, but did not have permission from CSX Railroad to be on the actual tracks. Victim: Sarah Jones, from Atlanta, was killed when a freight train crossing the Altamaha River in south-east Georgia struck crew members filming on the railroad bridge . Scene: Investigators say CSX Railroad, which owns the train tracks, denied giving producers a permit to be on the tracks themselves . Sedrish, who is also based in . California, was still making arrangements to return to Georgia to turn . himself in, said his attorney, John Ossick. It . could be a while before the three defendants appear in a Georgia . courtroom. Miller and Savin will likely waive their right to appear . before a judge for arraignment, Samuel said, and let their attorney . handle their pleadings in writing instead. 'They're not going to fly back to court just to say ""not guilty,""' Samuel said. 'They are absolutely pleading not guilty.' Involuntary manslaughter is a felony carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison under Georgia law. Criminal trespass is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a year in prison.

"By . Associated Press . Californians increased water consumption this year during the severe drought, despite pleas from the governor to conserve, fallowed farm fields and reservoirs that are quickly draining, according to a report released Tuesday. The State Water Resources Control Board released the updated results from a water-use survey that said overall consumption had risen one percent, even as Gov. Jerry Brown has called for a 20 percent cutback. The report corrected survey results released just a month ago that said use statewide had declined by 5 percent. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A worker uses a hose to wash the sidewalk in front of a residential hotel in San Francisco as the California drought continues . The earlier survey prompted the water board to consider the most drastic response yet to California's drought - imposing fines of up to $500 a day for people who waste water on landscaping, fountains, washing vehicles and other outdoor uses. Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus said the new usage figures underscore the need for action. 'Not everybody in California understands how bad this drought is... and how bad it could be,' she said. 'There are communities in danger of running out of water all over the state.' The increase noted in the new report is attributable to two regions of the state: Southern California coastal communities and the far northeastern slice of the state. The updated number was based on surveys taken from water districts throughout California and was based on consumption from May compared to the same month in previous years. Marcus said the board will consider other steps if the $500-a-day fines being considered Tuesday don't work. Fines of up to $500 for Californians who waste water did not seem to work during this year's drought (runner pictured jogging through sprinklers in San Fran today) Those could include requiring water districts to stop leaks in their pipes, which account for an estimated 10 percent of water use, stricter landscape restrictions and encouraging water agencies to boost rates for consumers who use more than their share of water. No region of California met Brown's request for a 20 percent reduction, but some came closer than others. Communities that draw from the Sacramento River reduced consumption the most, by 13 percent, while those along the North Coast reduced consumption by 12 percent. San Francisco Bay Area cities and Southern California cities that draw from the Colorado River decreased water use by 5 percent. The California Department of Water Resources estimates that cities and suburbs use about 20 percent of the state's water, with about half going outdoors. Agriculture is by far the greatest water user, accounting for 75 percent of consumption in the state. California farmers are just as guilty of using too much water as their urban neighbors, according to a separate report released Tuesday. The study by the University of California, Davis found that farmers could see their wells run dry next year unless the state sees a wet winter. California is the only western state that does not measure groundwater use. Sprinklers water a partially dead soccer field in San Francisco as voluntary conservation is falling well below the suggested 20 percent . The outdoor water rules being considered Tuesday by the state board would prohibit the watering of landscaping to the point that runoff spills onto sidewalks or streets. Hosing down sidewalks, driveways and other hard surfaces would be banned along with washing vehicles without a shut-off nozzle. Violations would be infractions punishable by the fines, although most cities are likely to have a sliding scale that starts with a warning and increases for repeat violations. It estimates that the proposed restrictions could save enough water statewide to supply more than 3.5 million people for a year. 'Not everybody in California understands how bad this drought is... and how bad it could be. 'There are communities in danger of running out of water all over the state.' Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus . Officials in some cities, including San Francisco, worry about the prohibition on washing streets and sidewalks. Public Works Department spokeswoman Rachel Gordon said that could interfere with the frequent cleaning of alleys to wash away human waste where there are high concentrations of homeless people. During the past 12 months, she said the city responded to about 8,000 calls to steam clean streets of such waste. The proposed state regulations already provide exceptions when health or safety is at risk, but Gordon said San Francisco wants to make sure it doesn't run afoul of the rules even as it takes other steps to conserve water. Marcus, the chairwoman, said the board will try to adjust its regulation to allow for the judicious use of power-washing, after industry representatives said it is efficient and necessary for everything from erasing graffiti to preparing homes for repainting. 'Our intention in this first round was to do what was reasonable and easier to do,' she said.","Overall water consumption this year has risen 1% in California .

"World Cup winner Christoph Kramer has revealed he cannot remember the first half of the final between Germany and Argentina after he was forced to come off following a collision. The 23-year-old German continued playing for 14 minutes in the first half of the final at the Maracana Stadium after taking a heavy blow to the face in a collision with Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay. He was eventually replaced in the 31st minute after slumping to the ground with what the German football federation has said was suspected concussion. Germany's Christoph Kramer is helped off the pitch by medical staff after sustaining an injury in the World Cup final against Argentina. Kramer has now said he has no recollection of the first half of the match . Kramer played on for 14 minutes after taking a heavy blow to the face but was eventually replaced in the 31st minute after slumping to the ground . The Bayer Leverkusen midfielder has now said he cannot remember any part of the first half of the game which Germany eventually won 1-0. Speaking to German newspaper Die Welt, as cited by The Independent, Kramer said: 'I can't really remember much of the game. 'I don’t know anything at all about the first half. I thought later that I left the game immediately after the tackle.' Kramer said he had no recollection of how he got to the changing rooms, and all he could remember was the second half of the match. The incident was the latest in a series of head injuries at the World Cup that raised questions about sideline medical checks. Kramer appeared to be disorientated as he was helped off the field by medical staff. 'I can't remember very much but it . doesn't matter now,' he said, shrugging off the injury. 'I have to send . regards to my grandmother. She has a birthday today and I couldn't reach . her.' Kramer was injured following a collision with Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay. He was pictured today (right, in the centre of the picture) during the team's victory celebrations in Berlin . Kramer has now said he cannot remember any part of the first half of the game . There were worrying head injuries for players earlier in the tournament. Argentina players Javier Mascherano and Pablo Zabaleta also played on in their team's semi-final against the Netherlands in Sao Paulo after hard knocks to the head. Mascherano appeared to be completely disorientated and fell to the ground after a clash of heads with a Dutch player. Both Mascherano and Zabaleta started in the final. Questions about FIFA's concussion protocol were initially raised in the group stage of the World Cup when Uruguay defender Alvaro Pereira refused to leave the field after being hit in the head by an England opponent's knee. Pereira lay motionless for a short while and appeared to be briefly unconscious, but was still allowed to come back onto the field and continue playing. Germany went on to win the final 1-0 to become champions for the fourth time . Uruguay team doctor Alberto Pan initially made hand signals for a substitution but then seemingly changed his mind after the clearly dizzy player furiously protested. The images provoked criticism from professional players' union FIFPro, head injury specialists and others. Pereira later said the blow knocked him out and 'was like the lights went out.' 'I was also not happy with that situation. I must confess that,' said Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee. The incidents have led to debate over whether FIFA should allow a temporary substitution so a player can get a head injury properly checked.","Christoph Kramer continued playing for 14 minutes after taking blow to face .

'We're the real home of soccer in America, regardless of language,' Rodriguez said. He predicted that ratings for the Copa America Centenario tournament in 2016, which will match the best teams in North and South America, will exceed this year's World Cup on his network. The ratings performance was a little bittersweet for ESPN and Univision, however. Both networks were outbid for the rights to broadcast the 2018 World Cup in Russia. So there was a little gamesmanship involved. Guglielmino said the intention was to create a 'high bar' for Fox when it broadcasts the 2018 tournament. Given that the games in Russia will take place at inconvenient times in the U.S. market, Fox may be hard-pressed to beat these ratings.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For more than half a century, it has been cinemagoers' favourite treat. Now there may be another good reason - apart from the flavour - to scoff popcorn at the movies. Researchers found film fans are much less likely to be influenced by irritating screen advertisements if they are munching popcorn at the time rather than sucking a sweet. Researchers found film fans are much less likely to be influenced by irritating screen advertisements if they are munching popcorn at the time rather than sucking a sweet . In tests, popcorn eaters spent less on advertised brands than those who sucked on a cube of sugar instead. Psychologists think the reason may be due to the complex way our brains react to adverts designed to reinforce brand awareness. Evidence suggests consumers subconsciously mouth or pronounce brand names that are repeated while their eyes are fixed on the screen. Sucking a sweet allows this to happen uninterrupted. But grazing on popcorn, which involves picking up and chewing the snack, interrupts this sequence. In other words, scientists say, it's not simply a distraction from what's being broadcast on the screen but actually interferes with the whole familiarisation process. Popcorn was introduced to Britain just before the Second World War when dispensing machines were launched in cinemas by the American firm Butterkist. Then with the growth in prosperity during the 1950s, cinema visits increased and it soon became available in shops. Sales have grown in recent years and the UK market is reported to be worth more than £40million a year, partly thanks to a boom in home cinema and giant TV sales. As a result, traditional plain, salty and sweet flavours now compete with newer ranges such as toffee, raspberry, chocolate brownie and even sweet jalapeno. It's nearly 80 years since psychologists first discovered that when someone is repeatedly exposed to a word or name, they subconsciously pronounce it. It has since become a key tool in advertising strategies. Popcorn was introduced to Britain just before the Second World War when dispensing machines were launched in cinemas by the American firm Butterkist. Then with the growth in prosperity during the 1950s, cinema visits increased and it soon became available in shops . But what's not clear is whether this mechanism works when the mouth is already occupied with other tasks. Scientists at the University of Wurzburg in Germany recruited nearly 200 psychology students and got them to watch a series of short films. Some of them were given popcorn to snack on, others chewing gum and a third group a cube of sugar to suck. In between the films, they were exposed to a number of ads for products ranging from body lotions and fizzy drinks to crisps and charities. A week later, all the recruits were invited to another experiment during which they were given cash and told to buy what they wanted from a counter selling a variety of products - including those they had seen advertised. The results, published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, showed the sugar cube group were much more likely to opt for the brands they had seen advertised at the cinema, while the popcorn-munchers were more inclined to choose cheaper less well-known alternatives. Chewing gum during the adverts had the same effect as popcorn, researchers found. In a report on their findings they said: 'Oral interference due to eating popcorn or chewing gum while watching commercials reduced advertising's effects.' London-based psychologist Felix Economakis said the results fit with previous studies suggesting chewing or talking can also reduce the affect of stress on the mind. 'It makes sense. It has been shown that when people worry they have an internal dialogue that keeps them focused on the problem and that if you keep the mouth busy it's more difficult for them to do that.'","Film fans are much less likely to be influenced by screen ads if they are eating popcorn rather than a sweet .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. Justice Department is claiming that Microsoft must hand over emails that the company stores in databases in Dublin, Ireland, in a case that is being watched closely by tech companies legal scholars. The U.S. federal government is claiming that it can force any company that conducts business operations within its borders to comply with warrants for data stored on its databases, even if those databases aren't physically located within the United States. Several companies that operate within the U.S. keep databases in other countries. Ireland has become a popular location for many of the U.S. tech companies. Global: Microsoft has offices all over the world, including one just outside of Paris (pictured) The Justice Department, in a brief filed last week, claims that data stored online doesn't fall under the same umbrella of protection provided by the Fourth Amendment as data stored in 'the physical world,' the website ARSTechnica.com reports. In its brief, the Justice Department cites the Stored Communications Act, which states, which states that a federal warrant requesting records stored overseas must be complied with. 'Overseas records must be disclosed domestically when a valid . subpoena, order, or warrant compels their production,' the Justice Department wrote in its brief. 'The disclosure of . records under such circumstances has never been considered tantamount to . a physical search under Fourth Amendment principles, and Microsoft is . mistaken to argue that the SCA provides for an overseas search here.

The federal government already has received a favorable ruling in the case - in April, a magistrate judge ruled in its favor, concluding that 'the basic principle that an entity lawfully obligated to produce . information must do so regardless of the location of that information.' Microsoft appealed the ruling. It will be heard on July 31. In its own filings, Microsoft wrote that the ruling could impact companies across the globe. 'Congress has not authorized the issuance of warrants that reach outside . US territory,' Microsoft’s attorneys wrote. 'The government cannot seek . and a court cannot issue a warrant allowing federal agents to break down . the doors of Microsoft’s Dublin facility.'

"On a bright evening in Iceland’s capital city, this was a game of notable firsts for Celtic. Ronny Deila’s competitive debut as manager ended in a narrow first leg victory over KR Reykjavik. The Norwegian’s side will surely advance to the third qualifying round of the Champions League after Callum McGregor ended his first start for the Parkhead first team with the winning goal seven minutes from time. In an Icelandic summer, even the night-time feels luminous. Deila could see clearly, then, that some hard work lies ahead. Match winner: Callum McGregor celebrates netting his debut goal in the 84th minute . Fortunate: The youngster's shot deflected past the goalkeeper at his near post . Celtic: Forster; Lustig, Ambrose, Van Dijk, Izaguirre; Mulgrew, Johansen; Griffiths (Boerrigter 73), Commons, McGregor; Stokes (Pukki 73). Subs: Zaluska, Matthews, Kayal, O’Connell, Henderson. KR Reykjavik: Magnusson; Sigurdsson, Hauksson, Balbi (Zato-Arouna 58), Martin (Ragnarsson 80), Sigurdsson, Finnbogason, Atlason, Saevarsson, Josepsson, Gunnarsson. Subs: Jensson, Jonsson, Gunnarsson, Ormarsson, Sigurjonsson. In the modest, underwhelming, junior . park surroundings of the 1,700 capacity KR-vollur Stadium, the Scottish . champions showed wastefulness before goal. They were slow to warm to . their task. They did find . some urgency in the second half and began to pepper the goal of the . Icelandic champions — but the game really ought to have been safe long . before young McGregor justified his inclusion after an impressive season . on loan at Notts County by claiming a deflected late winner. The . Parkhead side struck the crossbar twice through Kris Commons and Leigh . Griffiths. The former Hibs and Wolves men had started the night on the . right of an attacking midfield, with McGregor on the left. They . occasionally resembled square pegs in round holes. Essentially . a central midfielder, however, McGregor had switched to the right flank . when he cut inside in 83 minutes, beat two men and struck a low, . deflected shot inside the left-hand post of the stranded home keeper . Stefan Magnusson. The . goal marked a memorable night for a 21-year-old who scored 14 goals in . 35 starts in England’s League One last season. He went some way here to . taking an opportunity presented as much by a lack of options as anything . else. Georgios Samaras . has gone. Derk Boerrigter could have scored as a late substitute here, . but wasn’t trusted enough to start. Scott Brown is injured. So is James . Forrest. This is a squad which, on the evidence of this first-leg, . second-round qualifying tie, needs help. And it needs it quickly if they . are to reach the promised land of the Champions League group stage for a . third successive season. Deila . gave an inkling of how he wants to play with a 4-2-3-1 formation . featuring Charlie Mulgrew and Stefan Johansen as deep lying midfielders. It’s debatable if Celtic really needed that level of insurance against a . team of Icelandic part-timers. It . left an isolated Anthony Stokes playing up front with Commons, . Griffiths and McGregor behind. The formation mirrored Gordon Strachan’s . Scotland with one key difference. Strachan has the players to do it. Right now, Deila doesn’t . Scenes: The Celtic players celebrate in front of the jubilant travelling support in Iceland . Scrap: Celtic's Mikael Lustic battles for possession with Baldur Sigurdsson . Nevertheless, . the reign almost got off to the kind of sublime start which would have . rendered McGregor’s late counter academic. Commons, the player of the . year and the scorer of 32 goals last season, started as if he meant . business. As if he planned simply to take up where he left off before. In . the ninth minute, he ended some neat work by Griffiths by thumping a . looping 25-yard left-foot volley on to the top of the crossbar. He . was at it again two minutes later, smashing another long-range effort . towards the top corner with his left foot. KR keeper Magnusson pushed it . round the post, but he looked none too convincing. After 10 minutes, this looked a walk in the park for Celtic. A public park, indeed. Maybe . they even began to think that themselves. Because for all the . possession and dominance of the first half, there was a predictability . and pedestrian aspect to Celtic’s play in the opening half. In . their black and white vertical shirts, KR Reykjavik were no Juventus. Gonzalo Balbi, brother-in-law of Uruguyan superstar Luis Suarez, offered . a slither of intrigue. But, like his team-mates, he offered precious . little else. English . striker Gary Martin smashed a low right-foot shot from 25 yards, which . was gathered low by Fraser Forster. Yet Celtic’s keeper saw as much . action here as he did in Brazil when he was an unused squad member in . England’s World Cup squad. Shot at glory: Kris Commons unleashes a fierce effort at goal . The . mild concern for Celtic was this. Magnusson, at the other end, was . hardly run off his feet until the latter stages of the game, either. Commons, . the one true player of invention and craft Celtic have, was locked in a . personal war of attrition with the KR keeper, beginning a second period . of more tempo and urgency much as he did the first. Within . minutes of the restart, the former Scotland international had three . decent chances to score. He could easily have had another of the . hat-tricks which pockmarked last season’s remarkable campaign. The first two were rising right-foot shots which soared over the bar from just inside the area. Perhaps . his best chance of all came in 54 minutes. A neat one-two with Stokes . ended in the Irishman advancing on the left side of the box and squaring . a low ball for the former Derby player to sidefoot towards goal. The . effort lacked pace and conviction and allowed Magnusson to fall low to . his left to clutch gratefully. But Celtic were coming closer.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The defence against former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's defamation lawsuit against slain 'American Sniper' author Chris Kyle began yesterday . Jesse Ventura was punched out in 2006 at a California bar, a woman told a court yesterday, contradicting the former wrestler-cum-politician's claim that the incident never happened. Laura deShazo was called as the first defence witness in Ventura's defamation case against the estate of Chris Kyle, the late Navy SEAL who described the alleged fight in his autobiography. Mr Kyle wrote in his best-selling book, American Sniper, that he punched a man he called 'Scruff Face' that night who loudly said the Navy SEALs 'deserve to lose a few'. According to the account, he had been at the bar on a military base with a large group of SEALs and family members attending a wake for a fallen comrade. Mr Kyle, who claimed to be the deadliest military sniper in U.S. history, later identified the man as Ventura, a former governor of Minnesota and pro wrestler who calls himself a former SEAL. Ms deShazo, of Salt Lake City, was there for the wake because her brother was on the same SEAL team. While there, she, her sister and her brother's girlfriend posed for a picture with Ventura, which was shown in court. She said she later saw Ventura get into a 'scruffle with a group of people' and saw a man punch him. She said she doesn't know who threw the punch and didn't know Mr Kyle, but she gave a description that was consistent with him. However Ms deShazo's testimony conflicted with a sworn video deposition Mr Kyle gave before he was slain in Texas last year. She said she was 'positive' the confrontation happened on the patio at the pub. Mr Kyle said it happened out on the sidewalk. She said she didn't see what else happened and didn't see Ventura go down as Mr Kyle claimed. 'It was a time of mourning for us. A bar fight was not a priority for me,' she told the court. Ms deShazo's statements led off what is expected to be a week of testimony from people who told attorneys they saw small pieces of the alleged incident but not the entire thing. Mr Kyle, who was murdered in 2013, claimed he punched Ventura after a row in a California bar in 2006 . After Mr Kyle's death, Ventura substitutes Mr Kyle's widow, Taya, right, as the defendant in his lawsuit . The defence last week said the pieces will add up to a whole that vindicates Mr Kyle, while Ventura's lawyer said the accounts are riddled with inconsistencies that make them unreliable. Ventura testified again yesterday that there was no fight and that Mr Kyle fabricated the story. 2006 - Jesse Ventura allegedly 'badmouthed' Navy SEALs and the Iraq War at a wake for a SEAL killed in action and was punched in the face by Chris Kyle. January 3, 2012 - Mr Kyle's autobiography, American Sniper, is published with an account of the alleged incident, but without identifying Ventura as the man involved. January 4, 2012 - Mr Kyle appears on the Opie and Anthony Show to promote his book and, in response to a call-in question, claims it was Ventura who he punched . January 8, 2012 - Ventura appears on the Alex Jones radio show to deny the rumours. He files a defamation lawsuit and demands Mr Kyle retracts the claims . February 2, 2013 - Mr Kyle is shot dead along with his friend at a shooting range in Erath County, Texas, in an unrelated incident. May 2013 - Ventura substitutes Mr Kyle's widow, Taya, as the defendant in his lawsuit . In his second day on the stand, Ventura, who now makes his living mostly off TV, said he blames the book for a 90 per cent drop in his earnings since it came out in January 2012. He said job offers have dried up as a result. Ventura said he earned close to $11million from 2002-2012. The defence introduced income tax returns showing his income was in decline over the period. He enjoyed a high of $3.8million in 2003, while under contract to MSNBC. He made $676,455 in 2011, before the book came out, during the last season of his truTV series 'Conspiracy Theory.' Ventura made $190,378 in 2012 and said he thinks truTV canceled the series because of the controversy over Kyle's book. But he acknowledged he can't prove it. But Kyle estate attorney Chuck Webber suggested the falloff was Ventura's own fault because of what the lawyer called his propensity for making outrageous and offensive statements on TV and in his own books. Besides the financial hit, Ventura said Mr Kyle's story hurt his reputation within the tight-knit SEAL community. He said he no longer feels welcome at reunions. 'It's a hole in my heart,' he testified. Ventura and Mr Kyle were at the pub near a SEAL base in Coronado on October 12, 2006. Ventura was in town for a SEAL reunion, while Mr Kyle was there for the wake for Michael Monsour, who threw himself on a grenade. Mr Kyle said in his deposition that Ventura was being offensive and that he thought Ventura was about to hit him, so he decked him first.","Laura deShazo was called as first defence witness in the defamation lawsuit .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain’s new man in Brussels is set to be a Tory peer he seems to struggle to get David Cameron to listen to him. Lord Hill – who once tried, and failed, to resign from the government - has been nominated as the UK's candidate to become European Commissioner. But just three weeks when asked if he would take the job, he replied: ‘Non, non, non.’ Lord Hill insisted three weeks ago that he did not want the EU Commissioner job, but his name will be put to a summit in Brussels this week . Lord Hill had been Conservative Leader of the House of Lords but at a European Council summit he on Wednesday night his name will be put the EU's 28 national leaders . The Prime Minister said he had picked the former education minister for his 'excellent combination of political and private sector experience'. 'Half his career has been spent in business, half in government at the highest levels, most recently doing an excellent job as leader of the House of Lords where he has proven a skilled negotiator respected by all parties,' he said. 'And having founded his own company, he also has a strong understanding of the private sector and how the EU can help businesses to generate growth and create jobs.' However, the appointment attracted ridicule as it emerged Mr Cameron appeared to have ignored Lord Hill’s own misigivings, and not for the first time. In 2012, he secured a meeting with the PM to tender his resignation. But instead of accepting – or protesting – Lord Hill’s decision, Mr Cameron reportedly told him to carry on his good work, and strode out of the room after being told he was late for a photocall. As a result, Lord Hill remained in post. Then last month he appeared to rule himself out as a candidate for European Commissioner. Asked if he wanted to go to Brussels, he told the Conservative Home website: 'Non, non, non. ‘First, I don't believe I'm going to be asked. Secondly, I like it here. I quite like it at home, in the British Isles.' In a separate interview with PoliticsHome, Lord Hill also confessed: ‘I am not very good at thinking long term.’ Yet his role in Brussels could be key to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reform of the EU, before Britain holds an in-out referendum in 2017. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Sometimes in Brussels not being seen to campaign for jobs is an effective way to go about your business.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said Lord Hill has a strong understanding of the EU . Lord Hill worked in the Conservative Research Unit and as special adviser to Kenneth Clarke in the 1980s and served in the Number 10 Policy Unit 1991-2 and as political secretary to Prime Minister John Major. The choice of Lord Hill, ahead of widely-mooted contenders including Andrew Lansley, Andrew Mitchell and William Hague, means that Mr Cameron avoids a potentially difficult by-election. Lord Hill said he believed the UK should play 'a leading role in the EU'. 'The European Union faces two great challenges. First, how to spread growth and jobs across Europe. Second, how to strengthen public support in many countries for the European Union,' he said. 'The European Commission will have a vital role to play in delivering that change. 'So it's a huge responsibility to have the opportunity to play a part in reforming the EU but it is one that I am excited to have been offered. I look forward to working with Jean-Claude Juncker, other member states and the European Parliament to achieve this change. 'I also believe that the UK's interests are best served by playing a leading role in the EU, shaping the organisation as it changes to meet the challenges it now faces. 'In five years' time, when the next European elections take place, I want to be able to say to people across Europe - including Britain - that the European Commission has heeded their concerns and changed the EU for the better.' A Cambridge history graduate, Jonathan Hill cut his teeth politically in the Conservative Research Department, joining in 1985 - two years before David Cameron trod the same path - having decided that a job in the City was not for him. A big break came the following year when he landed a plum position as special adviser Ken Clarke, then newly promoted to employment minister in Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet, and going on to follow his new boss to postings at health and trade and industry. After brief stint in PR, the rsie to power of John Major saw him return to the world of politics in 1991 with a job in the No 10 Policy Unit. His next big break came on the eve of the 1992 general election when Mr Major chose him for the crucial post of political secretary. He was at the prime minister's side throughout the campaign, and in the bitter parliamentary battles that followed with the Tory Eurosceptics over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation EEF and chair of Ceemet, the organisation representing European manufacturing in Brussels, said: 'Lord Hill's nomination is a positive and diplomatic move. 'It is essential that he secures a key economic portfolio on behalf of the UK so that he can bring some rigour to economic reform and industrial revival in Brussels, with a focus on further trade deals and supportive and flexible social policies.’","Prime Minister nominates Tory peer as the UK's new EU Commissioner .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Hearing aids have been free on the NHS since the health service was set up . Thousands of elderly people will be blocked from getting hearing aids on the NHS, under plans being considered by health service bosses. Hearing aids have been free on the NHS ever since the health service was founded in 1948 - but one GP-led group has put forward plans to charge patients for all but the most hard-of-hearing. In North Staffordshire elderly patients that are struggling to hear will now be forced to pay up to £3,000 to go private. Labour's shadow health secretary said the development showed there was an 'accelerating postcode lottery' in the NHS which could be rolled out across the country hitting millions. Some 10 million people in the UK are affected by hearing loss - with that number set to soar to 14.5 million by 2031. Mr Burnham said people were being denied treatment because of 'arbitrary' rules decided by clinical commissioning groups - which now run the NHS. In a speech in the Commons this afternoon, he said: 'There is now a proposal in one area to end the provision of hearing aids on the NHS. This is totally unacceptable.' The charity Action on Hearing Loss has warned the move sets a dangerous national precedent which could leave 'millions unable to live their lives'. Mr Burnham asked the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt if he would guarantee that patients won’t be forced to pay for hearing aids on his watch. Mr Hunt refused. The issue was raised after the pair clashed during health questions over warnings from leading doctors that patients are being denied 'vital' surgical procedures because local health authorities are imposing restrictions on care. The Royal College of Surgeons said that patients across England are facing a postcode lottery as to whether or not they get some types of treatment. Mr Burnham said guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence was being contradicted and asked Mr Hunt to 'act immediately'. The Health Secretary insisted Nice guidance should be followed but added more people are being treated every year, including knee and hip replacements, due to extra doctors in the NHS. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham challenged his Tory counterpart Jeremy Hunt to end the 'totally unacceptable' post code lottery in the the NHS . Mr Burnham then told Mr Hunt: 'You say CCGs should be following Nice guidance but they are not. 'Seven out of 10 are not following the guidance and people today waiting for operations will be left in pain because you are not acting. 'The truth is the reorganisation has resulted in a postcode lottery writ large. Mr Hunt replied: 'I make it absolutely clear that everyone should follow Nice guidance. 'But as you talked about the reorganisation, will you please accept we are doing 850,000 more operations on the NHS every single year? 'That means more people are getting help with their hearing, with their hips, with their knees, with all the other things that they need and that reorganisation is something you bitterly opposed.' 'You must now realise you were wrong to oppose it then and wrong to oppose it now.'","Hearing aids have been free on the NHS since it was founded in 1948 .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Two police officers visited the home of a married couple just one hour before they were stabbed to death, it was revealed today. Pin Chang, 58, and his wife Quoi Chang, 50, were found with fatal injuries at their semi-detached house in Solihull, West Midlands, in the early hours of July 7. A 23-year-old man, understood to be their son Carl Chang, was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains under police guard in hospital with serious injuries. Pin Chang, 58, and his wife Quoi Chang, 50, were found with fatal stab injuries at their home in Solihull, West Midlands (pictured). A man, 23, thought to be their son Carl Chang, has been arrested as a murder suspect . It is thought he will undergo a mental health assessment in the next few days. West Midlands Police initially said officers were called to the Chang’s family home on leafy Hermitage Road just after 5am. But today, it emerged that West Midlands Ambulance Service were first called to the semi-detached house at 3.39am that morning. Paramedics alerted West Midlands Police and two officers arrived at the scene at 3.56am. The officers then left the house at 4.48am after liaising with the ambulance team who also left at 5.06am. It is currently unclear as to why the services left the address at this time. But shockingly just 11 minutes later at 5.17am a 999 call was received from the Chang household and ambulance crews arrived back at the house at 5.26am. The same two police officers then arrived at the property at 5.33am where they found the married couple with fatal stab wounds. Now the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) are investigating West Midlands Police's handling of the incident. West Midlands Police originally said they were called to the property at about 5am. However, the service has now said they actually arrived shortly before 4am - and left an hour later . A spokesperson for the watchdog said: 'The IPCC received a referral from West Midlands Police on 7 July relating to the deaths of Pin and Quoi Chang earlier that day. 'The referral was on a mandatory basis due to prior police contact. 'The IPCC received further information from West Midlands Police relating to the incident on the 11 July and we are currently assessing the level, if any, of IPCC involvement.' Both West Midlands Police and West Midlands Ambulance confirmed the timings of the two visits but said all officers and crew involved remained at work. Police have refused to name the 23-year-old man who has been arrested but he was named locally as the Chang’s eldest son Carl. He lived at the address with his parents and two siblings, Joseph, 20, and Rebecca, 18, and attends Manchester Metropolitan University according to his Facebook page. Last week neighbours spoke of their shock after the two bodies were found. Theo Sotiriou, 35, who runs Theo’s Food opposite Hermitage Road, said: 'It is ironic that Solihull was actually voted the best place to live in the UK not so long ago and now look. It is really shocking.' Neighbours - who have described the Changs as a 'quiet family' - have spoken of their shock at the deaths. Tributes were left at the scene following last week's attack (pictured) Another 25-year-old neighbour said: 'They are a Chinese or Vietnamese family, the Changs. 'They have two sons, aged 23 and 20, and one daughter, who is 18. Carl is the elder son, then there is Joseph and Rebecca. 'They were a quiet family. You hardly see them really. 'They just keep themselves to themselves to be honest. It is such a shame, it is awful really. 'It is a lovely, quiet area and no-one expected anything like that.' Another neighbour added: 'The mother was a very quiet woman. I believe there were two sons and a daughter who lived there. You hardly ever saw their father either.'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Thundering around a track without a seatbelt and speeding round sharp corners minus a helmet - these pictures show some of Britain's most daring racing drivers during the golden age of motorsport. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, racers would throw caution to the wind - taking part in competitions with very few safety precautions. Consequently, motor racing was considered an expensive and dangerous but prestigious hobby. Now, 5,000 photographs taken by racing driver and photographer Bill Brunell have been added to the Motoring Picture Library, celebrating the sport's most treacherous - and popular - era. A collection of 5,000 images that give a rare insight into British motorsport in the 1920s and 1930s have been digitalised. This picture shows an Austin 7 driven by B. Sparrow as it loses control at Donington Park on May 13, 1933 . The images, including this of an Alfa Romeo 2600 by the chequered flags at the Brooklands circuit in Surrey, were taken by British photographer Bill Brunell . Mr Brunell, who took this image of Raymond Mays in his Bugatti Brescia at the Porthcawl Circuit in Wales on June 29, 1922, famously won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1926 alongside Victor. A. Bruce . Mr Brunell's collection, including this picture showing The Austin 7 works team at Brooklands in 1937, has now been added to the online Motoring Picture Library . Mr Brunell frequently competed in rallies and trials - most famously partnering with respected racer Victor. A. Bruce in 1926 when the duo became the first Englishmen to win the Monte Carlo Rally. Mr Brunell also captured moments from the racing career of his daughter Kitty Brunell. Miss Brunell participated in many motoring events throughout her career - including the Monte Carlo Rally of 1929 where she drove the Talbot 14/45, which she had part designed. Talbot were so impressed with Miss Brunell's driving and design skills, they built another car for her in the 1930s - which was known as Kitty II. In this heart-warming family picture, Mr Brunell can be seen speaking with his racing driver daughter Kitty while she stands on a Singer 8 Junior . This picture, shot on glass plate by the photographer, shows racing driver Earl Howe sitting in a Delage GP at Brooklands in May 1931 . Racers line up along the track before the start of 1930 Irish Grand Prix - which was held in Phoenix Park in Dublin, Ireland . The Wolseley Hornet Special motorcar makes it way up a hilly section at Bagshot circuit in Surrey, circa 1933 . Crowds of motorsport fans gather on the side of the road to watch a Singer Nine scale a particularly steep section of track . In 1933, Miss Brunell made history by becoming the first, and so far only, woman to win Britain's RAC Rally. The competition is now know as the Wales Rally GB. Jon Day, Motoring Picture Library Manager, said: 'Brunell's photography, shot mainly on glass plate in the 1920s and 1930s, is an evocative reminder of the golden age of British motoring, capturing perfectly the mood and spirit of the era. 'From street and social scenes to events, trials and rallies throughout Great Britain and Europe, Brunell's images are an important historical record with artistic merit in their own right. Kitty Brunell dons her overalls to work on her Singer Junior at the Monte Carlo rally 1928. Her father is pictured handing her a tool . A mechanic lays under a Lea-Francis 1496S cc that was retired from racing due to engine issues at the JCC Double Twelve competition - held at Brooklands . A Bugatti type 37 thunders round a corner in a cloud of dust during the Bugatti Owners Club hill climb in 1935 . Three racers driving MG J2s speed through a river at Tarr Steps in north Devon during the Barnstaple Trial in 1932 . An unnamed driver takes a brief break from racing to feed a deer from their BSA 1075 cc in Richmond Park, Surrey circa 1922 . A group of people stand and chat around a Bugatti type 43, while a mechanic gets to work on the vehicle's engine . 'These fantastic images have taken National Motor Museum staff and volunteers over three years to digitise from the original glass plate negative as well as researching the content of each picture. 'The original negatives have subsequently been re-packaged and archived within the Museum collection.' The Hampshire-based Motoring Picture Library contains an archive of over one million photographic images and is one of the most comprehensive sources of motoring photographs anywhere in the world. Previously, the images had been held by the National Motor Museum Trust in the Bill Brunell Photographic Collection.","Unique collection of 5,000 images gives a rare insight in to British motorsport in the 1920s and 1930s .

Tahir Alam, of the Park View Educational Trust, made the announcement today outside the gates of Park View Academy in Alum Rock, Birmingham. The trust has been the focus of allegations made in the anonymous Trojan Horse letter - now widely held to be a hoax - alleging the existence of a clique of hardline Muslims attempting to seize control of Birmingham schools. Scroll down for video . Tahir Alam has been accused of being part of the Trojan Horse plot to take over Birmingham Schools . Those allegations triggered several inquiries and last month the trust's three schools were placed in special measures by Ofsted. Mr Alam has always denied any wrongdoing and branded the investigations 'a witch hunt'. His resignation comes the day after teachers at a Bradford comprehensive were suspended after clashing with governors who allegedly wanted to institute a similar system in their schools. Mr Alam launched a scathing attack on outgoing Education Secretary Michael Gove, Ofsted and others, as he announced he would be standing down. After four months of inspections and scrutiny, the capacity of the trust's three schools - Park View, Golden Hillock and Nansen - to continue to offer an outstanding education 'is at risk of being seriously compromised', he said. 'We believe strongly that we have justice on our side, and we know we have the support of many from within and outside Birmingham, including our students, parents and members of staff,' Mr Alam said. Park View school in Birmingham was at the centre of the allegations of a plot by hardline Muslims . 'However, we are not prepared to subject our school communities to the further period of intense and bitter pressure that our continuing as members of Park View Educational Trust will see them face. 'And it is for this reason, and with a deep sense of injustice and sadness, that today we are announcing our intention to resign our positions at Park View Educational Trust and allow new people to assume responsibility with the aim of continuing the success of our schools.' Mr Alam said the reputation of Park View School had been brought to the point of destruction, and the effect on the communities of the allegations and investigations had been 'appalling'. In a statement, Mr Alam said he and the trust's other trustees were 'immensely proud' of the role they had played in improving Park View and raising achievement at Nansen and Golden Hillock.","Trust was in charge of three schools inspected over claims .

"By . Toby Mcdonald . Dr Louise Richardson said she was . taunted by members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club after being . refused an honorary membership . The head of Scotland’s oldest university has revealed how she was taunted by members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club after being refused an honorary membership. Louise Richardson, principal at St Andrews, said club ties were waved in her face following the snub. The R&A, which has 2,400 male members worldwide, will vote on September 18 on whether or not to admit women. It will require a two-thirds majority to change the rules of the 260-year-old club. Last year, a political storm erupted when the Open was held at men-only club Muirfield, near Edinburgh. Alex Salmond pledged not to attend amid an international outcry. Dr Richardson was drawn into the same storm when it emerged she would not receive the customary invite to join that is extended to St Andrews University principals. Now the Irish-American academic, a world expert on terrorism, said in a US interview that club members had waved their ties in the club colours, in her face. She added: ‘To draw my attention, lest I didn’t notice. They think that’s funny. ‘Once or twice, female professors have seen me in situations where I’m surrounded by men wearing their R&A ties, and they get really upset and offended for me.’ Dr Richardson’s two predecessors were automatically offered honorary membership of the club, on taking office. But despite the intervention of First Minister Alex Salmond, the R&A would not overturn its ban. The 56-year-old political scientist told the New York Times: ‘I, being kind of a professional and a pragmatist, said, “Oh, we can work something out; this is silly”. But little did I know. ‘The last thing I want to do is sound . strident about this because on my list of concerns, it’s not high up . there, and yet it’s tough when you think about it.’ The R&A, which is also the governing body of the sport around the world, will vote on September 18 whether to admit women. The R&A, which has 2,400 male members, will vote on whether or not to admit women later this year . It will require a two-thirds majority to change the rules of the 260-year-old club. Dr Richardson said the men-only policy had caused problems since her appointment in 2009 by making it impossible for her to meet potential donors face-to-face on the R&A’s turf. She added: ‘A supporter of the university asked if he could have lunch at the R&A today. I had to arrange for somebody I know to take him because I can’t. ‘And I had to arrange for another member of the staff to take his wife to lunch some place in town because she can’t get into the R&A, either.’ The principal said she had occasionally been invited into the clubhouse but had refused. She added: ‘Once a month wives that are well-behaved are invited to a lunch. But I’ve said, “I’m not eating in the clubhouse until women can enter”.’","Dr Louise Richardson was taunted by Royal and Ancient Golf Club members .

"By . Jason Groves . The Government is owed £22billion – enough to give every taxpayer a £750 rebate or build 1,500 new schools. A report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee reveals a further £32billion has been written off over the last five years – equal to more than £1,000 per taxpayer. Most of the debt stems from uncollected taxes, but huge sums are also owed in overpaid benefits and tax credits, unpaid court fines and student loans. Much of it has languished uncollected for years, with little prospect of ever being recovered. Commons Public Accounts Committee chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the Government had 'failed' to manage the debt which she said was 'just not good enough' The committee’s chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said: ‘The Government has failed to take a strategic, cross-government approach to managing that debt. Instead, its treatment of debt has been characterised by neglect and periodic large write-offs. ‘In the current climate of tight public finances, that’s just not good enough.’ HM Revenue and Customs is the worst offender, with total debts of £15.1billion, including £3billion in overpaid tax credits and £1.5billion in uncollected corporation tax.

"By . Brendan Carlin . Reaction: David Puttnam said it was 'wrong' to argue filming in the Lords would belittle the place . Film producer David Puttnam last night attacked the ‘forces of reaction’ at Westminster after peers refused to allow a new version of Tarzan to be filmed in the House of Lords. Warner Brothers, the makers of the film, Tarzan The Untamed, had planned to use the ornate Chamber because in the original Tarzan Of The Apes novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the hero is the son of a British lord and lady. But after peers rejected the move amid fears it would ‘demean’ the Chamber, Lord Puttnam, whose films include The Mission and Chariots Of Fire, issued a scathing attack. The Labour peer said it was ‘wrong’ to argue that filming in the Lords would belittle the place. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, he said it was a ‘ludicrous’ argument to make. Lord Puttnam stressed he had no involvement in the film, which will star Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgard in the title role, and had only proposed the Lords plan as he is unpaid chairman of Film London, a not-for-profit agency which promotes the capital as a venue for movie-making. But he added: ‘There are always the forces of reaction. In the end, you have to overcome them.’ Labour peer Lord McAvoy, who led opposition to the idea, said commercial filming in the House of Lords would ‘diminish the Chamber’. But another peer told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is ridiculous. It’s not as though they were asking permission to swing on a rope from one side of the Chamber to the other.’ Until recently, commercial filming was banned across the entire parliamentary estate. But 12 months ago, MPs relaxed the ban in the Commons in a move designed to help pay for repairs to the increasingly run-down Palace of Westminster. The Lords’ administration and works committee followed suit a few weeks ago, and approved the specific Tarzan request from Lord Puttnam only for it to be rescinded later by a more senior committee. The new film, featuring Wolf Of Wall Street star Margot Robbie as Jane, will be the latest of dozens of movies based on the original 1914 novel. The full cast list will be published tomorrow.

The defender, who will also miss Tuesday's semi-final against Germany through suspension, said: 'It was a coward’s tackle - some people say it was normal, but I don’t think it was... 'That kind of challenge isn’t done. You can’t get the ball from someone by putting your knee into a player’s back, it’s not normal. But there you are.’ FIFA confirmed on Monday that no disciplinary action would be taken against Zuniga, who has received a flurry of abuse for causing the injury even though he has made two public apologies.

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Adam Gemili insists England can challenge the might of Jamaica in the 4x100metres at the Commonwealth Games - despite Usain Bolt declaring he is 'available for relay duty'. The world and Olympic champion will not be eligible for selection in the 100m or 200m in Glasgow because he will miss this weekend's Jamaican Championships after suffering a foot injury earlier this year, but has announced he is 'available' to take part in the relay, if required. Bolt ran a blistering 8.70-second last leg as Jamaica won Olympic gold in the 4x100m at London 2012, but Gemili believes England now have the talent to be competitive against the world's best. Boost: Adam Gemili won his 200m heat at the Sainsbury's British Championships on Friday night . Speaking after winning his 200m heat at the Sainsbury's British Championships in 20.71secs on Friday night, Gemili said: 'You know how talented he (Bolt) is. It's going to be tough, but I think if we get the baton round we've got the speed in the team to hopefully get ourselves up there with them. 'It's cool (Bolt could compete at the Commonwealths). He brings something to every event he does. He always lifts the atmosphere of the crowd and everyone gets very excited so it's all good.' Delano Williams, the Turks and Caicos sprinter who trains with Bolt in Kingston and declared his allegiance to Great Britain last year, finished second behind Gemili in 20.90secs and then revealed Jamaicans Yohan Blake and Warren Weir had been asking about the 20-year-old's progress. Williams added: 'I guess that means British sprinting is on the world stage now and they recognise us. 'It's great that Bolt will run in Glasgow, but I really want Adam to win and show Britain can do it.' Confident: Margaret Adeoye sailed through her heat in the 200m in Birmingham on Friday . Staying on their feet: The heats of the men's 800m went ahead despite heavy rain . Danny Talbot, Chris Clarke and James Ellington also progressed to Saturday's 200m final, while the main contenders in the women's event all sailed through their heats, too. The clock showed Margaret Adeoye had run a huge personal best of 22.58secs to win the opening race - a time which would have put her equal third on the British all-time list - but her confirmed result was actually 23.26secs. Bianca Williams won the second heat in exactly the same time, while Jodie Williams and Anika Onuora both progressed with 23.62secs and 23.42secs respectively. Adeoye said: 'I was happy until they changed the time - I thought I had run a personal best. 'But I felt good - it's still a strange feeling as I've been training for 400m. I'm here to win – only the gun and the clock can beat you.' Tom Burton, Niall Flannery, Rhys Williams and Richard Yates won their 400m hurdle heats in the absence of former world champion Dai Greene, who has delayed the start of his season after three hernia operations.","Bolt has confirmed he will available to run in relay in Glasgow .

"By . Ian Parkes . One of West Brom's sponsors that threatened to withdraw its support during the Nicolas Anelka ""quenelle"" saga earlier this year has signed a new deal with the club. Jack Wolfskin, an outdoor clothing, footwear and equipment specialist, considered ending their sponsorship of Albion 'as one option' as the debate rumbled on during January over a controversial gesture made by Anelka during a Barclays Premier League game at West Ham in December. Anelka was handed a five-game ban and fined £80,000 following an independent regulatory commission hearing, following which Albion immediately suspended the striker. Controversial: Nicolas Anelka performed the ""quenelle"" gesture during December's match at West Ham . In March, after Anelka announced on his Twitter account he would tear up his West Brom contract, the club then issued a subsequent statement saying the 35-year-old had been sacked for 'gross misconduct'. With the matter now laid to rest, Jack Wolfskin has agreed to a one-year extension of an agreement that started at the beginning of the 2013-14 campaign. Albion's head of corporate sales Ian Wain said on the club's official website: 'We are delighted to extend our partnership to a second year. 'These are exciting times as the club prepares for a fifth successive season of Barclays Premier League football and it is great to have an internationally-renowned brand such as Jack Wolfskin on board.' Jack Wolfskin CMO Elke Stein said: 'We are delighted to continue our successful partnership with Albion which will continue to increase our brand recognition in the UK alongside our other club partnerships and LED presence across the Premier League.' Punished: Anelka was fined £80,000 and banned for five games for his celebration by a commission hearing .","Jack Wolfskin have extended their sponsorship deal with West Brom .

"By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . Home advantage is helping South American sides to dominate their opponents from other continents at the World Cup - and could give them the edge in the knockout stages with the likes of Argentina and Brazil looking certain to produce the tournament winner. Statistics from the World Cup's 32 games so far show South American sides picking up almost twice as many points per game against teams from other continents than their traditionally strong European rivals. And with the likes of Costa Rica and the USA doing well in their groups, even the Central and North American teams are performing better than Europe's best. Favourites: Brazil and Argentina, South America's top sides, have the best chances of winning the World Cup . Much was made before the tournament about the impact of playing on South American soil and the challenges of a different climate for the Europeans, and it appears to be having an impact. With Europe's champions Spain already out, as well as England and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the traditional European giants have been outshone by the South Americans - managing just 1.19 points per game compared to the host continent's 2.33 average. Unsurprisingly, teams from the Asian Football Confederation have been the poorest performers with lowly-ranked Australia, Iran, Japan and South Korea failing to win a game between them.

Highlight: Tim Cahill scored a wondergoal against Holland but teams from the Asian confederation are winless . No European team has won a World Cup on South American soil before - and it shows. South America have the edge when the two continents come together, winning five of the six clashes. The South American contingent have only dropped points in three games so far - Brazil's 0-0 draw with Mexico, Uruguay's 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica and Ecuador's 2-1 reverse against Switzerland. On their home continent the South Americans, led by the likes of hosts Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, have proven too hot to handle for their European counterparts and look perfectly set for one of their sides to secure a fifth triumph on home soil.

"By . David Kent . Hull manager Steve Bruce has conceded he has been forced to overpay to secure his first-choice British targets. Bruce enjoyed great success in the domestic market last summer with Curtis Davies (£2.25million) and Tom Huddlestone (£5.25million) proving particularly good value. Back for good: After a season on loan at Hull, Jake Livermore joined the Tigers from Tottenham in a £6million deal this summer . But having established themselves for a second year in the Barclays Premier League, as well earning a Europa League qualifying spot courtesy of their run to the FA Cup final, Hull are finding it harder to strike a deal this time round. Instead, they have been forced to shell out top dollar for the likes of Jake Livermore and Robert Snodgrass, who cost a combined £15million, with more to come when the Tom Ince tribunal makes its verdict. Bruce is aware their continental counterparts would be priced more competitively but does not yet have the scouting network to gamble. English success: Steve Bruce has faith in the English market after Tom Huddlestone emerged as a key player for the Tigers' return to the Premier League last term . ‘There’s the problem in our game. You identify a young English lad but you can get a player from overseas for half the price,’ Bruce told the Hull Daily Mail during the Tigers’ warm-weather training camp in Portugal. ‘If I can buy in our market I always will. You pay a premium for a young British player and that’s what we’ve done. ‘We’ve got a 22-year-old, a 24-year-old and a 26-year-old. It’s cost us more money but I would expect that. Halted: Talks between Hull and Spurs for Michael Dawson have hit a stalemate . ‘You know what you’re going to get. There’ll come a time when I know what I’m going to get from the foreign market and hopefully we can get that set-up in the next 12 months.’ Bruce is looking to add another British signing before the season gets under way, but admits his long-term pursuit of Tottenham captain Michael Dawson is foundering.

"By . Press Association . There was a home winner on the eighth stage of the Tour de France while Vincenzo Nibali remains in the yellow jersey after a thrilling battle with Alberto Contador. Blel Kadri dragged himself over the line, rain soaked, after a 161km ride from Tomblaine to Gerardmer La Mauselaine, his victory itself a story as he went solo after being part of a breakaway that had featured gutsy Brit Simon Yates. But as Frenchman Kadri crossed the line, Nibali had to dig as deep as he could to stay with Contador who, with a kilometre or so to go tried to drop the Astana rider. Home win: French rider Blel Kadri took the eighth stage of the Tour de France, a 100 mile route between Tomblaine and Gerardmer La Mauselaine . High climber: His stage victory also meant Kadri claimed the polka dot jersey for best climber . Break away: Kadri, of the Ag2r La Mondiale Procycling team, surged clear of his competitors over the twin uphill climbs at the end of the route to claim victory in wet conditions . Still on top: Italian rider Vicenzo Nibali did enough to keep hold of the yellow jersey . All he saw was a magnificent response from Nibali who went with him and lost just three seconds of his overall lead to the Spaniard, but increased it to a minute and 44 seconds over second-placed team-mate Jakob Fuglsang. Contador is two minutes and 34 seconds down in sixth, while away from the scrap between he and Nibali, Team Sky's new leader Richie Porte moved up to third overall, although he has lost four more seconds to Nibali, trailing by a minute and 58 seconds. For so long it had looked as though Bury's Yates would be in the mix at the end, sticking with the breakaway he joined 35 kilometres in until they approached the gruelling climax of the first of three successive days in the Vosges. Gaining time: Alberto Contador (left) puts in a late attack to gain seconds on race leader Nibali (right) Rural idyll: A farmer sits on his tractor to watch the peloton go past . Here they come: The riders bunched in a pack as they cover the 161km eighth stage that started in Tomblaine, near Nancy, north-eastern France . The final 30 kilometres saw the category climbs of the Col de la Croix des Moinats and the Col de Grosse Pierre, while the steep finish at La Mauselaine did its best to separate the challengers from the rest. Yates battled gamely but was duly eaten up by the peloton, with Contador, Nibali and Porte emerging as the big three as the Tour reaches its one-week mark. The big loser was Andrew Talansky who crashed on the ride down the Grosse Pierre, losing over two minutes on his yellow jersey rivals. Picnic: Spectators watch the race while enjoying some refreshments . Scenic?: The breakaway group passes the Hotel de Ville in the town of Baccarat on their way to Gerardmer La Mauselaine . Picturesque: The pack of riders cross a canal in Baccarat on the eighth stage . It was a positive day for Porte, who is adapting to the role of Sky's main man after defending champion Chris Froome had to abandon injured. Speaking to ITV4, he said: 'I'm happy with how that went, it is not really my bread and butter and I think that on the longer climbs I will be better.' He acknowledged that the aggressive riding of Contador's team had changed the landscape, though.

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . England coach Peter Moores has urged Alastair Cook to ‘stay strong’ as he tries to bat his way out of the worst drought of his 105-Test career. Cook’s latest attempt to register an increasingly elusive 26th century will begin on Thursday at Lord’s, where England take on India in the second Investec Test following the bore draw at Trent Bridge. The England captain has now gone 25 innings – and 16 months – without reaching three figures, and made just five in his only innings on Nottingham’s featherbed before being bowled round his legs and off his thigh pad by seamer Mohammed Shami. Backing: Peter Moores (right) is confident Alastair Cook will end his current Test run drought . That left Cook to issue a familiar refrain – in part aimed at England fans, in part aimed at himself – about the importance of getting his side off to a good start. ‘I’ve got to believe the wheel will turn at some stage,’ he said on Sunday evening, almost as if the act of repeating the hope was more likely to make it come true. But there is no appetite among English cricket’s upper echelon for regime change, and it was unsurprising to hear Moores’s conviction that Cook would eventually come good. ‘It was an extraordinary dismissal,’ he said. ‘You maybe get one of those in a career, two if you are unlucky. To get one when you desperately need a score is tough. I hope that’s the end of it for him now and he gets a few breaks. ‘He has been through this situation before. That is what makes great Test players: they can ride through it and come back strong. He will be very keen to put his mark on Lord’s. He is a top-flight player. He has to stay strong.’ Extraordinary dismissal: Cook is bowled by one that flicked off his thigh pad and on to the stumps . As Moores pointed out, this is nothing new for Cook. Between March 2008 and February 2009, he went 27 Test innings without a hundred – but that sequence was leavened by 11 half-centuries, while the current drought has brought him only seven fifties and a modest top score of 72. Distraught: Cook looks down after his first Test dismissal at Trent Bridge . Then, in 2010, Cook began the summer with 106 runs in eight innings against Bangladesh and Pakistan, before securing a last-minute spot on the plane to Australia with a battling 110 against the Pakistanis at The Oval. Just as well: Cook’s Ashes would net him a memorable 766 runs. Even during India’s last visit here, three years ago, Cook took a while to warm up. The first two Tests at Trent Bridge and Lord’s produced scores of 12, one, two and five. Then came a monumental 294 at Edgbaston. In other words, all is not lost. His batting, of course, is only the half of it. England have not won any of their last nine Tests, and Cook’s worth as a tactician remains in the balance after the horror show at Headingley, where Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews was all but ushered towards 160 by some negative field placings. Moores, though, insisted he had seen signs of progress. ‘What I have been impressed with Alastair is that, during a really tough time for him, he has grown rapidly as a captain and person around the team. ‘I thought his captaincy in Nottingham was exceptional in a tough game. There was no time off, there was no right or wrong in the field – we saw that with the last-wicket partnerships.’ Whether conditions at Lord’s will assist Cook’s attempts to end England’s winless spell is another matter. The Test there against Sri Lanka last month yielded almost 1,500 runs, and one of groundsman Mick Hunt’s famous flat ones is expected again this week. Nothing new: Cook has struggled before, notably against Pakistan in 2010 . Asked whether he had spoken to groundsman at the venues for the remaining four Tests in this series – Lord’s, the Ageas Bowl, Old Trafford and The Kia Oval – in the hope of avoiding a repetition of the Trent Bridge fiasco, Moores replied: ‘We do it all the time. Preparing pitches is not an exact science, people know what we want, but whether we get that or not... ‘There is a theme at the moment – and it is not one we particularly like. If it is a wicket with bounce in it, we back ourselves.’ The worry, though, has to be that England’s prize seamers will eventually crack under the strain. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad bowled 113 overs between them in Nottingham. If India win the toss on Thursday and bat first, England’s new-ball attack may begin to wonder whether this five-match series will ever end.

The Bayern Munich man was again deployed as a lone frontman for Saturday’s second Group G encounter with Ghana in Fortaleza. But could he repeat his scoring heroics and move clear at the top of the goal-getters chart? Sportsmail tracked his progress throughout the game… . VIDEO Scroll down for Hat-trick hero Thomas Muller leads Germany's pre-Ghana training . Making his point: Thomas Muller scored three as Germany opened their World Cup with a 4-0 win over Portugal . Red alert: A stoppage-time collision with Boye left Muller bloodied and dazed in the 2-2 draw with Ghana . Care: Muller is tended to by team-mate Miroslav Klose following the late clash . Nasty: Muller's bloody palm shows the extent of his injury . 5mins – Muller comes deep to collect possession after a subdued start and, after laying off a short pass to Philpp Lahm on halfway, he waves his arms in frustration towards his team-mates. 10mins – Muller, socks rolled mid shin, continues to cut an isolated figure in attack and his best work has come in chasing and hassling Ghana’s defenders, who seem content to stroke the ball around in their own third. 11mins – At last there is a sight at goal for Muller inside the area but, rather than pull the trigger, he decides to unselfishly roll a clever back-heel into Toni Kroos’ path only for his low blast to be blocked on the penalty spot. Muller’s deft touch showed great presence of mind and created the first real opening of the contest. Scraps: Muller made a quiet start to the game and chances were at a premium early on . Hunger: The Germany striker was forced out wide in his pursuit of possession . 18mins – Mesut Ozil escapes down the right but, with Muller lurking at the back post and anticipating the cross, the Arsenal midfielder opts instead to tee up Sami Khedira on the edge of the area and his shot is smothered by Ghana goalkeeper Fatau Dauda. Again Muller is not shy to remonstrate with his team-mate. 21mins – Perhaps wary of his ticking off, Ozil again scampers clear down the right and this time slides towards the near post where Muller is steaming in. The German wins his foot race with his minder but a low poke is forced wide by the recovering defender. His hunger for the goal was evident, however, and you get the feeling he is desperate to add to his three-goal haul from the opening game. 35mins – Ghana’s emergence in the game means Muller’s involvement has subsided and his frustration is evident when another Ozil cross fails to find his boot. He’s yet to register an effort on goal himself. Denied: Muller steals in at the near post but is thwarted by sliding defender John Boye . Frustration: Muller's angst is evident as he is denied at the near post . 40mins – Muller finds himself forced wide but two crosses in quick succession fail to locate a comrade inside the area – if only he was there to get on the end of his own delivery. 43mins – John Boye lands a hefty blow on the back of Muller’s head but, unlike his theatrics against Portugal during the incident which led to Pepe’s red card, the German bounces back to his feet and acknowledges the accidental nature of the defender’s challenge. Pain game: Muller is clattered by Ghana defender Boye . HALF-TIME: Germany 0 Ghana 0 – A frustrating half for Muller who has been let down by the final delivery of his team-mates but also well marshalled by a resilient Ghana. 51mins – GOAL: GERMANY 1 GHANA 0 – Marksman Muller turns provider as he is afforded space outside of the area to pick an expert cross and Mario Gotze gladly gets on the end of the pinpoint delivery to head his side into the lead. Super Mario: Muller congratulates Mario Gotze having supplied the cross for his team-mate to head the opener . 55mins – GOAL: GERMANY 1 GHANA 1 – The advantage lasts less than four minutes and it is midfielder Andre Ayew who ghosts into the danger zone to head beyond Manuel Neuer from 12 yards. 63mins – GOAL: GERMANY 1 GHANA 2 – Muller can only watch on from 60 yards away as Lahm’s sloppy pass is seized upon and Asamoah Gyan is sprung clear before finishing with authority. 68mins - Ghana are bossing matters and Muller is not getting a sniff as Germany find themselves penned inside their own half. Shock: Muller and Ozil prepare to restart with Ghana having taken a 2-1 lead . 70mins - There is a momentary scare for Muller as his number is mistakenly shown by the fourth official with Miroslav Klose and Bastian Schweinsteiger preparing to enter. The error is soon rectified and Muller remains. 71mins - GOAL: GERMANY 2 GHANA 2 - Within a minute of his arrival Klose pounces to draw Germany level, toeing home from two yards out after Bendikt Howedes had flashed Kroos' corner towards goal. The strike took Klose level with Brazil's Ronaldo on a record 15 World Cup goals. 77mins - Klose's introduction means Muller has been moved out to the right-hand channel but still he is trying to time his runs into the penalty area as Germany press for a winner. 85mins -  At last Muller has the clear-cut opening he has craved as Kroos slips him through on goal. The Bayern man steadies himself but, before dispatching his shot, the sliding Asamoah lunges to steal from the toe of the forward and nicks clear for a corner. Unlucky 13: Kwadwo Asamoah slides to deny Muller after he was sprung clear on goal . 90mins - Muller finishes the match in a bloodied mess after his head crashes into the shoulder of Boye when attempting to get on the end of a Kroos free-kick. He was still being tended to by medics as his team-mates made their way from the pitch. FULL-TIME: GERMANY 2 GHANA 2 - A thrilling contest ends all square but for Muller it proved a frustrating night. His one clear sight at goal was snuffed out by a brilliant recovering challenge from Asamoah but he did lay on the opening goal for Mario Gotze. He remains joint top of the scoring charts on three but was unable to edge himself in front.

"By . Ashley Pearson . My husband and I recently had a five-star holiday from hell. There we were, surrounded by serene, white sanded beaches, on a glamorous and remote beach resort teeming with A-list amenities, but utterly stressed out and miserable. How did this happen? Easy. It was the cataclysmic combination of a teething, jet lagged, overly excited one-year-old jumping around in the lap of five-star luxury. Ashley says that when it comes to holidays with the kids you have to be prepared . To be frank, it's all my fault. My rookie mistake was neglecting to realise that the former holidays my husband and I looked forward to needed to be adapted for this new addition to our lives. Luxe and babies don't always mix, to say the least. And from the beginning I made several key mistakes. Ashley shares her top tips on how to have a stress-free holiday with an infant . For example, as a Londoner, constant sunshine may be your most longed-for companion, but as a mum, it's your mortal enemy. Steep terrain represents a great way to work off breakfast but a horrible obstacle course for a newly walking baby. And long distances from an airport can be a relaxing opportunity to soak up local colour when alone, but alongside a baby who hates her car seat, I can promise you, it's a quick trip to hell. Our biggest problem however, was the resort itself. The venue was completely unsuitable. Marble floors and pure white interiors do not a baby-friendly vacation make. Unforgiving edges and sedate and elegant restaurants were the stuff of nightmares when combined with a one-year-old. And believe me, I am well aware from my single years that just because I love being around my baby, I do not assume that others feel the same. After careful research, and in an effort to correct my unfortunate errors, we recently took one more trip - this time with a lot more forethought and care. And happily, I discovered that with the right planning, babies and luxe holidays can in fact find a way to happily co-exist. The first thing I did was shift gears regarding the location. I began looking at villas to rent rather than hotel rooms. We were delighted to find a stunning five-bedroom property in Kalkan, Turkey, called Kalamar Dream. This place was divine. Sea views from every room, a games room, huge terraces for BBQs and laying out and a gorgeous infinity pool. Set up with children in mind, the villa also came with a high chair, baby cot, safety gates, and a walker. This time, we travelled with extended family which meant more babysitters – bonus! Plus there were no more worries about our frequently loud dinner companion annoying nearby diners. From £220 per night. For bookings call 0788 082 3393 . Operation Keep It Familiar. I have learned the hard way that babies don't love change. Time zones are unavoidable, and whist new places, new faces, appeal initially, frequently we were faced with grouchiness when routines and locations shifted dramatically. Baby Bjorn's travel cots are incredibly lightweight making them perfect for holidays . This time I packed smarter and included her own bedding. Baby Bjorn, famous for their carriers makes a gorgeous new travel cot, The Travel Cot Light, £199.99. There are no loose parts or complicated assembly and it's high quality, safe and also easy to carry on a plane. It made for a good sleep away from home. Car equals prison. At least that's how our baby seems to view it. I am openly envious of all my friends who report that their baby just loves long drives in the car. What helped us was a Brittax car seat which is one of the safest (five-point safety harness) but allows her to sit up and see a bit more around her. Ashley loves the KING II LS car seat which has a light that appears when you've reached the correct strap tension for the baby, making sure it's never too tight or loose . I loved the KING II LS, which has a light that appears when you've reached the correct strap tension for the baby, making sure it's never too tight or loose. Suitable for children aged nine months to four years old/ 9kg-18kg, and costs £170. I will never again travel without a pushchair that she likes. We have been using Nuna's IVVI after I spotted Gwen Stefani using the same and decided to check it out. It's a sleek, stylish option and looks far more expensive than it is. Baby loves it as it's a smooth ride and I loved that it folds up without taking the seat off. It also stands on its own when folded (a plus behind doors), has great suspension and good on uneven roads. It costs £600 from www.shopnuna.co.uk. Ashley got pram envy when she saw Gwen Stefani with this pushchair and had to try it out . Planes and cars demand distractions. I have learned to pack a bag specifically with toys, a bottle and snacks just for the trip. The LeapPad Ultra is designed for four- to nine-year-olds but I discovered even my one-year-old loves it. Games, ebooks, music are all loaded but I loved that it has an adult content filter on their wifi (powered by Zui) which means the web is the kid-friendly environment they deserve. Parents can then rest assured that every web-based content experience is safe and age-appropriate. Try the new Frozen app which I'm pretty sure will do the trick. LeapPad Ultra £89.99 is available in major retailers, including Argos and Amazon. Ashley says that the LeapPad Ultra is the perfect way to keep kids entertained on long flights . Let someone else do the work for you. In addition to the villa, we stayed at Hillside Beach Club. It was recently named the best resort in Turkey for families, so we figured we were on the right track. Set on a stunning bay in Fethiye, this stylish, yet fun, hotel has some of the prettiest views I've ever seen. It's all-inclusive and the buffet area is boisterous with utterly fantastic food on offer, including a 'baby chef' who makes bespoke food for tots, with disposable bibs available at every meal. The kids' clubs were heavenly: a private and shaded pool, a bouncy castle for little ones and basketball court, water polo, Jacuzzi and Xbox for pre-teens. Ashley says that the Hillside Beach Club offers great facilities to babies, children, teenagers and adults . They also look after grown ups: a Balinese-inspired spa – with a soothing massage up in a treehouse - a beachside disco, and two adult-only beaches. They also have a Beach Order App which allows you to order cocktails from your loungechair.  Margarita and Aptamil on umbrella 7. Heaven. A FEW GADGETS . Diono Solar Eclipse Sun Shade (£16) offers fantastic sun and heat protection in the car. It attaches to any window and offers two levels of sun protection, the first reducing glare and filtering UV rays and the second acting as a black-out shade which blocks all sunlight and reduces heat. It was much better than moving the car seat from side to side during long drives which we were doing previously. Nap time is tricky on holiday but SnoozeShade was a hero. It's a breathable sleep and sun shade that gives high UV protection and keeps wind, chill, light rain and insects at bay whilst out and about in the buggy. It's also nice and dark inside. Starting from £19.99. The stow n Go makes travelling with a baby less of a handful . Created by ENT specialists, Swimseal stops trapped water getting in baby's ears in the pool and can help prevent ear infections. It's all natural and can be used on babies from 6 months onwards. £7.99 from Superdrug. I also loved the Diono Stow n Go, an organiser which hooks over the car seat in front of baby and has seven pockets and two drink holders in a washable and waterproof fabric. Perfect for hoarding all the bribery implements required. £13.00, available from Kiddicare . And Holiday Must Haves for Mum: No list would be complete without something for the beleaguered baby's travel companion. Edward James salons in Clapham and Putney do a British Blow Out, great for pre-holiday grooming . MY TOP TIPS . Edward James salons in Clapham and Putney do a British Blow Out. It's his version of the Brazilian blow out better suited to those of us with finer hair than our South American friends. It costs around £100 and will give you a glossy, smoothed look throughout your holiday, during when you will almost certainly never, ever find time to blow dry your hair. Linda Meredith's Travel Oxygen Masks. Kelly Brook had one on earlier this week but fans of LM's brand include Kate Moss, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Stella McCartney – all frequent fliers. Her new portable O2 masks are skinny to pack, can go in a carry on and you can move around easily while they're on – no laying still necessary. Linda Meredith's oxygen masks are popular with celebs like Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Moss . Ashley wouldn't be without her Kindle on holiday and it saves extra room in the case for souvenirs! I love how they take my dried up airplane face and make it look like I've just had a facial. Costs £119. Don't leave home without them. Kindle Paperwhite. If you still haven't bit the bullet and bought an ereader, maybe now's the time. So much lighter than carting around books, back lit so you can read in the hotel room without the need of a night light, battery last for weeks, can read with one hand and no screen glare in the sunshine. I especially love the fact that if you become exasperated by the book you're reading you're certainly not stuck with it for the rest of the holiday £169 on Amazon.co.uk. Babies add love and laughter to everything, but I've learned the hard way that holidays are a lot more fun for mum and dad than little ones who love routine. Turning a holiday from hell into a spectacular getaway has less to do with a price tag and everything to do with gaining a clear picture of what every family member, even the littlest one, is looking for in a holiday experience.","Columnist Ashley Pearson had the holiday from hell with her one-year-old .

"By . David Gerrie . A  pioneering stem cell procedure to repair fractured bones could provide a lifeline for accident victims facing the amputation of a limb. The development involves harvesting stem cells – ‘master’ cells that are able to transform into any kind of body tissue – from the patient’s pelvis, blending them with a specially created gel and injecting the solution into the damaged bone. One patient already benefiting is lifelong motorcycle enthusiast Clive Randell who suffered horrific injuries to his left leg when his  Harley-Davidson was rammed by a car in 2011. On yer bike: Clive Randell, 57, pictured with his 'saviour' Professor Anan Shetty at Kent¿s Canterbury Christ Church University, can now ride his bike again after undergoing the new stem cell procedure . He suffered multiple open fractures, leaving bone protruding through the skin, and extensive skin loss. Doctors repeatedly told him his leg would have to be amputated. Today, though, Clive, 57, is back  on his feet – and, astonishingly, also his bike – thanks to the ground-breaking stem-cell treatment. He says: ‘I may never dance the tango, but, thanks to Professor Shetty, I will be able to get as near to normal as possible.’ There are 350,000 serious fractures admitted to hospitals in the UK every year. Five to ten per cent fail to heal, leading to multiple operations, bone-grafting and, if these treatments fail, potentially amputation. Previously, the lack of blood and DNA in fractured bone has meant newly introduced cells had no  way of ‘signalling’ the damaged cells to regenerate. The new treatment overcomes this obstacle, with the gel’s ingredients ‘telling’ the old cells to grow again. The operation, performed under a general anaesthetic, takes only 30 minutes and the patient can walk and go home on the same day. To date, it has been carried out successfully on six patients in the UK, four in India and 20 in South Korea. ‘Experiments have shown that collagen can trigger the transformation of stem cells into bone forming cells,’ says Professor Anan Shetty, Deputy Director of Minimally Invasive Surgery at Kent’s Canterbury Christ Church University. ‘These “miracle” cells are abundant in bone marrow, so may be  harvested, concentrated and applied with a collagen ‘scaffold’ into an area of poor healing.’ Bone marrow is drawn from the patient’s pelvis using a hollow needle. This marrow contains a mixture of stem cells, red blood cells and blood-forming cells. The stems cells in the suspension are separated from the others in  a centrifuge. The now-concentrated bone  marrow stem cell suspension is mixed with collagen and the  mixture is ready for implantation by injection. The surgeon stabilises the fracture, sometimes with a long metal rod through the medullary canal – the hollow inside of the bone. A small incision at the knee allows access to the top of the tibia. The stem cell and collagen suspension is then injected into the fracture site and around the bone, guided by X-ray. Following surgery the patient is allowed to partially weight-bear, and progressively increase the load he applies through his leg. To date, Prof Shetty’s pioneering procedure results in half the healing time associated with traditional treatment and, at £2,000 to £3,000, costs a fraction of the hundreds  of thousands of pounds usually involved in amputation, rehabilitation and prosthetics. Professor Norimasa Nakamura, president elect of the International Cartilage Repair Society and one  of the world’s leading authorities  on stem cell treatment, has welcomed Prof Shetty’s work, saying: ‘It will revolutionise the whole field of bone fracture repairs. ‘The patient has a more effective treatment and the health provider saves money. ‘It’s a win-win situation.’ In the 18 months after his accident,  Clive, a high-altitude window cleaner from Orpington, Kent, had  a cage screwed to his damaged  leg, three bone grafts and a raft of other procedures. As a result of the accident (for which the driver of the car was  successfully prosecuted) and the  medication prescribed, he lost his job, his girlfriend and most of his money. At one stage he contemplated suicide. At his wits’ end, Clive – who had never been admitted to hospital in his life – turned to the internet and typed in the search box ‘I want to save my leg’. He came across Prof Shetty’s name, and says he is still in a state of disbelief over the reversal in his fortunes since having the operation in 2012. ‘Six hours after the operation, Professor Shetty told me to get up and go for a walk,’ he says. ‘After being in and out of hospitals, I really couldn’t believe it. ‘I’d suffered 15 months of being told there was a good chance I was going to lose my leg, yet eight weeks after the procedure I was told to start putting weight on it and to walk as much as I could. ‘It still hurts to walk long distances, but that will improve. ‘My foot is turned out a little bit  to the side and I have a limp, but that’s a small price to pay to keep my leg. ‘My hope is this procedure will eventually be available to everyone, since it can help so many people, particularly the military. ‘The old way of mending broken bones is so painful and stops you getting on with your life. ‘Professor Shetty’s stem cell surgery is quick and almost painless, so it’s important more people hear about it.’","Clive Randell, 57, injured his leg in a motorcycle accident in 2011 .

The device, at The University of Edinburgh’s School of Anatomy, will enable medical students to examine the human body by ‘virtually dissecting it’. Dubbed the Anatomage Table, it shows life-sized male and female bodies created from CT scans, allowing the cadaver to be seen from front to back, side to side and upside down. Virtual cadaver: The Anatomage Table will enable students to 'virtually dissect' a human body . Life-sized: Images of male and female bodies have been created from CT scans, allowing the cadaver to be seen from front to back, side-to-side and upside down . It means the body and the relationship of structures beneath the skin can be seen in great detail – and electronically. Unlike the dissection of a real cadaver, in which body parts can only be removed, students can add or remove organs, veins, arteries, nerves or tissue by touching the table - enabling them to see how one part relates to another. Gordon Findlater, Professor of Translational Anatomy, said: ‘The beauty of the Anatomage Table is that you can rotate and view the body in all three planes in a unique 3D experience. ‘Although . it will never, I believe, replace the experience of dissecting and . handling a real cadaver, it will allow students to handle a virtual . cadaver without all the legislation that accompanies the use of real . cadavers.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Motorists have been warned to brace themselves for ‘Glastonbury Gridlock’ as festival-goers generate seven times the normal volume of traffic in some areas. Journey times on some routes will double, it warns – with the worst period being when people leave the event on Monday. As middle-class ‘glampers and other music fans take to the road, traffic information firm INRIX, which  tracks traffic flows and supplies data for car sat-navs – said: ‘With 135,000 tickets sold, the roads around Glastonbury only see this level of traffic once a year. Road chaos: Motorists have been warned of nightmare journeys over the Glastonbury weekend . ‘By 4pm on Monday 30th, traffic volumes will be seven times higher than normal. ‘It means that the half hour journey between Shepton Mallett and the M5 for example, will take over an hour. ‘Any journey on an A road in the area around Glastonbury will take double the normal time on the afternoon of Monday 30th June due to these increased traffic levels.’ It adds: ‘Drivers can expect considerable delays on the more minor roads away from the site to extend journey times even further. The INRIX report says the best time to leave the festival site on Monday is 6am - with 4pm the worst time for drivers to start the journey home. Music fans: Thousands of people are already en route to Glastonbury for the legendary event which has Dolly Parton and Kasabian among the performers this year . It says: ‘Traffic will start to build heading away from the site at 7am on Monday and by 8am there will already be double the normal amount of traffic on the minor roads around the site.’ This will have a knock-on effect for the more major roads. Chris Lambert, INRIX traffic expert said: ‘The journey there isn’t the one that tends to cause the problem. This is because people tend to ‘stagger’ their journeys from the Wednesday morning onwards. ‘Whilst traffic is certainly busier than normal as we approach the weekend, there are no really serious problems in terms of congestion. ‘But Monday is a very different matter. There’s a definite trend amongst festival-goers wanting to head home at the same time - generally between 2pm and 4pm.’ INRIX said it ‘strongly advises’ drivers to start the journey home from Glastonbury on the Sunday evening - or as early as possible on Monday 30th June and preferably before 7am. Expecting lots of mud: The weather forecast is looking bleak this weekend . 'This way they will also avoid hitting the regular Monday morning congestion as people drive to work. Mr Lambert said: ‘It’s important to remember that the times of the day that see the worst traffic will also be those when drivers are at risk of experiencing considerable waiting times to get out of the car park, not to mention the potentially lengthy queues even before reaching a main road.’","Journey times on some routes will double .

"By . Sophie Borland, Health Correspondent . Experts believe the 10p-a-day statins will be offered to up to an extra five million patients . Prescriptions for statins have trebled in a decade, with nearly 60million doled out last year. The NHS now spends £100million a year handing out the pills to approximately seven million Britons, according to official figures. And this is set to rise further after next week, when it is thought that the health watchdog will urge GPs to offer many more patients statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes. NICE will publish guidance a week from tomorrow which is likely to tell doctors that anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease over the next decade should be prescribed the medication. Experts believe the 10p-a-day drugs will be offered to up to five million additional patients as a result, taking the total to 12million. But many leading doctors remain sceptical about their benefits and point out that they could lead to type 2 diabetes and debilitating muscle pain. They warn many patients see them as ‘magic pills’ that allow them to gorge on junk food, wrongly assuming they will be protected from the ill effects. It has also emerged that six of the panel of 12 experts drawing up NICE’s guidelines have financial ties to firms which make statins or similar drugs. Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show 58.1million prescriptions for statins were handed out in 2013, up from 55.4million in 2012 and 18million in 2003. Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and consultant at  the Academy of Royal Medical  Colleges, said: ‘For most patients taking these pills will not reduce their death rate. ‘What is the point? Then you have to add in the potential for side effects and what might happen to their quality of life. ‘What I see with my own patients is that they think they’ve got the magic pill which is an excuse to gorge on junk food.’ Dr Kailash Chand, of the British Medical Association, who stopped taking statins after experiencing debilitating muscle pain, said: ‘Statins are very useful for people at high risk, those who have had a stroke or heart attack. ‘But to prescribe these drugs to those at low risk prompts a real concern we are over-medicalising and over-statinising Britain.’ Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show 58.1million prescriptions for statins were handed out in 2013 . He added: ‘Statins definitely have side effects – that is what I have seen after 30 years of prescribing them as a GP. To say otherwise is just not true.’ The rise in prescriptions is partly due to an incentive scheme for GPs called the Quality and Outcomes Framework. It means that they can earn extra money for prescribing statins to patients who are seen as high risk for problems such as heart attacks and strokes. Family doctors are urged to try to identify patients who may need the drugs when they come in for their NHS health check – a three-yearly health MOT for those aged 40 to 74. At present, doctors are advised to offer the drugs to anyone with a 20 per cent risk of developing heart disease over the next decade. But next week’s guidelines are expected to lower this threshold to a 10 per cent risk. Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The prescription of cholesterol-lowering medications has been increasing steadily for many years now. ‘This reflects the efforts that have been made to better identify  people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease through  initiatives such as the NHS Health Checks programme. ‘Statins are one of the most studied medicines available today. They have been proven to be safe and effective and are vital in helping reduce people’s risk of heart attack and stroke.’ The figures also revealed that the number of prescriptions for antidepressants has doubled in the last decade, from 27.7million to 53.3million last year. Across the NHS last year, a total of 1.03billion prescriptions were handed out, up by nearly two-thirds in the last decade.","NHS spends £100million a year handing out statins to seven million people .

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter . One in ten inspectors working for the NHS watchdog was hired despite not being up to the job. The Care Quality Commission has admitted that 126 of its staff were recruited through a ‘flawed’ process. They were taken on during a major recruitment drive in 2012 prompted by accusations that the watchdog was failing in its duty to carry out rigorous checks of hospitals and care homes. One in ten inspectors working for the NHS watchdog was hired despite not being up to the job, a new report reveals (file picture) But the CQC has since discovered that during those 12 months the pass rate was lowered and candidates were hired despite under-performing in key assessments. The flaw only came to light in March during a review of the recruitment process, which was prompted by the concerns of other staff. But the watchdog says it cannot sack the inspectors in case they sue for unfair dismissal. The disclosure is the latest blow for the CQC, which has been dogged by scandal since it was set up in 2009 to inspect hospitals, care homes and GP services. The poor recruitment was uncovered by the Health Service Journal, which obtained the review of the process under Freedom of Information laws. It states that during 2012 a total of 134 candidates were appointed as inspectors even though they were subsequently found not to have met certain ‘benchmarks’. A total of 126 remain among the 1,031 full-time inspectors, for whom the starting salary is £38,000. The document adds that throughout 2012, there was a ‘flawed recruitment process’ that resulted in a ‘lowering of the passrate’ of certain assessments. It involved a single assessment day that led to ‘a significant number of people in post who were not recruited to the required standard’. The review admitted that staff were appointed without ‘the core competencies to do the job properly’. The CQC says it cannot get rid of these inspectors as they were unaware of the flawed recruitment process and so could sue for unfair dismissal. It is drastically trying to overhaul its reputation and in 2012 appointed a new chief executive and chairman. They replaced Cynthia Bower and Jo Finney, who were accused of conspiring to cover-up a botched inspection of a maternity unit at Furness General hospital, where poor care contributed to the deaths of mothers and babies. Furness General Hospital, where poor care contributed to the deaths of mothers and babies . Rebecca Prideaux, a former inspector who resigned last year after repeatedly raising concerns over staff to senior managers at the CQC, told the Mail that there were still people ‘at risk’ in the healthcare sector. ‘The CQC keeps promising that it has changed but this shows it is still putting the public at risk. ‘To have 126 inspectors who are in charge of regulating hospitals and care homes who do not meet basic standards is shocking. This means staff who won’t be able to identify risks to patients and care home residents, who don’t have experience of the sector, who are simply substandard. ‘The only way it’s ever going to work is if Jeremy Hunt abolishes it and starts again.’ CQC chief executive David Behan said the recruitment process was now much more rigorous and took place over five days. ‘We now recruit people with specialist experience in healthcare, primary medical services and adult social care. ‘All of our inspection staff, regardless of when they were appointed, receive training, are subject to regular performance management reviews, and their work is quality assured.’","Care Quality Commission says 126 staff were recruited through 'flawed' process .

During a Reddit AMA he told users the first visitors should build up a permanent settlement on Mars. He also admitted he struggles to deal with people who say the moon landings were fake - and admitted he loved his time on the lunar surface. Buzz Aldrin, the lunar module pilot, walking on the surface of the Moon near the leg of the Lunar Module (LM) ""Eagle"" during the Apollo 11 extravehicular activity (EVA). He said that missions to Mars should be one way, and lead to a permanent colony being set up. 'My first words of my impression of being on the surface of the Moon that just came to my mind was 'Magnificent desolation.' The magnificence of human beings, humanity, Planet Earth, maturing the technologies, imagination and courage to expand our capabilities beyond the next ocean, to dream about being on the Moon, and then taking advantage of increases in technology and carrying out that dream - achieving that is magnificent testimony to humanity. But it is also desolate - there is no place on earth as desolate as what I was viewing in those first moments on the Lunar Surface. Because I realized what I was looking at, towards the horizon and in every direction, had not changed in hundreds, thousands of years. Beyond me I could see the moon curving away - no atmosphere, black sky. Cold. Colder than anyone could experience on Earth when the sun is up- but when the sun is up for 14 days, it gets very, very hot. No sign of life whatsoever. That is desolate. More desolate than any place on Earth. 'There is very little doubt, in my mind, that what the next monumental achievement of humanity will be the first landing by an Earthling, a human being, on the planet Mars,' he said. 'And I expect that within 2 decades of the 5th anniversary of the first landing on the moon, that within 2 decades America will lead an international presence on Planet Mars. 'I have considered whether a landing on Mars could be done by the private sector,' he said during the discussion to promote the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, which is on 20 July. 'It conflicts with my very strong idea, concept, conviction, that the first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth. 'They should be the beginning of a build-up of a colony / settlement, I call it a 'permanence'. He also hit back at claims it would be a suicide mission. 'A settlement you can visit once or twice, come back, and then decide you want to settle. 'Same with a colony. 'But you want it to be permanent from the get-go, from the very first. I know that many people don't feel that that should be done. 'Some people even consider it distinctly a suicide mission. Not me! Not at all. 'Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of six to seven years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the moon.' He also hit out at firms offering what he claims amount to tourist trips. 'Tourism trips to Mars and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from Earth – to have an individual company, no matter how smart, send people to mars and bring them back, it is very very expensive. It delays the obtaining of permanence, internationally.' Aldrin also admitted he didn't waste time listening to people who said the moon landings were faked . Aldrin was also asked about conspiracy theorists who say the moon landings were faked. 'I personally don't waste very much of my time on what is so obvious to a really thinking person, of all the evidence – we talked about Carl Sagan recently, who made a very prophetic observation. 'He said that 'extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence to make them believable.' There is not extraordinary evidence of (as far as I know) all the claims that have been made that we did not go to the moon.' He also said he believed alien life exists. 'There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. 'The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. 'It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.' He also hit out at calls for Nasa to return to the moon . 'Returning to the Moon with Nasa astronauts is not the best usage of our resources. Because OUR resources should be directed to outward, beyond-the-moon, to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of Mars that can be built, assembled, from the close-by moons of Mars. 'With very little time delay - a second or less. 'Much better than controlling things on the Moon from the Earth. So when NASA funding comes up for review, please call your lawmakers to support it.' Gravity (2013), starring Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone. 'I thought that the movie Gravity, the depiction of people moving around in zero gravity, was really the best I have seen. 'The free-falling, the actions that took place between two people, were very, I think, exaggerated, but probably bent the laws of physics. 'But to a person who's been in space, we would cringe looking at something that we hoped would NEVER, EVER Happen. 'It's very thrilling for the person who's never been there, because it portrays the hazards, the dangers that could come about if things begin to go wrong, and I think that as I came out of that movie, I said to myself and others, 'Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar.' Aldrin was also asked how the decision was made on who would walk on the moon first. 'I felt that there was an obligation on my part to put forth the reasons why a commander who had been burdened down with an enormous amount of responsibility and training for activities (and because of that, in all previous missions, if someone, a crew member, was to spacewalk, it was always the junior person, not the space commander who would stay inside). We knew this would be different because 2 people would be going out. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to land on the moon, celebrated communion on the heavenly orb . 'There was a group at Nasa who felt the junior person (me) should go out first, but many people felt the great symbology of the commander from past expeditions or arrivals at a destination. 'The decision that was made was absolutely correct as far as who went out first, symbolically. However who was in charge of the what happened after both people are outside, I believe, could have been done differently. 'I was not the commander, I was a junior person, so once both were outside, I followed my leader, because we (NASA) had not put together detailed jobs of people outside. 'I believe it could have been improved. But it was very successful for what it was. 'And the decision wasn't up to me, or Neil, it was up to people much higher up in Nasa.'","Told Reddit AMA first visitors should build up a permanent settlement on Mars .

"By . Mark Prigg . Samsung is set to take on Facebook and Sony with a vitual reality headset. The Gear VR is set to launch later this year. To use it, owners must slot in their Galaxy smartphone to provide the headset with a display and sensors. Samsung's Gear VR is set to launch later this year. To use it, owners must slot in their Galaxy smartphone. 'Today, we can confirm that Samsung is indeed working on a virtual reality device, and it’s called the 'Gear VR', the blog Sammobile said. 'Samsung will be announcing the device, alongside the Galaxy Note 4, at IFA 2014.' Gear VR makes use of the smartphone’s accelerometer, gyroscope and processing power to track head motion, the site said. The gadget can also use the smartphone’s rear-facing camera sensor to supply the user with a video feed of the real outside world, and has a touchpad to allow users to control it. The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. Samsung could be about to enter the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true. The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. It would rival Sony's Project Morpheus headset, pictured . Google's low cost headset is made from corrugated cardboard folded to form a no-frills enclosure. A mobile phone is then slotted in to act as a display. When the headset is put on, lenses in the viewer show images from the screen as a left an right eye image. Using a special app developed by Google, 3d images tand videos can then be viewed. Sources close to Samsung told Engadget the headsets have OLED screens and will connect with the next generation of Galaxy devices. The reports suggest the headset will run on Android, rather than the Tizen operating system most recently seen on Samsung’s latest smartwatches. Engadget added the headset is also likely to connect to a phone or tablet using wires, to prevent a lag when playing games. The release date, price and other features were not revealed, but it does differ from the rumoured Galaxy Glass project, first reported on in October. Variations of virtual reality have been around for years, particularly in flight and driving simulators, but it's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as Oculus VR. Google#'s headset is made from cardboard, and also uses a Mobile Phone as a display . Its Oculus Rift headset began life as a Kickstarter project and was bought by Facebook earlier this year in a deal said to be worth around $2 billion. A consumer version is expected later this year. Samsung was one of the first major companies to launch a smartwatch, after Sony, and is among the pioneers of the curved TV screen industry. Samsung could be hoping to steal a charge against its rivals, including Facebook's Oculus Rift, pictured, and be the first to sell its virtual reality headset to customers . Sony announced its own headset, under Project Morpheus, in March. The adjustable device features a head-mounted display with 1080p HD resolution and a 90-degree field of view, while sensors built into the headset track head movements. In April, Microsoft bought smart glasses specialist Osterhout Design Group and rumours suggest its working on its own augmented and virtual reality gadget for players of the Xbox One.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Fossils of a sparrow-sized creature from China has cast doubts on the commonly held belief that birds evolved from ground-dwelling dinosaurs that slowly gained the ability to fly. It’s long been thought theropods evolved this skill over time, but re-examination of the Scansoriopteryx fossils suggest they may have, instead, been tree-dwelling animals that learnt to glide. Researchers want the creature to be reclassified as an early bird whose ancestors include tree-climbing archosaurs that lived in a time before dinosaurs.

It was previously classified as a coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur, from which many experts believe flying dinosaurs, and later birds, evolved. But new analysis, carried out by Stephen Czerkas of the Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, and Alan Feduccia of the University of North Carolina, suggests otherwise. The research duo used advanced 3D microscopy, high resolution photography and low angle lighting to reveal structures not clearly visible before. These techniques made it possible to interpret the natural contours of the bones. Through their investigations, the researchers found a combination of non-dinosaurian traits along with highly derived features. For example, it had birdlike features such as elongated forelimbs, wing and hind limb feathers, wing membranes in front of its elbow, half-moon shaped wrist-like bones, bird-like perching feet, a tail with short anterior vertebrae. Researchers used advanced 3D microscopy, high resolution photography and low angle lighting to reveal structures not clearly visible before. These include birdlike forelimbs and wing feathers alongside claws that would have made tree climbing possible, and tail vertebrae similar to a Velociraptor (illustration pictured) This reclassification would put Scansoriopteryx in a similar ancestry to the bird-line archosaur Scleromochlus, (artist's illustration pictured) The researchers specifically note the primitive elongated feathers on the forelimbs and hind limbs. However, it was also found to have elongated tendons along its tail vertebrae similar to a Velociraptor, and claws that would have made climbing trees possible. This suggests Scansoriopteryx is an ancestral form of early birds that mastered the basic manoeuvres of parachuting or gliding from trees. The team's findings validate predictions first made in the early 1900's that the ancestors of birds were small, tree-dwelling archosaurs which enhanced their ability to fly with feathers that enabled them to at least glide. This ‘trees down’ view is in contrast with the ‘ground up’ view embraced by many palaeontologists in recent decades that birds derived from terrestrial theropod dinosaurs. ‘The identification of Scansoriopteryx as a non-dinosaurian bird enables a reevaluation in the understanding of the relationship between dinosaurs and birds. Scientists finally have the key to unlock the doors that separate dinosaurs from birds,’ explained Czerkas. Feduccia added, ‘Instead of regarding birds as deriving from dinosaurs, Scansoriopteryx reinstates the validity of regarding them as a separate class uniquely avian and non-dinosaurian.’ The ancestral archosaurs are thought to have originated 250 million years ago, in the late Permian Period. Their descendants, including the dinosaurs, were terrestrial vertebrates for a majority of the Mesozoic Era. The study appears in Springer's Journal of Ornithology.","The Scansoriopteryx, or 'climbing wing', fossil was found in Inner Mongolia .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Despite the differences in the way we look and behave, humans share 99.9 per cent of genetic code with each other. To quantify just how much data is contained within this code - both in the parts we all share, and how we differ - physics engineer Derek Muller applied information theory to the complex nature of DNA. Using binary principles, Muller assigned two bits of information for each molecule in DNA, and converted these bits into bytes to discover the entire code equates to just 1.5GB. Scroll down for video . Human genetic code is contained in a sequence of four molecules, represented by letters A, T, G and C.

When multiplied by 6 billion letters, and divided by eight bits per byte, a physician claims the entire code contains just 1.5GB of data .

According to Muller, the smallest amount of information available is the answer to a ‘yes’ or ‘no’, or ‘true’ or ‘false’ question. In binary code, this can be simplified between a 1, for true, and a 0, for false. In 1963, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) stated there are seven bits of information to encode all of the letters in the alphabet, including upper and lower case letters and symbols. Computers, which need a multiple of two to function due to the binary base of code, began using 8 bits as the unit of computation, and this was called it a byte.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . One of the biggest criticisms of Samsung's plastic devices is they don’t have the high-class, luxury design of the aluminium iPhone 5S. And future models of Apple devices may take this luxury a step further by being entirely encased in glass. The latest Apple patent describes a method of creating glass gadgets by fusing large panes together before filing them into shape. The patent was filed by the Californian firm in January 2012 and awarded yesterday. It describes a method of creating gadgets made of glass by fusing large panes together (pictured) before filing into shape. According to the files, future versions of Apple's devices - including iPhones, iPads, iPods as - could be made more durable . Earlier this month, Apple was awarded a patent that revealed plans to add customisable security options. If implemented, these could, based on a user's location, automatically unlock a phone when the user is in a 'safe' zone. For example, if the device is connected to the user’s home Wi-Fi network. Alternatively, if the phone is on a mobile or public network, security levels could be increased. This could add extra security measures and steps, in addition to the PIN, passcode of fingerprint scanner. The patent was filed by the Californian firm, including senior vice president of design Sir Jony Ive, in January 2012, but wasn't awarded until yesterday. According to the files, titled ‘Fused glass device housings’, future versions of Apple’s electronic devices - including iPhones, iPads, iPods as well as Apple TV - could be made more durable and shatterproof. But, because glass is heavy, the patent describes a system that would fuse panes of glass together, which would then be secured using a chemical strengthening tool. The panes would be larger than the finished model and filed and polished into shape - supposedly to make sure the edges fuse together without fracturing, and without a visible seam. Weak points in the glass would be strengthened using raised glass features and ribs. Spaces for buttons and ports would then be carved into the glass. Apple's Phone 5S (pictured left and right) has an aluminium body and glass panels at the top and bottom of the rear. The iPhone 5C (centre) is plastic . One of the hand-drawn images also revealed this glass could be filed into a curved design, (pictured). The patent explained any glass casings could additionally be tinted to hide internal components . Weak points in the glass would be strengthened using raised glass features and ribs. Spaces for buttons, ports, and any future versions of Apple’s fingerprints scanner would then be carved out of the glass. Glass casings would set Apple devices further apart from its rival Samsung's.

Apple’s Phone 5S currently has an aluminium body and glass panels at the top and bottom of the rear. ‘Electronic devices such as cellular telephones, handheld computers, and portable music players often include housings with glass members,’ explained the patent. ‘For example, a device with a display may have a glass cover that serves as a protective layer. In some devices, a rear housing surface may be formed from a layer of glass. ‘To ensure satisfactory robustness, it is generally desirable to form device housing structures such as cover glass layers and housing surfaces from structures that are sufficiently strong to prevent damage during accidental impact events. ‘Glass strength and device aesthetics can sometimes be enhanced by using sufficiently thick glass layers. ‘However, the size and weight of a device should not be excessive. It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved glass structures for electronic devices.’","The patent was filed by Apple in January 2012 and awarded yesterday .

The cause of the derailment is being investigated. Scroll down for video . The scene pictured after 14 railroad cars derailed in Wytheville, Virginia, on Monday . The three-engine, 33-car train was en route from Louisville to the Port of Virginia with cargo primarily destined for export. Norfolk Southern spokesman Robin Chapman said 12 of the derailed cars were auto carriers while two were double-stack container cars. He could not immediately say what the container cars were hauling. Officials at the scene concluded the cargo was fingernail polish, which is classified as a low-level hazard, Wythe County spokesman Jeremy T.K. Farley said. DEQ staff was on the scene and found 'no evidence of any spills, or any impacts to people's health or environment,' spokesman William Haden wrote in an email.

He said their favourite Travelodge is at Exeter services on the M5 because it has a 'small family feel to it'. Mike added: 'It is beside a motorway, so we certainly weren't attracted to the view.' The couple - who both spent their first honeymoons in Majorca - now live together in Mawnan Smith, near Falmouth, Cornwall. Favourite spot: The couple said they realised a Travelodge may not seem like the most romantic place for a honeymoon, but it was the perfect choice for them . Shakila Ahmed, from Travelodge, said: 'We would like to congratulate Mr and Mrs Sampson on their wedding and to wish them the very best of luck for the future. 'We were delighted to hear that Travelodge has played such an instrumental part in bringing this couple together and has remained a key element throughout their courtship, even including the honeymoon.

Holders Spain could go out if they lose after being thrashed 5-1 by Holland .
Chile beat Australia in their first game and could go through with a win .
Chile have never beaten Spain in their 10 previous encounters (D2 L8).
Spain have won the two previous meetings with Chile at the World Cup: in 1950 (2-0) and in 2010 (2-1). The game in 1950 was played at the Maracanã; which is where this encounter is taking place.
Chile have lost their two previous World Cup games against the defending champion, both against Brazil (in 1962 and 1998).
In their group opener against the Netherlands, Spain conceded 5+ goals in an international for the first time since losing 6-2 to Scotland in June 1963.
Only once before had Spain conceded 5+ goals in a World Cup game (1-6 vs Brazil in Brazil in 1950).
Spain lost their opening game of the 2010 World Cup finals (0-1 v Switzerland) but became the first team to ever lift the World Cup trophy after having lost their opening game of the tournament.
Spain’s 1-5 defeat to the Netherlands was the heaviest margin of defeat by a reigning World Cup champion in the history of the tournament (four goals). The previous heaviest were Brazil losing 0-3 v France in 1998 and West Germany losing 3-6 v France in 1958.
Alexis Sanchez has been involved in seven of the last eight goals that Chile have scored (six assists and one goal).
Spain have not lost back to back internationals since October 2006 (2-3 v Northern Ireland and 0-2 v Sweden).
The Spaniards conceded more goals in 90 minutes against Netherlands (5) than they had in their previous nine international matches combined (4).
Spain have won just one of their last five internationals played at a neutral venue (L2 D2) and that victory was a 2-0 win over El Salvador (FIFA Ranked 68th) in Washington earlier this month."
"By . Travelmail Reporter . Developers have discovered a secret chapel in the ruins of a Scottish castle - and they plan to turn it into a toilet for the rich and famous. The hidden chamber was discovered during preparatory work at Mingary Castle, which is being rebuilt at a cost of more than £2.3m after lying empty for 150 years. The 13th . century castle is expected to become a luxury holiday retreat and the . chapel will be converted into bathrooms, one with a toilet built into an . alcove. Fit for a king: Developers plan to turn the castle into a luxury retreat at a cost of more than £2.3m . Restoration: Planners recently approved a scheme to turn the castle into a luxury holiday home . Secret chamber: The chapel was discovered by developers in the 10ft thick north wall . The chapel was discovered in the 10ft thick north wall. Its windows had been blocked up and part of the room filled in. New plans for the property near Kilchoan, on the most westerly point of the British mainland, show the chamber divided into two bathrooms, one of which has the ‘throne room’ set into a window alcove. Complete refurbishment: The remote castle on the Scottish coast has remained empty for 150 years . Excitement: The chapel's windows had been blocked up and part of the room filled in . Historian Jon Haylett, from Kilchoan, . who was present when the chapel was first discovered, said: 'The north . wall is about three metres thick, it had windows showing from the outside . but there was nothing but a wall on the inside, we knew there had to be . something in there. 'It was quite a job to get into but when the chamber was opened up it was just about magic. 'Even the builders, who I wouldn't describe as men with particularly romantic feelings, were quite emotional. 'Excitement would be absolute understatement to how we were feeling.' Heritage: The castle is protected as a category A listed building . Uncovering the past: Builder Iain MacPhail takes one of the rocks out of the hidden room at Mingary Castle . Remote: The castle is located a mile from the village of Kilchoan in Lochaber, Scotland . Secret . passages and a small room that were sealed up around 500 years ago have . also been discovered during recent restoration work at the castle on the . Ardnamurchan peninsula. It is believed some of the rooms and passageways at the castle were filled in to make the walls more robust following the invention of cannons. A £2.36m . scheme to turn Scotland's best-preserved 13th Century castle into a . luxury holiday home was recently approved by planners. Jon added: 'The first surveys were done in 2011, that was when they learned that the castle needed urgent restoration. Due to the castle’s remote location - a . mile from the village of Kilchoan in Lochaber, Scotland - it has not . been touched since it fell into ruin and was abandoned more than 200 . years ago. The 13th century castle is roughly hexagonal in shape with 9ft-thick walls. Its remains are protected as a category A listed building. Mingary's . position on the seafront meant it held key naval and military . significance and King James IV was said to have used it as a stronghold . for fighting off Clan Donald in the late 15th century. The . castle is owned by Donald Houston, of the Ardnamurchan Estate, who has . asked archaeologists to restore the structure to its former glory at a . cost of £2million. 'Now they've stopped taking things down and they're beginning to build it up again. 'They are starting to look at things like putting in floor joists and lintels and they are working on the chapel.' Mingary Castle - which was once vital to a number of clan chiefs - is badly in need of repair, with the castle's shore walls starting to erode. It is believed that the Lochaber castle has not been inhabited or renovated for over 150 years. The structure is roughly hexagonal in shape . with 9ft-thick walls and it is protected as a . category A listed building. Its position on the seafront meant it . held key naval and military significance and King James IV was said to . have used it as a stronghold for fighting off Clan Donald in the late . 15th century. The huge renovation task is well underway and includes what is described as the biggest scaffolding job in Scotland. Donald Houston, owner of Ardnamurchan Estate which includes the castle, won permission from Highland Council for a reinstatement to residential property, including change of use 'from ruin' to a home, which would be let out. A recent survey showed that, unless urgent restoration work was carried out, the castle was in danger of collapse. The castle restoration - undertaken by the Mingary Castle Preservation and Restoration Trust - has been boosted by the backing of Historic Scotland, in addition to already having charitable status. The scheme has also won scheduled ancient monument consent and it will take another year to complete. So far it has received donations of just over £250,000 towards its restoration bill. Tactical: The castle's position on the seafront meant it held key naval and military significance . A hidden 6ft sq chamber has been also uncovered during the restoration work - it was sealed up during the 16th century and historians admit they don't know what the room was used for . The excavation on parts of the castle has already unearthed a cannonball believed to have been fired more than 350 years ago - discovered embedded in the walls - ammunition, pieces of leather and a medieval bucket in the castle's moat. A tiny chamber measuring 6ft high and 6ft across was also uncovered during the restoration work. Historians have admitted they don't know what the room was used for, and all that has been found inside are a few fragments of bone. The room was discovered when builders found a passageway in the north wall of the building and began excavating it. The trust is trying to raise enough cash to fund the £2.3million venture and has so far raised just over £250,000.

If you want to have a top career you need to give yourself every opportunity to succeed, you want to take every advantage – even being one per cent better than your opposition.

Puffing away: Jack Wilshere was pictured smoking while on holiday in the US . Rising star: Jack Wilshere's progress has been disrupted due to injuries . In the short term, smoking and drinking probably wouldn’t have a major effect on your body. It would be about the quantity and regularity of it. If you smoke over a period of time then that’s not going to do you any good from a fitness point of view and it obviously increases the risk of lung disease. It has a drip-drip effect. If you start young it’s going to have an effect by the time you’re 28 or 29. A sportsperson is no different to the man on the street, the effects are still the same. Laying low: Jack smokes a thin cigar while relaxing in the swimming pool with friends . Bright future: but Wilshere risks cutting his career short if he continues smoking, says Leather . It will damage the lungs and decrease the ability to breathe effectively. With drinking it stays in your system even 48 hours afterwards, which will lead you to be more dehydrated and increase the likelihood of picking up soft tissue injuries if you train or play within that time.

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Ally McCoist insists Sir David Murray is owed an apology from people both ‘in and out of football’ after the ‘needless’ collapse of Rangers in 2012. Last week Murray pointed the finger at the taxman after a judge kicked out HMRC’ s appeal in their long-running case against the Ibrox club. The former owner and chairman said the so-called Big Tax Case case had put off potential buyers and led to Craig Whyte’s disastrous takeover, while fans groups have already called for the SFA, SPFL and other club owners to be held to account over the decision to relegate Rangers when they went bust. Leader: Rangers boss Ally McCoist with players Lee McCulloch (left) and Richard Foster . Still got it: McCoist kicks a ball around during training in California . On Tuesday McCoist said he would ‘never forget’ the role played by leading figures in and around the Scottish game in his club’s descent into financial meltdown. As he called for answers from those he believes are truly responsible for his club’s demise, however, the Rangers boss conceded he won’t be holding his breath for any inquiry or apologies from those involved in the saga. Speaking from his club’s pre-season training base in California, McCoist said: ‘Do people have serious questions to answer? One hundred per cent. I don’t know if I would use the word witch-hunt. But I would definitely say there are certain people that I would hope David Murray would get some answers from in high-up places – both in and out of the game. ‘But I’ll tell you right now - I don’t think we would get an enquiry. And I would be very, very doubtful if David Murray would get an apology from certain people either. ‘But it leaves, at best, a very, very bad taste in my mouth and in the mouths of a lot of people at Rangers when you think of what has happened to this club. ‘It needn’t have happened and it’s horrendous – and I will never forget some of the things which have been said and done to our club by people who should have known better.’ Owed: McCoist believes that former Ranger's chief Sir David Murray deserves an apology . Meltdown: Craig Whyte, who took over from Murray, led the club to the point of ruin . An under-pressure Murray sold Rangers to Craig Whyte for a token £1 in May 2011 at a time when the club was in dispute with HMRC over an Employee Benefit Trust scheme set up a decade before. Rangers subsequently plummeted into administration in February 2012 after the Whyte regime failed to pay tax totalling £14million. HMRC rejected proposals that could have prevented the Ibrox oldco from being liquidated and ultimately demoted to League Two, but the tax man went on to lose the original First Tier Tribunal on the EBT case by a majority verdict in November 2013. HMRC lost an appeal against that verdict last week.","McCoist says Murray is owed an apology after 'needless' Rangers collapse .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . British holidaymakers seeking to make the most of their money while abroad should point their travel plans in the direction of the United States, according to new figures. The exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar is currently at a five-year high in favour of British currency – and tourists with an eye for bargains are being urged to cross the Atlantic while the situation holds. Grab them while you can: The pound is currently trading at a five-year high against the US dollar . While the current rate falls short of the high tide of two dollars to the pound that was available before the financial crisis of 2008, savvy travellers can now expect to receive $1.70 for £1 – which will make for great deals in places such as New York. British Airways has compiled a list of luxury items which are potentially a little more affordable thanks to the current weakness of the dollar – including high-end jewellery, expensive trainers and computer technology. A Tiffany Harmony engagement ring, for example, costs from £10,300 in the UK, but is available from $12,700 in the United States, a price difference which, thanks to the exchange rate, currently equates to a saving of £2,823 – 27 per cent less. A pair of Nike Dunk High Be True ID trainers, meanwhile, retail at £95 in the sportswear giant’s London store, but would cost $135 in New York – a drop of £39.07 (41 per cent). Big destinations, big savings: British travellers can expect more for their money in both New York and Dubai . And an iPad Air (16GB), which retails at £399 at the Apple Store on London’s Regent Street, costs $499 at the same shop on Fifth Avenue in the Big Apple – a figure which, when the strength of the pound is considered, translates to a saving of £106 (26 per cent). ‘The pound has been growing stronger over the past year, meaning that there are deals to be had on travel money,’ says Mark Horgan of currency specialists Moneycorp. ‘The current strength of the pound is making holidaying abroad an attractive option, particularly when buying US dollars.’ Price-conscious tourists are also being advised that, because the US dollar is often used as a marker currency, several other destinations have also become far cheaper. ‘What British holidaymakers may not have considered is that there are other currencies promising great exchange rates due to their relationship with the dollar,’ Mr Horgan adds. ‘We are seeing that the spending power of British holidaymakers and travellers has increased in the countries where the currency is pegged to the US dollar. ‘In fact, their travel money will go 10 per cent further than this time last year. Beach bargains: Because the East Caribbean Dollar is pegged to its US counterpart, Antigua is also cheaper . ‘While now is certainly a great time to visit the US, it is also a great time to book a trip to the Caribbean or Dubai.’ Some 21 currencies – including the Barbadian dollar, the East Caribbean dollar, the Hong Kong dollar and the United Emirati dirham – are all pegged to the US dollar. This means that budget-stretching breaks for Britons are currently available from the stylish hotels of Kowloon to the resorts of Sharjah via the sandy beaches of Antigua. Specifically, eight different countries use the East Caribbean dollar – opening up the prospect of extra value for your holiday money if you are currently planning a trip to any of Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Anguilla and Montserrat.","British pound is currently floating at a five-year high against the US dollar .

"By . Alex Greig . An extremely rare coin, the first of its kind to be minted in the United States, has sold at auction in Florida for more than $4.5 million. The 1787 Brasher doubloon has been called the most valuable coin in the world, and the price it fetched at auction - $4,582,500 - paid by an anonymous bidder, confirms that. The coin, the first of its kind, was made by a silversmith named Ephraim Brasher who lived next door to George Washington after the Revolutionary War at 1 Cherry St on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Four million dollar coin: The legendary Brasher doubloon features a rising sun on its front . Reverse: The back of the coin features Ephraim Brasher's initials on the wing of the eagle . He created the Brasher doubloon in 1787. According to Heritage Auctions, the design on the front of the coin was adopted from the New York coat of arms - a sun rising of the peak of a mountain with a body of water in the foreground. Brasher's name is spelled out below the waves in small letters and the words around the edge of the coin say NOVA EBORACA COLUMBIA EXCELSIOR - New York, America, Ever Higher. Excelsior remains the state motto to this day. On the reverse, an eagle with wings outspread, a shield covering its body and an 'EB' stamp over one of the wings. It has an olive branch in its claw and 13 stars surrounding its head. Around the edge of the coin is the legend 'UNUM E PLURIBUS,' which translates as 'one of many.' The coin measures 28.6mm and weighs 26.66 grams and is 89 per cent gold, six per cent silver and three per cent copper. It contained about $16 worth of gold, which in the late 18th century was a not insignificant amount of money. Pop culture: The Brasher doubloon was the subject of a Raymond Chandler mystery novel (left) which in turn became a film (right) It has been called the most valuable and most important coin in the world. 'The legendary Brasher Doubloon is one of the most important coins in American history because it's the first gold coin struck for the young United States and it's one of only a handful that exist,' said Todd Imhof, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions. The doubloon hasn't been offered for sale since it was bought by a Chicago resident in 1979 for $430,000. The coin was at the center of the plot of a 1942 Raymond Chandler novel called The High Window, which was later adapted into a film noir and called The Brasher Doubloon. The novel was a Philip Marlowe mystery about the fictional theft of the Brasher doubloon. It was purchased during the U.S. Coin Signature Auction last week at Florida's United Numismatics Convention in Orlando.","The Brasher doubloon has sold at auction for $4,582,500 .

People in the crowd shouted that he . should shoot Nato or the EU, both of which are blamed for preventing the . Bosnian Serbs winning their country’s brutal civil war between 1992 and . 1995. Milorad Dodik, the president of Serbian half of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then unveiled the two-metre-high bronze statue yesterday. 'Gavrilo Princip was a freedom fighter and the Austro Hungarian empire was an occupier here,' he said. 'People who live here have never been on the same side of history and are still divided. 'We are sending different messages and . that says it all about this country which is being held together by . international violence.' Bosnian people gathered to touch or kiss the statue of Gavrilo Princip, who they consider a freedom fighter . The blood-soaked undershirt Franz Ferdinand was wearing on the day he was assassinated is also on display at the Museum of Military History in Vienna . Archduke Franz Ferdinand's blood-soaked uniform is one of the star attractions at the Museum of Military History in Vienna . In the Bosnian Serb East Sarajevo they . have a different view of Bosnia's future: to divide the country so that . the Serb part can join neighbouring Serbia. Underlining this division, at the . other end of Sarejevo, which is controlled by the Muslim and Croat . federation, the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra will play an EU-sponsored . performance. It is planned as both salute to . European integration and a symbolic start of a new century of peace . where the emperor’s heir was killed on June 28, 1914. The assassination, which symbolically . took place on the Serbian Orthodox Church’s St Vitus Day, led the Austro . Hungarian empire to declare war on neighbouring Serbia. And, thanks to a series of alliances, . Europe’s major powers were all dragged into fighting an unimaginably . bloody conflict that led to the slaughter of 16million people. Yet what was really behind the war . were the dark aspirations of Germany – which despite its greater . military and industrial might – was an imperial minnow. Ceremony: Members of Bosnian Tripartite Presidency Nebojsa Radmanovic, left, President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik, center, and local mayor Ljubisa Cosic, right, uncover the statue of Gavrilo Princip . Gavrilo Princip, who is considered a hero among Serbs in Bosnia . Germany, which erroneously believed . Britain would remain neutral if it invaded France, essentially wanted to . shift the balance of power in its favour. Its military chiefs planned for a . swift and crushing blow against France in which its army would reach . Paris before the French or British had fully mobilized their troops. But the conflict - characterised by . the stalemate of trench war and of lions led by donkeys as they were . machine-gunned down for a few inches of land – would last until 1918. The war, which pitted also pitted . Russia, Italy and ultimately the United States against Germany, . Austro-Hungary and Turkey, changed the face of the continent. Ultimately, the British and French were victorious, but the German army was never defeated militarily. Rather, their countrymen were being . starved to death at home and the entrance of the U.S. in 1917 made the . Allies look unbeatable. This sense of a cheated military . outcome – combined with harsh reparations ordered by France – is argued . by many historians to have been a cause of World War Two. Mounting Russian casualties during WWI . also led to a Communist dictatorship that led to the deaths of millions . in purges and careless tactics in the following war. Yet all these tragic events might have . been avoided if Franz Ferdinand’s chauffeur hadn’t driven the wrong way . back on June 28, 1914. Driver Leopold Loyka made a wrong turn . past Sarajevo’s Schiller’s deli, where forlorn gunman Gavrilo Princip . was dining after his earlier assassination plan failed. The Serb leapt out of the café and . seized his chance – and wwo bullets later, both Franz Ferdinand and . Princess Sophie, who was shot as she tried to cover her husband, lay . dead. Franz Ferdinand was sitting in the back of this car with his wife Sophie when they were shot dead by assassins in Sarajevo one hundred years ago . The car's bodywork was pierced by incoming rounds as the Archduke and his wife lay mortally wounded . Where the tide of history turned: Tourists gathered on Friday around a replica of the Graf & Stift car that Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia were riding in when they were assasinated by Princip - and at the spot where it happened, in front of the museum in downtown Sarajevo .

"By . Peter Allen . French president Francois Hollande visited his estranged first lady Valerie Trierweiler over the weekend to discuss her future, an aide has claimed. Miss Trierweiler left hospital in Paris on Saturday after reportedly overdosing on sleeping pills, and is now ‘resting’ at the president’s country house in Versailles. The source claimed that the pair arranged a meeting to have ‘words’ on the weekend, before Mr Hollande was due to leave on an official trip abroad today - La Lanterne. Francois Hollande, an avowed left winger who ‘dislikes the rich’, was set to visit his estranged first lady Valerie Trierweile to ‘discuss their future’ in one of the most opulent homes in Europe . Sources at Paris Match – where . Trierweiler has worked for more than two decades – say the president . feels he needs more time before choosing between her and his lover Julie . Gayet, 41. However one . of Mr Hollande’s aides confirmed yesterday that his relationship with . 48-year-old Miss Trierweiler was ‘over’ – and she will be asked to move . out of the presidential homes, including the Elysee. Mr . Hollande is expected to publicise a decision about Miss Trierweiler’s . future before he leaves for a scheduled visit to the USA in February. Meanwhile . Miss Trierweiler made her first direct public comment about the scandal . on Saturday, tweeting: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all . those who have sent messages of support wishing me a speedy recovery. Very touched.’ While . Miss Trierweiler has indicated she is prepared to forgive and forget . following revelations of his affair with an actress, her furious uncle . Florent Massonneau said: ‘I think the fact my niece is being cuckolded . is disgraceful. Her situation gives us a lot of pain.’ It came as a new poll revealed that 77 per cent of  French people are ‘dissatisfied’ with Hollande’s presidency. Today such figures were expected to rise, as the growing crisis was set to be played out in La Lanterne. Built for the bodyguard of the pre-Revolutionary monarch Louis XVI, it has long been viewed by the left as a symbol of unacceptable wealth and privilege. Valerie Trierweiler left hospital in Paris on Saturday after reportedly overdosing on sleeping pills, and is now 'resting' at the president's country house in Versailles . As well as a heated swimming pool, tennis court and manicured gardens, it contains one of the best wine cellars in France, and its own manicured gardens . As well as a heated swimming pool, tennis court and manicured gardens, it contains one of the best wine cellars in France, and its own manicured gardens. Despite having her own flat in Paris, Ms Trierweiler, 48, was driven to the the magnificent presidential home on Saturday afternoon after spending eight days in private hospital room suffering from stress. It was caused by hearing about Mr Hollande’s secret two year affair with the film and TV actress Julie Gayet, 41. As Ms Gayet remained in hiding, a  source close to the president confirmed that he ‘planned to see’ Ms Trierweiler today, and that he and the first lady would be ‘discussing their future’. Mr Hollande only saw Ms Trierweiler once in hospital, and even then only after she had been at the Pitie-Salpetriere for more than a week. President Hollande has been accused of having an affair with 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet . The leader is due to reveal whether Ms Trierweiler will continue in her role as the First Lady next month . Ms Trierweiler is desperately trying to hang on to her role, despite clear indications that Mr Hollande wants to make Ms Gayet his first lady. In an attempt to drum up public support, Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter on Saturday night to write: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all those who sent messages of support ... very touched’. Her words were met with an avalanche of ridicule, with people describing her as everything from ‘the Rottweiler’ to the new Marie-Antoinette, after the high-living wife of Louis XVI who was eventually guillotined. A new Ifop/idd poll in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reveals 37 per cent of France is ‘very discontented’ with Hollande’s presidency, and 40 per cent are simply ‘discontented’. Mr Hollande visited his political heartland of Correze, in central France, on Saturday, but again refused to answer questions about who his real first lady was. Instead Bernard Combes, the Socialist mayor of Combes – a job Mr Hollande had for seven years – said: ‘France's political situation requires all of the president's attention and all of his time, so obviously it would be best for everyone if he can resolve the problems in his personal life under good conditions.’ The French President greeted constituents in Tulle as the scandal surrounding his alleged infidelities continues .

"By . Tara Brady . Nigella Lawson is believed to have had her U.S. travel ban overturned and is looking forward to filming the next series of The Taste . Nigella Lawson is believed to have had her U.S. travel ban overturned after it was imposed following her courtroom drug confession. It means the TV star will be allowed to fly to America this year to film the next series of The Taste. The 54-year-old has already put a call out on Twitter for aspiring chefs to apply for the show. It is understood work on the third series will start in the autumn. Lawson was forced to abandon a trip to America in April after she was stopped from boarding a British Airways flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles. It came after the Domestic Goddess admitted during a fraud trial that she had taken cocaine on two occasions. U.S. officials can stop foreigners who have committed drugs offences entering the country even if they have never been arrested and charged by police. Channel 4 has still not confirmed whether the UK's version of The Taste will be recommissioned due to poor ratings. A source told The People: 'It has been a torrid year for Nigella but now things are starting to come together. 'She is happy about this. She can now continue her role on The Taste, something she enjoys immensely.' Last July, Lawson divorced art collector Charles Saatchi after he was photographed grabbing her throat outside Scott's Restaurant, in Mayfair, central London. In December she testified at the fraud trial of two former aides Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo. Nigella Lawson is said to be looking forward to filming the next series of The Taste in America this autumn . During the trial she said: 'I've never been a drug addict, I've never been a habitual user. There are two occasions in my life when I used cocaine.' According to Lawson, she took the drug with her late husband John Diamond who was terminally ill with cancer and who died in 2001. Police later said they would not investigate the matter any further. Sisters Francesca Grillo (left) and Elisabetta Grillo arrive at Isleworth Crown Court last December. During the trial Nigella Lawson admitted using cocaine on two occasions . Nigella Lawson (left) and Charles Saatchi (right) arrive at Isleworth Crown Court last year during the fraud trial . At the time Lawson's co-host on The Taste, chef Anthony Bourdain, tweeted that he was 'absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of U.S. actions' over Lawson's travel. Bourdain said in an email that Lawson was 'the most focused, non-party, sober person I know. How this could happen — to her, of all people — is beyond me.' She is not the first British celebrity to fall afoul of U.S. immigration officials. In 2008 the late singer Any Winehouse, who had a marijuana arrest and well-publicised problems with alcohol and drugs, was refused a visa to perform at the Grammy Awards. Singer Lily Allen was denied a visa the same year, shortly after she was arrested over an altercation with photographers. The MailOnline has contacted Nigella Lawson's agent and is awaiting a comment.","The TV star will be allowed to fly to America this year .

"By . Ian Drury . Turned? Western security officials believe Snowden has become a Russian informant out of fear . Edward Snowden put British agents’ lives at risk, it was claimed yesterday, as it was alleged he spied for Russia while in the U.S. Intelligence chiefs believe the whistleblower is passing secrets to Vladimir Putin in return for sanctuary. Snowden, 30, became one of the world’s most wanted men last June when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents from the US National Security Agency. He leaked details of attempts by state spy agencies – including Britain’s GCHQ – to illegally view citizens’ private information. He claimed internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords were harvested. Snowden also made the highly damaging revelation that the U.S. had hacked Chinese computers and the communications of allies such as Germany and France. The defence contractor, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in U.S. history, on a par with WikiLeaks whistleblower Bradley Manning. NSA executive Rick Ledgett, in charge of assessing the damage, said the stolen files contained ‘the keys to the kingdom’. MI5 director general Andrew Parker called it a ‘gift to terrorists’. Snowden claims he acted after becoming convinced the US  government’s actions were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Moscow, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location. Sensitive material: General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in March that many of the documents contained highly sensitive material relating to national security . Exploitation: It is claimed that Russian president Vladimir Putin (left) has . 'sought to exploit Snowden (right) and he will continue to do so until he feels . that he has reached his max on that' Much of the stolen information was . revealed by the Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post. But there . are mounting suspicions Snowden had been recruited – unwittingly or not – . by foreign agents. Intelligence chiefs believe he is now a ‘puppet’ passing details of military capabilities, operations and tactics to . Putin’s henchmen, although he denies taking any classified material to . Russia.

A Western intelligence source . said: ‘We believe the Russians have got more information from him, which . is the reason why they are allowing him to stay.’ Richard Bejtlich, a . former US military intelligence agent, said: ‘The debate is, was he . working for the Chinese or the Russians and he may not even have known . he was doing that?

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the levy would be ratcheted up for the most expensive properties . Owners of multi-million pound homes will be hit hardest by Labour’s mansion tax, Ed Balls vowed today. The shadow chancellor insisted people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge aimed at properties worth £2million or more. But he promised to hike the levy for homes with over £10million, to ensure they make a ‘significantly bigger contribution’. Labour has joined the Liberal Democrats in promising an extra charge on expensive properties, to target rich homeowners – especially wealthy foreigners who buy up properties in London. The move has been seen as an attempt by Labour to woo the Lib Dems in the event of another hung parliament leading to a coalition with Nick Clegg’s party. Today Mr Balls gave more detail of the scheme, but still failed to put a figure on how much the charge will be. Writing in the Standard, he said: ‘How can it be right that the foreign buyer last month of a £140 million flat in Westminster will pay just £26 a week in council tax — the same as the average-value property in that council area?’ Under the details announced today, the £2million limit will rise in line with property prices, instead of inflation ‘to ensure that more modest properties are not brought into the scope of the tax’. Nationwide prices are up 8 per cent year-on-year, while in London prices have risen 18.7 per cent in the last 12 months. There will also be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings, but who live in an expensive home. This is likely to apply to widows or families who have lived in the same property for many years. Mr Balls promised a ‘relief scheme’ which could include allowing those on modest incomes to defer payment until the property is sold. The mansion tax will also be ratcheted up on the most expensive properties, so the wealthiest pay most. Egerton Crescent, in London's Kensington, where the average house is worth more than £7million . The Lib Dems used to argue in favour of a 1 per cent charge on the value of any home worth more than £2million, but there are concerns it would be difficult to implement. Labour would introduce ‘bands’, similar to those used for council tax, with a higher charge on the biggest houses. Mr Balls said: ‘The tax must be progressive so that those with properties worth tens of millions of pounds make a significantly bigger contribution than those in houses just above the limit. ‘But it must also be administratively simple. The original proposal by the Liberal Democrats for a one per cent annual charge on the value of the house above £2 million would require detailed valuations each year and fails that test. ‘I believe a better way would be to use a banded system, which avoids the need for detailed annual valuations.’ It could be modelled on a banded system introduced by the coalition government o target properties bought through companies to reduce tax. It groups homes together in bands: £2-£5 million, £5-10 million, £10-20 million and over £20 million.","Shadow chancellor promises to ratchet up charge on highest value houses .

Workers harvesting bluefin tuna from Maricultura's tuna pens near Ensenada, Mexico . Bluefin are the largest tuna and can live up to 40 years. They migrate across oceans and can dive more than 4,000 feet. Bluefin tuna are made for speed: built like torpedoes, have retractable fins and their eyes are set flush to their body. They are tremendous predators from the moment they hatch, seeking out schools of fish like herring, mackerel and even eels. They hunt by sight and have the sharpest vision of any bony fish. There are three species of bluefin: Atlantic (the largest and most endangered), Pacific, and Southern. Most catches of the Atlantic bluefin tuna are taken from the Mediterranean Sea, which is the most important bluefin tuna fishery in the world. The Atlantic bluefin is a highly sought-after delicacy for sushi and sashimi in Asia—a single fish has sold for over $1.75 million! Driven by such high prices, fishermen use even more refined techniques to catch tuna. And the fish are disappearing as a result. Although tuna do provide food and livelihoods for people, they are more than just seafood. Tuna are a top predator in the marine food chain, maintaining a balance in the ocean environment. In the Mediterranean, WWF has been working for over 10 years to protect Atlantic bluefin tuna. We work to stop overfishing and ensure recovery of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock. WWF has been very influential in most of the decisions made by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the body that regulates the fisheries. - WorldWildlife.Org .","Menu also features foie gras, rissotto with carbineros prawns and saffron .

"By . James Rush . It was meant to be a light-hearted attempt to sell garden furniture. But advertisers working for the Swedish furniture giant Ikea clearly underestimated the sensitivities of British gnome lovers. When their TV campaign showed a line up of the garden ornaments being systematically destroyed they received dozens of angry complaints. Scroll down for video . Ikea's recent 'Say no to Gnomes' advert has prompted an angry response from some television viewers . The Advertising Standards Authority has received 50 complaints from concerned viewers in relation to the advert . The advert shows a married couple 'killing off' an invasion of angry garden gnomes in a range of increasingly violent ways . The advert shows a family replacing their old garden decorations with new products from Ikea. Angered at plans to eradicate them from the garden, the gnomes launch a revenge attack. But they are thwarted by the couple – who find increasingly violent ways to kill them off. Some are shattered into thousands of pieces by a well-aimed jet from a power hose while others are gathered in a hammock and smashed against a garden fence. One scene sees a heartbroken gnome standing over a fallen friend with a tear running down his cheek. The ad finishes with the tagline: ‘Make more of your garden. Say no to gnomes.’ The gnomes rebel against the new additions at the married couple's home in the Ikea advert . Viewers complaining about the advert have said it is 'unsuitable for children, offensive, frightening, violent and encourages anti-social behaviour' However the company found themselves on the end of an unlikely backlash – after affronted viewers picked up the phone to criticise the ‘violent’ attack. Around 50 people rang the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to complain about the ad’s ‘frightening and unsuitable’ content. An ASA spokesman said  they realised some people found the images distressing. However he said the ASA would not be taking further action. ‘We do not share the view that it would encourage violence, condone anti-social behaviour or upset children,’ he said. Last night Dr Twigs Way, a garden gnome expert, said: ‘Gnomes have always played a large and happy part in populating our green spaces. ‘People like to make out that they’re naff and tacky, but they are a lucky charm, which are now loved worldwide. 'The advert was bound to cause uproar. After all, we are a nation of gnome lovers. If I were Ikea I’d be . worried. Beware the revenge of the little folk.’ Ikea’s marketing manager Peter Wright said: ‘We believe that the advert takes a light-hearted approach. ‘We can confirm that no gnomes were . harmed in the making of the advert, thanks to clever CGI post-production . and some brave stunt doubles.’ Ikea has said the advert takes a 'light-hearted approach' to show how easy it is to treat gardens like any other room in the home .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman is using social media to document her life with actor Bradley Cooper - in the form of a cardboard cutout. Danielle Davies, 39, decided that if she couldn't spend her life with the Hollywood star, then she would 'just make one up'. She's taken to Instagram and has set up a website to . share pictures of Bradley doing chores and running errands with her . including mowing the lawn, doing the dishes and shopping, all while . dressed in a tasteful tux. Good night Bradders: The fact is, while most of us don't actually live our lives with movie stars, many of us wish we did, writes Danielle Davies . You think I'd look good in this? Danielle actually met Cooper during her sophomore year at Villanova University when they were in a play together . Pick that up would you Bradley? Davies said she started working on the project, which will also be a book, to show 'how our lives continued to have these weird parallels but are ultimately nothing alike' The mum-of-two, from New Jersey, said she picked Bradley because she actually went to college with The Hangover star. Danielle said: 'I picked Bradley Cooper because I went to college with him for one year and we were in a play together, so I've watched his career from the get-go. 'The fact is, while most of us don't actually live our lives with movie stars, many of us wish we did. 'And so, being a forward-thinking American, I have taken the bull by the horns, the horse by the reigns, the cardboard cutout of Bradley Cooper by the shoulders, and just pretended that I do. 'If I want a life with Bradley Cooper, well, then...I'll just make one up.' Running the red carpet: She said the pictures are 'a way for me to poke fun at how I ended up where I am and how/why my one-time stage equal has gone on to become an Academy Award nominee' Pushing it: On her site, Davies gives a shout out to her family, including Ed, 'possibly the most patient husband in the world and relatively uninterested participant in these photos' Davies, who counts Limitless and Silver Linings Playbook among her favorites of the actor's films, said she's never heard from Cooper or anyone in his camp . She's even got her kids and husband Ed in on the action - although her daughter keeps confusing Bradley with Mark Wahlberg. 'My husband is totally supportive and thinks it's funny. Weirdly, some of his friends ask him if he's ok with it, as if I'm hanging out around town with a real life Bradley Cooper instead of a cardboard version. 'My kids think it's fun but get a little impatient with it sometimes, especially if they think I'm not doing something they want me to do. Then they're like 'It's Bradley Cooper this and Bradley Cooper that!' 'My daughter is young enough to not realize it might be embarrassing - I even took him to her school. My son would be mortified if I did that to him!' Tucking him in: Daneille says that she and Cooper have some 'mutual friends, friends of friends,' so she's sure he'll eventually hear about her project . Good father: Her daughter keeps referring to Bradley Cooper as Mark Wahlberg but she is in on the fun . Who am I to buck the system? If I want a life with Bradley Cooper, well, then¿I¿ll just make one up', Danielle says . She added: 'When I first unfold him, people are definitely looking at me like I'm crazy. I'm so grateful my friend, Kiesha Bond, the photographer, comes with me everywhere so I don't look like the only crazy person.'Anyway, most people end up asking what we're doing and then they love it and it's totally comfortable. The weirdest is when people don't say anything and just avert their eyes - how can you not ask?' Danielle is currently working on a book about her unusual project and added that Bradley has in 'no way endorsed, sponsored or participated in this ridiculousness.' A disclaimer on Danielle's website states: 'Bradley Cooper was not harmed in the taking of these photos. Nor was he consulted.' But what would she say to the man himself? 'What would I say to Bradley? Um...hi?' Dressed to impress: Danielle has been posting photos of her family and Cooper since April . All the fun of the fair with you: Danielle insists that no Bradley Coopers were harmed in the taking of the photos. Also, he doesn¿t know about the account . Danielle writes, 'Fortunately, Brad is a total gentleman. Unfortunately, I'm still roasting. And things are only going to get worse without air conditioning in the VW' 'Who would have thought that Bradley Cooper could be so silly? Sure enough, it was his idea to take these pics the other day while we were strolling Asbury Avenue in New Jersey. He is hysterical!' says Danielle .","Danielle Davis, 39, has pictures of herself with the star in all manner of poses .

"By . Corey Charlton . The new King and Queen of Spain have continued their public relations blitz with yet another high profile appearance since they took the throne. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain today visited an Air Force basic academy in Leon, northern Spain, to oversee a military graduation ceremony. It was the latest in a series of high profile public appearances the couple have made since they were crowned King and Queen last month. The two arrived well dressed for the occasion - Felipe VI wore a full military outfit, while the Queen was elegantly dressed in black trousers - and a rather royal looking top. King Felipe VI looked right at home dressed in his full military attire. The couple have been busy since they were sworn in making a series of high profile appearances . Queen Letizia has forged a name for herself as something of a fashion icon in Spain, with the mother of two's dress sense followed closely by the public and the press . The couple only took power last month and in accordance with the Spanish Constitution, as Monarch, King Felipe is commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces . The official graduation ceremony took place at the military airfield Virgen Del Camino in Spain, where hundreds of graduates got to celebrate with their new King . Monarchists hope the era only just under way for the new King and Queen will usher in a new era of popularity for the troubled royal household. Determined to stay in line with the country's austerity measures, the couple and their two daughters - Leonor, eight, and Sofia, seven - held a low-key affair ceremony after which there was a brief military parade to their first official engagement. It was a sharp contrast to the pomp expected when compared with royal handovers in other countries, to show an appreciation for the fact that more than one in four Spanish workers is jobless despite an incipient economic recovery. King Felipe's signing in was more of a legal process, attended by lawmakers, high-level politicians and some members of the royal family - including his new Queen - with no foreign leaders invited. King Felipe and Spain face plenty of problems. The country is struggling to shrug off a double-dip recession and drive down its 26 percent jobless rate. Scandals have tarnished the royal family and fueled campaigns to abolish the monarchy, while influential groups in some Spanish regions continue to push hard for independence. As soon as he had begun his reign, he has sought to draw a line under Spain's recent past, promising 'a reinvigorated monarchy for new times' and declared his intention to restore trust in the monarchy. He told crowds in his first public statement as King he felt the suffering of those whose living standards were hurt by the economic crisis. He urged Spaniards to shun resignation and unleash their ambitions and said finding jobs for the unemployed was 'a priority for society and the government.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Tony Blair was told he was a ‘fool’ to convert to Catholicism by protestant leader Ian Paisley. The founder of the Free Presbyterian Church and long-time critic of the papacy in Rome made clear his unhappiness with the former Prime Minister’s decision to join the Catholic church. Mr Blair has said his decision was fuelled by his wife Cherie winning the battle over where the couple should go to Mass. Tension: Protestant leader Rev Ian Paisley called Tony Blair a 'fool' for converting to Catholicism . Mr Blair has suggested that switching to Catholicism in 2007 was like 'coming home' and is 'where my heart is.' But he received a frosty reception from Rev Paisley, the former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,  with whom he often discussed religion. Mr Blair said he wanted to tell the former Northern Ireland First Minister in person about his decision, even though he knew he would be unhappy about it. But Rev Paisley dismissed him with a four-word response and walked off. The encounter on the day Mr Blair formally joined the Catholic church emerged in a new BBC documentary about Rev Paisley’s career in politics. The pair were leaving a private meeting in 2007 when Mr Blair revealed his plans. Rev Paisley said: ‘As we were walking down the stairs he stopped, he looked back at me and he said “Ian there is something I need to tell you”. As Norther Ireland's First Minister and Britain's Prime Minister, the two men often discussed religion . ‘”When the hands of that clock”, and he pointed to a big clock that was on the wall, “When the hands of that clock, when they come to eight o'clock I will be a Roman Catholic”. ‘And he said “I didn't want you to leave without telling you, I'd rather tell you myself”. ‘And I said “You are a fool” and I walked on.’ Dr Paisley claimed Mr Blair's grandmother had urged him against ever marrying someone from the Roman Catholic faith or converting himself. Mr Blair married Catholic lawyer Cherie Booth in 1980 and converted to Catholicism in 2007. Religious division between Catholic and Protestant communities fuelled much of the unrest and tensions of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The issue of Mr Blair’s religion became so sensitive that his spin doctor Alastair Campbell once declared: ‘We don’t do God.’ But after leaving office in June 2007, he began his preparations to become Catholic. In 2009 Mr Blair told a religious conference in Italy: 'Frankly this all began with my wife. 'I began to go to Mass and we went together. We could have gone to the Anglican or Catholic church - guess who won? 'As time went on, I had been going to Mass for a long time... it's difficult to find the right words. I felt this was right for me. There was something, not just about the doctrine of the Church, but of the universal nature of the Catholic Church. 'Ever since I began preparations to become a Catholic I felt I was coming home and this is now where my heart is, where I know I belong.' Mr Blair and wife Cherie arrive at a service in memory of Pope John Paul II at London's Westminster Cathedral after converting to Catholicism . In the BBC documentary, Dr Paisley was asked what his reaction would be if one of his own family came home with a Catholic. ‘I would have bought a long cane and have given him a few strokes with it,’ he joked. But he then added: ‘I would have said “Let us sit down and ask God his opinion on this” and I would have said “Although you hurt me doing what you are doing, you are my child and my love is greater than my hurt”. ‘And they could come in and out of this house as they would, they would not have been put out by me or my wife either.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . The rate of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is falling in the United States and some other rich countries, new  research shows. An American over age 60 today has a 44 percent lower chance of developing dementia than a similar-aged person did roughly 30 years ago, the longest study of these trends in the U.S. concluded. Dementia rates also are down in Germany, a study there found. However, the epidemic is still growing simply because more people are living to an old age. Good news: The rate of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is falling in the United States and some other rich countries, new  research shows (stock photo) 'For an individual, the actual risk of dementia seems to have declined,' said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a University of Michigan expert on aging who discussed the studies Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Copenhagen. He said the decrease is probably due to more education and control of health factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure. The opposite is occurring in some poor countries that have lagged on education and health, where dementia seems to be rising. More than 5.4 million Americans and 35 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. It has no cure and current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms. A drop in rates is a silver lining in the so-called silver tsunami - the expected wave of age-related health problems from an older population. Alzheimer's will remain a major public health issue, but countries where rates are dropping may be able to lower current projections for spending and needed services, experts said. Recent studies from the Netherlands, Sweden and England have suggested a decline, and the new research extends this look to some other parts of the world. Decline: The federally funded Framingham study, pictured, tracked new dementia cases among several thousand people 60 and older in five-year periods starting in 1978, 1989, 1996 and 2006 and noted a decline . In the U.S., the federally funded . Framingham study tracked new dementia cases among several thousand . people 60 and older in five-year periods starting in 1978, 1989, 1996 . and 2006. Compared with the first period, new cases were 22 percent . lower in the second one, 38 percent lower in the third and 44 percent . lower in the fourth one. The average age at which dementia was diagnosed also rose - from 80 during the first period to 85 in the last one. During that time, there were declines in smoking, heart disease and strokes, factors linked to dementia, and a rise in the number of people using blood pressure medicines and getting a high school diploma, which reduce the likelihood of developing the condition. 'The results bring some hope that perhaps dementia cases might be preventable, or at least delayed' by improving health and education, said the study leader, Claudia Satizabal of Boston University. Dallas Anderson, epidemiology chief at the National Institute on Aging, agreed. 'For those who get the disease, it may come later in life, which is a good thing. Getting the disease in your 80s or 90s is a very different than getting it in your early 70s,' he said. In Germany, researchers from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases say that claims data from Germany's largest public health insurance company suggest that new cases of dementia declined significantly between 2007 and 2009 in men and women. Women vs men: The study found the decline in dementia rates was more prevalent in women than men . Dementia prevalence - the proportion of people with the disease - also declined dramatically in women ages 74 to 85. There was a trend toward a smaller decline in men but the difference was so small researchers couldn't be sure of it. The trends corresponded with fewer strokes and better treatment of high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes, and more education, they said. In Asia and Africa an updated study of dementia prevalence by Alzheimer's Disease International in 2009 concludes that its previous estimates for the disease worldwide were too low. The group now says dementia prevalence appears to have increased from about 5 percent to about 7 percent in East Asia, and in Sub-Saharan African from between 2 percent and 4 percent to nearly 5 percent. The estimates were revised based on studies in China and sub-Saharan Africa, and the latest United Nations population projections. In Colombia, researchers from the Universidad Icesi in Colombia used current population and other sources of information to update a 20-year-old study on dementia and determined that current projections might underestimate dementia cases by up to 50 percent. In countries where dementia appears to be declining, the rise in obesity and diabetes threatens to undo progress. 'It may be that what we have now is a sweet spot,' where people with these problems are still relatively young, said Anderson, of the National Institute on Aging. 'They're not in the dementia range yet, but what's going to happen? We know they're all in the pipeline.'","An American over age 60 today has a 44 percent lower chance of developing dementia than a similar-aged person did roughly 30 years ago .

A woman has died of a suspected heroin overdose at Occupy Vancouver as violence escalated at camps across America over the weekend, arousing concerns the protests may claim more victims. The Mayor of Vancouver Gregor Robertson called for the camp to be closed down after the woman's body was found on Saturday. She was said to be in her twenties and found in a tent by another protestor. She was pronounced dead upon arrival at hospital. On Thursday, a man went into cardiac arrest at the Vancouver site, also from a suspected overdose, but was rescued by a first aider until paramedics arrived. Scroll down for videos .

Mr Robertson said the city is considering a number of options that include a possible injunction to end the encampment but that they want to do it as safely as possible. Meanwhile it emerged that Kayvan Sabeghi, the second Iraq war veteran beaten by police during the confrontations in Oakland, was not actually a protestor but was simply trying to make his way home after having dinner with friends. The 32-year old was arrested and charged with resisting arrest and remaining present at a riot and was only hospitalised when he was eventually freed on bail, despite telling police he needed medical help. Friend and colleague Esther Goodstal said Mr Sabeghi was simply trying to get home when he was encountered a line of . police at the protest who wouldn't let him through.

Heidi Sippel told CBS that she, her 13-year-old son and her wife Brandy Sippel were taking part in the demonstration when a silver Lexus sped toward them. The driver slowed down, threw up his hands in apparent frustration and then drove forward, hitting them, she said. Brandy Sippel, who is six months pregnant, was grazed by the car's rearview mirror. Heidi Sippel said she and her son were both hit by the front of the car. Last night, police arrested more than 20 people after an Occupy Atlanta protest rally in a city park spilled onto the streets and officers converged on them on motorcycles, on horseback and in riot gear. A crowd of several hundred protesters had gathered at Woodruff Park, the scene of about 50 arrests of demonstrators last month, and set up tents. Organizers had said they planned to stay overnight despite warnings from the mayor and police that anyone there past the 11pm closing would be arrested. But as 11pm approached, protesters began decamping peacefully. Dozens of officers were on hand, herding protesters away from the park's entrances and installing barricades around it. A police helicopter flew overhead. While most protesters left the park, a few people stayed behind. And as demonstrators poured onto Peachtree Street and downtown, a police officer on a motorcycle drove into the crowd, sparking a confrontation between officers and protesters that turned tense at times. Police officers in riot gear and on horseback filled the street, warning protesters to stay on the sidewalk. The protesters shouted at the officers, chanting slogans such as, 'Shame! Shame!' and 'What about your pensions?' A small group yelled more insulting things like: 'Put the pigs back in their sty, we the people occupy.' Police made a number of arrests, mostly people who disobeyed orders to stay on the sidewalk.","Weekend of violence and chaos across America .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A few hours after Marcus Arceneaux was pictured carrying his bloodied niece Bethany to safety yesterday, the young woman's family have revealed how they tracked down and took on her kidnapper in a deadly confrontation. Two days after the 29-year-old mother was abducted by her ex-boyfriend Scott Thomas, her family found her being held hostage in an abandoned Louisiana house. In the violent confrontation that followed, Miss Arceneaux was stabbed by Thomas who was then apparently shot dead as her rescuers took justice into their own hands. Rescued: Marcus Arceneaux carries his niece, Bethany, to safety after she was kidnapped and stabbed in an abandoned house . Remote: Bethany Arceneaux was rescued from an abandoned house in Louisiana, close to where her kidnapper's car was found . 'We kicked doors down. It was like a movie unfolding,' Miss Arceneaux's brother, Ryan, told the Advertiser. 'If we would have waited, she would have been dead.' Ryan was part of a search party made up of family and friends who were helping police try to find Miss Arceneaux after Thomas, the father of her two-year-old son, grabbed her on Wednesday evening. At around noon on Friday the group were investigating an abandoned house, barely visible through the sugar cane fields surrounding it. The house, on Anderson Road, was close to where Thomas had ditched his car on Wednesday night. Marcus Arceneaux, who helped rescue his niece, told KLFY 10: 'Everyone came running from the building and when I ran that way I saw my son was coming with Bethany. He had discovered her and got her out of that house.' Search party: Family and friends used off road vehicles to search remote areas shielded by sugar cane fields . Hero: Marcus Arceneaux carried his niece to safety after her horrifying ordeal . Kaylyn Alfred, another of the victim's brothers, said they heard screams for help as they entered the desolate building. As the search party confronted Thomas, who was the subject of a restraining order, he allegedly began to harm Miss Arceneaux. In the tussle that followed Thomas was shot and Marcus Arceneaux was able to grab his niece and carry her to safety. 'She’s shook up, she’s sliced up, but she’s alright, Ryan said. His sister was believed to have been stabbed but is recovering in hospital and has been reunited with her son. Captain Kip Justice of the Lafayette Parish Police Department confirmed that 29-year-old Thomas died as a result of injuries received in the confrontation. Stand off: Police use their car as a shield as they surround the house Scott Thomas was hiding in . Search party: Police creep up on the house after the victim's family helped her break free . Captain Judice said the family were . acting in defense of Miss Arceneaux and it is unclear at this time if . charges will be brought against anyone in her family. In June Bethany Arceneaux filed a protection order against Scott Thomas, after he locked her inside their home and made threats to harm her. Thomas was barred from coming near his ex-girlfriend or son, and was ordered to stay away from her home and his child's daycare center. In the order she claimed Thomas had choked her, dragged her by her hair and 'held a knife to my throat countless times'. During the final episode before she left him she said he made threats to kill her. She . added: 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my . work looking for me. I am afraid for me and my son's life.' Thomas abducted Miss Arceneaux as she collected her son from daycare on Wednesday, November 6. 'The . man began harming her. He [Arceneaux’s family member] did what he . needed to do to stop that aggressive behavior from Mr Thomas,' Captain . Judice said. Police, who . were also searching for the victim and were close by when shots were . fired, are now trying to piece together what happened. The . search for Miss Arceneaux began when witnesses saw Thomas bundle her . into a car at 5.20pm on Wednesday as she collected their son from a . daycare center. The . 29-year-old was seen forcing his victim into a Buick LeSabre before . driving off with her, leaving the victim's child abandoned in her car. Miss Arceneaux had filed a protection order earlier this year against Thomas, claiming he had locked her and their young son in the family home and threatened to kill her. The protection order had barred Thomas from coming close to his ex-girlfriend's home or son's daycare center after the threatening episode. 'After we called cops on him he grabbed our son from me and shoved him into the car,' Miss Arceneaux wrote on the order. 'He then got on his knees in front of the cops and said ""I swear to God on all my children I will kill you.' She added: 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my work looking for me. I am afraid for me and my son's life.' Hostage: Scott Thomas grabbed Bethany Arceneaux, the mother of his child, on Wednesday evening . The . getaway car was found later that day in Anderson Road, Duson, but it . wasn't until Friday that Miss Arceneaux was rescued from an abandoned . house on the same street. Lafayette . Police Corporal . Paul . Mouton told MailOnline that after her rescue a swat team entered the . house, and found the 'suspect was deceased' at about 3pm (CST) on . Friday. Captain Judice said the victim's family found her after hearing her screams. 'Family members are walking through a pasture with an abandoned home ... and heard a yell from inside the home,' he said. Relatives first told KATC TV-3 that gunfire was . exchanged between the family and the alleged kidnapper. Mr . Arceneaux, the victim's uncle, said: 'We found my niece Bethany, she's . OK. I'd like to thank everybody who came out and helped us search.' Saved: Bethany Arceneaux was rescued when a search party of friends and family heard her yell out . 'Friends and family actually came . into contact with the victim and the suspect in or out of the house,' Corporal Mouton told KPEL. 'There was a confrontation at that point. During that . confrontation, the victim was freed,' he said, adding that Miss Arceneaux was said to be in 'good condition other than some injuries that she had received'. The couple have a violent history revealed in several police reports, according to KATC 3. She had filed several reports alleging domestic abuse and also filed a restraining order against Thomas.","Scott Thomas killed by rescue party searching for Bethany Arceneaux .

"By . Associated Press . Pope Francis has called for 'urgent intervention' to welcome and protect minors traveling on their own from Central and South America to the United States in increasing numbers. The pontiff said today that such measures should include an information campaign on the dangers of the journey. He called on the international community to rise to the challenge and adopt 'new forms of legal and safe migration.' Scroll down for video . Pope Francis seen waiving in Saint Peter's square at the Vatican on Sunday . Tens of thousands of children have streamed from chaotic Central American nations in recent months to the U.S. border, overwhelming the government's ability to respond. Francis issued his message in a letter to a Vatican conference on migration in Mexico, drawing attention to the 'tens of thousands of children who are emigrating alone, unaccompanied, to flee poverty and violence.' The Pope's comments came after the U.S. deported Honduran children as young as 1-1/2 years old on Monday in the first flight since President Obama pledged to speed up the process of sending back illegal immigrant minors from Central America. Fleeing violence and poverty, record numbers of children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have crossed into the United States over the past year, sparking intense debate about how to solve the problem. Women and their children walk on the tarmac after being deported from the U.S., at the Ramon Villeda international airport in San Pedro Sula on Monday . Monday's flight from New Mexico to San Pedro Sula, the city with the highest murder rate in the world, returned 17 Honduran women, as well as 12 girls and nine boys, aged between 18 months and 15 years. The Hondurans were from among a group of immigrants who've been housed at an Artesia, New Mexico emergency detention facility opened as other centers became completely overwhelmed. The Artesia Center was opened in barracks of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. It eventually will hold about 700 women and children. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson visited the facility in a visit that seemed crafted to show detainees that America is not the welcoming place they may have thought. 'Our border is not open to illegal immigration,' he said. 'Our message to those who come illegally is we will send you back.'","Pope said measures need to include an information campaign about the dangers of the journey .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC’s best-paid presenters are in revolt against plans to axe their tax-saving freelance contracts. The corporation had promised the Government it would stop paying staff through ‘personal service companies’ that can attract a lower rate of tax. But it may be forced to back down in the face of mounting anger from stars on the deals. Star names: It is understood presenters including Fiona Bruce (left) and Emily Maitlis (right) are among those who use personal service companies, which attract a lower rate of tax . Jeremy Paxman, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis are all paid in this way. Those . whose freelance contracts are close to expiry have been asked to end . their off-payroll arrangements to avoid suspicion of tax avoidance. But . by signing on as a staff member – and qualifying for a BBC pension and . other benefits – they would have to accept pay cuts of up to 25 per . cent. Instead of caving in . to the demands, many have refused to sign staff contracts, leaving the . BBC to consider either firing some of its biggest names or to accept . defeat. An insider to the . negotiations described the situation as chaos, adding: ‘The BBC is in an . impossible position. Its own staff have it over a barrel. ‘It . has promised to change the way it pays its people, but is powerless to . do anything because they would rather leave than give in and they are . all acting as one. The bottom line is the BBC can’t afford to lose its . top people.’ The  personal service company arrangements have been . branded ‘staggeringly inappropriate’ by the Commons public accounts . committee, which suggested the BBC could be complicit in tax avoidance. The . rate of corporation tax – which companies pay on profits – is up to 20 . per cent lower than the income tax that high-earning individuals face. Top names: Jeremy Paxman (left) channels his earnings through a company whose most recent accounts showed it had £218,000 in the bank. Sarah Montague (right), a presenter on Radio 4’s Today programme, disclosed she paid herself £165,000 through her personal service company in the past financial year . Last . night, Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who sits on the public accounts . committee, said the failure of the BBC to resolve its pay arrangements . was extremely disappointing: ‘It shows the weakness of the senior . management of the BBC that undertakings of openness and transparency . have come to nothing.’ More . than 6,000 BBC freelancers are paid through personal service companies, . allowing them to be taxed as companies rather than individuals. Mr . Paxman, who hosts the flagship BBC2 show Newsnight, channels his . earnings through a company called Out In The Dark Ltd. Its most recent . accounts showed it had £218,000 in the bank. His . freelance contract has not yet come up for renewal, meaning he has not . yet been forced to consider whether he will sign a staff contract. Sarah . Montague, a presenter on Radio 4’s Today programme, disclosed she paid . herself £165,000 through her personal service company in the past year. The sums may include fees from outside engagements such as speaking . events. There is no suggestion any of the individuals on the contracts have acted improperly or deliberately sought to avoid tax. Mr Paxman claimed in 2012 that the BBC had ordered him to form a company if he wanted to continue to present Newsnight. BBC: Broadcasting House is already in a battle with stars over plans to axe tax-saving freelance contracts . One . of the few presenters to sign a staff contract is Today presenter John . Humphrys, who agreed to come on to the books last year. Sue . Ayton, a talent agent whose BBC clients include Michael Buerk, Samira . Ahmed and Moira Stewart, said: ‘In my opinion the BBC – with its huge . internal resources – has got into a real mess on this one and after . spending a great deal of time and money trying to resolve it has only . created more confusion and frustration.’ A . BBC spokesman said last night: ‘From November last year the BBC has . been applying a new employment test to all on-air television presenters.

"By . Topper Toussaint . Sherri and Jenny are out. Rosie and Whoopi are in. But who's going to fill the remaining three hot seats when The View returns to the air this fall? MailOnline has compiled a list of ABC's top contenders to replace the exiting Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy on the show that Barbara Walters built - and left 'kicking and screaming,' according to a network source. In a desperate search to fill at least two of the three vacancies in time for the show's return in September - right now ABC is only planning to fill two spots - the network has been holding casting meetings with talent, even conducting one pivotal meeting on the July 4th holiday. Scroll down for video . No love lost: Controversial talk show host Rosie O'Donnell is calling the shots on The View now, and veteran newscaster and the show's founder Barbara Walters left 'kicking and screaming,' says a network insider . A source close to the network has revealed to MailOnline the five  top contenders to join Rosie O'Donnell, 52,  and Whoopi Goldberg, 58,  when the chat show returns in September. The finalists include a Republican presidential candidate's daughter, a local New York anchor, the wife of a Republican Congressman,  a CNN legal analyst and a pregnant, previously ousted former moderator on The View. Despite reports that Barbara Walters is . helping to determine the new co-hosts, a source reveals that Walters has . no involvement in the show any more. Although the TV legend is still credited as an executive . producer, it’s in name only, claims the source. Additionally, Walters herself has been . taking meetings with various news organizations in New York looking for a new gig. At 84-years-old, she's been telling anyone who will listen that . she was 'not ready to retire.' According to Walters' rep, 'She is under contract with ABC News and is not looking or meeting with other news outlets. 'Additionally, Ms. Walters remains creator and Executive Producer of The View. But insiders says outspoken Rosie holds the power now. Rosie, who joined the show in 2006 only to leave the following year after a famously heated on-air exchange with conservative Elizabeth Hasselbeck over the Bush administration's stance on the Iraq war, among other controversies. Now Rosie will help choose her new conservative counterpart as well as a more liberal voice on the panel. The top contenders are: . The youth vote: At 28, she's the youngest of the candidates and she's had gigs at both ABC News and GMA . Abby, 28, is a . conservative anchor on MSNBC's The Cycle who has guest-hosted on The . View several times in recent months. The daughter of former Utah . Governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, she's . in the running because she could reach a younger demographic for the . show. Despite being a Republican, she appeared in a 2013 campaign in . support of gay marriage. Abby was criticized by the Los Angeles Times this past March when she tried to discuss Social Security on 'The Cycle'. Her discussion 'bristled with rank misconceptions and bogus statistics,' it said. Less kind critics called her an 'airhead' and a Bush boot licker. But maybe she can warm up viewers by talking about her love of chocolate, golden retrievers, music and running. Abby was the first one of six siblings to marry outside of the Mormon Church when she married her college sweetheart, Jeffrey Bruce Livington, in an Episcopal ceremony. Safe BET: Jacque was the lead news anchor of BET Nightly News for four years and has been a guest co-host on The View . An anchor on New . York's local NBC affiliate show New York Live and on-air contributor to . the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show, Reid, 29, starred on VH1's Let's Talk . About Pep. She almost landed the co-host job at The View in 2007, but . was ultimately beat out by Sherri Shepherd. With more than fifteen years of media experience, Reid decided in early 2014 to launch her own website,SingleAndLivingFab.com, about her views on being single and loving it as well as interracial dating as a southern gal from Atlanta, GA. Just go for it, she advises, celebrate life and live your best single life wherever you are. 'I love all people, but I especially love black people'. If a fabulous man doesn't come along, plan something fabulous for your own life, she advises. She does love to show deep cleavage and bare shoulders on TV, and wears short skirts and high heels. Get real: Mom of six Rachel first claim to fame was as a castmate on The Real World: San Francisco . The third . time could be the charm for Duffy, a conservative Latina who has been up . for the gig at The View twice before. Despite losing out to both Lisa . Ling and Elizabeth Hasselbeck, the 42-year-old mother of six - pregnant with her seventh - has come . back to co-host multiple times this spring. She's married to Republican . Congressman Sean Duffy. She wrote a book in 2009 entitled, Stay Home, Stay Happy: 10 Secrets to Loving At-home Motherhood, but the intoxication of motherhood must have worn off for the parenting expert who's aiming to live in New York if she gets on The View and feels the urgency to enter the 'lion's den' in the era of Kim Kardashian to challenge political opponents on their liberal policies. But Duffy's claim to fame has more to do with her 'real' life before family. As a housemate on The Real Life: San Francisco in 1994 she caused a stir when she had initial concerns about a housemate who was HIV-positive and had a tumultuous fling with David 'Puck' Rainey. Laying down the law: She's a former US Attorney and has appeared on Fox News as well as CNN . CNN's resident legal eagle just finished a one week guest-hosting stint . where she was quick to remind viewers that she's a Latina. Hostin, 45, . would be the first attorney to join the show since Star Jones was fired . in 2006. But The View is seriously interested in appealing to the . Latin market and feel she's a good fit. She joined CNN from the Fox News Channel, where she appeared regularly on The O'Reilly Factor's Is It Legal segment. The outspoken New York native of Puerto Rican and African-American decent has jumped on headline grabbing trials and legal issues in her on-air jobs. She has been married to Dr. Emmanuel Hostin, an Orthopedic Surgeon since 1998 and has two young children but two nannies and a housekeeper to help out at home as well as her mother who lives in the Hostins' carriage house. It was her mother, an indomitable Latin matriarch, who convinced her not to go into TV news but to go to law school which would be far more lucrative and match her drive and ambition. Fired: The mom-to-be was one of the original five on the show until she was let go by Walters. Rosie likes her . One of the . original five co-hosts, Matenopoulos was fired in 1999 after the first season . because Barbara Walters said she didn't have the TV experience they . thought she did. She was ruthlessly parodied on Saturday . Night Live an an uninformed ditz. Her first marriage to Jay Faires, an . LA music executive ended in divorce in 2008 when he charged they . continuously lived beyond their means. He took her to court to pay the . bills. Matenpoulos didn't find love again until 2012 when she met . photographer Jon Falcon, and she announced this spring that they secretly eloped last summer and have a baby due in the fall. An on air birth? That's good for ratings! Men need not apply for one of the open seats. In spite of reports that Bill Rancic, Ross Matthews and Jesse Palmer are in the running, the network insider says that's not so.  Both Rosie and Whoopi only want women on the permanent panel. Sources close to 'The View' reveal that O'Donnell is upset about not being able to work alongside Shepherd. It was O'Donnell who really championed for Shepherd to join the show back during the 2006/2007 season and she always appreciated how Shepherd was able to tell a joke during O'Donnell's infamous altercation with Elizabeth Hasselbeck to diffuse the situation. Shepherd announced she was leaving the show several weeks ago after failing to come to terms with ABC. The source tells MailOnline that Shepherd only wanted to return to the show for a year and wanted to receive a substantial raise, as she's been carrying the show for a year and a half. ABC wanted to lock the comedienne into a four-year contract and wouldn't budge. She decided not to stay. No boys allowed: Rumors that guys like former Bachelor Jesse Palmer or reality star Bill Rancic are being considered are just that, says the network source. Neither Rosie nor Whoopi want men on the show . Rear view: Show execs wanted Sherri to stay - for four years. She wanted one year. And after moving to New York from Chicago with her son, Jenny was given the heave-ho . Her colleague McCarthy on the other hand was misled by the network. Having been told that ABC intended to renew her deal, McCarthy moved her special needs son Evan to New York from Chicago.  Three weeks later, ABC changed its mind and decided to let her go. She was so furious she vowed never to return to the show initially, but Goldberg convinced her to work through the rest of the summer. Also departing the scene are two producers and a director who were not particularly in Rosie's favor. Executive Producer Bill Geddie will produce the show until the end of the summer. Another senior producer was terminated and made to leave the building that day. When The View returns in September, the show will have moved from its current studio of 17 years and will broadcast from a smaller studio that recently housed The Katie Couric Show.","ABC is getting closer to replacing Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy and five candidates have made the short list .

"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Correspondent . Dale Bolinger, 57, is accused of buying an axe before travelling to meet with a girl, 14, who he planned to have sex with, kill and eat . A nurse told a 14-year-old girl he planned to kill and eat her as he groomed her for sex online, a court heard. Dale Bolinger, 57, even went to a local DIY shop and bought an axe the day before he was due to meet his victim. But she did not turn up and he was arrested after his sick boasts were discovered by investigators on a sinister internet chat room. Yesterday Bolinger – who had the username ‘meatmarketman’ next to a profile picture of model Naomi Campbell – went on trial accused of grooming the girl for sex. The NHS hospital nurse was a regular user of the Dark Fetish  Network where he chatted about rape, murder and cannibalism, a crown court heard, . He claimed to have already eaten a 39-year-old black woman and a five year-old child, saying the meat of children is much more ‘tender’. In September 2012, he exchanged messages with a girl called ‘Eva Gonza’, whose true identity has never been discovered. The pair agreed to meet at  Ashford International rail station, Kent, but the teenager did not appear, the court was told. Five months later, FBI agents alerted British police after discovering the internet exchanges.Bolinger, a nurse since 1979, was arrested at the Kent hospital where he worked and police found photographs of him posing with the axe on his computer. Prosecutor Martin Yale said: ‘Dark Fetish Network is a website for those who fantasize about various things, including cannibalism. ‘It is the Crown’s case that one of the users that Bolinger befriended on it was someone he believed to be a 14-year-old girl. ‘And having discussed with her his fantasies, made arrangements to meet her with the intention of committing a sexual offence.’ ‘Eva’ claimed to be a Mexican  living . in Germany, the court heard, as Bolinger told her of perverted sexual . acts he would perform before murdering her. Mr . Yale read excerpts of their internet chats in which he made ‘graphic . references’ to sexual abuse, murder and cannibalism of women and . children, including a baby’. Bolinger . said he was willing to kill his victim with the method of her choice . and she ‘responded that she would like this to happen’. The nurse's plan was uncovered by the FBI - who found him posting about murder, rape and cannibalism on a site called Dark Fetish Network. The organisation then alerted British police who arrested the man last year . He said: ‘I’ve got the cleaver and the experience. Really want to do it? I would want to have your body afterwards for food...’ The ‘girl’ is said to have replied: ‘I don’t know why I want this but since I was 12 I need it.’ When she said she did not believe Bolinger would go through with it, he said: ‘Meet me at Ashford train station and I WILL complete on the deal. I’ve twice eaten girls.’ Adding ‘girl back on the menu’, he said: ‘I don’t like waste and I’ll eat everything from your feet to your face. Roasts, sausages even your offal. I’ve a great recipe for Haggis and Black (blood) pudding. You’ll be completely consumed.’ Bolinger swapped messages with other users, including one known as Hannah Hotwife, whom he sent pictures of himself with an axe. After . his arrest, police discovered he had bought an axe from Homebase in . Broadstairs, Kent, before telling Eva: ‘Got the axe, you ready to get . that train?’ Bolinger was planning to meet with Eva - who he met online - at Ashford International Station (pictured), but she failed to show up. He denies arranging to meet an underage girl and grooming . Phone records showed he went to the Ashford area on the date they agreed but later remonstrated with her when she did not show up. The jury was told Bolinger was arrested after a probe by the FBI in New York into depraved web chat rooms. They found an email link to his home in Kent and alerted local police. Bolinger told officers he would have called police and social services if the girl had turned up. Mr Yale added: ‘He said people gave false information and he took everything “with a pinch of salt”.’ Bolinger, formerly of Canterbury, Kent, had ‘taken his fantasies beyond the chat room’ before, it was alleged. In February, the court heard, he admitted putting a cloth soaked in dry cleaning fluid over the mouth of a woman friend and later boasted about this online. He denies sexually grooming a child. The trial continues at  Canterbury Crown Court. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dale Bolinger, 57, bought an axe before travelling to meet teen, court told .

"By . Daniel Johnson . David Cameron's decision to remove Michael Gove as Education Secretary is an act of folly for which our children will pay a heavy price. Gove is the one man in the Cabinet who entered office with a clear vision of what he needed to change in his department and proceeded to force through his reforms against visceral resistance from the Left, teachers and his own civil servants. For four years, he has been a lightning conductor for their hatred. Now that he is to step down, the Prime Minister has handed a trophy to his enemies. Scroll down for video . Impact: The decision to remove Michael Gove is an act of folly for which our children will pay a heavy price. Will Nicky Morgan, Gove’s successor, be able to withstand the brickbats and bullying tactics of the Left? For the bone-idle education system bureaucrats, teachers’ union bosses and the Marxist ideologues who dominate the education establishment, Gove’s departure is a cause for rejoicing. When he first took on the role, he signalled a revolution by renaming his ministry. Out went the vapid ‘Department for Children, Schools and Families’ in favour of plain old ‘Department for Education’. Here, at last, was a Conservative Education Secretary who was not ashamed of old-fashioned views: that children go to school to learn, not to have fun; that classroom discipline is essential; that knowledge is better than ignorance. The Gove revolution has been driven through with messianic zeal. Although the teaching unions have fought him tooth and nail all the way, the results of Gove’s actions are already transforming the prospects of the younger generation. It is a tragedy that the man whose courage and energy started this revolution is now to be denied the chance to finish the job. Adopted as a boy by an Aberdeen family of modest means, Gove has risen by his own efforts. In the Cameron Cabinet of the privileged and the entitled, he was the scholarship boy who made good. He also stands in stark contrast to his Labour counterpart, the Hon Tristram Hunt, a son of privilege. Gove’s great, transformative insight was that our education system had departed too far from the traditional aim of passing on our British culture — ‘the best which has been thought and said’ — in favour of a vague notion of developing ‘skills’. Bravely, he immediately set about filling the intellectual vacuum left by decades of the Left’s ‘progressive’ education policies. He did so with a bloody-minded determination to give every child the best possible chance of success in life. He insisted that pupils should learn history, especially British history, as a continuous narrative rather than as isolated incidents: ‘The Tudors’, ‘The Trenches’, ‘The Blitz’. He demanded that they should read the Classics and learn poems by heart. He wanted children to emerge from school as rounded, educated, articulate adults, capable of competing with the best in the world. Despite his reputation as the teachers’ bogeyman, Gove has inspired hundreds of dedicated young men and women to found new free schools. Parents have eagerly embraced the greater choice available as they chose a school for their children. Yesterday, the gloating of the Left over Gove’s demise spoke volumes about how effective he’d been. Among them was the far-Left NUT leader Christine Blower, who sneered that his departure would be a lovely end-of-term surprise for her members and boasted that their strikes had claimed his scalp. Reaction: On the front page of the NUT website, a huge picture of Gove had been posted with the caption: ‘Gone!' Pictured right, he looks down during his appearance on the Andrew Marr show earlier this month . On the front page of the NUT website, a huge picture of Gove had been posted with the caption: ‘Gone!’ Grinning from ear to ear, Hunt looked as if he could hardly believe his luck. On Twitter, there was crowing from the Left-wing commentator Owen Jones, who said: ‘Cheers, whoops and other outbursts of jubilation sweep the nation’s staff rooms as disastrous Michael Gove stripped of education and demoted.’ Gove’s removal is fraught with risk. In his absence, the education department is like Hamlet without the Prince. Will Nicky Morgan, Gove’s successor, be able to withstand the brickbats and bullying tactics of the Left? Already, yesterday, union leaders were calling on Morgan to abandon his reforms. Labour remains ideologically opposed to the educational principles and traditional values that underlie the Gove revolution. The fact that his Labour shadow Hunt pays lip service to free schools and other parts of the Gove legacy should not deceive us. In a Cabinet of conformists, Gove has always been his own man. In the 20 years that I have known him, both in journalism and politics, I have never once seen Michael betray his principles. Such integrity is very rare in a politician at any time and even rarer in the Tory Party of today. Cameron’s demotion of Gove is a tragic demonstration that he does not understand what his own government will undoubtedly be remembered for. Together with Iain Duncan Smith’s war on Britain’s bloated welfare dependency culture and George Osborne’s success at the Treasury, Gove got things done. When historians look back on the Coalition, they will recall that it turned round the economy, reformed welfare and started to restore sanity to our schools. But by taking his most brilliant minister out of the political front-line, Cameron has put the future of education in this country in jeopardy. n Daniel Johnson is editor of Standpoint.","Editor of Standpoint magazine believes Gove's ousting is an act of folly .

"By . Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent . Border guards are suing the Government because they claim their new uniforms are causing painful skin conditions. The Home Office spent £3million on the navy blue outfits for UK Border Force workers last year. But around 250 employees are taking legal action after claiming the material has left them with chemical-style burns, rashes and other ailments. Around 250 UK Border Force employees are taking legal action after claiming their uniforms have left them with painful skin conditions (file picture) Some have apparently even had to wear silk clothing beneath their uniforms. And asthma sufferers are also said to have experienced problems. The employees are bringing personal injury claims thought to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. Lawyers for the guards – whose tasks include manning passport control – say that they have suffered skin irritations because of dyes and other chemicals in the uniforms, which are manufactured in Bangladesh. Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the ISU trade union, which represents 5,000 Border Force staff, said: ‘We have members who now have to wear silk “burn garments” beneath their uniforms to keep the material off  their skin.’ She added: ‘Many have suffered a low-grade chemical-type burn. ‘People have been prescribed high-powered steroids to try to calm the irritation down and others have been told they will suffer hypo-allergenic sensitivity for the rest of their lives. ‘Uniforms for the 8,000 staff were produced to a tight timescale. We believe that these problems arose because it was a rush job.’ 'We have members who now have to wear silk “burn garments” beneath their uniforms to keep the material off  their skin.’ She said that asthma sufferers had also experienced problems with an ‘acrid’ smell emitted from the shirts and cargo-style trousers, which are made of polyester and polycotton materials. The uniforms were ordered by the Government last year. They finally came into use this March. Instead of pale shirts, the national gatekeepers now wear extremely dark ‘border blue’ shirts with epaulettes, trousers, jumpers and the rest all in precisely the  same shade. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The material used for our uniforms has been subject to rigorous independent testing.’ However, he added: ‘We are aware that a small number of staff have reported some irritation. ‘We provide guidance to all staff when they collect their uniform.’ The spokesman said that anyone who experienced discomfort was advised to ‘raise it with their line manager’.","Home Office spent £3million on outfits for UK Border Force staff last year .

"By . Sarah Harris . A primary school where only 20 per cent of pupils speak English as their first language has been named the best in the country at a national teaching awards. The native tongues of children at St Mary’s C of E Primary in Moss Side, Manchester, include Arabic, Kurdish, Urdu and Somali. Other languages spoken at the inner-city school are Dutch, French, Polish, Lithuanian and Wolof – a regional language spoken in Senegal and The Gambia. And around 80 per cent of the children come from very low-income families, qualifying them for free school meals. Achievers: Despite the fact that only one in five pupils speak English as their first language, St Mary's C of E Primary in Moss Side, Manchester, has been named Primary of the Year . Headteacher Jenny McGarry said she was 'absolutely over the moon' to have won the award . But despite the fact that only one in five pupils speak English as their first language, the school in the estate has been named Primary of the Year at at the Times Education Supplement (TES) School Awards. St Mary’s was commended for its ‘amazing’ attempt to raise pupils’ aspirations. The primary, which is rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted, is in the top 2 per cent in the country for improving pupils’ reading and the top 7 per cent for improvements in maths. And this is not the first time it has been recognised for its achievements. Last year St Mary’s won the TES community and enterprise award for helping unemployed parents find job placements. The primary, which is rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted, is in the top 2 per cent in the country for improving pupils' reading and the top 7 per cent for improvements in maths . It also runs a scheme to help provide chaperones for children as they walk to school in the morning, to ensure that parents can get in to work on time. Headteacher Jenny McGarry said she was ‘absolutely over the moon’ to have won the award, adding: ‘It is really, really nice to have that recognition for everybody who works here day in, day out helping the children make this progress. ‘It shows that Moss Side is a great place to live and a great place to go to school. It also challenges the idea that children from this area are less likely to achieve.’ The headteacher said the award 'challenges the idea that children from this area are less likely to achieve' Staff at the 427-pupil school were presented with the award at a ceremony in London. They said that the secret to their success was encouraging pupils to have a ‘will do’ rather than a ‘can do’ attitude. And Mrs McGarry went on to reveal her top five tips for boosting pupils’ progress. She said: ‘Have high expectations, make sure these are delivered by outstanding staff, encourage really positive behaviour, engage with parents and the community to develop the whole child and seize every opportunity to enhance pupils’ learning.’ Judges at the TES awards ceremony said: ‘This is an amazing school which has an amazing record of achievement in incredibly difficult circumstances. 'Their can-do approach to achievement is an inspiration.’","St Mary's in Manchester praised for 'amazing' attempts to inspire children .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An undertaker who poured flour over a neighbour’s Mercedes for blocking in his hearse was jailed yesterday. Funeral director Julian Riley, 39, and Peter Elliot, 60, had argued over parking for weeks after the property developer bought a house opposite Riley’s business, a court heard. Then last September Riley was caught on CCTV emptying a 2lb bag of self-raising flour over Mr Elliot’s black Mercedes E-320. Julian Riley, 39, who was jailed yesterday for pouring flour over his neighbour's Mercedes . The court was told it set ‘like cement’ when it rained and some of it could not be removed without scratching the paintwork. Police arrested Riley after following a line of white powder back to his funeral parlour in the village of Clydach near Abergavenny, South Wales. Peter Elliot, who was a neighbour of Riley, and had his car damaged when flour was poured over it . He was jailed for two weeks by Newport magistrates after admitting causing criminal damage, ordered to pay £200 compensation and banned from contacting his neighbour. Prosecutor Rob Simkins said: 'The case revolves around a dispute between Julian Riley and Peter Elliot. 'It came to a head when Riley poured flour over Mr Elliot's Mercedes. The flour covered the windscreen, bonnet and roof. 'A trail of white powder led from the vehicle across the road to the defendant's property.' Riley fell out with Mr Elliot after he bought a house opposite his funeral parlour. Newport Magistrates heard the pair had argued over parking for weeks - and Riley threw flour over Mr Elliot's car after he left it unattended for just 25 minutes. Property developer Mr Elliot was convinced the undertaker had covered his cherished Mercedes in 'embalming powder'. Riley told police: 'I didn't do it' but officers checked CCTV at the funeral parlour and found footage of him pouring flour all over the car.

"By . Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured, is said to be furious after High Court judges made it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in Britain from claiming legal aid . Human rights judges sparked anger yesterday by ruling it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in Britain from claiming legal aid. To the fury of Chris Grayling, the High Court said introducing a residence test to tackle abuses of taxpayers’ money was ‘unlawful and discriminatory’ and pandered to prejudice. The Justice Secretary had brought in measures, due to be enacted next month, to prevent overseas nationals receiving public money for civil claims until they have lived in Britain for at least a year. He took urgent action after ‘disturbing’ claims emerged that a group of Iraqis whose lawyers secured millions in legal aid had actually conspired to allege British soldiers executed and tortured prisoners. Currently there are no nationality or residence restrictions on funding, which leaves Britain with a huge annual bill of £2billion. But in a highly unusual move, Lord Justice Moses – who last year branded the legal aid reforms a ‘joke’ – shot down the laws before they had even come into force. Invoking the controversial Human Rights Act, he ruled the radical crackdown was ‘not lawful’ and banning foreigners from accessing legal aid breached their rights to a fair trial and not to face discrimination. In an extraordinary ruling, he said Mr Grayling’s claim that the curbs were vital to ‘command public confidence’ amounted to ‘little more than reliance on public prejudice’. The Ministry of Justice said it intended to appeal the ruling. But Mr Grayling was understood to be furious. A source said: ‘It’s not fair to expect UK taxpayers to pay the legal bills of people who have barely stepped over the border. ‘The residence test is a common sense approach that required people to have a strong connection to the UK before they could be given civil legal aid.’ The Government pushed the new laws through Parliament last Wednesday after concerns over the Al Sweady inquiry into claims British troops abused prisoners in Iraq. The scandal of legal aid was highlighted by the Daily Mail yesterday when an Ethiopian farmer won permission to use taxpayers¿ money to sue the British Government for sending aid to his homeland . After a year-long hearing, which cost taxpayers £23million, the case sensationally fell apart in March when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in a central claim – that insurgents were murdered. It is claimed the Iraqis – who have no residency rights in Britain and all live overseas – would never have got up to £10million in legal aid if the full facts had been known at the time. The scandal of legal aid was highlighted by the Mail yesterday when an Ethiopian farmer won permission to use taxpayers’ money to sue the British Government for sending aid to his homeland. The 33-year-old – granted anonymity to protect his family – successfully argued foreign aid helped the regime inflict ‘brutal treatment’ on thousands of farmers driven from their land. Now the ruling, by three judges, opens the doors for legal aid lawyers based in Britain to trawl overseas to find more cases to bring against the authorities. Judges at the High Court, pictured, said introducing a residence test to tackle abuses of taxpayers' money was 'unlawful and discriminatory' and pandered to prejudice . The legal challenge came from the legal charity Public Law Project, which said the test would discriminate against migrants as well as ‘those unable to prove past residence including women fleeing domestic violence, pre-school age children and the homeless’. But the Ministry of Justice said exceptions from the residence test would have included asylum seekers, children, vulnerable people including victims of domestic violence and forced marriages, and refugees. A MoJ spokesman said: ‘Legal aid is paid for by British taxpayers and we do not believe it is fair that people without a strong connection to the UK should be eligible for civil legal aid when it is funded by taxpayers’ hard-earned money. ‘The Government believes that, in principle, people should have a strong connection to the UK in order to benefit from the civil legal aid scheme and that the residence test we proposed is a fair and appropriate way to demonstrate that connection.’","Ruling makes it illegal to ban foreigners who have never set foot in Britain from claiming legal aid .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . An asylum seeker who claimed they were 'destitute' to get thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money was found to have £74,000 in cash and illegal wages. The scandal was unearthed by the immigration watchdog in a damning report which exposed widespread fraud in the refugee system. John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said asylum fraud cost taxpayers £1.2 million a year. But he warned that the true amount was likely to be 'substantially higher'. John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said half of the recommendations in his report into the asylum system related to improvements in tackling fraud . Mr Vine said the Government was failing to tackle asylum seekers ripping off the taxpayers. The largest fraud seen by the chief inspector saw an asylum seeker handed £18,000 in support, while pocketing £74,000 from other benefits and wages from working on the side. The unnamed claimant was caught, but avoided jail - receiving a 12 month suspended sentence for fraud - and was not even asked to repay the cash even though they had £10,500 in savings. Theresa May has been ordered by the borders chief to get a grip on asylum fraud . Another asylum seeker and her husband illegally pocketed £11,000 in child benefit and child tax credit. The pair saved £10,000 of the benefits - but were only ordered to repay £6,000. Another supposedly destitute asylum seeker who was found with two laptops, a TV, several mobile phones and an exercise machine. Destitute asylum seekers can apply for 'asylum support' once they have been allowed to stay in the country. They can get free accommodation plus £36 a week if they are single or £72 for a couple. But as part of the deal they are not allowed to claim other benefits. The system costs £155 million a year - supporting 26,731 asylum seekers. In his report, Mr Vine said: 'I found no evidence that the Home Office had an effective strategy to identify and tackle fraud in the asylum support system. Work had not been undertaken to determine what its exposure to fraud risk was. 'No attempt had been made to ensure fraud and compliance teams operated in a consistent manner and there were insufficient resources dedicated to this work. As a result opportunities to identify and deter those wishing to commit fraud were lost. 'Almost half of my recommendations in this report relate to improvements in tackling fraud. The Home Office must ensure these are implemented swiftly and effectively.'","Unnamed claimant not asked to repay despite having £10,500 in savings .

A Royal Marine died during a gruelling Special Forces selection exercise when he fell into a mountain gorge not shown on the map he was given by commanders, an inquest heard. Commando Ashley Hicks, 25, slipped down a 100ft drop as he tried to reach a safe point while ‘escaping’ from other soldiers as part of the night-time training mission. He had just warned his colleagues ‘mind your footing’ as they clambered over the rocks. But seconds later, he plummeted into Maentwrog Gorge in Snowdonia, North Wales, and fell to his death. The drop was not shown on their scale map of the area. Marine Hicks, of Solihull, near Birmingham, was killed while taking part in exercises to join an elite Special Forces unit believed to be the SAS. He was part of a team climbing in the notoriously inhospitable area to test their ‘ability to adapt and survive’ in extreme conditions. They were practising the skills they had been taught to survive in the wild an escape from an enemy force. Marine Hicks volunteered to lead a team through the mountainous region while attempting to ‘evade capture’ from other soldiers. An inquest heard how they had limited equipment for the night time drill including a map with ‘little detail’ of the area. The soldiers looked at the terrain on Google Earth but the gorge was identified as a small riverbed rather than a 31-metre drop.

"By . Martin Robinson . and Larisa Brown . Rape victims were left traumatised after their attackers sent them threatening letters from their prison cells. Nicola Richardson and Jemma Myhill received ‘hostile’ letters written by their rapists while they were in prison. Last night the women, who have waived their right to anonymity, said they had been failed by a flawed victim protection system which should have kept them safe. Miss Myhill, now 19, was raped and sexually abused by her 44-year-old uncle Darren Myhill between the ages of eight and 16. Her attacker was jailed in March 2013 after admitting 22 charges of rape, indecency with a child, indecent assault and incitement against five children. Shocking: Nicola Richardson, 34, whose husband Wayne Scott was jailed for 19 years for raping her, together left, and Jemma Myhill, who was raped by her uncle, have been receiving unwanted letters from their attackers . But only a . few weeks after he was jailed, Miss Myhill, from Newcastle upon Tyne, . received a hand-written letter from Holme House Prison in . Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham. She said: . ‘A few weeks after Darren was sent to prison I was at home when I heard . the letter box clatter. I walked over to the front door to pick up the . letters. ‘One of the . letters was addressed to me and it bared a prison stamp. I ripped open . the envelope, skimmed over the writing and started to scream. I grabbed . my phone from my pocket and rang my mam. Darren had sent me a letter . from prison. ‘He had written to me telling me he knew which pubs I had been in and who I had been with. I felt sick to my stomach.’ Her mother . Julie Myhill also received a letter from the prisoner, suggesting that . she had been to blame for her daughter ‘going off the rails’. She quickly rang the probation service and they promised to step in to stop any more letters being sent to the house. Mrs Myhill . said: ‘The prison tried to suggest that the letters might have been . smuggled out, but they had the prison stamp. We still haven’t received . any apology from the prison.’ Trauma: Jemma's letters from her abusive uncle said he knew where she had been going after he was jailed . Disgraced: Written on prison paper, her uncle was able to tell her he loved her and that he wanted to kill himself . Jemma's mother Julie, who ensured her daughter's attacker had his sentenced increased, also received letters . Mrs . Richardson, who also received letters from her attacker, said: ‘I have . been told by police that prisons have lists of people inmates are not . allowed to  contact, but there are obviously flaws in the system. ‘I am disgusted that this happened at a time when I was  particularly vulnerable.’ Mrs Richardson was repeatedly raped by her husband Wayne Scott, a policeman, who has since been jailed for 19 years. Serial child rapist Darren Myhill, 44, persistantly posted letters from prison to one of his victims - his neice' But he was able to send 34-year-old Mrs Richardson at least three letters during his time in prison. The first letter was sent from Armley in Leeds where Scott, who has two children with his victim, was being held on remand. Mrs . Richardson received it in the summer of last year just a few months . after Scott was arrested. She said: ‘I had recognised the handwriting on . the envelope straight away. I felt sick. I couldn’t believe this had . been allowed to happen.’ Mrs Richardson, also from Stockton-on-Tees, . passed the letter on to police and assumed that it would be the last . time she heard from her husband. But she . received two more letters while Scott was being held in Leeds and then a . hostile one from Durham Prison where he was sent after his conviction. Prisoners have a legal right to send and receive letters in jail but their communications are supposed to be checked. Any inmates . wishing to correspond with their victims must apply to the prison . governor for permission to do so – who should in turn get in touch with . victim liaison officers before any letters leave the prison. A Prison . Service spokesman said: ‘There are very strict rules governing . correspondence and contact between offenders and their victims. ‘Any breach of these rules is unacceptable and will be dealt with swiftly and robustly.’ But Adam .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A grandmother has today spoken of her shock at finding a dead lizard wrapped in a cucumber she bought at Aldi. Jenny Wilkinson, 54, was about to chop up the vegetable and give it to her one-year-old grandson, Theo, when she spotted an unusual mark near the top. Upon further inspection, she realised the strange brown patch was a lizard that had been squashed in to the cucumber when it was vacuum-packed. Grandmother Jenny Wilkinson, 54, was about to chop up this Aldi cucumber when she noticed a strange brown mark (pictured). On closer inspection, she realised it was a lizard squashed in the packaging . Mrs Wilkinson, who was about to give the vegetable to her grandson Theo, one, says the creature must have got into the batch when the cucumbers were packaged in Holland . Mrs Wilkinson believes the small reptile must have got into the batch when the cucumbers were packaged in their country of origin - Holland. Horrified, the grandmother - who bought the 39p cucumber from a branch of Aldi in Cowes, Isle of Wight - wrote an email to the supermarket with photographs of the creature. She has since been given £20 worth of vouchers as an apology. Mrs Wilkinson, a chocolate shop owner, said: 'I was looking after my grandson, Theo, for the day and I went to Aldi to get some shopping. 'Theo is teething and loves cucumber, so I bought him some to eat when we got back home. Mrs Wilkinson had bought the cucumber for 39p from an Aldi supermarket in Cowes, Isle of Wight . 'I didn’t notice anything unusual in the shop or at the till at all. 'When . I got home I was about to take off the wrapper and chop it up when I . noticed something near one end, and when I looked closer, I realised it . was a lizard. 'It looked as though it had been splatted against the cucumber while it was being wrapped up. 'It’s a good job I noticed it because otherwise I could have fed it to Theo without realising. 'It’s worrying because it makes you wonder what else could be out there, it obviously wasn’t thoroughly checked before going on the shelf. There should be more quality control.' The company has since given the chocolate shop owner £20 in vouchers as an apology . Giles Hurley, an Aldi spokesman, said: 'We have stringent product specifications and exacting quality control measures in place to ensure the quality of all our fresh products. 'We have investigated this with our supplier and can confirm it is an isolated matter. 'We have apologised to Mrs Wilkinson and provided her with a gesture of goodwill for any inconvenience caused.'","Jenny Wilkinson, 54, was chopping up a cucumber to give to her grandson .

"By . Jason Groves . Jean-Claude Juncker laid out his vision for an increasingly federal Europe yesterday – but was heckled by Ukip members during his first speech as President of the European Commission. The former Luxembourg prime minister – whose appointment was bitterly opposed by David Cameron – was yesterday confirmed as president by a comfortable majority in a secret ballot in the European Parliament after receiving the backing of the main parties. Mr Juncker, 59, then wasted no time in demonstrating why Mr Cameron had invested so much political capital in trying to block him. Scroll down for video . Clash: Nigel Farage (left) stood up and said that the new President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker (with headphones) has no mandate . Struggling to be heard: Mr Juncker was heckled on several occasions by MEPs as he spoke on immigration and the euro, forcing Parliament President Martin Schultz to step in to call for order . In a 50-minute address, he hailed former EU president Jacques Delors – the architect of the euro – as his political ‘hero’. Setting out the priorities for his five-year term in office, Mr Juncker set himself on a collision course with Mr Cameron over a string of key issues, including immigration, human rights, employment and trade. Mr Juncker pledged to create a new commissioner with specific responsibility for the controversial Charter of Fundamental Rights. The individual will be ordered to sign the EU up to the European Convention of Human Rights – a move that would make it impossible for the UK to escape the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg court without leaving the EU. He also pledged to ‘defend’ the principle of free movement of workers within the EU, and said Brussels should do more to ‘promote labour mobility’. He said this should be matched by moves to introduce some form of European minimum wage. Mr Juncker suggested he would also like to see the development of an EU Army. And he pledged to water down Mr Cameron’s dream of a £10billion free trade deal with the United States, saying he would ‘not sacrifice Europe’s safety, health, social and data protection standards or our cultural diversity on the altar of free trade’. The new Commission president paid lip service to Britain’s demand for a looser relationship with the EU. In comments directed at the UK, he said: ‘My firm conviction is that we must move forward as a Union but not necessarily all at the same speed. ‘For some, their final destination may already have been reached. I always was and very much remain ready to listen to and help find solutions for the concerns of each and every member state.’ All smiles: UKIP leader Nigel Farage enjoys a joke with Juncker before going on to accuse the new commission president of 'being a key player in a process' that has treated democracy with contempt . Critical: Mr Farage praised Mr Juncker for being a 'political operator', but said he didn't 'believe a word' that the new president was opposed to a united states of Europe . But he was heckled by Ukip MEPs in the European parliament, with Nigel Farage saying he had no mandate. The Ukip leader told Mr Juncker: ‘What is clear is you are going to carry on with the process of the centralisation of powers. ‘We are being asked to vote for the ultimate Brussels insider, somebody who has always operated with dark, backroom deals and stitch-ups.’ Some Tories also voiced concern at Mr Juncker’s appointment. Eurosceptic MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘The EU has been shaken by the crisis of monetary union. ‘The recent elections have seen unprecedented advances by Eurosceptic parties. ‘But the answer in Brussels is still, as it always is, “more Europe”.’ The EU assembly approved Mr Juncker by a vote of 422 to 250, with 47 abstentions and ten spoiled ballots.","Jean-Claude Juncker faced jeers as he spoke on immigration and the euro .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Jurassic Coast in Dorset has been packed with treasure hunters since a giant marine reptile fossil worth £15,000 was found on a beach on Boxing Day. People come from all over the country for a day's fossil hunting along Britain's Jurassic Coast - a 96-mile-long world heritage site, which gets its name from its cliffs which were formed 180 million years ago. The near-complete ichthyosaur skeleton was discovered by hobby collector Alan Saxon, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, who was on a post-Christmas visit to the Jurassic Coast. The Jurassic Cliffs at Charmouth in Dorset have never been more busy since a fossil worth £15,000 was found on the beach on Boxing Day . Find: The skeleton - which is about 5ft long - can be seen at the base of Black Ven ner Charmouth . The 1.5m (5ft) fossil was uncovered due to heavy storms and was found at the base of Black Ven near Charmouth. The . giant marine reptile fossil was painstakingly removed over eight hours . and professional fossil hunter Paul Crossley, who helped excavate it, . said it was 'a beautiful find'. Mr Crossley told the BBC: . 'The word is already out that Lyme Regis is the capital of fossil . hunting at the moment, we've seen more people than normal on the . beaches. 'We always advise going when the tide is falling and always stay well away from the cliffs and mudslides. Use common sense.' Fossil-hunting is big business. Fossils - the remains of dead organisms preserved in rocks - can fetch millions. A fossil expert works to uncover the rare skeleton - which is worth £15,000 - discovered by hobby collector Alan Saxon . Fossil experts work to carefully remove the skeleton, pictured close-up right, on the Jurassic Coast. It took eight hours to remove . But scientists are increasingly concerned . that the lucrative market in dinosaur remains is driving a booming . illicit trade in fossil poaching. Many . experts claim that these irreplaceable ancient treasures, which are . vital for our understanding of Earth's history, are ending up not in . laboratories or museums but on the walls of business HQs, Russian . oligarchs' mansions and even, in one case, the bottom of a Japanese . billionaire's swimming pool. On . the Jurassic Coast, a fossil-collecting code allows the removal of . fossils provided the cliff-face is not damaged, and the code requires . rockhounds to notify the authorities only if a particularly important . find is made.

"By . Jaya Narain . Relaxing on a cruise ship on one of their many luxury holidays, Andrew Kenny, Victoria Tracey and their children appear to have it all. The couple drove cars with personalised number plates and had paid off the mortgage on their home despite being only in their thirties. Few in their social circle had any reason to doubt their good fortune was anything other than hard-earned. In fact their lifestyle was funded by a £65,000 benefits swindle – a crime which has now put them behind bars. Victoria Tracey and Andrew Kenny pictured enjoying a cruise in the Canary Islands paid for from their benefit fraud . Victoria Tracey and Andrew Kenny who were prosecuted by Liverpool council for benefit fraud are pictured on cruise ship Independence of the Seas . The couple told their local council . that Kenny, 39, was landlord of the property and Tracey, 33, was his . tenant, and drew up false tenancy agreements to back up their story. This enabled them to collect up to £1,200 a month on their home in Gateacre, Liverpool – enough to pay the mortgage. But . the pair were really a couple with two young children, and a third . thought to be from another relationship, who they took on the luxury . holidays with them. As he . tried desperately to maintain the sham, Kenny denied he was their father . until one fraud investigator pointed out he had tattoos with their . names and birth dates on his arms. Both Kenny and Tracey wept as they . were accused of falsely claiming the benefits over four years. Reginald . Mills, prosecuting, said: ‘This was a joint enterprise. They have acted . together to intentionally defraud money from the  public purse in order . to pay the mortgage on that house while maintaining the lifestyle that . they were living.’ Mr Mills . said Kenny insisted he wasn’t the father of his children. ‘He denied it . until it was pointed out to him that he had tattoos all over his body . that detailed the names and dates of birth of the children, at which . point he caved,’ he said. The . court heard that Tracey was able to falsely claim £35,894 in housing . benefit and income support over four years from November 2008. Kenny . received £28,145 over the same period. The couple cheated the welfare system and claimed over £65,000 in illegal benefits . Several . photographs were  produced showing the couple enjoying a variety of . luxury holidays – including cruises – with their children. On one cruise . they sailed on the Royal Caribbean Independence of the Seas liner  to . Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and Madeira. Kenny . and Tracey also bought personalised number plates for their cars, . including a silver VW Cabriolet, and paid off their mortgage early, the . court was told. Phillip Tully, defending, said Tracey was a ‘respected member of the community’ who took full responsibility for her actions. ‘This . is not someone who is a professional fraudster,’ he said. ‘She made a . very foolish decision to become involved in this and she shows genuine . remorse. ‘She was a respected member of the community who was highly thought of by people and this was totally out of character.’ Jailing . the pair for nine months each, Judge Robert Warnock said: ‘The fraud . was straightforward. Over a period of four years you maintained the . deception that you were not living in a common household. ‘The . best illustration of your greed and dishonesty is the use of defrauded . public money to pay the remortgage on your property.’ Liverpool City Council brought the prosecution and also acted on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions. A . council spokesman said: ‘During these difficult economic times, it is . more vital than ever that benefits go to those who are eligible. ‘The message from this court case is clear – you could end up behind bars if you falsely claim benefits.’","Couple swindled housing, income and child benefits to fund lifestyle .

"By . Rosemarie Lentini . It's a bittersweet first birthday for little Aurora Sky. On this day a year ago, the dark-haired infant was born three months premature by emergency Cesarean section just minutes before her mother, Brandi Lepine, died. Lepine, 17, and her friend Taylor Litwin, 21, were killed when an alleged drunk driver smashed their car as they drove to 7-Eleven for a slurpee in Canada. Now disabled Aurora is being cared for by her maternal grandmother, Josephine Ledoux, who said goodbye to her daughter and welcomed a granddaughter on the same night. Heartbreaking: Little Aurora (right) was born three months premature by emergency C-section when her mother Brandi Lepine (left) was hit by a car in Canada in July last year . Heartbreaking: Baby Aurora was born three months premature, weighing slightly more than two pounds, and suffered a head injury during the car wreck while still inside her mother's womb . 'It’s a gift, because she’s (Aurora's) come so far and it’s going to be a year tomorrow. And she has fought a lot, just to be here today,' Ledoux told CKOM. 'It’s kind of hard for me because . honestly my daughter isn’t here to celebrate her baby’s first birthday . and that’s what’s hard for me to understand... But at least . family will be around her, and friends, and she knows that she’s loved.' Even though she was still in the womb, little Aurora suffered a serious head injury in the collision. Weighing slightly more than two pounds, she spent five months in Saskatoon’s Royal University Hospital, where doctors placed a shunt in her head to drain fluid from brain. Now at her grandmother's Prince Albert home, she is connected to an oxygen tank and takes medication every day. She can't walk or crawl, and can barely hold her head up on her own. Doctors say she will likely have some form of disability for the rest of her life. Nurturing: Little Aurora is now being looked after by her maternal grandmother Josie Ledoux . Then and now: Aurora weighed about two pounds when she was induced a year ago (left) and now, aged one, has not met the milestones of children her age (right) 'People say she's (Aurora) lucky to have us, but no, we're lucky to have her in our lives,' Ledoux told CTV News. 'I don't care how she turns out ... To my eyes she's beautiful. She's a gift and we're very blessed.' Last week, Ledoux attended the preliminary trial for the allegedly drunk driver who crashed into her daughter's car. Jeremiah Jobb, 22, is facing several charges including impaired driving causing death. Family members of the victims were outraged when Jobb was granted bail in August last year. Accused: Jeremiah Jobb, now 22, was allegedly drunk when he fatally crashed his car in Canada last year . CKOM reported one member of the family pounded the walls and screamed in the halls of a Prince Albert courtroom when Judge Morris Baniak released Jobb. As a condition of his bail, the judge ordered that Jobb remain at his mother's home and only leave to go to work. He was also forbidden from drinking alcohol or going anywhere where he could buy booze. Police said Jobb was drunk when he crashed his car. Litwin died at the scene while Lepine was rushed to hospital where she died. The best friends were on their way to a 7Eleven to satisfy a hankering for a slushy drink. Days later, Lepine and Litwin were buried side by side under a tree at a local cemetery. Litwin's griefstricken mother, Bev Gobeil, said she still struggles with her daughter's death and can't imagine how Ledoux is coping with a special-needs child. 'I don't know how that woman can do it, man. She's got to be strong,' Gobeil told CTV News. 'It would be hard to handle that baby. Every day you think of your girl.' Both families have planned a potluck supper tonight at a church to remember the young women and celebrate Aurora's birthday. Victim: Brandi Lepine's friend Taylor Litwin, 21 (pictured) was also killed in the horrific 14 July, 2013, car crash . 'I'll never forget my daughter,' Ledoux said. 'I'll never forget her smile, her laughter, her silliness. The one . thing I miss the most is her just hugging me and just kissing me really . hard on the face and saying, 'I love you Mom'.' She said she will never keep Aurora in the dark about her mother. 'She's not ever going to know her mom but I will tell her stories and show her pictures. That's all I can do,' she said. Ledoux said her quiet but headstrong daughter dropped out of high school when she found out she was pregnant, but vowed to return after the baby was born.  Ledoux promised her daughter, who had broken up with her boyfriend, that she and her husband would raise the baby.","Six-months-pregnant Brandi Lepine, 17, and her friend Taylor Litwin, 21, killed after a car crash in Prince Albert, Canada on July 14, 2013 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Police were called to deal with angry shoppers yesterday after a 99p shop stopped its half-price closing down sale mid-afternoon. Crowds of bargain-hunters who'd gone to the 99p Store in Wrexham specially for the 'Everything 50p' sale refused to leave after store managers said they weren't closing down after all and were putting prices back up to 99p. They told shoppers - some of whom had queued for hours - that they’d renegotiated their lease at the last minute, so the sale was off, but it wasn't enough to placate the crowds who refused to move until prices came down again. No entry: Police were called to calm shoppers at the 99p Store in Wrexham after its 50p sale was cancelled . Officers negotiated with shoppers inside the store, many of whom said they'd queued for up to two hours . Police sealed the doors to stop any more shoppers coming in, and the stand-off was only ended after two hours when bosses at the Regent Street discount shop negotiated a 'buy one, get one free' offer. Once the shoppers inside had bought everything they wanted, store workers took down its posters in the window saying that everything was half-price until January 28, and the 99p Store opened its doors again with everything back up to full price. Sharon Roberts, from Rhosnesni, north Wales, said: 'I was in there for nearly two hours queuing to get to the till. Then the manager took the posters down from the window. 'People were absolutely furious and that’s why the police were called. Tempers were flaring and people were shouting. 'The shop finally said people could have items on a buy one get one free basis.' Phil Smith, from Brymbo, said: 'They dropped all the prices to 50p until January 28, and there were queues of about 40 to 50 people all day. Then the manager came around saying everything is back up to 99p. Bare shelves: Crowds of shoppers cleared the shelves in the 99p Store in Wrexham when it halved its prices .

'I just dropped my basket where I was and fought my way out through the crowds,” she said. 'It is the principle of it: they said everything was 50p, not 99p. It was a joke.' 'It all kicked off.  Nobody in that queue was willing to leave or pay the 99p.  People were so angry.' - Lorna Jones, shopper . Lorna Jones, from Caia Park, had to take her young child out of the store as he had become distressed by the angry scenes. 'It all kicked off,' she said. 'Nobody in that queue was willing to leave or pay the 99p. People were so angry.' Yesterday morning the store had posters in the window saying prices on all items had been slashed to 50p until January 28, when the store was to shut down because the lease on the building was up. The store later said a lease had been agreed after talks with the landlord, safeguarding 33 jobs. Tony Brown, chief operating officer for 99p Stores said: 'We genuinely regret the way this was handled. We should have closed the doors and let everybody get out with their items. 'But we are happy we have now arranged for the store to stay open and the jobs have been secured.'

"By . Mike Dawes . Yorkshireman Danny Willett was able to laugh off a stiff neck and shoulder and an amateur-like shank at his last hole as he maintained his share of the lead at the BMW International Open in Cologne. The 26-year-old saw his 155-yard approach to the ninth - the last of his second round - veer wildly off to the right, narrowly clearing the water guarding the adjacent 18th green and coming up just short of the putting surface. From there the 2012 champion saved par to keep a bogey off his card as he finished with a 68 - matched by playing partner and co-leader Rafa Cabrera-Bello - to post 12 under for 36 holes. Flying high: Danny Willett has maintained his share of the lead at the BMW International Open in Cologne . They were later joined by another Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal and Argentinian Emiliano Grillo. 'Twelve under was great score for two days and the shoulder was good early on,' Willett, who missed Wednesday's pro-am because of his neck problem, told European Tour Radio. 'I completely forgot to take any pills after nine holes and I could feel it in the last few holes. 'The only thing you can do is laugh as it (the shank) is not something that happens very often.' Cabrera-Bello's round was not without incident either as he called a penalty on himself for a double-hit at the par-five seventh after clipping the ball twice hitting out of the greenside rough, resulting in his only bogey of the day. Larrazabal, winner in 2011, shot a best of the day 63 which was matched by Wirral golfer Paul Waring who narrowly missed a birdie putt at the last to close on nine under. Battling on: Willett, pictured holding his shoulder, missed Wednesday's pro-am because of a neck problem . Argentinian Grillo was five under through 11 holes but finished with a 66, although that was still good enough for a share of top spot. The 21-year-old admits his performances over the last two days have helped put a smile back on his face. Eyes on the prize: Pablo Larrazabal shot a best of the day 63 . 'It's been a rough couple of months personally and on the golf course so I'm happy with the week so far,' he said. 'My dad passed away in December so it has been a long six months dealing with everything you have to deal with back home. 'I've learned a lot of things about life with that and I think I am growing up fast.' An approaching late afternoon thunderstorm forced a suspension in play and halted the charge of Nuneaton's Andy Sullivan, who was six under for 11 holes of his round and in a share of first place but eventually finished nine under after a double bogey at his last. Denmark's Andreas Harto, who in 14 events this season has yet to win a single euro in prize money, made his first cut of the year after a round of 66 moved him to within two of the leaders to guarantee him a payday of at least £2,900 - although if he maintains his position in the top 10 he will receive more than 10 times that amount. Harto was in the pack at 10 under alongside South African Branden Grace, Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez, German Alex Cejka, Sweden's Robert Karlsson and Scot Craig Lee. US Open champion and home favourite Martin Kaymer, on his first appearance since winning his second major at Pinehurst earlier this month, missed the cut after a 73 left him one over.","Danny Willett maintained share of the lead at BMW International Open .

'I was able to get to within two metres for this shot with before the yak snorted and became defensive. I took that as my cue to head home and left him to his blanket of spring snow.' Also getting a coating of snow was this church nestled between two trees at the top of a hill in Slovenia.

The FA and PFA have so far failed to publish any findings from a joint 10-year study promised after former England forward Jeff Astle's death in 2002 which a coroner found was due to 'industrial disease' caused by heading footballs. Concern: The FA and PFA have so far failed to publish any findings from a joint 10-year study promised after Jeff Astle's death in 2002 . Astle's widow Laraine has repeatedly asked to meet FA chairman Greg Dyke after he wrote to her in April apologising for the FA's behaviour following a Sportsmail investigation which discovered the study had, according to one insider, been 'kicked into the long grass'. Mrs Astle also revealed she wrote to Dyke two weeks ago after her husband's brain was re-examined and he was found to have CTE - a degenerative disease found in the brains of boxers, rugby players and American Footballers - but has had no response.

David de Gea (Man United, signed for £19m), Alvaro Arbeloa (Real Madrid, £3.5m), Gerard Pique (Barcelona, £5m), Carles Puyol (Barcelona), Nacho Monreal (Arsenal, £8.5m), Javi Garcia (Manchester City £15.8m), Isco (Real Madrid, £23m), Juan Mata (Man United £37.2m), Fernando Torres (Chelsea, £50m), Fernando Llorente (Juventus, free), David Villa (Atletico Madrid, £4.4m) Combined market value: £166.4m . When people discuss who will be lifting the World Cup on June 13, England barely register. Hosts Brazil, Argentina, Germany and holders Spain tend to be most people’s pick. An optimistic punter may even have a flutter on dark horses like Italy, Holland or even Belgium, but Roy Hodgson’s side are given scant chance of winning their second World Cup this time around. One reason for this pessimism is the strength of the squad at Hodgson's disposal when compared to the giants of Europe and South America. For instance, a slick, strong Spain squad face Italy on Wednesday evening, boasting the likes of Sergio Ramos, Xabi Alonso, Andres Iniesta and Manchester City duo Alvaro Negredo and David Silva. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Juan Mata, David De Gea and Fernando Torres . Out: Manchester United duo David de Gea (right) and Juan Mata (left) have not been included in Spain's squad . Spanish connection: But Javi Garcia (centre right) is not in Spain's XI to take on Italy . Goal threat: Fernando Llorente celebrates after scoring against Milan at the weekend . In the cold: David Villa (right) is out of the squad but team-mate Diego Costa will make his debut against Italy . Casillas, Reina, Valdes; Juanfran, Albiol, Ramos, Martinez, Jordi Alba, Azpilicueta; Xavi, Busquets, Alonso, Koke, Iniesta, Cazorla, Fabregas, Thiago Alcantara, Silva; Negredo, Navas, Pedro, Diego Costa . But there are a number of Spain players who could do some serious damage on the world stage who haven’t been included in Vicente del Bosque’s party for the Madrid game. In fact, we’ve compiled an alternative Spain XI of players who haven’t made Del Bosque’s squad. Among them are Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, Real Madrid’s fledgling playmaker Isco and Atletico Madrid hotshot David Villa. United's £37million signing Juan Mata isn't involved and Juventus hitman Fernando Llorente has also been overlooked. Villa and Chelsea's £50m signing Fernando Torres were part of the Spain set-up for their historic three consecutive major-tournament wins, but both have been omitted to make way for Atletico Madrid's Brazil-born striker Diego Costa and Negredo. Of our XI, only Barcelona’s Gerard Pique is injured - but the remainder have been left out or rested - and this team would surely prove difficult opposition if pitted against, say, England. Then and now: Fernando Torres lifts the European Championship trophy (left) but the Chelsea man may find it difficult to force his way into the team with the likes of Alvaro Negredo and Diego Costa finding the goals . Battle on the left: Barcelona's Jordi Alba (left) is keeping Nacho Monreal out of the Spain side . Mixed bag: Gerard Pique (left) looks certain to be in Brazil but will Llorente be part of another winning team? In fact, almost all of them would waltz straight into Roy Hodgson's starting line-up. Each one is a regular in a Champions League knock-out-stage team and have a combined value of around £166m. Admittedly, Del Bosque will field a mix of experienced and fringe players against the Italians, but Spain’s astonishing strength in depth isn’t just a worry for England. The fact that they have eleven players that haven’t made the squad for one of the final friendlies before their World Cup defence who have accrued millions of pounds in transfers and a ton of silverware should send shivers through the spines of the other big nations heading into the tournament. Brazil seemed to manage OK in the Confederations Cup final at the Maracana, mind. Not this time: Carles Puyol (left) and Alvaro Arbeloa won't take part in the match against Cesare Prandelli's men . Starlet: Real Madrid playmaker Isco was a shining star at the European Under 21 Championships . A striking difference: The men who could leave Torres in the cold . Fernando Torres, who has won three consecutive major tournaments with Spain, may struggle to force his way into the squad after being dropped along with David Villa for the upcoming friendly against Italy. Vicente del Bosque likes to deploy one man up top, and it appears as though Torres is not his man. Alvaro Negredo has embraced the rough and tumble of the Premier League since joining Manchester City last summer from Sevilla. He's also operated well as the spearhead of Del Bosque's in recent qualifiers and friendlies. Lethal: Alvaro Negredo . U-Turn: Costa now plays for Spain . Flying: Pedro is in good form . On the wane? Villa (left) and Torres have been left out for the friendly against Italy . Meanwhile, Diego Costa has decided to . play for Spain over Brazil. Del Bosque will find it hard to ignore a . player who has netted 26 times this season with Atletico Madrid, despite . his penchants for controversy. Barcelona . have another attacking gem in Pedro. The fleet-footed wide man isn't as . advanced as an out-and-out striker, but he's versatile and his ability . to ghost in from the flank has seen him snatch 14 goals so far this . campaign. And then there's . Villa. At 32, he hasn't hit the heights of his earlier career in terms . of goals, but has built up a solid partnership with Costa at Atletico. Villa has managed to find the back of the net 11 times this season . Those who aren't in Del Bosque's squad just yet needn't be too concerned though. 'This list is exclusively for the game against Italy,"" He said after announcing his 22 players.

"By . Anna Edwards . A council has spent £42,000 of taxpayers' money on shuttling workers to a call centre 524ft away in taxis. Lincolnshire County Council collects and drops off dozens of customer service workers for the 160m journey across the River Witham. The trips might be tiny, but they cost the taxpayer £7,000 a year and have run for six years. Map . But the Conservative-led council has defended its decision to drop workers off, claiming that they had a 'duty of care' to staff, who had raised concerns about walking to work in the dark. Zoe Butler, head of the customer service centre, said: 'During a staff survey a few years ago, safety concerns were raised by those who walk to and from Witham Park House and the Spa Road area during the winter months. 'The majority of staff are female and, as a responsible employer, the council agreed to provide transport from November until March at the beginning and end of the day. 'Currently the service is mainly used by staff from our Customer Service Centre and other colleagues within Witham Park House. The trips might be tiny, but they cost the taxpayer £7,000 a year and have run for six years . 'The road is due to be upgraded this year, which will provide a safer walking route for our staff, and remove the need for transport in future years.' She said there had been some incidents which involved the police being called, the BBC reported, but officers told The Sun that there had been no reports of attacks or serious crime. The service runs between 8am and 9.30am and 3.30pm until 6pm from November until March. A Lincolnshire County Council spokesman said: ' Robert Oxley, campaign director for the Taxpayers' Alliance, told both The Sun and the BBC: 'It seems an utterly absurd waste of taxpayers' money to provide cabs for a hundred metre journey. 'Employers should encourage staff to take responsibility for their safety. 'It's difficult to imagine that any other employer not funded by taxpayers would think cabs are an appropriate solution to such a short distance.' Safety concerns were raised by those who walk to and from Witham Park House and the Spa Road area during the winter months, the council said . Lincolnshire County Council has been criticised before about how they spend taxpayers' money. It spent money paying famous musicians their royalties so that they could use their songs as 'hold music' while residents waited for their calls to be answered. The authority discovered more modern easy-listening chart songs - such as Abba and Billy Ocean - dramatically reduced the number of people hanging up. Lincolnshire County Council said the number of people who hang up while on hold has more than halved since piping commercial tracks down the telephone to those in the queue. Lincolnshire is one of a handful of authorities to have ditched traditional hold music in favour of easy-listening chart songs, which require royalty payments to the Performing Rights Society (PRS). Councillor Richard Davies, executive member for highways at Lincolnshire County Council, said: . 'People can be kept waiting for a few minutes at peak times so we use commercial songs for our on-hold music. Quite frankly, our callers love it. 'It costs just £175 per year and since we introduced it, we have reduced our abandoned call rate by half - from 4,000 calls per month to just 1,600. 'I would, however, like to take this opportunity to apologise for our use of the Lighthouse Family’s Ocean Drive. I accept this was a deplorable lapse in judgement and we deserve all the criticism we get. 'In our defence, it was either that or M People’s Moving On Up.'","Shuttles customer service workers for 160m journey across River Witham .

Ian Wright has spoken of the 'terrifying' moment an armed gang held a Stanley knife to his wife's throat and threatened to cut off her fingers before they fled with family possessions including the former Arsenal and England star's MBE. The 50-year-old pundit had to cut short his work for ITV at the World Cup in Brazil to look after wife Nancy, 39, and their daughters, aged four and two, following the raid on Wednesday night. Wright went straight to a waiting car which whisked him back to his family after his 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro landed at London's Heathrow airport on Thursday lunchtime. After rushing into his home in Queen's Park, north-west London, he later emerged to confirm that everyone was safe and his wife was 'feeling good that I'm back'. Speaking to The Sun, he said the men who were wearing masks barged in after Nancy opened the door at 9.15pm. 'They threatened to cut her fingers off and even threatened to do the same to the children, who were both upstairs in their bedrooms. 'Nancy was praying the children wouldn't wake up. 'It would have been devastating for them to see what was happening.' According to Wright, the men were hysterically shouting at Nancy to show them where the family safe was and marched her from room to room. When the safe was found, Nancy pleaded with the men to stop and said she would open it if they stopped pushing her around. Wright confirmed the MBE he was given by the Queen in 2000 for services to football was taken alongside rare watches. One of the watches was given to him by former Arsenal team-mate Dennis Bergkamp while the other was an Arsenal watch with an inscription from the club. However, Wright said the main thing was that his family was safe. Scroll down for videos .

London shortly after 9pm before making off with personal possessions. Police believe the family could have been followed home from a nearby park. The suspects are described as black, aged . between 18 and 25, with London accents, wearing dark clothing and . hoodies obscuring their faces, he added. No arrests have been made. Wright added: 'What's really disappointing is they're from an age group I've worked with and tried to help.' Wright confirmed the MBE he was given by the Queen in 2000 for services to football was taken . A . spokesman for Wright said today that he was left 'really upset and angry' after learning of the horrific incident/ . He . said: 'We are very grateful to ITV for being so supportive and getting him back so quickly. Nancy . is really shaken up. Their kids are so young that hopefully they aren't . going to read into it too much. They are all physically OK - Nancy and . the kids. 'Ian is just really upset and angry and just wants to come back and be with his family at this time.' Asked . if they had received any update on whether police have tracked down the . raiders, he added: 'Nancy may have, but we haven't heard anything . further from the police at this time.' The spokesman said Wright hoped other footballers and pundits over in Brazil covering . the tournament would not also become a target for robbers. Painstaking: Police searched every inch of the area around Mr Wright's north London home . It is understood four men armed with knives stormed their way into his home shortly after 9pm .

Nancy (pictured with Wright at a charity event in 2008) is said to have been threatened by the four-man gang . Wright, pictured with fellow pundit Glenn Hoddle, has been following the England team for his work for ITV . He said: 'Hopefully, with enough media coverage, this won't happen to any . other players or people who are over in the World Cup. Ian is trying to . get the message out.' An ITV spokesman said: 'Ian travelled . home immediately to be with his family on hearing the shocking news. Our . thoughts and best wishes are with them.' Front door close-up: One the raiders told another to 'punch her, kill her' (Wright's wife) as they entered the property . Wright's neighbours expressed their shock at the robbery today and described him as a 'lovely family man'. Next-door neighbour Marianne Collinge, 70, said: 'I suppose they could be a bit of a target because they do have beautiful cars. 'But they are very unpretentious people. They are one of us and I'm terribly sorry for them, it's awful.' Chris . Martin, a neighbour in his 50s, said: 'We were watching the Spain game . when the police arrived last night and that's all we know about it. 'Ian . is a neighbour and a decent family man. He's been living here several . years and everyone around here respects his privacy.' Well-wishers today took flowers to Wright's door and posted messages through his letterbox, while police made door-to-door inquiries. Scotland Yard said it was investigating an aggravated burglary at an address in north-west London after they were called at 9.20pm last night. Four men, believed to be armed with knives, forced their way inside the house and stole a number of items, including personal property and jewellery, a police spokesman said. Detective Chief Inspector Mick Gornall, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are trying to trace these four men, and I'd ask anyone who may know anything to get in touch with my team and help us. 'Fortunately no one was injured during the burglary, but it is still very frightening to have people force their way into your home and threaten you. 'Last night officers went to the address and started carrying out house-to-house inquiries. We are also seizing and reviewing CCTV.' Gary Lineker, who is fronting coverage of the World Cup for the BBC, offered Wright his support this afternoon .

Glasgow bound: Usain Bolt has confirmed his availability for the Commonwealth Games . Star of the show: Bolt's participation in Glasgow next month may only be limited to the relay . Jamaica have yet to name their athletics team for Glasgow, although former 100m world champion Yohan Blake has already declared himself unavailable, prompting further questions about why Team England’s squad was announced on June 16 and selected two weeks previously. The early cut-off time for qualification meant Britain’s current fastest male 100m runner, Chijindu Ujah, missed out on selection as he did not run 9.96secs in Hengelo, Holland until June 8. The oversight means Ujah will instead concentrate on guaranteeing his place in Great Britain’s team for August’s European Championships in Zurich by finishing in the top two at this weekend’s Sainsbury’s British Championships in Birmingham. The 20-year-old’s coach, Jonas Taiwah-Dodoo, believes Ujah is capable of dipping under 9.9secs this season, putting him on course to break Linford Christie’s British record of 9.87secs, and could also win his first senior medal in Zurich. Cohorts: Bolt celebrates with team-mate Yohan Blake following the 200-metre final during London 2012 . Unavailable: Blake won't compete in the Commonwealth Games for Jamaica . Taiwah-Dodoo said: ‘I would expect him . to get faster. With the same conditions as Hengelo, can he run 9.8secs? I don’t see why not. And can he go to Europeans and challenge for a . medal?

"By . Hugo Gye . A patient died after being forced to wait in an ambulance for four hours because a hospital's A&E department was too busy to admit him. The 58-year-old man fell ill last Thursday and was taken to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales. However, the emergency unit was 'extremely busy', and the patient had to spend four hours waiting outside, during which time he was assessed by a doctor. Two hours after finally being admitted to A&E, his condition deteriorated and he died. Investigation: Bosses at Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, pictured, are probing the death of patient who was forced to wait in an ambulance outside A&E for four hours . Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board, which is responsible for the hospital, had previously warned that its A&E services were becoming overstretched due to the high level of admissions. Hospital bosses urged patients to avoid the emergency unit after 18 operations had to be cancelled thanks to overcrowding. And last month, it emerged that one patient in Wales had been forced to wait in an ambulance for more than six hours as campaigners warned of a crisis in A&E across Britain. Police are currently investigating the death of the 58-year-old in Bridgend in preparation for an inquest to be held by the coroner. In addition, the ABMU health board has launched a review to determine whether the man's death may have been preventable. The board said in a statement: 'We are deeply saddened to report the death of a patient in the emergency department of the Princess of Wales Hospital on January 16. We wish to express our sincere condolences to the patient's family. Tragic: The man was forced to remain in the ambulance because A&E was too busy for him (file photo) 'The patient was admitted to the department at 11am and two hours later became suddenly very unwell. Despite efforts by staff to resuscitate him he later died. 'Prior to being admitted to the department, the patient was in an ambulance, attended by paramedics, for over four hours. The Princess of Wales hospital emergency department was extremely busy at the time and unfortunately there were delays admitting patients as a result. The patient was assessed by a doctor while in the ambulance. 'The coroner has been informed of his death and the health board is carrying out an urgent review of the case to ascertain what lessons can be learned and if this very sad death could have been avoided.' South Wales Police confirmed they were aware of the death, and are now preparing a report for the coroner. The Welsh Government said it expected a 'full investigation' to be carried out, adding: 'We are sorry to hear of this tragic incident and our thoughts are with the family at this very difficult time.' A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service said: 'We are saddened to hear of this patient's death following their conveyance to hospital last Thursday, January 16, and extend our deepest condolences to the family. 'Handover delays are of great concern to us and we are looking into this matter internally. We will fully support our health board colleagues and the coroner with their investigations.' Anger: Raymond Osborne, 64, says he had to wait for 20 hours before being given a hospital bed . A retired postman claims he had to wait . for more than 20 hours for a bed in a hospital after being admitted with . chest pain and breathing problems. Bosses . at Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands are . investigating the treatment of Raymond Osborne, 64, who suffers from . arthritis, asthma and diabetes. He . says that after nine hours in A&E he was due to be moved to a bed - . but instead he spent almost 12 hours waiting outside the ward. 'My treatment was disgusting,' he said. 'I considered lying on the floor to get some rest. 'Elderly . ladies also waited for four hours or more in the chairs too. One of . them was even sick in front of me. It was absolutely awful. 'My whole body was swollen due to my arthritis and I could hardly move my right hand.' Mr . Osborne, from Erdington, arrived at Good Hope around 1am on January 10, . after experiencing breathing difficulties and chest pain. At . 9.30am, he said an A&E consultant told him medics wanted him to go . to the Observation Ward, so he was taken in a wheelchair and told to sit . on a row of chairs. He said he was finally given a bed on the ward at 9.35pm - but was discharged less than an hour later. 'I have been having treatment at the hospital a long time and recently it has gone down the pan,' Mr Osborne said. A spokesman for Good Hope said: 'We take all feedback very seriously and are very sorry to learn about Mr Osborne's experience. 'This is not what we want for our patients and we are currently investigating the issue Mr Osborne has raised.

"By . Mike Dawes . World triple jump champion Teddy Tamgho has been banned for a year for missing three drug tests in an 18-month period, the French Athletics Federation has announced. The Frenchman, the third longest jumper in history, will be suspended until March 17 next year.Tamgho, who became only the third man to go over 18 metres when he leapt 18.04m to win the world title in Moscow last August, had not been expected to compete this summer anyway after suffering a fractured tibia in November. The 25-year-old will also now miss the 2015 indoor season, but will be back in plenty of time for the defence of his world crown in Beijing that August. Banned: France's Teddy Tamgho is not able to compete for one year . The federation's disciplinary board's decision said Tamgho had missed tests on 19 December 2012 and 28 January and 18 March 2014. His suspension was backdated to March 18. But the board accepted Tamgho had not sought to deliberately skip the drug tests. 'The board does not doubt the good faith of the athlete. The attitude of Teddy Tamgho is more neglect and lack of diligence than a genuine desire to evade doping controls,' it said in its decision.Tamgho has 45 days to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The controversial athlete burst on to the global scene by winning the world indoor title in Doha in 2010 with a then indoor world record of 17.90m. His career has been troubled by disciplinary and injury problems.

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . England's Danny Willett fired his second hole-in-one in the space of two months on his way to a course-record 63 that vaulted him into contention for the Irish Open on Saturday. Willett's previous ace earnt him a V40 Cross Country from the tournament sponsors in the final round of the Volvo China Open at the end of April. And although the 26-year-old did not win anything for his 'slam dunk' effort on the seventh hole at Fota Island - a £65,000 BMW 640 Gran Coupe was on offer on the 13th - it sparked a brilliant round and helped set the clubhouse target of 11 under par. Good form: England's Danny Willett has put himself in contention for the Irish Open title . 'We had a perfect number, 168 yards with an eight iron but you never expect it to slam dunk,' Willett said. 'That was a bit of a bonus.' Fresh from finishing 45th on his US Open debut at Pinehurst last week, Willett had already birdied the fourth and added another at the eighth to reach the turn in 32. The former English Amateur champion's challenge was slowed by a run of four straight pars on the back nine, but he then birdied four of the last five holes to beat the previous course record of 64 set by Mikko Ilonen on Thursday. 'We've been playing great for a long time but could not seem to get anything going on the greens,' added Willett, whose sole European Tour title to date came in the BMW International Open in 2012. 'But holing a wedge yesterday (for an eagle on the second) and an eight iron today certainly helps. 'Coming from the US Open last week it was a slightly different mentality, it was quite tricky to stop playing 20 feet away from the flags and on the first day we were too cautious. 'There's a score out there and it just depends if anyone takes it, but a good round today has put us in a good position.' In the lead: Finland's Mikko Ilonen is ahead in Ireland . Ilonen had led ever since his opening 64 and remained top of the leaderboard midway through his round, birdies on the second and third taking the Finn to 12 under par. Playing partner Robert Rock was a shot behind Willett on 10 under after three birdies and one bogey on the front nine, with England's Matthew Baldwin and Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti safely in the clubhouse on nine under following rounds of 66 and 65 respectively. Former US Open champion Graeme McDowell was a shot behind on eight under after a birdie on the 11th repaired some of the damage caused by bogeys on the eighth and ninth.","Finland's Ilonen leads the pack but Willett plays ace to shuffle the pack .

"By . Ben Spencer . Exposing newborn babies to germs could help prevent asthma as they grow up, research suggests.The findings bolster the theory that modern obsession with hygiene and cleanliness has driven a boom in allergies and health problems. According to the 'hygiene hypothesis', exposure to bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life. Many scientists believe that modern society, with its mania for sanitation and easy access to antibiotics, makes children hypersensitive to harmless allergens. Researchers believe that exposing children to germs as babies could help them avoid asthma in later life . The latest work, published last night in the journal Nature Medicine, may lead to bacterial treatments in which germs are intentionally fed to infants. The scientists found that when newborn mice were exposed to allergens they were better able to ward off asthma. Other studies have already shown that airway exposure to bacteria can be effective at controlling allergy-driven airway inflammation in adult mice, the scientists said. The team, led by Dr Benjamin Marsland, from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, wrote: 'Our current study indicates that such treatments could be greatly optimised by targeting the narrow developmental window that exists following birth, or by targeting specific molecules. 'A key future step will be to translate these findings to human infants.' More than five million people in the UK are undergoing treatment for asthma, including 1.1 million children. Around 1,250 Britons die from asthma every year and mortality rate is the third highest in Europe, behind only Estonia and Spain. The latest figures, released last week, show that the numbers have been steadily rising since 2009 when there were 1,140 deaths. Asthma attacks are caused by an over-strong inflammatory immune response to allergy triggers such as house dust mites, pets or air pollutants. The study showed that newborn mice were vulnerable to inflammation in the lungs when exposed to allergens. But when their lungs were colonised by microbes, they developed immune cells that are anti-inflammatory and can suppress asthma. The regulatory T cells kept the immune system in check and suppressed the inflammation.Keeping mice in sterile conditions to prevent this colonisation rendered them sensitive to bugs and resulted in asthma as adults. Interaction with a protein called PD-L1 was vital to the development of these cells, the researchers found. When PD-L1 was blocked, it had the same effect as keeping out the microbes - an exaggerated response to allergy triggers that persisted into adulthood. Figures show that 1.1 million children in the UK suffer from asthma (picture posed by a model) The scientists wrote: 'Overall, the concept of early developmental windows of allergic lung disease based on microbial colonisation represents a change in mainstream pathophysiological paradigms and presents unique opportunities for future post-natal modification of disease risk.' Evidence is growing to support the hygiene hypothesis. In 2011, in a study of 1,400 children, researchers at Yale University in the U.S. found that babies who received antibiotics had a 70 per cent higher risk of suffering from asthma in childhood. The scientists thought the asthma risk may have been caused by the fact that the antibiotics have wiped out swathes of bacteria - good and bad - in the babies' bodies. They suggested the drugs had deprived the young immune systems of a healthy benchmark of normality on which to base their development. In the years before antibiotics and scrupulous hygiene, our immune systems were used to bacteria and learnt to ignore this as non-hazardous. But in a overly sanitary environment, the immune system can over-react to minor provocations, such as harmlessly low levels of bacteria. American professor Rob Dunn, author of The Wild Life of Our Bodies, believes we should convince our bodies they are still in the natural state of our ancestors. Professor Dunn, of North Carolina State University, said: 'We have gone from lives immersed in nature to lives in which nature has disappeared. 'But our bodies continue to expect to meet our old companions, the parasite species with which they tangled for generation upon generation.' The latest research comes after a major report last week concluded that Britain is failing to cope with the country's asthma problem. Up to 800 patients are dying needlessly from asthma every year because doctors are prescribing the wrong medication or failing to properly monitor them, according to the Royal College of Physicians. The report found that prescription errors had occurred in half of deaths while many other patients had not been offered check-ups or key advice on how to manage the condition and avoid attacks.","Experts believe that exposing children to bacteria could prime immune system .

"By . Tara Brady . A father and his daughter have become the first pilot team to fly for British Airways. Captain David Woodruffe and his daughter Senior First Officer Kat Woodruffe both fly Boeing 777s for the airliner. Kat, 32, grew up in awe of her jet-set father, who has been flying commercial jets to some of the most glamorous destinations across the world for more than 40 years. British heir-ways: Captain David Woodruffe and his daughter Senior First Officer Kat Woodruffe both fly for BA . The pair both qualified and began their flying careers at the age of 20 and now both fly Boeing 777s for British Airways. Father-of-two David, 61, from Horsham, West Sussex, said: 'I am extremely proud of Kat and of course I’m delighted that she has carried on the family tradition. Flying is clearly in our genes. 'She was absolutely determined to become a pilot, ever since she was a little girl. She focused her education and training on it. 'She never wavered from that career path - it is all she has ever wanted to do. The pair both qualified and began their flying careers at the age of 20 and now both fly Boeing 777s for BA . Kat always wanted to be like her father who has been flying commercial jets for more than 40 years . The duo insist that once at the controls, their relationship is strictly professional and there is no rivalry . 'I am very proud of her, British Airways is a very difficult airline to get into.' Kat, who also lives in Horsham, said: 'My dad was my inspiration to become a pilot. I grew up watching him put on his uniform and flying around the world. 'Dad used to take me on a lot of trips when I was younger. 'I was about eight years-old when I just knew that it was what I wanted to do. 'I absolutely love flying, just everything about it - the glamour, the professionalism. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else. 'And I get to fly to my favourite destinations for work - my favourite place is Barbados.' Captain David Woodruffe as a young pilot (left) and (right) his daughter Kat sat in a cockpit as a child . Mother-of-one Kat earned her wings as a commercial pilot 12-years-ago and has been flying777 commercial planes with BA since 2005. The pair have even been lucky enough to share a cockpit and have flown together on several occasions to destinations including New York, Chicago and Abu Dhabi. However, the duo insist that once at the controls, their relationship is strictly professional and there is no father-daughter rivalry. Father-of-two David Woodruffe said he is extremely proud of his daughter Kat who followed in his footsteps . Kat always dreamed of becoming a pilot just like her father David and went on to qualify at the age of 20 . Mr Woodruffe said: 'We have been lucky enough to fly together several times and of course it’s extra special to have with my daughter at the controls with me. 'But all British Airways’ pilots are trained to the same high standards so on paper it makes no difference who you’re flying with. We are both very professional. 'It is nice though, as we fly to the same long-haul destinations so we can meet up while we are away and compare notes on restaurants and things to do. 'I try to avoid flying with her too much though as it always seems to cost me money. Like father, like daughter: Captain David Woodruffe and Senior First Officer Kat Woodruffe . 'Whenever we meet up or are in the same place together she always mysteriously loses her credit card or has left it at home.' Kat is now hoping that her own daughter, 13-month-old Poppy, may continue the family tradition and also grow up to work in the ‘family trade’. She said: 'I am a mum myself now and I would absolutely love it if my daughter decided to carry on the tradition and followed in our footsteps as well. 'To become a mummy-daughter pilot team would be lovely.'","Kat Woodruffe always wanted to be a pilot like her father David Woodruffe .

"By . Lydia Warren . A terminally-ill cancer patient has entered rehab to kick his secret addiction to painkillers so that he can die drug free. John Eggers, a 48-year-old former attorney who was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor last year, admitted to KTLA that he had been struggling with the addiction after originally taking opiates for a sore back. 'I'm in an extremely dark place, a place where you can never imagine being,' he told the channel, which has documented his attempts to complete a bucket list as he battles the disease. Scroll down for video . Coming clean: John Eggers, a former attorney with terminal cancer, has revealed he checked into rehab so he could kick an addiction to painkillers and die drug free - the latest item on his bucket list . He explained that the stress of the diagnosis had led him to rely on the pills. 'I realized that my life span is very . short and that's okay, that's acceptable to me,' he said. 'What's not acceptable is . wasting what time I do have on drugs and opiates.' Eggers, from Irvine, California, checked into the Adelante Recovery Center and is now drug free, although he will be prescribed painkillers following his next procedure, KTLA reported. It is just the latest aim he has ticked off his bucket list. He has also traveled to Europe, skydived, met his favorite teen band Depeche Mode and attended the Halloween party at the Playboy Mansion. Other highlights have included attending holiday receptions as the guest of honor at Vice President Joe Biden's mansion and the White House, and an appearance on TV show Major Crimes. Bucket list: He has met Vice President Joe Biden, left, and appeared on the TV show Major Crimes, right . On camera: He has documented his treatment, pictured, and his adventures since the diagnosis . Struggle: Eggers, who was diagnosed with the aggressive cancer last year, becomes emotional in hospital . He planned the impressive list when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma stage 4 in January 2013. He had just returned home from the gym when he started losing feeling in his limbs and could not speak. He suffered a seizure and when he awoke hours later, he called 911, the OC Register reported. Doctors discovered a massive tumor along the right side of his skull and he underwent brain surgery, leaving him with a large scar along the side of his head and his face partially paralyzed. His doctors gave him just 12 to 15 months to live, so he decided to really begin living life, raising funds for other cancer sufferers and working pro bono for families who need help standing up to their health insurance companies on behalf of their sick children. New life: Eggers, who is married, had his own law practice for 15 years before the diagnosis, left, but said until the diagnosis he thought of himself before others. He is pictured with his family, right . Before the diagnosis, 'I spent a lot of time thinking about . myself and - I'm not proud to say this – not much thinking about other . people,' he said. 'Now, I want to leave this place better than I . found it.' He said that his latest feat - kicking the painkillers - will now truly allow him to live.

"By . Tammy Hughes . Students at the University of Buckingham may not have noticed Bertie Gladwin all that much while he was studying for a masters degree in military intelligence. He wasn't there at freshers' week and he probably didn't indulge in many raucous nights out or beer-fueled bar crawls. But nevertheless Britain's oldest student has proved that it's better late than never. Mr Gladwin, who left school at 14 with no interest in academia, has now graduated aged 91 with a distinction in a Masters degree after a career in the secret service. Rather than studying at home, the energetic pensioner packed his bag and headed into lectures and seminars with the rest of the post-grad students, who were all in their early 20s. Britain's oldest graduate Bertie Gladwin is pictured here proudly holding his masters degree in military intelligence . Relaxed: Mr Gladwin is delighted to have received his third degree and is looking forward to spending some time at home with wife Wendy . Like any other student, the Mr Gladwin turned up late for his first lecture and got lost in the maze of corridors at university. The World War Two veteran was also confused by computers, which he had never used before he retied in 1987, and regularly deleted whole essays by mistake. But while he struggled with some aspects of modern learning, the senior student had no problem getting to grips with his degree - after two decades working through the intelligence history he was studying. As a determined youngster Mr Gladwin rose from his first job as a grocery delivery boy to become a radio communications engineer with the Foreign Office and secret service. As soon as he spotted the degree Mr Gladwin - who still sends Morse Code messages to friends across the world - knew it was perfect for him. Impressively, his masters is the third degree he has bagged since retiring 25 years go, after he completing a BA in Psychology and a BSc in Microbiology through the Open University. The graduate, of Milton Keynes, Bucks, admitted today that he was a 'late bloomer' and revealed he was even considering tackling on a PhD. Mr Gladwin said: 'Most of what we handled isn't secret anymore of course, in fact I had to study some of it for my Masters. Mr Gladwin didn't attend freshers' week or any raucous parties - but like many students he was late for his first lecture . 'It was a strange feeling to be reading about history in a textbook that you lived through yourself. 'When I started I was worried about being up to the challenge but once I gotthere I realised I could have been the most qualified person ever to do thatcourse.' He added: 'At the start of the course I have to admit I was a little embarrassed at first, I didn't know what would be expected of me. 'On the first day I couldn't find the class so I was around 20 minutes late and had to creep in the back of the room .

"By . Sara Malm . The Nazis were investigating how to use mosquitos as biological weapons, recently discovered documents reveal. SS-chief Heinrich Himmler’s entomological institute at Dachau concentration camp investigated whether malaria-infected mosquitos could survive transport into enemy territory. The institute, set up by Himmler in 1942, conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to ‘transport’ malaria from the lab to Allied troops. Nazi's bio war: SS-chief Heinrich Himmler's entomological institute at Dachau conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to spread malaria to Allied troops . The institute’s official mission was . to conduct research into insect-transmitted diseases, such as typhoid, . but according to a recent article, it also investigated potential ways . of conducting biological warfare . In . 1944, the director of the institute recommended a particular type of . anopheles mosquito known for its capacity to transmit malaria to humans, . according to an article in science journal Endeavour. Due . to Germany having signed up to the 1925 Geneva protocol, use of . biological weapons was forbidden and as a result, the ‘mosquito malaria . project’ had to remain secret. The . project was ‘a bizarre mix of Himmler's smattering of scientific . knowledge, personal paranoia, an esoteric world view, and genuine . concerns about his SS troops’, the article’s author Klaus Reinhardt told . Süddeutsche Zeitung. The idea of attacking Nazi enemies with malaria was not the only unconventional idea investigated by Himmler. Evil plans: The 'mosquito project' was carried out in secret, by scientists at Himmler's Dachau concentration camp, and proof of the experiments has only emerged in modern times . As Hitler, pictured with Himmler, had signed the 1925 Geneva protocol the 'mosquito malaria project' had to be conducted in secret at Dachau . According to a 2010 book, Himmler believed he would be able to manufacture gold. An alchemist named Karl Malchus convinced Himmler that he could make gold from stones, soil and even paraffin. He . was installed at another secret unit at Dachau, and it allegedly took . several weeks before Himmler realised he had been conned. 'Operation . Munchkin' was another one of the SS chief's plans, one which involved . breeding giant Angora rabbits in concentration camps to provide . fur-lined clothing for Hitler's armed forces. While . prisoners were starved, beaten and tortured to death in Auschwitz, . Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen and Dachau, thousands of rabbits were kept in . hutches in these and 27 other camps. The . rabbits were treated eons better than the prisoners of the camps, and . according to Himmler's notes the population grew from 6,500 in 1941 to . 25,000 in 1943. However, as the Allies began to move in on Nazi Germany, Himmler's 'pet project' was stopped.","Nazi scientists researched how to spread malaria to Allied troops .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Rebecca Camber . Jurors cleared Dave Lee Travis after a question to the judge revealed they were apparently grappling with the difficulties of historical allegations. They offered a glimpse into their thinking when they asked the judge about the ‘lack of supporting evidence and the passage of time’. There was no forensic evidence put forward and in none of the 14 counts was there a corroborating witness to the alleged assaults. As Travis himself told the jury, after the court had heard the women’s claims: ‘It’s their word against mine.’ Cleared: Dave Lee Travis appears outside of Southwark Crown Court yesterday after being found not guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault . The jury comprised eight women and four men – the same male-female split as the jury who cleared Coronation Street star William Roache last week. On the third day of their deliberations, they sent a question to the judge asking what to do if they believed a woman’s testimony but had no additional evidence. The question read: ‘Miss Moore (the prosecutor), in summing up, said if we believe that the complainant was telling the truth, then we must find the defendant guilty. 'Can you give us any guidance on how that should be weighed with the lack of supporting evidence and the passage of time so we are sure beyond reasonable doubt?’ In response, the judge reminded them the prosecutor had said that, if they concluded what the complainant said was accurate and truthful, then they should convict. The jurors went back into their room and continued deliberating for a further day. In the end, they decided to believe Travis’s account. Claims: The accusations had related mainly to Travis's time as a BBC DJ in the 1970s and 1980s . Historic cases: Travis was prosecuted as a result of Operation Yewtree, launched in 2012 after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory peadophile. Travis is pictured here on Top of the Pops with Savile . Yesterday Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted police were caught in a ‘Catch-22’ dilemma when considering historical sexual allegations. He said: ‘I think if a victim comes to us and makes an allegation they deserve a thorough investigation. ‘And we can hardly turn them away. In fact one of the criticisms in [Operation] Yewtree is that in the past 20, 30 years victims have been turned away and not listened to. It seems to me we are caught both ways.’ The jury that cleared Travis of 12 cases of indecent assault was made up of eight women - six of them young - and four men. By coincidence, this was the same gender breakdown as the jury at Preston Crown Court that cleared Coronation Street actor William Roache of historic sex allegations last week. After a four-week trial, during which Travis arrived alone each day to spare his Swedish wife the court ordeal, the jury deliberated for 21 hours and 50 minutes spread over four days. In the Roache case, the jury only retired for six hours. Yewtree was launched in October 2012 after Jimmy Savile, who died aged 84 in 2011, was exposed as a predatory paedophile who abused hundreds of victims. It has already cost £2.7million, of which £490,000 has been paid out in overtime to the 30-strong detective team. The operation has also led to 16 arrests, with four people charged and five suspects remaining on bail. Police also revealed yesterday that further victims had come forward alleging sex abuse by comedian Freddie Starr. Starr, who was first held in November 2012, is taking High Court action after he was bailed again yesterday despite assurances that a charge or release decision would be made. The 71-year-old has been rearrested three times over further claims since he was first held. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said that additional alleged victims coming forward had lengthened the investigation. ‘All of the allegations deserve a thorough investigation. That’s what we do,’ he said. Britain’s most senior prosecutor also faced difficult questions last night over her decision to charge Travis. Relief: Travis, shown in a court sketch expressing his relief at the not guilty verdicts, told the jury: 'It's their word against mine' Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ruled last August there was sufficient evidence to charge the ex-Radio One DJ, real name David Griffin, with 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. A few weeks later, he was charged with two more counts of indecent assault – bringing the total number of charges to 14. Mrs Saunders authorised the charges in her previous job as chief crown prosecutor for London. In a statement announcing the initial charges last year, she made clear she had carefully considered the evidence given by officers on Operation Yewtree. She said: ‘We have also decided no further action should be taken in relation to seven separate allegations against Mr Griffin as we determined there was insufficient evidence.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jurors' thinking was hinted at in written question to judge .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . As her father languishes in the water, this bewildered little cygnet knows only that she should not leave his side. So she paddles determinedly in his wake as he drifts in the canal, a broken shadow of the majestic creature he once was. Then as he curls up in some rushes, slipping in and out of consciousness, the cygnet snuggles on his back, seeking some comfort in the smooth white feathers. The baby swan trails its father, who had to be put down after it is thought it was poisoned with contaminated bread . Elsewhere on the canal, her mother was already close to death, victim of a poisoner thought to have fed both swans contaminated bread. By the time rescuers found the pair it was too late to save them and both had to be put down. Last night their orphaned cygnet was being cared for at a wildlife rescue centre. The RSPCA is investigating the deaths. The drama unfolded in the early evening on Sunday when passers-by noticed the distressed swans on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Church, Lancashire. The birds seemed to be semi-conscious, swooning and drooping in the water. A dog walker alerted the RSPCA and officers arrived at the canal bank. The birds, which have royal protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, were rescued but it was too late to save them. It is feared that they had been fed poisoned food, with reports that contaminated bread was found nearby. The deaths have been branded as ‘despicable’ and ‘beyond belief’ by community leaders. It is feared that food they had been given may have been poisioned, with reports that contaminated bread was found nearby. The cygnet snuggles on her father's back as he rests in the rushes after eating contaminated bread . A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: 'A concerned dog walker called to report two adult swans that looked very lethargic near a canal at Peel Bank, Church. 'With the help of the member of the public, the swans, along with their cygnet, were collected by an RSPCA Animal Welfare Officer and taken to a local vet. ‘Sadly the vet decided the two adult swans had no chance of survival. They were put to sleep, and their cygnet has been transferred to an RSPCA wildlife centre. Neither swan appeared to have any physical injury and one route the RSPCA is investigating is that the swans have been poisoned. 'We are extremely grateful to the walker who flagged this up to us.' A dog walker said he came across the swans at around 5pm on Sunday. He said: 'I was walking my dog and there was a group of people, and I wondered what they were up to. An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Sadly the vet decided the two adult swans had no chance of survival. They were put to sleep, and their cygnet has been transferred to an RSPCA wildlife centre . 'I saw one girl cuddling a swan on the bank, and the other swan was in the water with its young one.' The man called the charity initially believing the birds had been physically attacked. After taking his dog home, he returned with his camera and took pictures of the swans, which he posted on the internet asking for help to find the culprits. He wrote: 'They were still just about living. Kids are looking after the swans the best they can for now. 'Sorry if this is a bit panicky but it’s a crying shame and darn right sick - whoever’s done it. I’m going back there now.' Local councillor Peter Britcliffe, said: 'You really do wonder what sort of despicable person would do this to animals. 'It’s beyond belief and incredible that somebody could get up to something like this. I’m sure everybody will be stunned by this.'","Distressed swans were discovered by a dog walker in Church, Lancashire .

"By . Chris Brooke . Three  family members suspected of murdering a toddler have escaped justice because police can’t prove who was to blame, an inquest heard yesterday. Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was found collapsed in her cot with ‘catastrophic’ head injuries and died in hospital  hours later. Medical experts concluded that the  21-month-old girl received the fatal ‘blunt force trauma’ injuries close to the time at which she was found dying. Tragic: Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in February 2012. But two-and-a-half years later, no one has been charged with her death . Family: The court heard Summer, pictured with mother Victoria Rogers, came from a loving family who had no contact with social services . Her injuries were ‘inflicted by a third party’ and not the result of an accident, the inquest heard. Police . arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, . 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder because all . three spent time being ‘responsible’ for the toddler during the period . when experts said she must have been battered. None of them could offer an explanation for the shocking injuries or recall an accident that could be to blame. But . coroner Oliver Longstaff was told that senior lawyers from the Crown . Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence for a . ‘realistic prospect of a conviction’ and refused to charge any of the . three suspects. Summer was a healthy and happy girl from a ‘loving family’, the Bradford inquest was told. Her parents separated shortly after her birth in May 2010. Miss . Rogers, an ancillary nurse, began a new relationship with Mr Sharp, a . tyre garage manager, in October that year and  they were living together . at  the time of Summer’s death in  February 2012. Detective . Constable Richard Peckett of West Yorkshire Police said there was ‘no . history of  violence or abusive behaviour in the family and no social . services involvement’. Mystery: Summer's mother Victoria Rogers (right) was arrested on suspicion of murder after medical records showed her injuries could not have been inflicted by accident but was later released without charge . Confusion: Her stepfather Craig Sharpe (pictured with Summer) was also arrested and then released because the CPS could not determine who had been looking after the 21-month-old toddler . Summer’s father Joss Ratcliffe, 25, a plumber, was still involved in her care. Police took statements from Summer’s relatives and medical experts compiled a series of reports into the injuries she suffered. The inquest heard Miss Rogers told police she had gone into Summer’s bedroom at 5.30am before leaving for work. The . little girl said ‘bot, bot’ and Miss Rogers gave her a bottle of milk . to drink in her cot. She then left the house in Dewsbury at around 6am, . leaving Mr Sharp in charge. DC Peckett said Miss Rogers’ account was . that there was ‘interaction between Summer and herself’, which indicated . the child was fit and well at that point. Mr Sharp was briefly ‘in the house on his own’ but is not known to have gone into Summer’s bedroom. At 7.40am, grandmother Susan Rogers arrived at the house to take over babysitting duties. Investigation: Details of the incident that led to Summer's death are now emerging in a five-day inquest in Bradford, which her mother (pictured right with Summer) and other family members are attending . The . inquest was told Summer was ‘checked on’ 10 minutes later in her bed . and it wasn’t until 8.30am that Mrs Rogers realised something was wrong. The . retired nurse found Summer was ‘not breathing and her head was floppy’. She immediately started CPR and phoned relatives for help. When . paramedics arrived at the house at 8.54am, Summer was not breathing but . had a pulse. She was rushed to hospital but died early the next day. Forensic . pathologist Dr Mathew Lyall, who carried out a post mortem, said Summer . suffered bleeding and swelling on the brain, and had bruises on  her . scalp – the classic ‘triad’  of injuries ‘strongly associated with . non-accidental infantile head injuries’. Dr . Lyall said the fatal head injury was ‘caused by a third party’ and was . not the result of a trivial impact. The pathologist said he didn’t know . if Summer had been struck with an object or against a wall. And the number of injuries to the head indicated ‘more than one application of force’ to Summer’s scalp, he said. DC . Peckett said a file was sent to the CPS but no one would be charged . with any offence in relation to Summer’s death unless fresh evidence . came to light. He agreed . with the coroner’s suggestion that the ‘sticking point’ preventing a . prosecution was establishing how the fatal injury had been caused and . ‘who was responsible’. Summer’s parents and other relatives are due to give evidence later in the week. The hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe died of a blunt force injury to the head in 2012 .

"By . Sarah Harris . Education Secretary Michael today launches a consultation on new content for GCSE and A-level exams . Teenagers should learn about the ‘real world’ in school including maths lessons in mortality and health statistics. Under plans to toughen up qualifications, the government said children should write their own programs in computer science GCSE and learn about the culture and ‘sociological issues’ of a country in language A-levels. The move is designed to help students better compete for apprenticeships, university places and jobs in the global labour market. The government is reforming A-levels following concerns from academics that current qualifications are not adequately preparing students for degree level courses. GCSEs are also being revamped to make them more rigorous than previous specifications, placing them on a par with education systems across the world. Education Secretary Michael Gove will today launch consultations on new content for A and AS-levels in maths, further maths, geography, ancient languages, modern foreign languages, PE, music and dance. There is a new emphasis on problem solving in maths A-levels. For the first time, students must interpret at least one real, large data set for example mortality and health statistics for countries across the world. In geography A-level, there will be a ‘better balance between physical and human geography’ and a focus on fieldwork. Students will be required to study global systems and governance, landscape systems as well as water and carbon cycling. This follows feedback from universities that students often arrive without any ‘substantive’ experience of independent research and fieldwork. In modern foreign language A-levels, sixth-formers will be expected to ‘use language spontaneously’ in discussions. They must learn about the ‘literature, culture and sociological issues in the countries where the language of study is spoken’, according to the Department for Education. There was no requirement to learn about the society of a country under the previous specification. In PE, students will have to demonstrate their ability to use modelling and data analysis to evaluate physical activity. The move, which will see students learn about the 'real world' in their . subjects, is designed to help students better compete for . apprenticeships, university places and jobs in general (stock pic) Academics have complained that current A-level PE students have little experience of critical thinking, data analysis or research. Mr Gove will also today publish proposed new content for GCSEs in art and design, dance, computer science, music and PE. Computer science GCSEs will require teenagers to analyse and solve problems, write and refine programmes and understand key mathematical principles. They must also learn about data representation and Boolean logic, a form of algebra in which all values are reduced to either ‘true’ or ‘false’. These minimum requirements were developed with advice from organisations including the British Computer Society, E-Skills UK, Naace and the Royal Society of Engineers. Music GCSE will also become more demanding, with teenagers facing new minimum requirements for the length of time they must spend performing and composing. PE has more ‘theoretical and scientific content’, requiring students to understand how anatomy and physiology, psychology and socio-cultural influences impact performance. Dance GCSE students must understand the context of choreography and performance and pupils will have to better grasp the use of colour, line, tone and texture in art and design GCSEs. All the subjects being consulted on will be taught in schools from 2016. Charlie Stripp, chief executive of maths in education and industry, welcomed the greater stress on problem solving and modelling in maths A-levels. He said: ‘This, along with the innovative approach to statistics involving the use of technology to analyse large sets of real data, can deepen students’ understanding of mathematics and how it is used.’ The Cultural Learning Alliance, a group of organisations working across the arts, cultural and educational sectors, said new content for arts subjects would help pupils develop critical thinking and ‘hone technical skills’. 'Coupled with real world, fit for purpose assessment it will provide a new foundation for developing demanding and inspiring GCSEs and A-levels that meet pupil and employer needs,’ a spokesman said. A Department for Education spokesman added: ‘These rigorous new exams will equip our children with the best skills and education so they can fulfil their ambitions and succeed in a global workforce.’","Education Secretary launching consultation on new GCSE and A-level exams .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Jenson Button does not believe Mercedes can hide or manipulate the volatile relationship between their two drivers, Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. Button, who partnered Hamilton for three years at McLaren said: 'The drivers need to sort it between themselves. We're all grown ups. It's down to you to solve it, not for the team to cover your issues. If they do that it looks too obvious.' Hamilton was angered by Rosberg's last qualifying lap in Monaco a fortnight ago, believing the German veered off the road deliberately. All smiles: Lewis Hamilton and his former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button share a joke during Thursday's pre-race press conference ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix . Side-by-side: Nico Rosberg appeared alongside his rival during a signing session in Montreal on Thursday . Despite Hamilton stated at the end of the race that they were not friends, he published a tweet a few days later saying they had made up. Whether Mercedes and/or Hamilton's manager had a hand in this public rapprochement is unclear. But, speaking in Montreal yesterday ahead of Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix, Hamilton maintained the sentiment was genuine.  'I said it in the message,' he said. 'We spoke after the race. Like other friends, we have our ups and downs. We've known each other for a long, long time. It's done and dusted and we look forward to working together to help this team win the constructors' championship. Support: Hamilton fans turned out in force for the British driver on Thursday . 'Nico and I spoke to each other and then we individually spoke to the team. Nothing has really changed. The team have done a great job in supporting us. Their support for both of us has been great. We are now full steam ahead.' Rosberg and Hamilton dined together, albeit in a big group, at The Keg Steakhouse and Bar in the city's old town district on Wednesday night. 'Things have never been better,' said Hamilton. 'We're going from strength to strength. People have ups and downs and it's no different to any other experience me and Nico have had in our years racing together. We move on. 'We're pushing forward. There's a long way to go in the season so I'm looking forward to that battle.' In black and white: Nico Rosberg celebrates his win in Monaco a fortnight ago - he leads the championship . Rosberg, who looked relaxed as he conducted his media briefings in the paddock a couple of tables away from Hamilton, said: 'I am quite neutral about my relationship with Lewis. It is always going to be the case that you have some difficult times which will be followed by good times. 'Our strength is that we always talk about what has happened and go through things as we did when we were both 14. It is always going to be like that, and indeed it continues to be like that. 'I don't want to go into that detail of what was said, but be sure that when there are difficult moments we discuss them and move on, so there is nothing out of the ordinary in any way.' Hamilton is favourite to win the Canadian Grand Prix and retake the championship lead from four behinds behind Rosberg. This track is perhaps the one on which he strongest. He won here in 2007 – his first Formula One victory – 2010 and 2012.","Button has called on the Mercedes rivals to 'sort it between themselves'

"By . Sean Poulter . Error: The Money Shop's parent company Dollar Financial accidentally gave more than 6,000 customers loans they couldn't afford due to a systems glitch . Britain's second biggest payday loan giant has agreed to refund more than £700,000 to customers after admitting it gave out loans that people could not afford. Dollar Financial, which was trading as The Money Shop, will refund interest on the loans, plus any default charges imposed because customers missed repayments. However, there will be no further compensation, while the finance giant, which is responsible for one in four payday loans, will not face any fines. Details were announced by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which said Dollar has also promised to order an independent review of the way it lends money. The problems occurred because of a computer ‘systems error’ and relate to loans to some 6,247 customers which were made between January 2013 and April this year. The StepChange Debt Charity welcomed the FCA announcement, but warned rogue payday loan firms have failed to deliver on promises to treat customers fairly. The charity’s head of policy, Peter Tutton, said: ‘Despite the payday lending industry’s repeated assurances that it was lending responsibly and that poor practice was a thing of the past, we have continued to see thousands of cases where people have been trapped in unsustainable and unaffordable cycles of high-cost borrowing, as loans are rolled over and borrowers take on multiple debts. ‘Today’s announcement is further evidence that payday loan companies have failed to act in the best interests of borrowers.’ The news raises new questions about the failure of payday loan giants, which impose sky-high interest rates backed up with punishing penalty fees, to offer fair treatment to customers. The biggest operator, Wonga, was recently ordered to pay more than £2.6million to 45,000 customers who were sent bullying letters from fictitious law firms after falling behind on repayments. The company invented the legal and debt recovery firms to turn the screw on customers by giving the impression their cases had been passed to third party organisations. The FCA said the reason that Dollar Financial is not facing any sanction is because the company broke its own internal rules designed to ensure loans are affordable, rather than any City regulations. A computer software problem meant that staff at The Money Shop agreed higher level loans than the firm’s own guidelines said were acceptable based on the individual’s income. Warning: The Financial Conduct Authority warned rogue loan firms have failed to treat customers fairly . Director of supervision at the FCA, Clive Adamson, said: ‘The FCA expects all credit providers to carry out proper checks to ensure that borrowers don’t take on more than they can afford to pay back. ‘We are pleased that Dollar is working with us to put matters right for its customers and to ensure that these practices are a thing of the past.’ Dollar will contact all the affected customers and expects to provide refunds in cash totalling £79,000, with the remaining customers seeing their outstanding balance reduced. The refunds of interest will only relate to that part of the loan that was above what should have been allowed under the firm’s own lending criteria. Separately, Dollar has committed to improving its approach to assessing affordability and agreed to appoint an independent ‘Skilled Person’ to review its lending decisions. The review will consider whether customers are being treated fairly and are now only being lent sums that they can afford to repay. The problems at Dollar relate to its brand The Money Shop. The firm also operates in the UK under the trading names Payday UK, Payday Express and Ladder Loans. Payday loans offered by The Money Shop have a typical APR interest rate of approaching 3,000per cent. The firm also has more than 500 high street outlets offering pawnbroking, cheque cashing, foreign currency, gold-buying services, pre-loaded holiday and cash debit cards and money transfers. Dollar Financial, based in Nottingham, is part of DFC Global Corp, which was founded in Pennsylvania in the USA in 1979 and now operates across the USA, Canada, Ireland and Continental Europe. Struggling: The ombudsman is concerned that many struggle to repay loans but feel powerless to complain . Money Shop managing director, Sanjiv Corepal, said: ‘The Money Shop is a business which prides itself on the trust enjoyed between customer and company.  Mistakes do happen and, when they do, we can be trusted to put them right, as we have in this instance.’ The FCA is about to announce new controls on the industry that will effectively cap the interest and charges the firms can apply. The decision, which could come later this week, is expected to fix the cap at around £30 for every £100 borrowed. Payday lenders are desperate to rehabilitate their image. Wonga yesterday announced the appointment of a new chairman, who promised to review and clean up its loans business. Andy Haste, the former chief executive of insurer RSA, said there will be a review of the customer base and products to ensure that the group is lending only to ‘customers who can reasonably afford to repay their loans’. The firm said it will also change its marketing to reduce the risk of inadvertently attracting the very young or vulnerable.","Dollar Financial will refund interest on loans plus any default charges .

"By . Daniel Martin . Rising star: Esther McVey, a former presenter on GMTV and Children¿s BBC, looks set to take a seat at the Cabinet table . Esther McVey was invited through the door of 10 Downing Street last night amid speculation she will be one of the biggest winners in David Cameron’s reshuffle. The employment minister, who is a former presenter on GMTV and Children’s BBC, looks set to take a seat at the Cabinet table as the Prime Minister tries to squash claims he has a ‘problem’ with women. Mr Cameron will today promote a string of female junior ministers, while backbenchers will get a step up to government for the first time. His aim is clear: to rid the Tory side of the Government of the image that it is in some way ‘anti women’. Miss McVey, the MP for Wirral West in her native Merseyside, impressed Conservative chiefs with fluent TV appearances to defend the Government’s welfare reform record. There was speculation last night that the 46-year-old could be given the Minister  without Portfolio role vacated by Kenneth Clarke – with a Cabinet seat and wide-ranging remit to go around TV studios speaking up for the Coalition. Another possible role is that of Culture Secretary. It means she is being lined up as a key face for the Tories in the run-up to the election. Her success is set to be mirrored by around a dozen women, including schools minister Elizabeth Truss. Miss Truss, who is close to Education Secretary Michael Gove, is seen by some as a future leadership contender thanks to her attention to detail and unflappable manner. Observers have pointed out that Margaret Thatcher got to the top of the party after a stint at education. The comprehensive school-educated Oxford graduate, a married mother of two, used to work for Shell and Cable & Wireless. Other possible promotions include Nicky Morgan, financial secretary to the Treasury and women’s minister. A protege of George Osborne, she can already attend Cabinet but is not a full member. Nicky Morgan (left), financial secretary to the Treasury and women's minister, could get promoted and schools minister Elizabeth Truss (right) is seen by some as a future leadership contender . Penny Mordaunt, an aide at the Ministry of Defence, could also get a step up. She appeared on the ITV diving reality show Splash! to raise money for charity, and is a sub-lieutenant in the naval reserve. Darling of the right, Priti Patel, is another name being spoken of as a new minister. The  backbench MP for Witham is a member of the Prime Minister’s policy unit at Number 10. Her parents are Ugandan immigrants of Indian origin who came to the UK in the 1970s. Since her election in 2010 she has taken a tough line on crime. Margot James, Amber Rudd, Claire Perry, Harriett Baldwin and Nicola Blackwood could also see themselves advance, and there is speculation defence minister Anna Soubry could do well. Miss Soubry represents the party often on Question Time and has been tipped as a future Defence Secretary.","Esther McVey, Elizabeth Truss and Nicky Morgan likely to take senior roles .

"By . Freya Noble And Aap . Asking radio shock jock Ray Hadley about his private life live on air is a surefire way to abruptly end an interview, Karl Stefanovic discovered on Tuesday morning. The Today Show host asked radio presenter Hadley if he was 'seeing anyone' in a planned interview shortly before 7am this morning. After accusing Stefanovic of 'perpetuating myths' Hadley pulled out his earpiece and got up to walk off the set. The cameras then cut back to Stefanovic. Scroll down for video . 2GB radio host Ray Hadley ended an interview with Karl Stefanovic on the Today show on Tuesday morning after the host quizzed him about his love life . The tantrum appeared to be in some good humor but Hadley branded Stefanovic a 'complete idiot' The interview was already tense, after Hadley took a swipe at the program asking if a segment on the plans of Mosman Council to allow parking police to fine speeding driver was really news. Later when discussing rules for the use of drones in Darwin, Hadley called Stefanovic 'irresponsible' for allowing his children to play with one. But it was the point when Stefanovic asked about Hadley's personal life that really tipped the balance. 'Any private conversation we may have, you can't keep to yourself,' Hadley told Stefanovic, somewhat jokingly. 'There was a report last week that I was dating Delta Goodrem's mum.' To which Stefanovic replied 'I heard you two were on.' 'I've never been to breakfast with her. Stop trying to perpetuate myths that have no basis in truth,' Hadley hit back. He also told Stefanovic that he ran into Delta's mum in the dry cleaners where they were both separately dropping off clothes, and the pair were housemates over 30 years ago. The host barely managed to control his laughter as Hadley flew off the handle about accusations he was dating Delta Goodrem's mum . Hadley accused Stefanovic of not being able to keep private conversations to himself . Hadley then took his earpiece out and microphone off, called Stefanovic a complete idiot, although the whole exchange appeared to be in good humour. The Today host couldn't contain his laughter as he dubbed Hadley's reaction a 'Clive Palmer style walkout.' Hadley split from his wife Suzanne in 2011 and hit out media after their split came under scrutiny earlier this year . Hadley and his wife Suzanne were married for 20 years when they announced their separation in 2011. In February this year the couple asked for privacy after Suzanne applied for and then withdrew AVOs against Hadley and his son, Daniel. Then in May, Hadley lashed out at rival media outlets accusing them of meddling in his life after there was coverage of the radio host's split from his wife. This came after NSW State of Origin assistant coach Matt Parish denied having an affair with Suzanne Hadley, who he says he met only after she separated from the broadcaster. Hadley used his own radio show to address the issue, which played out earlier in the year after accusations he tried to have a football coach sacked because of his relationship with Hadley's estranged wife. 'Now you keep meddling in people's lives, maybe one day I'll start to meddle in your private life,' Hadley said on his show in mid-May in a broadcast directed at Sydney media. On the same day John Singelton, owner of 2GB, made a rare appearance on air during Hadley's show defending the shock jock and making light of the media coverage. Just days earlier Hadley had spoken out about his split from wife Suzanne for the first time, describing it as his 'biggest personal challenge'. Earlier this year Hadley accused those covering stories of his ex-wife's alleged affair with NSW State of Origin assistant coach as 'meddling' in his life . 'I've never been one to be overwhelmed by things, but this year has provided me with no doubt my biggest personal challenge,' Mr Hadley said. 'At times I've felt like staying in bed and not coming here [to work]. 'Listeners have to understand that despite the fact I'm on the wireless I face exactly the same problems off air as you do every day.' Hadley, who leads rugby league talkback show Continuous Call Team, used his 9am to midday slot on 2GB radio station to discuss the Blues, Daley and Trodden three in that same week.","Radio host Ray Hadley abruptly ended an interview on Tuesday morning .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . There were no standing ovations yesterday or headline mentions on the prime-time news for Steve Darcis. Instead it was the largely anonymous grind on the unforgiving proving grounds of the Wimbledon qualifying event at Roehampton — a world far removed from the limelight he enjoyed 12 months ago. As he battled away in the  second preliminary round against Germany’s Daniel Brands — finally losing 3-6,  7-5, 6-2 at 8.15pm in front  of barely a dozen spectators — the scene could hardly have  contrasted more sharply with the first round proper last year, when he sensationally beat world No 1 Rafael Nadal in straight sets on Court No 1. Limelight: Steve Darcis defeated Rafael Nadal in the first round of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships . The Curse? Steve Darcis has suffered a miserable nine months since beating Rafael Nadal at SW19 . After beating Nadal we quickly came to know that he was nicknamed ‘Shark’ (because of a tattoo on his shoulder),  the  experience providing him with the biggest high of his career. That turned out to be the  precursor to a miserable nine months. In fact, you could say that Darcis is just one victim of what might be termed the Curse of Wimbledon 2013. How else to describe the  subsequent woes of so many who made a splash at what was a dramatic Championships? Men’s champion Andy Murray, semi-finalists Juan Martin Del Potro and Jerzy Janowicz, Roger Federer’s  conqueror Sergiy Stakhovsky, women’s finalist Sabine Lisicki, standout home performer Laura Robson — not much has gone right for any of them since. For Darcis, a genial 30-year-old from Liege, the fall has been steeper than most and was more immediate, for he did not even get to play in the next round after dumping out Nadal — who had come into the tournament having swept all before him for months. Darcis’s  problems have been with his shoulder and he barely had time to take in the scale of his achievement against Nadal before starting to fear the worst. Grass roots: After winning Wimbledon, Andy Murray has undergone back surgery and hasn't won a title since . ‘I was staying in a house in Wimbledon Village and I went out to an Italian restaurant with a party of about 10 other Belgian players and coaches that evening,’ he recalled. ‘A lot of people recognised me in there, which was great because it does not happen so much, but inside I knew already that my shoulder was really bad and I couldn’t sleep. I had to say everything was fine in public, but I was ready to pull out.’ He duly did so, and after a period of rest followed by further attempts at playing, he succumbed to what had been looking inevitable: surgery on his right shoulder. When it took place, on October 10, they found a tear in a tendon almost a centimetre long. In fact, it was fairly miraculous he had soldiered on for so long. The news left Darcis worried for his future in the game, let alone when he might come back. Under the knife: Laura Robson reached the fourth round last year but is set to miss the rest of the season after surgery on her wrist . ‘Beating Rafa was the biggest win but it was the start of the worst period of my career, it has been very tough,’ he revealed. ‘I wasn’t confident about being able to come back at all after the surgery, I am just glad to be back here and am grateful they gave me the wildcard into qualifying. ‘I am as physically fit as I have ever been because for  five months I did nothing but physical work, it was very frustrating. I started practising again in early April.’ He came into Wimbledon qualifying having played only one professional tournament, a tiny Futures-level event in Belgium where he managed to reach the final. Downward spiral: Sabine Lisicki has not won two consecutive matches this year after reaching last year's final . It is evident that he still  cannot serve with his old potency, but he is grateful for small mercies. ‘After what the surgeon said when he saw what was wrong with my shoulder, there was a doubt I would play again, so I can only be happy with being back here at all,’ he said. During the dark winter months, he broadly resisted the temptation to wallow in  nostalgia and re-watch his great match against Nadal. Andy Murray (champion) Needed a back operation and has not won a title since.Jerzy Janowicz (semi-finalist) Lost eight straight matches from February to May, slipped to 24th in the rankings.Juan Martin Del Potro (semi-finalist)  Had left wrist surgery in March, out at least until September.Sergiy Stakhovsky (beat Roger Federer) Still only 89th in the rankings, has railed against upheavals in his beloved Ukraine.Sabine Lisicki (finalist) Has not won more than two consecutive matches this year, faces huge drop from ranking of 19th.Laura Robson (fourth round) Had wrist surgery after Australia and will miss most of the season. With the grass relatively lush and fresh that day, the two-time champion simply could not get sufficient purchase on his groundstrokes and the flair of Darcis completely deflated him by the end. ‘I did watch the match one time, just after the operation,’ said Darcis. ‘My main memory is that I tried to keep going for it even when I was nervous. I had to attack because you can’t stick on the baseline against Rafa. Grass isn't greener: Steve Darcis was told he may never play tennis again after surgery on his shoulder . ‘Mentally it is very tough  against him because there is always the fear that he is going to come back. ‘When I won the first set I thought, “If I lose in four I’ve still played a good match”. And when I won the second I thought, “If I lose in five I have still made it a good match”. ‘Even when I went out to serve for the match at 5-4 in the third there were thoughts that if I don’t win this set he might beat me. It was only when I got to  40-15 in that game that I thought, “I’m going to do this”’.’ As with several others who made their name at Wimbledon 2013, Darcis has found there have been great challenges since.","Several players who shone at Wimbledon 2013 have seen fortunes fade .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A rural sports event which is 300 years older than the modern Olympic Games took place in Gloucestershire, with the highlight of the festival shin kicking. The Cotswold Olimpicks, which were first held in 1612 near Chipping Campden, took place for the 402nd time yesterday featuring a range of medieval sports. The top attraction of shin kicking has been taking place at the Games since they began and sees the competitors use straw as shin guards as they try to bring their opponents to the ground. Other sports at the event include tug of war, throwing the hammer and a five mile race as well as a Champion of the Hill tournament, a four event sport which includes a static jump, a hammer throw, throwing a shot put and spurning the barre, an English version of tossing the caber. The Games have been held every year since 1966 after they were revived in 1951, and attract thousands of visitors.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Chinese zoo keepers managed to save the life of a mentally disturbed man after he announced he wanted to improve the lives of caged tigers at a local zoo by offering them his own body to eat. Yang Jinhai, 27, had posted several online messages about how optimistic he was about starting a new life after getting a job as a security guard in Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan province. But he quickly found the job boring and monotonous and moved instead to a job in a printing factory where he also then resigned, saying that he felt there was more to life.

After going to the local zoo he wrote . how depressing it was to see the ‘noble and magnificent tigers’ living . in such humble surroundings, where they were caged and unable to follow . their natural instincts to hunt and kill. He then announced that he had decided to sacrifice himself in order to provide the Bengal tigers with support. Eyewitness .

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Alexandra Klausner . and Associated Press . Dennis Rodman has named his eclectic team of former NBA players and reality show stars that will play in North Korea next week for dictator Kim Jong Un's birthday. Rodman will lead the team that includes former NBA All-Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson, and Vin Baker. Craig Hodges, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith are on the team, as well. They will play against a top North Korean senior national team on Wednesday, marking Kim Jong Un's birthday. Controversial: The former NBA player has released a team sheet to fly to Pyongyang after weeks of talks . The American player's rich histories go beyond basketball, reports Buzz Feed. Kenny Anderson was recently in a play entitled, The Penis Monologues and has appeared on the reality television show, Basketball Wives. Cliff Robinson was on the Real Housewives of New Jersey and may be a participant in the reality show Survivor next year. Vin Baker is a former NBA player who drank his way out of playing basketball and is now apparently enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in New York. Craig Hodges once unsuccessfully sued the NBA in 1996 after he claimed the league discriminated against him due to his political outspokenness and his association with Islamist Louis Farrakhan. Doug Christie and his wife Jackie were recently featured on their own television series called The Christies Committed on BET J. Jackie also appears on Basketball Wives: LA. Buzz Feed reports that Christie is known for not wanting to make eye contact with women other than his wife. Whether or not he's willing to make eye contact with infamous world leaders is a different question all together. Charles D. Smith ran a digital media company, was a motivational speaker, and started an assistance program to help retired players find new careers--the chance of him finding players this gig is unlikely. Los Angeles Clippers' Doug Christie (left in blue) will play alongside former NBA All-Star Vin Baker, of the Minnesota Timberwolves (right in white). The match on January 8 will celebrate Kim Jong Un's birthday . New York Knicks' Charles Smith (right) is another high-profile name in the team, as is All-Star Kenny Anderson . Dennis Rodman, famed for his . unique and controversial relationship with the communist leader Kim Jong Un, flew to . the state last month to help recruit their national team. At the time, he confessed he was struggling to persuade any of his former teammates to make the trip to Pyongyang. Rodman, 52, is the highest profile American to meet with Kim Jong Un since Kim Jong Il passed away in 2011. Rodman . made his latest visit to North Korea shortly before Christmas to train . the North Korean basketball team, though he did not meet with Kim. Rodman, known as much for his piercings, tattoos and bad behavior as he . was for basketball, traveled to the secretive state for the first time . last February with the Harlem Globetrotters for an HBO series produced . by New York-based VICE television. Rodman has called Kim a 'friend for . life.' He claims the game on Wednesday will be an attempt at 'basketball diplomacy'. 'My previous travels have allowed me to feel the enthusiasm and warmth of fans,' Rodman said. 'The positive memories and smiles on the faces of the children and families are a testament to the great efforts we have put into fulfilling our mission wherever we go voiding any politics. We are all looking forward to arriving in Pyongyang, meeting the citizens, visiting various charities and using the opportunity to develop new relationships that result in our annual return,' he continued. Rodman, the most high profile to meet Kim Jong Un since Kim Jong Il died, is here selecting the North Korean team last month. Holding a cigar and wearing a pink shirt, he told the players the game would be an 'honour' Speaking after the North Korean team's tryouts, Rodman discussed his teammates concerns. He . said: 'You know, they're still afraid to come here, but I'm just . telling them, you know, don't be afraid man, it's all love, it's all . love here. 'I understand . what's going on with the political stuff, and I say, I don't go into . that venture, I'm just doing one thing for these kids here, and for this . country, and for my country, and for the world pretty much.' Addressing . the North Korean players, he said: 'I want you guys to do one thing for . your leader. It's his birthday. It's a very special, special day for . the country.' It is less than a month since Kim's uncle was dragged from office and executed, but Rodman has refused to comment on the issue, or on the detention of American Kenneth Bae for allegedly committing anti-state crimes. Instead his focus has been on sport and the basketball game which he hopes will be without political or nationalistic undertones. North Korea will play against America in the first half, but for the second half the teams will be mixed. On Christmas Eve, Paddy Power announced it would not be sponsoring the tournament as a result of their boycott of Pyongyang. Rodman has been criticized for not talking about North Korea's human rights record, described as one of the world's worst by activists, the U.S. State Department and North Korean defectors. The defectors have repeatedly testified about the government's alleged use of indiscriminate killings, rapes, beatings and prison camps holding as many as 120,000 people deemed opponents of authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un, the third generation of his family to rule.","Former NBA players Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, and Charles D.

"By . Jason Groves . Thousands of celebrities, sports stars and wealthy professionals will be warned today that they face massive bills following a clampdown on tax avoidance schemes. HM Revenue and Customs  is publishing a list of 1,200 avoidance schemes whose members will be told to pay up within 90 days. HMRC will identify the schemes only by their serial numbers. However, its list is understood to include the Liberty scheme, reportedly used by a string of high-profile figures including George Michael, Sir Michael Caine and Katie Melua. Take That: Gary Barlow (left), Howard Donald, Jason Orange and Mark Owen. Barlow, Owen, Donald and their manager Jonathan Wild are reported to have invested some £26million in schemes . The scheme’s 1,600 members are also believed to include business tycoons, lawyers, doctors and other wealthy individuals. It was wound up in 2009 when a tax loophole was closed, but a test case relating to members’ tax avoidance is not due to be heard until next year. HMRC’s clampdown is also thought to cover the so-called Icebreaker schemes in which Take That’s Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald and manager Jonathan Wild are reported to have invested some £26million. The taxman believes more than 33,000 individuals and 10,000 companies are members of the schemes being published today. Between them they owe an estimated £4.9billion – equal to an average of about £114,000 each, although some are thought to owe millions of pounds in tax. Katie Melua is reportedly part of the Liberty scheme . Members of the schemes will not face criminal charges, but letters will demand they make ‘accelerated payments’. Experts warn that this could force some into bankruptcy. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke last night welcomed the move, saying the rich should be subject to the same tax laws as everyone else. He said members of the public would have little sympathy for wealthy individuals who had tried to avoid paying their fair share. ‘It is quite right that the Revenue is taking the battle to people who are using their wealth to game our tax system,’ Mr Elphicke said. ‘The behaviour of these people means that hard-working families who do the right thing and pay their taxes have to pay more to support the services we all use. ‘Most people entering these schemes know they are unfair and wrong – they enter these schemes with their eyes wide open. ‘They are taking a gamble on not being caught. What they are doing is unacceptable and wrong.’ The Treasury declined to comment in detail on the individual schemes targeted in the clampdown. Using the schemes is not illegal, and many of the members involved say they already pay large sums in tax and have done nothing wrong. However, failure to make payments demanded by HMRC today could result in criminal charges. HMRC’s decision to publish the list of schemes follows an announcement in the Budget of new rules to make it easier for the taxman to close avoidance schemes. Accountancy firms are now required by law to reveal details of schemes that may be viewed as tax -avoidance arrangements. And instead of pursuing each case through the courts for years, HMRC may now issue demands for immediate payment. David Elliott, a partner at accountants Moore Stephens, said today’s letters were likely to place some individuals in severe difficulty. He told Accountancy Age: ‘Receiving a demand to make up-front payment of tax could put some taxpayers under financial strain, and in the very worst cases, could even trigger personal bankruptcies or business insolvencies before the technical merits of the arrangement have been tested. ‘Even a remote prospect of being made bankrupt could mean that taxpayers feel under pressure to settle disputed cases rather than take an appeal to the courts.’","HMRC will identify the schemes only by their serial numbers .

"By . Rajvir Rai . Follow @@R_Rai . Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Unsurprisingly, World Cup fever dominates the front pages of Tuesday's papers. In France, L'Equipe lead with a picture of Neymar celebrating scoring for Brazil in their 4-1 win over Cameroon on Monday evening with the headline 'The Lone Star'. The main man: French paper L'Equipe and Spain's Mundo Deportivo hail Brazil striker Neymar . Neymar's brace secured top spot in Group A for Brazil and sets up a last-16 showdown with South American rivals Chile. Neymar is also now the World Cup's leading scorer with four goals. In Spain, Mundo Deportivo also pay tribute to Neymar, saying the striker shone and inspired Brazil to glory. Spain ended their terrible World Cup campaign with a 3-0 win over Australia and that also makes Mundo's front page with a big goodbye headline. The paper say 'Iniesta leads the goal fest as La Roja say goodbye to Brazil and Villa scores a backheel as his last strike'. The other big story in Spain is Liverpool striker Luis Suarez's apparent move to Barcelona. Mundo say the clubs are negotiating 'complicated deal' that also involves Alexis Sanchez. They claim that at Anfield it is known that Suarez wants to move to the Nou Camp. Elsewhere in Spain, AS boldly declare 'We . will return' as Spain bow out of the World Cup with a 'respectable' win . over Australia. They also say that, according to Bein Sports, Monaco's .

Their pain picture is of Del Bosque hugging Iniesta, who claims 'it was a hug of respect'. Another intriguing story is the news that Zinedine Zidane could be set to start in management with Real president Florentino Perez ready to give him a chance with Castilla - Madrid's reserve team - in the Spanish second division. In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport picture Mario Balotteli and Ciro Immobile and declare that Cesare Prandelli will play the pair upfront together against Uruguay on Tuesday. Italy need a point to qualify from Group D, and Prandelli says his side 'needs character, head and competitiveness' to do so.

"By . David Kent . Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba stressed the need to put the team ahead of his personal ambitions after helping the African nation kick off their World Cup campaign with victory over Japan. Drogba did not start but came on in the second half and helped provide the inspiration for a 2-1 come-from-behind win in Recife. ‘I was disappointed (not to start),’ the 36-year-old Drogba said. ‘But I have to show my respect to those that started.

Unselfish: Former Chelsea striker accepts that the team is more important than his own personal glory . ‘When I went in, I just wanted to help the team to win the match and I did not need this disappointment in order to be motivated. ‘I don’t know how long I played but I knew it was important to give something extra to the team.’ Japan had taken a first-half lead against the run of play through a goal from Keisuke Honda, but within four minutes of Drogba’s introduction in the 62nd minute the Ivory Coast had turned the match on its head to go  2-1 ahead. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony drew the teams level in the 64th minute and then former Arsenal forward Gervinho netted what would prove to be the match-winner just moments later. ‘Japan weren’t very dangerous but we trailed and had to come from behind to win,’ Drogba said.Drogba, playing in his third World Cup, is hoping that Les Elephants can reach the knock-out round of the competition for the first time in the country’s history. How to get ahead: Gervinho and Wilfried Bony scored the goals that gave Ivory Coast victory . The Ivory Coast take on Colombia on Thursday at the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia. Colombia won their Group C game against Greece to go level on three points with Drogba’s team. ‘It is a beautiful victory and we are happy with the result,’ the Galatasaray forward said. ‘We’ve prepared for many weeks for this game and it was important to start the competition on the right foot. This result will be very important especially if we play a good game against Colombia. Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi warned his side not to get carried away. ‘The players are very happy with the victory, but we are far from being qualified,’ said Lamouchi, who admitted that Drogba had changed the game. ‘We only won one match. We have another tough game ahead (on Thursday) against the leaders of the group (Colombia). We will have to prepare.’ Under par: Despite scoring first through Keisuke Honda, Japan played below their best says coach Alberto Zaccheroni . Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni was frustrated by the outcome but emphasised the need to look forward. The Blue Samurai take on Greece on Thursday at the Estadio das Dunas in Natal. ‘We gave Ivory Coast players too much space and didn’t play well defensively or offensively,’ the Italian said . ‘We have two games left and now we have to improve our morale. ‘We have to play better than we did tonight, and if we can do that then we know we’re capable of producing good results. The past is in the past, what’s important is what’s coming next. ‘Normally we know what we have to do, and when we accomplish that our results are fantastic.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Anyone twice caught carrying on a knife will be automatically jailed, under tough new laws passed by MPs tonight. Tory and Labour backbenchers joined forces to see off an attempt by the Lib Dems to block the measure after Nick Clegg claimed it would see gangs forcing innocent victims to carry knives on their behalf. Mr Clegg's veto  meant Conservative ministers were unable to support the proposal. But it was passed after Tory backbench MP Nick De Bois tabled the measure anyway - with the tacit backing of David Cameron. Knife thugs will be automatically jailed the second time they are caught carrying a blade after Labour MPs backed the Tory proposal in the face of Lib Dem opposition . With Labour support the automatic jail rule passed the Commons by 404 votes to 53. Mr De Bois said the automatic jail sentence would send a clear signal to violent criminals. He said: 'Some have argued that sending a signal may not be enough, that potential offenders do not think of the consequences of pocketing a knife. 'Quite simply, in the vast majority of cases, let's face it, to kill someone with a knife you first have to carry a knife, and I believe our courts are dispensing sentences for possession of a knife in thousands of cases that are quite simply treated by offenders as little more than an occupational hazard. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the tough new rules were only introduced because of Labour support . 'With nearly 8,000 last year being fines and cautions, I would suggest that in some cases that fuels knife crime and does nothing to halt knife crime.' Under the proposals, adults would receive a minimum six-month jail term on their second conviction for carrying a knife, while 16-year-olds would be given at least a four-month detaining and training order. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan welcomed the ruling. He said: 'In opposition David Cameron promised that everyone caught carrying a knife would go to jail. 'After four years as Prime Minister and four years of broken promises, it’s not surprising that David Cameron and his ministers failed to support these measures. They have only been passed because of Labour support. 'We must send out a strong message that knife crime is unacceptable. 'Now, someone caught, charged, prosecuted and found guilty of carrying a knife for a second time will almost certainly be sent to prison unless there are particular reasons why they shouldn’t be. 'There will still be judicial discretion, but the message is clear, those who repeatedly commit knife crime face prison. 'We don’t believe this in itself is enough to rid our streets of the scourge of knives, which is why its important work is done with families, schools, colleges and youth clubs to prevent people carrying a knife in the first place.'","Labour MPs back Tory proposal to jail anyone twice caught with a knife .

The front of the Air China Boeing 757 had been pushed in and scratches and scraped paintwork  were clearly visible when it landed. The plane was climbing over China when a large bang was heard from the front of aircraft. Pictures of the Air China jet show the  damage the mysterious mid-air collision caused to its nose cone after . The pilot said the aircraft was struggling to perform and he immediately called air traffic controllers, according to reports. He was then allowed him to return to the airport. Experts said investigations into the suspected crash have raised suspicions that the aircraft was hit by a 'foreign object'. However, they do not believe it was caused by a bird strike as no blood or feathers were visible on the dented nose cone. The damage was only spotted when the plane, which was travelling from Chengdu to Guangzhou, safely landed. The dented nose cone has caused speculation online that the aircraft hit a UFO as it flew over China . The pictures have prompted online speculation that it was caused by a UFO or a drone strike. Other theories posted on the Aviation Herald include pressure from rapidly heated and expanded air. Former government UFO investigator Nick Pope told The Sun that an examination of the nose cone should reveal what hit it. He said traces of whatever collided with the aircraft should be visible. However, he questioned whether the 'secretive' Chinese would reveal the cause. Mr Pope told The Sun: 'Cases like this show that whatever people believe about UFOs, there are serious air safety issues here. 'MoD and CAA files contain dozens of reports of near misses between UFOs and commercial aircraft. 'It's only a matter of time before there's a catastrophe.'

Last week, it emerged that three passenger jet pilots saw UFOs . above Britain's Scientology headquarters on their approach to Gatwick . Airport. A report revealed that they each saw 'two flat, silver discs', with some flying within 100ft. Air traffic control then spotted six UFOs on their radars before they suddenly disappeared.

"By . Katy Winter . A mother who spent 200 hours baking an incredible recreation of Marie Antoinette has been rewarded for her efforts after being handed the top prize at the UK's largest baking contest. The towering four-foot creation took six months to make and earned its creator, Amanda MacLeod, critical acclaim from judges at the sugarcraft and cake decorating show. Mother-of-one Amanda spent around two hundred hours completing the complex masterpiece in the likeness of the French Queen, who is widely credited with the immortal line, 'Let them eat cake'. Amanda Macleod spent an unbelievable 200 hours creating the award winning cake version of Mary Antionette . The mother-of-one says that the cake was originally an idea for a wedding cake . The 44-year-old won best in class in the 'decorative exhibit' category at Cake International in London's ExCeL exhibition centre . Actually, historians broadly agree that it was not Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France between 1774 and 1792, who uttered the insensitive words (which actually translate as 'let them eat brioche') when told French peasants were starving and had no bread to eat. Rather, they believe it was the wife of Louis XIV who said the words some 100 years earlier. Still, the popularist version triumphed on the day as the 44-year-old won best in class in the Decorative Exhibit category at Cake International in London's ExCeL exhibition centre. She said: 'I came up with the Marie Antoinette design years ago as an idea for a wedding cake but it never got made.

"By . Rob Cooper . Freedom: Joland Giwa, 24, walking the streets today after being released from prison, said he was a rapper and not a gangster . A 'dangerous' gang leader jailed for robbery who is free to walk the streets because the Government has been unable to deport him claimed today: 'I'm not a gangster - I'm a gangsta rapper'. Jolan Giwa, 24, was the ‘general’ of an 80-strong gang behind a spate of stabbings, shootings and killings. The thug is still in Britain because immigration officials have been unable to determine his nationality and both Nigeria and Sierra Leone have refused to take him. Giwa arrived at Heathrow on a flight from Nigeria in 1999 and claimed asylum after telling officials he was a ten-year-old from Sierra Leone whose parents were killed in its civil war. His . asylum claim was refused but he was given permission to stay for four . years, before being given a permanent right to stay in 2005. After being released from prison, the thug has been moved to a bail hostel . in Newport, South Wales. He claimed today that his infamous street gang Don't Say Nothing are a band of rappers imitating 50 Cent and Tupac - and not hardened criminals. He said: 'It was about making music. We did think we were gangsters because that’s what you think with American hip hop. 'But it was more of a group of friends that would play football together and stuff.' Giwa appeared in YouTube videos where . claimed to be 'the f***ing general' and bragged of 'shanking' his rivals . - street slang for stabbing. Police said Giwa had a 'clear propensity for violence' and posed a 'serious threat to the public'. He . was jailed for 27 months in February 2009 for robbery and theft before . later using a phone smuggled into prison to post a picture of himself . pumping iron in his cell. At the end of his sentence, he was detained at Belmarsh Prison as border chiefs made efforts to deport him. Thug: Joland Giwa, 24, who was jailed for robbery and theft, said his gang were rappers who played football together and not hardened criminals . But those efforts failed, and he eventually had to be released. Father-of-two . Giwa, who has not seen his children since 2007, claims to be a 'family . man' who has put his violent past behind him. He said: 'I’m a changed man - since being in Newport I’ve not had any contact with any gangs. 'This is a great area - it’s only fair I treat this place with respect and give back to Newport. Violent thug: Giwa, 24, was released from prison last year and has been sent to live in a bail hostel in Newport, South Wales . 'I was 17 when I was convicted and those were the last crimes I was involved in. I never think I’m perfect but I think the way I’ve been targeted is worse than a terrorist - I have never killed anyone. 'I’m not a violent person, nobody is scared of me, I’m not a harm to the public.' The Home Office are still attempting to kick Giwa out of Britain. Newport MP Paul Flynn spoke of his 'deep outrage and anger' that Giwa was moved to the bail hostel in the suburban street. He wrote to the Home Office asking why a 'dangerous criminal’ has been ordered to live in Newport. In the letter, Mr Flynn wrote: 'This person presents a problem for London and the rest of England. What was the process that determined that he, and the danger he represents, should be re-located to Wales and Newport? 'What other areas were considered and what consultations were held with Newport representatives? If unpalatable decisions are unavoidable, London should be responsible for its own problems and not seek to dump them on Wales and Newport.' Mr Flynn said he is also sending his letter to the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz MP, urging an investigation.","John Giwa, 24, was general of a gang in Croydon, south London .

The bodies of 87 migrants were found on Wednesday in Niger's desert north after they died of thirst just a few kilometres from the border of Algeria, their planned destination, sources said. The corpses of the seven men, 32 women and 48 children were in addition to five bodies of women and girls found earlier, a security source said. All died in early October after a failed attempt to reach Algeria that began in late September, the source added. Death in the desert: A graphic showing where the bodies of 87 migrants were found in Niger after two vehicles taking them to Algeria broke down before reaching the border . Almoustapha Alhacen, from local aid organisation Aghir In'man, confirmed the death toll and gave a graphic account of discovering the bodies, some of which he said may have been eaten by jackals. 'The corpses were decomposed. it was horrible,' he said. 'We found them in different locations in a 20km (12-mile) radius and in small groups, often under trees, or under the sun. 'Sometimes a mother and children, but some lone children too.' The bodies were buried according to Muslim rites, 'as and when they were found,' added Alhacen. Mr Alhacen said that because so many of . the dead were children or teenagers, it was possible they were heading . for low paid jobs in Algeria. Treacherous: The seven men, 32 women and 48 children died of thirst in early October after walking for days in the Sahara desert (above, file picture) Nigerien officials said on Monday that dozens of migrants, most of them women and children, had died of thirst in the Sahara desert earlier this month. Two vehicles were carrying the migrants when they broke down, one about 83 kilometres (51 miles) from the city of Arlit, northern Niger where they had set off from, and another at 158 kilometres (98 miles), a security source said. 'The first vehicle broke down. The second returned to Arlit to get a spare part after getting all the migrants it was carrying to alight, but it too broke down,' said the source. 'We think that the migrants were in the desert for seven days and on the fifth day, they began to leave the broken down vehicle in search of a well,' said the source. However, 21 people had survived, the source said, including a man who walked to Arlit and a woman who was saved by a driver who came across her in the desert and took her to the same city. - Aid worker . Nineteen others reached the Algerian city of Tamanrasset, but were sent back to Niger, the source added. In the lucrative business of transporting Africans fleeing conditions at home for what they hope will be a better life elsewhere, traffickers quite frequently abandon their human cargo in the desert, leaving them to near certain death. Azaoua Mamane, who works for the non-governmental organisation Synergie in Arlit, said the group left behind consisted of 'entire families, including many children and women, who departed for Algeria, where they hoped to beg for their keep'. Niger is one of the world's poorest countries and has been hit by successive food crises. Libya, rather than Algeria, is more frequently the favoured country of transit for west Africans making the journey across the continent, many of whom aim to travel on to Europe. The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that at least 30,000 economic migrants passed through Agadez, northern Niger's largest city, between March and August of this year. These migrants often look to Europe as their final destination, a security source told AFP, and use Libya as a jumping off point amid the relative chaos in the North African country since the fall of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011. Humanitarian agencies say nearly 20,000 migrants have perished while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe over the past 20 years. The death of more than 300 Africans in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this month has recently pushed the issue to the top of Europe's political agenda.","Seven men, 32 women and 48 children found near the Algerian border .

"By . Daniel Martin . Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles has confirmed that two 'garden cities' could be built in the south east . Eric Pickles has confirmed that two 'garden cities' could be built in the south east in a bid to tackle Britain's housing crisis. The Communities Secretary insisted that they would not be forced on unwilling new communities, and said local councils had already come forward to express an interest. He insisted his department had not been responsible for drawing up a document, which was reported last week as proposing new settlements at Yalding in Kent and Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. Speaking on Sky News's Murnaghan programme, he said no decisions had been made on location. 'Let me be absolutely clear: I have not seen, formally or informally... this report does not come from my department,' he said. 'We tend to be the experts in planning and housing so we would expect some degree of involvement. 'I don't rule out an ambitious civil servant from another department putting something together but both parties stood on a manifesto saying we would not force eco-towns or garden cities on the population.' Mr Pickles said land was being released by the coalition through the local infrastructure plan for housing and that plots for 100,000 homes would be available before the next election. And he added: 'It is important to set up settlements where there is going to be some infrastructure there, where there is going to be roads and the like. I think we could probably produce garden settlements, we could produce a garden city or two - provided it is in places where people want it and there are authorities expressing an interest. Yalding: A draft proposal suggests  new settlements in Yalding, Kent and Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire . 'But it has to be on the basis of consent. After all, Labour promised five garden cities and produced none and when that failed to arrive they promised 10. All that happened with that policy was building resentment, not a single dwelling.' Writing in the Daily Telegraph last week, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'We cannot make the mistakes of past governments and sit on our hands while a whole generation of people are squeezed out of the housing market. It is our duty to change the story. 'We must bring decades of indecision and stagnant political will to an end. 'That is why I am a strong advocate of garden cities, where there is clear local support and private sector appetite. In 2011, our housing strategy committed us to publishing a prospectus for new garden cities and that is exactly what we'll do.'

"By . Daniel Martin . Small victories: Pickles has managed to overturn the European Commission diktat that the flag must be flown for a week in May . Eric Pickles is to snub his nose at Brussels by announcing plans to celebrate Europe Day by flying the EU flag as far away from public view as possible - in a cellar. The Communities Secretary has successfully overturned a European Commission diktat that the 12-star banner must be flown outside the buildings of all government ministries for one week from 9 May. The commission has rewritten its rules to state that the flag must still be displayed - but only somewhere on the premises; not necessarily outside. Mr Pickles has cheekily responded by pledging to unfurl the blue and yellow standard in a spare room in the basement of his Department of Communities and Local Government. And instead of being flown in the normal sense, the EU flag will simply be pinned on a notice board - in a sign of what the Communities minister really thinks of Brussels. The basement room was previously used as a subsidised bar for civil servants called the DETR Darts Bar, opened by his predecessor John Prescott in the late 1990s. Mr Pickles closed the bar as part of cost-cutting measures to bring down the deficit - and it now stands completely empty. There is no need for anyone to visit it. Last night a source at the DCLG said: ‘We have a spare room in the basement of the building thanks to the closure of the “Prezza Arms”, so there is plenty of space for the flag down there. ‘The only Union flag that should be flying is the United Kingdom’s union flag.’ The old EU rules, agreed by Labour in 2006, stated that government departments had to fly the EU flag in front of its premises for one week every year, after Europe Day, on 9 May. Visible failure to comply could have resulted in the European Commission imposing fines. Following pressure from Mr Pickles, the UK Government has fought to renegotiate this requirement. And, on 21 December last year, new watered-down rules came forward. The new rules merely state that departments must ‘display the EU emblem at the premises of each managing authority’. There is requirement to fly the flag outside, and the revised requirements could be met by an internal noticeboard somewhere inside the building. The victory was revealed in the Commons yesterday by Mr Pickles, who said the ‘petty’ European Union regulation agreed by the last Labour administration had now gone following talks led by his department. Pickles rather cheekily said he would display the flag on a noticeboard in the basement of his department . He told MPs this was an example of how the UK could and should claim powers back from Brussels. He said: ‘I would like to make a brief statement about the European Union. The last Labour Government signed up to petty EU laws that forced my and other departments to fly the European Union flag outside our buildings. ‘I can announce today that we have renegotiated this law. Moving forward, this burdensome law to fly the EU flag has gone. This small step shows our nation can and should claim powers back from unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.’ Addressing Speaker John Bercow, Mr Pickles added to laughter from MPs: ‘Could I apologise to you for not flying the flag of Buckingham yesterday to celebrate your birthday. I hope you had a good day.’ Mr Bercow, MP for Buckingham, replied: ‘You are forgiven.’","Overturned European Commission diktat that 12-star banner must be flown outside government buildings for a week in May .

"By . Bill Caven . He has covered most of the major sporting events in all corners of the world. But now Andy Hooper, the Daily Mail’s leading sports photographer, has seen his work receive the official stamp of approval. A special set of souvenir stamps featuring action shots taken by the 52-year-old photographer to celebrate the 2014 Commonwealth Games go on sale today. The action shots featured on the stamps, created to celebrate the 2014 Commonwealth Games, were taken by Daily Mail photographer Andy Hooper . Andy Hooper supplied six pictures to feature on the special set of Commonwealth Games stamps. The photos were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations . Mr Hooper who is based at the Mail’s headquarters in London, spoke of his delight at being given the commission to provide the photographs. He said: ‘I was approached by  the Royal Mail and asked if I could supply six pictures to feature on the special set of stamps. ‘They were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations. ‘When I saw the end result I was naturally delighted and very honoured to be involved in this project.’ The Royal Mail stamps, which feature athletes swimming, cycling, playing tennis, running and playing netball, go on sale today . The only major sticking point in the exercise was disguising the identities of the sportsmen and woman involved in the six different sports recognised on the stamps. The photographer explained: ‘One of the stipulations was that you are not allowed to show any living  person on a stamp, so it went against the grain that the images were not sharp. ‘However, the photographs I supplied obviously were but then the illustrator got to work on them to ensure we worked within the guidelines.’ Andy Hooper, pictured, with his sports photographer of the year award has told of his delight at being given the commission to provide the photographs . Unfortunately the Mail cameraman will not be involved when the spectacle begins next week. He said: ‘Having just returned from the World Cup finals in Brazil, and then, the Open golf tournament, I have family holiday commitments in place. ‘But I will be there in spirit, if nothing else.’","Daily Mail's leading sports photographer sees work given stamp of approval .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Thirty-three pages of text messages between Aaron Hernandez and New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick could be used as evidence in the former NFL player's murder trial. Boston prosecutors have handed the messages over to Hernandez's defence team, according to Bristol County court documents released yesterday. There is no indication what they might say. The documents also revealed that Mr Belichick was interviewed by police last August as detectives investigated the shooting of Odin Lloyd, whose body was found a mile from Hernandez's North Attleborough home. Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez enters the courtroom for a hearing in this file photo taken last week at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts . A three page statement from Mr Belichick and a one-page statement from Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was also interviewed, were also filed as evidence in the case. But it is the text messages between Hernandez and Mr Belichick, sent and received between February and May 2013, which have got observers most excited, with the Boston Herald describing them as a 'treasure trove'. The paper said spokesmen for the Patriots and Bristol County prosecutors turned down an invitation to comment, while Hernandez's defence lawyer did not return calls. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Lloyd, a semi-professional footballer with the Boston Bandits, on June 17 of last year. He has also denied charges of murdering two men after leaving a Boston nightclub in 2012. On Monday, a judge ruled in favour of prosecutors who wanted to use footage from Hernandez's own home surveillance system as evidence against him. Judge Susan Garsh said seizure of the surveillance system 'was justified by the likelihood that it would reveal the identities of the individuals with Hernandez and Lloyd' in the hours before the shooting, the Herald reported. She hasn't yet ruled on a request to suppress evidence from other cellphones and three iPads seized from the house. On the same day, the lawyer for the cousin of Hernandez who was charged with criminal contempt after refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted him revealed she intends to change her plea to guilty. Head coach Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots watches his team play in a 2012 file photo. His text messages to Hernandez may be used as evidence against the former NFL player who is on trial for murder . Tanya Singleton, of Bristol, Connecticut, had pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say she was granted immunity but declined to testify. Peter Parker, her lawyer, said during a brief proceeding in Fall River Superior Court that she will change her plea at the trial scheduled for August 12. Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter, said sentencing for criminal contempt is at the judge's discretion. He would not comment on what the prosecutors will recommend. Singleton pleaded not guilty to a contempt charge in connection with the Boston case after refusing to testify before a Suffolk County grand jury. Mr Parker is seeking to consolidate the contempt cases in Fall River and said on Monday that his client intends to plead guilty in the Boston case, too. 'Ms. Singleton chose family over civic duty. That is not an incomprehensible or indefensible choice,' Mr Parker wrote in a court filing Monday requesting the consolidation. Singleton also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact in the Lloyd case. She isn't changing her not guilty plea in that case, Mr Parker said. Prosecutors allege Singleton helped Hernandez's 'right-hand man' Ernest Wallace travel to Florida after Lloyd was killed. They also say she discussed helping Carlos Ortiz, another Hernandez associate, flee to Puerto Rico and got rid of a cellphone that Wallace had used. Wallace and Ortiz have both pleaded not guilty to murder and accessory charges. Singleton, who has been undergoing medical treatments for breast cancer in Connecticut, was not in Fall River for Monday's hearing. She is out on bail.","Thirty-three pages of texts have been handed to Hernandez's defence team .

"By . Associated Press . Don't blame the millennial generation for lackluster home sales. They are increasingly ethnically diverse, more educated and less likely to be married — all factors that make them less likely to own a home, said a new report released Wednesday by Trulia, the online real estate firm. After adjusting for these population changes, younger Americans are actually buying homes at the same rate as they did during the late-1990s. 'For at least the past 20 years, there have been significant demographic headwinds for homeownership for young people,' said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia. A new report released by Trulia, the online real estate firm, suggests that the recession, for all its damage to the economy, did little to turn off millennials from the idea of owning a home compared to previous generations . The ownership rate among those younger than 35 has declined to 36.2 per cent from 38.6 per cent in 1997 . The analysis suggests that the recession — for all its damage to the economy — did little to turn off millennials from the idea of owning a home compared to previous generations. In fact, the report shows that the major group whose ownership rates suffered because of the downturn is middle-aged Americans. The easy credit offered during the housing bubble caused more young people to buy than they otherwise would and masked the impact of the demographic changes, according to Trulia. The bursting of that bubble and the resulting recession that began in 2007 then caused ownership to fall where it should be given the demographic shifts. Because a greater percentage of younger Americans are attending college and graduate school, they are settling down a few years later — which causes them to delay buying a home. Census figures show that the share of 18-34 year-olds who are married is 30 per cent, down from 47 per cent in 1983. Just 29 per cent of them live with children, compared to 39 per cent three decades ago. Since more people in the age range are single and childless, Trulia looked at the number of homeowners who are also identified as the head of their households. After adjusting for these population shifts, the share of people under 35-years old who own homes is the same as it was for 1997. Standard Census data, which aren't adjusted for these factors, show that the ownership rate among those younger than 35 has declined to 36.2 per cent from 38.6 per cent in 1997. Slightly less than 65 per cent of the country owns a home, down from a peak of 69 per cent in the middle of 2006. Because a greater percentage of younger Americans are attending college and graduate school, they are settling down a few years later ¿ which causes them to delay buying a home . While the weak economic rebound has affected home buying, Trulia's analysis puts more of an emphasis on demographics than much of the real estate industry has to explain poor sales. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, blames the lack of buying among younger people on the sluggish recovery, now entering its sixth year. 'It's principally the economic factors: jobs and student debt,' said Yun, noting the difficulty of saving for a down payment when earning modest wages and repaying college loans. The number of first-time homebuyers in May was near record lows at 27 per cent, versus a historic average of 40 per cent, the Realtors said last month. Yun says that as the economy continues to bounce back, so, too, will sales to first-time buyers. By contrast, Trulia found that homeownership really lags among a different age bracket: the middle-aged. After adjusting for demographic changes, it found that their ownership rate was the lowest since 1976, a clear casualty of the housing bust. That's because many Americans who are now middle-aged bought during the bubble at inflated prices with loans that they could not repay. 'It's the 35-54 year-olds who have fallen further behind,' Kolko said.","Study find younger Americans buying homes at the same rate as they did during the late-1990s .

"By . Associated Press . A Texas actress who sent ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and then-New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and tried to blame the crime on her soon-to-be ex-husband was today sentenced to 18 years in prison. A federal judge gave Shannon Guess Richardson, 36, the maximum sentence under her plea deal on a federal charge of possessing and producing a biological toxin. Richardson was also ordered to pay restitution. She had pleaded guilty to the charge in December. 'I never intended for anybody to be hurt,' she told the court, adding later, 'I'm not a bad person; I don't have it in me to hurt anyone.' Sentencing: Wearing restraints, Shannon Guess Richardson is escorted out of the federal courthouse in Texarkana, Texas on Wednesday, July 16, 2014 after she was sentenced to 18 years prison . Richardson, who had minor acting roles in film and television, said she thought security measures would prevent anyone from opening the letters addressed to Obama and the now-former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Prosecutors say Richardson mailed three letters from New Boston, outside Texarkana, then went to police and claimed that her estranged husband had done it. She was arrested last June after authorities said she tried to implicate her husband, who had filed for divorce. Prosecutors say investigators noted inconsistencies in Richardson's statements and later learned that she had purchased materials online to produce ricin, a toxin that can cause respiratory failure if inhaled. Poses: Her husband said Shannon, who had had minor roles in TV shows, had always wanted to be famous . Blamed: After sending the ricin letters to Obama and Bloomberg, she allegedly called the FBI and said that she had found notes written by her husband Nathaniel (right) to the president . She acknowledged in a signed plea agreement that she ordered castor beans online and learned how to process them into a substance used to make ricin. She obtained an email address, a PayPal shopping account and a post office box in her husband's name without his knowledge, according to the document. On the morning of May 20, 2013, she said she waited for her husband Nathan Richardson to go to work. 'After he left the house, I printed the mailing labels for President Barack Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Mark Glaze with The Raben Group,' she said in the document. At the time, Glaze was director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Bloomberg's group advocating for tougher gun control. Probe: Investigators can be seen outside the couple's home in New Boston, Texas in June . Locked up: Richardson's lawyer said the plea deal is expected to cap her sentence at 18 years . The letter to Obama read, 'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what ive got in store for you mr president,' according to the document. 'You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns. Anyone wants to come to my house will get shot in the face.' After mailing the letters, she admitted to trying to blame her husband and lying to authorities. Richardson performed minor roles in the television series 'The Walking Dead' and the movie 'The Blind Side.' She also is the mother of six children - including one born prematurely while she was in custody.","A federal judge gave Shannon Guess Richardson, 36, the maximum sentence under her plea deal on a federal charge of possessing and producing a biological toxin .

Investigators said they interviewed several people, and also checked video from surveillance cameras around downtown Newton to try and pinpoint when Daniels was last seen alive. They were also searching social media for leads, Fox 5 reported. The Daniels' family said in a statement Monday night that they are in shock at the tragic news. 'We are deeply saddened by the terrible news surrounding the death of our loved one, Maggie Daniels,' the statement reads. 'Words cannot describe the grief that we are going through right now.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The search for a well-liked Texas doctor who was reported missing after not surfacing following a shark-diving excursion in the Bahamas over the weekend has ended, the U.S. Coast Guard announced on Wednesday. No body has been recovered, but search crews found dive and camera equipment they believe belonged to 63-year-old chiropractor John E. Petty, who also was an avid photographer. Petty was part of a multi-day shark-diving excursion near Tiger Beach, a well-known spot for commercial shark-diving operations. Disappeared: The search for Texas Doctor John Petty was called off Wednesday after search crews found dive gear near where he was last seen . Eight other divers were part of the excursion, where the water is baited with chum to attract sharks, and divers enter the water without the safety of shark cages. On Sunday, when the other members of the excursion surfaced after a dive, Petty wasn't amongst them. At 8 p.m., Shear Water, the 65-foot vessel used to transport divers to the dive site, issued a distress call to alert the Coast Guard that Petty was missing. Coast Guard Petty Officer John-Paul Rios said Wednesday that a 'substantial amount' of dive gear had been found within the search area, but it could not be immediately confirmed that the gear belonged to the missing man. Tiger Beach: Tiger Beach in the Bahamas is a popular location for shark-divers, who often get in the water without cages . 'The family would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming . support and prayers on behalf of John Petty. The U.S. Coast Guard has . ceased its search as of 11:00 a.m., today,' Petty's family said in a statement given to KETK. 'After the Bahamian Government . studied the items recovered in numerous searches, it has been . determined that a shark attack was the cause. A memorial service is . being planned and details will be posted later today. Thank you all . again.' Jim Abernathy, who runs the Florida-based dive company that Petty hired for the excursion, is well-known in the world of shark diving. The website grindtv.com describes him as a 'controversial figure among the commercial shark-diving fraternity.' 'Controversial': Shark-diving professional Jim Abernathy was bitten by a shark during a 2011 dive . In 2008, a participant in one of Abernathy's excursions was fatally attacked by a shark during a dive. In 2011, Abernathy himself was bitten by a shark. He survived after being airlifted to a Florida hospital. SharkDiver.com's Patric Douglas describes Tiger Beach as 'an ongoing lab experiment.' 'Tiger Beach has been a long running experiment with large predatory . sharks and a number of ""firsts"" for the cageless shark-diving industry,' he writes on the website. 'First to night dive with these sharks, first to hand-feed these animals, . first to film a woman dressed as a mermaid with baited sharks, first to . stand tigers on their noses for paying customers in a controversial . shark interaction called ""tonic shark.""

"By . Associated Press . Crazy in love: Ramsey Fakhouri tried to make the ultimate romantic gesture by buying his girlfriend an engagement ring, but chose to pay for it by robbing his lover's bank - and now he is starting a six-year jail term . A love-struck robber raided the bank where his girlfriend worked on Valentine's Day in a bid to pay for her engagement ring - only for her to turn him in to police. Separated by hundreds of miles between his Detroit-area home and that of his Illinois would-be fiancee, Ramsey Fakhouri figured he would make the long-distance romance work by getting his sweetheart a diamond. But his choice of committing an armed robbery to make his amorous gesture has instead landed him in jail. The 22-year-old was sentenced in East St Louis, Illinois to six and a half years for his role in the hold-up last Valentine’s Day of a female worker who was restocking an automated teller machine outside the bank where his girlfriend was working. Federal prosecutors say Fakhouri, of Troy, shared with 18-year-old accomplice Alexander Gerth the $26,000 stolen during the heist. Fakhouri’s girlfriend watched the robbery unfold in horror, never knowing her beau — the one who hours later comforted her about what she saw — had such a hand in it. Authorities say in court documents that the romance began a couple of years ago when Fakhouri met the girlfriend at a Bible college. By early this year, Fakhouri was ready to ask her to be his wife, but lacked a way to pay for an engagement ring. Scene of the stick-up: Fakhouri and an accomplice stole $26,000 from a female employee who was restocking the ATM at the Bradford National Bank branch in Highland, Illinois (above, file picture) Before last February 14, while talking with his girlfriend by telephone, Fakhouri put her on speaker phone so Gerth could hear her unwittingly give details how the ATM is restocked outside her Bradford National Bank branch in Highland, Illinois, east of St. Louis. Equipped with pellet guns resembling real semi-automatic pistols, authorities say, the Michigan friends drove Fakhouri’s 2008 Ford Mustang through the night to southern Illinois — getting a $120 speeding ticket along the way — and waited outside the bank for it to open. At one point, he watched the girlfriend pull onto the bank’s lot to start her shift. She even called to wish Fakhouri a good morning, unaware he was there. About 8.30am, prosecutors say that Gerth — masked and wielding the pellet gun — robbed the branch manager after she came out to refill the drive-up ATM. The girlfriend's reaction likely shattered any illusion Fakhouri may have had of pursuing a Bonnie-and-Clyde style criminal romance like the infamous lovers (above) who looted banks across America in the 1930s . With Fakhouri driving the getaway car, the two suspects fled and were returning to Michigan when Fakhouri’s girlfriend texted him, voicing fears about the robbery she’d just seen. Fakhouri later told investigators Gerth dropped him off in Indianapolis, and he took a Greyhound bus back to comfort his girlfriend. Later, after the girlfriend received texted surveillance photos of the alleged bank robbers visiting a Walmart near the robbed bank, Fakhouri admitted to her that one of the images was of him and she told police. Her reaction likely shattered any illusion he may have had of pursuing a Bonnie-and-Clyde style criminal romance like the infamous lovers who looted banks across America in the 1930s. Gerth, arrested in Michigan three days after the hold-up, pleaded guilty in April and awaits sentencing next month.","Ramsey Fakhouri wanted ring to make long-distance romance work .

Kanye's spokesperson insists claims are 'without merit' By . Sarah Bull . A Canadian model claims rapper Kanye West cheated on pregnant girlfriend Kim Kardashian after they met at one of his shows. In stunning claims Leyla Ghobadi, 24, told America's Star magazine that their fling started in July 2012 and continued even after Kim had announced her pregnancy after Kanye dismissed his relationship with the reality star as just 'for publicity and nothing serious'. Explaining her decision to reveal the relationship, brunette Leyla said: 'This is going to destroy the Kardashian family. It’s bad. It’s really . bad. It’s just embarrassing. But if I were Kim and about to have a baby, . I would want to know.' Scroll down for video . 'If I was Kim and about to have a baby, I'd want to know': Leyla Ghobadi has claimed Kanye cheated on Kim with her . Determined: But Kanye is said to have set his . sights on the model who bears more than a passing resemblance to Kim, and offered her and her friends backstage passes . and free tickets to his next gig the following night . Setting his sights on her: It's not hard to see what Kanye reportedly saw in Leyla, a 24-year-old model from Canada . Kim's representatives have denied the reports, while Kanye's added: 'This most recent attack on Kanye West and his family is totally without merit. 'It's a blatant attempt by a misguided individual who is clearly seeking publicity, and another in a series of malicious stories drummed up by non-credible ""news"" sources.' This is a sad attempt to hurt two people trying to live their lives.' Kanye is said to have first set his sights on curvy model Leyla when he saw her dancing in the crowd at his show in Atlantic City in July last year. And despite Kim also being present at the gig in Revel’s Ovation Hall, Kanye reportedly instructed a member of his entourage to seek out Leyla and invite her backstage. The rapper is then reported to have invited Leyla for cocktails at AC’s HQ Nightclub, before asking her to come back to his hotel room. Imminent arrival: Kanye looked less than happy as he stepped out in New York on Monday, while Kim counts down the days until her fast approaching due date . Working up until she pops: Kim was seen on Tuesday shooting scenes for Keeping Up With The Kardashians at her Malibu mansion . Centre of attention: Kim dressed in slimming black as she shot scenes getting out of her car at the property . However, Leyla declined, adding to the publication: 'I refused, as I felt it was too rushed.' Kanye . then reportedly asked Leyla and her friends, who had driven down from . Montreal to watch his show, if they wanted to attend the concert the . next evening, and gave them backstage passes. And while Leyla admits she knew Kanye was with Kim at the time, she said the 36-year-old musician told her the relationship was 'for publicity and nothing serious'. Bikini body: Leyla initially refused Kanye's advances, but then says she gave in and accompanied him back to his hotel room .

After agreeing to accompany Kanye back to his hotel room after chatting to him backstage, Leyla said: 'We began to make out for a while - and next thing I knew, we were both naked and having sex.' The couple's next reported meeting came in October in New York, as Kim, who had not announced her pregnancy at that point, was in Miami. Leyla even alleges that Kanye contacted her just last weekend to see if she wanted to meet up, but said that at that point she was fully aware of Kim's pregnancy, adding: 'I would never do that to someone.' As they were: Kanye and Kim looked very much in love as they added the Met Ball together in New York on 6th May . Kim and Kanye announced her pregnancy in December 2012, with Kanye revealing the happy baby news to the crowd during a concert in Atlantic City. The rapper said 'stop the music', then . announced 'make noise for my baby mama right here,' with a wide smile. Kanye and Kim had been dating for eight months at that point, but have been friends for a number of years. In a lengthy interview he gave to the New York Times to promote his forthcoming album Yeezus, Kanye spoke about his reasons for not participating in Keeping In The Kardashians, his love for Kim and becoming a father. He said: 'I’m the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I’m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires me. Catching her eye: Leyla alleges that Kanye sent one of his team to ask her backstage after this performance at Revel's Ovation Hall in Atlantic City in July 2012 . 'You know, the amount of backlash I . got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it’s . not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the . amount of backlash that I get. Because I just see like, an amazing . person that I’m in love with that I want to help.' On becoming a father he said his first instinct is to be protective of his baby - and its privacy. He said: 'I would do anything to . protect my child or my child’s mother. As simple as that...I just don’t . want to talk to America about my family. Like, this is my baby. This . isn’t America’s baby.' The couple have looked very much in love in recent months as they prepare for the arrival of their first child together. However, . their lack of time together in recent weeks has hit headlines, with the . couple's last outing together coming in mid-May. But .

A source told RadarOnline.com: 'Kim is so close to giving birth and she's big and uncomfortable and knowing Kanye partied with all of their friends really made her mad.' The party goes on: Top model Joan Smalls and Peter Dundas also attended the listening part for Kanye's new album which is released Monday . The rapper celebrated with his friends including Beyonce, Jay-Z, Nas, Kim's older sister Kourtney Kardashian and her boyfriend, Scott Disick, as well as her best friend Jonathan Cheban at Jamaican restaurant Ms. Lily's, because he was performing at the Governor's Ball in the city on Sunday, but Kim wanted him to delay his party and have it in Los Angeles instead. The source said: 'She isn't traveling this late in her pregnancy but everyone else there could have easily come to Los Angeles, they all can hop on a private plane any time they want! 'Kim totally respects Kanye and the work he has to do, but as her due date grows closer she is getting mad about how little time they're spending together and wishes that he would try and accommodate her more.'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Axing thousands of soldiers may have put the country at 'significant risk', the Government's spending watchdog has revealed in a blistering report published today. The National Audit Office said the decision to cut the army's regular forces from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018, while ramping up the number of reservists, was taken without testing whether it could work. It also revealed the plan was running up to six years behind schedule - leaving the army dangerously short of soldiers. The report said the cuts may 'significantly affect the Army's ability to achieve its objectives'. David Cameron defended the Government's army cuts at Prime Minister's Questions today. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (second right) said the strength of the army reserve was growing for the first time in nearly 20 years . The former head of the Army Lord Dannatt said even if the goal of increasing reservist numbers is met by 2018, there will be at least three years before then when the Army is under strength. He warned that this could leave the country at risk. He said: 'If it stays relatively quiet and we are not committed anywhere then the risk will not materialise, but if something happens, the strategic shocks happen, and we are terribly bad about spotting them, then we could be embarrassed and we could be in some difficulty.' Audit office chief Amyas Morse added: 'Army 2020 requires an overall reduction in the size of the Army and a fundamental change to its composition, with a significant reduction in the number of regulars and a substantial increase in the number of trained reserves. 'Military judgment played an important role in decisions but committing to moving towards an Army structure with fewer regular soldiers and an increased number of reserves within the planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility. 'The Department and Army must get a better understanding of significant risks to Army 2020.' Ministers said the overhaul of the army was needed to save cash - helping the Ministry of Defence save £10.6billion over 10 years. But the National Audit Office said it could actually end up costing taxpayers more. Audit office chief Amyas Morse said: 'The planned timescale should have been subject to more rigorous testing of feasibility.' He added that the risk of a shortfall in the recruitment of new reserves could 'up the pressure on regular units'. Labour's Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge said she was 'astounded' that despite the military cuts the cost of army to the taxpayer may actually go up . Margaret Hodge, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, added: 'The Ministry of Defence focused heavily on cutting costs rather than on recruiting, training and integrating a substantially increased number of reserves, something the Army is already failing to do.' She added: 'Even after all this, I am astounded to find that reducing the size of the Army will not alone deliver the financial savings required for the MoD budget. 'Unbelievably, it may even mean increased costs to the Treasury if the reservists are deployed.' The Army 2020 re-structuring programme forms part of the package of defence cuts originally set out in the Coalition's 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. It will see the regular Army reduced to its lowest level since the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said the restructuring plans were 'in danger of collapse'. He said: 'This devastating report points to a litany of errors and serious failings at the Ministry of Defence under David Cameron. 'Defence ministers were warned that these plans would not work unless they were properly tested and monitored. 'They were told that front-loading cuts to the Army and back-ending recruitment to the reserves would leave the Armed Forces under strength. They didn't listen and now they're in a complete mess.' Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall (left) defended the 'Army 2020' plan to overhaul the service. He said the plan 'will endure' the test of time . General Sir Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff, said: 'The NAO report fails to capture the nature of the austerity we faced at the time these decisions were made. 'The Army has designed a novel and imaginative structure which best meets the challenges we are likely to face within the resources made available. 'Thankfully, most of the structural change for our new model, which we call Army 2020, is now behind us. 'We are recruiting regular and reserve soldiers for this new Army avidly. I am confident that, having made such significant changes, the Army 2020 model will endure.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The MoD has always been clear that the numbers in the Reserves would fall before they increased, but we have now seen the trained strength of the Reserves climb for the first time in nearly 20 years.' Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said the Government inherited a reserve that had been 'under-resourced and undervalued for years'. 'We now have a five-year programme for building them up. 'That programme is under way, it is gathering pace. What we are going to see is the strongest possible professional Army with all of the best equipment they could have, and a very strong reserve force backing up, making sure we can meet all of the obligations we set out in the Strategic Defence Review.'","Spending watchdog says army cuts pushed through without proper checks .

"By . Jack Doyle . Pay row: Lady Stowell arrives at Downing Street in London yesterday . David Cameron was last night accused of a ‘constitutional outrage’ after he demoted the woman chosen to be new leader of the House of Lords. The upper house was united in anger after it emerged Baroness Stowell would not be a full member of the Cabinet – unlike her predecessor. The appointment was already controversial after it emerged she would be paid £22,000 less than Lord Hill of Oareford, who is moving on to be the UK’s next EU commissioner. Downing Street officials were left red-faced when it was revealed she would receive less for doing the same job as a man in a reshuffle supposed to promote women. They hurriedly announced her pay would be topped up by the Conservative Party. But this too has provoked outrage in the upper house. Yesterday Lords demanded to know how she could represent the whole house – as her role demands – when she is part paid by a political party. They pointed to House of Lords standing orders – the rules of the chamber – which demand the leader of the house should be a full member of the Cabinet. The new arrangement will see her attend meetings but not have Cabinet status,  breaking, it was claimed, a precedent dating back 112 years. Yesterday Labour referred the appointment to a powerful constitutional committee and it was condemned by peers from all parties amid near riotous scenes in the Lords. Mr Cameron defended the arrangement at Prime Ministers’s Questions, saying: ‘I’m happy to confirm that she will do the same job as her predecessor, will sit in the same place around the table as her predecessor, and will receive the same money.’ Labour leader in the Lords Baroness Royall said Lady Stowell’s lack of full Cabinet status showed contempt for the house. She described the salary top-up as ‘improper and unethical’. Are rejects Fox and Paterson cooking up trouble for PM? She added: ‘When I heard about this yesterday, I simply did not believe it could be true, but when it was then confirmed later in the day, I was deeply dismayed that the Prime Minister could treat this house with such contempt.’ Former Labour attorney general Baroness Scotland called on Mr Cameron to reconsider. She told Lady Stowell: ‘Will you convey to him in the strongest possible way that it is this house’s view that he has committed what amounts to a constitutional outrage that this house does not accept.’ The debate was prompted by an urgent question from former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth, who said it was vital the leader of the Lords was a full member of the Cabinet. He said: ‘What sort of signal does that send to the civil service and others about the authority of this place in its important duty in revising legislation?’ On Tuesday, Downing Street confirmed that Lady Stowell would be paid the Lords’ minister of state salary of £78,891 a year, compared with £101,038 for her predecessor. The fall was due to a legal limit on the number of full Cabinet posts and the reshuffle meant there were not enough seats to go around.","Baroness Stowell would have been paid £22,000 less than predecessor .

"A drastic fall in the number of teenage pregnancies is partly the result of youngsters spending much of their time on Facebook and other social media, experts said yesterday. Fewer than 30,000 babies were born to girls under 20 in England and Wales last year, official figures showed – down from more than 45,000 in 2006. The total is now at its lowest since 1951. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, also showed the average age of a new mother was 30, up from 29.8 in 2012. It is the oldest age of motherhood since such calculations were first made in 1938, and ONS officials said it was certainly the highest ever. The spectacular fall in teenage pregnancy does not appear to be connected to Labour’s Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, which concentrated on more sex education and the distribution of condoms . The spectacular fall in teenage pregnancy does not appear to be connected to Labour’s Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, which concentrated on more sex education and the distribution of condoms. The strategy was halted in 2010 but numbers of babies born to teenagers have dropped by more than a quarter since then. Analysts suggest that one of the biggest changes in recent years is the rise in social media, which means teenagers are interacting on their phones and computers rather than mixing out on the streets – where they are more likely to indulge in underage sex. Professor David Paton of Nottingham University said the rise in numbers of girls going into higher education and increasing influence of aspirational immigrant families who discourage single motherhood has also had an impact, as has the morning after pill and new and effective long-term contraception through injections or implants. However, he added: ‘Facebook use amongst teenagers was just getting off the ground in a significant way in 2007. It is hard to deny that social networking applications have changed the way teenagers interact in fundamental ways. ‘Is it too much of a stretch to suggest that, for at least some teenagers, the amount of time spent interacting virtually with friends on a smartphone has led to fewer physical opportunities to engage in drinking, drugs and underage sex?’ The rise among older mothers has also that meant for the first time, more babies were born in 2013 to women over 40 than teenage girls. With so many youngsters spending so much time online, they are not finding the time to sleep around . Older motherhood, the breakdown from the ONS said yesterday, follows more women going into higher education and careers, rising costs of having children and housing, and the ‘instability of partnerships’. The ONS count of births in England and Wales last year showed a sharp fall overall in births in 2013 to 698,512, down 4.3per cent from the 729,674 born in 2012. It was the lowest for six years and put the decade-long baby boom into reverse. More children born to parents who are married . However birthrates among immigrants, who have higher fertility rates than women among the longstanding population, remained high. The share of babies born to women who were themselves born outside England and Wales went up, from 25.9 per cent in 2012, to 26.5 per cent last year.","Fewer than 30,000 babies were born to under 20s in England and Wales last year .

"By . Christian Gysin . Glassy-eyed and bare-chested as he clutches a drink in a nightclub, England cricketer Gary Ballance looks as though he is celebrating a fantastic victory. But the photograph was taken just hours after England had failed to defeat India on Sunday, leaving  followers of the national team lamenting a string of nine successive Test matches without victory – the  longest run for more than 20 years. The 24-year-old batsman was later  carried out of the bar in Nottingham after telling incredulous fans: ‘I’m not a cricketer tonight. I’m just a  drunken b*****d.’ Topless: England batsman Gary Ballance (left) was seen knocking back shots and posing for photos without his top on in Pandora's Box nightclub in Nottingham just hours after drawing a test match against India . The Harrow-educated sports star later shouted that he was ‘absolutely f***ed’. His drunken antics emerged after  photographs surfaced of England  footballers larking about with champagne and cigars after their failure to win a game in the World Cup finals in Brazil. Goalkeeper Joe Hart was pictured apparently spitting drink into the mouth of Arsenal’s midfield star Jack Wilshere who was also seen smoking a cigarette and cigar in a Las Vegas pool. With pundits and fans still discussing how far England have fallen – and why – in both football and cricket, it seems that some of our top players are rather less concerned. Ballance – who had a fine innings in the game, scoring 71 runs  – was joined in Nottingham’s  Pandora’s Box club on Sunday after close of play at Trent Bridge by teammates Joe Root, Jimmy Anderson and Liam Plunkett. Off the field antics: Other people inside the club said they heard the Yorkshire player shouting: 'I'm not a cricketer tonight, I'm just a drunken b*****d' On the pitch: Ballance scored 71 in the first innings of the match at Trent Bridge which ended in a draw . It was reported that Ballance bought . large vodkas for a group of girls and tipped the bar staff £20 – and put . on a drunken dancing display for punters who watched him knocking back . drinks until closing time. ‘They had to carry him out at the end of the night,’ said one witness. ‘He was standing outside with his top off screaming “England! England! England!’’’ His behaviour was all the more surprising because England have to start another five-day Test match against India this morning. The players had been given permission to go out on Sunday night ahead of a rest day on Monday. But his boisterous ‘re-fuelling’ will have angered many cricket fans who are desperately hoping that England can end their winless streak when the Second Test starts at Lord’s today. Senior figures in the England and Wales Cricket Board will also be unimpressed, as they do not need yet another headache. Bowler Anderson is facing a ban from Test cricket after being charged by cricket chiefs with pushing India player Ravindra Jadeja. Last night England team coach Peter Moores appeared to be taking a lenient approach to Ballance – at least in public. No repercussions: The ECB, cricket's governing body, issued a statement saying they were aware Ballance had been out drinking, but said he would not face any disciplinary action because he hadn't broken any curfews . England's finest: The pictures of the cricketer emerged just days after footballer Jack Wilshire was caught smoking in a Las Vegas swimming pool. He went on holiday with friends after a dismal World Cup performance . Mouth-to-mouth: He was also seen messing with goalkeeper Joe Hart, surrounded by bikini-clad women . Venue: Witnesses said Ballance had to be carried from Pandora's Box in Nottingham at the end of the night . He said: ‘As the players had been released at the end of the first Test and were not due to meet up to begin preparations for the second Test until  Monday evening, and there were no suggestions of impropriety, there is no need for any disciplinary action. I will however be reminding all players of their responsibilities to uphold the best possible image for England cricket.’ Moores’ apparent leniency follows that of team captain Alastair Cook who last month defended players Joe Root and Sam Robson after they were spotted stumbling out of a London nightclub.  ‘That’s just an age thing,’ said Cook. ‘Having a night out with a few of the boys is fine.’ As the England management team were looking after the public fall-out from the episode, there was no comment from Ballance last night.","The batsman was pictured holding up a drink in Pandora's Box, Nottingham .

"By . Tamara Cohen And Jack Doyle . Pressure is growing on ministers to release secret flight records linked to the rendition of terror suspects – as they have now dried out. The Foreign Office attracted claims of a cover-up last week when it told an MP who asked for the details of flights to and from the British island of Diego Garcia, that they had been ‘water damaged’. Mark Simmonds, a foreign office minister added to the farce yesterday when he said the records, held by officials on the tiny territory in the Indian Ocean have now been salvaged. David Miliband (left) was the Labour Foreign Secretary who admitted that rendition to Diego Garcia had been used twice; Tory MP David Davis (right) asked about the status of the logs of flights which have passed through Diego Garcia between January 2002 and January 2009 . In a rambling answer, Mr Simmonds said officials had recently noticed the damage to the logs, which he said was caused by a roof leak during heavy weather. The documents are now, he said, in the process of being taken to a new location. The government only admitted in 2008 that the island, which has a vast US military base, was linked to the rendition programme - after years of denying any involvement. David Miliband, then foreign secretary, admitted it had been used twice for re-fuelling of rendition flights in 2002, during the months after the 9/11 terror attacks. Rendition is the practice of taking terror suspects to be interrogated in other countries with less stringent human rights regulations. It was said to have been used to allow the torture of suspects. Ministers insist the suspects never left the plane during refuelling. But reports in the US claim the island hosted a secret prison and that it hosted more rendition flights in the following years. Documents uncovered after the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in Libya in 2011 suggest the US sought to use Diego Garcia as a stopover during the 2004 rendition of Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a leading Gaddafi opponent, and his pregnant wife. The pair are taking legal action against M16, which is also being investigated by Scotland Yard. Cori Crider, the director of the legal charity Reprieve and lawyer for Abdel-Hakim Belhadj, said there was no evidence of heavy rain in the area in June of this year when they claim the damage occurred. ‘It’s unclear what exactly the Foreign Office means by heavy weather’, she said. ‘Perhaps there is a micro-climate over the hut on Diego Garcia where all the embarrassing files are kept? ‘In any event, it’s hardly an answer to say they’ve got out a hair dryer and patched the roof; the FCO needs to hand the documents over to Parliament, before some other invisible monsoon strikes. ‘And they need to take steps to retrieve the lost information from 2004, the year my clients Abdel-Hakim Belhadj and his wife were scheduled to be rendered via the island.’ Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who has fought for years to get hold of the secret flight records, was told the 2002 records were ‘incomplete due to water damage’ in a parliamentary answer last week. Yesterday Tory MP David Davis, asked again about the status of the logs of flights which have passed through Diego Garcia between January 2002 and January 2009. The US Navy Support Facility at Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory . Mr Simmonds said: ‘During routine work to add existing records to the store in Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) immigration officials noted water damage to a small number of records, caused by a leaking roof. This is believed to have resulted from extremely heavy weather in June 2014. Diego Garcia may have been used as a stopover during the 2004 rendition of Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a leading Gaddafi opponent, and his pregnant wife . ‘Although the extent of the damage was not clear on initial inspection at the time…records from 2002 appeared to be incomplete due to water damage. However, since my answer of 8 July, BIOT immigration officials have conducted a fuller inspection, and previously wet paper records have been dried out. ‘They report that no flight records have been lost as a result of the water damage. A small number of immigration arrival cards from 2004 have been damaged, but that information about those flights is still available in the daily occurrence logs and monthly statistics. These records provide dates of aircraft movements in the Territory, and passenger and crew numbers. ‘Following the incident, all hard copy records from the affected location are being transferred from the airport to a new location, and will be digitalised over the coming months.’ The US has a vast military base on the island. It was revealed in 2008 they had secretlyused the island as part of its rendition programme without informing British ministers. Last month MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee said the US must provide binding commitments over use of Diego Garcia if it is to be allowed to carry on using it, as public confidence had been damaged by the disclosure.","Damage caused by a leaky roof during heavy weather related to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean .

"By . James Chapman . and Jason Groves . David Cameron’s biggest reshuffle of his top team was beginning to unravel last night amid a storm of controversy. Two of his key appointments quickly ran into trouble and there was anger over a plan to compensate ousted ministers with knighthoods or major international jobs. With Labour claiming ‘the wheels were coming off’, the Government scrambled to deal with the apparently unforeseen consequences of the ministerial shake-up. Furore: David Cameron's controversial reshuffle of his top team has already been hit by a storm of controversy . As the backlash intensified, it emerged that: . * Mr Cameron’s candidate to be Britain’s next EU commissioner, Lord Hill, is to be forced to sell his shares in a lobbying company following warnings his appointment could be vetoed; . * His replacement as leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, was downgraded below full Cabinet status – to the fury of fellow peers; . * Four senior figures who left the Government are to be given knighthoods or honours in what Labour said was an ‘abuse’ of patronage; . * The ousted leader of the House of Commons, Andrew Lansley, is being lined up to replace former Labour Cabinet minister Baroness Amos in a senior United Nations post. Conflict of interest: David Cameron has nominated Lord Hill to be the UK's next European Commissioner . In Brussels, British officials said Lord Hill would divest himself of what is thought to be a significant shareholding in the lobbying giant Huntsworth, which is owned by Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour and constituency chairman Lord Chadlington. The move, expected to be confirmed today, follows claims that the firm’s activities in Brussels might represent a conflict of interest for Lord Hill. At home, there was uproar in the second chamber after it emerged its new leader, Baroness Stowell, will not be a full member of the Cabinet – unlike predecessors for the last 112 years. Labour suggested the expected awards for departing ministers indicated Mr Cameron was using the honours system and patronage to reward those who went quietly in Tuesday’s ‘night of the long knives’, which saw 11 men leave the Government. Mr Lansley, who has previously joked that he once told the Prime Minister he wanted to be made ‘Governor general of Bermuda’, is expected to be nominated to succeed Lady Amos as the UN’s under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs. The appointment would make Mr Lansley, who was the Prime Minister’s boss at the Conservative Research Department, the most senior British figure at the world body. The appointment is made by the UN secretary general, but usually after a signal from a world leader. Mr Cameron smoothed the path for Lady Amos’s appointment in 2010. Sir John Holmes, the former British ambassador to Paris, was appointed to the post on the say-so of Tony Blair, who gave him the job as a consolation prize after he declined to appoint him as ambassador to Washington or as head of the Foreign Office. Ex-ministers who will get knighthoods include Alan Duncan, who left his post as international development minister, and Hugh Robertson, a Foreign Office minister and former Olympics minister. They are in line to be made knights commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. Oliver Heald, who was solicitor general, will also be knighted. Veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, 74, who also left the Government this week, is being chosen for one of the highest honours in the land, becoming a companion of honour. This elite order is conferred by the sovereign for service of national importance, independently of Downing Street. Soon to be a sir? Alan Duncan . Recipients include astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, naturalist David Attenborough and former prime minister John Major. Labour did not question Mr Clarke’s expected honour, given his service to politics for more than 40 years. But Michael Dugher, the party’s Cabinet Office spokesman, said of the other awards: ‘Dishing out hush-hush honours and gongs as golden goodbyes, just to keep his sacked ministers happy, also shows how weak David Cameron is. The wheels have all come off Cameron’s reshuffle. ‘He was so busy organising photo ops that he’s forgotten to do the real work.’ London Labour MP Stephen Pound said: ‘I’ve nothing against long-service medals, but using honours to sweeten the pill of dismissal is an abuse.’ Challenged in the Commons, Mr Cameron said: ‘I make no apology for saying that I think in public life we should recognise public service, people who have worked hard, people who have contributed to our nation, contributed to our government. That is a good thing to do.’ Downing Street refused to confirm any of the expected gongs. But a source said: ‘These sorts of awards have long been conferred for public service. In terms of Hugh Robertson, he played an absolutely pivotal role in the Olympics which was one of the greatest events of modern times.’ In 2012, several ministers who lost their government positions were similarly recommended to the Queen for honours and Labour made like recommendations while in power. She was dubbed the queen of the Downing Street ‘catwalk’ after being pictured sashaying to Number 10  in the Cabinet reshuffle. Yesterday, however, Employment Minister Esther McVey chose a rather more practical look as she visited a bicycle factory with David Cameron. Gone were the high heels and glamorous split skirt. Instead, she and the Prime Minister showed they were getting straight down to business with matching steel toecapped trainers provided by the Brompton Bicycle factory in west London. Miss McVey laughed off any suggestion she was unhappy at being referred to as a catwalk queen in media coverage, telling reporters it was ‘fine if it inspires girls to go into politics’.","Tories ousted from top jobs tipped for peerages and international roles .

"By . Richard Spillett . An official photography firm for university graduation ceremonies is offering students the chance to airbrush their pictures to make them looker 'slimmer and healthier'. Success Photography offers appearance-conscious graduates a celebrity-style digital makeover to reduce the effect of what is calls 'bulky and unflattering' academic gowns. But students have hit out at the £9.95 service, branding it another form of 'fat-shaming'. Students have criticised a photography company who offered them the chance to 'touch-up' their graduation photos to make them look 'healthier and slimmer' The Surrey-based company's website gives students three options for manipulating their pictures; 'Complexion Touch-up' for £9.95, 'Digital Complexion and Smile Enhancement' for £7.95 and 'Digital Slimming' for £9.95. The second option allows students to 'remove all imperfections such as blemishes, redness and shine, leaving skin looking smooth and healthy'. The 'Digital Slimming' option reads: 'The traditional graduation gown is a mark of respect and achievement. However it can be bulky and unflattering. 'With advanced digital technology we can reduce the gown's appearance, making it more fitting to your shape.' History and Politics student Sophie Gadd took to Twitter to complain about the company, who were covering her graduation ceremony at the University of York. She said: 'I can pay £9.95 to have my graduation pictures photoshopped to make me look thinner :( Literally, what? You're wearing a giant billowing cloak.' The company's website offers students the chance to have their complexion 'touched-up' to reduce blemishes . Another £9.95 option appeals to graduates concerned their academic gowns are 'bulky and unflattering' Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, another graduate, who finished his degree at the same university, said: 'Surely this is a bad joke? 'They've squeezed us for every penny, with rising fees and rent, forcing many students such as myself to adopt an unhealthy lifestyle of cheap food because that's all we can afford. 'And on our final day they're asking for another tenner to remove the weight I've put on because I've not been able to afford fresh fruit and veg. It's sickening. This is just another example of fat-shaming.' The  company describe themselves as the 'leading Graduation photography specialist' and are employed by several higher education institutions including St Andrews, York, Newcastle, Nottingham Trent, Imperial College London, Oxford Brookes, Exeter, Birmingham, Royal Holloway and Loughborough. They have insisted the service is not meant to make people look thinner. They tweeted: 'Just to make clear ""digital slimming"" refers to reducing the appearance of the gown only, never the individual.' Students have mocked the service online, joking that any weight they have put on is due to their budget diet . A series of leaked photos have shown how the images of celebrities appearing in adverts and photoshoots have often been manipulated. In 2004, actress Keira Knightley complained after her body was altered in a poster for hit film King Arthur. She said 'those things certainly weren't mine' after photos showed the size of her bust had been digitally increased. Keira Knightley was left angry after an image of her in the poster for King Arthur was altered in the studio . A photoshoot involving Jessica Alba was also digitally altered to give the model a thinner waistline . In 2008, leaked pictures showed model Jessica Alba's body had also been airbrushed during a fashion photoshoot. The altered version of the picture showed her with a narrower chin and more make-up. The touched-up picture also seemed to have removed some flesh from her already slim thighs and added some definition to her upper body. In 2010, Britney Spears released pre-airbrushed images from a shoot she took part in for fashion firm Candie's. Singer Britney Spears released un-edited photos of herself in 2010 to show the pressure women are under . The singer made the move in order to highlight the pressure exerted on women to look perfect. So-called 'imperfections' that can be seen in the un-airbrushed shot, such as blemishes on her calf, are removed in the altered version. The size of her thighs and waist were also changed using computers. Earlier this week, website Jezebel published before and after pictures of Mariah Carey from a photoshoot. The singer's appearance (below) was clearly altered to make her appear slimmer and more tanned.","Official photographers for  university graduations offer airbrush service .
