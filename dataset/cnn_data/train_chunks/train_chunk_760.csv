Mr Deere said: He said: 'I've long held a fascination with interesting spaces, and the way that we relate to them' The photographer said some of the seemingly endless tunnels were so dark that even experienced map readers would struggle to navigate their way around. Due to each tunnel's similarity and the fact it's pitch black it's also extremely difficult to capture his amazing shots. Some of Mr Deere's best work has come from the now-abandoned Box Freestone Mine, Wiltshire, which ceased operation in 1968. Before then the mine had been used to extract Bath Stone for the city of Bath's buildings since the Roman occupation of Britain.

A chilling archive belonging to an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth has emerged to highlight how the Nazis brainwashed youngsters. Teenager Helmut Nieboy kept detailed diaries, records and maps during his time with the German equivalent of the Boy Scouts from 1933. He also amassed a number of photographs showing youngsters who went on to fight and die for the Third Reich, sitting around a campfire, marching and at rallies. Nazi zeal: Helmut Nieboy (left) during his time in the Hitler Youth, while the picture on the right shows how he signed off his diary entries with 'Heil Hitler' Helmut Nieboy's 'KamaradSchaft Florian Geyer' Hitler Youth company on parade . He kept his Swastika-emblazoned tent and trumpet and his sinister 6ins bladed dagger, a far cry from a simple penknife the British Boy Scouts would have used. The diaries include incredibly detailed maps showing route marches the young members were sent on as well as hand drawn portraits of the Fuhrer with patriotic slogans. The journals also contain lists of fellow members and those who failed to graduate, their ultimate fate left ominously unrecorded with a single red line through their name.

Nieboy's dagger is a far cry from a simple penknife the British Boy Scouts would have used . Helmut Nieboy's Hitler Youth bugle, which will also be sold at the auction at Mullock's of Shropshire . The records are written in Helmut's neat handwriting and his fanaticism is clear, on one page he takes great care to write 'Heil Hitler'. Helmut was one of 2.3million members of the Hitler Youth in 1933. The paramilitary organisation was for boys aged 14 to 18 who were brainwashed into being part of Hitler's twisted idyll to build an Aryan super-race. Members went on to become soldiers for the German military machine, with skilled fighters joining the Waffen SS. A member of the Hitler Youth pictured blowing a bugle .

During the war, the young members were drafted into the German Home Guard and then acted as the last line of the defence of Berlin in 1945. After the war most Hitler Youth members were keen to hide their affiliation and so archives such as Helmut's are rare today. His was recently unearthed in Germany but is now being sold at auction at Mullock's of Ludlow, Shropshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £4,000.

Training: The Hitler Youth was the Third Reich's way of developing young men for their armed forces . ‘His tent, knife and trumpet are all among the collection that has remarkably stayed together. ‘Most similar archives would have been destroyed following the war as most people would want to erase evidence of their being in the Hitler Youth. ‘This youth was clearly committed and with his neat diaries and organisational skills I expect he had enjoyed promotion to the armed services by the time the war began. ‘Sadly, there is nothing to say what happened to Helmut.’ Also in the archive is a book of minutes and reports of the meetings of Helmut's group, notes of marching songs the boys sang and political discussions. It also includes diplomas for his prowess in sport and an account of his attendance at one of the Nuremberg rallies.

"A second elephant was also caught stepping over a electric fence near the Kruger National Park in South Africa . By . Mark Shapland . PUBLISHED: . 10:38 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 5 March 2014 . Incredible . snaps have been taken of the moment when Nellie the elephant . skillfully manages to step over a barbed wire fence put up by a farmer in Africa. The four ton beast has chosen to roam across Africa by daintily skipping over fences instead of trampling everything in its wake. It elegantly lifts its front . right leg over the wire, taking care not to touch it, then its left leg . before repeating the process with its hind legs. After one final push it is free and ready to hunt for food. The photos show that Nellie clearly has respect for her surroundings and doesn't want to be blamed for any damage. Elephants are known for their intelligence and ability to solve problems - Nellie's antics confirm how true that is. Scroll down for video . Clever fella: The elephant skillfully steps over the farmer's barbed wire fence, choosing not to trample all over it . Easy does it: His front right leg goes over first while keeping upright . The images were posted on Facebook by Indri Ultimate Wildlife Tours, of Cape Town, South Africa, which said: 'Our feeling when looking at these photographs is one of utter respect.' They will come as no surprise to scientists who have studied elephants brains, particularly when confronted with danger. Their ability to remember means elephants can dodge not just fences but droughts too. The theory is that older females memorise earlier severe droughts and how the elephants at the time survived it. This means they know where to find distant food and water sources giving them a better chance of survival as climate change becomes a real threat to their natural habitats. Acrobatic: The elephant makes the whole process look easy despite his size and having four legs . Nearly there: Nellie proves she's no Dumbo and is now close to escaping . Strolls away: The elephant successfully negotiates the fence and free is to roam . But Nellie isn't the only elephant dodging obstacles across Africa. A second elephant was also caught on film skillfully having to avoid a electric fence in Mpumalanga, near the Kruger National Park. This time the cheeky little elephant steps over the fence to . grab a branch from a much-loved marula fruit tree in the back garden of a house. The elephant is clearly keen to avoid past . experiences such as being tangled up or electrocuted by a nasty fence. After having his snack the young male . then lifts both legs back over the fence carefully - despite no . current being passed through the electric fence. Magdel van den Berg, the journalist who filmed the baby elephant, said: 'It was quite strange to see the elephant do this but it is marula fruit season and elephants love them. He remembered the fence for sure, he is a regular visitor to the area. It was interesting to see an animal think and plan its way around the . obstacles, the owner of the property has reported him going as far as . their front door, up hills and over more fences. Quite a busy little boy . he is.' Sadly not all elephants find it so easy to adapt to their manmade surroundings and can experience horrific accidents while roaming. In May last year four elephants were killed after they became trapped on a railway line and were hit by a speeding train. The elephants were part of a herd crossing the railroad tracks in eastern India when the express passenger train ploughed into them. Two adult female elephants and one calf were killed at the scene while another died later from its injuries. Dozens of elephants have died in recent . years in such accidents as trains run through national parks and . forests. Activists have called for trains to lower their speeds through . such areas. Strong memory: This young elephant skillfully avoids the electric fence - he's clearly had a shocking experience before . Best foot forward: He's determined to reach his favourite marula fruit tree and nothing will stand in his way . One step at a time: The elephant breaches the fence and enjoys his lunch reaching out for a branch in the back garden of a house .","Nellie the elephant steps over a barbed wire fence, knowing one false move could result in big trouble .

U.S. universities remain atop the list of the world's rankings of the most reputable institutions of higher education, according to the recently released 2014 World Reputation Rankings. Harvard University in Boston tops the Times Higher Education Reputation Rankings, with Massachusetts Institute of Technology taking the number two spot. Stanford University in California was ranked third in the world, according to the rankings. Top: Harvard in the US is ranked highest in the table, based on surveys of 10,536 academics in 150 countries . Mass: Massachusetts Institute of Technology took the number two spot on the Times Higher Education rankings . In all, American universities took 46 of the top 100 positions. The rankings are based on surveys of 10,536 academics in 150 countries. In general, the reputations of U.S. universities are gradually improving - for example, New York University has jumped to 27th since 2011, when it was ranked in the 51 to 60 grouping. Columbia University also has seen an improvement in the rankings since 2011, jumping from 23rd to 12th in 2014. A small number of U.S. universities have been on the decline, however, which has many public universities worried. 'Of the small number of U.S. institutions falling down the list, most are from the public sector and have suffered funding cuts. The prestigious University of California’s top research institutions have collectively suffered and other big name state universities are losing their international status, too,' editor of Times Higher Education rankings Phil Baty told NJ.com. 'This is a worry, as it could lead to a downward spiral, with fewer international scholars wanting to join the institutions. Missed opportunities for global collaboration would lead to further decline.' Top 10: Princeton University in New Jersey ranked 7th on the Times Higher Education rankings . In contrast, Britain's ‘Red brick’ universities are sliding down the global league of the most prestigious places to study. Bristol has followed Leeds and Sheffield in dropping out of a top 100 table which ranks universities according to their reputation around the world. Manchester, meanwhile, slipped out of the top 50. The rankings expose a widening gap between a ‘golden triangle’ of universities in London, Oxford and Cambridge and the rest of UK academia. While each slipping a place to fourth and fifth respectively, Cambridge and Oxford maintain their position in the global elite. London-based institutions including Imperial College, the London School of Economics, University College London and King’s also perform strongly, either maintaining or improving their rankings. But other big name British universities - including the ‘red brick’ institutions established in major industrial cities - have taken a hit and the UK’s representation among the top 100 has shrunk since the table was first published in 2011. Of the rankings of British universities, Baty said: ‘The UK has lost three big-name universities from the list of the world’s 100 most prestigious institutions since the rankings were first published in 2011. 'In 2012, the University of Sheffield exited the rankings, in 2013 the University of Leeds followed suit, and this year the University of Bristol misses out.

Overall, 10 UK universities feature in the World Reputation Rankings top 100, produced by the Times Higher Education magazine - up from nine last year . However, its showing has worsened since 2011 when it had 12 representatives. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University College Union, said: ‘The UK continues to punch above its weight on the global stage, but as other countries invest in their universities and move up global league tables, we risk being overtaken. ‘Other countries recognise the value of their universities and if we do not match their investment we will struggle to maintain our position.’","U.S. universities take up 46 of the 100 top spots .

There were 11 English players on the pitch when Southampton kicked off against Liverpool, and two more came on. What a good advert it was for investing in homegrown talent. Southampton had six Englishmen in their starting XI, and Roy Hodgson has four of them in his England squad. Adam Lallana was the best player on the pitch in the first half and showed great touch and vision, while Luke Shaw proved why he can be England’s left back for years to come. As Liverpool took over Southampton faded but Liverpool’s English contingent then came to the fore. Raheem Sterling is one of the country’s best wingers but came on to play at the point of a midfield diamond. It shows how much Brendan Rodgers works with his young players and improves them. Daniel Sturridge continues to play well and Steven Gerrard was as reliable as ever. Liverpool’s title challenge rolls on and it was satisfying to see two sides playing good football with a core of English players. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Southampton's Luke Shaw mastering free-kicks . Homegrown: Steven Gerrard was one of 11 English players who started at St Mary's . On target: Raheem Sterling scored Liverpool's second goal . Standing out: Saints skipper Adam Lallana was the best player on the pitch in the first half . Spectator: National boss Roy Hodgson was at St Mary's to watch the English players . The League Cup might not be the biggest competition in the world, but that won’t matter one bit to Manuel Pellegrini. When he arrived he was criticised for not winning a major trophy but he has played a strong side throughout, just as Jose Mourinho did in his first season at Chelsea, and now he has one in the bag. They might struggle to get through in the Champions League but who’s to say they can’t go on and win a domestic treble? Maiden: Manuel Pellegrini won his first piece of silverware as Manchester City boss . Stunner: Yaya Toure scored a brilliant goal to equalise at Wembley . It was a good weekend for goals with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri scoring cracking efforts in the cup final. But Christian Benteke’s first goal was one of the best I’ve seen in a long time. It was an important result too for Aston Villa. They have had some problems playing at home this season — sometimes the players seem to freeze up — but it should be a joy. A result like this will get the confidence flowing again. Brilliant: Christian Benteke scored a wonder goal against Norwich . We can’t be sure of what Jose Mourinho did or didn’t say in the dressing room at Fulham but one thing is for certain: it worked. Jose claims he gave his players the silent treatment but Andre Schurrle said his manager had a few words. When I was a player I never had a boss that didn’t say anything at half-time. There were plenty who would chuck things around — my dad liked to throw a sandwich or two at Bournemouth — but it was rarely quiet. Maybe he has just started a new trend? Whatever he did, it had the desired effect. Silent treatment: Jose Mourinho didn't say anything at half-time of Chelsea's win at Fulham . Improved: Drawing 0-0 at half-time, Chelsea went on to win 3-1 thanks to an Andre Schurrle hat-trick . Andre Schurrle is the third German to score a Premier League hat-trick after Fredi Bobic and Jurgen Klinsmann. There has been a lot of talk about Chelsea’s forwards this season but the club has always had good goalscoring midfielders. Frank Lampard has done it for years, Eden Hazard gets his share and Andre Schurrle could join them.  He seemed a bit out of the frame, so I was slightly surprised by his hat-trick, but credit to Mourinho for playing him there. Schurrle is so fast and used that pace to get in behind the Fulham defence. He linked up well with Hazard, no more so than for his first goal, as our graphic below shows. Opener: Schurrle applied a calm finish to a neat team move for the first goal . What Alan Pardew did was one of the most extraordinary things I’ve seen in football. You cannot behave like that and it’s the last thing you would expect from a manager. He is supposed to set the standard and football should do more to try and prevent incidents like this. But let’s not kid ourselves. The game has always had tension bubbling just under the surface. Extraordinary: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew headbutted Hull City's David Meyler . That is no excuse and Pardew deserves to be reprimanded but there are short memories in football. Luis Suarez bit a man last year but has been the player of the season so far. If it goes well on the pitch your problems can be quickly forgiven. Newcastle acted quickly to punish Pardew so it seems they want to keep him. With a ready-made excuse this would have been an easy time to sack him and I feared for Pardew: it’s a lot easier to dismiss a manager than it is to get rid of a player worth £50m. But it looks like the club are standing by their man, for now at least. Fine: Pardew was fined £100,000 by the club for his actions . All credit to Stoke for the way they beat Arsenal. They can add that to impressive home wins over Chelsea and Man United and a good draw with Man City, but it is clear Arsenal are missing Aaron Ramsey. At the start of the season his driving runs and goals took Arsenal to the top of the table and they need him back ASAP. They also miss Theo Walcott’s pace, and it was a shame that he was in the studio with me on Saturday rather than on the pitch working his magic. Missing: Arsenal are missing the drive and goals of Aaron Ramsey (below) Sparkling: Ramsey was in brilliant form earlier this season before he was struck down with injury . When Spurs signed Roberto Soldado I thought they had a real player on their hands. You don’t score the goals he did in La Liga without quality. For whatever reason it’s not quite worked out for him but now he has one I would not be surprised at all if he goes on a scoring run. Relief: Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado scored his first goal of 2014 . Felix Magath might be the first German manager in the Premier League, but there is one in the Championship who has his side flying. Since taking over Uwe Rosler has nine wins in 14 league games with Wigan and has taken them from 15th to sixth. Don’t be surprised if he is the next German managing in the top flight. Struggling: The Premier League's first German manager, Fulham's Felix Magath, is still languishing at the bottom . Flying high: Wigan boss Uwe Rosler has nine wins in 14 since taking over .","The game at St Mary's was a great advert for investing in English talent .

From questionable flings to dodgy piercings, there are few teenagers who haven't made an embarrassing mistake or two. But for Roger, a 32-year-old health and safety inspector, his teenage blooper has had lasting consequences. Aged 15, he got a huge bulldog tattoo in the middle of his chest but when he tried to have it removed, he was left covered in scars - and with remnants of the inking still in place. Gruesome: The pitted and scarred tattoo left on Roger's chest following bungled surgery to remove it . Big mistake: Roger aged 15 with the bulldog tattoo that has proved so troublesome . 'It's been a long process for one mistake that I made,' he explains. 'It's all just one big ball of embarrassment.' His problems began when he decided to get a tattoo of a bulldog in the centre of his chest when he was aged 15 - much to his family's horror. 'I was just horrified,' remembers Roger's mother Marion. 'It didn't do anything to enhance Roger as I knew him.' But worse was to come when, 11 years later, he attempted to have it removed using a silicone solution intended to force the colour out. 'It was almost like re-tattooing,' remembers Roger, 'but it was done in a circular dot form and they injected a silicone solution in there that pushed the tattoo ink out.' The results, however, were not what he'd been hoping for. Instead of a smooth tattoo-free chest, he was left with a collection of lumpy scars - and traces of left-over ink. Thanks to the messy result, Roger was left with his self-esteem in tatters and says he is too embarrassed to take his shirt off in company. 'I've got a daughter,' he adds. 'I want to look forward to holidays where I can lie on beaches with my top off like any normal guy.' Improving: Roger has now had laser surgery to remove the rest of the ink, although the scars remain . Painful: A laser specialist gets to work on the remains of Roger's disfiguring bulldog inking . In a bid to finally rid himself of the disfiguring mess left by the bungled tattoo removal, Roger consulted Extreme Beauty Disaster's dermatologist, Dr Sam Bunting.

A mother came within seconds of aborting her healthy baby after being wrongly told the foetus had died. Hazel Wiggins almost took an abortion pill after being told her baby had died 11 weeks into the pregnancy - and that it would have to be terminated as a result. But today, she is the proud mother of a little girl called Amelia who is thriving. Hazel Wiggins was told to abort Amelia because medics believed she had died 11 weeks into the pregnancy . The events unfolded in August 2013 at Northumberland’s Hexham General Hospital when Ms Wiggins, 36, was 11 weeks into her pregnancy and had an unexpected and heavy bleed. The mother, from Prudhoe, Northumberland, was told her baby had died but refused give up hope. She refused to go ahead with the abortion and instead demanded a second scan. To her amazement, it revealed the baby was alive. Amelia, dubbed a ‘proper little fighter’, was born on January 13, at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary. The community care worker said the first scan she had took place because midwives feared she had had a miscarriage. Mrs Wiggins went to Hexham General Hospital after having a bleed and medics said the baby had no heartbeat. She refused to take the abortion drugs and insisted on another scan which showed Amelia was alive . She said: ‘The midwife looked at my scan for 30 seconds and then said “I’m sorry, there is no heartbeat,” and turned the machine off. ‘I said “Are you sure? You didn’t look at my stomach for very long,” and she said, “Yes, I’m 100 per cent sure”.’ She added: ‘It is the most heart-breaking thing someone can say to you. ‘I went home and just got into bed and mourned the death of the baby. Amelia was born in January with her liver and bowel outside her body but she is improving rapidly in hospital . ‘I let friends and family know. I cried the whole day and night.’ Days later, Mrs Wiggins was back at the hospital to start the first of a series of abortion pills, but deep down she could not accept her baby was dead. ‘They kept saying that I needed to take the tablets and I said that I didn’t want to,’ she said. ‘I told them I wanted another scan. It went on for about 20 minutes.’ Eventually, she persuaded midwives to carry out another scan. ‘I was telling the lady who was scanning me about what had happened when she stopped and looked at me, shocked,” said Mrs Wiggins. ‘She said, “I have a baby here who is jumping all over the place, the baby is alive”.’ The medic then turned the screen to Mrs Wiggins, who is also mother to 10-year-old Dylan. She said: ‘Amelia looked like she was saying to me “Mum, please don’t take the tablets, I’m alive”.’ When an unborn baby has died, the pregnancy tissue is sometimes expelled from the mother's body naturally. If this does not happen, the woman will have to take abortion drugs to encourage the body to remove the dead foetus and the pregnancy tissue. Northumbria NHS Healthcare Foundation Trust has apologised unreservedly for the distress caused to Mrs Wiggins. The case has led to a change in NHS policy on pre-natal scans. The hospital has apologised and changed it's procedure so that all women are offered two scans before being told to abort a foetus that is believed to have died . Now, all expectant mothers who have a . scan which shows their baby has died will be automatically offered a . second scan to make absolutely sure. Mrs . Wiggins, who sought the help of solicitors at Beecham Peacock in . Newcastle to launch a compensation claim against the trust, is relieved . other mothers will not have to endure the same ordeal. When a woman has a miscarriage the pregnancy tissue, including the foetus, is sometimes expelled from her body naturally. If this happens, she will not require treatment. However, if they baby dies but the mother's body does not expel it naturally, she may need treatment. Sometimes a woman can be monitored for about a week in the hope the process will happen naturally. Alternatively, she can be given medication to encourage the cervix to open to allow the tissue to pass out. If the medication is unsuccessful, or there is evidence the pregnancy tissue has become infected, the woman may need surgery to remove it. Source: NHS Choices . Amelia . was born with her liver and bowel on the outside of her body and with . respiratory problems but her health is improving every day. The trust accepted liability for causing distress to the couple and the matter was settled out of court. Dr Eliot Sykes, clinical director of emergency surgery and elective care at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We have recently met with Mrs Wiggins and her husband to apologise wholeheartedly for the unnecessary distress caused following the misinterpretation of her initial scan with us at Hexham General Hospital last year. ‘We have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding this unusual incident and made some important changes to ensure that two scans are always carried out as a matter of course whenever there are concerns about the viability of the foetus. ‘We appreciate this must have been a very worrying time and would like to reassure them that we have taken all appropriate steps to prevent this happening in future.’ Kirsten Scott, senior partner at Beecham Peacock, said: ‘When Hazel was told her baby had died she was understandably devastated. Thanks to her determination and resilience, she saved Amelia’s life. ‘The fact that the policy has now been changed is fantastic news for expectant parents around the country.’","Hazel Wiggins, 36, went to Hexham General Hospital after suffering a bleed .

Twitter can be used to track HIV outbreaks and could one day help prevent them, scientists claim. It may be possible to predict sexual risk and drug use by monitoring tweets and mapping where they come from and comparing them with data on the geographical distribution of HIV cases, according to a new study. A team of U.S. scientists examined almost 10,000 tweets with sexual and drug-related themes and found that their locations were a good predictor for statistics on HIV prevalence. A team of U.S. scientists examined almost 10,000 tweets with sexual and drug-related themes and created a map of them. They found that their locations were a good predictor for statistics on HIV prevalence . Researchers found 8,538 tweets indicating sexually risky behaviour and 1,342 suggesting drug use. The states with the largest proportion of geo-located tweets denoting risky behaviour were California and Texas, which both had over nine per cent of the tweets. New York had almost six per cent and Florida just over five per cent. On a per capita basis, the largest raw number of HIV risk–related tweets came from Columbia, Delaware, Louisiana and South Carolina. ‘Ultimately, these methods suggest that we can use “big data” from social media for remote monitoring and surveillance of HIV risk behaviours and potential outbreaks,’ said Sean Young, co-director of the Centre for Digital Behaviour at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Other studies have examined how Twitter can be used to predict outbreaks of infections like influenza. ‘But this is the first to suggest that Twitter can be used to predict people's health-related behaviours and as a method for monitoring HIV risk behaviours and drug use,’ he said. HIV is mainly spread by people having unprotected sex or sharing drug-use equipment with someone with the HIV virus. Substance use can contribute to these risks indirectly because . alcohol and other drugs can lower people’s inhibitions and make them . less likely to use condoms, Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Researchers collected more than 550 million tweets between May 26 and December 9, 2012 for the study. They then created an algorithm to pick out words and phrases in the tweets suggesting drug use or potentially risky behaviours, such as ‘get high’ and ‘sex’. The study is the first to suggest that Twitter (pictured)can be used to predict people's health-related behaviours and as a method for monitoring HIV risk behaviours and drug use, the researchers said . The scientists plotted tweets identified as risky on a map of the U.S. to discover where they originated and then ran statistical models to see if these were areas where HIV cases had been reported. The algorithm captured 8,538 tweets indicating sexually risky behaviour and 1,342 suggesting drug use. The states with the largest proportion of geo-located tweets denoting risky behaviour were California and Texas, which both had over nine per cent of tweets, New York with almost six per cent and Florida with just over five per cent. On a per capita basis, the largest raw number of HIV risk–related tweets came from Columbia, Delaware, Louisiana and South Carolina. When the researchers linked the tweets to data on HIV cases, they found a ‘significant relationship’ between those indicating risky behaviour and counties where the highest numbers of HIV cases were reported. This map was generated by using social media updates to pinpoint where people were suffering from flu on Christmas day . A Baltimore-based start-up called Sickweather created an influenza map of the U.S. in October 2012 based on people tweeting and posting to Facebook about their illness. The founder of the small firm, Graham Dodge, discovered that social media reports of the flu spiked 77 per cent between August and October - before the flu season was predicted to begin. While an increase in the number of ill people is normal during that time period, the numbers found by Sickweather were 30 per cent up from the previous year. Social media sickness mentions are one of the few signals that can be tracked in real time as doctors attempt to understand how a sickness moves.","Scientists from UCLA examined almost 10,000 tweets with sexual and drug-related themes to map their locations .

Plenty of cheeses get better with age, but crumbs discovered on the necks and chests of Chinese mummies are now thought to be the world’s oldest vintage - although their taste may be questionable. The cheese dates back to 1,615BC and was essentially vacuum-packed with the bodies of the mysterious Bronze Age people who were buried in the Taklamakan Desert, making it the oldest ever recovered. While the strange discovery was made in the 1930s, scientists have only just analysed the proteins and fats in the clumps of 3,600-year-old food to reveal its age and ascertain that it is not butter or milk. Some of the mummies (pictured) were found to have unusual crumbs on their necks and chest which are now known to ancient cheese. They were preserved - complete with their felt hats - die to the dry conditions of their desert burial . Two hundred mummies were discovered in the 1930s by Swedish archaeologist in the Taklimakan Desert north of Tibet. Small River Cemetery was rediscovered in 1934 by Swedish . archaeologist Folke Bergman and then lay forgotten until it was . relocated  using GPS navigation by a Chinese expedition. Archaeologists . began excavating it from 2003 to 2005. The people died around 3,600 years ago but their bodies were preserved because of the air-tight nature of their unusual graves and salty soil. The people had European features with light brown hair and have no name. They were buried in up-turned boats wrapped in animal skin to be air-tight on the top of sand dunes. The mummies are wearing felt caps with feathers, woollen capes and leather boots and were buried with precious objects including woven baskets, carved masks and a medicinal herb, as well as the cheese - which might have been intended for the afterlife. Chemists at Germany's Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics found that the cheese is a lactose-free variety that was quick to make. It might have been responsible for spreading dairy farming across Asia in the Bronze Age, the said. ‘We not only identified the product as the earliest known cheese, but we also have direct evidence of ancient technology,’ analytical chemist and study author Andrej Shevchenko told USA Today. The method of making the cheese was cheap and would have been used by common people, he said. The cheese survived because of the unusual conditions of River Cemetery Number Five in the Takalamn Desert in north western China – the final resting place of the mummies. They and the cheese were laid to rest on sand dunes near a river under large wooden boats wrapped so tightly in cow-hide that the bodies were essentially vacuum-packed. The mixture of dry desert air and salty soil preserved the mummies complete with their light brown hair, felt hats and woollen capes as well as delicate leather boots. Some of the mummies were found to have unusual crumbs on their necks and chest, which are now known to be cheese and not butter or milk. Two hundred mummies were discovered in the 1930s by a Swedish archaeologist in the Taklimakan Desert north of Tibet. The site is known as Small River Cemetery Number 5 (pictured) It is not known why the people were buried with morsels of cheese on them, but much as other civilisations buried their dead with wine and bread, the mummy’s ancestors might have provided them with cheese for the afterlife. Analysis of the cheese shows that it was made by combining milk with a mixture of bacteria and yeast, similar to that used to make kefir, which is quite similar to cottage cheese, today. This is unusual as it is thought that people first stumbled across making cheese by carrying milk in bags made of animal guts, which contained rennet that curdled the milk. As the rennet method of making cheese requires the killing of an animal, Dr Shevchenko thinks the vegetarian kefir method proved easier and cheaper for people at the time. Analysis of the ancient cheese shows that it was made by combining milk with a mixture of bacteria and yeast, similar to that used to make kefir (pictured) which is quite similar to cottage cheese, today . The fact it was so easy and quick meant that it spread the practice of dairy farming across Asia from its origins in the Middle East, according to the study, which will be published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Fragments of cheese-making strainers in Poland, dating back more than 7,000 years, and 5,000-year-old cheese making tools have previously been discovered in Denmark, proving that our ancestors were partial to a morsel of cheese or two, bioarchaeologist Oliver Craig of the University of York told the publication. But no crumbs of ancient cheese as old as that found with the mummies have been recovered. Dr Craig is however not convinced as to whether it is possible to confirm that the cheese was made like kefir as the proteins could have decayed too much to be absolutely sure.","Cheese dates back to 1,615BC and was .

A gadget has been invented to solve the age-old problem of tea and coffee drinkers over-dunking their biscuits and losing them to the bottom of their mug. The small plastic device acts like a reservoir and sits inside a mug, immersed in the drink. It is held in position by a magnet that is attached to the outside of the cup and can be lowered as the user drinks. The drinker dunks their biscuit into the one inch deep holder in the middle of the cup, safe in the knowledge that any biscuit loss is contained in the gadget and is easily recoverable. The Dunkin' Buddy measures 3cm wide and 5.7cm long - the perfect size for most biscuits including Oreos and ginger creams (pictured) as well as digestives, bourbons and cookies . They can even leave the baked snack in the drink-filled holder until it is dunked to their satisfaction or depending on how robust the biscuit is. The invention, called the 'Dunkin' Buddy' takes out the frenetic rush of finding a teaspoon and trying to fish out your biscuit before the hot drink turns it into a sludgy mess. It measures 3cm wide and 5.7cm long - the perfect size for most biscuits including digestives and cookies. The 'Dunkin' Buddy' was invented by Jason Wells, 31, and Kiana Machnicz, 21, both from Connecticut. Mr Wells said: 'We came up with the idea after watching TV and dunking biscuits into our drinks.""The Dunkin' Buddy solves many problems associated with biscuit dunking.

The company said in a blog post: â€˜The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013.â€™ . Tesla is putting $2billion into the project and the remaining costs will be paid for by partners.

Gone are the days when people used to curl up with a steaming cup of cocoa and novel before bedtime. The average person is now more concerned about watching TV and catching up on social networks updates before turning in for the night. New research suggests the average nightly ritual consists of checking social media networks four times, watching 17 minutes of television - and attempting to read a few pages of a book. Just under three quarters of Britons check Twitter or Facebook on a smartphone (pictured) or computer within half an hour of going to bed, with the average person doing so four times . Scientists in the U.S. studied the diets and sleep patterns of more than 4,500 adults and concluded that certain minerals and acids are linked to a sound slumber. Their recent report suggests that a late-night snack of Brazil nuts – which are packed with selenium and potassium – washed down with a calcium-rich glass of milk contains all the ingredients you need for a satisfying sleep. Lead author Dr Michael Grandner of Pennsylvania University, said: 'These findings suggest potentially natural and common-sense solutions to sleep problems. 'Although there is still important work that needs to be done on cause-and-effect, there is a lot of research showing that non-medication approaches can be very helpful. 'Even sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and insomnia can be very effectively treated.’ Experts have previously said that in order to get a good night’s sleep, most people need to unwind for at least half an hour away from technology before trying to get some shut-eye. But the study by Newcastle-based memory foam mattress company Ergoflex found that most Britons are quite active when it comes to bedtime rituals. Over 2,500 men and women from all over the UK were quizzed about how they prepare for bed and the survey revealed that just under three quarters of them check Twitter or Facebook within half an hour of going to bed. More than half of those surveyed watch a TV programme or film, while a similar number – 63 per cent – prepare an outfit for the next day. Just over half of people read a book and a similar number make their bed before climbing into it to sleep. Study participants estimated how long each task took them and the survey revealed that the people who checked for social media updates, did so just over four times in the half an hour before they went to bed, with Facebook the most popular choice. Winding down: Experts have previously said that in order to get good night¿s sleep, most people need to unwind for at least half an hour away from technology before trying to get some shut-eye. The study shows that bedtime rituals such as drinking a cup of cocoa (pictured) are largely a thing of the past . According to the results, 17 minutes was the average amount of time that a person watched TV before going to sleep and three quarters of people who watched TV said they were doing other tasks at the same time. People who laid out outfits for the next day, said it typically took them seven minutes to choose their clothes and of those that tried to read, the average number of pages consumed was just three. Jed MacEwan, Managing Director Ergoflex, said: ‘It was interesting to see that so many Britons have the same nightly ritual in the half an hour leading up to them going to sleep – although we’re a little surprised that the average nightly ritual is so active.' Experts suggest spending time away from technology before sleeping. Just over half of Britons read a book before bed time, but the average person only managed three and a half pages before falling asleep, according to the study . A 2012 study found that using an electronic gadget for just two hours before bed can cause sleep problems. Researchers at the Lighting Research Centre (LRC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute believe displays on phones and computers cause the suppression of melatonin – the chemical that controls the body’s clock. 'Our study shows that a two-hour exposure to light from self-luminous electronic displays can suppress melatonin by about 22 per cent,' said Mariana Figueiro, associate professor at Rensselaer and director of the LRC’s Light and Health Programme. 'Stimulating the human circadian system to this level may affect sleep in those using the devices prior to bedtime,' said Figueiro.","Study by Newcastle-based memory foam .

Dating app Tinder is now matching 5 million people per day,  and users are swiping through 750 million profiles a day, its founder has revealed. Sean Rad, founder and CEO of Tinder, said headshots were a bad idea on the site . Speaking at Upfront Summit in Los Angeles, Rad said Tinder started about a year and half ago because friends realized they were having trouble meeting people. He told the conference 'In the real world we send out signals subconsciously to people if we're interested or not,' 'We wanted to build something that makes that the norm,' he said, according to MarketingLand. 'it's really an analog to what we do in the real world .. it's like the real world but better' Rad also revealed the firm is now approaching a billion matches since it started. When asked what profile's worked best, he also admitted the service was picture-led. 'It's all about the picture,' he said, and claimed the app maker is not ashamed of that.' He advised people to choose their picture carefully. He also advised people to talk about friends and interests they have in common - information they wouldn't have in a 'real world' meeting. On average users open the app seven times a day - with almost a billion matches since it launched 18 months ago . He also admitted headshots were a bad choice. 'Headshots don't work. 'People like to see personality in Tinder photos, they want photos of say you skiing, rather than modeling, that expresses what you actually do.' He also said users on average open the app seven times a day. Rad said the key to success was a profile pic that revealed someone's personality - and to talk about shared friends with a match . Part of the apps recent success has been down to the 'Sochi effect' when athletes in the winter Olympics told of the apps popularity in the athlete's village. Rad told the Wall Street Journal that Tinder saw a 400 percent day-over-day spike in growth during the Sochi Games.

As the cold weather continues to bite, everyone is looking for ways to reduce their heating bills while staying warm. And now an ‘intelligent heating system’ that claims to save people 40 per cent on heating costs could help. Evohome allows users to control their heating room by room using a smartphone app that can even turn the heating on or off if a person forgets to do so in the morning. The Evohome system creates up to 12 'zones' in the home that can be controlled individually to set different temperatures (pictured). For example, someone might want their living room to be cosier than a little-used spare bedroom . The Evohome device could save a homeowner up to 40 per cent on their heating bills, according to Honeywell. However, the system is an investment as the hub itself costs £249. In order to create zones, devices that attach to radiators are needed, which cost £77 each. One room typically constitutes a zone and would need a radiator device in each space. So for a house with four zones, there would be an initial outlay of £529. Someone could use the main device on its own to be able to turn their heating on and off using the app, but to use the 'zone' feature, they would need to invest in the radiator devices. The system creates up to 12 ‘zones’ in the home that can be controlled individually to set different temperatures. For example, someone might want their living room to be cosier than a little-used spare room. Zones can be created by attaching a small device to a radiator in a room that 'talks' to the central hub. The main device even ‘learns’ how a house heats up and cools down so that the system can adapt accordingly. It can react quickly if a window is left open too. Evohome comes with a free app for iPhones and Android smartphones . to control zones in the house and allow users to manage . their heating when they are out. It has pre-programmed actions such as ‘day off’, ‘economy’ or ‘away’ to change heating settings quickly.

The hub on its own allows users to switch their heating on and off remotely using the app, but to use the 'zone' feature, they would need to invest in radiator devices too, which cost £77 each - and one is needed per 'zone' or room. According to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) just over 80 per cent of a typical energy bill is attributed to home heating and hot water to the system gives people a good opportunity to save some money by shutting down the heating if while they are out of the house. ‘In the same way you don’t only have one light switch for your entire house, we believe you shouldn’t control your heating with one single switch.’ said Jeremy Peterson, general manager of of Honeywell’s EMEA Home Comfort and Energy Systems division. Honeywell claims that its Evohome smart device (pictured) can deliver up to 40 per cent of savings, by dividing up a home into zones, instead of heating an entire house in the same way. The device costs £250 and comes in a number of colours . ‘With the right heating controls in place you really can make your home your perfect comfort zone by setting different temperatures for different rooms, at different times,’ he added. ‘With uncertainty surrounding energy bills and wintery conditions across the UK, we believe it [the system] can help households make real savings on energy bills.’ Honeywell customers with older Evohome products can upgrade their system to include radiator zoning kits from April, which will allow them to control heating in different rooms too.

'Every brand has its own design language, so with each client we start from scratch to develop a product that specifically matches the brand and their audience. 'With our expertise, we can provide consumer brand owners with everything they need to have a real advantage when entering the smart device space.' According to industry research company Gartner, most smart watches have not achieved mass-market appeal due to the lack of innovative design. 'Samsung and other well-known vendors have recently entered the smart watch space, yet the products we have seen so far have been rather uninspiring in terms of design, available apps and features,"" said Annette Zimmermann, principal research analyst at Gartner. She believes that mass market smartwatches are still a few years away. 'As a result, Gartner predicts that wearable devices will remain a companion to mobile phones at least through 2017, with less than one percent of premium phone users opting to replace their phone with a combination of a wearable device and a tablet.'

Samsung has unveiled its latest smartwatch which will double up as a TV remote and a fitness tracker as it tries to overcome the problems which plagued its first offering. The Gear 2, and sister device the Gear 2 Neo, will let users track their heart rate while exercising, offer fitness coaching and allow people to design their own workout routines. A built in LED will also let people control other electrical devices, such as their TV. The Samsung Gear 2 (right two watches) and Gear 2 Neo (left three watches) feature a camera built into the watch face, as well as a fitness tracker and LED which allows them to be used as a remote control . Design: The new Gear 2 (left) and Gear 2 Neo (right) come in a range of colours and feature a customisable clock face. The Neo has a slightly bigger display and is also lighter . Simon Stanford, vice president of Samsung UK & Ireland, said: 'Samsung continues to lead in the wearable technology market with innovative, creative devices that are completely integrated into the lives of our customers. 'Offering extended connectivity features, stylish customisation options and a robust application network, we have enhanced everything that people love about the original Samsung Gear to create a second generation of wearable devices that offer unparalleled smart freedom.' The new watch is the latest attempt by a technology firm to tempt buyers into the wearable tech market, which has yet to take off. Samsung's first smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, proved unpopular with customers because of its poor battery life, clunky camera, and limited range of apps . Users were also critical of the fact that, without a constant connection to your phone, the Gear doesn't work . Sales of Samsung's first attempt, the Galaxy Gear, have been disappointing due in part to its poor battery life, clunky camera built into the strap and limited selection of apps. On the new Gear the camera has been moved on to the watch face, but it is unclear what customers will make of other improvements and additional features, such as a range of colours and customisable clock faces. Other companies, such as Pebble, have managed to garner more critical success with their offerings, but that hasn't translated into large sales figures. This latest fan mock-up of the iWatch appeared online as user speculate about the device. Apple has had issues developing the watch meaning the release date has been pushed back . Tech geeks have been creating mock-up ads as they await a release date. Apple reportedly had problems making some components and had to bring in outside help . Sony has just launched its new watch, the Smartwartch 2, which is less expensive and has longer battery life . Apple has reportedly run into number of problems developing its own 'iWatch', including difficulties making components, and has been forced to draft in outside help. The watch is said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, and may also feature Siri voice controls that let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. Part of the problem with wearable technology is the cost of shrinking the computer parts, with Google Glass costing $1,500 (£900) Sony has also just released its new smartwatch, and Google are due to start shipping their offering in March, though that date could be pushed back. Users have remained wary due to the high cost involved with shrinking the technology down, with Samsung's first Gear costing £300.

Asian elephants comfort distressed members of their group with reassuring trunk touches and sounds that could be the equivalent of a human soothing a baby, scientists have revealed. It is the first clear evidence of elephants displaying 'consolation' behaviour, previously only demonstrated in great apes, dogs and some crow species. Scientists spent a year watching a group of 26 captive Asian elephants at a camp in northern Thailand. Fancy a hug? Researchers found that in the elephant world, tapping another animal with the trunk is a way to comfort them - and the equivalent of a hug in humans . The researchers recorded instances when one of the animals was distressed or frightened, for example by a snake rustling in the grass, a passing dog, or an unfriendly elephant. Typically, when this happened a nearby elephant would walk over and gently touch its upset colleague with its trunk, or put its trunk in the other animal’s mouth. The 'trunk in the mouth' gesture is the elephant equivalent of a handshake or hug, according to lead scientist Joshua Plotnik, from Mahidol University in Thailand. 'It’s a very vulnerable position to put yourself in, because you could get bitten,' said Dr Plotnik, who is chief executive of the non-profit conservation organisation Think Elephants International. 'It may be sending a signal of ‘I’m here to help you, not hurt you’. Supportive elephants also tended to vocalise, often producing a high chirping sound. 'I’ve never heard that vocalisation when elephants are alone,' Dr Plotnik said. 'It may be a signal like, ‘Shhh, it’s OK’, the sort of sounds a human adult might make to reassure a baby.' Reassuring: If an animal was alarmed, a nearby elephant would walk over and gently touch its upset colleague with its trunk, or put its trunk in the other animal¿s mouth, the researchers found. In addition, elephants responded to distress signals of other group members by displaying similar emotional signals - a likely sign of empathy. Groups of nearby elephants were also more likely to bunch together and make physical contact. Dr Plotnik compared them to humans watching a scary movie moving closer to each other and holding hands. Professor Frans de Waal, from Emory University in Georgia, US, who took part in the research reported in the online journal PeerJ, said: 'With their strong social bonds, it’s not surprising that elephants show concern for others. 'This study demonstrates that elephants get distressed when they see others in distress, reaching out to calm them down, not unlike the way chimpanzees or humans embrace someone who is upset.' The key to consolation behaviour is empathy - the ability to put yourself emotionally into another individual’s shoes, said Dr Plotnik. This requires complex thinking, which is why it is so rarely seen in animals, he believes. In contrast, 'reconciliation' behaviour that provides a way to repair broken relationships in social groups has been seen in many more species. Dr Plotnik and Prof de Waal previously conducted research showing that elephants can recognise themselves in mirrors and co-operate to solve problems. 'Humans are unique in many ways, but not in as many ways as we once thought,' Dr Plotnik added.","Scientists spent a year watching a group of 26 captive Asian elephants .

Hannah Foxley, a two-time breast cancer survivor, has just been diagnosed with cancer for the third time in three years. The 35-year-old - who inspired millions of women when she posed naked in Cosmopolitan magazine following her mastectomy - thought she was finally in the clear until she received the devastating news two weeks ago. 'To go from believing that I was fighting fit and healthy to now realising that I am in a lot of trouble is a huge shock and something that I am struggling to come to terms with,' she told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Shattering: Hannah Foxley, posing in Comsopolitan magazine following her mastectomy, has been diagnosed . with cancer for the third time in three years . Hannah said her world turned upside down when she found a lump in her breast in April 2011. 'It was like being hit by a train. It didn’t feel real. Like most young women, I thought I was invincible,' she said. She had a lumpectomy and eight cycles of gruelling chemotherapy. Then, a week before her treatment was due to end, she found a second cancerous lump. She had a mastectomy, followed by five weeks of radiotherapy. The treatment was successful, however, she was rushed into hospital last Monday with severe abdominal pain and remained in excruciating pain for the rest of the week. Tests showed that she has advanced stage liver cancer and that it has spread to her lung. Fight: After believing she was finally in the clear, Hannah was rushed into hospital last week and discovered the cancer hadn't gone away at all . 'It turns out that the cancer spread in the first place but it was never picked up and it has been growing ever since. So while I have been working to inspire others, all the time the cancer was taking over my liver,' she said. Hannah started chemo on Thursday and says she is 'up for the fight'. She has already changed to a plant-based diet, which provides an alkaline environment which some say helps in the fight against cancer. She said: 'I started chemo last week and my Oncologist has told me that I do not have the luxury of time to explore other options, I must start immediately. 'The cancer is inoperable as it has spread too far and radiotherapy is not an option. I have therefore begun exploring how I can heal naturally alongside the chemo. 'One of the key factors in healing is diet. I need to get my body into an alkaline state as quickly as possible and the way to do this is a plant-based diet. Support: Hannah, who ploughed all of her resources into her business, is crowfunding to help her pay for her treatment . 'I have read many stories of people who have survived cancer by switching to a plant-based diet and I have done this immediately. It is a big change and I have to completely re-learn how to provide my body with all of the nutrients it needs. 'The other form of healing is emotional. This is also key as many serious illnesses can stem from toxic emotions that we have not been able to express. This is true for me. So I am on a journey of healing both naturally and with conventional medicine.' Hannah has made the decision to try treatment in an American clinic where they use homeopathic remedies. However she doesn’t have the funds necessary after pouring her savings into a fledgling company two years ago. 'What I really need is financial . support. I started my fledgling business 18 months ago and ploughed all . of my resources into that. I now have nothing to help me through this,' she said. Documenting her journey: Hannah has been photographed immediately post mastectomy, left, and coming to terms with it, right . First fight: These images aim to capture the loneliness of cancer treatment, left, and being told the cancer had come back, right . So in an unusual move, Hannah is crowdfunding online to pay for her treatments. Explaining . her decision, she said: 'The biggest worry for me is financial . security. After my second bout of cancer, I decided to leave my job and . set up my business, The Women's Wealth Expert, a fee based financial . planning business that specialises in working with divorced and . divorcing women. 'I ploughed all of my resources into getting the business set up and now find myself with no financial back up at all. 'In . order to give myself the best possible chance of healing and . surviving this, I need to be able to pay for treatment, which is not . available on the NHS as my options are so limited. I also need to be . able to keep the roof over my head, which is the biggest fear. 'In . order to cover my basic needs and pay for the . treatment that I need to survive, I have set up a crowd funding page on . GoFundMe. Touching: Hannah can be seen being comforted by her mother . as she comes to term with, what she describes as, 'losing a key part of . her femininity' 'I have already . had an overwhelming response but am asking for people to donate . something, no matter how large or small to help me recover. 'Any . donations from companies for organic vegetables, or anything else that will . help me with my plant-based diet are gratefully received. 'If . I do not survive this, or if I do and do not need all of the money, I . will pay it forward by donating it to someone else who is in my position, . or I will donate it to Breakthrough Breast Cancer as I am an ambassador . for them.' Fighting on: This image, titled 'looking grey and very ill and fed up of being pumped full of drugs', captures Hannah during her chemo . Beauty: 'Beauty beyond scars' shows the scars of the first lot of operations. This image was used on a PhD thesis on breast cancer, left, and, right, shows the scars of losing her breast . Hannah wants to raise £25,000 and it seems that her story has touched the nation - in . just over a week she has raised more than £14,000. Today, her funds stand at £16,000. Keeping her supporters updated, she writes: 'Thanks to your generosity, I have today been able to pay for my first round of functional testing and a block of appointments with my homeopathic doctor. 'I have also been able to pay for a block of sessions to work on my emotional issues as well as pay for all of the nutrients and food that I require to start to repair my body. 'All of this costs thousands of pounds and I just could not have done it without your help. Thank you so much for helping me with this journey.' While . she has never met them, an American financial expert has donated £120 . with the message: 'After browsing your website it appears we have much . in common.

Chris Christie has lost 100 lbs since last year, deeming his weight-loss surgery a success, experts have said. The 5 ft 11 New Jersey Governor underwent lap-band surgery in February 2013 and has since slimmed down to an estimated 320 lbs - losing anywhere between 90 and 100 lbs. While the politician may still appear portly, a top bariatric-surgery expert said his mega loss means his surgery has been a success, despite speculation that his weight loss has slowed. 'We're trying to get somebody into a . healthy lifestyle and reduce their obesity-related conditions,' Dr. Ninh T. Nguyen, president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, told NBC. Slimmed down: Chris Christie is pictured left ahead of his lap band surgery in February 2013 and right in January. Experts say they believe he has lost between 40 and 45 per cent of his excess body weight . 'We're not trying to make somebody skinny here.' Nguyen said he predicts Christie has lost 40 per cent to 45 per cent of his excess weight in the first year, which is expected for someone after being fitted with a lap band. 'From the images I saw, I would say, yes, I would regard it as successful,' Nguyen said. Dr. Thomas Inge, a bariatric expert at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, agreed it had been a success, and commended Christie for keeping off the weight despite his professional pressures. 'With everything the man is dealing with, it is a wonder he has done so well,' Inge told NBC News. Christie, who has been embroiled in the bridge closing scandal in recent weeks, has remained largely quiet about the weight loss, although he did reveal in September that he is more than halfway to his goal. Before: An image taken in November 2012 shows Christie with his daughter Bridget ahead of the surgery .

'It has nothing to do the performance of my job,' he told People magazine last May. He added to the magazine that his life felt drastically different since he underwent the surgery on February 16.

'This seems... to be getting at the root of the problem, which . is that I was hungry all the time,' he said. 'I'm not nearly as interested in food as I used to be. But Christie added that he was wary of getting too excited about the amount of weight he has lost. 'I've had past success that has lapsed back,' he said.

"By . Luke Garratt . PUBLISHED: . 17:34 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:51 EST, 6 March 2014 . The 'foodie' revolution is helping the independent food shops that were once waning on British high streets, with food shops like butchers and bakers rising in numbers by 27 per cent. New research has revealed that the British town centre has seen a 31 per cent rise year on year in the number of bakers, and a 28 per cent rise in the number of fishmongers, who have moved into the previously empty high street. Experts have also partly attributed the 27 per cent rise to the backlash against supermarkets following the horse meat scandal last year. Butcher shops are one of the many types of food stores that have been revitalised by a combination of recent foodie crazes and supermarket criticism . An insurance group analysed over 40,000 retail outlets between 2012 and 2013 and recorded a 27 per cent rise in the number occupied by independent food and drink traders. Having previously had their sales numbers hit by the discounts offered by huge supermarket chains, many now find shoppers prefer to pay more to guarantee quality. The horsemeat scandal a year ago and an improving economy has encouraged some consumers to no longer simply buy the cheapest food and drink available. Traders are also taking advantage of local and national government schemes to revitalise town centres, such as relaxed parking restrictions or rate cuts. British high street food stores like grocers and fishmongers have been going slightly empty in the last couple of years due to the intense competition from big name supermarkets that smaller stores cannot compete with (pictured: Solihull high street, West Midlands) The biggest rise has been a 65 per cent rise in the number of independent supermarkets in High Streets, such as smaller grocers not owned by supermarket chains like Tesco or Sainsbury's. Independent supermarket - up 65% . General food store - up 32% . Bakery - up 31% . Fishmonger - up 28% . Delicatessen - up 25% . Greengrocer - 24% . Wine merchant - up 10% . Butcher - up 9% . This is followed by a 32 per cent rise in smaller food and drink retailers such as the traditional corner shop and a 25 per cent increase in delicatessens, it added. It has helped reduce the number of empty shops in High Streets to a three year low by the end of 2013, said Simply Business which specialises in small and medium sized companies. Simply Business chief Jason Stockwood said: 'The surge in independent food merchants exemplifies the nimble nature of small businesses as their success is often determined by smartly tapping into growing trends at the right time. 'We hope these independent food and drink stores will profit from consumers turning their backs on established supermarket chains in favour of their local providers who breath new life into community high streets. 'Independent businesses are vital to the ongoing growth of the UK economy and our findings reinforce this.","Discerning shoppers have helped revitalise the British high street .

A trial date for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was set for November 3 at a hearing on Wednesday, despite objections from his attorneys. The date is nearly a year earlier than the team representing the 20-year-old had requested, as they argued for more time to build a defense. Tsarnaev, who has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal counts including one involving a weapon of mass destruction, could face the death penalty if convicted of the attack in April last year, which killed three people. The suspected bomber did not appear at the hearing, but several of the 260 people injured in the attack, including Marc Fucarile, did attend. Prosecutors allege that Tsarnaev and . his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, built and planted two pressure cooker . bombs near the finish line of the marathon last April. Tamerlan Tsarnaev . died following a shootout with police several days later. Prosecutors had pushed for an earlier trial date, and U.S. District Judge George O'Toole said the proposed date was 'realistic and fair'. The defense had asked for the trial to take place no earlier than September 2015. Mr Fucarile, who lost his right leg above the knee in the attack, said he wished the trial would start even earlier. 'Why not?' he said. 'Everybody should be on the same page … It’s pretty cut and dried with the evidence. Don’t waste anybody’s time.' Accused: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured second left in an image taken about 20 minutes before the balst, and his brother Tamerlan, third from left, were named as suspects in the Boston Marathon attack . Manhunt: Tsarnaev pictured climbing over a boat during his arrest on April 19 . Defense attorney Judy Clarke, one of the country’s leading death penalty specialists, complained that prosecutors have been 'sluggish' in turning over evidence to her team. In particular, she cited 2,000 pieces of physical evidence at an FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, that the defense hasn’t been able to examine yet. 'It’s not the defense dragging its feet. We’re really struggling with getting access to evidence,' she said. Ms Clarke said it was doubtful the defense could get experts to review the items before this summer, which would make a November trial date 'virtually impossible'. She said the defense has a 'tremendous amount' of work to do to compile information on Tsarnaev’s family history. Quick hearing: Boston Marathon bombing victim Marc Fucarile wants the trial to take place as soon as possible . The family lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and came to the U.S. about a decade ago from the Dagestan region of Russia. 'There’s just a tremendous amount of logistical hurdles,' she said. Judge O’Toole did not agree to change the trial date, but he did order prosecutors to compile a list of the items in Quantico for Tsarnaev’s lawyers by the end of the week. The judge scheduled another court hearing for June 18.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev could face death penalty if convicted of terror attack .

The SAT college entrance exam is undergoing sweeping revisions. Changes in the annual test that millions of students take will also do away with some vocabulary words such as 'prevaricator' and 'sagacious' in favor of words more commonly used in school and on the job. College Board officials said Wednesday the update â€” the first since 2005 â€” is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward. The test should offer 'worthy challenges, not artificial obstacles,' said College Board President David Coleman at an announcement event in Austin, Texas. Scroll down for video . New rules: Changes to SATs were announced today which College Board officials hope will make tests more relevant to the working world . The new exam will be rolled out in 2016, so this year's ninth graders will be the first to take it, in their junior year. The new SAT will continue to test reading, writing and math skills, with an emphasis on analysis. Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale last used in 2004, with a separate score for the optional essay. For the first time, students will have the option of taking the test on computers. One of the biggest changes is that the extra penalty for wrong answers, which discouraged guessing, will be eliminated. And some vocabulary words will be replaced with words such as ""synthesis"" and 'empirical' that are used more widely in classrooms and in work settings. Coleman said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of SAT words currently have one recourse:  drilling with flashcards. He said educators know that flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts, but 'when the SAT rolls around they become the royal road. Students stop reading and start flipping.' The essay will be changed in other ways, too. It will measure students' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument, instead of measuring the coherence of the writing but not the quality or accuracy of the reasoning. It will be up to school districts and colleges the students apply to as to whether the essay will be required. Each exam will include a passage drawn from 'founding documents' such as the Declaration of Independence or from discussions they've inspired. New measurement: Essays will no longer be compulsory and wrong answers will not be penalized in the exams . Instead of testing a wide range of math concepts, the new exam will focus on a few areas, like algebra, deemed most needed for college and life afterward. A calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions, instead of on the entire math portion. A longstanding criticism of the SAT is that students from wealthier households do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes. The College Board seeks to defuse that by saying it will partner with the nonprofit Khan Academy to provide free test preparation materials for the redesigned SAT. It also says every income-eligible student who takes the SAT will receive four fee waivers to apply for college, which continues an effort the College Board has had to assist low-income students. These are the first SAT upgrades since 2005 when the essay portion was added and analogy questions were removed. There have been other notable changes to the test, such as in 1994 when antonym questions were removed and calculators were allowed for the first time. The test was first used in 1926. The SAT was taken last year by 1.7 million students. It has historically been more popular on the coasts, while the other popular standardized college entrance exam, the ACT, dominated the central U.S. But the ACT overtook the SAT in overall use in 2012, in part because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of the states' testing regimen. Last year, the ACT said it would begin offering computer-based testing in 2015.","College Board outlined changes to the examinations today .

Five-year-old Miles Scott made headlines in October when the Make-A-Wish foundation let him be a superhero for a day. He was set to appear at the Academy Awards on Sunday but his segment was cancelled last minute . Where was he? Spider-man star Andrew Garfield was . supposed to be in a segment with Miles, but skipped the ceremony last . minute. One source told the New York Post that the actor backed out because he didn't like his lines . The Academy Awards took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday night and were hosted by Ellen DeGeneres . The boy's family traveled down to Los Angeles from their home in Northern California on relatively short notice to participate in the awards ceremony. Miles even rehearsed with Garfield for the ceremony in front of a Gotham backdrop that had the name 'Batkid' in big letters on Saturday. The source told the Post that it was in the middle of rehearsals that Garfield decided 'he didn't like his lines'. 'Garfield refused to go by the script. He came up with his own lines. The producers felt that Garfield’s [rewrites] were not appropriate. Garfield had a tantrum. He stormed off. 'Garfield was such a spoiled brat that he didn’t even want to be a presenter,' the source said. Early Sunday morning, Miles' family was notified that the segment had been cut without explanation. 'I don’t know if they ran out of time, or if there was something about the segment they didn’t like,' Miles' mom Natalie Scott told the International Business Times. 'It got pulled so quickly that we didn’t have a lot of insight into what was going on.' The happiest place on Earth: After the segment was cancelled, The Academy Awards paid for the Scott family to go to Disneyland.

As consolation, the family was treated to a trip to Disneyland, paid for by the Academy Awards, and that's how Miles spent Sunday and Monday. While the Academy offered no explanation to the family, it seems actor Andrew Garfield's disappearance may have played a role in the change of program. 'Things happen': Miles mom Natalie says her son was disappointed he didn't get to wear his fancy tux, but that they made the most of the situation . In addition to rumors of creative differences, a source speculated to Radar that Garfield's disappearance was a serious family issue, either at home in England or with girlfriend Emma Stone's family in Arizona. 'If it were a fight or something between [Andrew and Emma] one would have just came without the other, but this seemed to be more of something going on with one of their families.

Sick plans: Former high school librarian Christopher Asch  is being accused of plotting to torture, rape and murder women and children . When federal authorities nabbed an NYPD cop plotting to kill, cook and eat women two years ago, they opened up a dark underground full of men planning to do just the same thing. Christopher Asch, the 62-year-old former librarian of Manhattan's prestigious Stuyvesant High School, was arrested in the course of the investigation into 'cannibal cop' Gilberto Valle and is now facing charges of his own. Prosecutors say Asch and another man, Richard Meltz, offered to help 23-year-old Michael Van Hise rape and murder Van Hise's wife, sister-in-law and sister-in-law's kids. In federal court on Wednesday, FBI . Agent Jason Floyd described some of the evidence they found in a search . of Asch's Greenwcih Village home - including a 'very extreme' S&M . pornographic film which they believe Asch watched to prepare for the . murder. Federal . agents initially planned to show screengrabs of 'Pain 35' - a . pronographic video which Asch had two copies of -  to the jury, but none . were shown in court on Wednesday. So . Floyd described the video, saying it depicts two men torturing women . who 'appeared to be consenting' with nipple clamps, leg spreaders, a . riding crop, handcuffs, rope and needles inserted into one of the . woman's buttocks, breast and genitals. Manhattan . federal Judge Paul Gardephe told the jury he watched the video before . allowing it entered into evidence and described it as 'very disturbing'. Cannibal cop connections: Authorities found out about Asch's plan while investigating Gilberto Valle, a NYPD officer who had plans of his own to kill and eat up to 100 women. Valle was convicted last year . Jurors cringed as Floyd continued to . describe the torture, saying the women had clamps with 'small metal . teeth' attached to their vaginas 'with weights attached to the clamps', . the New York Post reported. Asch's . defense lawyer Brian Waller said the video was just a form of S&M . festish, and the plot was just a fantasy the librarian never planned to . carry out in real life. But Agent Floyd responded that it wasn't any run-of-the-mill fetish video, but 'a very extreme form' of S&M. Asch and cohort Richard Meltz met Van Hise on festish site Dark Fetish, a favorite of cannibal-cop Valle. In . 2012 Van Hise, of New Jersey approached Asch and Meltz for help with . the plot to rape and murder his wife, sister-in-law and sister-in-law's . children. Working together: Prosecutors say Asch worked with Richard Meltz (left) to help Michael Van Hise (right) when the 23-year-old asked the two men with help raping and killing his wife, sister-in-law and sister-in-law's children . NBC New York reported that the FBI . came into contact with Asch when he responded to an online ad where . someone had posted that they wanted help kidnapping, raping and kill his . wife, sister-in-law and the sister-in-law's children. The ad was posted in October 2012 and Asch met with undercover FBI agents to discuss a similar plot in recent months. At . two of the meetings, he brought items that he reportedly thought would . be useful including a taser, a black ski mask, handcuffs, a hammer, . pliers and forceps. The . agents set it up so that Asch conducted surveillance on a woman- not . knowing that she was also a member of the undercover operation. During one conversation with another meeting with agents, Asch reportedly said the female target 'had to die'. Asch was the one who brought Meltz into the operation, saying that he wanted to help with the kidnapping of the woman. 'This is a fairly high-risk operation,' Asch said in a recorded conversation with Meltz. 'Trying to snatch somebody off the street, home invasion, I think they're pretty high-risk. 'I mean, there are ways to dismember and dispose.' If convicted, Asch and Van Hise face life in prison. Meltz took a plea deal in January.","Federal prosecutors say 62-year-old Christopher Asch plotted to torture, rape and kill two women and one of the woman's children .

The Government was accused of caring more about ‘bean-counting than national security’ after it emerged the Ministry of Defence employs more accountants than senior Army officers. Figures show the MoD has 2,490 civilian staff working in the ‘Finance Job Family’, compared with 2,300 senior officers. These include generals, lieutenant generals, major generals, brigadiers and colonels put together. The Ministry of Defence employs more accountants than senior Army officers, figures reveal . The number of accountants at the ministry has sparked outrage at a time when thousands of frontline servicemen are being axed amid crippling military cuts. The MoD, in the midst of one of the toughest cost-cutting drives in its history, is axing 30,000 troops, fleets of warships, warplanes and armoured vehicles to save £4.7billion and plug a £42billion black hole in its equipment budget. Some 25,000 civil servants are also losing their jobs. Shadow defence spokesman Kevan Jones, who uncovered the statistics, said: ‘It sums up Defence Secretary Philip Hammond that the Ministry of Defence has more accountants than senior Army officers. 'Hammond cares more about bean-counting than defence': Shadow defence spokesman Kevan Jones who uncovered the shocking figures . ‘These figures confirm suspicions that he cares more about bean-counting than he does about defence and UK national security.’ Commander John Muxworthy, a Falklands veteran who is chief executive of the UK National Defence Association – which campaigns to ensure the Armed Forces have the right equipment – said: ‘This seems to be excessive. There is a complete imbalance within the MoD. To have so many accountants at a time when the numbers of officers and other ranks are being decimated seems astonishing.’ Mr Jones has also learned that 820 military number-crunchers axed in the past three years have been paid £23million in compensation. Around £2.8million was then spent on external accountants. Mr Jones said: ‘Millions have already been wasted on botched procurement reform and a failed IT project, and the public will be justifiably angry at yet another example of incompetence on Philip Hammond’s watch as Defence Secretary.’ The MoD insists it needed them to deal with complex contracts. Yet the huge arsenal of financial expertise has still seen the MoD hit by a series of damaging blunders and accusations of waste. A withering National Audit Office report earlier this year found the cost of Britain’s biggest military programmes are £6.1billion over budget because wasteful defence chiefs have failed to live within their means. Defence minister Anna Soubry said: ‘The figures need to be seen in the context of the tough financial decisions made by  this Government. ‘We estimate that by 2021-22 we will have achieved cumulative savings of some £23billion as a result of reductions in service and civilian personnel and greater efficiency in the conduct of non-frontline activities.’ A spokesman for the MoD said: 'Since 2010, we've cut the number of civilian finance staff by a quarter at the same time as balancing the budget and eliminating the £38 billion black hole in the Defence budget inherited from the previous administration. 'MoD finance staff make up just one per cent of our workforce, but the idea that we don’t need them to manage a £34billion a year budget, some of the most complex procurement projects in the country, and the smooth-running of the MoD’s bases and locations around the world is absurd.'","MoD in the midst of massive cost cutting drive, including axing 30,000 troops .

Johnny Junior was put to sleep by vets at Yorkshire Wildlife Park yesterday after he was injured during a fight with other lions, including four females. Despite staff intervening in the fight, 16-year-old Johnny was too injured to survive. He was living in Pride 2 at the park alongside lionesses Carla, Frida, Julie and Crystal. Scroll down for video . Johnny Junior was saved from squalid conditions in a Romanian zoo before being mauled to death by other big cats at Yorkshire Wildlife Park . The lion (not pictured) was put down by vets yesterday after being injured in the fight at the park (pictured) Johnny was one of the 13 lions whose . plight was highlighted in a campaign to rescue them from appalling . conditions in run down Oradea Zoo in Romania. The . story of the lions moved thousands of people to donate over £150,000 to . bring Johnny and 12 other lions back to the purpose built Lion Country . at Yorkshire Wildlife Park. The . 13 lions arrived at the Park in 2010 and were slowly rehabilitated into . their new home under much veterinary care and careful husbandry by . staff. A spokesman at Yorkshire Wildlife Park said: ‘Without any prior warning, the pride which included four females, had a fight in which Johnny was injured. ‘Staff managed to separate the other lions within minutes of the fight starting and called them into the house, where the vet attended Johnny. ‘Unfortunately, his injuries were such that there was no option but for him to be put to sleep. ‘This was extremely distressing for the staff who have cared for 16 year old Johnny since he arrived in the UK in 2010 and especially as the whole episode was completely unprecedented and out of character for the pride.’ Despite staff at the park intervening in the fight, 16-year-old Johnny Junior was too injured to survive . Johnny (not pictured) was one of the 13 lions whose plight was highlighted in a campaign to rescue them from appalling conditions in run down Oradea Zoo in Romania . The lions regained their health and strength and enjoyed life in Lion Country, and thousands of people have been to see them. The spokesman added: ‘Yorkshire Wildlife Pak announces with great sadness that Johnny Junior, one of the famous lions rescued from Romania, has died. ‘The directors of Yorkshire Wildlife Park would like to thank the veterinary teams from Portland House Veterinary Group from Retford who responded so quickly to this unexpected event and who have worked and supported staff to help improve the health of Johnny and the other lions since their arrival. ‘The Park would also like to thank the dedicated staff team who have loved and cared for Johnny since his arrival and who today are shocked at the sudden loss of one who was a favourite at the Park for staff and visitors alike.’ Johnny Junior is the third of the lions to die since his arrival in the UK. Johnny Senior died in June 2012 while Cezar died in January of this year. There are ten remaining lions at the park. This photograph shows one of the lions being rescued from the Romanian zoo in 2010 . Johnny Junior was in Pride 2 at the Yorkshire park alongside Carla, Frida, Julie and Crystal . The death of Johnny Junior will inevitably conjure up memories of fellow wild animal Marius, a giraffe killed, chopped up and fed to lions last month at Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark. Despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save the two-year-old animal, staff went ahead and shot Marius with a bolt pistol. The Danish zoo said the drastic move, a killing witnessed by watching schoolchildren, was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational. Last month, Marius the giraffe was killed, chopped up and fed to lions at Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark . Keepers shot the infant with a bolt gun before dissecting his body in front of a crowd including children . But animal rights campaigners condemned the killing of Marius, saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in Europe’s top zoos. Marius’s plight had triggered worldwide outpourings of protest, including an offer to rehome him in Britain, with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a healthy animal. Despite protestations, the zoo announced Marius had been killed with a bolt gun instead of a lethal injection, which would have contaminated the flesh. His carcass was then skinned and chopped up while visitors crowded around and the meat was fed to the lion population. After the autopsy Marius was fed to the lions, with staff calling the procedure part of the 'circle of life' On the same day, Longleat Safari Park admitted it put down two lions and four cubs. The Wiltshire park said it had too many lions and they were growing violent. But visitors asked why new homes were not found.","Johnny Junior was put to sleep by vets at Yorkshire Wildlife Park after fight .

The culture of lavish bonuses for bankers is back in full swing, after Barclays and Lloyds revealed that 500 staff pocketed more than £1million last year. Critics accused the banks of a  ‘disgraceful act of greed and betrayal’ and urged Chancellor George Osborne to intervene. The revelations came as both High Street lenders published their annual reports. Lavish bonus: Lloyds Banking Group boss Antonio Horta-Osorio, who looks likely to sidestep new EU banking rules put in place after the financial crisis, pictured left and right with his wife Ana . State-backed Lloyds confirmed its boss Antonio Horta-Osorio received £4.5million in pay and perks last year, while Barclays revealed it has lined up 1,000 senior staff for ‘role-based’ allowances to avoid a bonus cap from Brussels. Other details include: . Banks have repeatedly vowed to show restraint on pay. Just last month Barclays chief Antony Jenkins promised his bank understood public outrage, saying: ‘There will be no going back to the old way of doing things. We get it.’ But critics said Mr Jenkins’ comments were at odds with the reality, which saw Barclays pay 481 people more than £1million last year, up from 428 in 2012. Mr Jenkins claimed the bank needed to pay big bonuses to avoid a ‘death spiral’ of top investment bankers leaving to join rivals. Questions unanswered: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected to face a grilling . But critics pointed out that Barclays’ top talent steered the bank to a 32 per cent fall in profits to £5.2billion last year. Despite this the High Street giant saw fit to hike its bonuses to £2.4billion, with its ‘casino bankers’ receiving £60,100 on average. Last night the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee of MPs blasted the failure of UK banks to show restraint, more than six years after the onset of the financial crisis. Tory MP Andrew Tyrie said: ‘It is regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need for fundamental reform in this year’s bonus round.’ ‘The new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed,’ he added. Rob MacGregor, of union Unite, said: ‘This is a disgraceful act of greed and betrayal by these brass-necked bankers. Lloyds Banking Group recently announced that it will set-aside 1.8 billion Pounds (2.1 billion Euros) for claims of mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) ‘George Osborne now has a duty to the . people of this country to step in and act to curb the continued excesses . of the banking elite.’ A . spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which lobbies for a tax on . financial transactions, said: ‘Instead of fighting to protect the . grotesque pay levels of their friends in the City, the Government should . be reining the sector in and ensuring it contributes more to society.’ Both .

In . total around 1,000 top earners at Barclays will also receive generous . ‘role-based’ payments in cash and shares, to supplement their basic . incomes. Mr Jenkins is in line for a £950,000 shares windfall on top of his £1.1milion basic salary and £363,000 pension. Although the maximum amount he can receive falls, it means he is now guaranteed to receive more than £2.4million every year. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC Group CEO has also sidestepped EU rules, and is expected to be worth around £7.5 million after being given bonuses on top of his £1.25 million basic salary . Similarly, .

The Cabinet Secretary has been asked to investigate a string of unanswered questions over Downing Street’s handling of the child porn arrest and resignation of one of David Cameron’s closest aides. Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Minister, Jon Ashworth, asked Sir Jeremy Heywood whether aide Patrick Rock was given advance notice that police were being called in. He also demanded to know if it was right for a previous complaint against Mr Rock to be handled by the Prime Minister’s chief of  staff Ed Llewellyn – a friend of both Mr  Cameron and Mr Rock. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood (left) has been asked by Labour to investigate why the child porn arrest of Patrick Rock (right) was not made public . Downing Street has been accused of a cover-up after Mr Rock, deputy director of the  No 10 policy unit, was arrested over suspected child pornography offences on February 13. No 10 failed to disclose that he had resigned until confronted by the Daily Mail earlier this week. Mr Cameron’s aides insist it would be been wrong to have made the affair public before the police, though the National Crime Agency, which was called in to Downing Street, is still refusing to comment. Labour MPs suggest No 10 has failed to satisfy ‘a number of important questions’, including the sequence of events that saw Mr Rock resign before being arrested early the next day. In a letter to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, Mr Ashworth asked when Downing Street was first made aware of the allegations, at what point Mr Rock was spoken to, when police were alerted and precisely when Mr Rock resigned. It also emerged that Mr Rock, 62, who has been close to Mr Cameron for decades since they worked together as young advisers at the Home Office, had previously been accused of sexual harassment by a woman civil servant. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he is 'profoundly shocked' by the arrest of his old friend . The complaint was made to Ed . Llewellyn, Mr Cameron’s chief of staff, and it is understood that the . Prime Minister was also informed. Downing Street sources say the complaint was in no way related to the allegations involving child abuse images and had been ‘appropriately settled’. The move of the complainant to another Government department was also unconnected to the incident, they insist. Mr Ashworth asked Sir Jeremy exactly how much Mr Cameron had known of the previous complaint, and whether it was right for it to be handled by Mr Llewellyn, given his friendship with Mr Rock. The two men both worked for Lord Patten, now head of the BBC, when he was a Brussels commissioner. Mr Ashworth said: ‘I understand that Downing Street has a duty of care to Mr Rock. However, there seems to be a number of very basic and serious questions which need answering because he was a very senior figure in Cameron’s office.’ Questions: There are several aspects of the case which have been left unanswered by Number 10 . Downing Street said Sir Jeremy would respond in due course but that it was satisfied the previous grievance and the arrest and resignation had been properly handled. However it added that it could not answer some of the questions because of the potential for prejudicing an ongoing investigation. Mr Rock was brought in to Downing Street as deputy head of policy in 2011, and was involved in drawing up Government policy on tackling online child abuse images. Mr Cameron said he was ‘profoundly shocked’ by the allegations. Mr Rock, who is unmarried and lives in west London, has not been charged with any offence and has not commented on his arrest.

A government scheme which helps first-time buyers to get onto the housing ladder buying homes for up to £600,000 may not ‘provide value for money’, a report warns today. The National Audit Office, the spending watchdog, warns the cost to the taxpayer of the £3.7billion scheme is ‘uncertain at this stage but is likely to be significant.’ Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, raised her fears yesterday why the maximum purchase price of a property under the scheme needs to be so high. Spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warns the cost to the taxpayer of the £3.7billion Help to Buy scheme 'is likely to be significant' Under the first of the Government’s two Help to Buy scheme, you can buy a new-build home in England for up to £600,000. The average price of a home in the UK is £175,000. The buyer must put down a minimum deposit of five per cent, and the Government provides a loan for up to 20 per cent of the purchase price, which is interest-free for the first five years. Mrs Hodge said: ‘You have to ask why the Department for Communities and Local Government thinks that providing loans to people who are buying homes worth £600,000 is actually benefitting those most in need.’ In Wales, the maximum purchase price is £300,000, and there have been calls for the maximum price in England to be lowered too. Its report said there are significant question marks hanging over the scheme, such as whether people ‘would have bought a home anyway’ without a helping hand from the Government. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, raised her fears yesterday why the maximum purchase price of a property under the scheme needs to be so high . It states: ‘For these reasons, we cannot yet say whether the scheme will provide value for money.’The NAO also warns the DCLG ‘does not have a joined-up approach to evaluating the combined impact of its housing market initiatives.’ The warning comes as house prices are rising rapidly with prices reaching record levels in many parts of the country. The average cost of a home in some parts of London is £1.2million. For example, there is a second Help to Buy scheme, which is open to all types of homes, both old and new, and offers a Government guarantee on part of the buyer’s mortgage. The NAO also questioned why Help to Buy agents had been paid £1,000 for each completed case that they had assessed at the beginning of the scheme. The fee has been subsequently cut to £600, but an extra £600,000 was spent on fees during the first three months. On average, people signing up to the Help to Buy scheme earn £44,700. That is, either their individual salary or the joint salary of a couple buying together. This is only just higher than the average loan that they receive from the Government of £40,200 to help to buy the property. The vast majority of people using the scheme are first-time buyers, equal to nearly nine in ten buyers. It has been more popular in the North, than the South. More new homes were bought in the Midlands, the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber than in other regions. Kris Hopkins, the housing minister, said the Help to Buy scheme offers ‘indisputable value for money’ and should generate £4.8billion over its lifetime. During the first nine months of the scheme, which launch in April last year, nearly 13,000 families have bought a property.","The National Audit Office, warns over the cost of the £3.7billion scheme .

Philip Davies, Conservative Party MP, says that there is a deep disparity in how much spending goes towards different arts, with certain music like brass bands going overlooked . A Yorkshire MP has revealed the gulf in funding between opera for southern ‘luvvies’ and brass bands in the North’s working-class towns. Conservative Philip Davies has uncovered figures which show that opera is in line to receive £347million during the five years of the  current Parliament, compared with £1.8million for brass bands. He pointed out that most of the Arts Council’s funding for opera is for London and the South East, and that northern MPs had a long-standing concern that their local brass bands have not been getting a ‘fair lick of the saucepot’. He said: ‘There’s a massive disparity in the figures. The overwhelming majority of that funding is for London and the South East. ‘The question symbolises an issue that many people in the North  have with the relative funding of the Arts Council. ‘Brass bands may be perceived as working-class and opera as middle and upper-class things. ‘I think perhaps there is a worry that in effect the middle-class lobby at the Arts Council are keen to fund the things that middle-class luvvies like. That’s a concern.’ Brass bands have only received around £1.8 million from the government funding, far less that opera's £347 million over the last five years . Opera has long been seen as a rather more middle to upper-class enjoyment than something like brass bands, which some believe involve the community a lot more . Shipley MP Mr Davies, who unearthed . the figures through a parliamentary question, is a member of the . Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee which is currently conducting . an inquiry into arts funding across the country. He added: ‘I’ve been in Parliament for nine years. There’s been a long-standing concern among Yorkshire MPs of all parties that this is an issue and that brass bands haven’t been getting a fair lick of the saucepot. ‘Brass bands are really an essential part of the local community all over the country, particularly for people like us in the North. ‘In Bradford, where I am, we are particularly proud of the Black Dyke Band. They provide an awful lot of pleasure and are also an essential part of the local community. ‘I think most people find the disparity in funding too much but the figures are there and people will draw their own conclusions.’","Opera got £347 million over the last 5 years, Brass bands got £1.8 million .

Debo Adegbile, who once participated in the appeals process for convicted murdered and liberal cult hero Mumia Abu-Jamal, failed to win enough Senate votes to proceed to a final determination on his nomination. Vice President Joe Biden was on hand to cast a potential tiebreaking vote, but the 47-52 tally included 'no' votes from eight Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid, effectively killing the nomination. The White House fired off a scathing statement from the president so quickly that it misspelled Adegbile's name. Debo Adegbile, now President Obama's nominee to lead the DOJ's civil rights division, led the litigation program of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund when it asked the Supreme Court to void the death sentence of a cop-killer . Mumia Abu-Jamal, now a cult hero among death penalty opponents on the political left, escaped execution after Adegbile successfully argued that racial bias affected his jury selection . The vote, Obama said in that statement, was 'a travesty based on wildly unfair character attacks against a good and qualified public servant.' 'As a lawyer, Mr. Adgebile [sic] has played by the rules,' Obama insisted. 'And now, Washington politics have used the rules against him. The fact that his nomination was defeated solely based on his legal representation of a defendant runs contrary to a fundamental principle of our system of justice.' The White House press office later sent reporters a corrected version of the president's comments. Reid's defection to the GOP side wasn't the only unusual feature of Wednesday afternoon's stunning defeat for the Obama administration. In November, Senate Democrats changed the rules that govern the confirmation of presidential nominees, deciding that a 'cloture' vote – the motion to end debate and proceed to a final vote – should no longer require a supermajority of 60 votes to pass. Instead, such nominees only need 51 votes. But Adegbile fell far short of that lower threshold. Other Democrats who joined Reid, a Nevadan, to vote against Obama's nominee were Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Chris Coons of Delaware, Joe Donnolly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and John Walsh of Montana. Pryor and Manchin, in particular, face tough re-election fights in November. President Obama fired off a nasty statement complaining about the Senate's failure to approve Adegbile, after he touched down in Connecticut to give a speech defending his call for a higher minimum wage, in advance of a Democratic fundraising trip to Boston . Maureen Faulkner, widow of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner, called Adegbile's nomination after he defended her husband's murderer ''an abomination ... as if he had done something wonderful' An aide to a Republican senator told MailOnline that politics were very much in play. 'Reid switched sides to give those two [Manchin and Pryor] cover,' said the staffer, who asked for anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. 'Neither of them wanted to see ads back home linking them to a cop-killer. It's that simple.' Reid, in fact, had slammed Republicans for opposing Adegbile just moments before joining them, saying it was 'an affront to what it means to live in America.' He also claimed the GOP's staunch resistance was part of a party-wide effort to disenfranchise black voters who side with Democratic candidates in large numbers. 'They don't want people to vote and they especially don't want poor people to vote,' Reid said, before switching his allegiance. Abu-Jamal, in prison for the 1981 . murder of policeman Daniel Faulkner, received significant help from the . NAACP Legal Defense Fund in successfully appealing his death sentence. Adegbile . led those efforts as the organization's litigation director, filing . briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that racism tainted the jury . selection in his case. Politics: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (L) switched sides on Wednesday to vote against Adegbile, giving vulnerable Democrats facing tough re-election fights a rationale for opposing the nominee . The Senate Judiciary Committee's Ranking Member Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa (L) railed against Adegbile's race-based defense of a cop-killer, calling it 'a cause in search of legal justification' A broad swath of opponents of the . Obama nominee have included the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, . who recalled a vicious period of fractured race relations that . culminated in the murder of Faulkner, who was shot in the back, in the . stomach, and in the face. Officer Daniel Faulkner was murdered in 1981 while on a routine patrol in Philadelphia. bullet casings on the scene were tied to a gun registered to Mumia Abu-Jamal. Faulkner was shot first in the back, then in the front, and later in the face as he lay dying . John McNesby, the organization's president, called Adegbile's nomination 'an absolute slap in the face to every police officer, especially those who gave their lives in the line of duty.' 'There’s outrage, there’s resentment there’s disapproval. You name it and our cops are feeling it,' he said. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republicans' senior member on the powerful Judiciary Committee, delivered the day's most dramatic floor speech, outlining reasons why Adegbile shouldn't be handed the reins in the federal government's chief civil rights enforcement agency. Grassley said Adegbile's defense of Abu-Jamal was a progressive 'cause in search of a legal justification.' 'It was a cause premised on the notion that this country’s most notorious cop-killer, Mumia Abu-Jamal, was a victim,' he said. 'And the police officers, prosecutors, and the entire judicial system were to blame.' The Judiciary Committee narrowly approved Adegbile's nomination in February, setting up Wednesday's showdown on the Senate floor. Maureen Faulkner, the widow of Abu-Jamal's victim, had written to the committee to say that 'officers who knew Danny, and who, like him, put their lives on the line everyday, must now witness Adegbile, a man proud to have chosen to aid the murderer of their friend, singled out for honors and high office by the government of the United States.' 'It is an abomination to now reward Mr. Adegbile, as if he had done something wonderful.'","Debo Adegbile helped overturn Mumia Abu-Jamal's death sentence for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia policeman Daniel Faulkner .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:17 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:18 EST, 5 March 2014 . Drinking just one can of Coke a day could be bad for you, the World Health Organization said as it urged Americans to lower their daily amount of sugar. Under draft guidelines published on Wednesday, the health agency suggested sugar should make up just 5 percent of the total calories needed for a day - half of what it had previously suggested. The guideline means just one Coke, or six Oreo cookies, would be considered an excessive amount of sugar. Health warning: The amount of sugar in Coke and other sodas concerns experts from WHO . Who recommended the drop in sugar intake as a way to combat obesity and cavities, after its expert panel reviewed about 9,000 studies. Sugar has about 4 calories per gram, or 15 . calories per teaspoon. Under the 5 percent guideline, a person who takes . in 2000 calories a day would limit sugar to 25 grams. A 12-ounce can of . Coca-Cola has 35 grams of sugar, which is 10 grams over the allowance. One Oreo cookie has 4.5 grams, meaning you could eat only five and a half in one day. The guidelines will apply to sugars . that have been added to food, or are present in honey, syrups and fruit . juices. Sugar found naturally in fruits is not cause for concern. Dr Francesco Branca, WHO's director for nutrition, conceded the target was somewhat aspirational. 'We should aim for 5 percent if we can ... but 10 percent is more realistic,' he said. Americans and others in the West eat a lot more sugar than the recommended daily allowance of 25 grams. Their average sugar intake would have to drop by two-thirds to meet WHO's suggested limit. WHO's new guidelines have been published online and the agency is inviting the public to comment via its website until the end of March. Many doctors applauded the UN agency's attempt to limit the global sweet tooth. 'The less sugar you're eating, the better,' Dr Robert Lustig, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California and author of a book about the dangers of sugar, said. 'If the sugar threshold is lowered, I think breakfast cereal is going to have a really hard time justifying its existence,' he added, referring to sweetened cereals often targeted to children. Snack time: The guidelines will mean limiting the number of Oreos and cookies that are eaten . When WHO last revised its sugar guidelines more than a decade ago, it recommended sugar should be less than 10 percent of daily calories. The U.S. sugar industry was so incensed it lobbied Congress to threaten to withdraw millions of dollars in funding to WHO. A contentious reference to the sugar limit was removed from a global diet strategy, but the recommendation passed. Cut down: Draft guidelines suggest limiting the amount of sugar eaten daily . Lustig said WHO's new guidelines could alter the food environment by forcing manufacturers to rethink how they use sugar in processed foods like bread, soups, pasta sauces and even salad dressings. He called the amount of sugar in processed food an 'absolute, unmitigated disaster'. WHO's expert group found high sugar consumption is strongly linked to obesity and tooth decay. It noted that heavy people have a higher risk of chronic diseases, responsible for more than 60 percent of global deaths. Dental care costs up to 10 percent of health budgets in Western countries and cause significant problems in the developing world. WHO warned many of the sugars eaten today are hidden in processed foods, pointing out that one tablespoon of ketchup contains about one teaspoon of sugar and that for some people, including children, drinking a single can of sweetened soda would already exceed their daily sugar limit. There is no universally agreed consensus on how much sugar is too much. The American Heart Association advises limiting sugar to about 8 percent of your diet, or six teaspoons a day for women and nine for men. A study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published last month found too much sugar can raise the chances of fatal heart problems. Researchers found the average American gets about 15 percent of their calories from sugar, similar to other Western nations. New nutrition labels proposed in the U.S. will also require food manufacturers to list any added sugars, plus a more prominent calorie count. Sweet tooth: Health experts are concerned about the 'hidden sugar' in sweets and sodas . A chart shows the number of teaspoons of sugar found in cereals, energy drinks, hot chocolate and foods available in British supermarkets . Dr Branca said: ‘Obesity affects half . a billion people in the world and it is on the rise. ‘Sugar along with other risk . factors might certainly become the new tobacco in terms of public health . action. The consumption of a single serving of sugar sweetened soda . might actually already exceed the limit for a child. So certainly the . consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should be done with great care. ‘It actually is one of the elements that has been more constantly associated to increase weight gain particularly in children.’ Earlier this week, Britain's chief medical officer, Dr Sally Davies, said she thought sugar might be addictive and that the government should consider introducing a sugar tax to curb bulging waistlines. The UK has one of the fattest populations in Western Europe. 'We have a generation of children who, because they're overweight ... may not live as long as my generation,' she told a health committee. 'They will be the first generation that lives less and that is of great concern.' The guidelines will now be discussed by . academics and medical experts before a final version is published. But . Dr Branca said food and drinks manufacturers should drastically alter . their products.","Guidelines recommend only 25 grams a day - 10 grams less than amount found in sodas .

An 81-year-old woman had her handbag stolen after she stood up from her church pew to take communion. Silvia Federicei-Palmieri, a Brazilian believed to be on a long holiday in the UK, was at a morning church service on her birthday when a couple snatched her bag. Adrian Robertson, 40, was sentenced to five months in jail on Tuesday for the theft. Rebecca Mills, 32, pleaded guilty last month and was handed an eight-week sentence. The couple walked into a Sunday service at Our Lady Immaculate RC Church in Surbiton, Surrey, on January 19, the court heard. Congregation member Deborah Roberts said she saw Mills take the bag from the pew. She told Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court: ‘As they were about to go to sit down, she seemed to bend down and grab something. 'They walked back out of the pews together while he was looking over his shoulder.’ Churchgoers including Sunday school pupils chased the pair down the road but did not catch them. They were later arrested by police. Sunday school teacher Rachel Street told the court: ‘They were getting away. I was shouting at them, “I’m from the church, you have taken the bag”.’ Robertson, of West Ewell, Surrey, claimed he did not know Mills had taken the bag until after they left. Mills, of Epsom, Surrey, said she had not planned to steal it, but was drunk and ‘saw the opportunity’. Sentencing Robertson, District Judge Ken Grant described the theft as a ‘joint enterprise’, adding that stealing from an 81-year-old woman in church made the crime ‘particularly unpleasant’. Robertson, who stood trial at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court, is already serving a 13-week sentence for an earlier theft, and in 2009 was jailed for two and a half years for robbing a partially-sighted musician in Epsom. Communion: The theft took place during a morning service at Our Lady Immaculate Church in Surbiton . Congregation member Deborah Roberts, who gave evidence behind a screen, said she saw the pair enter the pews and thought they were going to sit down as people went up for communion. She said: 'As they were about to go to sit down, she seemed to bend down and grab something then they walked back out of the pews together while he was looking over his shoulder.' Ms Roberts said she pursued the pair out of the church and called after them but they walked away quickly and broke into a run. She said: 'She had gone to take communion, she had left her handbag in the pew to walk down the central aisle.' In the dock, Robertson claimed they only went into the church in order to use the toilet after sleeping rough under a flight of stairs the previous night. He claimed he did not know Mills had taken the bag until they had left the church. He said: 'I think she picked the bag up, it was by mistake. Nothing was taken from the bag. It was a drunken mistake.' Callous: The 81-year-old worshipper from Brazil stood up to take communion and left her purse behind . Robertson denied being on the look-out or playing any part in the theft. He said: 'Why would I want to take a bag when I was on the way to my Mum’s for Sunday dinner? 'That’s totally wrong. I’m Catholic myself. I did not see no bag or anything when I was in the church.' He said they walked out of the church, adding: 'The only time I ran is when I ran across the road and I stopped after that. I had no need to run.' While giving evidence Mills, who had a ponytail and navy top, said she did not plan to take the bag but just 'saw the opportunity' while under the influence of drink. She said: 'It was on the floor. I just picked it up. I went round the back towards M&S and threw it down because I thought it was wrong. I didn’t even open it.' She added: 'I threw the bag because I felt guilty. I took the blame and said I’m really sorry. You can’t blame someone else for what I have done.' After giving evidence she whispered to Robertson: 'I love you.'","Silvia Federicei-Palmieri, 81, believed to be on a long holiday from Brazil .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:35 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:52 EST, 26 February 2014 . Republicans in Congress have been licking their chops for nine months at the prospect of grilling embattled former IRS official Lois Lerner a second time, but her lawyer says they still can't have their chance. Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has called Lerner back for a second hearing on March 5 about a program that saw the IRS targeting tea party organizations and other right-leaning groups with intrusive questions and years-long delays when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status beginning in 2009. But in a letter to Issa, her attorney says she shouldn't have to appear because she has received death threats. If she does show up, he adds, she still won't answer questions unless she has immunity from prosecution or an order from a federal judge. Lerner appeared in a committee hearing in May 2013 but refused to answer questions, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But because she offered an opening statement in which she insisted 'I have not done anything wrong,' committee members ruled that she had waived that privilege. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner refused to answer questions in a May 2013 hearing, but the House Oversight Committee will haul her back for a proper grilling in March . Tea party groups have been up in arms for nine months, demanding action from the IRS after they were targeted for special scrutiny because of their political beliefs . In a letter to Lerner’s lawyer on Tuesday, Issa set March 5 as the date she will have to answer probing questions about her role in the scandal – and possibly finger higher-ups who directed her to play political favorites and hamstring conservative applicants. But her lawyer, William W. Taylor III, replied hours later with a letter saying he had warned committee staffers that 'calling Ms. Lerner [as a witness] knowing that she will assert her rights was not only improper but dangerous.' 'Ms. Lerner has been the subject of numerous threats on her life and safety, and on the life and safety of her family,' he wrote. 'I left with the staff recent evidence of those threats.' He added that her tune might change if she was promised she couldn't face criminal charges. 'If granted immunity, she has no choice but to testify … the essence of an order conferring immunity is that it commands her to testify,' Taylor told The Washington Times. Lerner, who retired in September with full benefits after a brief period of administration leave, is 'is uniquely positioned to provide testimony that will help the committee better understand how and why the IRS targeted these groups,' Issa wrote. 'The subpoena you accepted on Ms. Lerner’s behalf remains in effect,' he told Taylor. 'In light of this fact, and because the committee explicitly rejected her Fifth Amendment privilege claim, I expect her to provide answers when the hearing reconvenes.' The House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs has ruled that Lerner can't plead the Fifth Amendment like she did nine months ago, finding that she waived that privilege by giving a defensive opening statement . More than two dozen tea party groups have responded to what they say is unfair treatment by suing the federal government . Taylor didn't respond to a message seeking comment. The . IRS's practices became national news when Lerner casually dropped . information about targeting conservative groups into a . question-and-answer session during a Washington, D.C. meeting of tax . administrators in early May. Days . later, an internal audit of the agency was released, showing that some . tea party organizations' tax-exempt applications were held up for as . long as 30 months. Documents released by Issa's committee showed that . officials in Washington had a hand in taking over some cases from a . satellite office in Cincinnati, Ohio. More recently, an email surfaced showing that Lerner was among several officials who discussed a program in 2011 aimed at reviewing conservative groups' applications more closely in an 'off plan' strategy meant to be kept out of public view. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa may have larger ambitions: He told New Hampshire activists on Feb. 17 to unite against Obama's 'imperial presidency' The Obama administration has taken . heat from conservatives who insist that the White House had a role in . the plan, which matured at the height of the 2010 election season when . tea party activists were at their most vocal and effective. Democrats . in Congress have responded that there is no evidence anyone meant to . step on conservatives' right to freely exercise political speech. Now the IRS has moved to codify the ad hoc rules that put right-wing groups in limbo, proposing a raft of new regulations to govern the future evaluation of applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status. Its stated intention is to rein in overtly political activity by those applicants – including voter registration drives, candidate forums and other election-focused programs. Federal law prohibits groups receiving tax exemptions from electioneering. But Republicans say the IRS is playing favorites and stifling free speech, and they point to nearly 70,000 public comments submitted to the Treasury Department in opposition to the plan. A proposal in the House, expected to pass along party lines, would force a year-long moratorium before the IRS could formalize its proposed rules. But the measure faces almost certain defeat in the Democrat-controlled Senate. More than two dozen tea party groups have sued the federal government since last summer, with the American Center for Law and Justice representing most of them. 'The decision to recall Lois Lerner to testify before this House panel is not only appropriate but necessary to get to the bottom of this unlawful targeting scheme,' the group's lead counsel, Jay Sekulow, said Wednesday. 'The committee correctly concluded that Lerner waived her constitutional rights to refuse to answer questions before the panel. We know that she is deeply involved in this targeting scheme – even involved in planning new rules to restrict free speech ... It’s time for Lerner to stop the stonewalling – to present the facts and to tell the truth.'","Former IRS exempt organizations chief was forced into retirement after revealing a scheme to target right-wing groups with extra scrutiny .

Prosecutors in Florida have reversed their decision to accept an insanity plea for a father who kidnapped his two sons and tried to sail to Cuba last spring. Authorities had been prepared to let Joshua Hakken and his wife Sharyn get psychiatric treatment instead of prison - but a series of recent jailhouse phone calls have led them to believe that Joshua, at least, is faking it. The Hakkens were arrested in April after allegedly kidnapping their sons Cole and Chase, age 4 and 2, from there grandparents in North Tampa, Florida. The parents had lost custody of their children and the grandparents had sole legal guardianship because of multiple run-ins with police. Arrest: Sharyn Hakken, left, and her husband Joshua, right, allegedly kidnapped their sons, aged two and four, a week after Sharyn's mother had been granted custody of the boys last April . Chase, two, and four-year-old Cole were safely returned to the care of their grandparents last April after allegedly being abducted by their parents . 'Mr Hakken is feigning insanity,' Assistant State Attorney Rita Peters Peters declared at a court hearing Tuesday, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Ms . Peters said 'additional information that has developed since the last . court date' from Mr Hakken's jail phone calls that led prosecutors to . believe he was malingering. She did not go into detail about what exactly Mr Hakken said that led prosecutors to reverse course. Even . the expert witnesses called by he state had concluded that Mr Hakken, . an engineer, was 'paranoid and delusional' at the time he kidnapped his . children - believing that the federal government was performing mind . control experiments on him. The Hakkens sailed to Cuba, where they were apprehended by U.S. authorities and sent back to Tampa. The grandparents now have custody of the two children. Prosecutors . released evidence showing Joshua Hakken believed the federal government . was targeting him because he had uncovered a secret plot to poison . Americans with airplane chemicals. Jail cell footage released in September showed the couple discussing the plot to allegedly kidnap their sons - and desperately urging each other to stay quiet. Joshua . and Sharyn Hakken are seen embracing, kissing and apparently talking . about what they will say about the kidnapping on the video released by . prosecutors. Prosecutors . also shared a bizarre love letter Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old . woman whom she met in prison, in which she tells the former inmate she . is '100% committed to you and our relationship'.

After . the couple were tracked down in Cuba and returned to the U.S., they . were held in a Hillsborough County jail, where surveillance cameras . filmed their conversations on April 10. 'Be careful what you say to your cellmates,' Joshua Hakken, 45, says to his wife. 'No one can know about this.' 'I . know, I know, I know,' responds Sharyn Hakken, 34, later adding, 'I . said too much on the plane', as her husband comforts her, ABC News reported. The couple, who have both pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping charges, also apparently discussed their release from jail. 'When everything goes down I'll come . find you,' Joshua Hakken said, with his wife adding: 'If I get out . before you, I promise I'll wait for you.' Prosecutors plan to present the footage as evidence at a trial later this year. They also released photographs taken inside the Hakken's sailboat that show two child car seats, a gun and ammunition. Found: The couple's boat, 'Salty', is pictured moored at the Marina Hemingway complex in Havana on April 9 last year, six days after the couple allegedly set sail from Florida with their sons on board .

Authorities in Maryland have charged Baltimore police officer Alec Eugene Taylor with animal cruelty after they say he killed his girlfriend's puppy and texted her a photo of the dog's body . A 27-year-old Baltimore police officer was taken into custody on Wednesday after he allegedly beat and choked his girlfriend's 7-month-old puppy and texted her a photo of the dog's lifeless body. Alec Eugene Taylor of Silver Spring, a five-year veteran of the Baltimore department, was charged with aggravated animal cruelty, which is a felony, and abuse or neglect of an animal. Taylor allegedly confessed that he he beat the Jack Russell Terrier called Rocko because he was tired of the dog defecating on the carpet. He shared the dog with his girlfriend. County police said that Taylor's girlfriend first called them on Friday February 28 and claimed that Taylor had killed Rocko two days earlier. They said the girlfriend told them Taylor had texted her a written message that the dog defecated on the carpet and he killed it. Police said that then Taylor subsequently texted her a photo of what appeared to be a dead dog. Authorities said Taylor told his girlfriend he had beaten the dog with a mop and then put the body in an outdoor trash bin. Alec Eugene Taylor, 27, of the 13800 block of Castle Boulevard (pictured), told police he chased the Jack Russell terrier, named Rocko, out from behind a dryer and then throttled it until it was dead . Police said Taylor's girlfriend pleaded with him to retrieve Rocko's body from the dumpster so that she could bury him. Around 6:30 that evening, she returned home and found the dog's body in a shoebox on the balcony of their apartment. She took it to a park in nearby Hyattsville and buried Rocko. Officers with the Animal Services Division recovered the body and said a necropsy showed the cause of death was blunt force trauma  which resulted in 'acute hemorrhagic shock,' likely due to blood loss from liver damage. Authorities said Taylor told Animal Services that he used a mop to force Rocko from behind a dryer and choked the dog with his hands. Cute: Rocko was a Jack Russell terrier like the one pictured here and was only seven-months old . Baltimore police said Taylor was suspended without pay on Wednesday. The department said in a statement, 'Allegations of animal cruelty are taken seriously by the Baltimore Police Department. Over the course of the last year significant emphasis has been placed on developing and training investigators to handle animal abuse incidents in Baltimore.'

The ex-fire chief of Babbit, Minnesota, who has pleaded guilty to setting a series of fires in the Superior National Forest, has been diagnosed as a pyromaniac. Ryan Scharber, 30, pleaded guilty on Friday to one count of setting fires on U.S. forest land and to attempted arson on property used in interstate or foreign commerce. The father-of-three resigned as chief of the St. Louis County community’s volunteer fire department last December, after investigators traced the crimes to him and he eventually confessed. Ryan Scharber, who is married to Stefanie and has three children, is facing five years in jail after pleading guilty to setting nine fires on U.S. forest land . According to documents filed in federal court in Minneapolis on Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Dunne is requesting that Scharber should be given the maximum five-year sentence, reports the Star Tribune. In the memorandum, Dunne disputed Scharber’s contention that he had set the fires ‘to get out of the house for a few hours to get relief from his newborn child’s acid reflux.’ The prosecutor noted that Scharber hadn’t offered that excuse during the five-hour interview with investigators in which he eventually confessed on December 19, 2012. ‘The psychiatrist at the Range Mental Health Center diagnosed the defendant with pyromania,’ Dunne wrote. ‘The real reason behind the defendant’s criminal conduct in this case was that diagnosis.’ In total, Scharber admitted to nine fires and one attempted arson at a resort over a 13 month period in 2010 and 2011 while he was the local fire chief . Scharber resigned as chief of the St. Louis County community's volunteer fire department last December after initially denying the charges . At one stage Scharber claimed his actions were the result of wanting 'to get out of the house for a few hours to get relief from his newborn child’s acid reflux' Dunne said Scharber 'utterly violated the trust the public granted to him as the fire chief in Babbitt,' reports the NNCNow.com. Federal prosecutors say he set fires in the Superior National Forest on Oct. 7-9 and Oct. 11, 2011, and on April 29 and Sept. 10, 2012, all in Babbitt. Scharber also was charged with attempted arson at Mattila's Birch Lake Resort in Babbitt on Dec. 3, 2011. Altogether, he admitted to setting nine fires, plus the attempted arson at the resort, over 13 months in 2010 and 2011. In seeking a shorter sentence, his attorney, Joseph Tamburino, wrote on Feb. 14 that when Scharber pleaded guilty, he cooperated with authorities and showed 'extreme remorse.' His attorney wrote that Scharber had demonstrated willingness to seek and enter therapy for his behavior and has the support of his family and community members. Tamburino also noted that Scharber had only set 'small fires in small unpopulated areas' and has no criminal history. Scharber also was charged with attempted arson at Mattila's Birch Lake Resort in Babbitt on Dec. 3, 2011 . 'He never intended that the fires destroy large amounts of property or endanger the lives or well-being of anyone in the community,' the attorney said. Prosecutors say the fires put pedestrians and motorists at risk, and that firefighters, police officers and emergency responders faced danger when they responded to the calls. Two searches were made of Scharber’s home and 34 people were interviewed as part of the invesitgation. Scharber will be sentenced on April 10.","Ryan Scharber, the former fire chief of Babbit, Minnesota, is facing up to five years in prison .

'Ready to die for my cause': Michael Piggin, 18, is accused of plotting a Columbine-style massacre . The schoolboy accused of  plotting a ‘Columbine-style’  massacre, including bombing a school, university, mosque and cinema, has been named. Michael Piggin, 18, planned the attack when he was 17, compiling a ‘hit list’ of pupils and teachers he wanted to eliminate, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. The neo-Nazi teenager, who can be named for the first time after turning 18 in January, stockpiled an arsenal in his bedroom, including pipe bombs, partially assembled petrol bombs and air rifles. Inspired by the infamous Columbine high school massacre, he compiled a list of six potential targets, including his former school in Loughborough, the town’s university, council offices, a mosque and cinema, it is alleged. Piggin was arrested in February last year. Police found several notebooks and recordings detailing his alleged plans in his bedroom, as well as a variety of weapons, including IEDs, a crossbow and pyrotechnic fuse cords. There was also a stab-proof vest, gas mask, blank firing pistols, three ball-bearing guns, a military belt and an illegal terror manual, Mujahideen Poisons Handbook. Also found was a Che Guevara notebook decorated with a Nazi swastika and SS runes in which Piggin ranted about his sinister plans. He had written ‘EDL no surrender British and proud’ on its cover, the court heard. He also drew pictures of the Batman villain, The Joker, and quoted the Batman film The Dark Knight, writing ‘introduce anarchy, upset the established order and everything causes chaos. I’m an agent of chaos and you know a good thing about chaos – it’s fair’. A self-proclaimed member of the English Defence League, he wrote rambling notes about the need for ‘Britain and Europe to rise up and fight’ against Islam and warned ‘when order fails, violence prevails’. Piggin, a neo-Nazi teenager, who can be named for the first time after turning 18 in January, stockpiled an arsenal in his bedroom, including pipe bombs, partially assembled petrol bombs and air rifles . And in a chilling dictaphone message played to the court, Piggin spoke in an impassioned voice about the need ‘to hit back at the scum, the powerful’. He said he hoped his ‘operation’ will ‘inspire the intelligent people to start some sort of revolution against the current system’. The teenager, who at the time was living at home with his mother, adds: ‘People are living in a world of delusion. I’m ready to die for my cause.’ ‘How the f*** could anyone treat a fellow person like people’s (sic) treated me. That’s a question you want to be asking, that’s what drives people to do this. Look at all the f****** things in the past. 'Columbine, Virginia Tech, numbers of others. All because of bullying and how people are treated.’ The Old Bailey heard that two of the teenager’s friends, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have pleaded guilty to possessing either petrol bombs or pipe bombs. Piggin allegedly scrawled the phrase 'the new Columbine' in a notebook, referring to the American high school massacre, carried out by pupils Dylan Klebold (pictured) and Eric Harris . But Piggin, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, was set apart from his friends and driven by a paranoia of ‘Islamic invasion of Europe’. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the jury that the teenager’s plot and his haul of weaponry was not ‘child’s play’ but a deadly threat. He said: ‘For an average young man in an average house in Loughborough or any town you care to name in England and Wales, you may think that is startling. ‘That is what this case is about. ‘The final item is a notebook containing information about the planning of attacks and study of explosive devices. He said in one of Piggin’s notebooks, he scrawled the phrase ‘the new Columbine’ – referring to the notorious American high school massacre, in which 12 pupils and one teacher were killed. Mr Hill added that Piggin was a ‘would-be terrorist’ intent on carrying out a copycat killing in Britain. He said of the 1999 mass shooting: ‘That’s something that you’ll want to assess in this case given that this defendant, not in Colorado USA but in Loughborough England, was writing “the new Columbine” in his notebook. Klebold and Harris, the mass killers in Columbine, were aged 17 and 19 at the time of those atrocities. What you have in this case is a 17-year-old.’ Piggin denies possessing items for terrorism and a terror manual, but admitted possession of petrol and pipe bombs and components of IEDs. Mr Hill said Piggin’s Asperger’s condition ‘does not undermine his capacity and ability to commit the offences alleged’. Wearing an Arctic Monkeys T-shirt, Piggin was assisted in the dock by an intermediary to help him follow proceedings. The trial continues.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:51 EST, 4 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 14:47 EST, 4 March 2014 . Much of President Obama's 2015 budget proposal won't get through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, but the White House has unveiled it anyway – a liberal Democratic wish list of policies, many of which the GOP has already nixed or refused to take up. The White House said Tuesday that the president's budget, all $3.901 trillion of it, would fully fund Obamacare, raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and index it to inflation, vastly expand infrastructure-repair plans that benefit labor unions, and significantly reduces the size of the U.S. standing army. House Republicans will object to these and other measures, but the Democrat-controlled Senate has the first hearings on the budget, scheduled for Wednesday morning. White House Budget Office director Sylvia Mathews Burwell will testify. The budget blueprint claims that $402 billion in savings related to the Affordable Care Act will offset new spending. That number is based on last year's budget, which called deep cuts to Medicare, trimming more than $300 billion from provider payments and another $50 billion from senior citizens. Scroll down for video . Going it alone? Obama spoke about his FY2015 budget at a Washington, DC elementary school, looking isolated on a carpet decorated with cartoonish drawings of the alphabet . The opposition: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (L), House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (C) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R) will be waiting with knives out when Obama's ambitious budget hits Capitol Hill . But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office declared in February that the overall cost of the Obamacare law would eclipse $2 trillion over ten years, erasing much of that savings. Obama presented his budget during a photo-op at a Washington, D.C. school, emphasizing education initiatives that were largely lost in the static about larger spending numbers. Republicans are already complaining. The budget proposal 'would hollow out our defense capabilities. And it would do nothing to preserve or strengthen our entitlements,' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a statement. Obama's budget restores cuts in Social Security payments that he offered Republicans just a few months ago as an enticement to reaching the eventual budget deal in December. 'The president has just three years left in his administration, and yet he seems determined to do nothing about our fiscal challenges,' said Ryan. 'This budget isn’t a serious document; it’s a campaign brochure.' 'It would demand that families pay more so Washington can spend more,' he added. But the details reveal a proposal that will cut the tax burdens of some families – with a $60 billion expansion of the poverty-fighting Earned Income Tax Credit, for instance – while hiking costs for the wealthy and big corporations that create jobs. Obama played with schoolchildren after addressing an ambitious $3.9 trillion budget proposal . And the president wants to spend an additional $56 billion for new stimulus projects and $302 billion on infrastructure repairs over four years – pleasing labor unions, a major Democratic constituency. Ryan and House Republicans are expected to release their own budget proposal in April, starting the inevitable back-and-forth sniping that will likely culminate in a fiscal showdown just before the November midterm elections. Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP's vice presidential candidate in 2012, has emerged as the budget negotiator for Speaker John Boehner, but some tea party-aligned members of Congress fear that he will give too much away to the Democrat-controlled Senate . Republicans are 'counting on building the tension up to a breaking point,' a GOP election strategist in North Carolina told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'They're betting that jobs, the economy and Obamacare will look so bad by November that the Senate Democrats will do just about anything to save their own skins.' The GOP needs to capture just six seats in the U.S. Senate this year in order to retake the majority and control both houses of Congress. Vulnerable Democratic incumbents in at least five states have said they don't intend to campaign for re-election with President Obama by their side. Obama's proposal, Rep. Ryan's office said, would add $8.3 trillion to the national debt in the long-term and raise $1.8 trillion in new tax revenue. That includes the so-called 'Buffett Rule' tax which Obama has championed. That measure, according to the White House, would 'require that millionaires pay no less than 30 percent of income – after charitable contributions' in federal income taxes. Another hit to the wealthiest Americans will come in the elimination of a specialized 'carried interest' provision in the federal tax code. That item allows private fund managers on Wall Street to cut their income tax rates for most of what they earn. Americans for Prosperity, a tea party-backed conservative group, said Obama's budget proposal is 'not a serious attempt to solve our nation’s fiscal problems.' Tim Phillips, the group's president, added that 'once again, President Obama has produced a budget that doesn’t balance, runs annual deficits, and relies on partisan politics, instead of a fiscally responsible, pro-growth tax policy.'","Wish list is likely dead-on-arrival in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives .
It would formalize a national minimum wage hike while enforcing the 'Buffett Rule' that sets minimum actual income tax levels for millionaires .

Vets have been 'astonished' by the strength T-Rex has developed - and his 6,000 Instagram followers have also clearly been impressed. This adorable puppy, named T-Rex, has become an internet sensation after learning to deal with his disability . The Daschund-Chihuahua cross was given the name T-Rex because of his likeness to the carnivorous dinosaur . T-Rex was born into a litter of six males puppies - three of which were born with disabilities. While T-Rex survived along with another Chiweenie that was born without front legs, their sibling - born without back legs - sadly passed away. After being born in April, T-Rex got a new owner in July and is thriving in his new home. Owner Felix Wiegmann, an electrician from San Antonio, Texas, got the dog from his cousin - who named the puppy as soon as he was born. ‘The vets are astonished by how strong he is,' he said. ‘T-Rex was offered to several family friends of my cousins, but always ended up being declined because of his disabilities. ‘But while taking care of T-Rex, my cousin and her family ended up getting attached to him and decided that T-Rex was going to stay and be a part of their family.’ Eight-month-old T-Rex, who has learned to stand on his hind legs, has 6,000 Instagram followers . T-Rex was born into a litter of six males puppies - three of which were born with disabilities . He explained that T-Rex is a dog that needs ‘a lot of attention’ and his cousin eventually decided to keep him away in the family. ‘My cousin and her family did consider having him put down at first and were really frightened. They thought he wasn't going to be able to get around. ‘However after doing some research they found that he could grow up to be just fine.’ The Instagram account for T-Rex was already up and running when Mr Wiegmann got him, but the account now boasts over 6,000 followers.

'T-Rex just knows that if he goes on the kitchen tiles or concrete he will take a little longer. He gets on his two back legs to walk or hop. 'I think the other animals are more aware of his disability than he is. We have five cats and another dog, a Bichon Frise called Matilda, who don't all like each other, but they have all taken well to T-Rex.' Over time T-Rex is expected to use a wheelchair during the day to reduce the amount of stress on his back.

As . the court released Estevez without bail, more than a dozen cops and . detectives descended on her Queens home with a crime scene unit truck . and two other vehicles, according to a neighbor. Police . believe Rodriguez gave birth in Estevez’s home on Wednesday. The . investigators spent two hours going through an upstairs apartment where . Estevez’s family lives. Rodriguez was arrested on October 17 along with her friend Francis Estevez, 17, in a . Victoria’s Secret shop on 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan. The grisly discovery was made when the two girls were stopped by a . security guard as they left the store in Herald Square on suspicion of . shoplifting. But as well as . allegedly finding hundreds of dollars worth of stolen goods inside the . bags, the guard noticed there was a strong odor inside and found a tiny . body under the loot.

Rodriguez is due back in court on December 10. Found: Investigators remove evidence bags containing the male fetus from the scene on Thursday . A recent autopsy of the dead baby was . inconclusive, and more tests will be needed to determine how the fetus . died, according to the city medical examiner's office. But New York Police Department spokesman, . John McCarthy, said that the case was still being investigated and that . police were awaiting the medical examiners' determination of the cause . of death. After Rodriguez was arrested on Thursday she was taken to Bellevue Hospital and both girls were arrested on petit larceny charges. A few hours later the fetus was removed . by Medical Examiner's Office workers, who also removed other bags of . potential evidence. Medical attention: Tiona Rodriguez, who said she had had a miscarriage, is taken away in a wheelchair . A woman who said she was the other girl's mother said she hadn't spoken with her daughter since her arrest and hung up. On her Facebook page late on . Wednesday night, Rodriguez had complained about period cramps, and . added that she was excited about an upcoming job interview at Chipotle. Rodriguez and Estevez are both charged . with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. Estevez . allegedly had $230 worth of clothes and cosmetics in her bag. One of Tiona's neighbors said she was shocked to hear the teenager had been pregnant. Zami . Ford, 17, said: 'I’ve known her since she was little. She was probably . nervous and didn't know what to do. She would never hurt anyone.' She said she was unaware of the teen's pregnancy and was stunned by the allegations. 'She's a good girl. I can't believe she would do that.' Health problems: Tiona had complained of period pains the day before she was stopped in Victoria's Secret . Teen mom: Tiona, who has a two-year-old son, told police she had a miscarriage the day before .

Puerto Rico national Aurea Vazquez Rijos is wanted by US federal authorities after she allegedly offered a man $3milllion to kill her Canadian husband Adam Anhang. Mr Anhang, 32, was beaten and stabbed to death in Puerto Rico in 2005 as he walked with Vazquez close to a bar he had bought for her. Plea: Aurea Vazquez Rijos is facing extradition to the US after she was accused of hiring a hit man to kill her rich husband Adam Anhang. The 33-year-old is pictured during the hearing in Madrid . Back in better times: Aurea Vazquez Rijos is wanted by US federal authorities after she allegedly offered a man $3milllion to kill her Canadian husband Adam Anhang . At today's hearing in Madrid, 33-year-old Vazquez claimed she was not aware that she was wanted by US authorities until she arrived in Spain, having lived legally in Italy since 2008. The blonde said that she was at risk of being given the death penalty, despite the fact that, according to her, there was no case against her. As a US Caribbean territory, residents of Puerto Rico are US citizens. Although they can not vote in US presidential elections and do not pay federal income tax, they are subject to US federal laws and can be sentenced to death. Puerto Rico's government has requested that federal prosecutors stop . seeking the death penalty in Puerto Rico, and that juries . in the country have rejected death penalty cases six times in recent history. Vazquez was arrested in Madrid in June, after flying to Spain from Italy. Anhang developed seaside hotels and apartment blocks in Puerto Rico as well as serving as CEO of a Costa Rica-based online gambling software company . In 2008, the year she moved to Italy, she was indicted by a US grand jury following the accusations that she had hired a hitman to kill wealthy Mr Anhang, who  had developed seaside hotels and apartment blocks in Puerto Rico as well as serving . as CEO of a Costa Rica-based online gambling software company. Back then, Vazquez refused to cooperate with police and filed a civil . lawsuit against Anhang's family, seeking $1million in damages and . millions more from his estate. A judge in Puerto Rico dismissed the . suit. Alex Pabon Colon has since been charged with the killing and pleaded guilty, cooperating with investigators. Several . others, including members of Vazquez's family, have been arrested and . charged in the case. The Spanish National Court is expected to rule on the extradition within the next three weeks. Vazquez said she had an Italian residence permit, and had given birth to twins by another man while living in the country. Unaware: Vazquez claimed she was not aware that she was wanted by US authorities until she arrived in Spain, having lived legally in Italy since 2008 . She also told the hearing that she worked as a tourist guide and had travelled frequently in Europe, adding that she had her American passport renewed in Italy last year. She asked the court how she could have done all of this if there had been an arrest warrant out for her, and claimed that when she flew to Madrid in June she was duped into thinking she was to meet a group of tourists. She said she was arrested as she stepped off the plane. 'There is an act of the Mafia and corruption behind all of this,' she told the hearing. Vazquez's lawyer, Isaac Abad Gomez, argued against the extradition, saying there was no guarantee that Vazquez would not face life imprisonment without parole should she be handed over to US authorities. He also said the arrest order was faulty. Questionable: Vazquez refused to cooperate with police and filed a civil lawsuit against Anhang's family, seeking $1million in damages and millions more from his estate . Spanish law does not permit the extradition of people who could face the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole. However, the Spanish prosecutor said he favored extradition as long as there were guarantees that Vazquez would not face either of these two punishments. The defendant wept as she was handcuffed from behind and led away from the courtroom. The murder victim's father, Abe Anhang, said he was happy his former daughter-in-law had been detained. 'Our family is most grateful for the efforts of the FBI, Interpol and the Spanish police for apprehending her, and to the courts in Spain for dealing with this so efficiently, ' said Mr Anhang senior, who lives in Winnipeg, Canada. 'After eight years, we are looking forward to justice and closure.'","Aurea Vazquez Rijos is accused of offering a man $3m to kill Adam Anhang .

A married mother from Missouri is facing a child endangerment charge after police said she was photographed topless in a hot tub along with her half-naked 14-year-old daughter. The 50-year-old woman, of Wentzville, is not being named to protect her daughter's identity. The photo that landed the mother in trouble with the law was taken November 14 with the 14-year-old's phone by her sister, according to charging documents. Scroll down for video . Parent trap: A married Missouri mother, 50 (pictured), has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly  posing topless along with her 14-year-old daughter in their hot tub . Crime scene: The woman claimed that she was getting out of this hot tub when she spotted her other daughter snapping a picture, which she then told her to delete . The topless snapshot was posted on the social media app SnapChat and was circulated around two high schools in the Rockwood School District. St Charles County Prosecutor Tim Lohmar told St Louis Post-Dispatch that 50-year-old woman told police she had no idea her topless shot will be distributed online. The woman's son goes to one of the schools where students saw the image on SnapChat, and he was subjected to ridicule by his classmates over the picture, authorities said. According to Lohmar, it is clear that the mother and her teenage daughter were posing for the photo: both were covering their nipples, but their breasts were exposed. According to the Wentzville Police Department, the 14-year-old girl last year had 'court mandated counseling' for taking nude photos of herself and circulating them around her school. The 50-year-old mother could face up to a year in prison if convicted of misdemeanor child endangerment. Disseminated: The topless snapshot was posted on the social media app SnapChat and circulated around two high schools . When a reporter from the station KMOV caught up with the mother at her home on Winding Creek Drive, the woman insisted she had no intention of posing topless with her underage daughter. 'I wasn't posing, I was getting out of the tub,' she said. According to the mom, she saw her other daughter snap the picture and ordered her to delete it, but instead the X-rated print ended up on the popular social media app that allows users to share content that disappears after a few seconds. â€˜This is an example of some extremely poor judgment by a parent,â€™ Lohmar said.","The Wentzville, Missouri, woman told police she was emerging from hot tub when her other daughter took the picture .

In scenes which will infuriate the 55-year-old singer, Brahim Zaibat danced with Valerie Trierweiler at the Elysee Palace in Paris. Ms Trierweiler is the partner of French President Francois Hollande, but made a bee-line for Zaibat, 25, at her official Christmas Party on Wednesday. He's got a type: Brahim Zaibat grabbed hold of Valerie Trierweiler, the girlfriend of President Francois Hollande, at a Christmas party in the Elysee . Wearing a figure-hugging party dress and a big smile, 48-year-old Ms Trierweiler looked delighted as she clung hold of the young backing dancer. After their performance on the dance floor, Brahim gave his partner a big kiss before an irritated looking Mr Hollande shuffled towards the pair. ‘It was frankly all a bit awkward,’ said one Elysee Palace source. ‘The President’s consort is not meant to dance with younger men in public view.’ Soon afterwards, Brahim tweeted pictures and even a video of his triumphant dance – making sure that Madonna would see it. Sharing a laugh: Brahim Zaibat had been invited to the annual Christmas party at the Elysee Palace in Paris and joined Ms Trierweiler on the dancefloor .

Ms Trierweiler and Zaibat had their arms around each other as their danced in front of a Christmas tree . Brahim stands next to Trierweiler as Hollande takes to the stage at the Christmas party . Madonna and Brahim were together for three years and at one stage looked as though they might marry. But the relationship ‘ran its course’, said a source close to the singer, adding: ‘They were dancing and working together all the time and then they barely saw each other.’ Brahim, who was a backup dancer on Madonna's MDNA world tour, is currently competing on the French version of ‘Dancing With the Stars’. This has enabled him to build up his own fan base in his own country,  and he is now a household name in France in his own right. Controversial couple: Brahim Zaibat and Madonna, pictured in May this year, were together for three years before breaking up this autumn . Causing a scandal: French President Francois Hollande, 59, was still living with his ex-partner when he began an affair with Ms Trierweiler, 48, a political journalist . However, he still longs for international stardom, especially in countries like Britain and America. Ms Trierweiler has became an extremely controversial character since moving into the Elysee last year. She has fallen out with Segolene Royal, the mother of Mr Hollande’s four children, none of whom speak to Ms Trierweiler any more. Last year it emerged that Ms Trierweiler had been having an affair with Mr Hollande while he still lived with Ms Royal, and she was at one stage sharing the Socialist politician with a conservative lover. As Ms Trierweiler’s approval ratings plunged, many argued that taxpayers’ money should not be used to fund her lavish lifestyle at the Elysee.","Brahim Zaibat danced with Valerie Trierweiler at the Elysee Palace in Paris .

Good Morning America host Robin Roberts has reportedly signed a new long-term contract with ABC worth up to $14 million a year. The mega deal, which Page Six reported to be between $13 million and $14 million, was kept hush hush by network reps, who still refuse to say whether or not one has even been signed. 'Over a month ago, they quietly . inked a new, long-term, very high seven-figure deal with Robin that will . keep [her] at the company for years to come,' a source told Page Six. 'It . was a friendly negotiation. Robinâ€™s been [at ABC News] for over 20 . years... and will be a leader there for a very long time to come.' Deals: Robin Roberts, front left, has reportedly signed a new deal with ABC worth up to $14 million. Her co-hosts Josh Elliott, top left, and Lara Spencer, top right, are also in the process of negotiating deals . They . added that Roberts, 53, who took off six months from the show for a bone . marrow transplant after being diagnosed with cancer, was grateful for . the network's support when she was ill. But she also made it clear that she wanted a 'fair deal' from execs, the source told the paper. It added that a representative claimed that the deal was actually for below $10 million, but other sources refuted this. Roberts' battle with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been a central story on the morning show, with cameras following her throughout her treatment. Popular: This week Robin Roberts and fellow host Josh Elliott met Pope Francis outside the Vatican . She underwent several sessions of chemotherapy, and on September 20, 2012, she had a marrow transplant from her sister Sally-Ann, before returning to the show part-time in February. After several setbacks and returns to the hospital, she went on vacation to Maui, Hawaii, with a group of friends in August for some time to recuperate. This year, on the anniversary of the successful transplant, GMA threw her a one-year birthday party. She also resumed her five-day-a-week schedule this past September. Despite her turbulent past year, Roberts, who joined the network in 1995, has kept busy and announced in May that she will publishing a memoir, set to hit shelves in April 2014. Support: Roberts took off six months to undergo a bone marrow transplant and thanked ABC for its support . Revelations about her latest deal with the network comes at the same time that the show is also having to negotiate deals with other hosts of the show, Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer. With the show taking the number one spot in the ratings, sources said the question is now whether the network is willing to commend the work of the other hosts with similarly high pay checks. The other anchors are believed to have begun talks with ABC, although there had been reports that they were also looking at other networks. George Stephanopoulos is believed to be signed to the network through 2014. GMA has long held the top position among the morning show ratings. For the week of December 2, 5.874 million people turned in compared to the Today show's 5.213 million and CBS' 3.112 million.","Good Morning America anchor, 53, 'signed long-term deal quietly'"

The man accused of killing Usher's 11-year-old stepson Kile Glover while operating a jet ski on a Georgia lake in July 2012, has been sentenced to four years in prison. Jeffrey Hubbard, a close friend of Kile's father Ryan Glover, had been found guilty of all five charges - homicide by vessel, serious injury by vessel, reckless operation, unlawful operation of personal watercraft and boat traffic violation - by a Hall County jury last month. Kile never regain consciousness following the incident on Lake Lanier, northeast of Atlanta. A second victim, Jordan Shepp, then 15, was also seriously hurt. Jeffrey Hubbard was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday after being found guilty of all five charges brought against him over the death of Kile Glover . Guilty: Hubbard was found guilty on Thursday of homicide, serious injury by vessel, reckless operation, unlawful operation of personal watercraft and boat traffic violation . Tragic loss: Usher with Kile and ex-wife Tameka at the 2008 Kids' Choice Awards in Westwood, California . Defense lawyers had claimed that Hubbard tried to avoid the children and that what happened was a tragic accident, reports WSB-TV. Kile's mom Tameka Raymond was married to Usher . (real name: Usher Terry Raymond IV), 35, for two years. They divorced in . 2009 and had been in the throes of a bitter custody . battle over their sons - Usher Raymond V, six, and Naviyd, five - when Kile was tragically killed. Hubbard was arrested March 1, 2013, after being indicted by a grand jury. 'At the end of the day, I know he didn’t do it on purpose,' Foster told WSB-TV. 'He could’ve only loved Kile.'

Let the mourners come: The horse-drawn carriage arrives outside the church for Kile's 2012 funeral . In court this week, Kile’s . stepmother, Marsha Glover, cried as she told the court that Hubbard had . been driving his jet ski in a reckless manner prior to the collision. ‘He was just zooming back and forth, yelling with no hands standing on the jet ski. Just really crazy and erratic,’ she said. State investigators said they did not believe Hubbard was intoxicated at the time of the incident. Glover said she and her husband Ryan . saw Hubbard racing toward their pontoon boat, which was towing their son . and Shepp on an inner tube. ‘We . looked up and I saw Jeff coming as if he was coming directly toward the . boat. And before I knew it, there was a big cloud of water,’ Glover . said. She told the jury that seconds later, she and her husband realized the jet ski had struck the two children on the tube. Close: Usher, who is currently a judge on The Voice, was devastated by his stepson's death . ‘I . screamed. My husband immediately jumped in the water. I was on the . phone with 911, our kids are in the water and we need help,’ Glover . said. Kile, who was wearing a life preserver, was unresponsive when he was pulled from the lake. Both children were airlifted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. Kile was . declared brain dead on July 8 and on July 21 he died after being removed from life support. Just over a year later, on August 5, . 2013, Usher's eldest son, Usher V, was hospitalized in the ICU after he . became stuck in a drain while swimming in a pool at Usher's home. The . next day, Foster filed a request for an emergency custody hearing in . Fulton County Superior Court, seeking temporary primary custody and . citing Usher V's ‘near-death accident’ as evidence of a lack of . supervision of the children. At the hearing on August 9, 2013, the case was dismissed and Usher retained primary custody of their two sons. The courtroom showdown between the former couple took a surprising turn, when Usher offered his ex-wife a consoling hug. Almost a year after Kile's death, Tameka lost her custody battle with the R&B singer .

The crew from a Coast Guard ice cutter have saved a dog that was frozen in Lake St. Clair in Michigan. The ship was headed to search for any other vessels that could have been trapped in the frozen ice when they spotted a group of foxes surrounding something in the distance. As they made their way closer to the site, they realized that a dog had become trapped in the layers of ice and was near death. Handling with care: Two officers from a Coast Guard ice cutter came to the aid of this dog who was trapped in this ice on Lake St. Clair on the Michigan-Canada border on Monday . 'It was cold, weak and tired. It may have been out there for a couple of days or so,' Chief Petty Officer Alan Haraf told The Detroit Free Press. 'They noticed three burrows the dog tried to dig for itself for protection. They said the paws were bleeding and the nails were pretty much down to nothing.' Three petty officers on board the ice cutter, called the Bristol Bay, packed on their cold weather gear and rescued the dog. The dog, which the crew members nicknamed 'Lucky', was wearing a collar and harness but did not have a tag. Making a stop: The boat was looking for stranded vessels when it spotted a group of foxes that had surrounded this dog . Once the dog was brought back on board using a stretcher, he was warmed up by the officers and fed some chicken breast. The ice breaker headed back to Detroit from there and one of the officers took it to a local veterinarian. The vet was able to determine that the dog was a mixed breed and about 11 years old. It still remains unclear how the dog got out onto the ice and how he became stuck. 'Hopefully he'll find a home. He's such a darn good dog,' Petty Officer Brian Essler told The Detroit Free Press.","The crew from the Bristol Bay ice cutter was searching Lake St. Clair which borders Michigan and Canada on Monday when it spotted the dog .

A Florida woman's Coast Guard boot-camp commander forced her to scrub his office on her hands and knees and ordered another recruit to strip and have sex with him, she has revealed. Elisha Morrow, from Boyton Beach, and three other young recruits were subject to extreme sexual harassment at a boot camp in Cape May, New Jersey, after Chief Petty Officer Carlos Resendez selected them for 'house mouse' duty in 2009 and 2010. She said Resendez, who also taught training classes to quash sexual harassment, would order the women - all blonde, around 5 feet 3 inches tall and in their early 20s - to one at a time scrub his office late at night while he stood over them commenting on their bodies. Scroll down for video . Lobbying: Elisha Morrow, from Boyton Beach, left with U.S. Rep Lois Frankel, is in Washington pushing for new laws after she and three other young recruits were subject to extreme sexual harassment at a boot camp in Cape May, New Jersey . Now Morrow is taking her experiences to Washington, where she is pushing to make it easier to prosecute military commanders who victimize the men and women under their control. A provision inspired by the now-26-year-old's story has passed the U.S. House and it's expected to clear the Senate today. 'I think all members of Congress need to get on board with this and say, ""We're not going to allow this to happen to our troops,""' Morrow, now a police dispatcher in Palm Beach Gardens, told the Sun Sentinel. 'I'm not sure they are all quite there yet.' Resendez was sent to military prison for a year on charges of maltreating subordinates and adultery. Morrow said she thought about faking a suicide attempt to get away from him while the harrassment was going on. 'He haunts your person by day and your dreams at night,' she said, describing the impact of the treatment. Speaking out: Elisha Morrow, pictured left in April, and Tiffany Berkland, right, were sexually harassed by the same company commander when they were in basic training after joining the Coast Guard . She and another victim, Tiffany . Berkland, did not immediately report the harassment for fear of being . kicked out of the Coast Guard but came forward when they met a third . victim. When their case went to trial, they met a fourth young woman who had been raped recently by the same company commander. Morrow . testified in the investigation that led to the court martial, however . felt guilty, particularly for the woman who he forced to have sex with . him, that she didn't come forward sooner. 'I had to tell her I was sorry that I hadn't reported that this had happened,' she told the Sentinel. 'That's why I'm pushing so hard for this (legislation).' Prosecutors could not pursue more serious sexual assault charges against the commander because military law requires proof of physical or life-threatening harm to the victim. Angered, Morrow took her story to the . Democratic Representative for Palm Beach Lois Frankel, who proposed . legislation that was added to a major defense bill, the Sentinel . reports. Scene: The harassment occurred at Coast Guard Training Center at Cape May, New Jersey, where Commanders are seen conducting basic training techniques . The bill directs a military tribunal to redefine sexual assault in the military realm. Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson introduced the same provision in the Senate. 'From my point of view as the mother of a Marine war veteran, what struck me is that our sons and daughters put their military uniforms on to protect us. So we must do all we can to protect them,' Frankel told the newspaper. The bill also reportedly contains provisions to block military commanders from overturning jury convictions and to require a civilian review if a commander declines to prosecute a case. Morrow believes it is a good first step but more needs to be done. 'These people, they get a slap on the wrist and they are discharged,' she explained. 'And then they end up being people's neighbors. They end up being in the community. They are not registered sex offenders, and people around them are none the wiser about what kind of history they have had. 'Until they resolve it and handle it properly, this is not going to go away.'","Elisha Morrow and three other young recruits were subject to extreme sexual harassment at a boot camp in Cape May, New Jersey, in 2009-10 .

But when the power supply fails, it switches to an using a rechargeable battery so that power outages are not as disruptive. The device was invented by Mr Suman, 52, from North Carolina after he became frustrated that he couldn't find a torch during a power cut at his home. The bulb works like a normal bulb and uses an everyday light switch but when the power goes out, it continues to light up. It is filled with technology (pictured) so that it can continue to work without mains power . When the power supply fails, Shailendra Suman's SmartCharge bulb  switches to an LED bulb with a rechargeable battery so that power outages are not as obvious. He is pictured here with his battery-operated bulb . To solve the problem, he researched and designed his SmartCharge bulb, which can be pre-ordered for $35 each (£21) or $40, (£24) with international shipping and are estimated to be delivered in April. ‘About three years ago, we could not find the torch during a power cut. I then thought that having a light bulb which works during a power cut would be convenient and cool,’ Mr Suman said. ‘I researched the net and there was nothing available in market except some standalone emergency lights or backup generators for commercial applications. ‘This is the first of its kind. This bulb works like a normal bulb and uses the normal light switch but when the power goes out, it continues to light up.’ He explained that the bulb can be turned on and off from the same wall switch during a power failure. The bulb has an intelligent control circuit with grid and switch sensor technology, a rechargeable battery with charging circuit and an inverter, he said. The bulb has a battery, control technology, intelligence, CPU, memory, inverter, and a printed circuit board inside (pictured) to make it smart and efficient, SmartCharge said . ‘The bulb also houses a CPU, memory and a printed circuit board to make it smart and efficient,’ he added. ‘After a power failure, bulb will stay on for four hours continuous use and it can be used almost anywhere. ‘On top of that there is no change in wiring required or any extra hardware needed -all people need to do is simply change their existing bulb.’ Mr Suman is currently raising funds to manufacture his SmartCharge bulb on crowd funding website Kickstarter and has pulled in $91,804 – more than the $50,000 he set out to raise.

People who have been abused, abandoned and neglected often struggle to identify kind facial expressions so that a smile can seem like a threat. But now a new type of therapy has been developed to help those suffering from anxiety or depression who find it difficult to connect with others. The ‘compassion game’ trains people to recognise kindness and compassion in a bid to desensitise patients and rid them of threatening feelings in response to seeing kind faces. A scientist from Cardiff University developed the 'compassion game' to train people suffering from depression or anxiety to recognise kindness in a bid to rid them of threatening feelings in response to seeing kind faces. To play, the person has to pick out the compassionate face from the more critical faces . People with attachment disorders can harbour highly self-critical attitudes and can feel threatened by compassionate facial expressions, often responding with fear or grief. This can have crippling consequences for patients’ recovery, leaving them struggling to form meaningful relationships with other people and relate to their environment. Dr Kirsten McEwan from Cardiff University’s School of Medicine developed a set of facial expressions to assess the degree to which individuals who are highly self-critical, anxious or depressed may struggle to process and receive compassion. While studying for her PhD at the University of Derby, she found that found that individuals who were highly self-criticical did indeed struggle to process and pay attention to compassionate emotions and she believes this could be a factor in mood disorders and a block to therapy. She developed a ‘compassion game’ that trains individuals to recognise kindness and compassion. Participants search for a compassionate face among a number of critical faces, which retrains the automatic, unconscious biases towards threatening stimuli commonly shown by people with mood disorders, according to the study published in Plos One journal. People who were abused as children are twice as likely to suffer from depression, according to a 2011 study. They are also less likely to respond to depression treatments. Scientists examined data from 26 separate studies involving more than 23,000 participants. The research was carried out by a team from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London. Lead . investigator Dr Andrea Danese, said: 'Childhood maltreatment is . associated both with an increased risk of developing recurrent and . persistent episodes of depression, and with an increased risk of . responding poorly to treatment. 'Therefore, . prevention and early therapeutic interventions targeting childhood . maltreatment could prove vital in helping prevent the major health . burden owing to depression. 'Knowing . that individuals with a history of maltreatment won't respond as well . to treatment may also be valuable for clinicians in determining . patients' prognosis.' One in 10 children worldwide are exposed to maltreatment including psychological, physical or sexual abuse or neglect. People with attachment disorders can harbour highly self-critical attitudes and can feel threatened by compassionate facial expressions, often responding with fear or grief. Here, a set of images used within the game show a man with a neutral, compassionate and critical expression . ‘We found that the more self-critical participants were, the less able they were to find kind and compassionate faces when amongst an array of more critical expressions,’ Dr McEwan said. ‘Conversely, participants of a less self-critical disposition demonstrated an enhanced awareness of kind faces,’ she added. Participants in the study played the ‘compassion game’ alongside a control game for two weeks. Dr McEwan said: ‘We found significant improvements across a variety of self-reported wellbeing outcome measures including self-criticism, depression, anxiety and stress. The aim of the game is to desensitise patients to compassionate images and rid them of threatening feelings.’ While the game is not currently readily available online, there are plans to make it available in the not too distant future. The inspiration for the research came from anecdotal evidence taken from clinicians at Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, who observed that difficulties in processing the emotions of others were a big hindrance to patient recovery. Dr McEwan said that Matt Damon's character in the film Good Will Hunting (pictured) shows the problem of a person who is struggling to come to terms with an abuse-filled past and who rejects therapy and friendship from those outside his own friendship circle . Dr McEwan said that Matt Damon’s character in the film Good Will Hunting shows the problem of a person who is struggling to come to terms with an abuse-filled past - and rejects therapy and friendship from those outside his own friendship circle. There is increasing evidence to show that the ability to process compassion from others triggers the release of natural chemicals such as endorphins and opiates which aides a significant reduction in anxiety, depression and self-criticism and regulates how threatened patients feel during therapy. ‘The NHS is currently grappling with the challenge of making unprecedented efficiency savings whilst improving the nation’s mental health, Dr McEwan said. ‘This computer-based intervention offers the potential to deliver a cheap and easily accessible treatment for depression and anxiety in a non-stigmatising environment.’","A scientist from Cardiff University created the ‘compassion game’ to train people to recognise kindness and compassion .

She . recounted the terrifying moment she was robbed, forced to strip naked, . carjacked and passed between men - an attack prosecutors claim . stemmed from her sexuality. 'You like men now, don't you? Tell me you like men,' Salvador uttered after he started attacking her, the woman said. She explained that she screamed 'yes' as she feared for her life. Salvador has been convicted of 15 felonies including kidnapping, carjacking and gang rape in the December 13, 2008 attack. Salvador did not react when he was convicted, except to glance at his crying mother. Police . have said the rape served as a turning point for people in the . community to come forward to them and help prevent gang violence in the . area. ‘I think the case really galvanized people into the idea that enough is enough,’ Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus told the Contra Costa Times. ‘It . really touched a lot of people, and I think as awful as that crime was, . there was a positive that came out of it, and that's a sense that a . community can come together to not only provide tips but also to rally . behind a victim in need of support. He was joined that night by fellow gang members Josue Gonzalez - the only one not accused of sexual assault - and Darrell Hodges. A third member, Robert Ortiz, is also alleged to have been present. Targeted: He was allegedly joined by three other men in approaching her on her street in Richmond, California (pictured), where he robbed her, smashed her over the head with a flashlight and made her strip naked . Defence lawyers said during the trial that, while . there was no doubt the rape occurred, they were seeking to prove that . it was not motivated by the woman's sexual orientation. In court, the victim described how she arrived home in Richmond from her job at a pizzeria around 9.30pm when she was approached by a man, who demanded her purse and keys. Photos of the woman's car show it was . marked with emblems of her sexuality, including rainbow stickers . symbolising gay pride and a rainbow-colored teddy bear on the dashboard. Attack: Josue Gonzalez did not rape the woman but pleaded guilty to carjacking and robbery . She said that Salvador then smashed her across the head with a flashlight and showed . the jury the scar that is still visible beneath her short hair. As jurors wiped away their tears, the woman testified that the man forced her to strip naked on the sidewalk. 'He kept insisting and asking whether or not I liked men,' she said through a Spanish interpreter, adding: 'I thought he would kill me.' He proceeded to rape her until the other men warned that people might be coming. They got into her car where Salvador continued to assault her, she said. They drove to an abandoned apartment building near the Richmond BART and, after he was done, he turned to the other men and told them it was their turn, the victim said. Hodges, 20, was sentenced to 24 years in prison earlier this month after admitting to forcible oral copulation. Ortiz, meanwhile, is awaiting trial. Gonzalez, 26, is awaiting sentence after he pleaded guilty to carjacking. After the attack, the victim testified . that she was left naked in a carport and waited until they were gone before running to the closest house with a light on. The residents called 911. The prosecutor said Salvador's semen was recovered from the victim's body and his palm print was found in the victim's blood on the flashlight. Salvador is to be sentenced on February 21.

Staff at Bristol Airport have identified the owner of this 100-year-old teddy bear as Nicholas James Baker, who died during World War One in Baghdad . The owner of a a 100-year-old teddy bear found abandoned at an airport has finally been identified. The antique bear, which has one eye and a floppy ear, was found last year in a bag with a frayed black and white photo, dated March 1918, of him being cuddled by two little girls. Unlike Paddington Bear, the toy had no name tag but a message in faded ink on the back of the picture read: 'With dearest love and kisses to our darling Daddie from your loving little daughters Dora and Glyn.' Staff at Bristol Airport made a public appeal to try and trace the owner earlier this year and have now identified ‘Daddie’ as Nicholas James Baker. He was killed during World War One in Baghdad just a month after the picture was taken and was buried in a military cemetery there with full honours. The children referred to are Dora and Glyn Baker from the Abergavenny area of south Wales, who were writing a postcard to their father. But despite identifying the family airport staff are yet to trace any living relatives and are appealing for anyone who knows the Baker family to come forward. Jacqui Mills, airport spokeswoman, said: 'We gained a lot of interest once we went out with the story we had found the bear. 'We had bear historians, photographic historians and ancestral forums come forward to help. The bear was found last year in a bag with a frayed black and white photo, dated March 1918, of him being cuddled by two little girls . 'Using all the information we had we managed to identify the family in the photograph and trace ""Daddie"" as Nicholas James Baker. 'The only problem we have is that we have not had any living relatives come forward to claim the bear. 'We would love to find them and reunite them with this lovely bear.' Staff at Bristol Airport spent 14 months trawling flight records to see if they could find any two passengers with the same names as those mentioned on the back of the picture. When they could not, they appealed for help from the public and a number of experts stepped forward to help with the search. They were able to trace the date of the picture after they discovered a second message on the image, which said: 'taken on Baby’s birthday March 4th 1918, one year and five-months-old.' A message in faded ink on the back of the picture (left) read: 'With dearest love and kisses to our darling Daddie from your loving little daughters Dora and Glyn'. Right picture shows Poppy Barlass, 5, (left) and sister Olivia Barlass, 3, with the antique teddy bear which was found at Bristol Airport . The children referred to are Dora and Glyn Baker from the Abergavenny area of south Wales, who were writing a postcard to their father . A studio name was also left on the photo and from there experts tracked the picture to Wales and managed to track Dora and Glyn. But, despite tracing the girls, they have now drawn a blank and are once more calling for help to return the bear - named ‘Bristol’ by staff - to his rightful owner. Hilary Kaye, BBC Antiques Roadshow expert, said she thought the bear was made by the British manufacturer Farnells, and was the type that inspired the Winnie the Pooh stories. 'It would be a lovely Christmas present if the teddy in the photograph could go back to his rightful family,' Ms Mills said. Despite identifying the family, airport staff are yet to trace any living relatives and are appealing for anyone who knows the Baker family to come forward . 'We honestly, genuinely believed somebody would come forward and claim him. 'A lot of our passengers do go off for one or two months so it’s not unusual to have something in lost property for a while, but then nothing happened. 'We’re appealing for the family to come forward. So many more people study their own history and family trees now.

Two of the most successful food brands in recent years are to part company, as Whole Foods Market announced it is to stop stocking Chobani early next year. As Whole Foods moves towards more organic and GMO-free produce, it has decided to no longer offer the popular Greek yogurt. With more organic versions now available, Chobani, which uses milk from cows fed with GMO food, appears to be less in line with the store's philosophy. Fresh approach: Whole Foods says it will no longer stock Chobani as it moves towards more organic Greek yogurt options . 'Whole Foods Market challenged its . Greek yogurt suppliers to create unique options for shoppers to enjoy - . including exclusive flavors, non-GMO options and organic choices,' the store said in a statement. It added that Chobani, which produces 30 million cups of yogurt a week, had 'chosen a different business model' meaning it will be phased out early next year 'to make room for product choices that aren't readily available'. Kevin Perkins, a Morningstar analyst, told ABC: 'As consumers spend more money with a . handful of retailers, these retailers have more leverage to lean on . suppliers for lower prices, different packaging. This may be one . such example.' Being stocked by Whole Foods was just part of Chobani's success story as the company, founded by a Turkish immigrant, quickly rose to become a billion-dollar industry. 'They have been a wonderful and an . important partner of ours over the years,' the company, run by Hamdi Ulukaya, said. Taste of success: Chobani was started by a Turkish immigrant in 2005 who wanted to offer nutritious and easily accessible yogurt . 'As the number one Greek yogurt brand in America using only natural . ingredients, we share an affinity with Whole Foods and its shoppers,' the statement said. While none of the non-dairy ingredients in Chobani have been genetically modified, it is hard for the company, and others like it, to find animal feed that is GMO free. In July the company said it would be a challenge to find an economical and GMO-free way to feed the more than 78,000 cows kept at 875 farms around its plants. More than 90 per cent of the soy and corn grown in the U.S. and used for animal feeds come from genetically engineered seeds. However, with Chobani keen for its product to be available to the masses, being dropped by Whole Foods, which has about 360 stores in the U.S. and UK, won't be too big a set back. Mr Ulukaya told the New York Times: 'The foundation of my business model and my philosophy is that we are going to make yogurt that is delicious, nutritious and accessible to everyone.' The immigrant, who came up with the idea of Chobani in 2005, added: 'When . I came here I couldnâ€™t understand why in order to find good-tasting . yogurt you have to go to some specialty store to find it.'","Grocery chain says it wants customers to have more GMO-free options .

Two American astronauts will be sent into space this weekend on an urgent mission to repair a broken cooling line that led to the shutdown of several systems at the International Space Station. Four spacewalks are necessary to replace the pump with a bad valve, NASA said on Wednesday. But after a spacewalking astronaut nearly drowned in his helmet in July, the space agency has devised a plan to protect its crew when in space: snorkels . Scroll down for video . Space mission: Two American astronauts will be sent into space this weekend on an urgent mission to repair a broken cooling line (file photo) Near death: Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano nearly drowned in July, when more than a gallon of water leaked into his helmet, filling it like a fishbowl . Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano nearly drowned in July, when more than a gallon of water leaked into his helmet, filling it like a fishbowl, according to Fox News. NASA says it is now ready should a similar incident happen again. ‘Some smart engineers on the ground said, hey, this looks like a snorkel you’d use for scuba diving,’ explained Allison Bolinger, NASA's lead U.S. spacewalk officer. NASA realized that a water-line vent tube could be snipped down and attached with Velcro within the spacesuit, between a water restraint valve and the astronaut. ‘This is your last resort … if water is in your suit you can lean down and use this to breathe,’ Bolinger said. The space agency also installed . absorptive pads in the back of each helmet, which will soak up any water . that shows up like a sponge. The . spacewalkers have been trained to tilt their heads back periodically to . test the pad, she said; if it sucks up around 6 and a half ounces of . water, it will feel “squishy” -- a sure sign of trouble. ‘That’s a sign there is a problem in the EMU and it’s time to come inside,’ Bolinger said. Rescue mechanism: Allison Bolinger, NASA's lead U.S. spacewalk officer, says the snorkel is the last resort for the astronauts should they get water in their suit . The solutions sound makeshift but the situation is real, though the faulty pump is far from life-threatening, according to Fox. Astronaut Rick Mastracchio said last week that the station's navigation, lights, toilet and other vital systems still work. The failed cooling unit is largely affecting the astronauts ability to do science aboard the orbiting space base, explained Dina Contella, ISS flight director. The space station cooling system, which runs ammonia through the lines, is critical for dispelling heat generated by on-board equipment - mainly science projects at present. ‘The pump is actually running, but can’t integrate with internal water loop,’ Contella said. ‘We’re running cold, that’s the issue. We want to be able to close the valve and we can’t do it.’ When half of the station's cooling system shut down last Wednesday, it forced the six-man crew to turn off all nonessential equipment, including some science experiments. Because of the valve failure, one of the two cooling lines became too cold. Space station: The failed cooling unit is largely affecting the astronauts ability to do science aboard the orbiting space base, which is why two spacewalkers are being sent out there to replace the fault valve . While the astronauts are safe and comfortable, NASA wants the system back up to full strength, in case of another failure that could leave the orbiting outpost even more vulnerable than it is right now. Flight controllers tried in vain to fix the valve remotely, then came up with a plan to use another valve to regulate the temperature. Some success was reported, and for a while, engineers thought the space station could limp along with the short-term solution. Instead managers have opted for spacewalks right now. ‘It’ll take about three [spacewalks], it could be less if we get lucky … or more if we’re not lucky,’ said Mike Suffredini, International Space Station program manager. This is the same pump that was replaced by a pair of spacewalking astronauts in 2010, although different things malfunctioned at the time -- that was the pump itself, now it’s just a valve. But three spacewalks were needed then as well. Potential danger: Mike Hopkins, one of the astronauts to be sent into space this weekend, will be wearing the very same suit that nearly flooded on spacewalker Parmitano . Mastracchio and astronaut Michael Hopkins trained for just such a repair before rocketing into orbit. They have been prepping all week, just in case of just such a decision. The potential risk of a flooded space helmet is very real, however; in fact, Mike Hopkins will be wearing the very same suit that nearly flooded on spacewalker Parmitano. NASA has scrubbed the suit, added new parts to it, notably a fan pump separator, and considers it as good as a brand new one. ‘We think that’s an extremely clean suit and it's ready to go,’ Bolinger said. ‘We have high confidence that it’s essentially just like a unit that was refurbished on the ground.’","Two American astronauts will be sent into space this weekend on an urgent mission to repair a broken cooling line .

Restaurant owners across the country have been stocking up on Sriracha after learning that the hot sauce plant will remain closed through mid-January. Last week, the state of California ordered Huy Fong Foods to halt production at its Irwindale plant for 30 days, citing a new rule enforced by the Department of Public Health that requires a 30-day hold on the product, to ensure that bacteria isn't gathering in the bottles. But while the company has claimed that there is enough hot sauce in stock to last until mid-January, when the factory reopens, Sriracha enthusiasts are taking no chances. Sriracha lovers are stocking up after the state of California ordered Huy Fong Foods to halt production temporarily, citing a new rule that requires a 30-day hold to ensure that bacteria isn't gathering in the bottles . Jennifer Saesue, general manager of OBAO Hell’s Kitchen, told DNAinfo: 'We've stocked up since a couple weeks ago, when we got word of a possible impending shortage.' She claims that she has enough Sriracha at the New York restaurant to last another three months, just in case. And Kristine Mana-ay, executive chef of The Windsor in the West Village, said she was very disheartened to learn of the factory closure. She goes through about two dozen 12-ounce bottles of Sriracha a week, and uses it for her popular chicken wing recipe. 'One of my friends told me about it and I was like, ""Oh no! Why? Oh my God! I'm gonna die!""' she said. 'I am concerned. People will be crushed - it's our most-used condiment' For Ben Thach, who works at Kim Son Vietnemese restaurant in Houston, Texas - where customers go through around 100 bottles of Sriracha a week - the shortage could mean trouble for business. 'I am concerned,' he told the Chron. 'People will be crushed, it's our most-used condiment.' According to Health department . spokeswoman Anita Gore, 'Holding products for a period of time at a . specified pH level is one method of controlling those microorganisms.' Once the Huy Fong factory is given the green light, it can resume production of its popular rooster sauce. According to Health department spokeswoman Anita Gore, 'Holding products for a period of time at a specified pH level is one method of controlling those microorganisms' This isn't the first time hot sauce fans have lived in fear of a Sriracha shortage, or #Srirachapocalypse, as it was nicknamed on Twitter. In November, Huy Fong was ordered to stop production on a partial basis after residents who lived near the factory complained of noxious odors. 'We've stocked up since a couple weeks ago, when we got word of a possible impending shortage' Irwindale residents sued the company, claiming that the spicy smells emanating from the hot sauce plant were resulting in various health risks including asthma, heartburn and nosebleeds. In November, a judged ordered Huy Fong to stop producing the odors until air-quality experts could determine how to mitigate them. But not everyone has suffered from this hot sauce setback. Lisa Kartzman, a spokeswoman for Roland Foods, which produces its own version of Sriracha sauce, says the temporary shutdown will be good for her own business. 'You don't wish this on anyone,' she told DNAinfo, 'but certainly it's opened doors for us and we expect that to continue.'",Huy Fong Foods's popular Sriracha hot sauce has become a beloved condiment in restaurants across the country in recent years .

Sickening: Sales of the t-shirts have grown, despite the fact he was identified as one of Britain's worst sex criminals by a judge . Twisted fans of paedophile rock star Ian Watkins are still buying his Mega Lolz T-shirts just 24 hours after he was sentenced to 35 years in prison for depraved child sex crimes. Watkins, who was yesterday beginning his lengthy jail term, used the slogan, to describe his horrific offences in a phone call he made from prison. But the merchandise branded with the catchphrase was selling out online, despite his recent conviction for a string of sickening sex offences. The infamous t-shirts were sold out on internet retailer Amazon yesterday - after going on sale just months . before his arrest in December last year. There was only on auction website eBay, selling for Â£15.20, while all sizes except large had been snapped up on rock merchandise website Grindstore. The lead singer of the rock band made the phrase famous by selling t-shirts with the slang term - which means 'laugh out loud'. Watkins, who studied graphic design before he began his music career, designed the clothing as well as the artwork and merchandise for his band. In a phone call to a fan made from prison he said: 'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was Mega Lolz. 'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.' The frontman, who has sold more than 3.5 million records, launched his own clothing line called Made In Hell in 2008. At the time he said: 'Over the years, I've been approached by various people and companies about starting my own clothing line, and I've always said: ""No"". 'Do we really need another guy in a band selling crap t-shirts just to pump up his ego? It seemed a bit cliche.

It sold out with fans saying they were going to wear the T-shirt to support the singer at his trial. Watkins was jailed for 35 years after admitting sexually abusing two infants and attempting to rape an 11-month-old baby boy. The two mothers who gave up their children for the rock star to abuse, named Woman A and Woman B to protect their children's identities, were jailed for 17 and 14 years.

The Tomohon Traditional market in North Sulawesi, Indonesia sells whole monkeys, bats, cats, dogs, pigs, rats, sloths and even giant pythons laid out on tables with painful expressions still etched on their faces. The macabre food stalls were witnessed by Oman-based photographer and blogger, Raymond Walsh, 44, who said it was easier to witness the dead and mutilated animals than it was to see the living dogs in cages awaiting their fate. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Awaiting their fate: These dogs are kept in cramped cages for hours before they are eventually hung by a rope and flame roasted whole at a meat market in Indonesia . Grisly: The blackened bodies of dozens of dogs sit on a table in Tomohon Traditional market in North Sulawesi . Brutal: The dogs' flame-roasted bodies are curled up on a floor covered in blood at the Indonesian market . Sad: Not only is this dog likely to be turned into meat, it is also chained to the floor of a cramped cage, leaving it barely able to move in the hours before its death . Bloody: Most of the killing and butchery at the market takes place in view of the public. The result is harrowing . Mr Walsh said: 'It was typical of a lot of local markets in the developing world - lots of fruit, vegetables and fish. The only difference was the sheer number of dead animals for sale.' On his blog www.manonthelam.com, he describes the harrowing sight of dogs in cages with their dead counterparts lying on a table nearby. 'It was easier to stomach the entrails of monkeys, rats on a stick and decapitated pigs than it was to see those live dogs awaiting their fate,' he said.

Scary: These terrifying and charred remains of a bat will be used in traditional Indonesian cooking . Mr Walsh said Tomohon was typical of a lot of local markets in the developing world with lots of fruit, vegetables and fish. The only difference was the sheer number of dead animals for sale, including these rats . The Oman-based professional photographer said he found the sight of dead dogs particularity harrowing . Would you eat one? Roasted rats are piled up on a table inside Tomohon Traditional market in Indonesia . Skewered: The rats are flame-roasted on sticks after being killed by having their heads thumped against a tree . Although the market's dead dogs may be difficult for westerners to look at, Mr Walsh points to the different cultures and attitudes towards the animals in South East Asia. 'Put simply, Westerners see dogs solely as pets. Indonesians see them as both pets and as sources of meat - it's just how we're raised,' he said.

'After they are killed the animals are roasted over a fire, so the fur burns off, the skin tightens and peels back, causing that 'screaming' look,' Mr Walsh explained. 'How they are killed depends on the animal. Cats, monkeys, and sloths are shot. Bats and rats have their heads clobbered against a tree or table.

The husband of a woman who went missing 13 years ago has set up a new tip line in hopes of solving her disappearance as he prepares to face his third murder trial in connection to the case. Michele Harris was last seen on September 11, 2011, leaving her waitressing job in Waverly, New York - a rural Upstate town. Though her body was never found, husband Cal Harris, of Spencer, New York, was arrested and charged with her murder in 2005. Looking for mom: Cal Harris and his four teenage children renewed the search for his wife Michele, who went missing 13 years ago as he prepares for his third murder trial in connection to the case . Memories of mom: Michele Harris was last seen leaving her job as a waitress on September 11, 2001. Her children were between two and 7-years-old at the time of her disappearance and are now all in their teens . Where did she go? Cal Harris was arrested for wife Michele's murder even though her body was never found . Harris, 52, has twice been convicted of killing his wife, but had both judgements thrown out on appeal. This new push for information comes as he prepares to start his third murder trial, set for September. 'I did not have any involvement in Michele's disappearance,' Harris said at the Wednesday press conference. 'I would never hurt the mother of my children and I would never do anything to hurt them.' Harris recently hired a new legal defense team as well as investigators with cold case experience to find answers to Michele's mysterious disappearance. Cal's four children, who were between two and 7-years-old when their mom disappeared, are the reason for this renewed search. Both Cal Harris (left) and his eldest daughter Cayla, 18 (right), spoke at the Wednesday press conference . 'Up until now I have tried to shield my children from the public's eye and the fire storm of media coverage that has surrounded this case,' Harris said, 'however they have reached the age where they understand what's going on and want answers for themselves.' The Harris' eldest daughter Cayla, 18, spoke at the press conference herself. 'We need to know what really happened to our mother,"" Cayla Harris said. 'We know our dad had nothing to do with her disappearance, we also know there are people out there with information that can help us get answers. 'We want to keep our family together and not lose our father again. We plead to those of you who can help us, to please come forward with information,' the teen added. All grown up: Cal Harris says he tried to shield his children from the media attention surrounding their mother's disappearance but they're now old enough to demand answers themselves . The tip-line number is 607-215-5166 and since it was given to the media, investigators say they've received seven phone calls. Harris' attorney Bruce Barket says they've already started focusing on a small group of potential suspects that are 'interesting to us'. 'We've developed some information about them and that information continues to grow. We've waited til now to do this tip line, because we're kind of at a critical point where we think the influx of new information will hopefully put us over the top,' Mr Barket said.","Michele Harris went missing in Upstate New York on September 11, 2001 .

The mother of the 29-year-old man charged with killing missing nursing student Holly Bobo, says Bobo's mother Karen was her son's fourth grade teacher. Zachary Adams was was officially charged with first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping Wednesday, following a search of his property in Holladay, Tennessee over the weekend. Authorities believe Adams is responsible for the disappearance of 20-year-old Holly Bobo, who was last seen being led into the woods behind her home with a man wearing all camouflage in April 2011. Mrs Bobo: The mother of Holly Bobo murder-suspect Zachary Adams, 29 (left), says Bobo's mother Karen (right) was her son's fourth-grade teacher.

A woman at Scotts Hill Elementary School told a local news station today that Mrs Bobo had worked there for 27 years . What happened? Holly Bobo was last seen by her brother in April 2011, being led by a man in all camouflage into the woods behind her house . Tennessee Bureau of Investigation authorities haven't yet revealed what they believe connects Adams to Bobo, but his mother Cindy spoke about her son's elementary school connection to Karen Bobo with WTVF on Wednesday. The Decatur County Board of Education would not say whether Mrs Bobo ever had Adams as a student, but a woman at Scotts HIll Elementary School said the missing girl's mother was employed there for 27 years. According to public records, Adams' mother was also a teacher in Decator County, but has since moved to Georgia. While her son may have had Karen Bobo as a teacher, that's the only connection Cindy Adams knows between the two. New tips: Authorities started searching Adams' property last weekend  after he was arrested on unrelated charges. On Wednesday, Adams was formally charged with the first-degree murder and especially aggravated assault of Holly Bobo . She says her 29-year-old son didn't run in the same circles as Holly Bobo, who would have been 23 this year. After her son's initial arrest Friday on charged of aggravated assault, Cindy Adams described Zachary as 'one of the sweetest people', but said he had changed after getting 'mixed up with drugs at an early age'. Cindy also told WZTZ that her other son Dylan, who has been behind bars since July, was questioned in connection with the Bobo case. 'I asked him, ""Did you get interrogated?"" He said, ""Yeah mom I did. They kept me up all night asking me all these questions about Zachary and Holly,""' Cindy Adams said . Investigators say more arrests may come in the case, so there is a possibility that Dylan is also a suspect. 'I am not saying that either one of them is innocent. I am just saying that as their mother, I am going to believe my children until proven otherwise,' the mother added.

Wednesday afternoon, District Attorney Hansel McAdams announced that a grand jury had indicted Adams on charges of first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. McAdams would not say whether Bobo's body was found on Adams' property. Adams is being held without bond and will be formally arraigned in court on Tuesday. At a Wednesday press conference, TBI Director Mark Gwyn says members of staff and the FBI spoke with the Bobo family after the indictment, and says they were torn up over the news.

Darnell says she told police that Bobo encountered Adams and friends out on a racoon hunt a week before her disappearance. 'Holly was on stage and walking around the coon hunt and they basically followed, stalked her a bit,' Darnell told WBBJ. 'Karen [Bobo] even went up and introduced herself as Holly's mom.' Darnell . says Adams made a few comments about Bobo in the past year to close . friends, and that she and others reported the comments to the TBI. 'I do believe he is involved along with three others. I just know from things I've heard,' she said. Where is Holly? The search on Saturday seemed to focus on an abandoned building and well across the street from Adams' house . TBI Director Gwyn held a press conference when they started searching Adam's property last week, and confirmed that they were searching the Holladay, Tennessee property in connection with Bobo's disappearance - though Adams was at the time arrested on unrelated charges.

He has hurt his grandparents and a lot of people around here in different ways,' Ann LaMance said. High: Neighbors have described Adams as a drug user. Before his arrest on Friday for aggravated assault, he was booked earlier in the week for a drug charge .

Close: Adams' house is located approximately 15 minutes from where Bobo went missing . His house is located approximately 15 minutes from Bobo's home on Swan Johnson Road where she was last seen. Locals say Bible Hill Road closely connects both Swan Johnson Road and Adams lane. On Saturday the search seemed to focus on an abandoned building and what appeared to be a well on the property across the street.

Osama bin Laden's son-in-law urged recruits to pledge their lives to the al-Qaeda leader a few months before 9/11, a court was told on Thursday. Suleiman Abu Ghaith rallied al-Qaeda recruits as they made their way to a training camp in Afghanistan, a government witness told jurors. Sahim Alwan, 41, of Lackawanna, New York, testified in federal court in New York that Abu Ghaith spoke to the recruits months before the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. On trial: A sketch shows Suleiman Abu Ghaith, left, who is in court charged with conspiring to kill Americans . Abu Ghaith is on trial for conspiring to kill Americans. Alwan said he was at a training camp in spring, 2001 and saw Abu Ghaith one night at a guest house in Kandahar, urging several men to provide a 'bayat', or pledge to bin Laden. He said he was already having second thoughts about joining al-Qaeda, but he stayed in Afghanistan long enough to meet Osama bin Laden, who asked him what American Muslims thought about suicide bombers. Prosecutors say Abu Ghaith, 48, was a critical al-Qaeda spokesman and recruiter after the September 11, 2001 attacks. He is one of the highest-ranking figures linked to al-Qaeda to face a civilian jury on terrorism-related charges since the attacks. His lawyer has said there is no evidence against him. Alwan was arrested in 2002 and ultimately sentenced to 9 and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He was released from prison in July 2010 after agreeing to cooperate with the government in another investigation, and is now in the cell phone business, he said. Connection: An undated photo shows Abu Ghaith, left, with his father-in-law Osama bin Laden . Claims: Abu Ghaith, pictured right, with bin Laden, is alleged to have been a top al-Qaeda recruiter . Alwan recognized an old picture of Abu Ghaith, but could not definitively identify him when a prosecutor asked Alwan to stand and identify anyone in the courtroom he remembered from Afghanistan. 'I can't say 100 percent for sure,' he said, after looking at Abu Ghaith. After the incident in spring 2001, Alwan said he never saw Abu Ghaith again except on television after the September 11 attacks. Alwan described a journey that began in a Lackawanna mosque and included a motorcycle ride into Afghanistan from Pakistan. Once in the Kandahar guesthouse, he had second thoughts after seeing a video of the 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole. 'I knew at that time I was in way over my head,' he said. Alwan also said he met bin Laden three times, the last being a chilling one-on-one sit-down at another guesthouse Alwan stayed at on his way out of Afghanistan. Bin Laden asked how American Muslims felt about suicide bombings and how they were treated in the U.S, Alwan said. Alwan replied that they were 'more free' than in some Muslim countries. Rally: A witness claims Abu Ghaith urged recruits to pledge their lives to bin Laden in the months leading up to 9/11 . 'He kind of smiled,' Alwan said. Bin Laden then asked: 'Do you need us to clean your passport?' Abu Ghaith's attorneys will cross-examine Alwan on Monday. Another government witness, Saajid Badat, is also expected to testify on Monday from Britain via video feed. Badat plotted with Richard Reid, the man who became known as the shoe bomber after his attempt to detonate explosives on a flight to Miami in 2002. Also on Thursday, David Karnes, a soldier who said he was in the first team of U.S. Army special forces in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks, testified that his group confiscated a coded card with bin Laden and Abu Ghaith's name on it. Prosecutors have said that card suggests Abu Ghaith was among the top tier of al-Qaeda leadership. Prosecutors say Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti imam, spent time in Afghanistan with bin Laden soon after the attacks and recorded several statements threatening further attacks against Americans, including one that said 'the storm of airplanes will not stop'. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over Abu Ghaith's trial, told sketch artists on Wednesday that they were not allowed to draw Karnes, 41.

Anyone who has ever received a dubious fortelling in a fortune cookie, take heed: A Bronx woman who used her lucky numbers, according to the cookie, has won $2 million. Emma Duvoll, 75, dined out in Manhattan Chinese restaurant Sammy's Noodle Shop & Grill and cracked open her sweet end-of-meal treat to reveal five lucky numbers. She used the numbers when purchasing a Powerball ticket for the February 1 draw for $193 million. Look to the cookie: Emma Duvoll won $2 million after playing numbers she received in a fortune cookie . NBC reports that Duvoll bought the ticket in Pine Bush and realized the day after the draw that she'd won. 'I was surprised but pleased,' she told lottery officials. The grandmother of eight and great-grandother of one told the New York Post she plays Powerball about once a month. Duvoll was born in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. with her husband, Dwight, 86. The pair raised two sons and owned a delicatessen in the Bronx. The couple were watching at home when Duvoll's numbers came in. Bright future: She's planning to invest some of the money and use the rest to travel . Duvoll had managed to match the five numbers but had missed out on the Powerball. The cookie's recommended numbers were 5, 12, 15, 27 and 38. Matching five numbers automatically won Duvoll $1 million but she had chosen the Power Play option, which doubled her winnings. Duvoll will receive a one-time payment of $1,246,085 after all required taxes. She was in Manhattan Thursday, along with several other New York winners, to receive her prize. 'I took some time contemplating what I will do with the money,' Duvall said. 'I plan to invest most of it, and maybe take a trip to Switzerland to visit family.' Employees at Sammy's Noodle Shop told the New York Post that they're all now believers in the cookie.","Emma Duvoll, 75, used number she received in a fortune cookie to enter the Powerball lottery .

He blamed his bad game on the NBA's new short sleeved fashion. James shot 6-of-18 during the game, setting the record for his second-worst shooting night of the season. 'Iâ€™m not making excuses, but Iâ€™m not a big fan of the jerseys,' James told reporters following the loss. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

'Every time I shoot it feels like it's just pulling right up underneath my arm. I already don't have much room for error on my jump shot. It's definitely not a good thing.' The short-sleeved jerseys were introduced to the NBA this season and are flying off the shelves of stores as they are very popular with fans, reports ESPN. James is not a fan of the jerseys and told reporters that it affects his long range shots. James alluded to a game on Christmas Day when he wore one of the short-sleeved jerseys and shot 0-of-4 from a 3-point-range in a game with the Los Angeles Lakers. Thursday was a night of mishaps for LeBron who later took off the plastic mask he wears to protect his broken nose because it 'bothered him.' 'I don't like it,' James said.

As for the short sleeved jerseys, LeBron wasn't the only player to complain about the restrictive style. However, the NBA disputes that shooting percentages are the same regardless of whether a person is wearing a short sleeved jersey or not. 'We know that shooting percentages are virtually exactly the same for games in which we have sleeved jerseys and teams in which the guys are wearing conventional jerseys,' NBA commissioner Adam Silver said over All-Star Weekend. 'So I'm pretty comfortable from a competitive standpoint that it's having no impact.' James is done wearing the short sleeved Jerseys this season and is pretty thrilled about it but knows there will be a game in the future for which he'll have to wear the Jersey. 'I have to figure something out the next time I have to wear them,' James said.

Deep-sea explorers can now recover the remaining gold from a ship that sank off the South Carolina coast in 1857 and more recently has been embroiled in legal fights involving a fugitive treasure hunter. Under the deal, approved by Ohio judge Patrick Sheera, Tampa, Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration can begin working to recover gold bars and coins from the SS Central America next month. 'The SS Central America is one of the greatest shipwreck stories of all time,' Greg Stemm, Odyssey's CEO, said in a statement. 'We're honored to be working with the receiver and his team to share the next chapter of this historically important shipwreck with the world.' An Ohio judge approved a deal to recover the remaining gold from a ship that sank off the Carolina coast in 1857. The ship known as the SS Central America is also known as the Ship of Gold. X-marks the spot: The SS Central America sank during a hurricane off the North Carolina coast in 1857, taking 425 souls and up to 21 tons of gold to the ocean floor . Specialized searchers: In this 2003 photo provided by Odyssey Marine Exploration, the company¿s eight-ton remotely operated vehicle, named Zeus, is launched for a descent to the ocean floor . This is an artist drawing of the U.S. Mail ship SS Central America shown which foundered in 1857 with a loss of 425 lives in a hurricane off Charleston, S.C. Treasure hunters have located the ship on the ocean floor 200 miles off Charleston . Midas touch: Tommy G. Thompson organized an expedition to find the epic ship and recover the treasure in 1983. He found it five years later in 1988 but there's still plenty of treasure down there . Experts hired to conduct a review of extensive historical materials on the shipwreck estimate the 1857 value of the remaining gold on the ship to be somewhere between $343,000 and $1.4 million, according to Odyssey Marine. That range in today's values would be between $22 million and $88 million if the gold were melted down. But the sunken treasure's worth could be much higher — or lower — depending on the type and amount of treasure recovered. For instance, thousands of $10 and $20 gold coins sold by Odyssey Marine from the SS Republic, which sank off the southeastern U.S. in 1865, were sold for an average of about $6,700 per coin, said company spokeswoman Liz Shows. That's in comparison to the current $1,349 value of an ounce of melted gold. Treasures: These gold nuggets, bars and coins from the SS Central America lay on the ocean floor for over 140 years until their recovery in 1987 by U.S. firm Columbus-America Discovery Group . Epic mission: Thompson began searching for the SS Central America in 1983 after reading witness accounts of the shipwreck . The SS Central America was recovered by Ohio-based treasure hunters Columbus America Discovery Group using a remote-controlled submarine in 1987. The group, led by Tommy Thompson, located the wreck using Bayesian search theory, where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost objects. Significant amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote-controlled sub built specifically for the recovery. After the Mr Thompson announced the find, 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold, on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the 19th Century. The team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and, after a legal battle, they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996. The total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $150million. One recovered ingot weighing 80lb sold for a record $8million and was recognized as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time. The expedition to recover the gold isn't the first for the SS Central America. In 1988, shipwreck enthusiast and Ohio native Tommy Thompson led an expedition that found the vessel and recovered gold that later sold for $50 million to $60 million. The treasure then became the subject of lawsuits. The litigation involved a group of Ohio investors who paid $12.7 million to fund Thompson's expedition, but say they never saw any returns and workers who said they weren't properly paid for signing confidentiality agreements to keep the ship's location and other information secret. Thompson has been described as a secretive Howard Hughes-like figure by an attorney on one of the cases. He has been a wanted fugitive since August 2012 after he failed to show up for a key court hearing and was last seen at a mansion he was renting in Vero Beach, Fla. Court records show that Odyssey Marine Exploration will advance the cost for the recovery. If the company fails to recover the treasure, it will absorb all the costs. Financial terms of the agreement were not made public, although court records say that Ohio attorney and businessman Ira Kane, who was appointed receiver over Thompson's companies after he fled, will get more than 50 percent of the recovered treasure, to be disbursed in part to shareholders and the investors who financed the 1988 recovery. 'Rich with historical appeal': The gold ingot which is sold at auction for $150,000 . 'Remember, only 5 percent of this ship was excavated (in 1988),' Kane told The Associated Press on Thursday. ""Obviously we hope that there is substantial value there and that we can return that value to our shareholders and to the creditors. If we can do that after 20-some odd years, I think it'd be a job well done."" Thompson remains a shareholder, although it's unclear how he could claim any of the treasure while he's still a fugitive. 'We're . delighted and we hope this is going to turn out to be a very lucrative . and profitable venture,' said Mike Szolosi, the attorney who represents . scientists and technicians who allowed Thompson to find and recover the . treasure but said they weren't compensated as promised . 'But nobody can tell us with certainty that it will be, and we understand that.' The . SS Central America was in operation for four years during the . California gold rush before it sank after sailing directly into a . hurricane in September 1857 in one of the worst maritime disasters in . American history; 425 people were killed and thousands of pounds of gold . sank with it to the bottom of the ocean.","'Ship of Gold' went down off the coast of North Carolina in 1857 taking 425 souls and a cargo of 21 tons of gold .

'Things just started to get together and I finally got the chance to do the photoshoot to celebrate Chewbacca's 12th birthday,' she added. She recruited her seven-year old nephew Roberto Preciado, 4, to play Darth Vader in the shoot, and his younger brother Matías, 4, to play Han Solo. Ms Preciado says she chose the park in Hermosillo for the shoot because she thinks it resembles the forest moon of Endor in the second Star Wars film 'Return of the Jedi'.

The fire swept through part of a block of . row houses. Authorities recovered two bodies by late morning, and . brought out two other bodies later in the day. Authorities . hadn't released the identities of the dead by Thursday afternoon, but . neighbors and people who said they knew the family said the victims were . a pastor and his wife and children. Before the bodies were found, the . mayor said a couple in their 80s and their two sons, who are in their . 50s, were unaccounted for.

William Pickett often held services at his house and also preached in . Newark and other areas. 'He was just a likable, lovable guy,' Oliver-Fair said. 'This is absolutely devastating. It's a tragic loss for the community.' Authorities haven't said what they believe caused the fire. As stunned neighbors looked on, firefighters used a ladder truck to peer into the second floor of the charred structure. A . man who lives across the street said he had returned home at about 1 . a.m. after celebrating his 40th birthday when he looked out his window . to make sure he'd turned out all the lights in his car.

Publication has been canceled for a planned book based on a popular and anonymous Twitter feed about Goldman Sachs and the financial industry.

'In light of information that has recently come to our attention since acquiring John Lefevre's Straight to Hell, Touchstone has decided to cancel its publication of this work.'

He has been exposed as the fake employee behind the @GSElevator Twitter account which lampoons Wall Street bankers . Touchstone spokesman Brian Belfiglio said the publisher would have no further comment. The Twitter feed, @GSElevator, had hundreds of thousands of followers and purported to offer an inside and irreverent take on the financial giant. But just weeks after Touchstone announced in January that it had reached a deal with the feed's purported author, The New York Times revealed his identity as John Lefevre, a former bond executive who was based in Texas and had never worked for Goldman Sachs, despite earlier public comments that he did. Touchstone initially defended Lefevre, saying that he had not misled them and that publication would continue as planned. But earlier this week, Lefevre posted an open letter on businessinsider.com saying the Twitter account was 'not a person at all. It's the embodiment or aggregation of ""every banker,"" a concentrated reflection of a Wall Street culture and mentality.' The Twitter account was so popular that Goldman Sachs launched an internal inquiry to discover the identity of the indiscreet tweeter . 'The issue of my anonymity was simply a device, and one that has suited the construct of the Twitter feed,' he wrote. 'For the avoidance of any doubt, any person who actually thought my Twitter feed was literally about verbatim conversations overheard in the elevators of Goldman Sachs is an idiot. An agent for Lefevre did not immediately respond to a message left Thursday for comment.

Voters across Britain are flooding their MPs with their concerns at the prospect of Scottish independence, a Cabinet minister will warn today. Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander will attack Alex Salmond’s plan to end the union, calling the Scottish leader ‘a man without a plan.’ He will warn of a long list of potential disasters for the Scots if they vote Yes to independence, from the dangers to pensions and Isas to disruption for entrepreneurs. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury – whose constituency is in Scotland – says people are ‘rightly starting to worry’, adding that independence ‘opens the flood gates to a sea of uncertainty on currency, rates and regulation’. Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Alexander will say the Scots have not been told what currency they will get paid in, what money they will use at a supermarket, the denomination of their savings or whether their pension is safe. He will tell the National Association of Pension Funds’ annual conference that letters and emails are being sent from savers worried that their Isas won’t be protected, pension holders worried about the security of their funds and small businesses worried their accounts will ‘soon be with a foreign bank, in a foreign currency’. His concerns echo warnings from a  growing list of major companies. Yesterday the chief executive Shell – the UK’s most valuable company – became the latest to sound the alarm. Ben van Beurden said Scottish independence would threaten the UK’s ‘continuity and stability’. Shell joins the likes of Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Barclays in speaking out against a Yes vote.

Police have been forced to release images of a mother stealing an expensive pram from a GP surgery after doctors refused to name her for data protection reasons. The thief was caught on CCTV walking into the entrance of her local practice before swapping her child’s pram for a more expensive one in the entrance hall. She then wandered off with the posh pushchair, leaving mother-of-two Hayley Skidmore stunned when she came out to find hers gone and an old, cheap one in its place. Out with the old: This mother is being sought by police after she was filmed walking into a GP's surgery with this old pram only to swap it for a more expensive version . In with the new: The woman left with the pricey pram, leaving her old one in its place, but medical staff have refused to name her because of Data Protection laws . Surgery staff told Hayley to call police and when officers arrived to view the security film workers immediately recognised the suspect. But they refused give her name, saying it would break data protection and patient confidentiality laws. Avon and Somerset Police have now been forced to release CCTV images to the public in the hope that they can trace and question the woman. However, a spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said that the act should not be used to block an investigation. A spokesman said: 'While I cannot comment on this specific case, where police have reasonable grounds to believe a crime has taken place the act should not be a barrier to that investigation.' Hayley, 26, of Cadbury Heath, Bristol, is furious the surgery is protecting the suspected thief. She said: 'I’m still in shock about it. 'The manager told me she had been told not to reveal the name because of the Data Protection Act. I don’t understand it. 'Obviously the woman was there for an appointment, but giving her name to police would have nothing to do with her private medical information - it’s about a suspected crime. 'She should be prosecuted - she shouldn’t be allowed to get away with something like that.' Hayley was visiting the surgery for a general check-up for her one-year-old son Lewis on February 5 when the theft happened. Hayley Skidmore, mother-of-two, was left shocked when she came out of her appointment with one-year-old son Lewis to discover her pram was gone . She had left the £300 limited edition black Maclaren, bought last May, for around an hour just inside the entrance in an area designated for buggies and strollers. But it was taken along with Lewis’s foot muff, his three-year-old sister Lola-Mae’s wellies, hat, and gloves, and paintings Lewis had done at pre-school. Ms Skidmore had her £300 Maclaren pram returned after the surgery contacted the thief, but police still don't know her identity . When a police officer arrived he was provided with a clear image of the prime suspect. But practice manager Helen Tillman said she could not reveal her name because she had been instructed not to, having taken legal advice from the Medical Defence Union (MDU). She was also advised not to comment to the media and the MDU has refused to further explain the decision. At the time of publishing the surgery were unavailable for further comment. Mrs Tillman did offer to contact the suspect and two days later the pram was returned. But a month after the incident at the Cadbury Heath Health Centre in Bristol police are still struggling to identify the suspected thief. NHS Property Services Ltd, which owns the health centre, also declined to comment. Hayley added: 'Everything was still in there when I got it back - even the juice that was in a beaker and the little bit of money in the back of the pram. Avon and Somerset police spokesman Martin Dunscombe said: 'As a result of positive action taken by the health centre the pram has been returned. 'We are waiting to speak to the victim about this, but at the moment our investigation is continuing.' He said a pushchair left behind by the suspect had been seized for forensic examination. He added: 'The staff at the health centre are doing as much as they can to support the investigation within the constraints of their own legal advice.'","Unknown woman visited GP surgery in Bristol with her baby .

The BBC is to broadcast a series of poignant previously unseen interviews with First World War veterans that were deemed too ‘personal’ to be shown when they were originally recorded in the 1960s. Rediscovered footage of Great War veterans talking about their first-hand experiences of the conflict will be shown in the documentary, I Was There: The Great War Interviews, on BBC Two next Friday night. In the early 1960s, the BBC interviewed 280 eyewitnesses of the First World War for its monumental documentary series, The Great War. The BBC is to broadcast a series of poignant previously unseen interviews with First World War veterans. Picture Shows British soldiers at Passchendaele in 1917 . However, according to modern documentary makers, the series concentrated on the battles and the politics - and moving personal reminiscences were not respected and in many cases left out. Modern audiences, by comparison, would appreciate the emotional perspective, they said. Using footage from these interviews, the new film illuminates the poignant human cost of the Great War, through the eyes of those who survived it. One dramatic testimony relives the moment the men left the trenches and went over the top. The interviews focus on real life experiences of the First World War including those of Henry Williamson (left) and Mabel Lethbridge (right) Richard Tobin, who served with the Royal Naval Division, said: ‘As soon as you got over the top, fear has left you and it is terror. 'You don’t look, you see. You don’t hear, you listen. Your nose is filled with fumes and death. 'You taste the top of your mouth... You’re hunted back to the jungle.

But hadn’t got the guts to do it.’ These poignant interviews will be broadcast along with many others after 50 years in the archives and following the deaths of all those who took part, after BBC executives felt modern audiences would embrace the records of the soldiers’ feelings and emotions. Mike Connolly, the executive producer, told the Telegraph: ‘The original program was very Reithian, concerning the battles and the politics.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 19:09 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:42 EST, 6 March 2014 . Business Secretary Vince Cable has accused teachers of failing to provide good careers advice for their pupils . Teachers are failing students because they ‘know absolutely nothing about the world of work’, Business Secretary Vince Cable has said. The Liberal Democrat minister was accused of being ‘crass’ and ‘insulting’ to teachers after suggesting they are to blame for a lack of good careers advice in schools. His remarks were seized on by political opponents, and risk undoing months of attempts by the Lib Dems to win back some of their traditional support in the teaching profession by attacking Education Secretary Michael Gove. The Business Secretary was speaking to hundreds of senior figures in the manufacturing industry, and claimed Government schemes to get students interested in careers in their sector were being thwarted by an ‘underlying problem’ - teachers themselves. ‘There has been an argument in Government about how to get the right careers advice in schools and successive governments have frankly messed this up,’ Mr Cable said. ‘But the underlying problem is of course that most teachers, particularly in the secondary sector, are graduates. ‘They know how universities work, they know what you have to do to get an A-level, they know about UCAS forms – but they know absolutely nothing about the world of work. ‘They don't know how to direct people to apprenticeships or traineeships which we're now doing as a first stage for people. ‘We're issuing guidance to schools on how they should put in place proper careers guidance in schools linked to the world of work, but we start from a bad place.’ A senior source at the Department for Education said: ‘These comments are offensive to teachers who work hard every day. Cable should pay a visit to some inner city schools before saying teachers know nothing about the world of work. Instead of lashing out at teachers, Cable should be getting business to engage with schools.’ Mr Cable claimed Government schemes to interest students in careers in their industry were thwarted by teachers . Cathy Bell, head of Esher Church School in Surrey, said Mr Cable’s remarks were ‘absurd’, pointing out that many teachers converted from other careers. ‘Before I went into teaching in 2000, I was responsible for managing a marketing and advertising budget for a cosmetics company which was larger than our entire school budget is now,’ she said. ‘There would be very few industries in which staff would have sufficient experience in all other business sectors to be able to give career advice. ‘Many teachers do convert to teaching from other careers, usually because they feel strongly about the vocational aspect of teaching, but there is nothing wrong with being a career teacher. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, labelled Mr Cable's comments 'crass' ‘We don't pretend to have an in depth knowledge of the manufacturing industry but even as a primary school, we have already this year taken our ten- and 11-year-old children on visits to manufacturing factories and had people talk to them who do. ‘When I was at school there was a careers advice centre which was separate to the school which sent people in to do practice interviews and offer careers advice.  I'm not sure at what point careers advice became the job of schools alone.’ Teachers’ representatives accused Mr Cable of seeking to curry favour from a business audience, saying he was ‘finding scapegoats and playing to the gallery’. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said: ‘This is a crass remark, which is insulting to teachers who are workers in their own right. ‘As the Government’s own survey shows, teachers work an extraordinary number of hours and show real dedication to the world of work. Indeed, the teaching profession mirrors society and many of our teachers come from diverse backgrounds with different life experiences. They are a resource to the young people they teach, not a hindrance.’ A spokeswoman for the Department for Business was unapologetic. ‘The Business Secretary was echoing concerns from industry about the need to improve the quality of careers advice in schools,’ she said. ‘He was making the point that teachers have an important role in making sure their pupils are aware of all options available to them to help them build a career. 'For some this may be via a graduate route, but for others a vocational skill or qualification is more appropriate.’","Lib Dem minister accused of being 'crass' and 'insulting'

Predator: Ouldkount Belabbas sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl in Madame Tussauds' gift shop . An Algerian illegal immigrant who sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl while she shopped for her mother’s birthday present at Madame Tussauds has been jailed for five years. Ouldkount Belabbas, 42, kissed and led the child away while she was deciding how to spend her pocket money in the gift shop at the world famous London tourist attraction. The 'highly predatory' paedophile is believed to have lived in the country illegally for 13 years prior to the offence but shortly after being arrested claimed asylum in the hope of avoiding deportation. After pinning the child in a corner of the gift shop, Belabbas began touching her chest until a group of Venezuelan tourists stopped him, Southwark Crown Court heard. Sentencing, Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'This defendant had been, in the time preceding the commission of these offences, in the habit of going to Madame Tussauds.' Lesley Jones, prosecuting, told the court that since his arrest, Belabbas had applied for asylum. She said: 'He is an Algerian national known to the immigration authorities. At the time of his arrest he had not made a claim for asylum and had failed to sign with the immigration authorities. 'He apparently has now made a claim and that is being considered,' she added. However, Barry Kogan, defending, said his client intended to return home after serving his sentence. He said: 'The fact of the matter is, this man has been in this country since 2001. He has no convictions recorded against him for anything of this nature - either violent or sexual.' He added: 'Once he has served his sentence, and he has already served several months, he wants to return to Algeria.' 'He realises that his life is not well here and he wants to return to his home country where his mother and sisters are.' CCTV evidence showed Belabbas had spent a 'significant period' of time in the waxwork museum’s coffee and gift shops, with no apparent purpose on August 5 last year. Describing the moments before the attack, the judge said: 'The victim asked her mother whether she could go into the gift shop. 'She didn’t tell her why, but her planned motive was to buy a small present with her pocket money to give to her mother on her forthcoming birthday.' It was at this point that the Algerian, who was living illegally in the UK under the name Xavier Garrero, saw his opportunity and approached the schoolgirl. No reason: CCTV evidence showed Belabbas had spent a 'significant period' of time in the waxwork museum's coffee and gift shops, with no apparent purpose on August 5 last year . The judge continued: 'He approached her and engaged in conversation, he offered her praise. 'He . probably kissed her in some way that was not sexual, but was designed . to encourage her to believe the he was a harmless person, someone rather . like a father figure. 'He . took the degree with some minor degree of force from the main body of . the gift shop into part of it that was little more than an alcove. He . took her into the corner of it which was not fully covered by CCTV.' 'The . whole of the evidence satisfies me beyond any doubt whatever that while . he had her pinned into the corner, he sexually assaulted her,' the . judge added, . Branding the Algerian national a . 'dangerous' offender, the judge said he needed to be given . an extended sentence for public protection. Belabbas, . of no fixed address, was found guilty of one count of sexual assault of . a child under 13, and one count of abducting a child. He must serve five years in prison before being released and serving eight years on an extended licence. A Home Office spokesman said he was unable to comment on whether Belabbas would be deported. He . added, however, that any individual from outside the European Economic . Area that has been sentenced to more than year in prison while their . asylum is pending is eligible for deportation after their term has been . served. Although the Home Office issues automatic deportation papers to all non European convicts sentenced to more than a year in prison, hundreds of the orders are challenged on human rights grounds. A series of cases have emerged in which criminals including killers and rapists have successfully claimed deportation would breach their human rights, to the fury of Conservative MPs. Belabbas fled Madame Tussauds after the group of Venezuelan tourists stopped him assaulting the girl, but returned a few days later and was arrested. The judge said: . 'This was not in any sense a chance encounter... Whatever he may have . been doing on previous day with whatever motivation, on this day I have . no doubt at all that he was where he was, doing what he did, because he . was in a manner that was highly predatory awaiting the arrival, if it . were to happen, of a child who he could make his victim.' He . added: 'This child has been significantly harmed by what happened and . there is at least a risk that that harm will persist as she grows up and . matures. It is to be profoundly wished that she can overcome it.' Return: Belabbas fled Madame Tussauds (pictured) after the group of Venezuelan tourists stopped him assaulting the girl, but came back a few days later and was arrested . The judge praised the child for the 'immense fortitude' she had shown in giving evidence during the trial. In . court Lesley Jones, prosecuting, read a statement the victim's mother . had prepared on behalf of her daughter, saying she had since lost . confidence and become unable to leave her mother’s side. Ms Jones continued: 'She [the victim’s . mother] said, she [the victim] is wary of men and men of particular . ethnic origin, which wasn’t the case before this incident.' The now 10-year-old’s mother also provided a statement to the court. Ms Jones said: 'She says she feels blame, guilt and anger and upset as a result.' 'She also says that she felt ashamed and embarrassed that this had happened to her daughter when she was in her care. 'She says it is hard to put her trust in people, and the world, because her trust has really been rocked to the core.' Defending, Barry Kogan said the abduction committed by his client only resulted in the child being taken 'a few yards' from the 'chocolate section of the gift shop over to the marbles section'. While accepting that Belabbas had still not admitted his actions, he added: 'He was at the time down on his luck.' 'He had been badly assaulted in the spring and had to have operations on his face. He had lost his job - he had been working on the market, he was having to sleep rough.' Alongside his five year sentence, Belabbas was made subject to a sexual offences prevention order until further notice. The order states he must not contact children under the age of 16, must not engage in conversation with children under the age of 16, and must not work in an environment where he would come into contact with anyone under 16.","Ouldkount Belabbas kissed and led child away while she was buying gifts .

A lawyer acting for a high school girl who threw a wild party at the home of a family for whom she was cat-sitting says a text message received from the family indicated to the teen that it was OK for her to have friends over. Michael S. Taheri says the 17-year-old City Honors School student agreed to look after the Binder family's seven cats while the family were away from their home in Buffalo. Taheri claims the text message gave the teen the impression that she was welcome to invite friends over to the house on Florence Avenue, where her school friend Zoey Binder, 18, and her father Stephen Binder and mother Kristen Segebarth live. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: Teens did thousands of dollars of damage to the home of Steven Binder and his wife, Kristen Segebarth . The text from Segebarth read: 'The kitties thank you and said that if you need to rendezvous with someone in the house while the Binder family is away, they’ll stay in the background [no huge drunken orgies tho, ok? Just small ones.] Heard the Yale interview went well!' reports the Buffalo News. This apparently gave the girl to understand that she could invite some friends over and she asked two girlfriends over to keep her company. Taheri says that the girl then went on a babysitting job and that it was one of the friends who invited the rest of the teenagers, who caused thousands of dollars of damage to the house and stole jewelry and $6,000 cash. Segebarth told the Buffalo News that the message was sent in jest and that her meaning was the exact opposite of her words. In case there was any confusion, Segebarth says she had her daughter also text the teen, saying 'NO [expletive] PARTIES IN THE HOME,' sent just before the family left for their dream vacation to Costa Rica to celebrate Zoey Binder's graduation and her impending study at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon their return from vacation though, the family discovered that their home had indeed been the scene of a bacchanal of huge proportions. Used condoms litter the floors and puddle of vomit, urine and feces were found in beds, reports the Buffalo News. There was graffiti and even holes in the walls as wells cash and jewelry missing. Taheri says the teen cannot be held responsible for the actions of the almost 50 teenage partygoers who were at the home on December 27. If anything, he says, she is also a victim of the circumstances, rather than an instigator. 'This is a young lady who is an honor student, applied to Ivy League colleges, has exceptional SAT scores and has no criminal record whatsoever. Zero,' Taheri said. 'We have fully cooperated with the police, given a list of the people at the party to the police and the family. They have also notified their homeowners insurance policy and gotten a claim number for the Binders,' the attorney said. The girl returned from her babysitting job and tried to herd everyone out of the house, a feat she achieved at 1am. She came clean to her parents about the party the following afternoon. 'At 1:45 p.m., she texted us that she had lied,' the mother told the Buffalo News, 'that there had been a mob at the house the night before and she was cleaning up and needed our help. She said she hadn’t slept because she was so upset and got up early in the morning and went back there to clean. 'Several kids came and helped for about an hour in the morning. We went over and there was vomit everywhere, broken furniture and dirt and mess. We helped her vacuum, do laundry and take out trash and broken glass …'The girl's family says that her own savings will be used to reimburse the family for the damage done, but that Stephen Binder's request for $8,500 for the cost of the holiday is unreasonable. Binder wants the money reimbursed because the family's holiday was ruined by the actions of the girl. Gross: The homeowners found urine, feces and vomit all over their house . Binder and Segebarth say they have had to initiate all contact with the cat sitter and her family and had no idea that they had retained the services of a lawyer. When Binder asked the teen's parents to . pay for the damages, they offered him $90, which wouldn't even begin to . cover the thousands of dollars worth of damage done to the house, the . jewelry that was stolen, or the $6,000 in cash that was taken from the . house. When Binder and his family entered their home, they found the mother of the cat-sitter standing in their foyer next to a vacuum cleaner. She explained that there was a problem with one of the beds and that she had taken the liberty of taking a comforter and two rugs to a professional cleaner. But Binder - still confused as to why there was thousands of dollars in damage to his home, as well as urine and vomit everywhere - wanted to know what caused all of the damage. 'What the hell happened?' he asked the girl's mother. Friends of the 17-year-old cat-sitter, who the family describes as a 'trusted friend' of their daughter,  from many of the area's elite private schools - with names like City Honors School, Nardin Academy, St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute had converged on the home. As if the urine feces and vomit wasn't bad enough, Binder tells the Buffalo News that he also found used condoms scattered throughout the house. Then video of the teens destroying the house started popping up on social media websites. In one of the videos, a male was seen urinating on 18-year-old Zoey Binder's bed - as another teen is narrating, saying 'this is for you.' 'The destruction to our house is considerable. There was human feces, urine and vomit in numerous locations. Every floor in the house was rifled. There was broken furniture and there were multiple used condoms,' Binder told the paper, as he and his wife explained that it wasn't until last week that the stench from the December 27 party was finally gone. 'It took an industrial strength cleaning to get rid of the odors of urine and vomit, and we keep discovering more,' Binder said. 'I don’t know that I won’t open a box in my attic at some point and discover more vomit. There was vomit everywhere.' According to Binder, the cats the 17-year-old was supposed to be watching were so traumatized by what went on during the party 'that they did not come out of their hiding places until two days after we had come home.' Authorities have been given a list of the names of at least 46 people who were at the party as they begin to investigate the role the cat-sitter played in throwing the party. Authorities say that 25 of the teens involved in destroying the house attended City Honors, seven were from . Nardin Academy, six from Canisius High School, four from St. Joseph’s . Collegiate Institute - which charges fees of $10,000 a year - three from a Williamsville high school and one was . an exchange student. Elite: The majority of teens who destroyed the home went to elite private schools like St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute . The identity of the 17-year-old cat-sitter has not been made public. In addition to the video of a teenager urinating on Zoey Binder's bed, authorities found other social media entries they believe are in reference to the party: . 'If I didn’t die last night, I’m probably living forever.' 'I am DISGUSTED by every aspect of this night.' 'Never realized that I go to school with such horny people.' 'Roll another bowl.' Binder says he and his wife met with the parents of the cat-sitter. He says they asked them to reimburse the $8,500 they spent on their vacation as partial restitution for the damage done to their home. The girls' parents, however, gave them a check for $90 - the amount they'd paid the girl to watch their cats. If no criminal charges are filed, Binder will likely sue the parents of the cat-sitter in civil court.","The 17-year-old girl who was cat-sitting for Buffalo family when a wild party took place says it's not her fault .

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 7 March 2014 . Prince Harry's endless optimism kept spirits high during the polar trek . Prince Harry has earned a few minutes of quiet reflection. And late last year, the fourth in line to the throne, whose life of royal and military duty rarely allows him a moment to himself, went to the ends of the earth to find them. Before Christmas he spent five weeks with a team of servicemen and women who had lost limbs to Taliban bombs in Afghanistan, marching more than 200 miles across the harshest and most inhospitable landscape on the planet in temperatures of -50C to the South Pole. Now the full story of this incredible trek is to be told in a two-part series starting next Sunday on ITV. 'This is one of the few places on earth that hasn't been screwed up by humans,' Harry muses. 'It's amazing, it's ridiculous that a place like this should exist. It's just nice to be out here with time to think about things, without being hassled. If you can't be free here, where can you be free?' But, as the series reveals, it was Harry's indomitable sense of fun that proved most invaluable to the party. It shows how HRH might just stand for Harry's Raucous Humour, as he teases team guide Conrad Dickinson about his Northumberland accent, joking, 'Our team is going to have one extra, a translator – so everyone can understand what you're talking about.' And his cheerful optimism in the face of horrendous weather kept spirits high. 'Minus 40... it's damn cold,' he smiles. 'This definitely wasn't the weather prediction.' Prince Harry takes the lead during his polar trek with wounded servicemen and women . The cheerfully dark humour of Royal Artillery officer Major Kate Philp matches his. 'We had half as many legs as the average Antarctic trek: just one per team member. The objective,' she tells me, 'was getting to the South Pole, and then returning home in one piece – or at least as much of one piece as we were in when we started! And we didn't dare miss the last flight home before Christmas. There were a few wives and families, not to mention the Queen, who would not have been happy.' Major Philp was the first British woman to lose a limb on active service, the victim of an IED (improvised explosive device) in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2008. She was joined by ex-RAF Regiment Sergeant Duncan Slater, who lost both legs in an IED blast in 2009, and Captain Guy Disney and Captain Ibrar Ali, who also both lost limbs on Afghan duty. Harry was worried that his fitness levels would let the team down . But the Prince started with a serious disadvantage – while the others had been training for the expedition for a year, he had not had that luxury. 'I'm a little bit anxious, nervous, all those things,' he admitted before they set out. 'I don't want to let the team down through fitness. There's a lot of pressure on everybody. My worries are that we'll push ourselves far too quickly. We'd never forgive ourselves if someone dropped out. 'It's about knowing exactly what you can and can't do. I'm terrified for myself, hugely daunted, so I can't imagine what it's going to be like for them. To take a double amputee to the Pole, it's going to be quite a moving moment when we get there. For me it's bigger than just these guys – we're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that they're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives.' Prince Harry and Ivan Castro as they reach the South Pole . Harry poses for a photo at the South Pole . Weather conditions were awful and freak storms the previous winter had piled the snow into mounds and troughs. Even the all-weather support vehicles struggled – and the team had to do it with artificial limbs. 'For me it's bigger than just these guys – . we're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that . they're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives.' For most of us it defies imagination. 'I knew it would be hard,' says Major Philp, 'but it was by far the hardest thing I've done. The physical exhaustion, and the mental challenge of looking at a white desert day after day – it takes its toll.' 'It wasn't easy,' says Sgt Slater, 'but the support we had made it possible. And a major part of that support came from Harry. He has a fantastic sense of humour, and he fitted right in. That's essential, because if the rest of us felt we didn't know how to speak to him, or if we were constantly worrying that he might find this or that remark offensive, it would burn up extra energy – energy you can't afford to lose. But we never thought, ""We've got the fourth-in-line here, what are we supposed to be saying?"" He wasn't like that, he was just brilliant.' Prince Harry during a kit weighing session . Major Philp agrees. 'He's a military man through and through, so with the shared military background it seemed a comfortable environment for him to be in. Harry got stuck in from the start: he made a great effort to get to know people, and he performed brilliantly on the trek. He was strong both physically and mentally, an incredibly valuable member of the team.' For Sgt Slater, the expedition was the fulfilment of a promise he made to himself during the darkest days after his injury, to seek out the biggest test he could find. His aim was to send a message: don't write us off. 'People see amputees and assume we won't be as capable as able-bodied people,' he says. 'They don't mean it unkindly, but it's a big obstacle when wounded ex-servicemen are looking for jobs. So this was about showing what we could do.' His goal now is to take his message into schools and businesses as an inspirational speaker. But the physical challenges are far from over. The team are training hard for this year's London marathon. And if Prince Harry should make a surprise last-minute decision to join them, he'll have his work cut out to keep up once more.

Apple sold more than $1 billion of Apple TV set-top boxes in 2013 and is investing heavily in the next generation of products, boss Tim Cook said at the company's annual meeting today. The firm is believed to be working on a range of TV sets alongside an improved version of its current $99 TV box. Future versions are expected to include apps and the ability to watch live TV as well as buy movies and TV shows. Apple's current $99 TV box, which the firm revealed today has made it over $1bn . Rumours claim that Apple's TV set will use a 4K screen making is far sharper than even current HDTV pictures. The firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live TV as well as but films ans TV shows. It is also expected to be able to run apps, and work with an iPad or iPhone as a remote control. Apple's ability to again transform the fast-moving technology arena is the central question in investors' and Silicon Valley executives' minds as the company's growth slows, and rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Google Inc take chunks out of its market share. Industry executives and Apple observers continue to believe that the company will come up with some sort of wearable device, like a smartwatch, and speculation persists about a long-rumored TV product of some sort to shake up the living room viewing experience. 'We're working on some things that are extensions of things you can see and some that you can't see,' Cook said at the annual meeting, referring to a 32 percent increase in research and development costs last year. Responding to a question about innovation, Cook said Apple preferred not to talk about new products under development so as not to tip off the competition. 'You can see we're getting ripped off left, right and sideways,' he said. Apple's shares fell 0.27 percent to close at $526.24 on Friday. They have clawed back substantial ground since falling below $400 in June, but remain well below the record-high $700 level of 2012, weighed by concerns about whether the company has any new hit products in the pipeline. Though Cook steered clear of that discussion, he shed some more light on the Apple TV business, which executives have long referred to as a 'hobby' for a company expected to chalk up some $181 billion in sales this fiscal year. CEO Tim Cook also slammed Android for security problems, and warned short term investor not to buy stock . The $99 Apple TV set-top box, which streams content from Netflix and other video sources to a TV, had racked up $1 billion in sales in the past year, he said. 'It's a little more difficult to call it a hobby these days,' Cook said. Cook took pot shots at Google, saying that most users of its Android mobile operating system are using older versions, presenting a security threat. In contrast, he said, 89 percent of users of devices based on Apple's iOS operating system have the most recent version of the software. Shareholders at the annual meeting at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters re-elected all board members. In the run-up to the meeting at 1 Infinite Loop, many investors had publicly debated whether Apple should not put any of its massive cash pile to better use. Cook said the company will provide an update within 60 days on how it will use the cash, which totaled nearly $160 billion at the end of 2013. That time frame is in line with Apple's previous comments that it would announce its latest cash management plans around April. Google also has its eye on the TV market, and recently launched the Chromecast, a $39 dongle to give any TV online capabilities . Apple repurchased $14 billion in stock in a two-week period earlier this year, under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who had been publicly calling for the iPhone-maker to buy back an additional $50 billion of stock on top of its existing buyback program. The billionaire investor, who in late January said he held more than $4 billion of Apple shares, withdrew his shareholder proposal following Apple's announcement of the buyback. Some analysts believe Apple may eventually dip into its coffers to buy something big. The iPhone maker has so far shied away from the mega-acquisitions that far more aggressive rivals like Google and Facebook Inc have pursued, though Cook did not rule out forking over a big sum of cash if warranted. Cook said Apple has acquired 23 companies in the last 16 months and remained on the lookout for interesting technology and companies. Apple is not in a race to acquire the most companies or to spend the most money, but that 'doesn't mean we won't buy a huge company tomorrow afternoon,' he said. And he warned shareholders not to focus too narrowly on short-term gains. 'If you're in Apple for only a week ... or two months, I would encourage you not to invest in Apple,' he said. 'We are here for the long term.'","CEO Tim Cook also slammed Android for security problems .

In their new tell-all book titled Growing Up Duggar, the eldest girls - Jana, 24, Jill, 22, Jessa, 21, and Jinger, 20 - explain that 'it’s easy to put yourself into physical and moral danger and give into those emotions or sensual thoughts that promise pleasant, but only temporary, fulfillment.' Even when they are alone, the siblings from Arkansas say they 'control' what's going on in their minds, adding: 'By censoring our thoughts through the filter of God’s word, we will be able to recant any wrong thoughts or temptations that try to sneak in.' Growing pains: The devout Christian Duggar daughters open up about courtship, eating disorders and sibling rivalry in new tell-all book titled Growing Up Duggar .

It was revealed last month that she is seeing fellow church-goer, Ben Seewald, and the two stick to traditional religious dating rules. They avoid physical contact completely, only 'side hugging' briefly to say hello or goodbye, and kissing will be saved for their wedding day. 'All of us have . gone through times when we’ve felt we need to lose weight' Elsewhere in their book the Duggar . sisters open up about eating disorders and moments of rage, making it . clear that what goes on behind closed doors is very different from what . people see on TV. Addressing the subject of body image, they write: 'You . may think that kids like the Duggars, who are homeschooled and don’t . watch TV or read secular magazines, are immune from feelings like that, . but we’re not!' 'We’ve experienced some of those same negative feelings about the girl . in the mirror that you may be feeling right now or have felt in the . past.

'I find the defendant not a witness of truth,' Judge Yau told a packed court room. 'I find that he is someone who is prepared to, and did try to, lie whenever he saw the need to do so.' The judge said he exaggerated the amount of profit made by his hair salon business. The trial also revealed Yeung's close links to Macau's casino world, both as an investor and gambler, and how that enabled business investments that helped him amass his wealth. He maintained that he built a fortune of hundreds of million of dollars through stock trading and business ventures in China. Millionaire: Yeung, who bought Birmingham in October 2009, resigned as the club's president and director last month - he is still their majority shareholder . Tycoon: Yeung surrounded by the media at an earlier hearing in his money laundering trial back in June 2011 . But prosecutors said he was unable to show where £7.7million in his bank account had come from. The Judge's verdict said there was reasonable doubt to believe that various business deals represented 'proceeds of an indictable offence.' Yeung bought Birmingham in October 2009 for £81.5million from David Sullivan and David Gold, now the co-owners of West Ham. He is still the majority shareholder but resigned last month as the club's president, director and director and chairman of the club's parent company, Birmingham International Holdings Ltd (BIHL) to await the verdict.

'Mr Yeung unequivocally confirms that he has no disagreement with the board and that there are no other matters relating to his resignation that are required to be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the company.'

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:22 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:33 EST, 6 March 2014 . The daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. on Thursday urged her brothers to search their consciences and reconsider their plan to sell the civil rights icon's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize. King's estate is run by his two sons, Martin Luther King III and Dexter King. The estate's lawyers filed court papers Jan. 31 asking a judge to order their sister, the Rev. Bernice King, to surrender the items. The Rev. Bernice King strongly disagrees with her brothers over the sale of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Bible and Nobel Peace Prize medal - she had until Monday to surrender both items . A lawyer for the estate said at a court hearing last month that the estate has been in conversations with entities that want to buy or lease them. Bernice has repeatedly said she opposes any such deal. 'I implore you to consider the magnitude of this moment in history and how you want your individual legacies to be defined,' Bernice said at a news conference at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, addressing her brothers who weren't present. The estate's lawyers had asked a judge to order Bernice to immediately turn over the items, saying the potential deals to sell or lease them were time-sensitive. The children of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King (from left) Martin Luther King III, Dexter King, the late Yolanda King and Bernice King stand next to a crypt dedicated to their parents in Atlanta in 2006 . Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney declined to do that at a hearing last month, saying it would be more appropriate to maintain the status quo until the ownership dispute is resolved. He ordered that the items be kept together in a safe deposit box in the name of the estate but that the keys be given to the court. McBurney set a deadline of Wednesday for the items to be placed in the safe deposit box. Eric Barnum, Bernice's lawyer, said the parties' conflicting schedules didn't allow them to meet that deadline and that the judge agreed to extend it to Monday. Bernice said some people had urged her to refuse to hand over the Bible and Nobel Peace Prize and to go to jail instead. But she said she will comply with the judge's order. 'It is, deep in my soul, difficult to place what my father described as precious heirlooms under the custody of the government, even if only for a season,' she said. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. receiving  the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, in 1964 . 'Yet, I recognize that justice and righteousness are not always aligned, and there is often a disconnect between God's law and man's law.' The estate's lawyers have said the Bible and peace prize medal belong to the estate under a 1995 agreement in which King's heirs signed over their rights to many items they inherited from him. The three surviving King children are all board members of the estate, and they held a special board meeting in late January to vote on a proposed sale of the Bible and peace prize, estate lawyer William Hill said at the hearing last month. They voted 2-1 in favor of the sale, with Bernice being the dissenting vote, Hill said. Bernice on Thursday called on her brothers to hold another vote and said she hopes that at least one of them would change his vote. Historic: Dr. Martin Luther King at the podium giving a speech in Montgomery, Alabama - with his Bible visible on the rostrum . 'With God's help, I can only believe that the judge's ruling is not a setback but an opportunity for my brothers to step up to reason and do what their conscience tells them is right,' she said. Though she hasn't spoken to her brothers since the lawsuit was filed, Bernice said she hopes they can reconcile their differences on the matter and said she would be open to an out-of-court settlement. Bernice appealed to anyone who might consider buying the Bible and Nobel Peace Prize to take the moral high road and 'leave the sacred in its sacred state.' Bernice was joined at the news conference by supporters, including Elizabeth Omilami, the daughter of civil rights leader Hosea Williams, and the Rev. Willie Bolden, who said he participated with King in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.",Rev.

A North Carolina gambler has been arrested after he allegedly flushed $2.7 million worth of fake poker chips down the toilet at an Atlantic City hotel room, clogging the pipes. Christian Lusardi, 42, of Fayetteville, had been using the counterfeit chips during the Winter Poker Open's 'Big Stack, No Limit Hold 'Em' event at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, police said. But, days into the tournament, officials wised up to his game, and he attempted to dispose of the evidence by flushing the chips, unsuccessfully, at Harrah's Resort and Casino. Cheat? Christian Lusardi, pictured, has been arrested after he flushed $2.7 million worth of fake poker chips down the toilet at an Atlantic City hotel room, clogging the pipes . Lusardi's stash clogged the sewer pipes, prompting the hotel to notify Borgata officials who contacted New Jersey police. Officers found Lusardi Friday at a motel in Atlantic City and he was arrested over the weekend. Police said Lusardi introduced the counterfeit chips into the tournament on multiple occasions. He won a total of $6,814 during the competition, CNN reported. Flush: Days into the tournament, officials wised up to Lusardi's alleged game, and he attempted to dispose of the evidence by flushing the chips, unsuccessfully, at Harrah's Resort and Casino, pictured . The competition began in mid-January, but late last week officials discovered $800,000 of the imposter chips - 160 chips worth $5,000 each - among the genuine casino chips. The counterfeit chips forced officials to suspend the event for 24 hours. Soon after, the tournament was canceled. 'This was a very unusual occurrence. It's the first time in Borgata's 10 years that anything like this has happened,' Joe Lupo, senior vice president of operations at Borgata, told CNN. 'We are very pleased that the New Jersey State Police Casino Gaming Bureau has apprehended a suspect,' Lupo said. 'While this is a very positive development, the investigation by the Division of Gaming Enforcement and the State Police is ongoing.' Lusardi was charged with rigging a publicly exhibited contest, criminal attempt, and theft by deception. He was being held on $300,000 bail, with no option to pay 10 per cent, at the Atlantic City Jail, police said. More than 4,800 hopefuls enrolled in the poker tournament and when it was canceled Friday, 27 people remained in the game.","Christian Lusardi, 42, had been using the chips for days during the Winter Poker Open's 'Big Stack, No Limit Hold 'Em' event in Atlantic City .

But just months after this picture was taken, Police Constable Carol Howard launched a race and gender discrimination claim against the force, claiming that her career had been held back by bullies. The 34-year-old firearms officer, who is a member the elite Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) – the same unit embroiled in the Plebgate scandal – has accused a senior male officer of denying her equal opportunities because of her race and gender.

Rebekah Brooks yesterday denied waiting around for years like ‘Miss Havisham’ for her lover Andy Coulson to make a commitment to her. The former News of the World editor, 45, admitted ‘confiding’ in Coulson when a story appeared in the tabloid in 2002 about murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s voicemail messages, which later caused a public outcry forcing the closure of the paper. Their on-off relationship, which began in 1998, had several periods of ‘physical intimacy’ until 2004, when Brooks and Coulson were working as editor and deputy editor respectively, the Old Bailey heard. 'For six years I waited': Rebekah Brooks, left, used the anguished phrase in a love letter to her former colleague Andy Coulson, right, with whom she had an affair - but yesterday she denied waiting so long for him to commit . When Coulson tried to break it off in February 2004, Brooks wrote an anguished love letter found on her computer which said: ‘For six years, I waited’. But yesterday she said their relationship did not last for six years – and denied waiting like the spinster Miss Havisham in the Dickens novel Great Expectations. She said: ‘ I didn’t have an affair for six years - if it was true I would say. ‘I think at the time when I am going back to when we were first together, that was in 1998 which is six years, at that moment at night when I wrote it, that’s what I felt. It was the emotion of the moment. ‘At that time, I had got back together with Ross [Kemp, Brooks’ then-husband], got married, bought a house together and tried for a baby. ‘My marriage had gone wrong again, but Andy Coulson had already got on with his life. ‘I’m clearly saying it’s been six years since we first got together, in my heart at that moment felt it I had waited. ‘Of course, I hadn’t been sitting there waiting like Miss Havisham.’ 'I hadn¿t been sitting there waiting like Miss Havisham': Martita Hunt as Miss Havisham and John Mills as Pip in the 1946 film adaptation of Great Expectations, the classic novel by Charles Dickens . Brooks and Coulson deny phone hacking and misconduct in public office. She also denies perverting the course of justice. The Old Bailey heard that the couple shared their inner-most thoughts and secrets, from their personal and professional lives. Their relationship, which began in 1998, had several periods of ‘physical intimacy’ until 2004, jurors have heard. It came at the height of a phone hacking conspiracy, when Brooks and Coulson, now both 45, were working as editor and deputy editor respectively. She said of the tender letter, penned when she was married to Kemp: ‘The emotions I felt I had to Andy had obviously come out in this letter. ‘We didn’t have an affair for six years, but we were close, good friends.’ Yesterday Brooks was asked whether she was talking to Coulson ‘in that confidential way’ in April 2002, when the pair are accused of knowing Milly Dowler’s phone had been hacked by the tabloid. Barely audible to the court, Brooks whispered: ‘Yes.’ Brooks and Coulson deny phone hacking and misconduct in public office. She also denies perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:23 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:44 EST, 7 March 2014 . A murder suspect has been cleared after experts found that a supposed confession she made in a 999 call was mis-heard because of her strong regional accent. Teresa Rylands, 33, has spent weeks in custody, wrongly accused of killing an alcoholic friend who died after falling down the stairs. A key piece of evidence was the hysterical 999 call she made after Neil Mitchell, 48, fell at home in Newton Abbot, Devon, in August. The murder trial took place at Exeter Crown and County Court, where Theresa Rylands, 33, was cleared of all charges . She was thought to have told the operator: ‘I don’t care – I pushed him down the stairs, just get someone in here.’ But acoustic tests showed the Liverpudlian actually said: ‘I don’t care if you say I pushed him down the stairs, just get someone in here.’ Prosecutor Paul Dunkels QC said: ‘She was becoming increasingly agitated at the questions from the operator.’ The mistake occurred because the Devon police officer who transcribed her 999 call to the ambulance service was confused by her strong Scouse accent. Social workers told Exeter Crown Court that Mr Mitchell had previously made false complaints of being assaulted to explain drunken falls. Forensic tests also showed that a head injury was probably caused when he hit a radiator at the bottom of the stairs rather than by a blow before he fell. Neil Mitchell had fallen at his home in Netwon Abbot, and the local ambulance services were thought to have heard a criminal confession . Miss Rylands was arrested after 48-year-old Mr Mitchell died from injuries he suffered in a fall down the stairs in his home in Barton Drive, Newton Abbot, Devon, in August last year. She has always denied playing any part in the accident, which happened when Mr Mitchell was more than four times over the drink drive limit. He had one leg longer than the other as a result of suffering serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1983 and was often unstable on his feet because he chose not to wear a caliper on his leg. He had also become a chronic alcoholic who had been drinking heavily before his fatal fall, Exeter Crown Court was told. Rylands, of Newton Abbot, denied murder and was found not guilty by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, after the prosecution offered no evidence and withdrew the case. She appeared by video link from Eastwood Park prison in Bristol where she has been held for the past week after being arrested for alleged breach of bail conditions. The judge ordered she should be freed immediately. Mr Paul Dunkels, QC, prosecuting, said Mr Mitchell's family had been informed of the decision to halt the case. He said: 'The deceased Mr Mitchell was aged 48 at the time of his death and had suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1983 which left him with a weakness down one side of his body and his right leg significantly shorter than his left. Newton Abbot is a market town and civil parish in the Teignbridge District of Devon, England on the River Teign . 'He was supposed to wear calipers to assist his gait and balance but frequently did not do so. 'Unfortunately, living with his ongoing difficulties and the effect of his injury, led him to drink to excess and he became an alcoholic. 'The defendant was staying at his home on the night of August 12 to 13 last year and in the morning of the 13th the deceased fell down the stairs and suffered a head injury from which he died five days later. 'The prosecution case was that Miss Rylands had struck him on the back of the head or pushed him so as to propel him down the stairs. The defence was he lost balance and fell and it was an accident. 'There were two strands of evidence. The first was what Mr Mitchell said to the paramedics before they took him to hospital, which was the only account he gave because he was put into a medically induced coma at Torbay Hospital and did not regain consciousness. 'In response to direct question when the paramedics arrived he said he had not been assaulted and had just fallen down the stairs. 'The paramedic pressed him, principally because his control had wrongly informed him that a knife was involved. That was a mistake. 'He continued to question Mr Mitchell with a great deal of persistence and in the end he said he had been hit on the head before he fell. 'The Crown have to assess the reliability of that account and inquiries were made with social support workers and those who looked after him for social services. 'It became clear he frequently fell over and on occasions said he sustained the injuries from being attacked but the social workers said that was not the case and he had said out of embarrassment to make an excuse. 'The other aspect is the 999 call during which Miss Rylands was emotional and hysterical and gave an account that was difficult to understand because of her very strong accent and was originally interpreted as her saying she did not care if she did push him down the stairs. 'Police sent the tape to an acoustic expert who used specialist equipment which enabled them clarify what she said.'It is clear she was becoming increasingly agitated at the questions from the operator and what she said was ""I don't care if you say I pushed him down the stairs, just get someone in here"". 'The deceased suffered a laceration to the back of his head and the pathological evidence is that he could have been hit or that he had hit his head on a radiator at the foot of the stairs on which his blood was found. 'The suggestion that he lost his balance and suffered an accident is plausible. He had a very high blood alcohol level of 328 milligrams per 100 millilitres. 'His drinking habits may have given him a significant tolerance but the view of the experts is that nevertheless this level of alcohol would have impaired his balance and coordination. 'He had a history of losing his balance when in drink and the Crown take the view there is no realistic prospect of conviction.' Miss Rylands, of Newton Abbot, denied murder and was found not guilty after prosecutors withdrew their case.","Teresa Rylands, 33, spent weeks in custody after being wrongly accused .

Fragile: Baby Beatrix who failed to breathe for the first 23 minutes of her life was saved by a doctor who refused to give up on her . A newborn baby who failed to breathe for the first 23 minutes of her life was saved by a doctor who refused to let her die. Distraught Charlotte Richards feared the worst as a 15-strong crash team battled to save her tiny daughter Beatrix. The child had stopped breathing and after 20 minutes, the normal cut-off point, medics were about to give up. But one consultant urged a final attempt to save her because he said the tiny baby reminded him of his own daughter. At the last moment little Beatrix coughed and spluttered and came back to life. Relieved Mrs Richards, 24, said: 'As I brought her out she didn’t breathe and I knew something wasn’t right. 'The midwife took her and all the panic buttons were pressed. 'After they’d been working on her for 15 minutes I’d pretty much given up hope. It seemed like a lifetime. 'I felt like I was in a film - it was just awful. It was as if someone had just slammed the door on our life. 'But after 23 minutes this one consultant said they should try just once more - and it worked. 'Afterwards he told me that something about her reminded him of his own daughter and he had decided not to give up. It’s a miracle really. Beatrix, who weighed 6lb 2oz, arrived in a water birth at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, suffering from perinatal asphyxia after a placental bleed. The condition results in newborns being deprived of oxygen and often causes brain damage or death. After Beatrix was revived she was rushed into intensive care for two-and-a-half hours. Mrs Richards and estate agent husband Lloyd had to wait another two hours before they got to see their baby for the first time. Fighter: Beatrix arrived in a water birth at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, suffering from perinatal asphyxia after a placental bleed . They were only allowed 10 minutes with her because of her fragile condition and they were warned to take photos in case the worst happened and she didn’t make it. That evening she was transferred to specialists at London’s St Thomas’ Hospital where she was wrapped in a cooling blanket for 72 hours. It circulated water around her tiny body and brought down her core body temperature, reducing the risk of brain damage. Four days after she was born Mr and Mrs Richards were finally able to hold her for the first time. Look at her now: Beatrix is now back at home with her parents in Hertfordshire and has not suffered any brain damage . Ten weeks on, Beatrix is now home and well in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire. An MRI scan during her traumatic first days showed that she suffered none of the brain damage feared. Mr Richards, 39, said: 'We have been very, very lucky'. Mrs Richards, an accounts director, added: 'I’m not surprised that my daughter is a fighter. 'My mum is battling cancer at the moment and winning - there’s a lot of tough women in our family. 'But until she came out of hospital it was 10 days, especially the first four days, that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemies. 'It’s just lovely to have her home.' The grateful couple, who also have a healthy three year-old daughter Isabella, are now fundraising for the Harlow hospital to show their thanks.","Charlotte Richards feared the worst when baby Beatrix stopped breathing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:57 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:48 EST, 7 March 2014 . New research has found that some people are just incapable of 'getting' or being able to derive enjoyment from music . Few things can stir the emotions like a piece of music – an experience that was thought to be shared by all. But it turns out that some are completely immune to its charms. Scientists at the University of Barcelona in Spain have discovered that a minority of people who are perfectly able to experience pleasure in other ways simply don’t ‘get’ music. The new condition, which has been named musical anhedonia, was found by scientist Josep Marco-Pallares. He said: ‘The identification of these individuals could be very important to understanding how a set of notes is translated into emotions.’ In research on how we respond to rewards, he found those left unmoved by music could still find pleasure in other ways, such as winning money. He added: ‘There might be different ways to access the reward  system. Some might be more effective than others.’ The researchers previously found hints about this form of anhedonia after they developed a questionnaire to evaluate individual differences in musical reward. The evaluations found some people who reported low sensitivity to music but average sensitivity to other kinds of reward. However, multiple explanations are possible for these low music sensitivities. For instance, some people might seem to dislike music because they have trouble perceiving it, a condition called amusia. For the current study, the research team decided to look more closely at three groups of 10 people, with each group consisting of participants with high pleasure ratings in response to music, average pleasure ratings in response to music, or low sensitivity to musical reward, respectively. They were chosen based on their comparable overall sensitivity to other types of rewards and their ability to perceive music. They took part in two different experiments: a music task, in which they had to rate the degree of pleasure they were experiencing while listening to pleasant music, and a monetary incentive delay task, in which they had to respond quickly to a target in order to win or avoid losing real money. Most are able to enjoy music, with it bringing up pleasurable memories or provoking an emotional reaction where the brain perceives reward . Both tasks have been shown to engage reward-related neural circuits and produce a rush of dopamine. Meanwhile, the researchers recorded changes of skin conductance response and heart rate as physiologic indicators of emotion. The results were clear: some otherwise healthy and happy people do not enjoy music and show no autonomic responses to its sound, despite normal musical perception capacities. Those people do respond to monetary rewards, which shows that low sensitivity to music isn't tied to some global abnormality of the reward network. The researchers say their findings might lead to new understandings of the reward system, with implications for pathologies including addiction and affective disorders. Marco-Pallarés added: 'The idea that people can be sensitive to one type of reward and not to another suggests that there might be different ways to access the reward system and that, for each person, some ways might be more effective than others.'","Musical anhedonia was found by scientists in University of Barcelona .

The movie about a medical engineer and an astronaut stranded in space after an accident, starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, bagged seven awards during one of the most hotly contended events in years. But while the awards are normally the domain of the major Hollywood film studios, two small British visual effects teams emerged as the stars of the event. Triumph: (From left to right) Visual effects artists Timothy Webber, Chris Lawrence, David Shirk, and  Neil Corbould celebrate winning Best Achievement in Visual Effects award for 'Gravity' at the Oscars . Framestore brought the stunning visuals in the lost-in-space fantasy drama to life - creating everything you see on screen except the actors' faces, while the jaw-dropping 3D effects were the product of conversion company Prime Focus World. Collecting one of the golden statuettes, the film's visual effects supervisor Tim Webber praised the crew behind the camera for their extraordinary work producing one of the most talked-about films of the year. But it is testament to the skill of . the visual effects experts who helped create the amazing film - produced almost entirely inside a cramped studio - that much . of their work was invisible to the audience. Stunning: Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone, won seven awards at the Oscars . Complicated: The team behind the visual effects had to created a convincing sense of zero gravity using Computer Graphics . Describing one of the most difficult scenes to capture, Mr Webber - . who has worked on films including The Dark Knight and Avatar - detailed . how painstaking attention had to be paid to every frame in order to . maintain the sense of reality. Gravity was the toast of Tinseltown after winning seven Oscars. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón was lauded for his vision which helped create a stunning movie. But Oscar judges heaped praise upon the team behind the film's revolutionary special effects. The film won: . 'There’s the shot where the International . Space Station is being destroyed, which is incredibly complicated to . choreograph and to simulate the destruction, and Sandra’s action is very . complicated in that, so that was very difficult,' he told The Telegraph. The team pioneered Computer Graphics which involved imposing actors in a studio on to entire landscapes and backgrounds. What set Gravity apart from other films which used computers were the hyper realistic backgrounds. Whereas the 2009 sci-fi 3D epic Avatar was set in a fantasy landscape, . Gravity had the difficulty of making the interior of the . international space station as convincing as possible. One . of the techniques adopted was called previsual in which every camera . angle and movement of the actor was planned in advance. The . painstaking process enabled the team to seamlessly impose the actors . into an environment where objects, cameras and background appear to be . moving. Webber told The Telegraph: . 'We did replace bits of it with CG, because she was being held up by . rigs, and rigs would cover bits of her, but on the whole it’s her body. And so that made that incredibly complicated to shoot to make it look as . though she was floating.' The use of 3D effects was also was also a hallmark of the movie. A team from Prime Focus World spent six-months converting the film footage into stunning and convincing stereo or 3D images. 'Many of our early discussions about the stereo concerned the contrast in style between the environments inside and outside the capsule,' said Richard Baker, Senior Stereographer, Prime Focus World. Award-winners: Glenn Freemantle (R), winner for Best Sound Editing with Niv Adiri, Christopher Benstead, Chris Munro (L-R) winners for Sound Mixing, all for the film 'Gravity' Painstaking: The finished film was the culmination of months of painstaking work by visual effects teams . Meticulous: The actors faces were imposed onto a computer generated background . 'Part of the vision for the stereo was to create a contrast between the vast, unending feeling of space for the exterior shots and the claustrophobia, isolation and loneliness of the interior shots in the close confines of the capsule – something that I feel really comes across when you see the film.' 'Everyone with an interest in filmmaking is familiar with the long seamless shots that Alfonso and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki created for Children of Men,' said Matthew Bristowe. 'On Gravity, Alfonso and Emmanuel have gone one step further. The long, unbroken, floating camera shots work spectacularly well in space, and led to us producing the longest continuous shot that I believe has ever been converted – 15,531 frames, or 10mins 47 secs. High-tech: Creating the stunning movie Gravity was only made possible with thanks to cutting edge computer technology . Gravity is about a medical engineer and an astronaut stranded in space after an accident . 'But for us, this film was so much more than just the technical achievements, or solving the production challenges - Gravity is one of those movies that we’ll all look back on later in our careers and be extremely proud to have worked on.' 'There was a time, perhaps, when conversion was seen by some as an afterthought, tacked onto the end of the filmmaking process to sell more tickets,' added Richard Baker. 'Gravity is here to bury that thought once and for all. Gravity is unlike anything you have seen before. In terms of 3D, this film is awe-inspiring. 'In terms of filmmaking, it’s a quantum leap forward, creatively and technically. In terms of unifying the practical toolsets used to realize the storytelling vision, it’s unmatched. It was an absolute honor to be part of the team entrusted with delivering Alfonso’s extraordinary vision for Gravity.' Gravity is available to own now on Blu-ray, DVD and in 3D.","London-based Prime Focus World created stunning 3D effects .

Both women were found in the basement of the home they shared; . each was shot once in the head, police said. Sarah Wolfe, 38, was . a psychiatrist for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's . Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. Susan Wolfe, 44, was a . teacher's aide at Hillel Academy in the city's Squirrel Hill . neighborhood. In a criminal complaint, . authorities suggested Wade attacked Susan Wolfe when she was home alone, . based on surveillance video from a transit bus Susan Wolfe rode home, . other video from Sarah Wolfe's employer and home alarm records that . enabled detectives to reconstruct some of the sister's movements the . night before they were found dead. Susan Wolfe's body was found . naked and doused with bleach and liquid detergent. Sarah Wolfe was . likely killed when she returned home from work later that night, the . video and alarm records suggest. She was found clothed but with a . blanket over her head. Her purse had been emptied. Smoker: A man fitting Wade's description withdrew $600 from the Wolfe sisters' accounts and bought two packets of Newport cigarettes at a nearby store . Police said . items belonging to the sisters - identification cards, credit and bank . cards, keys and cellphones - were missing. According to TribLive.com, Wade is also accused of stealing these possessions. The victims' bank accounts show that $600 was withdrawn using their debit cards after midnight on February 7. A surveillance video recorded a person in gray sweatpants and bright white shoes at an ATM in East Liberty withdrawing money at that time. The same person was captured on camera walking away from where Sarah Wolfe's car had been abandoned and toward the ATM. The person is then shown removing the sweatpants near a Midas Muffler shop. Police recovered the pants and found a business card that belonged to an associate of Susan Wolfe in the pocket. The man then walked to a Sunioco gas station at 1:08am and threw something into a garbage can then bought two packets of Newport cigarettes in the store. Detectives later found a pen with 'Iowa' on it in the gas station's trash, police said, which is believed to be from the home of the Wolfe sisters. 'Unimaginably sad': Matthew Bucholz, pictured with his late girlfriend Sarah Wolfe . The man from the surveillance footage was later identified as Wade. DNA testing from a bloodstain on the sweatpants matched Wade, police told TribLive.com.

Family and friends of a New Jersey teenager mauled to death by a bull mastiff last week gathered for his funeral on Thursday. Kenneth Santillan, 13, died after a 115 pound dog attacked him and his friend as they walked home from school in Paterson on Friday. At his funeral, attended by more than 100 people, the teenager was remembered as being a friendly boy who liked to play practical jokes on his classmates. Grief: Family and friends comfort each other as they leave the funeral of Kenneth Santillan, who was killed by a dog . Loss: Kenneth had just celebrated his 13th birthday when he was viciously attacked on the way home from school . School friends and neighbors were among those who spoke at the service. Kenneth's love of the New York Mets was touched on by a neighbor of the family, who drew a short laugh from mourners when he recalled how: '[Kenneth] loved reminding people that the Mets were the best and the Yankees stink.' Another friend recalled how he found a slice of melted cheese hidden in his math book by Kenneth, who loved practical jokes, North Jersey reported. A neighbor, who spoke on behalf of the boy's devastated family, added that he loved to flatter his parents, and would often nudge his mother and ask: 'What's . cooking, good looking?' as she made his favorite barbecue chicken dinner. The community of Paterson has been shocked by the mauling, which was the first fatal dog attack in the town. The year-old dog had broken free on Friday and attacked Kenneth and his 13-year-old friend, as well as its owner. Sorrow: Classmates and relatives paid tribute to the friendly teenager who loved practical jokes . The second school boy was released from hospital this week. Details about the owner's injuries were not clear, Passaic County Assistant Prosecutor Michael DeMarco told NJ.com. An investigation has been started into the attack, and the dog was euthanized. Its owner, Paul Clarke, has been issued with two summonses. The woman who gave Clarke the dog, named Trigger, said she was surprised to hear of the attack, and said it would never have happened if she still owned the animal. Patricia told ABC7: 'Everybody around here knew and loved Trigger. The seniors in the building, it's like he grew up with everybody here.' She had the dog from when he was an eight-week-old puppy but gave him away because he got too big. Clarke reportedly had to stab the dog in order to subdue the animal, according to the New York Daily News. Kenneth and his friend had been walking with the friend along a creek behind Clarke's home when the attack occurred, neighbor Elizabeth Hatsko told MailOnline. The dog jumped out at the boys, initially attacking the unidentified friend, before they split up. Clarke . ran at the dog, and was attacked himself, before stabbing it several . times to keep it at bay until animal control arrived, according to the Bergen Record. Victim: Kenneth Santillan, pictured with father Kenny, was mauled by a 115-pound bull mastiff . Mourning: Kenneth with his father, who is devastated by the loss of his son . In the days after the attack, family members left tributes to the teenager on social media. 'RIP the best cousin I've had,' Cassie Nadia commented on a picture posted by Carlos Pastor. It is not clear if Clarke will face any criminal charges, but a lawyer retained by injured but alive boy's family intends to sue for damages. 'We intend on pursuing a claim for his injuries, certainly,' the attorney told the Record. Trigger had escaped two times prior to Friday's incident - once he was recovered by Clarke, a second time he was found by Animal Control. The dog barked a lot and intimidated neighbors, but it had not attacked anyone, Hatsko said.

Appeal: Alan Jeal was only identified after his relatives recognised this artist's impression that was posted on the Devon and Cornwall police website . A dead man who was washed up naked on a Cornish beach has been identified as a 64-year-old who lived alone and had not been reported missing. Alan Eric Jeal, 64, was found by a dog walker at high tide at 2pm last Tuesday on Perranporth beach in Cornwall. He was wearing nothing but socks and one walking shoe. His identity remained a mystery for seven days, until his relatives this Tuesday recognised an artist's impression of his face on Devon and Cornwall Police's website. Police are treating Mr Jeal's death as suspicious after a post-mortem revealed that he had suffered a number of injuries. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Thorne, senior investigating officer in the case, said Mr Jeal was formally identified yesterday and his next of kin informed of his death. 'Firstly, our thoughts are with Alan's family and friends at this upsetting time and we will do everything we can to support them,' said the policeman. 'Now that we know his identity, we can progress with the investigation and try to find out exactly what happened to him. 'He was last seen on Monday 24 February, the day before his body was discovered, and I would welcome information from anyone who knew Alan, or who saw him in the days leading up to his death.' A CCTV image has been released showing the last known sighting of Mr Jeal, on Monday February 24, just after 12pm, in Wadebridge town centre. Mystery: Mr Jeal was last seen alive in this CCTV camera footage, left, which was captured on February 24, the day before his body was found. The jacket pictured right was found near where his body was washed up . Poignant: This photograph was also found on the same beach. It is believed to show Mr Jeal as a child . Police have also released a series of photographs of objects found near Mr Jeal's body on the beach. A Regatta jacket, a wallet and a photograph of a young boy were discovered a day after Mr Jeal's body was found and are believed to have belonged to him. The photograph, dated 13 April 1952, is thought to show Mr Jeal in the family home when he was two years old. It is not known whether a rucksack and woolly hat are linked to him.

A 12 year-old schoolgirl who has a higher IQ than Einstein has high hopes for the future - she wants to be Prime Minister. Ophelia Gregory had always been curious about her intelligence after excelling at school. Last month she decided to travel to London with her mother Kerry where she sat the the Mensa test. Genius: Kerry Gregory with her daughter Ophelia who has scored 162 on a MENSA test, the highest a person under 18 can get . The pupil was stunned when she discovered she was awarded a mark of 162 - the highest score possible for somebody under the age of 18. The score puts her into the top one per cent of Britain's brainiest folk and ahead of Prof Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and Albert Einstein who all scored 160. Ophelia, from Ashford, Kent, said she hoped one day to use her intelligence to reach Number 10. She said: 'I was just curious to see how smart I was. I was hoping to get into Mensa but I didn't think I would get the top score. Clever: Ophelia is also a talented violinist and cellist and regularly calls radio programmes to talk about political issues . 'I am quite proud. I told some of my friends but only one of them knew what Mensa was and that was because they saw it on The Simpsons. 'There are a few career paths I could follow but I would quite like to be a politician - I plan to go for prime minister. 'I regularly listen to radio programmes and I'm lucky enough to be in a family that discusses political issues. 'I really don't understand the way the country is being run at the moment.' Talented: Orphelia holding the certificate which shows she has qualified to become a member of Mensa . Ophelia, one of three children, is also a talented violinist and attends Highworth Grammar School. Her mother Kerry, 43, said: 'We've always been curious about Ophelia and she was up for doing the test. 'She scored higher than Einstein or Stephen Hawking - I don't know where she gets it from. 'She's getting an excellent education anyway, and we're getting help from Mensa, but we hope her school will now support her to reach her full potential.' Ambitious: Ophelia Gregory, who has scored 162 on a MENSA test, holding a copy of Animal Farm by George Orwell . Father Tom, 45, an business analyst, added: 'Ophelia has always had a great interest in politics and current affairs and likes to call radio talk shows and give her opinions. 'We knew she was smarter than the average 12-year-old from the things she talks about and the questions she asks. 'She's being quite modest but we're very proud of her.' Ophelia scored 162 on the Cattell IIIB test which is designed to test a person's range of abilities and intelligence and in the UK the average score is 100. John Stevenage, chief executive of British Mensa Ltd, said: 'Ophelia's score shows she has great potential and we are pleased to welcome her to Mensa.

A personal trainer in Texas who once served as a peace officer has found himself on the wrong side of the law after he was caught on a hidden camera breaking into one of his client's truck and allegedly stealing money while the man was inside of the gym working out. A few weeks ago, David Spivey noticed that money left inside his truck was continuously vanishing. Initially, Spivey had thought that a family member was responsible for stealing the money, so he hatched a plan to stick a hidden camera in his vehicle and wait for the culprit to strike again. Smile for the camera: Reginald Wilson was caught on hidden camera breaking into one of his client's trucks as the man was exercising . Spivey was shocked to discover that it wasn't a family member who had been repeatedly burglarizing his truck, rather it was his personal trainer, Reginald Wilson, and it happened in the parking lot of the gym where the two men met for Spivey's training sessions. The video - which Spivey turned over to police and a local television station in Tyler, about 100 miles southeast of Dallas - shows Wilson entering his truck, opening the center console and taking something that Spivey says was money. 'It's pretty self explanatory; [Wilson's] hand went in empty and came out with green stuff,' Spivey says of the video during an interview with KLTV. In addition to the camera Spivey planted inside the vehicle, he also had a friend waiting in the parking lot with another camera. That video also shows Wilson entering Spivey's truck and leaving with something in his hand. Busted: Reginald Wilson was caught on hidden camera burglarizing his client's truck . 'I have outside footage and I also have inside camera showing what I . caught him doing,' Spivey says. 'It is what it is; I can't do anything . about it. I'm just glad that it's not happening anymore.' Spivey says he would often leave his wallet in his truck when he went into the gym to workout, thinking it would be safer there than in one of the gym's lockers. 'The only thing I ever took in there was the key. Who would have thought . that somebody would go into my locker, get a key out and go in my truck? Especially my trainer,' he says. 'I mean it just goes to show you, you can't trust anybody,' Spivey continues. Mystery solved: David Spivey initially thought family members were burglarizing his car until he installed a hidden camera to catch the thief . Spivey says that he's glad the mystery has been solved and he will continue to work out at the same gym - however, he'll most likely be hiring a new trainer. 'It took me a bunch of money to figure out it wasn't a family member, a . bunch of time, a bunch of patience, and a bunch of good friends,' Spivey says. Wilson was hit with two counts of burglary of a vehicle. According to KLTV, he is no longer employed as a peace officer.","David Spivey initially thought family members were stealing money from his truck .

New addition to the brood: Mandy Batchelor has two older children and said that she had no idea she was pregnant with a third before giving birth on Friday .

Healthy: Even though his parents may not have been ready, the baby was and was born after a full term weighing 7 pounds and 13 ounces . She said that while she did notice a difference on the scale, she thought it was just her 'normal winter weight gain'. The only other clue, she told KDVR, was that she had some lower back pain.

Condoms with messages such as ‘hump one,’ ‘enjoy one,’ ‘one lucky lady, ‘tasty one’ and a picture of a shark going after a small fish were donated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, but have since been returned after angry parents voiced their concern. ‘I was horrified,’ mother Helen Dajer told the Boston Globe. ‘As a mother of three teenagers, there was no way I wanted my kids to be given condoms with those wrappers.’ Inappropriate: Many parents were infuriated over the wrappers on condoms being handed out in Boston Public Schools to their teen children . ‘We made the decision to take all of those condoms out of school circulation and to go with some that had different, generic wrappers,’ a schools spokesperson told WBZ. ‘Right idea, wrong execution,’ mother Stephanie Bode told the Globe. ‘I so fully support condoms in the schools, and it was incredibly courageous for BPS to adopt the policy.’ Officials are not sure how many of the 40,000 condoms were handed out to students, they admitted, but said a new shipment of about 20,000 was on the way. ‘We support BPS’s decision to replace these condoms with neutrally-packaged condoms,’ health officials said in a statement. Global Protection Corp., the company that makes the condoms, has offered to donate the new generic condoms free of charge, a company spokesperson told the paper.

Star-crossed actor: Armand Assante, 64, appeared in court in an effort to save his Orange, County, New York, estate from foreclosure . Actor Armand Assante was in a New York court this week in a last-ditch attempt to save his rustic mansion from foreclosure. The 64-year-old star of the original 'Judge Dredd' appeared in the state Supreme Court in Goshen with his legal team Wednesday, asking a judge for a temporary restraining order to prevent his Campbell Hall horse farm from being auctioned off in May. Assante's attorney Tom Vlasti argued that the veteran film and TV star was the victim of mortgage fraud. While the Emmy-winning actor was filming in Romania in 2005, one of his financial advisers secured a $1.5million, 30-year mortgage on his behalf from Eastern Savings Bank in Maryland at nearly 10 per cent interest - a rate double the national average. According to the lawyer, the bank used fraudulent methods to increase the interest rate and turned down settlement offers because its goal all along was to seize the 7,000-square-foot rural estate worth $3.5million. Rustic elegance: Assante owns this sprawling horse farm that sits on 7,000 square feet of land in Campbell Hall worth $3.5million . Family man: Assante, 64, said in court that he had built the rustic home with his father, and he wants to leave it to his two daughters (right) ‘I wasn’t targeted because I’m a celebrity,’ Assante told the New York Post's Page Six. ‘I was targeted because I have an equity-rich property.’ 'The Odyssey' star, who declared bankruptcy in 2011, said he is determined to continue his nine-year battle to expose the bank's alleged malfeasance. Assante, a divorced father of two, said he had built the sprawling estate sitting on a large tract on land in Orange County, New York, with his late father, and he wants to leave it as a legacy to his two daughters, Anya and Alesandra. Assante’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing from 2011 stated that he owed $12,138 to the Screen Actors’ Guild’s credit union and $36,574 for unpaid taxes for 2006, 2007 and 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported. To add to the actor's apparent financial troubles, his former spouse of 12 years, Karen Assante, sued him in 2012 claiming that he owed her $1.8million in unpaid matrimonial support, according to The Record Online.

But it was not until the young Long Island woman vanished more than a week ago that her family discovered the truth: Jasmine Joseph had not seen the inside of a classroom at the New York Institute of Technology since May of last year. The Syosset resident went missing February 24 after calling her mother at around 5pm to tell her that she was studying in the library at the Old Westbury campus. Police later determined that Jasmine Joseph was in a Syosset gym when she placed the call to her mother. The 22-year-old never made it home that night, and her parents' calls later started going straight to voicemail.

Frantic search: The parents rushed to the New York Institute of Technology campus in Old Westbury to look for Jasmine, but found no sign of her . Family life: The 22-year-old has been living with her parents in Syosset . Wholesome: Mr Joseph (top) works as an electronics technician, his wife (bottom center) is a registered nurse, and their son (far left) is away in medical school . Mrs Joseph noted that there had been a few warning signs, including the fact that that her daughter was no longer bringing text books home. But the 22-year-old explained that she was doing her coursework online. Tearful plea: Sony Joseph begged his daughter to return home and promised that she will not be punished . The parents became even more concerned when Jasmine, who had been a straight-A student, failed to bring a report card this winter. ‘When her father asked to see the report card, she said there was something wrong with the computer,' said Mrs Joseph, a registered  nurse with the North Shore-LIJ Health System. On the night of Jasmine's disappearance, the parents went to search for her on campus, believing that someone had kidnapped her. They found no sign of the 22-year-old or her silver Nissan. Investigators, however, do not think that Jasmine, who is legally an adult, was the victim of foul play. The woman's father, a technician with the New York Transit Authority, insisted that his daughter – whom he decribed as being ‘always happy’ - had no reason to run away because she was free to come and go as she pleased, and was not subjected to strict rules. When asked if the college junior may have been upset about a boyfriend, Sony Joseph stated that his daughter was not in a relationship with anyone. Friends, family and volunteers have spent the past week distributing 'missing' flyers and raising awareness of Jasmine's disappearance through a Facebook page. Kompassist Missing Persons Network also set up an online fundraiser on Fundly.com to finance the search efforts. Joseph is 5-foot-4 and weighing 120lbs with brown eyes and black hair.

New York Yankees great Mariano Rivera picked up one more epic save six months after retiring from baseball. The legendary reliever has renovated a long-vacant historic church in suburban New York that will be the new home of his wife's ministry starting Thursday. For years, Rivera had been crediting God for his skills on the field, where he tallied a record 652 saves before retiring last season. Open for business: Former New York Yankees relief pitcher Mariano Rivera opens the door to his new Refugio de Esperanza (Refuge of Hope) church, Thursday, in New Rochelle . Historic site: the 107-year-old Presbyterian church was abandoned in the 1970s and was eventually bought by New Rochelle . Princely gift: Rivera bought the abandoned church building so that his wife, Clara (right), a Pentecostal minister, could expand her congregation . Now his foundation has poured about $3million into restoring the 107-year-old church for Refugio de Esperanza, or Refuge of Hope, the Pentecostal Christian congregation led by his wife, Clara. Rivera, 44, has been quiet about the project, declining to speak about it in advance of the opening. Most residents walking by earlier this week did not even know he was involved. But he briefly mentioned the opening of the church after receiving a humanitarian award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation Monday. ‘You don't do it to be recognized,’ he said. ‘You do it because it comes from the heart. You want to please the Lord.’ The handsome grey stone building had been a Presbyterian church but was abandoned in the 1970s and was eventually bought by New Rochelle, a diverse city of about 77,000 just 6 miles north of the Bronx. The church is next door to the police . and courts headquarters, and the police had used some of the space to . store evidence, said architect Jonathan Villani. Meanwhile, . his wife's congregation had been outgrowing its meeting place — the . Rivera home. Rivera told New York magazine last year, ‘We only fit like . 50 people, 60 people tops.’ Hands-on approach: Rivera's business partner said the retired Yankee was acting as a general contractor on the project and overseeing every detail . Mixed group: Rivera said his wife congregation is made up of 50-60 people of different ethnicity and various walks of life . Inaugural prayer: Ana Rivera, left, prays during the opening service at Refugio de Esperanza . ‘We have whites, we have blacks, we have Hispanics,’ he said. ‘We have all kinds. It doesn't matter. As long as you love Christ, we in it. And if you don't love him, we will work with you so we put you on the right path.’ The congregation's website says it ‘felt the need to organize a local church that would not only present the message of salvation to its attendees, but also provide programs that would meet the needs of the less fortunate in the community.’ Plans call for a ‘learning center’ that will provide education, sports and other after-school programs to children. ‘He's doing something not just for his faith but at the same time setting up a place where he can help kids,’ said Brandon Steiner, a Rivera business partner whose sports memorabilia firm is headquartered in New Rochelle. Steiner said he's never seen Rivera so focused on a project. ‘He was like the general contractor,’ Steiner said, laughing. ‘He was in there directing painters.’ The city agreed to sell the building to Rivera for $1 in return for his promise to rehabilitate it. One opponent at the time, City Councilman Louis Trangucci, said Wednesday he still feels the city should have tried to get more for the property. All smiles: The former Bronx Bomber addressed the worshipers from the alter of his wife's new church, with Edeli Zorilla, left, acting as a translator . But he said the project has only enhanced the area ‘and I support what Mariano had done with the church.’ Mayor Noam Bramson said the city did not have the money it would have taken to save the building.Villani said the church needed plenty of work: the bell tower had begun collapsing, a new front wall needed to be built and new stained glass windows installed. ‘We loved the stonework, and some of the inside beams were still in good condition,’ he said.Across the street at Kenny's Barbershop, Carlos Sanchez has been watching the renovation every day. ‘It looks a lot better,’ the barber said. He even met Rivera at the site several times. ‘He's a cool guy,’ Sanchez said. ‘And look what he's doing, a new church in the neighborhood.’","Rivera, 44, bought the abandoned building from the City of New Rochelle for $1 and poured $3million into restoring it .

Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills has sold her British beachfront home for £2.75 million ($4.47m) to superstar DJ Fatboy Slim and his wife, DJ Zoe Ball - as she continues to spend most of her time in Austria. The 44-year-old blonde, who is training to win a spot on the GB Paralympic team for the 2014 Winter games in Sochi, Russia, sold the stunning property to the DJ, real name Norman Cook, and his wife - who already own a property on the same row in Hove, East Sussex. The celebrity enclave boasts a string of celebrity residents, including singer Adele and British comedian David Walliams. Austria-bound: Heather Mills now divides her time between the UK and Austria, where she trains for the Winter 2014 Paralympic Games . Heather, who had her left leg amputated below the knee after a collision with a police motorbike in 1993, is keen to compete in the Winter 2014 games - and has already splashed out on two properties in Austria. She bought a £1.5 million ($2.4m) two-bedroom apartment inside the grounds of the five-star, 400-year-old Schlosshotel Velden, a former royal palace, in May this year. And she already owns a £1.4 million ($2.3m) chalet near Goldeck am Millstätter See, in the Austrian Alps, which she uses as her base for her training. The mother-of-one - who has a nine-year-old daughter Beatrice with Sir Paul, 70 - put her eight-bedroom home stately country estate in the historic village of Robertsbridge in East Sussex up for sale for £3.9 ($6.3m) million last year. However, she changed her mind and later withdrew it from the market. New owners: DJ Fayboy Slim, aka Norman Cook, and his wife, DJ Zoe Ball, have snapped up Heather Mills' home in Hove, East Sussex . Stunning: Heather Mills has sold her home in 'Millionaire's Row' in Hove, East Sussex, for £2.75 million to Fatboy Slim and Zoe Ball . Heather has shared custody of her daughter with Sir Paul, and Beatrice's base is in the UK, where she goes to school. Sir Paul now spends much of his time in New York with his third wife, Nancy Shevell. And a source said: 'Paul and Heather have total split custody of Beatrice. Paul will spend a week in the US and then come home to see Beatrice and then fly back again. Her home is in the UK. 'Heather does the same, she splits her time now between Austria and the UK.' Heather built up an impressive property porfolio following her bitter divorce from Sir Paul in 2008. But she has been off-loading her homes and last year sold a condominium in the West Village, Manhattan, for $5 million, as well as an apartment on The Bishops Avenue, Hampstead, North London, for £3.75million ($6.1m).

Birthday girl: Sir Paul McCartney celebrates his daughter Beatrice's ninth birthday at Serafina in New York City in October . Following the end of her tumultous marriage to Beatles legend Sir Paul, Heather was awarded a £24.3 million ($39.5m) settlement, and has used this money to enlist the help of numerous former skiers, including the previous world speed record holder John Clark. She had a trial with the British disability skiing team in December 2010 and she officially joined the 19-strong development squad last year. But despite her speed, Heather's progress was hampered by difficulties with her prosthetic leg, which frequently ""ejected"" her from her skis - and has suffered a string of accidents. In May 2011 she had to be airlifted to hospital  after colliding with a pole during training and fracturing her shoulder. Then, just six months later, she injured her partly amputated left leg and broke her thumb. She told BBC Sport last month: 'I was a little bit concerned because when I went into it [training], the leg kept coming off, but now the London Prosthetics Centre has helped design a new one. 'It means it cuts the circulation off for two minutes from the start to the finish of the course before I release it. But it actually stays on so, fingers crossed, no more injuries!' So THAT'S where Macca's money went: Heather Mills paid £1.5m for a fairytale two-bed apartment in a converted Austrian castle . Sprawling: Heather Mills put her East Sussex estate up for sale for £3.9 million - but later took it off the market . Swanky: Heather Mills sold her apartment in New York's trendy West Village for $5 million last year . She claimed the Super-G Austria Cup title in the speed race nine months ago. And Four gold medals  followed in April at the US Adaptive Alpine Skiing National Championships in Aspen, Colorado. The improvements will have to continue throughout the next 16 months if she wants to win a place at the the Paralympics in March 2014. Heather will have to achieve a International Paralympic Committee Alpine Ski  [IPCAS] score of 80 points and British coaches have now insistead that she work on her technique and enter additional slalom races in a bid to improve her chances. She said: 'It's going to put my injury risk up even more. I'm going to try it and then hopefully convince them otherwise to say 'Do you want some medals in speed, or absolutely zilch at Sochi?' so we'll see.' Paralympic dreams: Heather Mills poses at The Life Ball in Vienna, Austria, in May . In May, Heather told Hello! magazine her young daughter told her: 'I';ve got the hottest mummy in school', thanks to her improved physique, adding: ""She is really proud of me, and so lovely and sweet. To get the confidence about how you look from your daughter is heart-warming.' She declared: “My goal is to get to Russia and to win a medal. The older you get, the more you realise that if you hang on in there, you can get past virtually anything. I’m not afraid of anything. You can’t feel fear if you’re going to be a good downhill skier,” she adds. “And I’ve been skiing at 120km an hour!'","She still owns £3.9 million stately home in East Sussex to allow her ex, Sir Paul McCartney, access to their daughter Beatrice as part of shared custody agreement following their bitter divorce .

A dog that was found in a frozen lake has been reunited with its owners after they saw news coverage of his Coast Guard rescue. Owner Jodi Benchich said that her 14-year-old dog KC went missing 10 days ago and she had been searching for him. '(I) found that the rope was broke and I just dropped everything and went searching,' Ms Benchich told WXYZ. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Happy together: Jodi Benchich was reunited with her 14-year-old dog KC after it was missing for 10 days . Tender loving care: The vet said that KC's frost bite and 30 pound weight loss can be fixed by Benchich . The dog covered a lot of territory, and the lake where he was found is about 30 miles away from his home in Romeo. 'I owe the Coast Guard guys a lot. It's amazing that they'll stop to even help an animal,' Ms Benchich said. The veterinarian treating the dog said that it had not suffered any irreparable damage though it did have frostbite. KC had also lost about 30 pounds during the ordeal, but that can be fixed with special meals and attentive care from his owners. Handling with care: Two officers from a Coast Guard ice cutter came to the aid of this dog who was trapped in this ice on Lake St. Clair on the Michigan-Canada border on Monday . The Coast Guard's Bristol Bay ice . cutter was headed to search for any other vessels that could have been . trapped in the frozen ice when they spotted a group of foxes surrounding . something in the distance. As they made their way closer to the site, they realized that a dog had become trapped in the layers of ice and was near death. 'It was cold, weak and tired. It may have been out there for a couple of days or so,' Chief Petty Officer Alan Haraf told The Detroit Free Press. 'They noticed three burrows the dog tried to dig for itself for protection. They said the paws were bleeding and the nails were pretty much down to nothing.' Three petty officers on board the ice cutter, called the Bristol Bay, packed on their cold weather gear and rescued the dog. The dog, which the crew members nicknamed 'Lucky', was wearing a collar and harness but did not have a tag. Making a stop: The boat was looking for stranded vessels when it spotted a group of foxes that had surrounded this dog . Once the dog was brought back on board using a stretcher, he was warmed up by the officers and fed some chicken breast. The ice breaker headed back to Detroit from there and one of the officers took it to a local veterinarian. It still remains unclear how the dog got out onto the ice and how he became stuck. var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 640; p.config.height = 360; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS'); .","Jodi Benchich's dog went missing 10 days ago and now they have been reunited after the dog was rescued by the Coast Guard on a frozen lake .

Three men have been charged for the November death of a 71-year-old Ann Arbor man one of them met through the gay hook-up app Grindr.Mark Paling, 19, Rikky Ranger, 20 and Richard Thompson, 19, two of whom identified themselves as homeless to police, were charged with the robbery and murder of David Edward Maurer, whose body was found in his apartment in a senior community a week after his death.Police initially believed the death was not suspicious until it was noted items were missing from the apartment. The suspects were tracked down via credit card transactions the three made using Maurer's cards. Write caption here . Credit card trail: Mark Paling (left), 19, and Ricky Ranger (right), 20, were discovered after using Mark Maurer's credit card . Police first responded to Maurer's apartment on December 1 when the manager of his apartment complex alerted them to a 'strong odor of decay,' said Detective William Stanford. MLive.com reports that the Washtenaw County Medical Examiner's Office estimated Maurer had been dead for more than a week and that Maurer's doctor signed his death certificate and noting that there was no sign of foul play. Police could not locate Maurer's cell phone or wallet, but the apartment block manager told police she had seen nothing suspicious in the building. Fatal hold: Richard Thompson, 19, held Mark Maurer in a headlock until he died . She called police 10 days later, however, when she had reviewed the complex's security footage. She noticed Maurer enter the complex with three young men on the evening of October 23. An hour and a half later, the three suspects are seen leaving the complex carrying 'what appears to be... some type of electronic notebook,' reports MLive.com. Detectives reviewed Maurer's credit card activity and discovered account activity on November 24 and 25, including charges for hotel stays, food and gas. Paling was identified in security footage as one of the three men entering Maurer's apartment complex. He already had an outstanding warrant for third-degree criminal sexual conduct. They tracked Paling and Ranger down to a house in Wayne belonging to a church caretaker who told police he took in homeless people. 'He stated he met Rikky Ranger on a website called Grinder [sic] and had made friends with him,' Stanford said. Once police had located the suspects, 'it was over rather quickly' Detective Lieutenant Robert Pfannes told MLive.com. The pair told police they had met Maurer on Grindr and 'gone out a couple of times,' but that they 'had never had sexual relations.' Together with Thompson, they decided to rob David Maurer and set up a meeting. At Maurer's Ann Arbor apartment, they smoked marijuana and drank alcohol and Thompson told police Maurer, Ranger and Paling became 'sexually active' together. At a certain point, they gave a signal to Thomson, who held Maurer in a headlock while the other two stole a .22 caliber revolver, a wallet, marijuana, cash and prescription drugs, two watches and a laptop. According to MLive.com, Thompson kept Maurer in the headlock for as long as it took the others to steal his possessions - between five or 10 minutes. Quiet community: The Lurie Terrace Senior Apartments where Maurer was found dead in his home . Thompson stated that he was concerned he had killed Maurer because his body 'went limp' very soon after he grabbed him in the choke hold. The three left the apartment, and Maurer was dropped face-down on his sofa, the same position in which his body was found more than a week later. According to MLive, tears streamed down Thompson's face as he was arraigned. The three were charged Sunday with murder, robbery, conspiracy to commit unarmed robbery, lacerny in a building and larcerny of a firearm and are being held in Washtenaw County Jail. Their next court appearance is scheduled for December 26. Police described Ranger and Paling as 'more transient than homeless,' and said Thompson lived with his father. Shelley Ripley, Maurer's neighbor, was shocked by the manner of his death. 'He was a gentleman and a gentle man,' she told MLive.com.","Rikky Ranger, 20, Mark Paling and Richard Thompson, both 19, have been charged with murder in the death of Mark Maurer, 71 .

A Jewish rabbi and teacher at a girls’ seminary in Brooklyn was arrested Wednesday on child pornography charges after his wife turned him in. Samuel Waldman, 52, was busted by feds after Homeland Security agents found him to be sharing at least three disturbing videos with children aged from four to 11-years-old engaging in sex acts, according to a criminal complaint. A girl believed to be only four-years-old was shown performing oral sex on and having intercourse with adult men in one of the videos, and a nine-year-old boy was shown in another being fondled by an adult male, the complaint said. Embattled: Brooklyn rabbi and girls' seminary teach Samuel Waldman faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on child porn charge . ‘Samuel Waldman’s position of trust in the community, as both a rabbi and a teacher, makes his alleged distribution of child pornography all the more disturbing,’ United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a press release. The files were found November 1 on Waldman’s computer during a sting operation in which the feds downloaded the files from him using a peer-to-peer file sharing program, authorities said. This allowed them to trace the sickening files back to his home using his IP address, they said. An IP address is the unique identifier by which each computer connects to the internet, no two are the same. Investigators visited the man’s home Monday and spoke to his wife, that conversation led to Wednesday’s raid. Officials did not find the videos previously downloaded, but did find enough evidence to place him under arrest. They also confiscated his computer, according to WPIX. Home sweet home: Federal agents raided Waldman's home Wednesday and arrested him after they say he admitted to the accusations . The affidavit also states that Waldman admitted to downloading, viewing and sharing child pornography for years, something he declined in multiple interviews. ‘[It’s] false, specifically the way they are describing the distribution and dissemination,’ he told the New York Post. ‘It’s absolutely being misconstrued completely, 100%, and we will fight that to the end.’ ‘I’ll have my time in court,’ he told News 12 in a bizarre interview that saw him pacing up and down his Brooklyn street trying to avoid the camera. ‘Some people have created a story, [I] did not admit,’ he continued. ‘They can say whatever they want.’ When pressed by the Post as to whether or not he viewed the videos, he replied ‘that I’m not going into right now.’ He works with young girls: Waldman is a teacher at this Brooklyn girls' school, which declined to comment when reached by MailOnline . Waldman is a teacher at the Beth Jacob Teachers Seminary, only blocks from his home. A person who answered the phone at the school refused comment and promptly hung up when reached by MailOnline. It is not known which classes he teachers, or the ages of his students. The rabbi was charged with one count of transporting or distributing child pornography, and faces between five and 20 years in prison if convicted. He was also ordered to have no unsupervised contact with children and no employment with access to children. He was released on $100,000 bail, it is not clear when he is due again in court.","Samuel Waldman faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of child pornography charge .

An outbreak of a rare skin infection is sweeping through New York City's Chinatowns, according to a warning issued by the Health Department. The department was informed of the outbreak by doctors servicing the Chinese community in New York, who have reported at least 30 cases of Mycobacterium marinum. The rare skin infection causes red, tender lumps and if untreated, could require surgery. Outbreak: Thirty cases of Mycobacterium marinum have been reported in the New York Cit area. Everyone who has been infected reported having come into contact with live or raw seafood at Chinatown markets . Warning: Health Department officials are telling venders and buyers to wear waterproof gloves when handling seafood at the Chinatown markets in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn . Everyone of the infected admitted to coming in contact with live or raw seafood sold at Chinatown markets in either Lower Manhattan; Flushing, Queens; or Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Dr Jay Varma, the health department's deputy commission for disease control, told 1010 WINS that the outbreak is still under investigation, but that they're warning anyone who comes into contact with the seafood at the markets to wear waterproof gloves. 'This is a very uncommon bacteria so the fact that we’ve detected 30 cases so far suggests that something has changed, either about the water in the tank or the tanks themselves or the types of fish or seafood that are causing this problem,' Dr Varma said. People are more susceptible to getting the infection if they have an exposed cut or wound where the bacteria can enter the body. Tell your doctor: If untreated, the infection could become so serious as to require surgery . Other symptoms of the infection include swelling under the skin, swelling or pain in the hands or arms and difficulty moving fingers. Anyone who experiences these symptoms is being told to see a doctor, as early antibiotic treatment is crucial in clearing up the infection. 'Because this infection can look like any other common skin infection, a number of people have gone weeks and sometimes even months before they’ve had an accurate diagnosis,' Dr Varma said. There is no threat in eating any of the fish sourced form the markets, and it can't be spread from person to person.","Thirty cases of Mycobacterium marinum have been reported in the the New York area so far .

A Detroit-area man who fatally shot a drunk, unarmed woman on his porch will stand trial for second-degree murder and manslaughter, a judge ruled Thursday, rejecting a self-defense argument for the killer's 'bad choice.' There is no dispute that Theodore Wafer shot Renisha McBride, 19, through the screen of his front door in the early hours of November 2. His attorneys said he feared for his life, but Dearborn Heights Judge David Turfe said Wafer had other options. 'We can't allow (someone) to use a bad decision as a shield to criminal prosecution... The defendant made a bad choice,' the judge said. Scroll down for video . Murder: Detroit-area man Theodore Wafer, pictured in court Thursday, who fatally shot a drunk, unarmed black woman on his porch will stand trial for second-degree murder, a judge ruled . Bad choice: Wafer's attorneys said he feared for his life, but Dearborn Heights Judge David Turfe, pictured, said Wafer had other options . Wafer's attorney, Cheryl Carpenter, pointed to Michigan's 2006 self-defense law. 'If someone is breaking into a home there is a presumption that a homeowner can use deadly force,' she argued. 'You don't know how many people are out there... There's violent banging on the front door. We have a man alone in his home.' But Wayne County assistant prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark said it's 'ridiculous' to believe that Wafer was deeply afraid but still decided to open the door and fire instead of first calling the police. 'He shoved that shotgun in her face and pulled the trigger,' Hagaman-Clark said. Wafer, 54, called 911 around 4:30 a.m. and said he had shot someone who was banging on his door. More than three hours earlier, McBride had crashed her car into a parked car in a residential neighborhood, about a half-mile away in Detroit. A witness said McBride was bleeding and holding her head, but that she walked away from the scene before an ambulance arrived. It's still unclear, at least publicly, what she did between the time of the car wreck and her arrival on Wafer's porch. 911 call: Wafer admitted gunning down 19-year-old Renisha McBride, pictured, after she knocked on his door looking for help, and called police soon after saying he had, 'just shot someone on his porch' An autopsy found McBride had a blood-alcohol level of about 0.22, more than twice the legal limit for driving. She also had been smoking marijuana. Her best friend, Amber Jenkins, 18, said they had been drinking vodka and playing cards seven to eight hours before the shooting was reported to 911. Spectators, mostly McBride's family and friends, left the courtroom immediately after the judge's decision. Wafer lingered and appeared dazed as he stood and looked out a courtroom window. He thanked his attorneys and eventually left through a back door. Carpenter told reporters the ruling was a disappointment. Before hearing final arguments, the judge rejected Carpenter's request to play Wafer's one-hour recorded statement to police. It was not introduced by prosecutors when they presented evidence Wednesday. Hagaman-Clark, citing Michigan court rules, successfully argued that the defense could play the video only if Wafer would agree to testify and open himself up to cross-examination. Self-defense: The judge rejected Wafer, pictured, was acting in self-defense . 'I want to go home': Witness Carmen Beasley provided details in court Wednesday about the hours preceding the death of McBride, who she says was scared, dazed and drunk after she had crashed into Beasley's car . 'The videotaped statement is not subject to cross-examination,' the prosecutor said. The news comes a day after a witness testified that the young woman was hurt, scared and confused a few hours earlier when she crashed her vehicle into a parked car. Carmen Beasley provided details about the hours preceding McBride's shocking death. Defense attorneys claimed he feared for . his life, but prosecutors say the shooting was not justified. Beasley said she heard a 'boom' outside her Detroit home about 1 a.m. and discovered that her car had been smashed. She called 911, went outside and found McBride, who had walked away but returned to the scene.McBride was bleeding and pressing her hands to her head, Beasley testified. 'She couldn't find her phone. She was patting her pockets. ... She just kept saying she wanted to get home,' Beasley said. Beasley went back into her house to call an ambulance, but McBride had walked away again by the time help arrived. Emotional: Walter Ray Simmons, father of Renisha McBride, listens to testimony at Theodore Wafer's preliminary examination in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, on Wednesday . McBride was 'discombobulated' and . appeared to be in a 'confused state of not knowing where she was and not . being able to give a phone number or anything', said Beasley, who . believed the young woman was drunk. There was no testimony about where McBride went during the next few hours as rain fell and temperatures dipped to the 40s. But she somehow ended up blocks away on Wafer's porch in Dearborn Heights. Around 4:30 a.m., he called 911 to report that he had shot someone who was 'banging on my door.' A photo of McBride's legs taken by police showed her left foot had broken through the sole of her boot. Detective . Sgt. Steve Gurka said Wafer's Mossberg shotgun was found inside near . the front door with the spent shell still inside the firearm. A gun case was found on the floor in another area of the house. Testifying for the defense, firearms expert David Balash said Wednesday he believes the screen in the outer door was out of its frame before the shot was fired, a theory that suggests McBride may have knocked it out of place and raised Wafer's fears. Prosecutors disagree. The shooting: Experts demonstrated the steps necessary to fire the shotgun during the court examination on Wednesday . Dr. Kilak Kesha, who conducted the . autopsy on McBride, testified that her blood-alcohol level was about . 0.22, more than twice the legal limit for driving, but probably was even . higher before she was shot because levels drop over time. He said she had been using marijuana. Immediately . after Ms McBride's death Wafer apparently claimed he pulled the trigger . by accident, but in recent days his lawyer has said he was in fear for . his life - despite his size. During . cross-examination, defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter focused on . alcohol, drugs and a possible head injury from the car crash. 'Could a person get more aggressive after a brain injury?' she asked. Grieving parents: Monica McBride, left, and Walter Ray Simmons, right, parents of shooting victim Renisha McBride, speak to reporters last month after their daughter's funeral service in Detroit . Heavy burden: Pallbearers carry the casket for 19-year-old shooting victim Renisha McBride . 'That's possible,' Kesha replied, later saying McBride 'absolutely' could have been quiet and withdrawn while drunk. The prosecution implied that no damage or usable fingerprints on the outside door handles or screens indicated the teen was not trying to break in but was, instead, looking for help, according to Fox News. The defense argued back saying the door wasn't tested for prints immediately after the shooting and that it was raining the night of the incident. The court showed pictures from the scene including McBride's crashed car. Experts also demonstrated the steps necessary to fire the shotgun. In the courtroom, McBride's supporters wore shirts bearing her image and the message, 'Don't shoot. Call 911.' They wish Wafer had called police instead of shooting McBride from inside his home.","Judge David Turfe said Detroit-area man, Theodore Wafer, made a 'bad choice' when he shot dead Renisha McBride through the screen of his front door in the early hours of November 2 .

A retired Maine couple has won the state lottery after the same numbers they have played for decades were once drawn before - but they forgot to buy a ticket. Jeanne Gagnon, 66, of St David, finally struck it rich after winning the February 19 Megabucks jackpot worth $3million, and husband Robert, 67, is finally out of the dog house. ‘I had all the numbers, Jeanne Gagnon told the Bangor Daily News. ‘But my husband forgot to pick up a ticket that day.’ Winners!: Jeanne and Robert Gagnon finally won the lottery 37 years after their numbers were first drawn . ‘And I’ve been hearing about it ever since,’ Robert Gagnon told the paper while shaking his head. The couple has been playing the same numbers – 2, 4, 11, 17, 18, 28 – since the lottery began in 1985, and Jeanne Gagnon has even kept lottery numbers taped inside her ‘lottery wallet’ since then. She could not believe her eyes when her son gave her the winning numbers. ‘Two weeks ago he gave me a piece of paper with the numbers and I said, ‘Are you kidding? I think we have it,’ she recalled to the paper. Her husband of 47 years had already gone to bed for the evening, but the son insisted she wake him to share the good news. The excited couple went to the local deli where they have always bought their tickets to claim the prize bright and early the following morning, but were told they would have to go to state capitol Augusta for an official claim. After 27 years, they were forced to wait several more days after a high school basketball tournament claimed all the hotel rooms in the small town, and a vicious ice storm crippled local travel. Avid players: Jeanne Gagnon said she plans to keep playing the lottery because 'you can't win if you don't play' Robert Gagnon was undeterred though, and even suggested they both go down and sleep in their truck. ‘She did not want that,’ he said. She also did not want a lump sum. ‘If we had taken the lump sum we would have lost $700,000 right off to taxes,’ said Jeanne Gagnon. ‘I wasn’t having that.’ The pair opted for annual payments totalling $70,000 each, which will be set aside into an estate that ensures their disabled son is always taken care of, she explained. The only new toys the retirees expect to buy are a tractor-powered snowblower and new garage to house it in, they said.

Several participants in the Carnival parade in the Dominican Republic marched wearing Ku Klux Klan outfits - and the island nation's Ministry of Culture has come out in defense of the outfits following an outpouring of criticism. The culture ministry is tasked with approving groups that are permitted to march in the annual parade, so when a group showed up wearing Klan outfits - which represent hate, fear and oppression against African Americans in the Southern United States - people expressed their outrage. In a series of post on Twitter on Monday, the ministry defended the group's attire by explaining that it was for a portion of the parade dedicated to commemorating historical events. Hate: The Ku Klux Klan represents a dark, painful episode in U.S. history. KKK imagery is widely regarded as offensive (File photo) 'Every group is free to choose their themes, whether using elements of the Dominican identity or universal culture in their costumes,' the ministry tweeted. Another tweet noted that the Dominican Republic is a 'free country' where people are at liberty 'to express their creativity.' The controversy was first reported by El Caribe. In a followup statement, the ministry claimed that the costumes were intended to be critical of the KKK in the U.S., which has a history of violence against blacks, and still exists - albeit in a much smaller capacity than in the past - today. Not everyone was convinced, and many took to social media to voice their disdain. 'If the point was to demonstrate the obscurantism of a historical period, the message didnâ€™t come through!' write Twitter user Nieves Peguero. The Latino Rebels blog caught wind of the story after it gained traction in the Dominican media on Monday. The bloggers were equally outraged. Disgrace: The KKK still exists in the U.S. today, although in much smaller, isolated, powerless sects (file photo) 'If the KKK procession was meant to be humorous or satirical, it obviously failed,' Iris Estrada wrote, as initially reported by the Huffington Post. The Dominican Republic is no stranger to controversial racial issues. Last year, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that eliminated the birthright citizenship to be applied retroactively. This ultimately jeopardized the immigration statuses of thousands of Haitian immigrants and their Dominican-born children, the majority of which are black. According to the Huffington Post, human rights groups estimate that the ruling could strip more than 200,000 people of their citizenship. The Dominican government says those estimates are too high.","The ministry of culture claims the outfits were part of the parade commemorating historical events .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:25 EST, 6 March 2014 . The Texas family law judge who was famously caught on video viciously beating his then teenage daughter has lost his re-election bid. Unofficial returns show Arkansas County voters rejected William Adams in the Republican primary on Tuesday. In November 2011, justices had suspended Judge Adams with pay while the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct investigated the 2004 video which his daughter Hillary had secretly filmed. Scroll down for video . Video controversy: Texas family law judge Williams Adams, pictured left, has failed to win a fourth term, it was his first election since he was famously caught on video viciously beating his daughter Hillary, pictured right . Hillary Adams said she had released the video to compel her father to get help and show that he was unfit as a judge. But . just a year later Adams had his suspension lifted by the Texas Supreme . Court, although he was no longer allowed to preside over physical . domestic abuse cases. Adams . will be replaced on the bench by County Attorney Richard Bianchi, . reports The Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Bianchi didn’t resurrect the . video for political gain, but the result suggests it had had a negative . impact on voters. No Democrats challenged Adams, who had sought a fourth full term. The . nearly eight-minute clip of the beating got millions of views and . showed the judge lashing Hillary on the legs more than a dozen times and . growing increasingly irate while she screamed and refused to turn over . on a bed to be beaten. ‘Lay down or I'll spank you in your (expletive) face,’ he screamed as she pleaded for him to stop. The beating had happened because she had illegally downloaded files from the internet. Warning disturbing content: Watch video here . Reconciled: Hallie Adams, left, and her daughter, Hillary Adams, have reconciled and arrived at court together in 2011 where William Adams was fighting for visitation with his 10-year-old daughter . Neither Hillary – nor her mother Hallie – who divorced Adams in 2007, have commented on Tuesday’s decision. In . the past both had expressed their disappointment in the decisions of . the state commission and Supreme Court not to fire Adams over his . actions. The Arkansas . County district attorney ruled too much time had passed to bring criminal . charges against the judge. The . video posting said: 'Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near . the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent . himself. 'Do not allow this man to ever be re-elected again. His ""judgment"" is a giant farce. Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter.' However, . at one point during the disturbing video, Adams was joined by his wife . Hallie, who took over the beatings, demanding that their daughter 'take . it like a woman'. Mother and daughter have since reconciled. Vicious: The YouTube video showed Texas judge William Adams savagely beating his disabled daughter with a belt 20 times as she begged him to stop . No remorse: William Adams repeatedly denied wrongdoing, claiming he was 'just disciplining my child' and that the video 'looks worse than it is' Miss . Adams - who is now 26 - said of her mother: 'When I showed her the . video, she was so devastated that she could have ever done anything so . awful and wouldn’t stop apologizing. 'My mother was brainwashed by my father. She was a total doormat. They met when they were teenagers.' Speaking . in 2011 about why she finally decided to post the video, she said: 'I . had a feeling that I needed to hold on to it and show it to someone one . day.' 'We were the perfect, normal nuclear family,. Everyone thought he was the perfect person. 'He couldn’t do anything wrong in the eyes of our neighbors. He was two-faced. 'He needs help': William Adams' daughter said her main motivation behind making the video public was to force him to apologise and 'to get psychological help' Brave: Hillary Adams spoke out about the years of abuse suffered at the hands of her father . 'It was the straw that broke the camel's back. It wasn't any huge happening or anything.' To their friends and neighbors the Adams family who lived in Rockport, Texas represented an ideal of wholesome American life. The . image was reinforced by her father's prestigious job, his regular . church attendance and his seemingly happy marriage to his wife Haille. In private, Miss Adams said, he was a different person; controlling, angry and unpredictable. Explaining . how her father acted towards her, she revealed he refused to . acknowledge his daughter's cerebral palsy 'because he felt it would . reflect badly on him', referring to her as 'a retard' when she was . unable to carry out menial tasks such as sweeping the drive. 'I once . forgot to feed the family pet and he kicked me in the garage. I said, . ‘Dad, that’s child abuse’ and he said, ‘You don’t know what child abuse . is’. 'In his job, he would see terrible cases every day, so kicking his own daughter was no big deal.' She . claimed that he deliberately stood on her wrist for long periods and . forced her younger sister, now aged 12, to attend an adult gym because . 'You’re a fat f****** pig.' Because Miss Adams was taught at home . and her bruises were hidden beneath trousers, the abuse went undetected . by the outside world. 'My dad is still saying I wasn’t hurt, which is . a complete lie because I showed him all the bruises, up and down my . legs. I said, ‘It hurts to walk’ and he said, ‘Good’.' Judge Adams . repeatedly denied wrongdoing when the video came out, claiming he was . 'just disciplining my child' and that the video 'looks worse than it . is.' Miss Adams, whose main motivation, she said was to force her father to apologize and 'to get psychological help', . 'I wanted to hold a mirror up to his behavior. I can’t say that vengeance wasn’t at least a small part of it. 'But . I wanted him to be shocked and wanted other people to see it to try and . get him to change. I thought this was a way to get through to him.' Miss . Adams spoke out about her abusive upbringing because she felt it was . important to encourage other children to come forward if they suffer at . the hands of their parents. 'All schools should explain what verbal and physical abuse is as a mandatory part of the national curriculum,' she said. 'Children . need to know what abuse is.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:14 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:20 EST, 6 March 2014 . A Texas judge has ruled that a man who doused a boy with gasoline and lit him on fire when he was a teenager can now be tried as an adult for murder even though the incident took place 13 years before the victim died. Authorities allege that Don Willburn Collins was 13 when he attacked Robert Middleton in 1998 on his eighth birthday near the younger boy's home in Splendora, about 35 miles northeast of Houston. Middleton was burned across 99 per cent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer blamed on his burns. Scroll Down for Video . Brought to court: Don Wilburn Collins, seen here Wednesday, can now face murder charges more than a decade after attacking a former neighbor with acid. The boy survived but died from complications from the burns years later . Back in court: Collins was sent to juvenile detention for a few months immediately after the attack but never had a full trial or faced criminal charges, but that will likely change with the new ruling . Middleton had initially named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998. Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to pursue the case. Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack. The sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case, and prosecutors charged the now 28-year-old Collins with murder last year â€” but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take him to trial. Before and after: Robert Middleton, seen left before the attack, faced constant health problems for the remainder of this life, seen right in an undated photo of him years later . Heartbreaking: He was left with 99 per cent of his skin covered in burns, and eventually died due to skin cancer in 2011 . After a three-day hearing on that . issue this week, state District Judge Kathleen Hamilton ruled that . Colllins' case could be transferred. The ruling enables the prosecutors' murder case against Collins. Colleen Middleton, Robert's mother, said she was relieved the case would go to trial. 'When Robert died we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen, maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him,' she said. 'It's been a long road.' Turning back time: Collins' lawyer said that it is against his constitutional rights to be tried as an adult for something he did when he was a child because so much time has passed in between the attack and now . Seeking justice: Colleen Middleton told how it has been 'a long road' in fighting for the case to go to court . Keeping the focus on her son: Mrs Middleton, seen in the Texas court room on Wednesday, has continued the fight since her son died of skin cancer in 2011 . Several witnesses testified during . this week's hearing that Collins had confessed to them or others that he . had been responsible for the attack on Middleton. Part of Middleton's . taped deposition also was shown during the hearing. In a separate case, Collins was convicted of sexually assaulting another 8-year-old boy. Now an adult, the victim testified during this week's hearing that Collins had threatened to burn him if he told anybody what happened. Collins' attorney, E. Tay Bond, had argued that moving the case to adult court would violate his client's constitutional rights. Bond also questioned the reliability of Middleton's statements, as well as secondhand statements made by other witnesses, saying there was 'no new credible evidence in this case.' Seeking justice: Colleen Middleton came face to face with her son's attacker in October- the first time in 15 years . Bond argued that the case should not be transferred to adult court because under state law in 1998, a juvenile had to be at least 14 years old for a capital felony offense case to be transferred to adult court. The law was changed in 1999 to lower the age to 10. Prosecutors said the crime of murder did not take place until 2011, well after the law was changed. But Bond said the law couldn't be applied retroactively to Collins. Collins, who is being held on a $1 million bond, will remain jailed as he faces up to 10 years in prison for a charge in neighboring San Jacinto County of failing to register as a sex offender.","Latest ruling states that Don Willburn Collins can be tried for murder and sexual assault stemming from an attack that allegedly took place in 1998 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 5 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:33 EST, 5 March 2014 . An Ivy League lawyer has been convicted of the first-degree murder his girlfriend after the violent attack was unintentionally recorded on a friend's voicemail after a pocket dial. Jason Bohn admitted to killing his live-in girlfriend Danielle Thomas but he had hoped to be convicted of manslaughter as opposed to murder. The Queens jury ruled against him, however, and apparently found his tales of childhood abuse were not enough to convince them to decide on manslaughter. Awaiting his sentence: Jason Bohn (left), was found guilty of strangling his girlfriend Danielle Thomas (right) The New York Post reports that 35-year-old lawyer will receive his sentence on April 7. He was also found guilty of tampering with evidence and being held in criminal contempt. He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole. Relatives . of Ms Thomas, a 27-year-old Weight Watchers executive, were emotional . in the courtroom and began audibly crying before the jury entered the . court on Wednesday afternoon. The Columbia University-educated lawyer, whose trial got under way late January, will rely on testimony of Los Angeles-based forensic psychiatrist Alexander Sasha Bardey, who is known in Hollywood circles as a consultant on the TV drama 'Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.' The expert attempted to convince a Queens jury that Bohn was suffering from 'Intermittent Explosive Disorder' and did not know what he was doing when he stomped on and throttled Thomas, a Kentucky native. She went on to place some blame on Bohn's mother, MAureen O'Connell, abandoned her son when he was 10 years old to focus on her career in the publishing business. O'Connell, who according to her corporate profile in Bloomberg BusinessWeek draws annual compensation in the amount of $1.2million, has been footing her son's mounting legal bills. Mr Bardey co-produced Steven Soderbergh’s highly acclaimed 2013 thriller 'Side Effects' starring Rooney Mara as a young wife who kills her husband, portrayed by Channing Tatum, after taking a new anti-depression medicine. Captured: Bohn is brought into Queens Supreme Court in handcuffs on July 23, 2012 after fleeing their apartment with her phone and using it to tell her friends and family that she was 'fine' Brutal death: Miss Thomas had moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend in Queens . During opening statements January 29, prosecutors revealed that Danielle Thomas was afraid for the life of her dog, Schnoozer, and rushed home on the night of her murder to protect him, even though a friend had offered to take her to a hotel. Prosecutor Patrick O'Connor told the jury panel that Bohn had threatened to kill the black-and-white pooch in the past, and Thomas rushed home in a bid to save her pet. ‘It was for the love of her dog,’ the prosecutor said. ‘She was afraid for her dog.’ One of the most compelling pieces of evidence was the unintentional voicemail, wherein Ms Thomas could be heard saying 'I can't breathe' as Bohn strangled her. On the chilling recording, a man believed to be Bohn relentlessly questions why Miss Thomas made a phone call to a number with a 508 area code. Bohn is then heard strangling the 27-year-old before letting go as she pleads with him and tries to answer his questions. Loss: Bohn blamed Miss Thomas' lying, stress, . alcohol and his own abusive past for the murder; in court, the . prosecution said the 27-year-old rushed home to protect her dog, . Schnoozer (right), from Bohn . She struggles to breath as she answers over and over: 'I don't know... Jason, I love you.' He then replies: 'You have five seconds and then...and then I'm going to kill you. He continues: 'I'm going to let you up and then you need to answer quickly or else you die... Danielle, why did you call that number? 'Danielle you are so stupid. You think I'm going to stop, I won't stop.' It is unclear whether the voicemail came from the victim or alleged killer's cellphone. Neighbors called police to check on her after hearing a fight and the woman's dead body was found in a bathtub full of ice. Bohn had fled the couple's apartment in Queens with his girlfriend's phone, which he used to assure her family she was fine. Missed: Bohn, right, had been violent in the . past and Miss Thomas (pictured left with a relative) had a protection . order against him but she worried for the safety of her dog so she returned to the apartment . He sent a text to one of her contacts . saying: 'Please trust me,' adding that Thomas was 'fine' and attending . the weekend’s gay pride parade in Greenwich Village. He . also used the phone to call a former flame, allegedly confessing to her . that he got drunk and unwittingly slammed Miss Thomas against a wall. An autopsy report by the medical examiner revealed that Ms Thomas died of neck compression and blunt-force trauma. He . was eventually tracked down to a restaurant in White Plains five days . after the killing and charged with murder - which was later upgraded to . first degree - and evidence tampering. After he was jailed, Bohn dictated to his brother a self-pitying rant to be posted on Facebook blaming . his girlfriend for the killing. He blamed Thomas, stress, alcohol and his own abuse at the hands of his father for the murder - refusing to take responsibility for his murderous actions. 'I suspected she was a cheater,' he wrote. 'At the . very least, I gradually confirmed she was a compulsive liar, . particularly with regard to relations with the opposite sex, both past . and present. Grim discovery: Danielle Thomas' body was found in the Queens apartment in a bath full of ice in June after neighbors called the police following the noisy fight . Murder scene: Thomas was found murdered in a bathtub of ice at the couple's Astoria, New York home . 'As a result I grew insecure and . abusive. In hines-sight [sic] one of us should've walked away. But, I was already . madly in love with her. 'I was also extremely mad (both meanings).' He described the night he killed her, claiming he got drunk and snapped but 'in all honesty, it was an accident,' he wrote. 'I woke up the next morning in complete shock. 'My knuckles were bruised badly and she was on the floor unconscious,' he added on his Facebook page. Police records show that Bohn has a . history of abuse and had repeatedly threatened Thomas before her . death, saying he would hunt her down 'like a dog in the streets'. When . officers discovered Thomas, they found two handwritten notes in the . couple’s apartment, believed to have been written by . Bohn. The first note . said: ‘It was an accident…I had been drinking and I was drunk when I got . home. She was already asleep. I woke up and there was fighting between . us.

Man of the hour: Dick Cheney was honored at a conservative dinner function in New York City on Monday . Waterboarding has been used as a punch line at a roast held to honor former Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday night. The torture technique was used to gather intelligence from terror suspects following the September 11 attacks and subsequent wars, and Cheney was one of the most powerful advocates for the controversial move. At the dinner, attended by a group of conservative figures, waterboarding was used as a laugh line instead, prompting outrage after news of the jokes was released. Rupert Murdoch was one of the co-hosts . of the event at New York's Plaza hotel, which was sponsored by . Commentary magazine, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, . former Senator Joe Lieberman, and Cheney’s former aide Scooter Libby. Unidentified guests told Buzzfeed that there were several waterboarding jokes made over the course of the dinner, including one from Cheney himself. He . tried to dismiss blame for the off-color joke by attributing it to . something that late night host Jay Leno once said, but it still came off . as awkward and inappropriate. Cheney . joked that he missed the shot during an antelope hunting contest- which . in itself is a play on the fact that the has been involved with two . hunting accidents where he unintentionally hit friends with the bullets . instead of the animals. Rather than killing the antelope with the . bullet, Cheney said, he wanted to waterboard it himself. Their decision: Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Cheney (seen here in 2003) were considered to be the architects of the policy allowing waterboarding, and that was brought up at the Monday event . ‘There were some waterboarding jokes that were really tasteless,’ an unidentified guest said. ‘I can see the case for enhanced interrogation techniques after Sept. 11 but I can’t really endorse sitting there drinking wine and fancy dinner at the Plaza laughing uproariously about it.’ Rumsfeld also took a verbal shot at Cheney and his five heart attacks, saying that they helped because they ‘finally showed the world that he actually has a heart.’ One of the other crass joke came from Lieberman, who is now an Independent but served the vast majority of his time in office as a Democrat. Lieberman ‘said something to the effect that it’s nice that we’re all here at the Plaza instead of in cages after some war crimes trial,’ a guest told Buzzfeed. Though the roast was centered around Cheney, a number of others in his political orbit were the targets of the makeshift humorists. Ribbing from the other side of the aisle: Former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman was one of the politicians asked to roast Cheney, and he made a joke about avoiding war crimes charges (seen here together in 2000) Confidantes: Dick Cheney's former aide Scooter Libby, who was indicted on charges of revealing the identity of a CIA agent (pictured together in 2005), was also selected as a roaster . Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who served during Cheney’s time in office, was teased for his emails being leaked which suggested that he had an extramarital affair. President Obama was mocked for allegedly allowing Russia’s Vladimir Putin dictate American foreign policy. Scooter Libby, who was indicted over the release of CIA agent Valerie Plame’s identity, took a shot at former President Bush- who was notably not in attendance- for failing to pardon him over the charges. ‘Libby said George Bush sent a note, “pardon me, I can’t make it,”’ a guest said.","Former Vice President Dick Cheney was honored at a conservative dinner .

Brotox: Simon Cowell and Rylan Clark have both admitted to freezing time with the help of Botox - and it seems it's catching on with the public too . Speaking about the rise, he said: ‘Men used to book appointments first thing in the morning or late at night so there was no risk of being faced with a waiting room with other people; there was a genuine fear of the stigma attached to visiting a cosmetic surgeon.

'Male patients now visit during peak hours, whether it be on a lunch break for a Botox treatment, or taking an afternoon off for an anti-ageing Fraxel laser session.' The demand for non-surgical treatments showed peaks at certain times during the year, with an influx pre-Christmas and during February bonus season. This is reportedly down to workers aiming to look 'calm and de-stressed'. 'Workers are under tremendous pressure to achieve, and my male patients want lasting results that look natural. 'A . single Botox treatment can last four months while the thought of . applying cosmetics each day is daunting', Dr Alexandrides explained.

Men now account for almost 20 per cent of Botox patients at The Private Clinic’s UK-wide practices. Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'I think it’s fair to say that today men have a more open attitude towards cosmetic procedures. I also think men are now more aware of the treatments that are available to them. 'If we look back 5-10 years, you would find a far lower number of men willing to have cosmetic treatments to improve the way they look; not because they did not want to undergo the procedure, but perhaps because they were embarrassed or did not want others to see them as vain. 'Now, however, perceptions have changed and people don’t associate cosmetic treatments solely with women. 'Also, increasingly men in the public eye are looking younger and healthier far later in life. This is another factor that may be having an impact on the number of men considering the possibility of undergoing cosmetic procedures. 'Over time the age range of men that I have treated with Botox has also widened. Where it was once predominately men in their 30s, now I see more men in their 40s and 50s. I also treat men in a wider range of professions. 'Those whose appearance is an important part of their job, those in competitive environments and those who have to have direct contact with clients or customers every day, are the men I probably see most often. 'The priority for a lot of men is to look subtly younger by removing or reducing the visibility of lines around the eyes, forehead and mouth.'","Peaked pre-Christmas and during February bonus season .

Kerry, from Chichester, West Sussex, died in Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital last Saturday, less than a year after being diagnosed. Love: Kerry Harvey and Matt Biggins pictured in 2011, before she fell ill. They wed in a deathbed ceremony .

She received hate messages last month after she appeared in the campaign to highlight the poor survival rates of pancreatic cancer compared to other forms of the disease. Last night, Matt, 30, said he would be continuing her campaign, adding that he had been ‘humbled’ by the messages of support Kerry’s family has received. He said his wife’s condition had deteriorated rapidly and he and her mother Eileen were told she had just three days left. ‘It was a massive shock,’ said Matt. ‘Kerry hadn’t been that ill but doctors had decided she wasn’t well enough to continue with chemotherapy and she then had difficulty swallowing and her speech was slightly slurred. ‘The doctors told me Kerry’s body was shutting down. ‘We didn’t know how we were going to tell her but Eileen had a long chat with her and explained what was happening.

Chelsea and England defender John Terry has received £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses, including one which was to be his dream home. The footballer, together with his wife and twin children, had planned to live in the nine-bedroom white mansion, which was built next door to his old property. Terry, 33, sold his original red-brick house last year for £5.25million after three years on the market, but then received an out of the blue £16million offer for his new home. He had bought the luxury pad for £1.8million in 2007 and spent a further £4million renovating it, even building a man-made fishing lake in the back garden. Win: Chelsea and England defender John Terry, pictured with his wife Toni, has netted a cool £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses, including one which was to be his dream home . Dream home: The footballer, together with his wife and twin children, had planned to live in the nine-bedroom white mansion, which was built next door to his old property . Terry, whose £170,000-a-week Chelsea contract runs out this summer, bagged a £10million profit on the sale to a mystery foreign investor. The cost of the home is twice the price of the average Surrey property, and the sale of the house has prompted further speculation that the footballer is planning to leave Chelsea in favour of a move abroad. His family are now believed to be renting another property. His spokesman told The Sun that the house had not been put on the market, but that Terry and his wife Toni had 'received a fabulous offer which they decided to accept'. It had taken father-of-two Terry three years to sell his first house, which he had bought for £2.25million in 2003 and reportedly had to re-mortgage four times. In 2010 the former England captain was advised to drop the asking price by three quarters of a million pounds. However, helped by the burgeoning property market, he was finally able to sell it for more than the £5million asking price, helping him finance the second mansion - located just a short drive from Chelsea's training ground in Cobham. Grand Designs: Terry bought the luxury pad for £1.8million in 2007 and spent a further £4million renovating it, even building a man-made fishing lake in the back garden . Constructed at the end of a private road, the huge new home is hidden away from prying eyes and is only clearly visible from the air. It comprises eight dressing and bathrooms, nine bedrooms, a swimming pool and sauna. The mansion even has its own private cinema and sauna. Terry, a keen angler, was given permission to build the fishing lake in April 2012 - despite it being on green belt land. Future plans: The sale of the home has prompted further speculation that Terry, pictured with wife Toni and his twin children in 2010, is planning a move abroad . It all adds up: Chelsea's John Terry was spotted doing some pre-Christmas shopping at Poundworld in nearby Woking by Jack Jeffery last month . Terry was reported to have incurred a mortgage debt of £4.6million pounds on the building of the new house. Construction work started in December 2011 and the finished mansion is believed to include a 33x40ft indoor swimming pool, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities. Staff are also reportedly accommodated in one wing and there is also a visitor annexe in the opposite wing. Not only did Roman Abramovich and Jose Mourinho transform the . fortunes of Chelsea, they also turned the area around the Premier League . club's training ground into the most exclusive in Britain. The . gated mansions close to the west London club's Cobham base had been known . as the ‘gin and Jag’ belt of Surrey but was transformed to the 'Beverley . Hills of Britain' eight years ago. Traditionally it had been an area that attracted the UK's richest bankers, business people and celebrities, but footballers flocked from Chelsea, Kensington and other parts of London to leafy Surrey villages. Leafy idyll: This aerial picture shows the area around footballer John Terry's mansion in Cobham, Surrey, where he is surrounded by other team mates and footballers . John Terry and his Chelsea team mates began decamping to the area in 2005 after . Chelsea's training ground moved to Stoke d'Abernon, near Cobham, after the . then manager Jose Mourinho, now in his second spell, decreed they should all live within minutes of . it. The Special One himself also bought a grand home in the area, where a mansion costs an average of £4.5million, around £200,000 more than a year ago. His captain led the way and then team mates like Ashley . Cole, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, and Fernando Torres bought mansions for themselves and their . WAGS. Terry fell out with Oxshott near-neighbour and once . close friend Wayne Bridge, after an alleged affair . with French underwear model Vanessa Perroncel, Bridge's then . girlfriend. Terry was sacked as England captain. Palatial: Chelsea and England left back Ashley Cole bought a house in the area, left, which he shared with singer Cheryl Cole before their divorce, while the mansion on the right was bought by Wayne Bridge . Oxshott is reputedly the most expensive village in Britain. Like . Cobham it is in the district council area of Elmbridge, which also . includes ­Claygate, Esher and Weybridge, each a couple of miles apart. The . leafy idyll is home to Elton John, Gary Lineker, Jenson Button and Andy . Murray, and residents pay more income tax than any other area of the . UK. The tax man receives £1.18billon a . year from residents of Elmbridge, twice the amount drawn from Cardiff . and Newcastle combined, and 200 times more than from Google. Sportsman: Wimbledon champion Andy Murray owns this home near Cobham, which he shares with his girlfriend Kim Sears . The . footballers' needs, and those of their wives and girlfriends, are well . catered for in the area - even the corner shops stock Dom Perignon and . Krug champagne while traditional shops have been replaced with hair salons. The neo-classical houses on the Crown Estate in Oxshott are a favourite with the players. Each . property is built on half-acre or so, separated from the others by . red-brick walls and swathes of evergreen foliage. Demands: Chelsea's Jose Mourinho told players they had to live within minutes of the club's Cobham training ground, and stars like John Terry led the way .","Chelsea defender received an out of the blue offer for nine-bed mansion .

He goes up against American world champion Christian Taylor - who has leapt 17.96 meters and British athlete Phillips Idowu who has reached 17.81 meters. He made it through the qualifying stages last night, ranking 6th with a jump of 16.81. Laine will compete in the triple jump final on August 9.

The goal is to have future teams made up of athletes who were born and raised in Haiti. Laine said he plans to call on friends, including his roommate-turned-billionaire, to donate a few dollars. 'I hope they see the merits of my cause,' Laine said. 'I will definitely try to reach out to Mark as well.'

Forcing your spouse to wear particular clothes, deciding which friends they can see and ‘excessive jealousy’ could become crimes as part of changes to domestic violence laws, it emerged last night. Ministers are considering whether to make forms of ‘psychological abuse’ which do not involve violence into criminal offences punishable by law. It follows a campaign from women’s groups who say there is too much focus on specific incidents in which someone was hurt by their partner. Ministers are considering whether to make forms of 'psychological abuse' which do not involve violence into criminal offence sas part of changes to domestic violence laws . Instead, they said, crimes of domestic abuse should include non-violent acts against wives or husbands. But last night, criminologists warned that any definition of abuse that included non-violent acts would hand huge ‘arbitrary’ power to the police. Dr David Green, director of the Civitas think tank said: ‘Lots of couples are going to exchange angry words from time to time but there’s not the least chance of it turning into a fight. For others a raised voice or a fierce glare might be terrifying.’ He warned: ‘It’s very easy for society to slide in to a kind of police state where police can define something as against the law when in reality they are a bit of a barney but not something the police should get involved in. Forcing your spouse to wear particular clothes, deciding which friends they can see and 'excessive jealousy' could become crimes . ‘Before you know it you could be in a Police State where a little bit of aggro could lead to the police being involved and someone being carted off to the police station.’ The proposals were published yesterday by the Domestic Violence Law Reform Campaign, which said existing laws fail to take into account ‘power and control’ in relationships. It is calling on ministers to criminalise ‘coercive control’ and behaviour which causes psychological harm. Laura Richards, director of Paladin said: . ‘It is possible for the law to criminalise a course of conduct and move . beyond physical injury.’ Campaigners from women's groups say there is too much focus on specific incidents in which someone was hurt by their partner . She said the law should take account of a ‘course of conduct’ and ‘address a broad range of harm’. Polly Neate, chief executive of Women’s Aid said the criminal justice system was wrongly focused on ‘individual incidents of physical violence’ and failed to reflect the ‘ongoing psychological harm caused by coercive control in intimate relationships.’ A survey of abuse victims carried out by the campaign group found 94 per cent of those surveyed said mental cruelty could be worse than physical violence. The Home Office’s own definition of domestic violence already includes ‘coercive control’ - but until there has been no move towards making them a criminal offence. This coercion can include being excessively jealous, stopping someone from seeing family and friends or controlling what the victim wears. Last night Home Office officials confirmed the proposal would be considered as part of a review of how the police deal with domestic violence. It will be examined by ministers alongside a report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary into how forces are investigating such crimes. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: ‘The government is committed to working with the police and other criminal justice agencies to ensure the response to domestic violence and abuse offers the best possible protection to victims. ‘The Home Secretary has commissioned Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to conduct a review across all police forces of the response to domestic abuse. ‘We will carefully consider the case for any change to the law against the backdrop of HMIC’s findings and recommendations.’ In September 2012 the government’s definition of domestic violence and abuse includes ‘psychological, financial and emotional’ factors. It includes ‘isolating’ someone from sources of support, exploiting their wealth  and ‘regulating their everyday behaviour’.","Ministers considering making 'psychological abuse' punishable by law .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Kieran Corcoran . PUBLISHED: . 07:26 EST, 6 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:48 EST, 6 March 2014 . 'Significant discount': Mr Cohen said he could earn twice as much money at a commercial channel . One of the BBC's highest-paid executives last night defended his huge pay packet and said that his £320,000 licence fee-funded salary was at 'a significant discount'. Danny Cohen, the Corporation's Director of Television, even said that he could earn twice as much money elsewhere. His comments came as news leaked that youth channel BBC Three, which he was once in charge of, would be pulled off air to make savings of £65million. Mr Cohen, who was the Controller of BBC Three and BBC One before being given control of the entire television output, is responsible for shows including The Voice, Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who. While in charge of BBC3 he was criticised for commissioning ‘trashy’ shows including Snog, Marry Avoid and Hotter Than My Daughter. Speaking at a fundraising event for charity World Jewish Relief, he said: 'The executives continue to be well-paid, . but if we went to commercial organisations we'd be paid roughly double. 'So we take a significant discount on what we would make if we were . working in commercial organisations.' Mr Cohen also attacked recent Press investigations into the cost of BBC senior management, saying a report by the Sunday Times suggesting that 82 senior staff earn in excess of £150,000, was inaccurate. 'We've reduced our senior management bill very considerably', he insisted. Plans for cutting the channel were fleshed out today, as director-general Tony Hall said it is 'the right thing to do'. The channel will be replaced with a BBC1 +1 service and many of its shows will be also be shown on BBC1 and BBC2. £450,000 : Tony Hall, Director General . £395,000 : Anne Bulford, Managing director of finance and operations . £340,000 : James Harding, Director of news and current affairs . £320,000 : Danny Cohen, Director of television . £320,000 : Lucy Adams, HR director . £295,000 : James Purnell, Digital and strategy director . In an email to staff, Mr Hall said: 'I believe it’s the right thing to do: young audiences - the BBC 3 audience - are the most mobile and ready to move to an online world. 'Twenty-five per cent of viewing by 16 to 24 year-olds is to catch-up or other screens and over the next few years we expect that to reach 40%.' Mr Hall said he could not 'rule out' further changes to 'programmes or services'. In the same announcement, Mr Cohen said the move was 'the biggest strategic decision the BBC has made in over a decade'. He added: 'In an ideal world we would not be making this move for a few more years. Given an entirely free hand, I would make this change in about four or five years’ time, using the years between now and then to slowly shift the balance between linear and on-demand BBC3 content. 'That would be a safer, less risky strategy. But we don’t have the choice to wait and do that due to the investments we need to make.' Little Britain was one of the programmes which started on the channel and went on to become a huge success . The channel has been known to air a number of programmes with provocative titles, including Snog Marry Avoid? Meanwhile, BBC stars have also threatened to start a campaign against the closure. Yesterday, Radio 5 Live presenter Richard Bacon threatened to stage a similar campaign against the proposed BBC3 cut to the one that saved the future of BBC digital radio channel 6Music. He said: ‘BBC3 makes lots of great, clever, distinct programmes. If the rumours of it being cut are true, we might need to retool that 6Music campaign.’ Comedian Russell Kane, who regularly presents the BBC3 show Live at the Electric, claimed the channel was the ‘crucible of upcoming comedic artists’. Presenter Greg James, who also regularly appears on the channel, said: ‘Such a load of balls if the rumours about BBC3 being axed are true. Brilliant new comedy and live music needs that platform.’ Despite the protests of BBC staff, others have supported the proposal and expressed relief that Lord Hall will at least save BBC4, which has also been under threat. Plans: Director General Tony Hall today confirmed plans to pull BBC3 off air . The high-brow station, which has an older audience, had been seen as the other main contender for the axe. On the BBC’s online message board, Points of View, the overwhelming majority of viewers said they would prefer BBC3 to be scrapped rather than see BBC4 disappear. One said that BBC4, which mainly broadcasts documentaries and arts programmes, is ‘too good to go’, while another added: ‘BBC3 should go. Its programmes are pretty puerile.’ BBC3 was set up in 2003 and has launched comedies such as Little Britain and Gavin and Stacey. But other programmes, such as Snog, Marry, Avoid?, have been less popular with critics, and it has been accused of showing endless repeats of EastEnders and films. Its viewing figures are also much lower than other BBC channels, rarely topping 800,000, while its target audience of 16- to 34-year-olds watch more online television than older viewers. Responding to Mr Cohen's comments, a BBC spokesperson said: 'We have reduced senior managers’ pay bill by more than 30 per cent since 2009. 'The BBC has a policy of discounting executive salaries by between 50 to 80 per cent against the commercial sector.' BBC Three started broadcasting in . 2003 and has been the launch pad for some of the corporation's biggest . shows, along with some of its most controversial. THE HITS .

Fraternities are more powerful than the colleges and universities that host them, according to a new expose into their relationships with schools. The influence on campuses of fraternities is immense, from masses of off-site student housing to donations, fraternities control many aspects of life, according to an article in The Atlantic this month. The Atlantic also uncovered surprising numbers about crimes committed in fraternity homes – violence is the biggest problem, followed by sexual assaults and intoxication. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A familiar sight: Fraternity and sorority rush (recruitment) signs are usually posted across campuses at the beginning of each semester . ‘In many substantive ways, fraternities are mightier than the colleges and universities that host them,’ Caitlin Flanagan wrote after a year looking into the notoriously private organizations referred to as ‘Greeks’ for their use of the Greek alphabet in official names. Fraternities soldier on through numerous hazing scandals because one out of every eight American college students lives off-campus in a fraternity house. Off-campus housing relieves schools of costs involved with maintenance and insurance, and allows them to shift resources elsewhere. ‘Getting rid of all that housing would be a huge problem for the colleges,’ Flanagan told CBS News. The risk, though, of having all those students off-campus is that schools don’t supervise students as they do in dormitories. No rules: Many fraternities post rules of conduct, but members rarely follow them - excessive drinking and drug use often occurs . This has led to dramatically higher incidents of assault and battery and sexual assault, The Atlantic’s year-long investigation revealed. ‘These kids get liquored up and they get in horrible fights,’ Flanagan continued. ‘There's a kid in a coma in Pennsylvania… Somebody punched him, roundhouse punch. He hit the cement, and he's in a coma.’ That student was pummeled trying to break up a fight. The second-most committed crime is sexual assault, but Flanagan revealed fraternities are fairly transparent about the number of sexual assaults and more often than not deal with them appropriately. Hazing is also surprisingly not nearly the problem many perceive it to be. ‘I had assumed before I wrote the piece that hazing was the number one problem… [but] hazing is the least common problem, it's only seven per cent,’ she said. Not surprisingly though, many of the issues facing fraternities can easily be traced back to binge drinking - even non-violent or hazing-related deaths. Perception flying in the face of actual reality has forced one fraternity to ban pledging beginning this Sunday, CBS News reported. The off-campus institutions are able to continue on despite all these issues because colleges don’t want to shoulder the cost of housing the influx of on-campus students that would result from such a move, but also because they are worried about funding. Another familiar sight: Police tape blocking the front entrance an off-campus fraternity house, this one in New Brunswick, New Jersey, near Rutgers University . Fraternity members often give to both their school and their Greek organization. Removing Greeks from schools would result in alums of both limiting donations. ‘If a college president does something to the fraternity chapter that the fraternity men don't like, they'll cut the money off instantly,’ Flanagan said. Many successful people, including CEO’s, CFO’s, senators, governors and even a few Presidents pledged fraternities during their college years, the article notes. ‘College presidents aren't as powerful against fraternities as people often think.’ The schools also face the dilemma of not realistically being able to limit students’ off campus behaviors. ‘The university can't come and say, 'You can't belong to a private club that exists on a private land,’ Flanagan explained. ‘It's sort of like saying, 'You can't go to 7-11 off-campus,' she continued. ‘You can go to 7-11, you can go to the Elks Club, you can join the fraternity.’ And students do by the thousands each semester, something that will likely not change any time soon.","A new expose on Greek life aims to prove that fraternities wield more power than colleges or universities .

They were once stalwarts of their community - he a high-rolling anesthesiologist, she a world expert on a species of giant waterlilies. But on Monday, a bedraggled William Styler III, 65, and his wife Nancy, 62, were hauled from their Colorado motel room and arrested for allegedly killing an Aspen socialite and shoving her in closet. Now friends, attorneys and former colleagues have revealed how illness, debt and lengthy court battles sent the once-successful couple down an apparently ruinous and desperate road. They are the only suspects in the death of Nancy Pfister, who was found dead four days after she returned from an extended trip to Australia. Before her return, she had complained on Facebook that her tenants - the Stylers - had not paid for $4,000 rent or taken care of her home. Old life: William Styler, a former physician, and his gardening expert wife Nancy look relaxed as they smile for a photo. The couple have now been accused of murdering a woman in Colorado . Sheriff Joe DiSalvo has not released a . cause of death or revealed how long the body is believed to have been . in the closet before it was discovered on February 26. But . residents - many of whom had partied with the Stylers at a party . Pfister threw at her home in November before going away - and Denver . friends said they were shocked by the arrests. 'They never demonstrated any kind of edge,' Dr. Joel Cooperman, a former neighbor, told the Denver Post. 'Neither of them displayed any kind of behavior that would indicate they would do anything like this.' 'I would laugh to think that that’s what they were involved in. They can't be,' Ned Ingham, a former neighbor, told CBS. 'I am totally floored. It would the last thing I’d ever think.' Dr . Styler, known as Trey, was an anesthesiologist and the chairman of St. Joseph Hospital's Department of Anesthesiology in the 1990s. New life: The couple are accused of killing an Aspen socialite whose . home they were renting. Records have shown the couple have had money . struggles while William Styler has had health issues . Loss: Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead last week - four days after she returned from a trip to Australia . The couple, who have a son, lived in . the Greenwood Village area until about eight years ago, when Styler was . hit by a chronic illness. He quit his medical practice and his license . expired in 2005. Afterwards, he turned his attentions to helping his wife in her full-time gardening career. She . founded the Victoria Conservancy and provided lilies to gardening . entities around the world, becoming known as a leading expert on the . variety of an 8-foot species called Victoria. They also welcomed school . children into the garden to look at the flowers and their pond. 'They would have people from all over the world over there,' neighbor Ned Ingham said. 'They were known famously for their flowers.' A . photographer, Povy Kendal Atchison, spent time photographing the . Stylers' gardens and the couple for business shots at the time 'things . were going south for them'. Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at a motel on Monday afternoon . Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found . She . told the Denver Post that they seemed like they were good people until . their money started running out. Court documents reveal the extent of . their troubles. In . 2003, Styler had taken his previous company, Colorado Anesthesia . Consultants, to court in a dispute over software Styler had co-created, . but he lost the case. He . accused his lawyer John Powell, whom he had paid $600,000, for . overcharging him for legal services - and in 2010, Styler sued Powell . for the debt, the Aspen Times reported. He . won and Powell was put on probation and ordered to pay $800,000. But . before the Stylers got the money, Powell filed for bankruptcy, . protecting him from having to pay the . debt. The report in the . Aspen Times says that the scandal led Styler to express suicidal . thoughts, including telling an attorney that he wanted to commit . 'suicide by cop'. In court: Nancy Styler is escorted by two deputies to Pitkin County Courthouse on Tuesday . Locked up: Styler, pictured heading to court on Tuesday, and his wife are being held without bond . 'It was very devastating to him,' said Paul Gordon, a Denver attorney who represented Styler. Last summer, Powell complained to the state's Attorney . Regulation Counsel that Styler was observing his house - and Styler responded that he was trying to find out if Powell still lived there . As . recently as November last year, Styler had written to the . court’s Attorney Regulation Counsel about his frustrations in collecting . money - the same time he was renting the property from . Pfister. When she returned from Australia and . evicted the couple nearly two weeks ago, they had been staying at the . Aspenalt Lodge in Basalt, where rooms cost $119 per night. On Monday, William Styler was taken . from the motel still wearing his bathrobe, while his wife was seen with . tears streaming down her face. Missed: Pfister, pictured right with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills . Heartbroken: Pfister's daughter Juliana said that had to be something more to her mother's death . They appeared in court on Tuesday - . William Styler in a wheelchair - where they were ordered to be held . without bond. They will next appear in court on March 17. Well-connected: Nancy Pfister was once briefly engaged to actor Michael Douglas . Nancy Pfister's remains were cremated on Monday and relatives and residents are holding a memorial service for her on March 15. Her murder - the first in Pitkin County, Colorado in more than a decade - has rocked the small ski resort town, where residents said Pfister had been a popular, well-connected resident. 'She'd been one of the golden girls of Aspen, seriously into the party scene [in her youth],' a source told Page Six. 'She hung out with the Kennedys, Jack Nicholson, Cher, Michael Douglas.' The source added that Pfister was even once briefly engaged to Douglas. Pfister's . daughter has said she refuses to accept her mother could have been . killed over a tenant dispute - and apparently further evidence that the . couple had money troubles. 'How . could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house? There’s got to be something more. It's hard to understand that', her . daughter Juliana asked, ABC News reported. Her daughter Juliana added that her mother had been a beloved member of the community. 'I . have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to . her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or . hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' Pfister said.

Action: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has signed a bill prohibiting 'upskirt' photos of women . Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has signed a bill prohibiting 'upskirt' photos of women just two days after the state's highest court ruled that taking photos of a woman's private parts was legal in certain circumstances. Patrick's office said the governor signed the measure today, after the Supreme Judicial Court controversially overruled a lower court which upheld charges against a man who took cellphone photos up the skirts of female subway passengers in Boston. Michael Robertson was arrested in August 2010 by transit police who set up a sting after getting reports that he was using his cellphone to take photos and video up female riders' skirts and dresses. On Wednesday, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that Robertson did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude, even though they did not consent to the photos. The court said that existing so-called 'Peeping Tom laws' protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude, but the way the law is written, it does not protect clothed people in public areas. 'A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is ""partially nude,"" no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,' the court said in its ruling. State law 'does not apply to photographing (or videotaping or electronically surveilling) persons who are fully clothed and, in particular, does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the MBTA,' the court said. However, the ruling immediately prompted top Beacon Hill lawmakers to pledge to update state law. 'Upskirt': Now in Massachusetts, it would be illegal to take a photo up this woman's skirt even though she clothed . Lawmakers yesterday approved legislation to crack down on those who secretly take photographs of 'the sexual or other intimate parts' of men, women and children in public. 'It is sexual harassment. It's an assault on another person whether it's a child or an adult,' Senate President Therese Murray said moments after the Senate unanimously approved the bill. 'Women and children should be able to go to public places without feeling that they are not protected by the law.' The legislation says anyone who 'photographs, videotapes or electronically surveils' another person's sexual or intimate parts without that person's consent would face a misdemeanor charge and a maximum penalty of two-and-a-half years in jail and a $5,000 fine. The crime becomes a felony with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for photographs or recordings of a child under 18. Peeping Tom: Michael Robertson (pictured) was arrested in August 2010 for using his cellphone to take photos up female riders' skirts and dresses . Distributing such photos would carry a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Murray said those who take such photos sometimes post them on pornographic websites. House Speaker Robert DeLeo said the Legislature moved swiftly after the Supreme Judicial Court issued its ruling on Wednesday. 'Not only did we get it done quickly, but I think there was a feeling that we did it right,' he said. 'We wanted to make sure that this would be a law that would pass all legal questions that could arise.' In the past three years, MBTA police have investigated 13 'secretly photographing' cases. In some cases, the alleged offender was issued a court summons. Some remain open investigations.","Lawmakers yesterday approved a bill that criminalizes secretly taking photographs up women's skirts .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:21 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 7 March 2014 . An Arizona court has heard the voicemails that a former socialite left for her ex-boyfriend after she allegedly hired him to kill her ex-husband so that she could cash out on his $2million life insurance policy. Pamela Phillips is on trial for the murder of her ex-husband Gary Triano who was killed in 1996 after a pipe bomb exploded when he got into his car at a Tucson country club. State prosecutors have accused Phillips, now 56, of hiring her ex-boyfriend Ron Young to kill Triano. Young has already been found guilty and is serving two life sentences in jail but jurors were instructed not to consider that during Phillips' case. Her turn: After two weeks of listening to the prosecution, Pamela Phillips' defense team will be given the chance to explain why they believe she is not guilty for arranging the pipe bomb that killed her ex husband . She has pled not guilty to the charges, but the prosecutors ended the first two weeks of the trial by playing recordings that Young secretly taped of their conversations. 'I wanted to tell you thank you because you're a great friend...The other thing is... is it looks like the money is gone,' she says in one tape. Upset: On Thursday, the Arizona court heard recordings that Phillips' ex boyfriend Ron Young (pictured) made when he was calling her about payments for the bombing . 'I'm not able to send you more money, I mean, there's, you know we need to talk about this.' Even though Phillips and Triano, a real estate developer, were already divorced at the time of his death, she was still listed as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy so she was awarded $2million after the bombing. By that time, Phillips had moved to Aspen and was indulging in expensive trips so the prosecution alleges that she was not able to keep up with her monthly payments to her reported hit man. He became upset and began recording their phone conversations. In one recording that the court heard on Thursday, he tries to get her to admit her role but she brushes it off. 'You know what I'm just aggravated. Would you just leave me alone? Just leave me alone,' she is heard saying. 'Am I bothering you?' Young responds. 'Right now, you are. I've gotta go I've got kids down at the pool. I've got company at four-' 'Well you bothered me for some help so you could get rich, so,' he says. 'Will you leave me alone? Goodbye.' At no point in the recordings does she confess to having a role in the bombing. Her defense team revealed during the opening statements that they plan to show that she did not need to kill her husband because she had little to gain from the death of the father of her two children. Prosecutors presented a wildly . different theory of a woman who grew accustomed to the high life and . found herself struggling financially with an easy way out. Scene: The prosecution contends that while Phillips was not at the Tucson-area country club when her ex husband Gary Triano was killed in 1996, she paid Young to plant the bomb . 'There . is one reason that Gary Triano was murdered. One reason. He was . murdered because his death benefited Pamela Phillips in a big way - . $2million is a hell of a motive,' prosecutor Nicol Green said. On Monday, the trial will turn to her defense team and they are expected to take up to a month- double the amount of time that the prosecution needed- to make their case. Her attorneys have submitted a list of more than 100 possible witnesses who may be called to testify on her behalf. One of those witnesses is Ed Kinnear, the diplomat father of actor Greg Kinnear. Triano was a developer who made . millions investing in Indian bingo halls and slot-machine parlors in . Arizona and California before Congress authorized tribes to open . full-blown casinos. But after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests, Triano went broke. That's around the time Phillips filed for divorce, prosecutors say, because Triano could no longer support her expensive tastes. Back in the day: The prosecution has painted Phillips, seen left in an undated photo, as a gold digger who left her real estate developer husband Gary Triano (right) after he lost much of his fortune . In court: Phillips was arrested in Austria in 2009 and extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time (pictured on February 19) 'All of a sudden, the lifestyle that this defendant insisted on and expected was no longer there,' Green said. She . eventually moved to Aspen and worked in real estate before meeting . Young. The two would soon hatch a plan to kill Triano and collect on the . policy, Green said. 'They were talking about it for years,' Green said. Young later left Aspen while being investigated by police for fraud, and turned up in Tucson briefly in the summer of 1996. 'The reason he comes to Tucson was that he and Pamela Phillips had already agreed to kill Gary Triano,' Green said. After . the killing, Young was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in . Colorado on fraud charges while Phillips was sending him money for the . hit, eventually adding up to $400,000, Green told jurors. The . investigation into Triano's killing stalled until Young's arrest in . 2005. Authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial . transactions with Phillips, including recorded telephone conversations . and invoices. Police also found divorce records pertaining to . Phillips and Triano in a van rented by Young. That's when Young and . Phillips became the key suspects. She was arrested in Austria in 2009 and . extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was . mentally unfit to stand trial at the time.","Pamela Phillips is heard telling her ex-boyfriend-turned-hitman Ron Young that 'there's no money left'

The Supreme Court of Canada on Friday found a Nova Scotia man guilty of sexual assault for poking holes in his condoms before having consensual sex with his girlfriend in order to try to make her pregnant. Craig Jaret Hutchinson's girlfriend, whose name the court has protected, said she had agreed to sex as long as it was with a condom so that she would not get pregnant. The country's top court held 7-0 that while she may have consented sex, she had not consented to unprotected sex, and that by poking holes in the condoms first, he had committed sexual assault. Craig Jaret Hutchinson (right) poked holes in the condoms because he didn't want his girlfriend to leave him . 'We conclude that there was no consent in this case by reason of fraud... Mr Hutchinson is therefore guilty of sexual assault,' Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and Justice Thomas Cromwell wrote in arguments joined by two other justices. The other three judges came to a similar conclusion by a different legal route. The written statement of facts presented by the prosecution said that Hutchinson had wanted to get his girlfriend pregnant at the time, in 2006, in order to keep their deteriorating relationship going. Her pregnancy did extend the relationship for a short amount of time but she later got an abortion and broke up with him. After the couple broke Hutchinson told his ex in a text message that he poked holes in the condom. 'I wanted a baby with you so bad,'he wrote in the text message, reports Yahoo News. Hutchinson committed sexual assault because even though his girlfriend consented to sex, she didn't consent to unprotected sex . The complainant ended up pregnant, though it was not clear from the evidence before the court that this was necessarily because of the condom tampering. Hutchinson, who had been out on bail, will now have to serve an 18-month prison sentence. This particular case was held up against the 1992 case of HIV positive Henry Cuerrier of British Columbia who had sexual relationships with two women with whom he didn't use condoms nor did he disclose his disease.He too was found guilty of sexual assault even though the woman tested HIV negative. He was found guilty because not disclosing his HIV counted as fraud. Similarly, Hutchinson's attempt to impregnate his girlfriend was obtained through fraudulent means and therefore criminal.","Craig Jaret Hutchinson poked holes in his condom unbeknownst to his girlfriend who didn't want to get pregnant .

Tom Brokaw has opened up about his ongoing battle against bone cancer and said that he is aware of the toll it is taking on his family. The NBC newsman spoke to his longtime friend David Letterman on his late night show Thursday and told how he has known about his diagnosis for seven months. 'It involves the whole family and it's tricky and it becomes a big strain,' he said. Scroll down for video . Remaining optimistic: Tom Brokaw, who announced last month that he was diagnosed with a form of bone cancer, said that his doctors have given him a positive prognosis . 'We've got the resources and access, and I've got this fabulous family, and so I am much more aware of what other families are going through. 'I'm so conscious of that every day.' Brokaw is supported by his wife of 52 years, Meredith, their three daughters and five grandchildren. The 74-year-old anchor publicly announced that he is being treated for multiple myeloma in February after keeping it quiet since his August diagnosis. The disease affects blood cells in the patient's bone marrow. He is being treated at the famed Mayo Clinic and said that his doctors remain optimistic. 'I'm very pleased with the progress, and that's about as far as I want to go (publicly),' he said. 'As you know, I was keeping it as private as I possibly could, which I intend to continue doing.' Support: Brokaw, 74, told Letterman that his family has been key to helping him through his treatment, as has his continued writing and work . Letterman pointed out that Brokaw has remained active throughout his treatment, and he said that he intends to continue. â€˜Well, that's been therapy for me. I'm writing, I'm working, I've been on this broadcast, I've done other things at NBC- I want to have my other life,â€™ he said. It comes as little surprise that Brokaw was comfortable talking about it to Letterman as the men have been good friends for years. In addition to being two of the best-known figures in Manhattan media, they both also have ranches in Montana.

What began as a bruise became increasingly discolored and painful, he said. When he began to feel numbness in his hand, he sought medical attention on February 14. He was diagnosed with 'acute compartment syndrome,' a condition where blocked blood flow in an enclosed space in the body can have life-threatening consequences. Before his emergency surgery to relieve the pressure, O'Brien said he was warned that amputation was a possible outcome. 'When I woke up,' he recalled, 'I . thought I felt my arm. But unfortunately, things did not go for the . best.' His arm had been amputated above the elbow. Phantom limb pain continues to plague him three weeks later. It's 'incredibly painful,' he said. 'I feel my hand, in a way, more acutely than I ever did when I had it.' His most successful coping device has been a renewed focus on work, he said, which 'got me through a very tough time.'

A man knocked unconscious after being randomly punched in the head early Sunday morning claims he was a victim of the knockout game. Kyle Rogers, 23, of Rockvile Centre, was punched in the back of the head while walking down the Bowery on Manhattan’s Lower East Side and surveillance video back up his claims. Footage made public by the New York Police Department shows a man walking up behind Rogers and sucker punching him while another films the attack that left him with a broken jaw. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Knocked out: Kyle Rogers was left unconscious on a Manhattan sidewalk after the early Sunday attack . ‘I had no defense at all,' Rogers told WABC through his wired-shut mouth. ‘It’s one thing if he was looking me in the face, like squaring up, but, come on, from behind? It’s like a coward move,' he additionally told WCBS. The suspect is described as a black male in his 20s, authorities admit they have little leads and are asking for the public’s help. Rogers said he had just left a bar on Spring Street and was walking north on Bowery when attacked. ‘Putting on my jacket at the one bar, that’s the last thing I remember,’ Rogers told WCBS. He was in an ambulance when he woke up. He landed face first on the sidewalk, causing the broken jaw and a couple of facial lacerations. Caught on camera: Rogers' attacker can be seen rushing up behind him and punching the back of his head . Moment of impact: Rogers doesn't remember being punched, but does remember waking up in an ambulance . ‘I guess when I fell and hit the ground, I split this open, my eyebrow, and my chin from the punch,’ he told WCBS. The knockout game has become controversial after going viral last year. It involves people approaching other from behind and punching them in the head 'for fun'. No money or valuables are stolen in the attacks, people just hurt random strangers seemingly for sport. ‘I live in this neighborhood and people can be crazy, but it doesn’t make me nervous to be out and about,’ one person told WCBS. Another person chalked it up to the dangers of living in a densely populated city. Wired shut: Rogers is barely able to speak after the attack forced doctor to wire his broken jaw shut . ‘It’s the middle of the city, there are crazy people running around everywhere, and when you’re walking around late at night, you just have to keep your head on a swivel and keep an eye on your surroundings,’ said another. Similar attacks have been happening across the city in recent months, and Rogers’ father is pleading with people to bring them to an end. ‘I just want these kids to stop,’ Michael Rogers told WCBS. ‘I want them to understand that it’s not a game. That’s the whole thing. They call it a game, and it’s not a game. ‘People get hurt real bad.’","Kyle Rogers, 23, was attacked at 2:30am Sunday after leaving a Lower East Side bar .

But the Crown Prosecution Service announced yesterday that the case would be discontinued as there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of convictions. Controversial: Spurs fans began using the word themselves after years of abuse at White Hart Lane (pictured) Baljit Ubhey from the CPS said: ‘Although the same words used in other contexts could in theory satisfy the criteria for “threatening, abusive or insulting”, it is unlikely a court would find that they were in the context of the three cases in question.’ Mr Whybrow, from west London, and Mr Parsons, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, were charged with a public order offence following a match in November. Mr Ditchman, from Bishop’s Stortford, Herts, was accused over a match in October. For years Tottenham Hotspur, who have a strong Jewish following, have received anti-semitic abuse from opposition supporters. In an act of defiance, some fans started using the word ‘Yid’ themselves and it often features in chants at their White Hart Lane ground in north London. But police had warned supporters they would take action. The CPS decided it was not in the public interest to prosecute the trio.
