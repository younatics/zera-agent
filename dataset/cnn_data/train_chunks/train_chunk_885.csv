"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . A late goal from substitute Tommy Smith rescued Brentford a point in their opening Sky Bet Championship game against Charlton at Griffin Park, as the Bees made their long-awaited return to the second tier of English football after 21 years away. Igor Vetokele's close-range header in the 64th minute looked to have sealed all three points for the away side in a closely fought London derby, but Smith had other ideas when he drove at goal in the closing stages. The 35-year-old, a free signing for the Bees this summer, cut inside five minutes from the end and whipped a shot towards goal that caught a deflection on its way past goalkeeper Stephen Henderson, to grab the hosts a point.

Goal: Vetokele 64 . Booked: Buyens . Brentford could even have won it in the 88th minute, when midfielder Alan Judge went agonisingly close to completing a remarkable comeback with a curling fee-kick that crashed back off the crossbar. Charlton boss Bob Peeters named four debutants for Saturday's clash at Griffin Park, as former Premier League defenders Andre Bikey and Tal Ben Haim started alongside Chris Solly and Rhoys Wiggins in defence. Vetokele and George Tucudean, also recent additions to the Addicks squad, spearheaded their attack. In the first half Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham, fired wide from 20 yards for the hosts, before Bees keeper Button rescued his side with a fine save to deny George Tucudean from putting Charlton in front.

Johnnie Jackson should have done better but scooped his shot wide from the edge of the box and the first half ended in stalemate. Vetokele served notice of what was to come early in the second half when he twice went close for the visitors. First he forced a superb save from Button with a dipping drive and he then saw his header tipped onto the post a minute later.

Brentford were guilty of poor finishing with Jonathan Douglas and captain Tony Craig both wasting gilt-edged chances, the latter volleying over from close range when completely unmarked. Charlton substitute Callum Harriott hit the bar midway through the second period after a mistake from Button. But it was the hosts that got on the scoresheet five minutes from time, Smith finding an inch inside the six-yard box to smash home with the help of a deflection off a Charlton defender. And moments later Brentford midfielder Judge was left cursing the woodwork when it denied his neatly struck free-kick from stealing all three points for the hosts.","Tommy Smith, a free signing for the hosts following his release from Cardiff, scored in the dying stages to make it 1-1 .

"By . Chrissy Iley . It's one of the world's best-loved stories - how Captain Georg von Trapp, his ex-nun wife Maria and their large brood of children sing their way out of bankruptcy and escaped Nazi-occupied Austria, where the hills are alive with the sound of music, to start a new life in America. The family's story is basically true and was turned into an Oscar-winning film with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews in the leading roles, although the facts were considerably stretched by Hollywood. Three generations later, and some 60 years since the original von Trapps last sang together, four of the Captain and Maria's great-grandchildren - Sofi, 25, Melanie, 23, Amanda, 22 and their 19-year-old brother August - have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together. The von Trapp descendents  Sofi, August, Amanda and Melanie von Trapp, have come together to sing once more . Their grandfather was Werner, born in 1915, and renamed as Kurt in The Sound Of Music movie. Werner's parents were Captain von Trapp and his first wife Agathe, who died of scarlet fever in 1922, leaving her seven children motherless. I meet the young von Trapps in Portland, Oregon, where they now live after their father had settled in Montana. They've been singing together for 13 years, and I ask if they feel it was destined that this was what they would do? Amanda says, 'I don't think so. We were just children having fun, with no sense of destiny.' Explains Melanie, 'Grandfather Werner was a very quiet man, and didn't tell many stories. He died in 2007, but long after he retired he'd come to our house to teach us Austrian yodelling songs and that inspired our love of music. But there was no pressure on us to carry on the family tradition.' 'When we told our parents what we wanted to do they were surprised. They said, ""Really, you want to start singing?""' says Sofi. 'We all loved it so much and we all loved being together.' August adds, 'We can definitely get tired of each other but because we have the same goal we want to make this work. We decided a long time ago if we just learn to get along we can do fun things.' August, who seems older than his 19 years, wrote some of the songs on Dream A Little Dream, the album they've just made with the band Pink Martini. 'We don't plan to sing together for the rest of our lives,' says Amanda. 'For us it's just a fun experience,' adds Sofi, 'but for our great-grandparents it was a means of survival.' Sofi, August, Amanda and Melanie's direct descendents inspired one of the best loved films of all time . After his wife Agathe's death, Captain von Trapp employed Maria Kutschera, a novice nun, as a tutor for his daughter, also called Maria, because she was ill. In the film version, little Maria's name is changed to Louisa, and the older woman is the family governess. She and Georg eventually married in 1927 (not 1938 as in the film), and had three more children. When von Trapp lost most of his fortune in a bank crash, Maria turned the family hobby - singing - into a career and they performed to great acclaim all over Europe. In March 1938, when the Nazis marched into Salzburg, pressure was put on Georg, a World War I naval hero, to command a ship under Hitler. But he refused, and the von Trapps decided to leave Austria. Maria arranged a concert tour in America, where they planned to start a new life. But unlike the film's version, they did not need to climb any mountains to escape. Maria von Trapp, daughter of Austrian Baron Georg von Trapp, was the last surviving von Trapp singer. She died earlier this year . According to the movie, the family give their guards the slip after a show. They're discovered hiding by a young Nazi who threatens to shoot the Captain, but he disarms the boy. The von Trapps make their escape in a waiting car. The Nazis try to make chase but their cars have been sabotaged by nuns. The family then hike over the Alps to Switzerland and freedom. In fact there was no Nazi boy, no chase. The family left by train (the local station was directly behind their house) and made their way to Italy and then to America via London, where they soon emulated their European singing success. Sofi says, 'They came to America and sang for many years to make a living. Our grandfather Werner was about 40 when he finally stopped in 1955. They had no expectations that any of their descendants would start singing. It was a real surprise to the rest of the family when we did.' Maria wrote a book about the von Trapp Family which found its way to Broadway, and then she sold the rights for £3,000 to Hollywood to make The Sound Of Music movie. 'I never met my great-grandmother Maria,' says Sofi. 'She died in 1987, a year before I was born. We know she was a little impulsive, but without her the family would never have survived as a single group. The Captain would have been taken off to war if it wasn't for the singing.' The real Maria could never have foreseen the impact the film would have, and made it clear she did not approve of the exaggerations. Christopher Plummer portrayed the Captain as brusque and harsh with his children. 'Our great-aunt Agathe (renamed Liesl in the film) said he wasn't like that,' says Amanda. 'He really did love his children and was fun to be with. Apparently he packed a really good snowball and played with the kids a lot. But he did blow a whistle to summon them. 'The butler, who was a Nazi although his first loyalty was to the family, warned our great-grandfather that they were planning on taking him off to a camp,' Amanda continues. 'They packed up little bags and pretended they were going on a picnic so neighbours wouldn't be suspicious. The house they lived in was later occupied by the Nazis. Afterwards, they got it back but Maria gave it to a religious order and it became a convent. The Von Trapp family at their home in Vermont in 1946 . 'Now it's a hotel. Maria never turned her back on her religion. She did missionary trips and remained devout and never had much money.' After touring America, their great-grandparents bought land in Vermont. 'They built a music camp and a skiing camp, which are run now by our Uncle Johan,' says Sofi. The Sound Of Music has touched millions of people's hearts. Just say 'Doe, a deer…' and you're flushed with nostalgia and tunes you can sing in your sleep. When they first watched it, were the young von Trapps aware that the little boy playing Kurt was portraying their grandfather? 'Our parents told us, ""That's your grandfather,""' says Sofi. 'But the film had been recorded on two tapes and we lost the second one. The first one ended where Maria flees the house (confused about her feelings after dancing with her employer, the Captain). We didn't know what happened next.' They are proud of their legacy, though. Melanie says, 'Our great-grandfather stood up to the Nazis and said, ""No, I won't be part of what you're trying to do."" That's what meant so much to us and it did make us feel there was a message we were carrying on.' The last surviving von Trapp singer Maria (stepdaughter of the Maria played by Julie Andrews) died earlier this year. 'We were close to her,' says Sofi. 'For us it's fun, for them it was a means of survival' 'She would visit us and she was the most cheerful great-aunt. She was always laughing and had this twinkle in her eye. She would carry her accordion and sing beautiful Austrian folk songs, and she taught us Austrian folk dancing. Maria was the last of that generation who remembered all the old stories. 'She told us the Captain was completely heartbroken when his first wife passed away. They all sang. They went on camping trips and would play instruments, but it was their stepmother Maria who taught them how to harmonise.' Amanda says of their great-aunt Maria, 'She'd always wear a braid of hair over her head, an incredible hairdo. She had a good sense of humour too.' Sofi adds, 'She would come to our shows and when August took a bow at the end she would say, ""I am glad that your hair didn't fall off because it looks like a little roof of straw."" He was so blond.' The four siblings met the band leader of Pink Martini at a Christmas tree lighting event and they began working together. He had some original von Trapp Family records in his collection, and suggested they do In Stiller Nacht (In The Quiet Night), a Brahms lullaby that to the surprise of the youngsters had been a hit for their great-grandparents. 'We had no idea,' says Sofi. The album includes a couple of August's compositions and some Sound Of Music classics - among them Edelweiss, which they sing with Charmian Carr, who played Liesl, their great-aunt Agathe, in the film. They met her in 2010 when they were invited onto The Oprah Winfrey Show to meet the cast who played the family in the film. Julie Andrews was queen-like, they say. They all seem to have wisdom and naivety in equal parts. They've travelled the world and seen a lot, but at the same time seen nothing at all. It's as if they're channelling another age. Their songs could easily have been sung in the 1930s and they would still bring the hills alive with the sound of music.

"By . Jonny Singer . Follow @@Jonny_Singer . Wigan got out of jail with a stoppage-minute equaliser to rescue an opening-day 2-2 draw against Reading in the Sky Bet Championship. The home side had been the better side in the first half and deservedly led at the break through Callum McManaman. But the second half was completely the opposite as Reading completely bossed proceedings. First class: Shaun Cummings celebrates his first career goal but his side were denied a win late on . Two goals in the space of six minutes from Shaun Cummings and Sean Morrison gave the visitors a lead they thoroughly merited. But a stoppage-time goal from James McArthur spared Wigan's blushes - and ensured honours ended even. Reading could and probably should have been ahead from their very first attack. Pavel Pogrebnyak dispossessed Emmerson Boyce and found Ryan Edwards on the edge of the area. His shot was low and true but Scott Carson pulled off a fine save, diving to his left. Then, from Jordan Obita's resulting corner, Nick Blackman hit the near post with a header from point-blank range. With four players on debut it was always going to take Wigan time to get going, but they found their way into the game and took the lead on 27 minutes. Wigan: Carson, Perch, Boyce, Kiernan, Taylor (Fortuné '80), Huws, Cowie (Tavernier - 72'), McArthur, McManaman, Riera, Waghorn (Maloney - 64'). Subs: Tavernier, Ramis, Maloney, Fyvie, Barnett, Al-Habsi . Goal: McManaman, McArthur . Reading: Federici, Gunter, Morrison, Pearce, Cummings, Blackman, Hector, Obita, Taylor (Cox '60), Edwards, (Guthrie '60), Pogrebnyak. Subs: McCarthy, Akpan, Kuhl, Stacey, Tanner . Goals: Cummings, Morrison . Referee: Mark Brown (East Yorkshire) A lovely ball from the back from Boyce found McManaman, whose initial shot was parried by Adam Federici. The rebound fell to Martyn Waghorn, whose shot was half-blocked, the ball falling to McManaman 10 yards out. This time the winger made no mistake, clipping the ball over Federici for his first goal of the campaign. McManaman had been Wigan's best player in the opening half-hour, and the goal merely added to his confidence. The former Everton player wriggled away again down right, only for his cross to be cut out by a flailing Reading leg. Andrew Taylor took on the shot from fully 35 yards and, although well-hit, the shot was always too high. Wigan were just about good value for their half-time advantage - but the second period was all one-way traffic the other way. Blackman evaded Taylor and reached the byline, his pull-back finding Cummings, whose shot from the edge of the area was deflected away. Chris Gunter then fired over the top, before Jake Taylor's effort was blocked. The ball fell to Blackman, whose strike was way over the top. Reading made a double change on the hour mark, throwing on new boy Simon Cox and Danny Guthrie for Jake Taylor and Ryan Edwards respectively. The switch nearly paid immediate dividends as Cox cut in from the left and forced Carson into another save to his right. Carson was again on hand moments later to keep out Blackman's flick header from Obita's cross. The rebound fell to Guthrie 20 yards from goal, but the curled effort was well wide of the far post. Wigan were hanging on at this stage, and Obita's cross somehow evaded Pogrebnyak sliding in at the far post . But Reading finally broke through on 71 minutes when Michael Hector found Cummings, who drilled in from 25 yards. And after Blackman hit the post with a curling effort, the Royals went in front with 13 minutes remaining. A clever free-kick from Guthrie found Pearce unmarked at the far post, and he headed across for Morrison to nod past Carson. But Wigan somehow picked themselves up off the canvas, resulting in McArthur heading home past a disbelieving Federici four minutes into stoppage time.","Callum McManaman puts Wigan in front during first half .

"By . Rebecca English . The ailing, scandal-hit king of Spain announced his abdication yesterday, saying it was time to hand over to a younger generation. Juan Carlos, 76, who has reigned for nearly 40 years, is the third European monarch to abdicate in just over a year. His surprise decision, on the 61st anniversary of Elizabeth II’s coronation, will inevitably spark speculation about the future of the UK monarchy. Stepping down: Spanish King Juan Carlos I yesterday announced he would abdicate in favour of his son Prince Felipe . However, the Queen, 88, has always made clear that she will stand by her promise to serve as Britain’s sovereign for the rest of her life. Juan Carlos – who has undergone five operations in two years – is stepping down in favour of his son, Crown Prince Felipe. A source at the royal palace in Madrid said the king was abdicating for political reasons, rather than due to failing health, as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory. In a television address, Juan Carlos said: ‘I have decided to end my reign and abdicate the crown of Spain. A new generation is quite rightly demanding to take the lead role.’ Modern approach: Princess Letizia. Juan Carlos¿s eldest son, who will become Felipe VI, is married to glamorous former television newsreader . His abdication follows that of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, who handed the throne to her son Prince Willem-Alexander in April last year after 33 years, and King Albert II of Belgium, who stepped down last summer. But experts were quick to stress that events in Spain would have no bearing on Britain. Royal historian Hugo Vickers said that while Juan Carlos is in poor health and has faced a slump in his popularity the Queen is ‘firing on all cylinders’. ‘The Queen is not likely to abdicate,’ he said. ‘We know from various biographies that she was pretty irritated when Queen Juliana of the Netherlands [Beatrix’s mother] abdicated in the 1980s because monarchs shouldn’t abdicate.’ Juan Carlos earned a place in Spanish hearts when he took the crown in 1975. He became constitutional monarch two days after the death of General Franco, helping to smooth the transition from hardline dictatorship to modern democracy. In recent years, however, his popularity has nosedived amid accusations he is increasingly out of touch with his people. In 2012, he was widely criticised for a secret hunting trip to Botswana – where he fell and broke his hip while shooting elephant. His lavish holiday contrasted sharply with the news back at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless. The ill-fated trip also sparked speculation about the nature of his relationship with Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, the German-born aristocrat 28 years his junior who accompanied him. It has long been reported that Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, his wife of more than 50 years, lead separate lives. The king’s younger daughter, Princess Cristina, has been tainted by a corruption scandal involving her husband. The princess has been summoned to answer allegations of money laundering and tax evasion and it is strongly suspected that charges will be brought. Fortunately Juan Carlos’s eldest son, who will become Felipe VI, still enjoys good poll ratings. The 46-year-old is married to glamorous former television newsreader Letizia Ortiz, with whom he has daughters Leonor and Sofia. King Juan Carlos addresses the nation following his abdication at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid. Letizia is both a commoner and a divorcee – indeed she will become the first divorced woman to become a queen of Spain – but has proved popular with Spaniards for her ‘modern approach’ to royal life. rince Felipe is also lauded for his understated lifestyle, although he still has an uphill task convincing his countrymen there is a need for a monarchy. Juan Carlos insisted yesterday that his son ‘embodies stability’ and will be a good servant of Spain.‘He has the maturity, the preparation and the sense of responsibility required to assume the throne,’ he said. The country does not have a law regulating abdication and succession. Television screens show Spain's King Juan Carlos I as he delivers his speech to explain the reasons of his abdication, at a department store in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, today . Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will today chair an emergency meeting of ministers to set out the steps for Prince Felipe to take over. Announcing news of the abdication yesterday, Mr Rajoy said: ‘I’m convinced this is the best moment for change.’ David Cameron hailed Juan Carlos as ‘a great friend to the United Kingdom’. The Prime Minister also wrote to Mr Rajoy to pay tribute to the king. Asked whether there was merit in monarchs abdicating towards the end of their reign, Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron hoped the Queen would remain on the throne. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The PM wishes her the longest and happiest of reigns.’","76-year-old oversaw his country's transition from dictatorship to democracy .

Aides conspicuously refused to rule it out even though they had insisted in April that it was not under consideration, at the same time as William was telling people he wanted to do something involving flying again and was going for his commercial pilot's licence. 'Are you guys volunteers then? How long have you been doing it?' William asked when he met the crew of the twin-engine Bollow 105 helicopter, which supplements the work of two Government-funded air ambulances in Scotland. Alan Bell, one of the founder trustees of the service, which has been operating for just over a year and been called out to about 300 emergencies, said: 'He was very very interested. He knew quite a lot about the air ambulance network in England and Wales.' But the future King said nothing about his own future career plans. 'He never said anything about it but I would certainly welcome him on to the team,' said Mr Pritchard, 46, one of two paramedics who work on board with a pilot, who must have a commercial licence. William, who asked detailed questions about the aircraft and the work of the team, recalled his own flying experiences and learned how the crew give a teddy bear to any child they treat.

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Rebecca English . He may be just 10 months old, but Prince George is already gearing up to fly a plane like his father. And it seems granddad Prince Charles - who was handed a mini flying jacket for the royal infant - didn't know what to think of the prospect. Holding up the gift from Stevenson Campus Air Hanger in Winnipeg, Canada, the Prince of Wales stared for a few moments before finally breaking out into a chuckle. Nervous? Prince Charles stares at the mini jacket for George handed to him by Stevenson Campus Air Hanger . He then breaks out into a chuckle clutching the gift before setting off for a day of activities with Camilla . George's father, Prince William, has been an RAF pilot for five years, and is now training to pass his commercial flying licence. And with his new jacket, it seems the little infant is all set to carry on the tradition. Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, received the gift on the fourth and final day of their Royal tour of Canada. Earlier, the couple celebrated the centenary of Winnie the Bear - the inspiration for AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories - in the Pavilion Gallery Museum. Later, the couple were treated to a game of paper aeroplane-throwing with Prime Minister Stephen Harper . Camilla laughed as her aeroplane flew towards the cameras, while Charles deliberated on his target . The prince joked with photographers after his aeroplane went flying in their direction . The original Winnie was a female black . bear who was bought as a small cub for $20 in Ontario by a Lt Harry . Colebourn of The Fort Garry Horse, a Canadian Cavalry Regiment, en route . to the Western Front during the First World War. The . bear was smuggled into Britain as the regiment's unofficial mascot with . veterinarian Lt Colebourn naming her after his home city of Winnipeg. Before leaving for France he decided to leave her at London Zoo where she become something of a local star and much admired, among others, by AA Milne's son, Christopher Robin. Christopher Robin subsequent changed the name of his own teddy from Edward Bear to Winnie the Pooh, providing the inspiration for his father's much loved books. Rounding off the visit, they celebrated the bear that inspired Winnie the Pooh and received this gift for George .

"By . Rebecca English . A dapper Prince Harry attended a glitzy summer party on Wednesday to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his charity, Sentebale -  without a date on his arm. The newly single royal, who split with his girlfriend of two years, Cressida Bonas, last week, was at the Dorchester Hotel in London to mark his charity’s achievements working with Aids orphans and disadvantaged children in the African kingdom of Lesotho.

Prince Harry and Sentebale ambassador Joss Stone at the  summer party . Among the stars at tonight’s glitzy event was singer Joss Stone, who recently visited some of the charity’s projects in Africa and will entertain fellow guests. Other star turns include magician Troy and singer Beverley Knight. Harry's cousin Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn were among the guests as were Westlife singer Kian Egan and wife actress Jodi Albert. The evening will also see Harry give a short speech and hand out awards honouring key individuals and organisations that have supported his charity over the past decade. The seed of Sentebale was first planted in 2004 when the prince spent two months in the impoverished African kingdom of Lesotho during his gap year. He had been invited to visit the land-locked country located within South Africa by a member of its ruling family, Prince Seeiso, a friend of his mentor, ex-army officer Mark Dyer. The young prince leant in for a kiss as he arrived at the summer bash for the charity, which also works with  disadvantaged children in the African kingdom of Lesotho . The evening will also see Harry give a short speech and hand out awards honouring key individuals and organisations that have supported his charity over the past decade . The charismatic prince addresses the crowds at the tenth celebrations for Sentebale.

The experience made a lasting impression on the young royal, who was then aged 19. Not only did Harry come face-to-face with hundreds of Aids orphans but he also visited herd boys living a harsh existence in remote mountain areas looking after cattle. Two years later he returned to set up the charity Sentebale - which means forget me not in the local Basotho dialect - with Prince Seeiso to help youngsters in need.

The centre will act as a flagship for all of Sentebale’s work in the country. Harry, 29, recently gave up his job as a frontline Apache helicopter pilot to take a London-based desk job with the army and concentrate on his royal duties and charitable initiatives. Last week sources confirmed that he . had unexpectedly split from his girlfriend, ex-dance student Cressida . Bonas, with friends suggesting that the 25-year-old found it difficult . to live under the spotlight of being a royal girlfriend. Despite . his heartache Harry ploughed ahead with plans to attend the wedding of . his close friend, Guy Pelly, in the US. The pair were seen partying at a . nightclub in Miami in the early hours of the morning before taking a . private jet to Memphis for the weekend ceremony.

Diana, pictured in 1990, was a tireless campaigner for Aids victims . The evening opened with an enchanting performance by the Basotho Choir who sung a selection of traditional songs punctuated with warbling cries Prince Seeiso opened proceedings and talked of his 'beautiful, mountainous landlocked country' - but one that had been ravaged by poverty and disease.He spoke about Harry's first visit to Lesotho and how they had travelled to the 'furthest reaches' of the country to visit children orphaned by Aids. 'Harry and I know what it is like to lose a parent, or parents in my case, and it is a combined desire to carry on our mothers' legacy of work that formed Sentebale,' he said. He also revealed that Harry had been given a Lesotho name on the day he arrived in the country - Mohale, which means hero. In his speech Harry highlighted the ravages of the HIV/Aids epidemic which has left Lesotho with the third highest infection rate in the world and one in three of its children orphans. He admitted: 'At times the severity of severe poverty can be overwhelming. 'However it is through the dedication, passion and commitment of the Sentebale team, our community partners, local government - the children's longing to learn - and you tonight that we are battling with these issues and giving these children a chance of a happier future.' The prince highlighted the case of a young girl called Mpolokeng, whom he met in 2001 and whose mother died of Aids shortly afterwards leaving her to care for her siblings. Thanks to Sentebale's help she has been receiving a £250 annual  bursary to attend school.'That really is a small price to pay to change a little girl's life,' he said. 'What a difference we can make if we all work together.' Guests at the event dined on rump of lamb with cauliflower brûlée, minted pea with baby gem and braised lamb pie and a trio of flaming vanilla creme brûlée, mango sorbet and strawberry pavlova. Westlife singer Kian Egan said of the night: 'Let's face it, if you get an invite from Prince Harry you don't say no. But my wife and I are hugely proud to be here to support his work. It's a remarkable charity.'","Newly single royal at Dorchester Hotel to mark 10th birthday of Sentebale .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The internet has fuelled a rise in sexism and is teaching young boys to think sex should be ‘graphic and violent’, one of the BBC’s top presenters has warned. Kirsty Wark, who co-hosts Newsnight, said teenage girls who have sex are now ‘slut shamed’ by their peers as youngsters become increasingly vicious online. And instead of being given proper sex education by their parents, most of what boys now learn about relationships comes from pornography and violent video games such as Grand Theft Auto. Kirsty Wark, who co-hosts Newsnight, said the internet has fuelled a rise in sexism and is teaching young boys to think sex should be 'graphic and violent' Miss Wark, 59, has investigated the rise in sexism for a new BBC2 documentary, to be screened on Thursday. The presenter said she uncovered evidence the internet has made us more tolerant of sexist humour, including jokes about rape, leading to a ‘new coarseness’ in the way the sexes interact. She told Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: ‘For teenagers now, the internet is as real as the air as they breathe. It is a place without morality. ‘It is hellish for young boys right now. I asked one boy whether he talked to his parents about sex and he looked at me as if I was mad. This is 2014. Why aren’t parents talking to their kids about sex? What he was learning about sex he was learning from his peer group and he was learning from porn. ‘If all you know about sex is graphic sex, some of it violent, how do you form meaningful relationships?’ Miss Wark, who has two grown-up children of her own, said the internet ‘multiplies’ sexism because it encourages people to gather in tribes and target others with cruel abuse. Miss Wark, who has two grown-up children of her own, said the internet 'multiplies' sexism because it encourages people to gather in tribes and target others with cruel abuse . In one new phenomenon, known as ‘slut shaming’, women who show any sexual independence are humiliated on websites such as Twitter and Facebook. She said: ‘The victims, who are now ‘slut shamed’ and humiliated, are the ones who feel the effect – and it’s damaging the next generation by giving them a skewed idea of what prejudice actually is. ‘Sexism is there in full force, along with a rise in people being overtly vicious. 'For older generations, the internet can feel similar to simply ‘pub talk’ – it’s something external – but for young people, the web is part of the discourse of how they live their lives. ‘We’re now fully in the age of the internet. And it appears to be amplifying misogyny.’ Miss Wark also said the internet has fuelled a rise in sexist humour, which makes us more tolerant towards misogyny in our everyday lives. She said: ‘Research from America has shown that if you are listening to sexist humour and are sexist you will be more likely to display sexist humour in your everyday life. 'If you are not sexist and you listen to sexist humour and you laugh, you won’t become sexist, but you will egg the ones on who are sexist. Their views are reinforced. ‘I was also very shocked by the extent to which some of our best known comedians use rape humour. In what circumstances is rape funny? I find that quite extraordinary. ‘When I interview comedians and they say everyone’s fair game and the whole point about comedy is that it’s free speech, it breaks taboos. But there is no taboo around rape, we know rape is awful, we know there’s no excuse for rape. Why make jokes about rape?’ Miss Wark also hit out at ‘cynical’ companies which create online porn and violent video games such as Grand Theft Auto, in which players are encouraged to kill virtual characters. ‘If all you know about sex is graphic sex, some of it violent, how do you form meaningful relationships?’ Kirsty Wark . She said: ‘It is a huge selling game made by very brilliant programmers and a brilliant games company, but as far as I am concerned you don’t have to go to the place in the game where you pay a prostitute, you have sex whatever way you want to have sex with her, which is very graphically detailed. ‘Then in the game if you attack her and stamp on her and kill her you get your money or your points back in the game. The defence is you don’t have to play that part of the game. So why is it there? What makes it so exciting, what makes it such a crucial bit of your enjoyment?’ She added: ‘My naivety was I thought in the Seventies it was the start of this onward progress and the relationship between the sexes would be better. A lot of the times they are, but some of the times they are not. We’re going through a bad moment and I hope we find our way out of it.’ Blurred Lines: The New Battle of the Sexes will screen on BBC2 at 9.30pm on Thursday.","Newsnight co-host Kirsty Wark, 59, said the internet 'multiplies' sexism .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC has been accused of ‘crass insensitivity’ towards the family of PC Keith Blakelock after it allowed the man cleared of killing him to gloat about the circumstances of the officer’s death. Nicky Jacobs – who was last week found not guilty of murdering PC Blakelock in the 1985 Tottenham riots – described the killing as ‘celebration time’ during an appearance on Newsnight. Although he was cleared of any involvement in the murder, the 45-year-old said he wished he had been present when the officer died and accused the police of ‘wickedness’ towards the black community. Nicky Jacobs, who was last week found not guilty of murdering PC Blakelock – described the killing as ‘celebration time. Right, PC Keith Blakelock, who was killed during the riots in the Tottenham Riots in 1985 . Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said Mr Jacobs’ remarks were insensitive and said it was wrong for the BBC to interview him so soon after PC Blakelock’s family had their hopes of justice quashed in court. ‘It is a shame the BBC didn’t think to give PC Blakelock’s family a platform to talk about their pain,’ he said. ‘This interview will be hard for them to hear. It is crass insensitivity. ‘I can only assume Newsnight are trying to boost ratings with their controversial editorial decisions.’ Clearly proud of gaining exclusive access to Mr Jacobs, Newsnight editor Ian Katz ensured the interview gained maximum publicity by promoting it in a series of Tweets before it was screened on Wednesday. An injured riot police officer is helped by fellow officers during the Broadwater Farm riots . During the interview, Mr Jacobs – who was 16 at the time of PC Blakelock’s death – reiterated that he was not responsible for the murder during a riot on the Broadwater Farm estate on October 6, 1985. Despite insisting he was ‘nowhere near’ the crime, Mr Jacobs did admit that, at the time, he wished he had been present. Interviewer Kurt Barling asked him: ‘Was there a moment in your mind at 16 where you thought “Ah, I’ve missed the main event”?’ He replied: ‘It did cross my mind, because like I said at that time the wickedness that the police used to do to the black community, yeah it was celebration time.’ Nicky Jacobs (not pictured), who was cleared of murder, accused police of 'wickedness' towards the black community at the time. Pictured, riot police arrest a man . The 40-year-old officer was stabbed 43 times by a mob as he lay helpless. A 6in knife was embedded in his neck in a failed attempt to decapitate him. Mr Jacobs had been accused of murder after three men claimed they saw him stabbing PC Blakelock. But he was cleared at the Old Bailey last week after the evidence of the trio was found to be riddled with inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Mr Jacobs told Newsnight that PC Blakelock’s murder was wrong ‘without a doubt’ and said he sympathised with the desire of the officer’s family to find his killers. The 40-year-old officer was stabbed 43 times by a mob as he lay helpless. A 6in knife was embedded in his neck in a failed attempt to decapitate him . But he also suggested the police were responsible for provoking the riots that culminated in his death. ‘I saw it as my right to go and throw stones,’ he said. ‘It was people’s right to go out and be a protester, sat outside the police station, smash a window. It was that climate.’ The Tottenham riot was sparked by the death of 49-year-old resident Cynthia Jarrett during a police raid. She had a heart condition and suffered a cardiac arrest, but Mr Jacobs blamed her death on the police. ‘Miss Jarrett in my eyes had been killed,’ he told Newsnight. ‘The accident that was supposed to have happened, no one was hearing that. ‘If you can imagine, it was these police turning up ... looking for a black youth. ‘A black woman has died as a result – it doesn’t matter if she collapsed, high blood pressure or none of that, police were present and she died. You know what I mean – it was a regular occurrence at the time.’ Mr Jacobs said he empathised with PC Blakelock’s family, but said he felt they should direct their anger towards the ‘system’ and the ‘establishment’. The BBC said it did not pay Mr Jacobs for the interview and notified PC Blakelock’s family that it was taking place. A spokesman added: ‘The acquittal of Nicky Jacobs raised a number of issues about the investigation into the murder of PC Keith Blakelock, and the subsequent prosecution. 'We believe Jacobs has important things to say about these subjects, which are in the public interest for us to report.’","BBC accused of 'crass insensitivity' towards the family of murdered officer .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Jeremy Paxman has launched an astonishing attack on his employer the BBC, saying it is ‘smug’ and he hates much of its output. In typically scathing style, the Newsnight presenter said the severance payoff scandal at the corporation – in which senior executives were handed £60million in ‘golden goodbyes’ – had produced a ‘great smell’. And he added that the BBC’s commercial rivals are right to complain that it ‘distorts the marketplace’ with its vast, publicly funded news operation. Jeremy Paxman claimed the BBC 'distorts the marketplace' due to the size of its publicly funded news operation . Paxman said: ‘[The BBC] is smug. I love the BBC in many ways, but at the same time it has made me loathe aspects of it, and that’s a very odd state of affairs. ‘When I see people being given £1million merely for walking out of the door, when I see £100million being blown on that DMI [digital media initiative] thing, a stupid technical initiative like that, I start wondering: how much longer are we going to test the public’s patience?’ In recent months, several of  Paxman’s colleagues – including John Humphrys and David Dimbleby – have openly criticised the BBC’s management. But until now the 63-year-old has been relatively restrained. The Newsnight presenter condemned the high level of pay-offs received by some senior BBC executives asking 'how much longer are we going to test the public's patience?' BBC Director General standing outside New Broadcasting House which Paxman describes as 'a ghastly building' He hit out at the size of the BBC, saying much of its content, such as its popular music stations, could be produced equally well by commercial broadcasters. He told the Guardian newspaper: ‘There’s a pile of stuff on the BBC I can’t stand. My idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [New Broadcasting House] in a lift which has Radio 1 Extra plumbed into it. I don’t quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1 Extra. I don’t really understand why it does Radio 1. ‘Clearly, you can meet those needs commercially. The BBC has got an unfortunate history of never seeing an area of broadcasting – or, increasingly, a web presence – without feeling the need to get into it itself.’ Paxman said the BBC was 'smug' and he hated much of its output . Paxman questioned the continuing existence of channels such as BBC Radio 1 featuring DJ Nick Grimshaw (right) pictured alongside pop stars Paolo Nutini (left) and Rita Ora (centre) Paxman claimed 'The BBC has got an unfortunate history of never seeing an area of broadcasting - or, increasingly a web presence - without feeling need to get into it itself' And he accused the BBC of using the licence fee to undermine its commercial rivals. There is growing anger over how the corporation is able to challenge the country’s Press through its publicly funded news websites. Home Secretary Theresa May said last year that the BBC was ‘destroying local newspapers’. Paxman said his idea of hell was 'going down in one of the lifts in that hastly new building [New Broadcasting House] in a lift which has Radio 1 Extra plumbed into it' Paxman said it was understandable that rival news organisations such as the Daily Mail dislike the fact the BBC is able to compete on ‘unfair terms’. He added: ‘There’s no argument that the BBC distorts the marketplace in online [news]. And I don’t think that has been really sufficiently grasped at a senior level. ‘It just happened, in the same way as has the proliferation of extra television channels, the proliferation of extra radio channels – and, going further back, the move into local radio. ‘These things just happened because the BBC is institutionally unable to countenance something without wanting to have it for itself.’ Paxman was equally cutting about the recent payoff scandal. He said: ‘I don’t tar [director general] Tony Hall with this because he hasn’t been there long enough, but the great smell that comes off those payoff scandals – and I think they are scandals – is of an organisation which  became complacent, preoccupied with the conditions of its  senior staff, at the expense of a strategic vision.’ Earlier this year, Radio 4 presenter Humphrys said the BBC was ‘grotesquely over managed’ and has a ‘broadly liberal’ bias.  Dimbleby said the BBC was ‘too big for its own good’. Last year, BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen warned its stars to stop attacking the corporation in public. He said: ‘I’m finding a little too often that people who work for the BBC and are well rewarded for it are quick to attack or criticise the organisation.’","Paxman criticised huge rewards for senior staff when they leave the BBC .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . William Shatner, 82, who played Captain James Kirk in Star Trek, claims it is a mathematical certainty there are living creatures on other planets because the universe is so vast . As captain of the USS Enterprise, he had daily contact with extra-terrestrial beings. And Star Trek actor William Shatner has revealed he believes in the existence of aliens in real life too… just not as we know it. The 82-year-old, who played Captain James Kirk in the hit sci-fi series and films, claims it is a mathematical certainty that there are living creatures on other planets because the universe is so vast. He told the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t think there is any doubt there is life in the universe, yes. I don’t think there is any question. 'The mathematics involved – what have they just discovered, 730,000 new planets the other day? - mathematically it has to be. ‘You can see life on this planet, so if you had anything approaching the conditions of water and temperature, the possibilities of life happening are certain.’ One of the best-known catchphrases from Star Trek is Spock’s reply to Kirk on spotting a new alien being: ‘It’s life, Jim, but not as we know it’. In fact, despite being wrongly attributed to the Sixties TV series, the phrase comes from a 1987 song Star Trekkin, sung by The Firm. Mr Shatner said he is just as uncertain about what form alien life will take in real life. He said: ‘Just how it happens we don’t know yet, though I’m sure we’ll know soon. The conditions conducive to life must be prevalent all over. Mr Shatner said he is uncertain about what form alien life will take in real life. Above, as Kirk in the original TV series, surrounded by alien 'tribbles' ‘It isn’t all barren rocks and exploding stars. There’s something going on in the universe, and we can’t be the only ones around, in my opinion.’ He added: ‘I’m a spiritual person [but] I don’t know about some of the religions and their dogma. I don’t have answers to the eternal questions like some people have.’ Humans will have settled on the moon ‘within 50 years’, and will have colonised Mars by 2100, Stephen Hawking believes. The astrophysicist went on to say: ‘Our planet is an old world, threatened with an ever-expanding population and finite resources. 'We must anticipate these threats and have a plan B. ‘If our species is to survive the next 100 years, it is imperative we voyage out into the blackness of space.’ As well as appearing in the original Star Trek television series, Mr Shatner reprised his lead role in seven of the spin-off films. He is currently the voice of a power-crazed paramilitary leader in children’s animation Escape From Planet Earth, which was released in cinemas last week. Mr Shatner insisted he is happy to be typecast in science fiction roles, saying: ‘It is not necessarily that I’m drawn to these films, but I suppose people put me and science fiction together and I don’t like to refuse the compliment.’ The Canadian actor, who has been married four times, said he has a love of speed and flying, just like Captain Kirk, and said his active lifestyle has helped him stay youthful in his eighties. He said: ‘I’m a pilot. I have gone so far as flying sail planes and doing power motoring, which is where you have an engine strapped to your back which weighs about 75 pounds and you run like hell. 'I have flown with the birds. I guess I am a real life Captain Kirk. I embrace flight.’ He added: ‘I am in good shape. I ride a lot of horses. We’re all afraid of falling but if you get so afraid that you tighten up then you’ll fall. 'I haven’t done any surgery. I don’t know the answer to people who ask how I stay looking good. I work out as hard as I can and as often as I can.’ Shatner said: 'The conditions conducive to life must be prevalent all over'.

If you tune in to the opening episode of Britain’s Got Talent tonight, you’ll see a 79-year-old grandmother of seven dance a stunning salsa with a partner just half her age. Think that sounds like the formula for a winner? Well, you’d be right … because the pair have already danced to victory on the Spanish version of the show. The ITV programme has been caught up in a fresh fakery row after it emerged that the star contestant of the new series has simply been recycled from abroad. Scroll down for video . Plenty of practice: Paddy Jones, 69, and partner Nico perform on tonight's episode of Britain's Got Talent . In tonight’s episode, pensioner Paddy Jones can be seen astonishing Simon Cowell and his fellow judges with her audacious routine, spinning around partner Nico Espinosa’s head like a dancer a quarter of her age. But it turns out the pair also wowed TV audiences in 2009, when they took the £9,000 top prize on Spanish show Tu Si Que Vales [You Are Worth It]. Meanwhile, a secret email has revealed Britain’s Got Talent executives scoured the nation’s top talent agencies looking for seasoned professionals to enter this year’s contest – despite it being billed as a chance for amateurs to take the spotlight. Former success: The pair are pictured after dancing to victory on the Spanish version of the show . The email, seen by the Daily Mail, billed the series as a ‘profile raising opportunity’, suggesting some will have entered only to boost ticket or album sales. Many already make a living as singers, lookalike models or tribute acts, meaning their rags to riches tales are unlikely to be quite as genuine as viewers might assume. The email said: ‘I’m scouting singers for the next series of Britain’s Got Talent for SYCO TV. Really looking for fantastic singers with outstanding voices and some personality for this potentially profile raising opportunity. ‘Looking for OUTSTANDING musical theatre singers of all styles, all ages, all shapes and sizes.’ It has also emerged that half of the contestants on tonight’s show come from abroad, leaving critics asking whether the programme has given up on its quest to find the best of British talent. One TV insider told the Daily Mail: ‘This makes a mockery of the talent show format. The whole narrative of Britain’s Got Talent is built around the idea that normal people from all over the country get to show off their hidden talents for the first time. ‘We watch them being whittled down on TV and imagine we could make it too, if only we entered. ‘Instead, it looks as if they are hand-picking the cream of the crop in advance. And many don’t even come from this country.’ Out of 15 acts, tonight’s episode will feature seven foreign entrants, including a German violinist, a Frenchman who drums upside down, a Greek karaoke singer, a Ukrainian dance troupe and a cabaret act from the US. Change of heart: Judge Simon Cowell initially appears unimpressed by the pensioner's routine, and presses his 'no' buzzer just 20 seconds in. But after seeing her acrobatics he apologises, deeming the act 'extraordinary' Surprised: Fellow judges Amanda Holden (left) and Alesha Dixon (right)  also express their astonishment . But it is Paddy Jones – real name Sarah – and her younger Spanish dance partner who make the most impact on the judges. Cowell initially appears unimpressed by the pensioner’s routine, and presses his ‘no’ buzzer 20 seconds into the act. But after seeing her acrobatics he apologises, conceding she has been ‘ballistic’ and ‘extraordinary’. Fellow judges Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams also express their astonishment.

They revealed she was approached and encouraged to enter after producers . spotted her on Tu Si Que Vales, and on the Argentine version of . Strictly Come Dancing in 2010. The retired dental nurse, originally from Stourbridge in the West Midlands, started dancing aged two but took it up again only after her husband David died in 2003, 18 months after they retired to Spain. She joined a dance academy run by Espinosa, and the pair have since launched a successful international career. A Britain’s Got Talent spokesman stressed that although Tu Si Que Vales is seen as the Spanish equivalent of Britain’s Got Talent, it is not officially part of the ‘Got Talent’ franchise and is not owned by Cowell’s company. He added: ‘Anyone can apply for Britain’s Got Talent whether they are professional or amateur, irrespective of their past experience and all contestants are auditioned on merit. None of the judging panel had seen or knew of Paddy before her audition.’","Paddy Jones, 79, and her younger dance partner perform on BGT tonight .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC is ‘grotesquely over managed’ and has always had a ‘broadly liberal’ bias, one of its leading journalists has admitted. John Humphrys said the corporation’s reporting on issues such as immigration and the European Union has not been sufficiently sceptical. But while the Today presenter’s comments merely confirm what many of the BBC’s critics have known for years, his analysis of the reasons for its Left-wing bias is more contentious. The 70-year-old said that BBC staff are more likely to be liberal rather than conservative because they are the ‘best and the brightest’ and tend to be university educated. Critic: John Humphrys saif the BBC was not sceptical enough on some issues . ‘The BBC has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons,’ he told the Radio Times. ‘The sort of people we’ve recruited – the best and the brightest – tended to come from universities and backgrounds where they’re more likely to hold broadly liberal views than conservative.’ On the BBC’s reporting, he said: ‘We weren’t sufficiently sceptical – that’s the most accurate phrase – of the pro-European case. We bought into the European ideal. ‘We weren’t sufficiently sceptical about the pro-immigration argument. We didn’t look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour.’ Humphry's Radio 4 colleague Eddie Mair also criticised the broadcaster in the Radio Times . Humphrys claimed the BBC is no longer so biased towards the EU, saying: ‘I think we’re out of that now. I think we have changed.’ But he broadened his criticisms of his employer by saying it has too many managers and needs to be slimmed down. He said: ‘There are too many of them. I think they think that. I think [director general] Tony Hall thinks that – I don’t know, I haven’t asked him, but I think he thinks that. ‘Over the years we’ve been grotesquely over-managed, there’s no question. They’re now getting a grip on it. A lot have gone. I think more need to go.’ This is not the first time Humphrys has publicly attacked the BBC. In January, he said the corporation is too big and is obsessed by ‘box-ticking’. In the Radio Times interview Humphrys also dismissed reports that he and his fellow Today programme presenter Mishal Husain do not get on. In 2009, it was reported that she felt humiliated by him on an episode of Celebrity Mastermind, which he hosts, when he asked her whether she had her job only because she is good looking. But Humphrys said there is no ill-feeling and the remarks were taken out of context. He said: ‘I was making the point that it helps in the newsreading business – and this isn’t controversial, you only have to switch on the telly – to be young and beautiful and highly trained. She’s a proper journalist.’ Writing in the same edition of Radio Times, Humphrys’ Radio 4 colleague Eddie Mair, who presents PM, also criticised the BBC’s management culture. He wrote: ‘At PM, we tried to start a new project, and to get approval we had to spend three weeks in meetings with different bits of the BBC. We dutifully dealt with all their queries and eventually got the go-ahead. Hooray! ‘Two days after starting the project, another part of the corporation showed up and told us to stop. We were bewildered.’ He added: ‘There is always time for dissing other parts of the corporation and whining about how things used to be better. ‘But I’ve been told to stop all that, it’s unprofessional.’ Last year Lord Hall said the BBC could have responded to accusations of Left-wing bias sooner and needed to include a greater range of opinions on Europe.","Broadcaster says BBC is not 'sceptical' enough about some issues .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . As you sit down in front of your hi-tech television, you may think you are the only one watching. But as you catch up on your favourite shows, your internet-enabled 'smart TV' could be harvesting your personal data or even filming you through a camera, the Ofcom chairman warned yesterday. Dame Colette Bowe, who is stepping down from her post at the media regulator later this month, warned of the risks posed by new televisions that contain cameras and microphones, suggesting companies could use them to spy on customers. The chairman of Ofcom has warned  internet-enabled 'smart TVs' could be harvesting your personal data or even filming you through a camera . She told the Lords' Communications Committee she was concerned about the 'relatively unknown risks and dangers that consumers face'. She continued: 'If you have a smartphone you are carrying a computer around in  your pocket. A smart TV may well have a camera and a microphone in it. It is there in your living room. What is that smart TV doing? Do people realise that?' As head of Ofcom, Dr Bowe is in charge of overseeing the regulation of most of the UK's television industry, as well as its mobile telephone networks and internet providers. She warned the problem of protecting consumers' data was the biggest challenge the sector currently faces, but stopped short of calling for new laws to protect privacy. She said: 'In terms of big challenges coming towards us it is in the area of data, privacy and people's willingness to yield up information about themselves and place themselves in positions of some risk, because of poorly understood uses of this technology. It is a major challenge, though whether it is a legislative challenge I'm not sure.' In November, smart TV manufacturer LG was accused of collecting data about its customers' viewing habits, even after they enabled privacy settings on their sets. Dame Colette Bowe warned of the risks posed by new televisions that contain cameras and microphones, suggesting companies could use them to spy on customers . An IT consultant claimed his set was monitoring the channels he was watching and had uploaded information about the contents of devices he connected to it. The South Korean manufacturer announced an investigation into what it called a 'possible data breach', but insisted: 'Customer privacy is a top priority'. The Information Commissioner's Office also launched an investigation into the  firm for a possible breach of the Data Protection Act. Many new TVs include built-in cameras to allow people to make video calls from their living rooms. But experts have warned it is possible for voyeuristic hackers to access cameras installed in some TV sets remotely, and spy on users in their own homes. On March 31, Dr Bowe will step down from her post after five years to be replaced by former BBC policy director Patricia Hodgson. She used one of her last public appearances to call for changes in the way the BBC is run. Recommending that the corporation appoints a board of non-executive directors, she said its current management structure is a 'mistake' and 'highly regrettable'. And she suggested rival broadcasters such as Channel 4 ought to be allowed to use BBC technology such as iPlayer to distribute  their programmes.","Dame Colette Bowe warned of the .

She has spent most of her comedy career as one-half of the double act French and Saunders. Now Dawn French has announced she venturing out alone with her first solo stand-up tour. The 56-year-old, whose last tour with Jennifer Saunders was panned by critics in 2008, said she will draw on material from her own life and career in the new show, called 30 Million Minutes. It will open in Sheffield on June 5 and tour the country until August 2. However, as no London dates have yet been announced it is expected the tour may be extended if it is successful. Miss French said yesterday she was ‘sick with excitement’ about the tour. She added: ‘I am enjoying the fact that I can’t categorise exactly what it is, but it’s somewhere between a monologue, a play, and an autobiographical slide show with a few funnies thrown in. ‘At last, I have one of my three genie wishes granted, which is that I finally get to work with [director] Michael Grandage. The other two wishes are as yet unfulfilled. ‘They are secret obviously, but suffice to say, one is about Barack Obama in speedos. The other is about me in speedos, with cheesecake involved.’ The Vicar of Dibley star first shot to fame in 1982 when she and Miss Saunders, 55, appeared in The Comic Strip on Channel 4. The pair first met at acting school, where Miss Saunders dismissed her as ‘cocky’ and she thought miss Saunders was ‘snooty and aloof’. They went on to become friends and their hit sitcom French & Saunders ran for six seasons. Six years ago they attempted a comeback with a West End stand up show Still Alive, but critics branded it ‘tired’ and ‘lifeless’.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . The BBC is preparing to axe one of its main TV channels to help it find another £100million in savings, insiders have said. In a dramatic concession to those who accuse the corporation of being too large and unwieldy, director general Tony Hall is expected to jettison BBC3 or BBC4 entirely. Although the plans have been kept secret while he consults with a team of advisers, the BBC will formally announce the cut in the next month. Salami slicing: Tony Hall has said he does not want cuts to happen in dribs and drabs . It would be one of the biggest shake-ups of the corporation in recent years, and is likely to provoke a wave of protest from viewers. Lord Hall has refused to give any details but has hinted strongly that he will make a single dramatic cut rather than trim each department’s budget. Speaking at the Oxford Media Convention this week, he said he was prepared to make a  ‘hard decision’ rather than see  any reduction in the BBC’s drama budget. He said: ‘We decided we’d reached the point where salami-slicing would affect quality and distinctiveness. Rather than seek to preserve a less good version of our past, we decided to focus on what we do best: from drama to taking iPlayer into the next generation.’ Lord Hall said the BBC needs to deliver an additional £100million of savings. It is still only halfway through the £700million programme of cuts – known as Delivering Quality First – which was set up by former director general Mark Thompson. Debate: Jonathan Dimbleby has said high-brow BBC4 should merge with BBC2 because they are similar . It could cut any one of its major services or channels, with the World Service a potential target. But several senior BBC insiders said the axe is most likely to fall on either its youth channel BBC3 or the high-brow BBC4. One source told the Daily Mail: ‘Tony is keeping his cards close to his chest … But we all expect him to cut down the number of TV channels. It doesn’t make any sense having so many platforms, and we can’t keep on cutting other budgets.’ In recent months, a series of senior BBC figures have publicly called for the corporation to be slimmed down. In November last year, veteran presenter Jonathan Dimbleby suggested BBC4 should be merged with BBC2, with the ‘gardening and the cookery’ replaced by quality Arts programmes and documentaries. Former BBC chairman Lord Grade, who  has said the distinction between the channels is ‘very blurred indeed’. Can't get her out of our heads: The BBC is having at least one major success with Kylie Minogue . Last month BBC2 and BBC4 controller Janice Hadlow announced she was stepping down from her role to concentrate on running ‘special projects and seasons’. The stations are yet to find a new controller. Once it announces which channel it will cut, the BBC will have to put the proposal to the BBC Trust, which would then have to put the plans through a lengthy public consultation. The cumbersome process could prove to be a stumbling block for Lord Hall’s plan. In 2010, the BBC was forced into a U-turn after its plan to axe Radio 6 Music backfired. The BBC Trust revoked the decision after a wave of protests from listeners. ÷ The BBC has bought around £2.5million worth of iPhones, iPads and MacBooks for staff in the past two years,. They bought 4,266 iPhones, 427 iPads and 815 MacBooks between January 2012 and October 2013 according to figures released under Freedom of Information. In addition, they are thought to have spent tens of thousands of pounds training staff how to use the gadgets.","Director general Tony Hall said he does not want gradual 'salami slicing'

"By . Lillian Radulova . Little Nupela may only be ten-months-old, but the cheeky Goodfellow's Tree Kangaroo has proved she's full of confidence and ready to take on the world. The adorable joey is the first of her species to be born in Sydney's Taronga Zoo for over 20 years according to her keepers. Although she was born in September last year, the little marsupial only just began to peek out of her mother's pouch in March. Scroll down for video . Nupela, born in September of 2013, is the first tree Kangaroo to be born at Taronga Zoo in Sydney in 20 years . The cheeky joey is currently 10-months-old and at only 2.6 kilograms, is only a quarter of the size of a full grown adult tree kangaroo . Now, the little critter happily bounds around alongside Qwikila, her proud mother, with her adventurous personality delighting the zoo's visitors. 'She started coming out of her mum's pouch probably about 10 weeks ago and she kind of stopped fitting in the pouch about six weeks ago,' Nupela's keeper Sam Bennet said. 'There was about a month where she was going in and out as she built up her muscles so that she could climb tress properly.' Currently, Nupela is only a quarter of the size of a regular adult, weighing 2.6 kilograms and growing rapidly. Nupela's keeper, Sam Bennet, says her personality has flourished since she left her mother's pouch and that she is often spotted playing with her mum . Pictured here at only 38-weeks-old, Nupela will stay by her mother's side until she is about 18 months of age and weighs five kilograms . Her mother, Qwikila (right) arrived from Belfast Zoo in Northern Ireland in January last year before she successfully mated with the zoo's resident male, Parum . Nupela is incredibly enthusiastic during feeding time, according to her keeper, who said she is growing rapidly . 'Shes certainly become a confident little tree kangaroo – we've caught her playing with her mum and chasing her around the yard, which was quite funny to watch,' Mr Bennet said. 'She's also incredibly motivated for food and constantly wants to eat, which explains her growing so quickly.' Her mother, Qwikila, arrived from Belfast Zoo in Northern Ireland in January last year and staff were thrilled when she successfully mated with the zoo's resident male, Parum shortly afterwards. Keepers are now attempting to encourage Parum and their fourth roo, Salsa, to also mate by keeping them in a separate enclosure to the new mum and her baby. Nupela is Taronga Zoo's fourth resident tree kangaroo. The zoo is part of an international breeding program attempting to increase the species' population number . The number of tree Kangaroos in captivity is currently a tiny 50 in captivity and the marsupials are listed as an endangered species . Goodfellow’s Tree Kangaroos are native to Papua New Guinea, where they are endangered. Taronga Zoo is one of many zoos around the world which are part of an international breeding program attempting to increase the species' population number, which has dropped to a tiny 50 in captivity. They are normally a deep brown colour with golden yellow limbs and a long, mottled yellow and brown tail. Living in trees and feeding on leaves and fruit, they are known to hop from branch to branch and can comfortably land on the ground from a 10 metre drop.","Nupela was born at Taronga Zoo in September last year, but has only just begun leaving her mother's pouch .

A former BHP Billiton Limited steel worker has won a landmark court case against the mining giant which was ordered to pay their former employee more than $2.2 million in compensation after exposing him to asbestos dust. Currently bed-bound and suffering from depression, Steven Dunning from Cessnock, New South Wales, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, after being exposed to the fatal substance while working at the blast furnaces at Newcastle Steelworks from the age of 19 in December 1979 until 1981. 'I cannot begin to explain the devastation we felt on the day we were told he had this terminal illness,' Mr Dunning's wife, Roma said.

'We are trying to make the most of every day even though Steven is still very sick and unable to do most of the things he used to enjoy. 'It is a daily struggle knowing that I will not have my loving husband to grow old with and that he will never meet his grandchildren and his life will be cut so short. We never expected this to happen.' The trial heard how the cancer and radiotherapy Mr Dunning received, changed him from a 'happy go lucky, try anything, take this piss out of you' man, to someone plagued with night-sweats, lacking energy and motivation and suffering from a range of physical side-effects including, burns and vomiting. 'When things remind him of the mesothelioma…they trigger uncontrollable shaking,' The court papers state. 'When Mrs Dunning asks him what's going on in his head ""He would say he wants to be here longer, to be with his family, but he is so scared that the meso is going to come back very soon and kill him, at such a young age"".' The 54-year-old was diagnosed with terminal mesothelioma as a result of his exposure between the years 1979-1981, when he worked at the company's Newcastle Steelworks . After a brutal four year court battle in which BHP argued 'every available legal point', the company was ordered to pay the 54-year-old $2,236,959.57 in damages. 'Mr Dunning was only 50 when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma and he has not been able to work since then,' Joanne Wade, a solicitor from Slater and Gordon told Daily Mail Australia. 'He had intended to work until 70-years-old, so part of the judgement includes his loss of earning capacity.' 'It's a landmark decision in New South Wales because the damages awarded are the highest ever awarded in the Dust Diseases Tribunal of NSW and the first time that BHP has been ordered by the tribunal to pay financial compensation to a former employee from Newcastle Steelworks who was exposed to asbestos.' BHP is expected to appeal the decision which Slater and Gordon solicitor, Joanne Wade, called a 'landmark' win . The trial revealed that BHP were aware of the large quantity of asbestos at the steelworks and understood the fatal consequences it presented to its workers - even in small amounts - and yet the material continued to be used right up until 1985. Although BHP has shown signs that they will pursue an appeal - postponing the payment date for at least 28 days - Ms Wade said that the case has set a precedent and is likely to instill confidence in other former employees who were also negligently exposed to asbestos while working at Newcastle Steelworks. 'Once the judgment came down, BHP's lawyers immediately requested a stay on paying the money and indicated they were considering an appeal,' Ms Wade said. 'We do expect more people to come forward because the average latency period for exposure to asbestos and contracting the illness is 40 years, so if they were still using asbestos products into the mid 1980s then we expect more people to come forward with illnesses right up until the 2020s.'","Steven Dunning, 54, is to be payed $2.2 million in damages by BHP Billiton .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Police have issued a public apology to the gay community 20 years after an infamous raid on a nightclub during which people were detained, strip-searched and humiliated for seven hours. Victoria Police issued the apology on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the incident at Tasty nightclub in Melbourne on August 7, 1994, a date dubbed a 'dark day' for the local lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community. The raid involved police storming the venue on Flinders Lane before searching and detaining 463 clubbers for seven hours. Victorian police publicly apologised to the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) community on Tuesday for the illegal drug raid of Tasty Nightclub in 1994 (pictured) Officers told the clubbers to put their hands up, calling them 'f.....s', before strip-searching them for drugs - a procedure which included flashlights being shined up their backsides. Victoria Brown, the bartender at Tasty who was present during the raid, said the event was 'hideous'. Victoria Brown, the bartender at Tasty who was present during the raid, described the 'hideous' details of the event, which included men's backsides being searched with flashlights . 'I was right behind the bar so I could see everything. The police didn't have a clue, they weren't organised at all – they didn't even realise there would be so many women there and they had to send out for more female officers to carry out the searching,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'They made people stand there with their hands on their heads for an extraordinary amount of time - it was torture. 'They went through my bra and my knickers and I said to them 'you can touch my bits but you can't touch my hair!'. 'We didn't know our rights - there was only one boy would talked up and they threw him in the dibby van. They wouldn't even let us go to the toilet, and some of them they wouldn't even let them have water.' The raid was branded 'extreme and disturbing' by the then Victorian premier Jeff Kennet, according to The Age, and Victoria Police were hit with legal action by at least 250 patrons. Ms Brown was one of the many people at the raid who received up to $10,000 in compensation. Gavin Campbell, the former resident DJ and founder of Tasty Nightclub, told Daily Mail Australia that the police apology was so unexpected that it moved him to tears . Tasty Nightclub was famous for its themed parties (pictured) and known as a gay club hotspot : 463 clubbers were illegally stripped searched by police for seven hours on August 7 in 1994 . She attributes the win to two factors - the presence of solicitor Gary Singer at the raid, who was also strip searched and subsequently formed a class action against Victoria Police, as well as the photographic evidence of four men with their arms against the wall which was taken without the police's knowledge. Mr Campbell is has also organised a reunion for the victims of the raid, which is to be held on Saturday August 9 . 'Court was even worse than the night because all the police were sitting there and snickering and jeering and it was the most intimidated I ever felt in my life,' Ms Brown said. 'They just thought ""filthy, dirty, homosexuals - no one will ever believe them"".' Acting chief commissioner Lucinda Nolan from Victoria Police said in a statement on Tuesday: 'The events that took place that night caused distress to people and had a significant impact on the relationship between Victoria Police and the wider LGBTI community.' 'It is therefore appropriate we extend a sincere apology to the community members who were affected by the events on that night and also to the broader LGBTI community for the impact this event has had on our relationship over the past two decades.' Gavin Campbell, the former resident DJ and founder of Tasty Nightclub, told Daily Mail Australia that the police apology was so unexpected that it moved him to tears. 'They've done nothing in 20 years and it was quite brutal to start with - no one realises what the police were actually like on the night of the event -  It wasn't just a drug bust, it was abuse,' Mr Campbell said. 'The public apology was amazing.When police suddenly apologised it had a big impact and an awful lot of people are so shocked because we weren't asking for one and we weren't expecting one.' Mr Campbell is the head organiser behind the reunion for the victims of the raid, which is to be held on Saturday August 9 at Poof Doof, a Melbourne club.","Victorian police appologised for the controversial drug raid of Melbourne's Tasty nightclub in 1994 on Tuesday .

"By . Lillian Radulova . and Aap . Tony Abbott's government continues to languish behind the Labor Opposition, with the latest Newspoll showing the public would turf the government out in a landslide if an election was held today. The Newspoll, published in today's  The Australian, shows that despite a tiny one per cent gain in the Coalition's primary vote in the last fortnight, Tony Abbott's government remains deeply unpopular with the electorate. The government's fortunes took a turn for the worst with the release of the May 13 Budget, which included cuts to welfare spending, schools and hospitals. When elected in September, the Coalition's primary vote was 45.6 per cent, but now it has fallen to just 36 per cent. Labor's primary vote in the September election was just 33.3 per cent, but has now risen under Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to 12.3 per cent. Scroll down for video . Surveys conducted by The Australian have revealed that the Labor party continues to be favoured by Australians two months after the governments budget release . Newspoll figures show that until May 4, voters favoured the elected government by at least 4 per cent. But surveys carried out from May 16 right up until Sunday, show a swing in the opposite direction. In the two-party preferred poll, support for the Liberal party has dropped down to 46 per cent while Labor is favoured by 54 per cent of voters, as of July 13. Newspoll also shows voters continue to prefer BIll Shorten over Tony Abbott as Prime Minister. A survey asking readers to determine the better prime minister out of the two parties leaders, also shows that the majority choose Bill Shorten over Tony Abbott by 5 per cent . The Newspoll findings come as phone polling carried out across the country revealed the unpopularity of the government's higher education cuts, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. The survey found 69 per cent of those surveyed opposed increases in university fees while 65 per cent disagreed with the Abbott Government's 20 per cent public funding cut to university courses. Higher education cuts top the list of policies that voters are most unhappy about, according to the Sydney Morning Herald which found that 69 per cent of those surveyed oppose the increases in university fees . The survey also found 46 per cent were opposed to government funding for privately-owned universities, with only 28 per cent in support. The voter's dislike at the proposed cuts can also be clearly seen in the drop in support for federal Education Minister Christopher Pyne, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Pyne's support has fallen by 13 per cent since last September's election, putting him at risk of losing his seat of Sturt in Adelaide’s eastern suburbs. Meanwhile, the Newspoll also found the majority of voters wanted the carbon tax scrapped. The poll found 53 per cent of voters want the Palmer United Party (PUP) to support the repeal bills, while 35 per cent want the party to vote against them. The latest survey was conducted after the proposal to axe the controversial carbon tax was blocked by PUP senators on Thursday. The federal government has since been in talks with PUP staff to discuss further changes to the bills, ahead of it going back to the lower house on Monday. Mr Abbott has said he is still committed to abolishing the tax. The Newspoll of 1207 voters taken on Friday, Saturday and Sunday also shows 85 per cent of coalition supporters want the carbon tax scrapped immediately, while eight per cent want it to remain and seven per cent are undecided. About 30 per cent of Labor supporters also want the tax's imminent removal, though the majority, 53 per cent, want Palmer United to block the bills.","The latest Newspoll shows support for Tony Abbott at lowest level since 2009 .

"By . Lillian Radulova . With the deafening noise of commercial planes overhead, peeling paint, chipped tiles and a patchy backyard complete with an over-sized antenna, one might ask who would want to live in the run-down home. But the three bedroom home in Mascot in Sydney's south-east, has proven to be just another one of the citys dumps that home-buyers are willing to spend millions on. Only a three minute drive from Sydney's busy and bustling airport, the house is expected to be auctioned off for at least $1,089,000 when it goes under the hammer. A three bedroom home on Middlemiss Street in Sydney's south-east is expected to be sold for at least $1,089,000 despite its poor condition . N G Farah real-estate agent Joe Recep told the Daily Mail Australia that 'it would be a lot easier just to bulldoze it and start again' Since being advertised online only three days ago, N G Farah real-estate agent Joe Recep said the property has received well over 40 inquiries. 'The demographic [of people inquiring] is very wide. There are people looking to invest, people looking to upgrade from units or smaller dwellings who live in the area and developers looking to bulldoze it and put two dwellings in its place,' Mr Recep told the Daily Mail Australia. 'It's all about the location and the price point; you can't get much for under a million in this area.' Mr Recep said that the location of the house, rather than being a detriment in terms of noise, was more likely to attract buyers due to its 'convenient' proximity to the airport, benefiting anyone who works there. Since being put on the market only three days ago, the property has already received at least 40 email inquiries from people showing interest . Built in the 60s, the property is set on a 390 square metre plot of land but the house only takes up about 40 per cent of the available space. 'It's in pretty poor condition. It's pretty much in its original state and it would be a lot easier just to bulldoze it and start again,' Mr Recep said. The agent said that the current owner is a young man who bough the house as an investment property and is now planning to put the sale money into his business. Mr Recep acknowledge the growing trend of home-buyers who take on run-down properties 'as their project', a movement which has been pushed along by 'Sydney's hot property price market'. 'They may seem expensive but they're often really good value. A lot of people like to be their own home renovators and build their dream home to their own taste,' Mr Recep said.

"By . Lillian Radulova . It's hard to imagine 20-year-old Kahli Brock, with her stunning long legs and flawless features, ever being the subject of harassment. But the aspiring model, who is set to represent Queensland as one of 24 finalists in the 2014 Australian Supermodel Of The Year competition, revealed that she feared for her life during her high school years. 'I remember when the swimming carnival was coming up - it was like the third week of high school - the other girls threatened me that if I went I would be drowned,' Kahli told the Daily Mail Australia. Kahli Brock, 20, said the first four years of high school were the worst of her life as she revealed she received death threats and was constantly bullied . 'They kept saying they'd kill me eventually and it stopped me from doing the things I loved.' From day one, the teen from Iluka, endured severe bullying that would last for four years until she eventually decided to leave. 'On my first day of school I had 12 girls harass me. As soon as I got to school, I was double dacked - undies and all- and stabbed in the back of the nexck with a sharpened paperclip. I'll never forget that day,' Kahli said. 'For four years straight, from year seven to year 10, that was worst time of my life.' The once sporty and happy child, stopped doing her favourite activities and began to fear going to school each day. Pictured here in year seven, the aspiring model is now set to represent New South Wales as one of 24 finalists in the 2014 Australian Supermodel Of The Year competition . When recalling some of her most traumatic events, the current Curtain University student remembered being trapped in the girls bathroom after being chased by another student who was trying to brand her with a 'smiley' - the shape of the burn mark left on a person's skin after being branded with a hot lighter. 'I was tall - that was one of the reason I was being bullied, and also because I had gap between my teeth,' she said. Kahli then left Maclean High School to attend Grafton High, a trip which took four hours of public transport each way, before returning to Maclean at the end of year 12 to complete her High School Certificate. By the time she had returned, she had  straightened her teeth with braces and had already begun modeling, competing in Miss Country Girl Australia in 2010 and being placed in the top eight. She found attitudes towards her had changed, with one student even writing her a letter of apology for previously harassing her. The university student who is studying to be a primary school teacher and volunteers at the rural fire fighting brigade, hopes to reach new heights in her modeling career . 'As soon as I did modeling they started being nice and wanting to get to know me – I forgive them but I don't forget,' Kahli said. Now, the university student who is studying to be a primary school teacher and volunteers at the rural fire fighting brigade, hopes to reach new heights in her modeling career.

IVF patients could save thousands of dollars after a new health clinic agreed to cut out-of-pocket expenses by bulk-billing the majority of services involved with the fertility treatment. The bulk-bill clinic, which has already had 300 inquiries, will cut prices for IVF treatment to an estimated $500, compared to roughly $4,000 in private health clinics. Primary Health Care, an Australian medical health centre provider, will open the IVF clinic in Sydney's CBD on Monday. A new health clinic in Sydney has agreed to cut out-of-pocket expenses for IVF patients by bulk-billing the majority of services involved with the fertility treatment . Average costs for IVF treatment are about $8,000 with Medicare - Australia's public health care scheme - covering between $3,000 to $4,000, the Daily Telegraph reports. IVF patients at the clinic would still have to cover those services not included in Medicare bulk-billing, like day surgery and embryo freezing. The clinic's provider is big enough to absorb the extra costs and offer bulk-billing for IVF treatments, according to its chief executive Dr Edmund Bateman. The bulk-bill clinic, which has already had 300 inquiries, will cut prices for IVF treatment to an estimated $500, compared to roughly $4,000 in private health clinics . 'If the medical procedure has an (medicare) item number we will bulk-bill it and you pay nothing for it,' Dr Bateman told the newspaper.

"By . Jill Reilly . A 30-year-old has admitted he was killed his girlfriend's unborn child by crushing an abortion-causing medication over a pancake she ate. Scott Bollig, 30, of WaKeeney will be arraigned September 9 after prosecutors provided ample evidence during a two-day preliminary hearing to have him bound over for trial. He is accused of causing Naomi Abbott to lose her fetus on January 31 by lacing her food with the drug, The Salina Journal reported. Scott Robert Bollig, from Wakeeney, Kansas, allegedly crushed up the drug on January 26 before giving it to his girlfriend, 36-year-old Naomi Abbott, who was between eight and ten weeks pregnant . Trego County District Judge Glenn Braun said a hearing will be scheduled on a motion to suppress statements Bollig made to law enforcement. The motion alleges the statements were made before he was properly advised of his rights. During Bollig's preliminary hearing, prosecutor Jessica Domme, an assistant Kansas attorney general, said medical evidence showed that the drug Abbot ingested, mifepristone, caused bodily harm with lasting effects like nausea and pain. On Thursday, WaKeeney Police Chief Terry Eberle testified that Bollig admitted to lacing a pancake he served to Abbott without her knowledge on January 26 or 27, and that she ate three-fourths of it. Home: Bollig lives in Trego County, Kansas (pictured), where the alleged crime occurred . Bollig told investigators he purchased five pills for $60 over the Internet on January 14 and picked them up January 22 at the post office, Eberle said, adding that Bollig said he threw the other four pills away after Abbott lost the 8- to 10-week-old fetus. Other recent cases have involved Misoprostol, also known by its commercial name, Cytotec. Misoprostol was initially FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers, but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early-term pregnancies. It is about 88 per cent effective up to eight weeks gestation, and is believed to be a cheaper and less invasive alternative to surgical abortion, if taken early enough. An investigation began almost immediately after the fetus' death, Eberle said, because an officer had informed him that Abbott - a Trego County jailer - had expressed concerns to another officer that her boyfriend might be putting something in her food to terminate her pregnancy. On Friday, Hays pathologist Dr. Lyle Noordhoek, who performed an autopsy on the fetus, said a sample of blood serum taken from Abbott had tested positive for mifepristone, which should be administered under a doctor's supervision because of the risks associated with its ingestion. Noordhoek said he had reviewed a copy of instructions he was told came with the pill that Abbott consumed, and that they appeared to have been written by someone for whom English is a second language and did not meet Food and Drug Administration requirements. During the hearing's two days, Bollig's attorney, Daniel Walter, questioned investigators about the tactics they used when interrogating Bollig, including whether they had properly read him his rights or coerced him to make incriminating statements. He also questioned why no audio or video recordings were made of a February 20 interview conducted by Eberle and Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Kevin Campbell that concluded with Bollig's arrest. 'I guess I'm from the old school,' Campbell said. 'If there's two cops in a room interviewing a person, you don't need a recording.'","Scott Bollig, 30, admitted putting the pill in his girlfriend's food .

"By . Jill Reilly . A multi-millionaire who believes California should be separated into six separate states says he has gathered enough signatures to place it on the ballot in two years. Venture capitalist Tim Draper, 55, says the Golden State is too large to govern efficiently, and that people living there would be better served by a more localised government. The technology investor has proposed splitting the state into six: San Diego and Orange County would become South California, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara would make up West California, the Sacramento area would be known as North California, and Bakersfield, Fresno and Stockton would make up Central California. Scroll down for video . Proposals: Venture capitalist Tim Draper, 55, believes California should be separated into six separate states to enable the region to be governed more effectively . Scheme: Mr Draper wants to separate California into six states . Mr Draper, a founder of a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that has invested in Twitter, Skype and Tesla, among other companies, has been agitating for months for a ballot initiative to chop the most populous U.S. state into smaller entities. 'It’s important because it will help us create a more responsive, more innovative and more local government, and that ultimately will end up being better for all of Californians,' said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the campaign. 'The idea ... is to create six states with responsive local governments - states that are more representative and accountable to their constituents. 'Salazar said Monday that the campaign had gathered more than the roughly 808,000 signatures needed to place the measure on the November, 2016 ballot. Draper and other supporters plan to file the signatures with California Secretary of State Debra Bowen on Tuesday. But the plan has raised bipartisan hackles across the state, and opponents say it stands little chance of gaining voter approval. If California did vote for the change, it would then be up to the US Congress to authorise the new states' inclusion into the union which opponents say is also unlikely. Should California be split into six separate states? 'This is a colossal and divisive waste of time, energy, and money that will hurt the California brand,' said Steven Maviglio, a Democratic political strategist who has formed the group OneCalifornia with GOP strategist Joe Rodota to fight Draper’s plan. 'It has zero chance of passage. But what it does is scare investment away... at a time when the Governor is leading us to an economic comeback. Campaign: Mr Draper, who made his name investing in companies such as Hotmail and Skype has set up a website to promote his scheme . The six carved out states would look like this: . Jefferson: The northern part of the state, including Humboldt and Mendocino counties. North California: The wine country counties of Sonoma and Napa, as well as the Sierra Nevada region. Silicon Valley: Including San Francisco, San Jose and most of what's considered the San Francisco Bay Area. Central California: The vast central valley farm region, including Tulare and Fresno counties. West California: Including Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. South California: Including what's called the Inland Empire of San Bernadino and Riverside, plus San Diego. 'Draper's plan would split the world’s eighth-largest economy along geographic lines. One state, to be called Silicon Valley, would include the tech hub along with the San Francisco Bay Area. Jefferson, named after the third U.S. president, would encompass the northernmost region. The state capital of Sacramento would be in North California, while South California would be made up of San Diego and the eastern suburbs of Los Angeles.L.A. itself would be part of a state called West California. Were his plan to be implemented Mr Draper, who made his name, and some of his fortune, investing in Skype and Hotmail, would find himself living in the Silicon Valley state as he lives in Atherton - located between San Francisco and San Jose, and ranked number two on Forbes magazine's most expensive zip codes. Proponents say the division would help create a more business-friendly environment, solve the state’s water issues, and ease traffic congestion. More than 38 million people call California home, making it the most populous state in the US, and if it was to be its own country it would boast the world's eighth largest economy. California is also the third largest state by area, taking in almost 164,000 square miles of coastline, mountain ranges, several huge cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego, and desert. Urban: The state is home to several huge cities, including Los Angeles which has a population of 3.85million . Diverse: California covers almost 164,000 square miles - from densely populated cities to the desert, such as Death Valley .","Timothy Draper says he has enough signatures to place it on the ballot .

John Sharp, 31, was found floating dead in the water off the resort of Playa d'en Bossa near Bora Bora nightclub on Saturday morning. Police spent days trying to identify him after he was pulled out of the sea in a pair of swimming trunks with no ID on him. Party island: Tourists leave the Bora-Bora Bar at the Playa d'en Bossa close to where British tourist John Sharp, 31, was found floating dead in the sea after taking cocaine, ecstasy and speed, drinking heavily . A post-mortem examination revealed he had taken several drugs including cocaine, ecstasy and speed. Clubbers who partied with Mr Sharp before he was found dead have told investigators he was also drinking heavily. A source close to the probe, being led by an investigating magistrate, said: 'We believe he had been dead around 24 hours when he was found floating in the sea. 'He went out partying last Thursday night and was last seen alive by witnesses police have spoken to around 8am the day before he was found dead.' Mr Sharp's parents flew to the island to identify him after being contacted by the Foreign Office. It is not known where in Britain he is from. Good times: People dance in Bora Bora. Clubbers who partied with Mr Sharp before he was found dead have told investigators he was also drinking heavily. It is not known which nightclub he had been visiting . Ibiza's drugs scene has been under the spotlight since the arrests in Peru earlier this month of suspected drugs mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum. They were working in Ibiza over the summer when they claim they were kidnapped by Colombian gunmen and forced to fly to Lima to bring back nearly 12kg of cocaine hidden in their suitcases. They are currently awaiting trial in a Lima jail after being charged with drugs trafficking. Spanish police say they have not ruled out arrests in Ibiza in connection with the failed drugs smuggling operation. Eleven members of a Brit-led drugs trafficking gang arrested in Ibiza in 2009 were sentenced to a total of 32 years in jail in Spain in June after striking a last-minute deal with prosecutors.

And if his caretakers are late, Arturo growls to draw their attention . He added at the time that the bear was in ‘good condition’, explaining that the life expectancy of one of the animals is just over 20 years - but in captivity, they can often live to see the age of 30. Mr Pronotto said: ‘We must avoid a big mistake, like his death during the trip or upon arrival. One must evaluate the risks carefully. He is old, and this would require many hours of anaesthesia.’ Greenpeace had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer Arturo urgently to Canada, which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat. Argentinian professor Fernanda Arentsen, who teaches at Université de Saint-Boniface in Winnipeg, has written to her government and the Canadian Embassy in Buenos Aires over the issue. She told the Winnipeg Free Press last year: ‘You can see he is going crazy. He moves the way polar bears do when they are suffering a lot of stress. Sad case: Arturo - Spanish for Arthur - has been at the zoo for two decades, and has had no contact with his own kind since Pelusa died. Now, campaigners are worried that he is suffering mental health issues . Campaign: US singer Cher, 68, said on Twitter: 'Don't cry for him, Argentina? No tears of Mrs Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner for tortured polar bear Arturo. Your hands are stained with his blood when he dies' ‘He has been filmed rocking back and forth in a way that signals distress. It breaks my heart to see it. I’m from Mendoza. I know how hot summer is. There is no way for him to escape the heat. ‘He looks so sad. He looks in pain. You can imagine a polar bear in the desert with a swimming pool 50cm deep. It’s difficult to watch this poor animal suffering and in pain.’ Arturo, a 900lb (400kg) bear born in the US in 1985, arrived in 1993 in Mendoza, a city of 120,000 at the foot of the Andes, known for its wine production. At Mendoza Zoo, Arturo is served 33lbs (15kg) of meat per day, and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat. He also loves honey. And if his caretakers are late, Arturo growls to draw their attention. As the zoo’s mascot, he has an air-conditioned 375 sq ft (35 sq metre) enclosure, a 5,400 sq ft (500 sq metre) beach and a swimming pool in which his guards throw blocks of ice to keep it cool. A spokesman for Mendoza Zoo did not immediately respond to a MailOnline request for comment. UPDATE: JULY 22, 2014 . Nine days after the story was published, the Embassy of Argentina in London has issued the following statement to MailOnline on behalf of the Government of Mendoza. It said: ‘Arturo the bear, which has recently received international media coverage, was born in captivity in San Diego Zoo, in the United States, and belongs to the fifth generation of a polar bear family born in captivity. Arturo arrived to Mendoza in 1993, as a companion for Pelusa, a polar bear already living at Mendoza zoo which later became its partner. They lived together for 19 years until Pelusa died recently in old age. ‘Even though Arturo is already 39, and has significantly exceeded the maximum normal life expectancy of a bear, he is in a good state of health. He has a good appetite, can move around well and displays normal behaviour. ‘A few months ago, local and international environmental and ecological organisations focused their attention on the condition of this bear living in Mendoza Zoo. This encouraged the provincial government to convene a specialised medical committee back in February in Mendoza. ‘One of the issues evaluated by this committee was the possibility of transferring the animal to Canada, as one of the NGOs had requested. The medical team that gathered in Mendoza advised against moving Arturo. The group, comprising veterinarians and specialists from Argentina, Uruguay and Canada (the latter via videoconference), determined at the time that the animal was in optimum conditions both physically and in terms of its behaviour, that the premises where it lives complies with all international standards and that, given its age, an imminent transfer would put his health at risk. ‘From the outset, the Government of Mendoza has made clear that it would be willing to move the bear should it be necessary, as long as it would not affect its health. But the NGO Assiniboine Park (based in Canada) informed the Government of Mendoza that Canada´s phytosanitary controls discourage any possible importation of polar bears into that country. It is also important to keep in mind that the northern hemisphere has native diseases that are not found in the south and that, in order to perform the necessary tests on the bear for the journey, they would have to sedate the animal, which would endanger its life. ‘Furthermore, by late March, UFIMA (National Public Prosecution Body for Environmental Investigations) determined, following special tests carried out over several months, that Arturo the bear is in good health and had suffered no mistreatment whatsoever at the Mendoza Zoo. ‘With regard to Arturo’s enclosure, the medical committee of veterinary surgeons that convened in February stated that it meets international standards the guidelines of the US Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The committee had requested some improvements to the bear’s living space to give Arturo a better quality of life. Following these suggestions, works were carried out on the site that were completed in April. These included installing improved cooling in its habitat, as well as providing better quality water for the basin. Once the bear adapts to these changes, the enclosure will be enlarged by an additional 12 square metres. ‘The improvements included the installation of three pieces of equipment: a cooling device, equipment for heat extraction from the cave, and a thermostat to regulate the temperature inside the den. This enables the temperature of Arturo´s cave to be adjusted between 5C and 22C, reducing the sudden temperature changes when the bear goes outside. ‘The Government of Mendoza has reaffirmed its intention to respect national and international standards in animal care and preservation. Arturo the bear shall stay in Mendoza on account of the firm decision taken by the medical committee and also because the investigations carried out have shown that the animal has suffered no mistreatment of any kind. On the contrary, it is in a good health and its habitat complies with international guidelines.’","Arturo sits in concrete enclosure at Mendoza Zoo in sweltering heat .

"By . Gerard Couzens . David Cameron has been labeled stupid by Argentina's ambassador to Britain in an astonishing attack over the Falklands. Alicia Castro rounded on the Prime Minister during a speech to the Argentine senate, calling him stupid and dumb . She accused him of being 'inefficient' for criticising Pope Francis' stance on the disputed Falkland Islands. Alicia Castro (left, pictured with former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, centre ) Argentina's ambassador to Britain has called David Cameron stupid in an astonishing attack over the Falklands . Her amazing outburst is set to inflame the already strained relationship between Britain and Argentina and lead to reprisals from Downing Street. The former air hostess, an admirer of Hugo Chavez, ambushed William Hague over the Falklands in May last year by asking him at a public meeting whether he was ready to 'give peace a chance' by opening talks on the islands' future. Her stinging attack on Cameron came at a meeting of the Argentine senate's Foreign Affairs commission. Using the Spanish word Malvinas for the Falklands, she said: 'Cameron was so stupid and inefficient when Pope Francis was chosen as the new papal leader because he broadcast what he had been saying about the Malvinas.' Asking if it was appropriate to describe someone as ""stupid"" in Parliament, she went on to dub Cameron 'foolish'. She added: 'We had the extraordinary luck to be blessed with an Argentine pope who is a Falklander.' Her stinging attack on Cameron came at a meeting of the Argentine senate's Foreign Affairs commission . Cameron criticised the new Pope's stance on the Falkland islands in March by saying he 'disrespectfully' disagreed with comments he made last year when he was cardinal in Buenos Aires that Britain had 'usurped' the islands from Argentina . Appearing to ignore the fact Argentina tried to take the Falklands by force in 1982 by invading the disputed territory and sparking a war with Britain, she added. 'Argentina does not represent a military threat to the United Kingdom or the inhabitants of the islands. 'What does constitute a military threat is the enormous military might of the United Kingdom in the south Atlantic.' David Cameron criticised the new Pope's stance on the Falkland islands in March by saying he 'disrespectfully' disagreed with comments he made last year when he was cardinal in Buenos Aires that Britain had 'usurped' the islands from Argentina. The PM also joked about the signal from Rome's Sistine Chapel signalling a new Pope after an overwhelming vote in a March referendum by islanders to remain British, saying: 'The white smoke over the Falklands was pretty clear.' Alicia Castro said at the time: 'It is striking that the prime minister should dare to rebuff the Pope.' The diplomat also made headlines by refusing an invite to attend Margaret Thatcher's funeral. In 2010, when she was Argentine ambassador in Venezuela, an ex-worker accused of her of bullying her and stealing cash. Castro rejected the claims in a letter published in Argentine daily Clarin. After the death in March of Hugo Chavez, who once claimed Halloween was terrorism implanted by the US in Venezuela, she said: 'He made us all see a better world is possible.'","Alicia Castro rounded on the PM during a speech to Argentine senate .

She giggled at Lauer's feigned protests, adding: 'Sorry.' The pair chatted over a cup of tea at an outdoor table in a sunny London garden. Miss Middleton, looking tanned in a low-cut white shirt with jeans and tasteful gold jewellery, said very little during the minute-long clip except to add: 'I was on my bike.'

"They claim they were kidnapped and held at gunpoint by gangsters . By . Gerard Couzens . and Rebecca Evans . and Steve Robson . A gang led by Phil Collins’s nephew recruited the two young women held in Peru on suspicion of drug smuggling, it was reported last night. Melissa Reid, 19, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country. The British women claim they were kidnapped at gunpoint by gangsters in Ibiza, who forced them to fly to Peru and act as drug mules. Scroll down for video . A gang led by Phil Collins's nephew - Philip Austin Collins - recruited the two young women held in Peru on suspicion of drug smuggling, it has been reported . Drug officers suspect they were recruited by a cartel allegedly operated from behind bars by Philip Austin Collins, son of the Genesis frontman’s brother Clive Collins. On route: Respected human rights lawyer Peter Madden is on his way to Peru to represent Ms Connolly . The 38-year-old was arrested in Peru . last year after £3million worth of cocaine was found on a yacht he and . two other British men were trying to sail across the Atlantic. A solicitor representing Ms Connolly flew out today for a preliminary court hearing. Peter Madden from Belfast has told colleagues he expects to spend at least a week in Lima where Ms Connolly and Ms Reid are being held. He has said that his client will plead not guilty if charged. Mr Madden is one of Northern Ireland's best-known lawyers and has been involved in a number of high profile cases. A former colleague of murdered human rights solicitor Pat Finucane who was shot dead by loyalists in north Belfast in 1989, he was involved in the legal representation of three Irish republicans who were arrested in 2001 in Colombia for allegedly training members of FARC. They eventually returned to Ireland in 2005. Mr Madden said: 'She is saying she has done nothing wrong, that she is innocent and that as far as any offences are concerned, if she is charged she will be denying it. 'It could be a long time. It is a question of considering what the state prosecutor is proposing to do.' He will discuss with local lawyers whether bail would be granted if she is charged. The experienced solicitor has already spoken to the woman and said she was doing as well as could be expected. Melissa Reid, 19, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country . 'If she is charged, there will be a trial so it could take a while,' he said outside George Best Belfast City Airport. Miss McCollum Connolly and Ms Reid have spoken of their concerns that they 'are not going home soon'. Family members of the two women are also said to be travelling to Lima. One of the teenagers has allegedly . told police that she collected the drug haul from outside a takeaway. Miss . Reid said she was called and told to go with her alleged . accomplice Miss McCollum Connolly to collect suitcases packed . with the Class A drug in the country's capital of Lima. Yesterday . it emerged that the women’s first formal police interview had been . postponed because police did not have a translator. It is now expected to take place today or tomorrow. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, . the women claimed to have been forced into carrying the drugs by . members of a violent drug gang who put loaded guns to their heads. Ms Reid said the men had information on their families, who would be threatened if they failed to follow the gang's orders. She . also revealed that the first time the women met was after being . kidnapped and taken to the drug cartel's safe house in Majorca. Ms Reid was the first to be sent to Lima, on August 1. She was joined by photography student and former nightclub hostess Ms McCollum Connolly a day later. Coerced: Melissa Reid, left, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, right, say they were forced into carrying drugs by a violent gang who threatened their families . She . said they were 'coached' on what to say if they were stopped and told . to claim they were 'best friends' who were travelling together. The maximum sentence the pair could receive if convicted is 25 years in jail, but Peruvian police chief Tito Perez said they could be released within two years if they sign a confession. He said that the pair are likely to be charged on Monday or Tuesday of next week. Colonel Perez said: ‘The normal jail sentence for a drugs mule who isn’t found guilty of belonging to a criminal gang is eight years. ‘But if they confess they get six. Convicts sentenced to six years are being released from prison after two years with good behaviour.’ The allegations concerning Collins were reported in one of Peru’s most respected newspapers, El Comercio. Coping: The girls were filmed smiling and eating cake days after they were arrested for alleged drug-smuggling . Locked up: The girls have been held in a prison in Peru for more than a week now . A police source told the newspaper: ‘Officers have confirmed the link between the arrested women and the mafia allegedly led by Philip Austin Collins whose organisation tends to use drug mules from the UK. ‘Although Collins is being held in jail awaiting trial, the drugs trafficking organisation he allegedly created in our capital is still active. The failed attempt to smuggle cocaine through these two women is said to be proof of this.’ A spokesman for Phil Collins said: 'This has nothing to do with my client so there is no comment to be made' Miss Reid, an aspiring nurse, and Miss McCollum Connolly, a photography student, said they were given 11kg of cocaine in a secret meeting with an unknown man outside the Hotel Colonial San Agustin in Lima the day before they were due to fly back to Spain. They have visited the hotel with police, who are trying to obtain CCTV footage of the handover and track down who made the booking. In an interview from inside police headquarters, Miss Reid, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, said: ‘I was the one who went to pick up the drugs outside our hotel. ‘At that point I didn’t know what was in the suitcase, drugs, guns or money and we were like, “we’re not going to do it”. But they said: “We’ve been watching you and you’ve got to do it.”’ Miss McCollum Connolly, who had been reported missing by her family in Northern Ireland before they learned of her arrest, continued: ‘I didn’t realise drugs were so big here but it happens all the time. 'The police have said they see girls like us all the time. We’ve resigned ourselves to the fact that we’re not going home soon and are doing jail time here.’ She added: ‘We’ll take responsibility for what was found on us but we didn’t do it of our free will, we didn’t have a choice.’ Miss Reid’s father, 53-year-old William, was yesterday on his way to visit his daughter, and was hoping to arrive in time for her 20th birthday tomorrow. Mr Reid will be carrying a letter from his wife, Debra, in which she urges her daughter to ‘stay calm’ and adds: ‘I can’t begin to tell you how much we love and miss you, and we pray that you stay safe and that one day you will return safely to your home here with us.’ A spokesman for Phil Collins said: ‘This has nothing to do with my client so there is no comment to be made.’ Party lifestyle: Thousands of young Britons head to Ibiza every summer to work in bars and enjoy the clubbing scene. Pictured, Ms Connolly who is believed to have worked as a tout and on a cruise ship . Like many young Britons, Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly had arrived in the party island of Ibiza for a summer of hedonism in the sun. Ms Connolly says she had found occasional work as a tout, standing outside bars on the West End of the island's San Antonio resort, trying to entice customers inside. Ms Reid was simply enjoying a holiday. But something went drastically wrong. The pair allege that they were kidnapped by a gangsters and forced at gunpoint to travel to Peru to act as drug mules. A 23-year-old woman, who knew Miss Reid, told The Times newspaper: 'She seemed just like the rest of us - clubbing, getting a bit drunk. That she might have been involved in anything like this is incredible.' A friend of Ms Connolly told The Sun that she had been hired to work as a dancer by an exclusive to work on a cruise ship which toured the island. But back in San Antonio, a bar owner who allegedly employed Ms Connolly told a different story. A man, who gave his name as Andreas, told the newspaper he sacked her from working as a barmaid after only one night because she drank more than she sold. 'For every shot she sold she drank two. By the end of the night she was drunk. “I told her ‘f*** off!’ She was no good,' he said. Spanish police have dismissed the girls' story that they were recruited by a cartel to act as mules insisting that it was more likely they were acting for financial reward. But another Scot has told the Daily Record that he found himself in a similar situation with a drugs gang in Ibiza. The man, who did not reveal his identity, said he was almost forced to make a drugs run to Peru after getting into spiralling debts with dealers. He told the newspaper that it is easy for young people to get into trouble because of the hard-partying lifestyle and expensive rent costs. He said he started selling off small amounts of ecstasy and cocaine but the money quickly got out of his control. The 27-year-old, who said he eventually escaped via Madrid airport, added: 'What happened to Melissa could have been me and my friend standing there. 'I feel so sorry for the girls because I know what they’ve been through.'","Philip Austin Collins was found with £3m worth of cocaine last year .

Sam, who was selected by the St Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL draft, received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the annual sports ceremony hosted by ESPN on Wednesday in Los Angeles. The football star, who had earlier walked the red carpet hand-in-hand with his boyfriend Vito Cammisano, told the audience he feels it rests on his shoulders to stand up for those 'who want nothing more than to be themselves openly'. Scroll down for video . Emotional moment: The first openly gay NFL player Michael Sam accepts the Arthur Ashe Courage Award onstage during the 2014 ESPYS at the Nokia Theatre in LA on Wednesday night . Michael Sam, winner of the 2014 Arthur Ashe Courage Award, arrives with boyfriend Vito Cammisano to the ESPY Awards on Wednesday . He said: 'To anyone out there, especially young people, that feel like they don't fit in and would never be accepted, please know this - great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself.' Sam also spoke about how he had helped a friend's sister after she contemplated suicide rather than tell her family she was gay. He broke down as he said: 'She told me that that my example had helped her.' The athlete, who is from Hitchcock, Texas, thanked the coaches who supported him throughout his career along with his mother who raised him with seven brothers and sisters by herself. Two of Sam's siblings have died and one disappeared and has not been found. The football player saved his final word of thanks for boyfriend Vito, saying: 'He is my inspiration.' Sam, a 2013 University of Missouri graduate, has been publicly out since 2011. NFL player Richard Sherman poses with Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel after winning the award for Best Breakthrough Athlete at The 2014 ESPYS . ESPN gave Sam the honor for 'his courage and honesty that resonates beyond sports'. Sam joins a prestigious list of winners ranging from Jim Valvano, the first recipient in 1995, to Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Cathy Freeman, Nelson Mandela and Pat Summitt. The award is named for Ashe, the inspirational tennis star who died in 1993 after contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. After learning he had the disease, Ashe campaigned to raise awareness about AIDS. 'Arthur always believed in and practiced leading by example,' said Ashe's widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe earlier this year. 'When Michael Sam announced that he is gay, he courageously stepped forward to engage an issue that still remains a pervasive problem in many professional sports. Michael has displayed true leadership both on and off the field.' Maura Mandt, executive producer of the ESPYs, called Sam a 'humble guy who isn't looking for any accolades'. 'In deciding to give Michael this honor, while his courageous act of coming out is a part of it, the story is about the life he led growing up,' Mandt added. 'A man who has consistently lived his life with integrity, is never afraid of living this truth.' Other notable winners at the awards show included Richard Sherman, of the Super Bowl champions the Seattle Seahawks, who received a gong for Best Breakthrough Athlete.

"By . Gerard Couzens . Spain is considering a new pact with Argentina over the Falklands as tension with Britain over Gibraltar escalates. Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo will travel to Buenos Aires next month to discuss a joint diplomatic offensive over the disputed territories. Spain has blown hot and cold over supporting Argentina's long-standing claim to the Falklands. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Garcia-Margallo (left) will meet Argentine counterpart Hector Timerman (right) for talks on whether to sign a pact over the disputed territories . Tensions between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar have increased in recent days . Jesus Gracia, its secretary of state for Ibero-America, insisted last year during a visit to Argentina that Spain backed its claim. But Spain described a dispute between Britain and Argentina over oil exploration off the Falklands as a 'bilateral issue' when tempers flared two years ago. Spain's relationship with Argentina took a battering when its president Cristina Kirchner nationalised oil company YPF, a subsidiary of Spanish firm Repsol, in April last year. Respected Spanish daily El Pais said Garcia-Margallo would discuss an alliance in the United Nations over Gibraltar and the Falklands with Argentine counterpart Hector Timerman at a meeting in Buenos Aires early next month. No-one from the Spanish government was available for comment on the reports today. Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner will use UN presidency to highlight Falklands dispute with Britain . Cristina Kirchner wants Britain to agree to negotiations over the Falklands (pictured) Argentina, which started the Falklands War by invading the islands in April 1982, holds the UN Security Council's rotating presidency this month. Cristina Kirchner seized the opportunity to renew her country's demand for talks on the sovereignty of the British-ruled Falkland islands on Tuesday at a a high-level meeting. The Argentine president said: 'This is not a fanciful stance. We simply want the United Nations resolution to be enforced and for our two countries to sit down and discuss this.' Tension between Spain and Britain over the Rock has risen in recent days after Gibraltar dumped 70 concrete blocks into the sea to create an artificial reef and stop Spanish fishermen invading their waters. David Cameron has had emergency talks with Spain PM Mariano Rajoy over Gibraltar tensions . Garcia-Margallo threatened to charge motorists £43 a time to cross the border in a newspaper interview in which he declared: 'The party is over.' Gibraltar's First Minister Fabian Picardo responded by accusing Spain of acting like international pariah North Korea. Downing Street said Spain had agreed to reduce border queues provoked by Civil Guards after an emergency telephone call between David Cameron and Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy. But the queues have continued with waits of up to three hours yesterday/on Saturday for motorists trying to cross into Spain.","Spanish foreign minister to travel for talks on disputed territories .

"By . Louise Boyle . A former Miss Delaware, who was stripped of her crown for being too old, revealed today that she is not giving up the fight to compete in the national Miss America contest. Amanda Longacre, 24, told Today on Monday that she has been nothing but honest with the pageant organizers and that she was willing to sue over the decision to pass her crown to runner-up Brittany Lewis. She said: 'I won the title of Miss Delaware, I am . Miss Delaware. I have been nothing but honest from the beginning. I did . not know that rule. I asked from the beginning if I was eligible and . they said yes, they signed off on my contract, they had my birth . certificate, I gave them everything.' Scroll down for video . Miss Congeniality: Amanda Longacre, 24, (pictured today) who was stripped of her Miss Delaware crown for being too old, is not giving up the fight to compete in the national Miss America contest . Miss Longacre turns 25 in October and the rules state that beauty queens must be between 17 and 24 throughout 2014 to compete in the September Miss America pageant. After less than two weeks as Miss Delaware, the beauty queen was forced to hand back her crown when the age discrepancy was discovered by the national competition. The 24-year-old wept on camera last week as she described the heartache of losing her coveted title. However she is allowed to keep a $9,000 scholarship award which was part of her winnings. Runner-up Miss Lewis will also receive the $9,000 scholarship. For Miss Longacre, however, the fight is all about a title which she believes is rightfully hers. She appeared on the Today show with her attorney who said they were willing to sue the competition organizers over the matter. The Penn State graduate said on Monday: 'I've gotten a lot of support and I'm so appreciative of it. I feel so much love from my state, and even from outside of my state people have been supporting me. 'I've been nothing but honest since the beginning and they don't think it's right either.' She added: 'This is about the title of Miss Delaware that I rightfully won. I want to represent the people of Delaware. I want to be a social worker. This was a great start to a fabulous career for me and it's still going to be a fabulous career for me.' The 24-year-old Penn State graduate wept when she was crowned Miss Delaware earlier this month. The title has now been handed to someone else . She said that although the age rule is in her contract, she assumed she was eligible because the Miss Delaware organization signed off. 'I didn't know the rule, I also competed at the local level and it's been several months. You put your trust in an organization to know their own rules. So when you come forward and you're honest and you put the time and money in, this is not fair.' Miss Longacre said that she planned to fight all the way to compete in Miss America. Miss Longacre, from Bear, Delaware, last week told Today: 'I lost everything and they want to erase me forever.' She added: 'It really hurts because when your peers vote you for Miss Congeniality, you work so hard to get to this position. I haven't been doing pageants for very long, this is all brand new to me.' Miss Longacre sobbed on camera on Friday saying she was devastated at losing the chance to represent the people of Delaware . The 24-year-old, who wants to be a social worker, said that the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization signed a contract saying that she could compete after she provided her birth certificate and driving license. Miss Longacre said that the Miss American pageant has ignored her attempts to contact them. First runner-up Brittany Lewis of . Wilmington was crowned last Thursday and will go on to represent . Delaware in the national competition. In . a statement to MailOnline on Friday, the Miss Delaware Scholarship . Organization said: 'Following the Miss Delaware Pageant, it was . determined that Amanda Longacre exceeded the age requirement in order to . be eligible to compete therefore, the Miss Delaware 2014 title is . awarded to Brittany Lewis. 'The Miss Delaware Pageant is proud to congratulate Brittany and wishes Amanda the very best on her future endeavors.'

She told Gawker: 'He was probably a bit too intoxicated to be there, but he seemed like a congenial drunk who was really excited to be at the show.' She said that he shared a table with two ladies who he asked to 'watch my shit' when he went to the bar. He brought them back drinks in souvenir mugs. He asked them where they were from and when they replied New York, he exclaimed: 'You're f****** kidding me!'

She giggled at Lauer's feigned protests, adding: 'Sorry.' The pair chatted over a cup of tea at an outdoor table in a sunny London garden. Miss Middleton, looking tanned in a low-cut white shirt with jeans and tasteful gold jewellery, said very little during the minute-long clip except to add: 'I was on my bike.'

"By . Louise Boyle . A rapist who preyed on women using online dating sites is facing life in prison after being found guilty on Monday. Former Navy Lieutenant Sean Banks, 38, was found . guilty of rape, rape of an intoxicated woman, forcible . digital penetration and residential burglary with intent to commit rape by a San Diego jury. He was found not guilty of attempting to dissuade a witness. Banks, of Del Mar, used dating sites ChristianMingle.com and Match.com to target two women. Sean Patrick Banks, 39, was convicted of five counts, including forcible rape and rape of an unconscious person. The defendant faces 40 years to life in prison when he is sentenced on September 5 . Banks preyed on his victims using online dating sites such as ChristianMingle and Match (stock image) During the trial, the two victims - named only as KK and RO - told the jury that Banks had raped them. KK met Banks through ChristianMingle.com. She testified that she met Banks because she 'believed in God, scripture, going to church, reading the Bible and I wanted someone who had those same interests', the LA Times reported. She invited him to her La Mesa home for a date on November 21, 2012 to watch a movie after weeks of talking and exchanging messages. She said Banks then dragged her from her living room to her bedroom and raped her. RO said Banks raped her in 2009 after they met on Match.com. During a police interview, the serviceman denied raping the women and dubbed KK 'crazy'. Banks did not testify at his trial. Under California state law, allegations of rape do not have to be corroborated, so no DNA evidence was presented at the trial. Former Navy Lieutenant Banks is facing up to 40 years in prison after being found guilty of the rape of two women in 2009 and 2012 . Banks' lawyer told NBC 7 that it was a 'he-said-she-said' case and that he is making plans for a new trial. The defense had argued that Banks left the women's homes when he was told to.

"By . Louise Boyle . The 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times in a violent attack by two classmates and left for dead has thanked the thousands of people who sent heartfelt messages of support and thousands of dollars towards her recovery. A photo was released this week of the girl's hands holding a homemade card covered in purple hearts which simply read 'thank you'. She was surrounded by some of the hundreds of messages sent from supporters around the world. The other picture showed a collage of these notes arranged on her bedroom wall. The unidentified middle-schooler was lured into the woods in Waukesha, Wisconsin on May 31 . by 'friends' Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, also 12, who planned to . kill her in order to gain access to the world of the mythical 'Slender . Man'. Scroll down for video . A picture of the 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times by two classmates last month was released this week. Her identity is protected bu the little girl holds a simple thank you message with a purple heart amid some of the thousands of messages of support she has received . A local artist decorated the 12-year-old's bedroom at her Waukesha, Wisconsin home with just some of the thousands of support letters she has received following the so-called 'Slender Man stabbing' last month . The girl survived the brutal stabbing . and was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist . found her and called 911. Along with the messages of love that have been sent to the little girl to aid in her recovery, the public has also donated $50,000 towards her medical expenses through a fundraising page. The family said in a statement: 'Our family would like to thank everyone who has supported our daughter on her miraculous road to recovery. 'Our little girl has received thousands of purple hearts from numerous countries and from most continents. We simply cannot put into words how grateful we are for the prayers, packages and heartfelt messages. We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support.' Her family spokesman told ABC that she is making a slow but steady recovery and had recently gone to watch a Disney movie with her dad. The family statement added: 'Together as a family, we continue to . adjust to our ''new normal''. She has a courageous heart and bravely deals . with both the physical and emotional challenges since the attack.' The parents of the 12-year-old victim of the 'Slender Man' stabbing said their daughter's condition is slowly improving. The girl is pictured being transported to the hospital after being stabbed 19 times by two classmates last month . Geyser and Weier have since been charged . as adults on counts of first-degree intentional homicide, and police . say they had been plotting the crime for month. Geyser's attorneys have asked that she receive a mental health evaluation. Weier and Geyser, are due back in . court on July 2. Neither has so far entered a plea. Both suspects told police they tried . to kill their friend because of their obsession with Slender Man, a . character they discovered on a website called Creepypasta Wiki, which is . devoted to horror stories. Geyser's obsession with the mythical . man was something her parents seemed to be aware of as well, as her . father proudly shared a crayon drawing his daughter drew of Slender Man . while they were out to dinner one night. But . far from being alarmed by the disturbing sketch, Morgan's father Matt . seemed to find it amusing and posted it on his social network account. Beneath the picture he wrote: 'Only Mogo (Morgan) draws Slenderman in crayon on a napkin when we are out to dinner'. Charged as adults: Morgan Geyser (left) and . Anissa Weier (right), both 12,  face 65 years in prison after admitting . to police that they stabbed the classmate in hopes of joining the cult of the 'Slender Man' In . an official police report, Weier said Slender Man is the ‘leader’ of . Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty. She . explained Geyser told her they needed slaughter their friend in order to become ‘proxies’ of Slender . Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest. They . planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion. Geyser . was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night. But . they changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a . bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew . there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down. When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband. They planned to play . hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of . sight, in the trees. The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth . that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009. On the left, a depiction of Slender Man and on the right, a drawing . Geyser drew of 'Slender' that her dad proudly posted on Instagram . It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed 19 times. Weier said the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood. But the fighter pushed on, and crawled out of the woods to safety where she waved down passing bicyclist Greg Steinberg. On Wednesday, audio of Steinberg's 911 call was released, in which he can be heard comforting the 12-year-old victim while paramedics rushed to the scene. Steinberg told the dispatcher that the girl had been stabbed, but was conscious. Morgan Geyser (left) and Anissa Weier (right) had planned to stab their classmate as a sacrifice to Slender Man . 'Yes, she's breathing,' he told the operator. 'She says she can take shallow breaths. She's alert.' Suspects . Geyser and Weier were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack. If convicted as adults, the girls face up to 65 years in prison. Geyser's family members broke into tears several times during her first court appearance on Monday. ‘The family is very horrified at what has happened,’ attorney Donna Kuchler said. If . moved into juvenile court and convicted, the girls could be held at . most until they were 25 years old, Waukesha County District Attorney . Brad Schimel told Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ‘It's a very shocking incident. There's no two ways about it,’ he added.

Boat captain Jamie Robert Bostwick climbed on to the back of the 30ft, 20-ton shark off the coast of Venice, Florida on June 6 . Mr Bostwick wrote on Facebook: 'The whale liked us holding his fin stayed right next to boat . Holding his fin while free diving has been on my bucket list for years... he was super calm w all.' The video clip shows the blue-grey shark dotted with white spots gliding along the side of the boat. The captain leaps into the water and grabs a hold of its dorsel fin, before being dragged along by the powerful shark. His son then jumps off the boat to join him and they both swim beside the powerful creature before it glides off. Mr Bostwick said that the shark stayed for 20 minutes and allowed three people to swim with it. Mr Bostwick, who is a Gulf charter captain, grabs on to the dorsel fin of the whale shark while his son looks on as it skims along in the Florida waters . The captain and his son both managed to get up close to the endangered species in a moment that was captured on video . The whale shark is a docile creature which feeds on plankton. It is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives for about 70 years. It is listed as endangered by The World Wildlife Fund as their numbers are dwindling due to demand in some parts of the world for their meat and fins. Dr. Bob Hueter, director of the Center for Shark Research at Mote Marine Laboratory told WSTP: 'They can't hurt you but we can hurt them with too much contact.' Disturbing the protective layer of mucus on their skin can affect the whale shark's long-term health. The docile whale sharks are easily identified in the water by their huge size, blue-grey skin and white markings .

"By . Associated Press . and Chris Pleasance . and Louise Boyle . Toronto's crack-smoking Mayor Rob Ford plans to return to work on June 30 after a two-month stay in rehab. Ford said he will resume his duties as mayor 'in the later portion of the afternoon', in a letter to the city clerk released today. He asked the clerk to restore his old office locks which were changed when he left. Ford is in rehab for alcohol addiction after announcing in April that he was seeking treatment. He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack. Ford admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials. Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford (pictured in June last year) plans to be back at home at the end of the month when he will launch his reelection campaign . The mayor of Canada's largest city has not abandoned his bid to seek a second term in October. Earlier this month, Ford released a picture on himself taking a dip in the pool at his rehab clinic. He also announced plans to launch his re-election campaign on July 1 - Canada Day. Ford . has been at the Greenestone facility in Ontario since checking himself . in on May 1 after another drunken rant was caught on camera. Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.' Speaking about his time in the clinic, Ford said he has been able to work out, relax and make some friends, though confessed he was missing his family. The only time he had seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he added that he was anxious to get back to them. On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledged that it was his own fault. He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. 'I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.' Ford was pictured looking glum outside the clinic last month, wearing an orange sweater, jeans and Crocs . 'I feel good. You are going to see a difference. You are going to see a healthier Rob Ford and I am going to win the election on Oct. 27.' The picture was the first time Ford had been seen inside the clinic, though last month he was pictured outside wearing . a bright orange Texas Longhorns sweater, jeans and Crocs. On that occasion, 44-year-old looked glum during the brisk stroll, despite earlier . calling the luxurious rehabilitation center 'amazing' and saying it . reminded him of 'football camp'. A week before that, he was seen in Bracebridge, which is about 25 miles east of the center. He was seen chatting with local residents, many of whom snapped pictures with him and posted them online. In a bizarre twist, he also made headlines last month when a former fellow resident at the clinic, 36-year-old LeeAnne Rob, was charged with drink-driving his SUV. She also suggested that she had left her watch in his room although the has since refused to comment on the nature of their relationship. He's . is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking, . but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' his lawyer Dennis Morris told the National Post. Speaking to the Toronto Sun at the start of the month, Ford said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the . self-imposed exile. 'It . reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I . went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am . learning about myself, my past and things like that.' Residence: The clinic has 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' with 'rustic suites', its website says . He . joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There . will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' He said the very public fall from grace - including a video of him smoking crack, being filmed while drunk and making lewd comments about his wife - was what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better,' he told the Sun reporter. He . said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the . morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city . pub. During the rant, he also claimed he was 'in a divorce' and staying at a hotel. He has been married to wife Renata since 2000. Out and about: Ford, 44, has been spotted in the nearby town of Bracebridge, where he has posed for photographs with fans . Out of control: Ford (pictured in January with Toronto's chief budget officer) found himself in deep water last year when a video emerged of him using crack cocaine. Others emerged of his drunken tirades . The . same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail . published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the . illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26 before apparently checking into GreenStone. On the centres website, it says: 'Located in a resort setting in scenic Muskoka, Ontario and equipped with holistic spa services, delicious, nutritious and seasonal menus offered through our Lodge Restaurant, and a full suite of fitness and recreation facilities.' Its accommodation consist of 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' that 'feature rustic suites.' Ford previously indicated to the Toronto Sun that his treatment could cost as much as $100,000. 'It’s worth every dime, every dime,' he said. 'A hundred grand is cheap. It’s a steal.'","Rob Ford plans to leave the GreeneStone facility at the end of the month .

Gabriel Rey O'Neill, 45, was charged with . murder and the special circumstances of committing murder in the course . of a rape, a kidnapping and an act of forced oral copulation, according to authorities on Monday. Hikers found the body of 27-year-old Sheila Lorraine Hatcher, a mother-of-three, in a ravine on San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County, California, on March 12, 1989. Gabriel O'Neill, 45, has been charged with raping and murdering 27-year-old Sheila Lorraine Hatcher in California 25 years ago . Sheriff's . Deputy Rebecca Rosenblatt said that Hatcher had been sexually assaulted and . suffered blunt force trauma. Investigators at the time were unable to . find sufficient evidence to identify a suspect. Last year, the victim's family asked sheriff's investigators to reopen the cold case. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, investigators discovered that O'Neill, Hatcher and three other people went to the mountain to use drugs. The group separated, leaving O'Neill alone with Hatcher. O'Neill, then 20, allegedly attacked, raped and killed Miss Hatcher and stole her jewellery. The exact relationship between the victim and O'Neill is still being established. After investigators pored over old records and case files, Rosenblatt said that evidence was resubmitted to the forensics lab which linked O'Neill to the killing. The officer would not elaborate further as the investigation is ongoing. Deputy Rosenblatt told MailOnline today that she had no details on the family's reaction to the potential solving of the murder but added: 'It always feels good when you can finally give a family some closure.' The suspect, who lives in Brisbane, had not been part of the original investigation. O'Neill is a registered sex offender, according to the San Jose Mercury News. O'Neill was taken into custody on Monday. If convicted, O'Neill could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have yet to make a decision on whether to seek lethal injection. The accused was booked into the Maguire Correctional Facility in Redwood City and is being held without bail.

"By . Louise Boyle . Drivers who use smartphone apps for directions as a cheaper method than costly sat-nav systems could soon find themselves at odds with government guidelines. The Department of Transportation (DOT) wants to regulate navigation aids of all kinds in cars including those that can be used on phones with a set of voluntary guidelines. Apps, like Google Maps, Apple Maps or Waze, are a grey area when it comes to varying state laws banning the use of making calls or texting on cellphones while driving. The Department of Transport is proposing a set of guidelines to curb the use of distracting apps, including those which cause directions, on smartphones but sources question whether they will be effective . As part of the Grow America Act announced last month, the Obama administration laid out plans to increase safety across all modes of transport. The measures would specify that authorities can restrict the use of apps - and bring in stricter rules - if they seem dangerous. The voluntary guidelines for built-in navigational systems in cars are supported by the car industry, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told MailOnline today. However it remains to be seen whether Silicon Valley will work with DOT over proposed voluntary guidelines on software such as map apps that could cause distractions. In a statement today, DOT said: 'In 2013, the Department of Transportation's . National Highway Traffic Safety Administration addressed built-in devices as . part of its voluntary Distracted Driving Guidelines and is currently in the . process of developing additional guidelines to address hand held devices, which . will be out for public comment later this year. 'Distracted driving is a deadly . epidemic that has devastating consequences on our nation’s roadways, taking . thousands of lives each year. Safety is our top priority and we’re working . to address all forms of distraction to reduce the amount of deaths and ensure . drivers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.' Critics claim that it will be too difficult for the government to keep up with - and keep track of -  the stream of new technology emerging from Silicon Valley. Catherine . McCullough, from the Intelligent Car Coalition, a non-profit . organization which represents the interests of the transportation and . technology industries, told The New York Times: 'They don’t have the . budget or the structure to oversee both Silicon Valley and the auto . industry.' Whether drivers can be criminally charged for using maps on their smartphones remains unclear. The Times provided an example of a California driver who was issued a $165 ticket for using a map on his iPhone - the decision was later reversed by a judge. Each day in the U.S., nine people are killed and 1,060 people are injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver. DOT laid out voluntary guidelines for the . car industry last year which said sat-navs should not take more than . two seconds for a single interaction - the time it takes a car at 60mph . to travel half the length of a football field. Google refused to comment after being contacted by MailOnline on Tuesday. Attempts to reach Apple, another of the biggest providers of smartphone . map apps, proved unsuccessful. Satellite navigational devices are already regulated by the federal government with the support of the auto industry .","The Transportation Department is proposing a set of regulations on navigation aids of all kinds in cars including smartphone apps .

"By . Louise Boyle . ABC news producer Dawn Ennis who changed gender three times was fired in May for 'performance-related issues' An ABC news producer who changed gender three times has been fired for 'performance-related issues', according to reports. Dawn Ennis, who was once known as Don Ennis, identified as both a man and a woman during a long career at the company. The producer, from Danbury, Connecticut, lost her job in May just a few weeks after transforming from her male identity. An industry source told the New York Daily News that Ennis losing the job was not because of gender-identity issues. ABC News declined to comment to MailOnline on Tuesday. In . May 2013, Don Ennis appeared at work wearing a black dress and an . auburn wig, and asked that co-workers call him Dawn. She reportedly . received a very public show of support from her longtime colleagues. The . father-of-three explained to colleagues that she believed her gender . mix-up was linked to her mother giving her oestrogen as a child to . prolong a childhood acting career. Ennis said she ended up developing breasts and thinking as a woman. Soon afterwards, the producer separated from wife Wendy after 17 years. Then three months after revealing her new identity to colleagues, the senior ABC employee returned to work as Don and claimed to have suffered from 'transient global amnesia'. Ennis said he had believed it was 1999 and thought that his wife had tricked him into dressing up as a woman. Don Ennis, pictured with his wife of 17 years Wendy, before he became a woman and the couple separated. They have three children . According to the New York Post, Ennis posted a memo on the newsroom bulletin board which read: 'I accused my wife of playing some kind of cruel joke, dressing me up in a wig and bra and making fake ID’s with the name ''Dawn'' on it. Seriously.' The journalist explained that while his memories of the last 14 years had returned, his female identity did not. In the memo, first reported on gossip site NewsBlues, Ennis added: 'I am writing to let you know I’m changing my name . . . to Don Ennis. That will be my name again, now and forever. And it appears I’m not transgender after all.' The producer thanked colleagues at ABC for their support and said that he hoped the experience would make it easier for the next transgender person at ABC. In May, 49-year-old Ennis became Dawn again. She was let go from the company soon afterwards. On May 31, she posted on Facebook: 'It is all going to work out.' On June 2, Dawn Ennis then published lines from Shakespeare's King Lear on her Facebook page, which read: 'No, I will weep no more. In such a night/ To shut me out? Pour on; I will endure.'","Dawn Ennis, formerly Don Ennis, identified as both a man and a woman during career at ABC News .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . A legend has grown up over the years that Rory McIlroy is a fair-weather golfer. A legend, it has to be said, that McIlroy has contributed handsomely towards both in word and hapless deed when the elements have turned unkind. So to Wentworth on Friday, where the forecast McIlroy had seen first thing predicting a pleasant 19 degrees turned out to be way wide of the mark, with the reality being a cold, wet and thoroughly miserable day. Thirty minutes after the end of his  second round, he still had no feeling in the little finger on his left hand and the thumb on his right. At the par-four  seventh hole, he had thinned a greenside bunker shot so badly he ended up with a double-bogey six. Bad start: Rory McIlroy began his round with back-to-back bogeys at Wentworth on Friday . Cheer up, Rory: The Northern Irishman made three birdies in the last four holes to end on one-under par . In short, and given all the other . distractions going on in his life, if ever there was a back nine to stop . drying the clubs with his towel and chuck it in instead, this was it. Happily, . and to the delight of the  thousands who trudged through the mud to . watch him, that was precisely what did not happen at the BMW PGA . Championship. On a course where he has no track record, the 25-year-old . from  Northern Ireland summoned  up commendable resolve to play the . final seven holes in four under par. To . put that sequence into  perspective, Ernie Els, the man who redesigned . this West course in 2010 and playing alongside him, completed them in . three over. It all added up . to a gutsy 71 for McIlroy and a heartening  two-round total of 139 . blows. Far from a weekend off, which has been his lot here for the past . two years, he has actually moved into the thick of contention on five . under par. Moving on: McIlroy split from Caroline Wozniacki earlier this week with the pair due to get married . Lining it up: McIlroy is five shots behind leaders Thomas Bjorn and Shane Lowry . After starting . the week with one dramatic statement, announcing he had split from . fiancee Caroline Wozniacki, he has put himself into position to make . another. There’s never a dull moment with the Northern Irishman, is . there? How characteristic . of his rollercoaster life that he should follow up his holed wedge shot . for an eagle two at the seventh on Thursday with a holy hash of a bunker . shot for a score no fewer than four shots worse on Friday. At . least he was consistent on the other hole where he claimed an eagle on . day one, the par-five 12th. This time he followed that up with a . seven-iron to 12 feet and rolled in the putt for a matching three. McIlroy . bogeyed the 13th but birdied three of the last four holes to lie joint . fifth on a leaderboard where the Dane Thomas Bjorn has been joined by . Irishman Shane Lowry. Bjorn . had a rough start but his play matched the weather as he improved the . longer the day went on. He finished with a 72 to stand on 10 under, . while Lowry birdied both of the last two holes to follow up his . impressive opening 64 with a 70. On the move: McIlroy has moved into contention for the Wentworth title with an impressive back nine . The . only player to beat McIlroy in his half of the draw was Spaniard Rafael . Cabrera-Bello, who is on six under after a second-round 73. The one . player to match him was feisty Swede Jonas Blixt, who showed his taste . for the big time with his runner-up finish in the Masters last month. ‘I really want to make Europe’s Ryder Cup team,’ he said, and he’s showing it. An . exciting weekend is in prospect, with Luke Donald going for his third . win in four years while the 18th green on Sunday could see the crowning . of a new world  No 1 once more. Henrik . Stenson shot 71 to stand on five under and he is nicely placed to limit . Adam Scott’s time at the top to one week and emulate the achievement of . Donald himself, who went to world No 1 by defeating Lee Westwood to win . this title in 2011. Donald . showed his liking for these acres once more with a fine round of 67, . featuring an amazing run of five threes in a row from the eighth, . representing three birdies, one eagle and a par. He is six under. Perched . on the periphery are the English triumvirate of Ian Poulter and Lee . Westwood on two under, with Justin Rose a further shot adrift.","McIlroy is five-under par heading into the weekend at Wentworth .

So after all the tears and tantrums, we finally have a triumph. ‘Hey Monty, try winning in America,’ Phil Mickelson once teased him in a note left in his locker, after Colin Montgomerie was bitching about a tee-time with the journeymen at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Well, now he has. Let others churlishly remark that it was on the old men’s circuit that he finally achieved it, that he used to proclaim you would never find him playing seniors golf in a million years (Monty contradicting himself? Surely not!). Or that you can’t count the Senior USPGA Championship as a real major. Silverware: Colin Montgomerie won the Senior PGA Championship in Michigan on Sunday . Special moment: Montgomerie finally won his first event in America at the 135th time of asking . Look down that illustrious leaderboard and you’ll understand why 50-year-old Monty will regard winning for the first time in America at the 135th time of asking on Sunday as one of the special moments of his career. In second place: Tom Watson. Third: Bernhard Langer. It doesn’t get much better, does it? It’s less than a month since Langer was finishing in the top 10 at the Masters. He’s a runaway leader on the grandiosely titled Champions Tour. Yet Monty wiped the floor with him. Did someone switch off that notorious temper once he reached 50? Did he finally realise you can’t pick a fight with American galleries and still win a major? Here was the Monty we always wanted to . see at a United States Open or the other USPGA. He always had the . talent, he had a  surplus of it. But here he added the  requisite calm . as well. Out in front: Montgomerie finished four shots clear of Tom Watson in Benton Harbor . Taunt: Phil Mickelson once joked about Montgomerie's inability to win in America . It’s almost 20 years since he contested a play-off for the US Open with Ernie Els in the boiling heat of Pittsburgh. On the telly in the clubhouse, a cavalcade of police vehicles were on the Los Angeles highways in mad pursuit of the celebrated American footballer OJ Simpson, suspected (later controversially cleared) of murdering his wife, Nicole. It wasn’t long before Monty was giving vain chase to the Big Easy. His face was so red he looked ready to explode. Not for the first or last time we thought: ‘How can he hope to win in such a rage?’ There were many other near misses, of course. None was more painful than 2006 at Winged Foot. One hole to go and my boss sent me an excited text: ‘He’s only going to go and finally do it, isn’t he?’ One double bogey later, and we had the painful riposte: ‘Sadly not.’ Drought: Monty never won one of golf's majors, coming agonisingly close at the US Open . ‘I’ve got a full diary on Tuesday and it is going to be a bit strange going back to giving lessons after this.’ It’s back on the range at The Rayleigh in Essex for 30-year-old Mark Hooper after playing with US Open champion Justin Rose in the final round of the BMW PGA Championship. Hooper claimed his place in the field after winning the PGA’s East Region order of merit last year with season’s earnings of around £12,000. On Sunday, he finished a highly creditable 38th and won £24,000. How lovely to see him so becalmed and for . all the crucial putts to drop. How delicious to see the golfing gods . indulge in a little mischief on the 18th, as a rare wayward approach . cannoned off the grandstand and back into the middle of the green. It wouldn’t have mattered where it had bounced, he was so far ahead by that stage, but clearly the heavens had decided: there you go, Monty, there’s the luck we never gave you when you were raging at us and bemoaning your fortune. This was the first time in 25 years that the Scot didn’t compete in the PGA Championship at Wentworth but there was still no ignoring him, even while the tournament was conjuring up its memorable finish. And now he’s bested Watson and Langer. Major Montgomerie. That always did have a certain ring to it. McIlroy and Scott set to dominate . Honestly, you wait ages for one of the world’s elite to win a tournament and then two come along at once. No sooner had Rory McIlroy won for the first time since declaring himself free and single again than Adam Scott was winning for the first time as a married man. Scott’s impressive triumph in a play-off against USPGA champion Jason Dufner in Texas on Sunday came seven days after he achieved his lifetime goal of becoming world No 1 and meant he can enjoy it for a while longer. Champion: Rory McIlory won the PGA Championship at Wentworth days after splitting from Caroline Wozniacki . How does it fit? Adam Scott won the Crowne Plaza Invitational after beating Jason Dufner in a play-off . But now he’s got the bit between his teeth again, what price McIlroy, back up to world No 6, chasing him down before the summer is out to reclaim top spot? I’ve remarked before that, if everyone was playing their best golf, these two would be a half-step ahead. Let’s hope Sunday was a foretaste of things to come and this proves to be the summer when they develop a fully fledged friendly rivalry. And if they do, Rory will come out on top.","Colin Montgomerie won Senior PGA Championship in Michigan .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Billions of dollars in U.S. taxes are going unpaid because Americans are exploiting Swiss bank accounts - and the U.S. government has failed to aggressively pursue the bank helping them to do it. The bank, Credit Suisse, has provided accounts in Switzerland for more than 22,000 U.S. clients totaling $10 billion to $12 billion, according to a report issued by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday. So far the government has received only 238 names of U.S. citizens with secret accounts at Credit Suisse, or just 1 per cent of the estimated total, the investigation concluded. Credit Suisse recruited U.S. clients between 2001 and 2008, helped them conceal the . accounts from the Internal Revenue Service and enabled misconduct by . bank employees, the subcommittee said. Hidden cash: Switzerland's second largest bank, Credit Suisse, has provided accounts in Switzerland for more than 22,000 U.S. clients totaling $10 billion to $12 billion, helping them skip U.S. taxes . On Tuesday, Senator John McCain said the offshore tax practices operated by Credit Suisse and other institutions had cost US taxpayers $337.3bn in potential revenue - 'the largest amount of tax revenue lost due to evasion in the world'. For five years, the Senate panel has been examining Swiss banks' use of secrecy laws to enable tax evasion by Americans. The main focus of its latest report was Credit Suisse. The Senate subcommittee asserted that . the Swiss government, with its famous banking secrecy, has continued to . obstruct U.S. authorities' ability to learn the names of U.S. bank . customers and former customers. The . report detailed cloak-and-dagger tactics used by Credit Suisse bankers . who were said to travel to the United States to secretly service . accounts and recruit customers - including at golf tournaments in . Florida and the annual 'Swiss Ball' in New York. Anger: Senator Carl Levin, the subcommittee's chairman (pictured in 2013) said the bank 'aided and abetted U.S. tax evasion' at a press conference on Tuesday . Over . breakfast at a hotel, one banker handed a U.S. customer bank statements . hidden in a Sports Illustrated magazine, the report said. The bank . filed visa applications for employees that falsely portrayed them as . tourists and maintained a New York office with lists of middlemen who . set up offshore shell companies for some U.S. customers, the committee . asserted. Credit Suisse . 'aided and abetted U.S. tax evasion, not only from behind a veil of . secrecy in Switzerland, but also on U.S. soil by sending Swiss bankers . here to open hidden accounts,' Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich), the subcommittee's chairman, said at a news conference Tuesday. Levin . said the Justice Department has failed to use the U.S. legal tools with . Credit Suisse that were used earlier to pry the names of U.S. account . holders from No. 1 Swiss bank UBS. Last week, ahead of the release of the Senate's report, Credit Suisse agreed to pay out $197 million to regulators after admitting to serving thousands of U.S. clients without approval. The settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed that Credit Suisse never registered cross-border securities that served 8,500 clients between 2002 and 2008. The accounts were valued at around $5. 6 billion and the bank collected $82 million in fees, it said. Analysts have said they expect a possible settlement with the US Department of Justice following the investigation may produce an even higher fine. It comes after seven Credit Suisse bankers were indicted in 2011. The senator's report said that neither the bank nor its bankers have yet been held accountable. The Justice Department has instead used treaty requests for the names, relying on Swiss courts and getting stymied, he said. 'It's time to ramp up the collection of taxes due from tax evaders on the billions of dollars hidden offshore,' Levin urged. Responding . to the report in a statement, the Justice Department said it is . investigating up to 14 Swiss financial institutions, 'and we won't . hesitate to indict if and when circumstances merit'. It did not name the . banks. In its statement, the Justice . Department said that since 2009, it has charged 73 account holders, and . 35 bankers and advisers with violations related to offshore tax evasion. Justice . officials are scheduled to testify and explain the government's actions . at a hearing Wednesday by the subcommittee. Also expected to testify . are four executives of Credit Suisse, including CEO Brady Dougan. Credit Suisse has responded to the report, saying that suggestions that the bank's executives aimed to improperly report financial figures were inaccurate. It claimed it has been 'working hard' to get rid of undeclared U.S. assets since an investigation began in 2008. The . spotlight on Americans' use of Swiss accounts comes amid a debate in . Washington over whether and how to raise revenue to help reduce the . budget deficit. Many . Democrats say the government is missing out on billions because . companies are stashing profits abroad to avoid taxes. Republicans want . to cut the corporate tax rate and ease the tax burden on money that U.S. companies make abroad to encourage companies to invest at home. 'Working hard': Brady W. Dougan, CEO of Credit Suisse, (pictured earlier this month) called the claims 'inaccurate' and said the bank had been working to get rid of undeclared U.S. assets . In the UBS case, the Justice Department threatened the bank with criminal prosecution. UBS entered a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in 2009. It agreed to pay $780 million in fines and turn over 4,400 names of customers suspected of evading U.S. taxes. Some of those individuals have been prosecuted. Others have paid penalties and back taxes under an IRS voluntary disclosure program that lets those who come forward pay less than they owe. The program has resulted in 43,000 taxpayers coming forward about their offshore accounts and paying $6 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties, according to the government. But Justice has failed to pursue most of the UBS account holders and hasn't actively pursued Credit Suisse, Levin and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the panel's senior Republican, said at the news conference. Credit Suisse disclosed in 2011 that it was the target of a criminal investigation by Justice. Credit Suisse and UBS are on a list of 29 'global systemically important banks' whose failures would be considered a threat to the entire financial system. Credit Suisse shares fell 3.165 to 27.31 Swiss francs in Zurich on Wednesday. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","A Senate investigation has found Credit Suisse has provided accounts in Switzerland for 22,000 Americans totaling $10 billion to $12 billion .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . One look at Rory McIlroy told you that a life of splendour and a world of riches is still no protection from the turmoil caused by affairs of the heart. Here was Rory with all the  privileges stripped away, just another 25-year-old struggling like so many with true love and all that it means. During his short press conference at Wentworth on Wednesday, he answered one question with the distant look of a man with his mind placed firmly somewhere else. There was one awful moment  during another when he looked like he might lose it completely. In the balance: Rory McIlroy's split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki has threatened his chances in the PGA Championship . Happy couple: McIlroy proposed to tennis player Wozniacki in December . Going steady: The pair had been an item for over two years . Down: The pair (pictured last week) only sent out invitations to their wedding at the weekend . This was McIlroy as we have not seen . him, wrought and strung-out. A man who did not appear in any fit mental . state to make a decent fist of playing in the European Tour’s flagship . event, the BMW PGA Championship which, lest we forget, begins on Thursday. Who . knows the reason for the break-up, which comes only a few days after . the wedding invitations were sent out. Less than a month ago, Caroline . Wozniacki was talking of starting a family and McIlroy was tweeting a . photo of their scenic location for dinner only last Friday. Let us hope there really is nothing more to it than the official explanation of cold feet. But the news certainly caught everyone cold on the practice ground. ‘I’m surprised, I think we all must be,’ said Luke Donald. Typical . McIlroy, to front up and answer questions when things have gone wrong. What he must surely be asking himself, though, is why things are always . going off track.Here was one more twist to the  legend: ‘It always seems . to happen to Rory.’ One of these days he will have a season where all the talk is about golf but it doesn’t look as if it will be any time soon. Nice to see you: McIlroy is offered words of wisdom from television legend Sir Bruce Forsyth . In awe: Man United fan McIlroy played alongside Phil Neville, Teddy Sheringham and Peter Schmeichel . Hero status: McIlroy was distracted by Sheringham, who won the Treble with United in 1999 . Gobsmacked: Schmeichel won five Premier League titles during a successful stay at Old Trafford . Gift: Neville presented McIlroy with a United shirt which appeared to brighten his mood . The main man: Sheringham, Schmeichel and Neville watch on McIlroy takes a shot . This . time last year the break-up in question was with his manager, Conor . Ridge. The year before that he made the startling confession that he had . taken his eye off the ball. ‘I’ve . spent enough time with lawyers this year to last me a lifetime,’ he . said wistfully last November. Now, as we head into the meat of the . season with this prestigious event followed by three majors in as many . months before the Ryder Cup in September, here we go again. Fifteen . months ago, Ernie Els got to play with Rory when his mind was whirling . so much he walked off the course at the Honda Classic after nine holes. On Thursday afternoon, the great South African will get another close-up of a . distracted McIlroy as they have been drawn together in the first round. How . on earth can you play with such a huge obstacle between you and . thinking clearly? The only thing McIlroy’s got going for him today is . that he has had plenty of practice, although perhaps nothing quite so . distracting as this. ‘I’m . not going to lie, I think it is going to be very difficult,’ said . McIlroy. ‘When I get inside the ropes I’m just going to try to . concentrate on the shot at hand but that’s easier said than done.’ Fatherly advice: McIlroy speaks to his Dad, Gerry McIlroy ahead of the PGA Championship at Wentworth . Sergio . Garcia was so cut up after he was dumped by Greg Norman’s daughter . Morgan-Leigh that eventually he took some time away from the game. ‘I’ll . definitely be putting an arm around Rory’s shoulder and asking if he . wants to talk about it,’ said the Spaniard. ‘I’ve been through it from . both sides. I split up with Martina Hingis but Morgan was the one who . left me. It should be easier if it’s mutual but when it is a really . painful break-up the temptation to throw yourself into golf more than . ever doesn’t always work out. Every case is different but for me I had . to stop playing for a while.’ Right . now, McIlroy is determined to plough on. In eight strokeplay . tournaments this year, he has finished outside the top 10 only once but . now that consistent spell of form has to be set against yet another . off-course complication. A friend in need: Sergio Garcia will offer McIlroy someone to talk to if he needs . Donald . said: ‘Obviously I wish both of them the best but I’m guessing this is . going to be very  distracting for Rory. We know how hard this game is . when you have a clear mind, and I can’t imagine what’s going through his . head now.’ McIlroy . stepped back into the public spotlight on Wednesday with three former . Manchester United footballers for company, in the shape of Peter . Schmeichel, Teddy Sheringham and Phil Neville. A lifelong United fan, . he must have been thinking a week ago that this was a pro-am round he . could really savour, rather than a chore. Now . there was a rueful grin as he shook hands with each in turn. His dad . Gerry was there beside the first tee as well, offering moral support. This . time last year the build-up to this tournament was overshadowed by an . ill-advised remark from  Garcia about Tiger Woods, made at an awards . dinner designed to celebrate the winning of the Ryder Cup. Now it is . affairs of the heart that have taken the place of matters of race. It . is such a shame. Just like last year, a heck of a golf tournament is . bursting to break out on Thursday. This is the 60th anniversary of the PGA and . the biggest one yet, with record crowds expected to descend on this . beautiful corner of England to greet virtually everyone who is anyone in . the European game. Let us hope it emerges. But, right now, McIlroy’s bombshell is the only topic in town. All change then: McIlroy posted this tweet just last week which didn't indicate any problems . Since meeting in July 2011, Rory McIlroy and Caroline Wozniacki have had their fair share of career ups and downs...2011: . McIlroy - Comes 64th at the USPGA, leaves his management team and finishes the year ranked World No 3. Wozniacki - Loses to Serena Williams in US Open semi-final and ends the year as World No 1 for the second time. 2012: . McIlroy - Wins the USPGA, the Ryder Cup, tops the European and US money lists and is World No 1. Wozniacki - Makes Australian Open quarter-final but loses in the first round at Wimbledon and the US Open. 2013: . McIlroy - Signs a $155m Nike deal but loses form, quits the Honda Classic mid-round and drops to World No 6. Wozniacki - Fails to make it past the fourth round in any of the Grand Slams, but maintains her top 10 ranking. 2014: . McIlroy - Starts with seven top 10 finishes but drops to World No 11 in April, his lowest ranking in three years. Wozniacki - A change of racket and injuries see her struggling for form and drop out of the world's top 10.","McIlroy looked affected by the split from his fiancee Caroline Wozniacki .

"By . Joe Bernstein . If the Manchester United players are in any doubt about what their new boss Louis van Gaal requires from them, a coaching manual he wrote in Holland but never translated into English is a good place to start. Modestly entitled ‘Visie’ (Vision), the great man outlines his philosophy in words that would be clear to even the biggest football simpleton. ‘My training is based on an attacking style of football. Never defensive!’ is the emphatic message, complete with self-penned exclamation mark. The full-on lesson continues: ‘To destruct the organisation of the opposition my team must pass the ball around at the highest possible speed with a terrific use of all positions. When we lose the ball I don’t want my team to run backwards, I want them to win it back in the quickest possible time.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch a very interesting talk from van Gaal on tactics and arrogance . One vision: New Manchester United boss Van Gaal's philosophy is to play attacking football . All smiles: Wayne Rooney (third left) and his Manchester United team-mates take a stroll through Los Angeles . Hard wirk: The United squad are put through their paces during Saturday's training session in California . Workout: New boy Luke Shaw (left) trains alongside Tom Cleverley and fellow defender Rafael . Most intriguingly, ‘Visie’ - written after he had achieved huge international success with Barcelona - espouses the view that a great technical player must also be great tactically, and vice-versa. ‘I deliberately call my training models technical/tactical, because in my sessions one is linked to the other,’ he wrote. ‘I will be right on top of every player, demanding each player will give the maximum in each passing session.’ As United’s stars lap up the rays in California ahead of their first match of the Van Gaal era against Los Angeles Galaxy on Wednesday, the 62-year-old’s vision is both a motivation and a warning. For all his incredible achievements with Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and the Dutch national team, Van Gaal has never coached a British player before and he is intrigued as much as anyone else by whether British players can cope with his demands. Stay happy: Van Gaal has been upset in the past when he feels he failed as manager at Ajax and Holland . Van Gaal does not want to turn Old Trafford into ‘Little Holland’ but such are the potential tactical deficiencies among the English players he is inheriting a couple of reinforcements are needed, particularly with Michael Carrick sidelined for three months with ankle-ligament damage sustained in training on Thursday. Dutch World Cup star Daley Blind is his first priority. The 24-year-old Ajax player showed in Brazil, where he helped Van Gaal’s Holland reach the semi-final, that he is infinitely better at adapting to different positions than Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young, Phil Jones or Chris Smalling, for example. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward will be politely asked to secure the signature of Blind in the face of growing interest from Barcelona. He can play left-back, wing-back or holding midfield. His father Danny was one of Van Gaal’s assistants in Brazil. And another Dutch international, Kevin Strootman, will arrive from Roma by January at the latest. He would already be at Old Trafford if not for a knee injury that forced him to miss the World Cup. Wanted man: Left-back Daley Blind, who impressed for Holland at the World Cup, is Van Gaal's first priority . Better late than never: Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman would already be at Old Trafford but for injury . Van Gaal hopes that three ‘Dutchies’ - Robin van Persie is already in situ - will be enough and that the British players can adapt to his philosophy. Some managers such as Roberto Martinez feel English players are tactically aware if coached properly. Other foreign bosses became frustrated having to repeat themselves in training. Those included Sven Goran Eriksson, Fabio Capello and Rafael Benitez. Van Gaal himself spoke of the need for the United players to ‘click’ with his ideas when he made an impressive debut in front of the world’s media at Old Trafford last week. And in a separate interview with the club’s in-house television station MUTV, he was honest enough to state: ‘I know all the players and how they have played football under the direction of Moyes or Ferguson or Hodgson. But I want to know them personally, and also how they perform to my philosophy.’ Plans: Van Gaal insists his new squad of players must 'click' with his ideas for the club . Traditionally, Van Gaal’s sides play with attacking flair, with players expected to interchange positions depending on their opponents. Blind is perfect. He could cover the absence of Carrick and also fill in for teenager Luke Shaw when asked, as United are close to selling their other left-back, Patrice Evra, to Juventus. Former England manager Steve McClaren, who like Van Gaal has also worked in Holland and Germany, said in a recent interview that he believes it is harder to instruct English players on tactical issues. The current Derby County boss said: ‘Dutch players are very strong technically and tactically. It comes about from the way they are brought up by the clubs from an early age. ‘At Twente, the 11-year-old youth players would watch first-team games on video and be set homework on a certain tactical aspect. It develops a very strong tactical understanding of the game from a very early age. Everybody in the Netherlands is a coach. Differences: Steve McClaren, who has managed in Holland and England, believes it is harder to instruct English players on tactical issues . ‘Both the Dutch and Germans respect the mental strength of English players and the physicality of the game. But there is not a lot of respect for the coaching cultures and systems in England. ‘There is a lack of technical and tactical work in how our players are coached from a young age compared to other nations.’ With no European football, Woodward is also under pressure to sell players to reduce the United squad to a manageable size. Anderson and Bebe aren’t on the US tour while winger Nani is a target for AC Milan. Rooney is eager to please Van Gaal but after being Moyes’s favoured son and signing a lucrative new five-year deal last season, he will have to prove himself all over again. His past off-the-field antics will almost certainly rule him out of securing his dream of being United captain. As a player, he will have to buy into Van Gaal’s preference for moving the ball quickly, willingness to win the ball back and be a model citizen off the pitch; standards that saw the coach fall out with Franck Ribery and Luca Toni at Bayern Munich when they fell below them. High standards: Van Gaal fell out with Franck Ribery and Luca Toni during his spell as Bayern Munich manager . The last word should go to Van Gaal. In the chapter entitled ‘Practise’, he emphasises: ‘Essential in my eyes to improve the players, young and old, is to repeat drills. ‘In the beginning they think they are doing the same thing over and over again. I will hammer on the way they pass, the way they control and pass again. This must be done in an incredibly high tempo.’ In the next couple of weeks, United will limber up for the new season with matches in Los Angeles, Denver, Washington DC, Ann Arbor, and possibly Miami. A couple of them sound like great holiday places, but make no mistake, it’ll be hard work proving themselves to their Dutch master. It’s all about the vision.","Louis van Gaal outlines football philosophy in coaching manual he wrote in Holland .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Snapping her fingers and swinging her arms as she walked down the fairway, Lucy Li completed a runaway victory in the sectional qualifier for the US Women’s Open at Half Moon Bay in her native California on Monday. Bearing in mind 1,622 women representing 46 American states and 51 other countries entered this tortuous qualifying process for the chance to play at Pinehurst next month, to win her own particular 36-hole marathon by seven shots was some achievement. But here’s the extraordinary thing: Li is aged just 11. History: Eleven-year-old Li has become the youngest player to qualify for the US Women's Open . Watching brief: Li impressed at the Drive, Chip and Putt Championships at August in April . And so if it wasn’t enough that she . got to putt on the 18th green at Augusta National in April as the . runaway winner in her age division in the club’s first Drive, Chip and . Putt Championship for juniors — heck, what chance did anyone else stand? — now she gets to play in a full-blown major, as the youngest-ever . qualifier. Li got into golf . only four years ago, and then it was by chance. She was bored waiting . for her brother and cousin, who were playing in a tournament, so she hit . a few balls on the driving range. It . wasn’t long before she became a student at the Jim McLean golf school . in Florida. Five months after picking up her first club, she was . finishing third in her first tournament. No . category has been helped by technology quite as much as young females. The clubs are so light these days they are compensating for a natural . lack of strength, and it allows someone like Li to cultivate a . fabulous-looking golf swing with sumptuous balance and grace even at her . tender age. Last Sunday, . the amazing New Zealander Lydia Ko, just 17 and the world No 3 already, . had the chance to reach the summit before fading a little on the last . day of the Kingsmill Championship in Virginia. It’s only a matter of . time, of course, before she reaches the top. She might even do it before . her 18th birthday. Child prodigy: Li putting on the 10th hole at the 2013 US Women's Public Links golf event in Norman . The . youngest females to play in the US Women’s Open before Li were Americans . Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson, who were 12. The obvious danger is . that such bright lights will be extinguished by the time their teenage . years are over, but Pressel, 25, and Thompson, 19, have both avoided . burn-out to become major champions in their own right. Indeed, on the day Li was winning at Augusta, Thompson was putting the finishing touches to her maiden major triumph. Working . with noted coach McLean has allowed Li to meet some of the world’s best . already, including Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose and Thompson.  It’s the . mop-haired Ulsterman who’s her idol, however. ‘Rory . is so nice, isn’ t he?’ she coos. To think, it wasn’t that long ago . that Rory McIlroy was the fresh-faced kid looking up at his heroes. Now, . at the ripe age of 25, the generation he’s inspiring are already making . waves. So many, like Ko, Li . and Michelle Wie, have Asian heritage. Indeed, the greatest boon in the . history of golf was not inspired by Tiger Woods winning the Masters . aged 21 but the Korean Se Ri Pak winning the US Women’s Open in 1998. It . provoked phenomenal interest in the Far East, which manifests itself . today in the great number of talented Asian golfers who are  making such . an impression on the world game. The greatest performance by a girl was . still probably Wie getting within a shot of making the halfway cut in a . men’s PGA Tour event at the age of just 14, the 2004 Sony Open in her . native Hawaii. She beat Adam Scott, among  others, that day, and look . where he is now. But earning . your place in the field for the biggest event in women’s golf by seven . shots at the age of 11 is startlingly impressive. Come out swinging: The 11-year-old will become the youngest-ever participant at a US Women's Open . Asked . to name her favourite moment in golf history, Li provoked another sharp . intake of breath in going for Francis Ouimet’s win in the 1913 US Open. Tell me: is there another 11-year-old who’s even heard of Ouimet? She . probably pronounced his name properly as well. So . to storied Pinehurst and a women’s Open that was already historic for . the fact it would be the first to be held back to back with the men’s US . Open on the same course, albeit a version several hundred yards . shorter.  Now here comes Li, snapping her fingers and swinging her arms. It is just one of the many reasons why she stands out in the crowd. Michelle Wie: At just 11, she won both the Hawaii State Women's Stroke Play Championship - became the youngest player ever to qualify for an LPGA event, and the youngest (13) to ever make the cut at a US Women's Open. Lexi Thompson: Previously the youngest ever (12) to qualify for the US Women's Open. Now 19, she won the Kraft Nabisco Championship this year. Guan Tianlang: Made the cut at last year's Masters at the age of 14.","Li will be at Pinehurst on June 19 after winning at Half Moon Bay .

"By . Joe Bernstein . Having slogged his way around the lower leagues for 25 years, Sean Dyche has suddenly become popular and fashionable after taking Burnley into the promised land of the Premier League. He has been granted the flattering nickname ‘Ginger Mourinho’, while agents have been bombarding him all summer with phone calls, faxes and emails because he has money to burn. Or at least that’s what they think. The reality is a little different as Dyche is keen to point out in a typically forthright way. Ginger Mourinho: Burnley manager Sean Dyche is determined to succeed in the Premier League . On the up: Dyche led Burnley to promotion to the Premier League against all the odds last season . ‘One agent sent a message to tell me his player was available at €15million and wanted £45,000-a-week salary, net,’ he says. ‘My reply was two words: “Wrong club.” ‘I was thinking, at least do your homework. It’s not going to happen at that level at Burnley. I’m not stupid and I know we’ve got to be competitive but would I do that and rip the heart out of the club? No, it’s not my style.’ It’s neat symmetry that 24 hours after Premier League superstars like Sergio Aguero and Mesut Ozil do battle in tonight’s World Cup Final, Dyche will take his assortment of youngsters, journeymen and cut-price signings to Austria for a pre-season training camp he hopes will get them ready for the toughest challenge of their lives. Whereas Arsenal bought Alexis Sanchez for £35m this week, Dyche’s five summer signings so far have cost £2m: Michael Kightly (£1.5m), Marvin Sordell (£500,000) and freebies Matt Taylor, Matt Gilks and Steven Reid. Survival looks impossible until you start listening to Dyche. Firstly, he tells you Burnley were sixth-favourites to be relegated from The Championship last season and had only 18 outfield players to choose from. They won automatic promotion. Joy: Michael Kightly celebrates scoring the goal which ensured promotion for Burnley last season . Signings: Dyche has only spent £2m on the signings of Marvin Sordell (left), Matt Gilks (centre), Matt Taylor (right) as well as Steven Reid and Michael Kightly . Secondly, Tony Pulis and Crystal Palace showed that, with the right attitude and spirit, anything is possible. Palace were written off like Burnley and finished 11th in last season’s Premier League. Most importantly, Dyche won’t allow his squad - whose crown jewels are England under-21 striker Danny Ings and £5million-rated defender Kieran Trippier - to feel any fear. ‘We are leaving Burnley-world and going into the reality of Premier League-world but it’s not scary,’ he insists. ‘I know if you catch some of those top boys like Aguero and Sanchez when they are on a hot day, you can get badly hurt. But without being disrespectful, they are still human. They have ups and downs, no player no matter how valuable can be a magician every single week. ‘We are built on a real group mentality rather than individuals. If we bought one big star you’d get this weird thing in the camp. You’d have baggage of all the players who have done well for you whose contracts are nowhere near that of the signing you’ve just made. ‘It would hurt us so, if my chairman came to me and said “Look, we will buy that £20m player”, I would say I don’t think it is appropriate for this club at this time. It would harm the group and unquestionably we have talent here already.’ Big money: Arsenal have just spent £35m on Alexis Sanchez but Dyche will not spend beyond Burnley's means . Emulate: Dyche wants to repeat the achievements of Tony Pulis and Crystal Palace by staying up . Star men: Burnley's Keiran Trippier (left) and Danny Ings (right) could be pivotal to survival success . Burnley have been here before of course. They were in the Premier League in 2009/10 and famously beat Manchester United at Turf Moor early in the season. But manager Owen Coyle jumped ship for Bolton midway through the campaign and they were relegated. Now given a second chance, Burnley could make as much as £120m from promotion. Dyche is adamant it won’t be frittered away, and knows all about getting value for money after a 17-year playing career in the lower echelons with Chesterfield, Bristol City, Luton, Millwall, Watford and Northampton, and a short managerial stint at Watford. ‘One of the first things we did at Burnley this summer was to get the diggers in to lay new fibre sand-based training pitches. The weather up here means we need them, trust me. ‘They turn a tap on at the end of October and don’t turn it off again until the end of March. Our pitches down the bottom end of the training ground got waterlogged last season and were unusable. It’s a miracle my hair is still ginger.’ Ah, the hair. Dyche’s short, red hair and beard, coupled with a voice that is a permanent rasp, mean he is set to be one of the cult figures in the new Premier League season. Don't write us off: The work ethic which Dyche demands from his players could help keep Burnley up . Under-stated: Dyche will not get carried away by Burnley's success last season and will look to progress . Even friends like Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who worked with Dyche at Watford, now refers to him as the ‘Ginger Mourinho’. Dyche will meet the real one when Burnley face Chelsea on the opening weekend of the season. ‘It’s just banter, isn’t it?’ smiles Dyche. ‘My mates give me some stick about the name but it’s just a bit of fun. If I do half as well as him I’ll be all right. ‘What I will say is that we are very aligned with the culture and environment we have built for the players and I don’t think that can change in any successful organisation.’ Two days in Austria have been set aside from regular football practise. One will deal with physical endurance, the other mental toughness. Last summer, the players were driven to the point of exhaustion pushing giant tyres at an army boot camp. When they were on their knees, Dyche ordered them to sprint for 60 seconds. ‘We knew we had a small group and challenges would come our way where they would be tested to the limit but we had the experience of pre-season to fall back on,’ he explains. ‘The base requirement for a footballer is that you have to be physically and mentally strong, never more so than in the Premier League where you are under constant scrutiny. ‘But out of six weeks’ pre-season, it’s only two days. The rest of the time it’s football, football, football. ‘People have pre-conceptions about me because of my appearance, they think I must shout and bawl at my players, but that is so far from the reality. ‘I like to give the players lots of information about what we do. That’s the way I wanted managers and coaches to treat me when I was a player – but it didn’t often happen.’ Apprenticeship: Dyche enjoyed a playing career in the lower leagues before becoming a manager with Watford .","Dyche slogged around in the lower leagues for 25 years before promotion .

"By . Helen Pow . and Associated Press . Clayton Lockett spent forty minutes writhing in agony before dying of a heart attack . The White House says a botched execution of a death row inmate in Oklahoma fell short of the humane standards required when the death penalty is carried out. Officials halted Clayton Lockett's execution Tuesday when he convulsed violently and tried to lift his head after a doctor declared him unconscious. He later died of an apparent heart attack after spending 40 minutes writhing in pain. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that President Barack Obama believes evidence shows the death penalty doesn't effectively deter crime. That said, Carney reiterated that Obama believes some crimes are so heinous that the death penalty is merited. He said the crimes in Lockett's case are indisputably heinous. But Carney says the U.S. has a fundamental standard that the death penalty must be carried out humanely. He says everyone would recognize that this case fell short. The White House statement comes after the parents of Lockett's victim, Stephanie Neiman, released a note via the local NBC affiliate, which they are believed to have written before the execution. 'God blessed us with our precious daughter, Stephanie for 19 years. Stephanie loved children. She worked in Vacation Bible School and always helped with our Church nativity scenes. She was the joy of our life. We are thankful this day has finally arrived and justice will finally be served,' the handwritten note reads. It was signed 'Susie and Steve Neiman, 4-29-14' though it has not been confirmed whether or not they wrote the note before or after the botched execution. Scroll down for video . The victim's parents: Lockett was executed for killing Stephanie Neiman and her parents are believed to have written this note- dated on the same day as his death- before the execution . Remembering Stephanie: Her religious parents praised the charity work she did with children during her too-short life . Attempts to reach the Neimans, whose listed phone number has been disconnected, were not immediately successful. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin is calling for an independent review of the state's execution protocols after an inmate had an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after his execution began. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Fallin said Oklahoma Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Thompson would lead the review of the lethal injection protocol. Lockett, 38, who was found guilty of shooting a woman and watching his friends bury her alive, was declared unconscious ten minutes after the first of the state's new three-drug lethal injection combination was administered. Three minutes later, though, he began breathing heavily, writhing, clenching his teeth and straining to lift his head off the pillow. It later emerged his vein had ruptured. Oklahoma Department of Corrections director Robert Patton, left, called off the failed execution. Lockett was sentenced to death for shooting Stephanie Neiman, right, and watching his friends bury her alive . The blinds were eventually lowered to . prevent those in the viewing gallery from watching what was happening . in the death chamber, and the state's top prison official eventually . called a halt to the proceedings. Local media present said Mr Lockett sat up and said 'something’s wrong' 13 minutes into the procedure. 'It was a horrible thing to witness. This was totally botched,' said Lockett's attorney, David Autry. Witness Ziva Branstetter told broadcaster MSNBC Lockett was thrashing about and appeared to be in pain. 'His . body was sort of bucking. He was clenching his jaw. Several times he . mumbled phrases that were largely unintelligible,' she said. Republican Gov. Mary Fallin ordered stay of execution for Charles Warner who was scheduled to die two hours after Lockett . A Tulsa World newspaper claimed that Lockett was 'still alive,' and lifted his head as prison officials lowered the blinds. Tuesday was the first time Oklahoma used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug combination. Other . states have used it before; Florida administers 500 milligrams of . midazolam as part of its three-drug combination. Oklahoma used 100 . milligrams of that drug. 'They should have anticipated possible problems with an untried execution protocol,' Autry said. 'Obviously . the whole thing was gummed up and botched from beginning to end. Halting the execution obviously did Lockett no good.' Republican . Gov. Mary Fallin ordered a 14-day stay of execution for an inmate who . was scheduled to die two hours after Lockett, Charles Warner. She . also ordered the state's Department of Corrections to conduct a 'full . review of Oklahoma's execution procedures to determine what happened and . why during this evening's execution.' Robert . Patton, the department's director, halted Lockett's execution about 20 . minutes after the first drug was administered. He later said there had . been vein failure. The execution began at 6:23 p.m., when officials began administering the first drug, the sedative midazolam. A doctor declared Lockett to be unconscious at 6:33 p.m. Once . an inmate is declared unconscious, the state's execution protocol calls . for the second drug, a paralytic, to be administered. The third drug in the protocol is potassium chloride, which stops the heart. 6.23pm - The injection process begins. Lockett has heavy, slow blinks, laid still . 6.29pm - Consistently closed his eyes . 6.30pm - First check of consciousness; still conscious . 6.33pm - Announced Lockett was officially unconscious . 6.34pm - Lockett started to move his mouth . 6.36pm - Lockett began convulsing and mumbling . 6.37pm - Lockett sat up and said 'something's wrong' 6.39pm - Prison officials lowered the blinds . 7.06pm - Lockett dies of massive heart attack . Patton . said the second and third drugs were being administered when a problem . was noticed. He said it's unclear how much of the drugs made it into the . inmate's system. Lockett began writhing at 6:36. At 6:39, a doctor lifted the sheet that was covering the inmate to examine the injection site. 'There . was some concern at that time that the drugs were not having that . (desired) effect, and the doctor observed the line at that time and . determined the line had blown,' Patton said at a news conference . afterward, referring to Lockett's vein rupturing. After an official lowered the blinds, Patton made a series of phone calls before calling a halt to the execution. 'After . conferring with the warden, and unknown how much drugs went into him, . it was my decision at that time to stop the execution,' Patton told . reporters. Lockett was declared dead at 7:06 p.m. Autry, . Lockett's attorney, was immediately skeptical of the department's . determination the issue was limited to a problem with Lockett's vein. 'I'm . not a medical professional, but Mr. Lockett was not someone who had . compromised veins,' Autry said. 'He was in very good shape. He had large . arms and very prominent veins.' Bailey Elise McBride, who reports for the Associated Press in their Oklahoma bureau, tweeted immediately after the botched execution . 'After weeks of Oklahoma refusing to . disclose basic information about the drugs for tonight's lethal . injection procedures, tonight Clayton Lockett was tortured to death,' said Madeline Cohen, an attorney for Warner. Adam . Leathers, co-chair of the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death . Penalty, accused the state of having 'tortured a human being in an . unconstitutional experimental act of evil,' reported CNN. In . Ohio, the January execution of an inmate who made snorting and gasping . sounds led to a civil rights lawsuit by his family and calls for a . moratorium. Nightmare: Patton said the inmate was writhing on the gurney, pictured, and shaking uncontrollably about 13 minutes into the execution . Tuesday was the first time Oklahoma . used the drug midazolam as the first element in its execution drug . combination. Other states have used it before; Florida administers 500 . milligrams of midazolam as part of its three-drug combination. Oklahoma . used 100 milligrams. The . problems with the execution are likely to fuel more debate about the . ability of states to administer lethal injections that meet the U.S. Constitution's requirement they be neither cruel nor unusual punishment. That question has . drawn renewed attention from defense attorneys and death penalty . opponents in recent months, as several states scrambled to find new . sources of execution drugs because drugmakers that oppose capital . punishment - many based in Europe - have stopped selling to prisons and . corrections departments. Defense . attorneys have unsuccessfully challenged several states' policies of . shielding the identities of the new sources of their execution drugs. Missouri and Texas, like Oklahoma, have both refused to reveal their . sources, but both of those states have since successfully carried out . executions with their new supplies. The state has stood by the execution but said Monday that it's boosting the dosages of its lethal injection drugs. A . four-time felon, Lockett was convicted of shooting 19-year-old . Stephanie Neiman with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two . accomplices buried her alive in rural Kay County in 1999 after Neiman . and a friend arrived at a home the men were robbing. Warner had been scheduled to be put to death two hours later in the same room and on the same gurney. The 46-year-old was convicted of raping and killing his roommate's 11-month-old daughter in 1997. He has maintained his innocence. Lockett . and Warner had sued the state for refusing to disclose details about . the execution drugs, including where Oklahoma obtained them. The . case, filed as a civil matter, placed Oklahoma's two highest courts at . odds and prompted calls for the impeachment of state Supreme Court . justices after the court last week issued a rare stay of execution. The . high court later dissolved its stay and dismissed the inmates' claim . that they were entitled to know the source of the drugs. By . then, Fallin had issued a stay of her own - a one-week delay in . Lockett's execution that resulted in both men being scheduled to die on . the same day. Warner was served a final meal Tuesday of 20 boneless chicken wings, potato wedges, cole slaw, two fruit cocktail cups and a 20-ounce soda. Lockett's request of steak, shrimp, a large baked potato and a Kentucky Bourbon pecan pie was denied because it exceeded the $15 limit. He declined a separate offer from the warden for a dinner from Western Sizzlin', prison officials said. Oklahoma changed its execution protocols twice this year, leaving State officials with five options for lethal injections, including a new three-drug mixture that was used for the first time Tuesday. Two of the drugs used carry warnings that they can suppress the respiratory system and the third warns that cardiac trouble can occur at high but non-lethal doses, and lists specific steps to take if a medical patient receives too much of the drug but doesn't die.","Clayton Lockett execution halted 20 minutes after first drug administered .

"By . Sam Peters . Martin Kaymer does not conform to stereotypes. The German does not drink beer, enjoys a laugh with his Scottish caddie and considers playing golf in England as ‘coming home’. ‘It’s a strange thing for me as a German; I don’t really like beer that much,’ he said. ‘I don’t drink a lot of alcohol. I know I should do as a German but I just don’t like it. I guess that’s a good thing.’ After winning the Players’ Championship in May, Kaymer put in a dominant display to win the US Open at Pinehurst last month by eight shots. Hitting form at the right time: Martin Kaymer celebrates with the US Open trophy after his eight-shot win . Beaming: The German stands in front of the leaderboard at Pinehurt after his stunning victory . He celebrated his Players’ win by having a quiet dinner with Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley and his caddie, Scotsman Craig Connolly, before being spotted the next morning — £1 million richer — sitting on the floor at Dallas Airport playing on his phone while waiting for a delayed flight. Connolly will again be on the bag at Hoylake for the Open this week — where Kaymer, 29, will start among the favourites — after successfully rekindling their partnership following a one-year break which coincided with a slump in form. Perfect conditions: Kaymer hits his tee shot on the ninth hole during his final round at the US Open in June . ‘These days, a lot of golfers are so into themselves, doing their own thing, it’s not often that people laugh,’ said Kaymer. ‘Craig enables me to laugh. He has a great sense of humour and brings a great spirit to the course. Sometimes it’s nice for someone to loosen you up a bit. ‘There’s a balance to find between getting too frustrated if things aren’t going well and not getting too happy in the good times. But it all comes down to experience and knowing how you react in certain situations. ‘Having Craig on the bag helps me achieve that. He’s a very fine caddie but also he’s a nice guy who keeps things in perspective. ‘It’s so important to have respect for each other and keep a distance as well. You can’t get too close. We are doing business together and we both want to be successful. Winner: Kaymer celebrates with his trophy at Pinehurt as the sun sets behind him . ‘I’ve never been to Hoylake and I don’t know the course. But for me, playing the Open always feels like I’m coming home. It’s real golf where you have to feel the course and play with all the conditions. 'Playing the Open is about playing the game of golf. It’s a mental battle and a fight. The fans really know golf. The Open week says so much about golf. It would be amazing to win it one day.’ He blushes at comparisons with Nick Faldo but, with a re-modelled swing, Kaymer is in the process of forging a career every bit as impressive as Europe’s most prolific post-war Major winner. Last month’s US Open triumph confirmed that the former world No 1’s resurgence from a slump was complete. It marked the end of a miserable spell for Kaymer, who struggled to cope with the weight of expectation after winning the 2010 USA PGA and reaching the summit of the world rankings before making the controversial changes he knew he needed to stay at the top. Technique: The German in action at the BMW International Open in Cologne last month . Two years after re-modelling his swing to add a draw as well as a fade, just as Faldo did as a young man, Kaymer is now the complete player. ‘I have a lot of respect for Nick Faldo’s achievements,’ said Kaymer. ‘He had the same ambitions as me in the past when he made his changes to his swing. ‘I could have played the way I was playing for 20 years but I would have always asked myself “what might have been?” ‘People have made the technical alterations I made sound worse and more extreme than they were.

"By . Sam Peters . England captain Alastair Cook buried the hatchet with Shane Warne before receiving a barrage of criticism over his leadership as his side blew yet another golden opportunity on Thursday. India recovered from 145 for seven to 290 for nine on day one of the second Investec Test at Lord’s after being put in to bat by Cook on a pitch perfectly suited to England’s battery of fast bowlers. Cook’s tactics were labelled ‘dreadful’ and ‘unfathomable’ while former England opener Geoffrey Boycott said his side ‘completely lost the plot’ as centurion Ajinkya Rahane helped India add 150 runs in the evening session and England resorted to repeatedly bowling bouncers. It also emerged that Warne, who . described Cook’s captaincy at Headingley against Sri Lanka last month as . ‘the worst I’ve ever seen’, had called the England captain to clear the . air. Under fire: Alastair Cook was slammed by former England stars after burying the hatchet with Shane Warne . Off the hook: India ended the day 290 for 9 after recovering from 145 for seven after being sent in . Big call: Shane Warne sought out Cook's mobile number to arrange a chat about recent criticism . ‘It was all starting to get a bit out of control,’ said Warne. ‘I asked for his number and I texted him to see if we could have five minutes on the phone. We spoke for about an hour about lots of different things. I had my say, he had his say. He told me how he felt and I told him how I felt about certain things. It was good to clear the air and it was amicable. It was just good to speak about stuff other than cricket as well.’ The England bowlers were more to blame for India wriggling off the hook on day one at Lord's but Cook’s captaincy was still criticised by Boycott and former England captains Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss. Boycott said: ‘As a batsman, I start thinking that I’m going to get out if I get four good balls an over. England couldn’t manage that. They could only do it once an over. They then lost the plot when Liam Plunkett went round the wicket and started to bang it in. Cook is not going to make it as a tactical captain - the lads might like him in the dressing room, but not as a tactical captain. Sorry.’ Letting loose: Ajinkya Rahane accelerated in the third session of the day to scored a hundred . Falling short: Alastair Cook (centre) speaks with frontline bowlers Stuart Broad (left) and James Anderson (right) Looking for answers: Cook would have expected to have India bowled out cheaply after sending them in . VIDEO Great feeling to score a centruy at Lord's - Rahane . Strauss added: ‘England have sat back here rather than make things happen. You can go a long way towards winning a game on the first morning at Lord’s but you have to make things happen. I can’t fathom some of the tactics.’ At least it was a good day for Gary Ballance, who was under the spotlight after his drunken, topless antics following the first Test in Nottingham. The Yorkshire batsman eased some of the pressure on him by snaffling two sharp slip catches in the morning session. The ICC have appointed Australian judge Gordon Lewis to hear the code of conduct cases against Jimmy Anderson and Ravi Jadeja following last week’s Trent Bridge Test. There will be a preliminary hearing next Tuesday before a date is set for the final hearing which could see both men banned for part of the series.","Cook won the toss and sent India in to bat first in the second Test .

"By . Sam Peters . While Sam Robson was steadily compiling his first Test hundred for England, his captain Alastair Cook was sat in the changing room pondering where his own next three-figure score will come from. England’s skipper is in a rut. He has not scored a century for England since July last year and his last 23 innings have yielded just 585 runs at an average of 25. After a remarkable start to his reign — which saw him score five hundreds in his first nine Tests in charge — it is hard to escape the conclusion that the burden of captaincy is beginning to affect his batting as it’s affected so many England captains in the past. Out of sorts: Alastair Cook has not scored a hundred for England since July last year and his last 23 innings have yielded just 585 runs at an average of 25 . Cook spoke ahead of this second Investec Test of his desire to silence the constant sniping from the likes of Aussie cheerleader Shane Warne by recording what would be his 26th Test hundred. He had the perfect stage against a limited Sri Lankan attack on a Headingley pitch with few of the demons the visitors perceived on day one. But he added just three runs to his overnight score of 14 before prodding with hard hands at an apparently innocuous delivery from medium pacer Dhammika Prasad, edging a regulation catch to first slip. ‘It’s where he gets out every time,’ said one England fan. He was not far wrong. The big concern for the left-handed opener is that opposition bowlers have, after 104 Tests and 25 hundreds, worked out a method that consistently troubles him. By bowling a full length on or around off-stump and refusing to bowl anything short or on his hips, Cook is being strangled outside off-stump far too often for comfort. He is made of stern stuff, no doubt. And with 8,109 Test runs at 46.07 he has proved himself to be a world-class performer at the top of England’s order. Eyes on the ball: Cook's immediate future is not in doubt, but he needs a big score soon . But being captain is a solitary place when you are not scoring runs and, as well as dealing with the media, tactical and management elements of the job, the 29-year-old must ensure he focuses enough time on his own game to put right his technical wrongs. The last time Cook went through a trough like this was in 2010 against Pakistan when he went on to play a career-defining innings of 110 at the Oval which saved his international career. His immediate future is not in doubt — despite the horror of last winter where he was powerless to stop Australia crushing his side — but he needs a big score soon, if only for his own peace of mind and to enable him to concentrate on the England captaincy, a difficult enough job by itself. He will gain a measure of peace a few days after  this Test when he visits  his wife Alice’s parents farm in Buckinghamshire — where he goes to find mental solace away from the strains of international cricket — and he will no doubt also consult his old friend and mentor Graham Gooch. But while leadership  is a lonely place, so is batting. And Cook knows the only person who can solve his woes at the  crease is staring back at him in the mirror.","Cook has not scored a century for England since July last year and his last 23 innings have yielded just 585 runs at an average of 25 .

"By . Sam Peters . The pain of being ordered to pack his bags and fly home from Australia this winter persists but gradually the scars left by a tortuous year in the international wilderness are fading for Steven Finn. Whisper it, but the 25-year-old is returning to the sort of form that made him one of the most potent young fast bowlers on the planet in his early twenties, only for self-doubt and too much well-meaning advice to scramble his brain and destroy his technique. By the end of the disastrous 5-0 Ashes whitewash, a shell-shocked Finn — the only member of England’s squad not to feature in the series — was deemed ‘unselectable’ by one-day coach Ashley Giles and told to get on the next plane back to England. Class: Finn, seen here bowling for Middlesex, is hoping to improve England's fortunes . Born: Watford . Age: 25 . Height: 6ft7in . County: Middlesex (2005-) Test debut: v Bangladesh (March 2010) Tests: 23 . Runs: 169 . Wickets: 90 . Best bowling: 6-125 v Australia (Brisbane, 2010); v New Zealand (Auckland 2013) ‘Even at the end of the tour I refused to admit that I should have been sent home,’ said Finn, speaking to The Mail on Sunday in his first major interview since the end of the Ashes. ‘I made someone else make the decision for me because I wasn’t willing to walk away from playing cricket for my country. You grow up dreaming of playing cricket for your country and I wasn’t going to throw the towel in on that opportunity unless someone made that decision for me. ‘It was frustrating. It was horrible. Standing at the back of my mark thinking “Where the hell is this going to go?” You lose all sensation of that feeling on the end of your fingertips. You lose it and you can’t find it. At worst, that’s what it was and at best it wasn’t much better.’ Finn’s problems began to surface following complaints by South African batsmen in 2012 that his quirky, if apparently innocuous, habit of accidentally breaking the stumps at the non-striker’s end in his delivery stride was putting them off. It prompted the MCC to take the unusual step of introducing a new playing condition in 2013 which now sees a ‘no-ball’ called whenever it happens. Finn’s attempts to iron out the flaw had disastrous repercussions for the rest of his game and he played the last of his 23 Tests against Australia at Trent Bridge last year, when captain Alastair Cook refused to bowl him on the final day of a closely fought match. ‘People have been doing that [dislodging bails in delivery] for years, so to have a law made up just for me when people like Shaun Pollock had done it for years did seem a bit strange,’ said Finn. ‘It definitely affected my bowling. It made me rethink how I approached the crease, I started bowling wide of the crease, had to change my run-up and I’ve now had to rethink how I approach the crease coming straighter in.’ Tough boss: Ashley Giles made the decision to send Finn home from the awful 5-0 Ashes whitewash . Closer: Finn stands alongside Alastair Cook and Ashley Giles during a nets session in Cardiff last year . Finn strongly denies any suggestion that things got so bad in Australia as to be termed the ‘yips’. But he accepts there were times when he worried about releasing the ball, while his return to England saw him unpick his technique and go ‘back to basics’ with Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson in an attempt to resurrect his stalling career. The pair use a clip of Finn bowling for England Lions in 2010 as a reference point, and both men believe his action is now back to mirroring that which saw him first called up as a 20-year-old capable of consistently touching 90mph.‘When I came back from Australia we literally went back to standing and bowling the ball into a net which was three or four yards away, trying to feel my arms moving like they used to,’ said Finn. ‘When you’ve not done it for so long, it feels so alien. Johnno was behind me saying “It looks really natural” and I’m there going “It doesn’t feel very natural, it feels terrible ... it feels like I can’t let go — not let go — but I can’t get it to where I want it to go”. ‘From the beginning of 2013 through to the beginning of 2014, I was working on things that were detrimental to me being a better bowler. Playing with a short run-up that made everything forced and made me force pace rather than just run in and naturally bowl quick, which I’d always done before that. ‘A lot of what happened knocked on from that, grooved bad habits and got me away from bowling like I had done when I was young. Now, it certainly looks and feels like I’m starting to get back to bowling very naturally like I did when I was a bit younger.’ Fresh faced: Finn celebrates a wicket on his England debut against Bangladesh at Old Trafford in 2010 . Finn’s struggles Down Under led to suggestions of a rift between Middlesex and England bowling coach David Saker. ‘It was nobody else’s fault but my own,’ said Finn. ‘I was the one who made decisions at a stage in my career and I made the wrong ones. ‘None of this is anything to do with David Saker. It’s a player’s responsibility to make sure that your game’s in order. I tried my hardest to make sure that my game was in order in Australia, but it wasn’t. It took me taking a step back to realise what was going wrong to address it.’ And address it he has, judging by recent performances. He is the fourth leading wicket-taker in the County Championship Division One this season with 40 wickets at 28.47 and, perhaps more importantly, Finn looks to be attacking the bowling crease with the sort of gusto that saw him take 46 wickets in his first 11 Tests in his breakthrough year in 2010. Finding his rhythm: Finn celebrates a wicket on Middlesex duty against Northampton . On Thursday, as England’s bowlers were toiling at Trent Bridge, the 6ft 7in quickie — back off his long run — looked fluid and relaxed in giving Somerset’s batsmen the hurry-up on an Uxbridge track admittedly containing more life than Nottingham’s dead dog. ‘As the season’s gone on I’ve felt the rhythm has got better,’ he added. ‘The most important thing is that I feel like I’m bowling well and that’s a feeling that eluded me pretty much all winter and most of last season. I’m back bowling well and I’ve no doubt the wickets will come. ‘What’s happened has happened. It’s in the past. I’m trying to look forward. But it would disappoint me and frustrate me greatly if my best years were when I was 20, 21, 22. ‘Obviously I want to play international cricket again and I think that I’d be ready if I was to get the call to play in a one-day international or a Test match or whatever. ‘But a lot of guys are ahead of me at the moment, and rightly so, so I want to let my bowling do the talking. I might have a few choice words for the batsman every now and again but other than that I don’t want to do any talking.’ Talisman: After an up-and-down career with his country, Finn wants to help England improve .","Finn would step up to bowl and think 'Where the hell  this going to go?'

"By . Sam Peters . Saracens’ Alistair Hargreaves, the man set to replace Steve Borthwick in Saturday’s Heineken Cup final, is preparing for the biggest game of his life. The 18st heavily-bearded former Springbok second row, who played in the same school cricket team as South Africa batsman Hashim Amla, is no household name in England. But the 6ft 7in giant could be by 7pm on Saturday when Saracens will be crowned European champions if they beat Jonny Wilkinson’s star-studded Toulon in Cardiff. Stepping up: Alistair Hargreaves could start in the Heineken Cup final following an injury to Steve Borthwick . School mates: South Africa cricketer Hashim Amla played cricket with Saracens lock Hargreaves . ‘I . try not to let the occasion  overwhelm me and I try to keep my . preparation pretty consistent,’ said the 28-year-old, ‘but if you look . at it, it probably is the biggest game of my life.’ Mark . McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, tried to be positive about . Borthwick’s injury situation yesterday, insisting the former England . captain still had a 50-50 chance of playing after aggravating a pectoral . muscle injury in last Saturday’s Aviva Premiership semi-final win over . Harlequins. But other club . sources hint that the likelihood of the 34-year-old playing at the . Millennium Stadium — or at Twickenham in the Premiership final a week . later — are considerably slimmer. A final call will be made on Thursday. Steve hasn’t trained all week,’ said McCall. ‘If he doesn’t play it would just prove that life’s unfair.’ If . Borthwick does not recover, the likelihood is Hargreaves will partner . fellow South African-born lock Mo Botha in Saracens’ second row as they . seek to lift the Heineken Cup for the first time. Concerns: Saracens captain Steve Borthwick suffered a shoulder injury at Allianz Park on Saturday . ‘We . all owe a duty to Steve,’  Hargreaves said. ‘He is such an important . part of this club and the evolution of this club, but you can never . replace a guy of that calibre directly.’ On . Saturday Hargreaves stepped in for Botha at short notice after the . former England lock had a back spasm in the warm-up. Hargreaves went on . to produce a near-faultless display as Saracens came from behind to . secure a place in the  Premiership final against  Northampton on May 31. The . four-times capped Springbok from Durban, a popular figure at Allianz . Park, is a multi-talented sportsman who could have played cricket for a . living. ‘I was a decent all-rounder,’ said Hargreaves, whose beard is almost a match for that sported by his old chum Amla. ‘I . was at Durban High School which has a proud cricket history and I was . fortunate to play on the same side as Amla because bowling at him in the . nets wasn’t fun. You’d end up chasing leather all afternoon. ‘His . average as a schoolboy was in the 90s and he’s gone on to be . consistently among the best batsmen in the world. He was quiet, humble. Everything you could ask for from a world-class sportsman. Farewell: Captain Borthwick played his last game at Allianz Park with the hard-fought win over Quins . ‘People . rub off on you as you grow up. How you grow up and the people you grow . up with shape you and I’d like to think he has had some influence on my . career, although not directly.’ Hargreaves . is to be married back home in Durban in the middle of June but before . then he faces two games that could define his career, against Toulon and . Northampton — the sides who knocked Saracens out of the two major . tournaments at the semi-final stage last year. ‘I . hope we’ve learnt from last year and we’ll have a couple of new tricks . up our sleeves. The occasion won’t get the better of us like  it . possibly did last year,’ said Hargreaves. He . and his team-mates will fly to Cardiff on Saturday morning — though . goalkickers Owen Farrell and Alex Goode will travel the  previous day by . private jet to  practise under the closed  Millennium Stadium roof. ‘We like our players to sleep in their own beds the night before a game,’ McCall explained. Chris . Ashton will start on the wing for Saracens against Toulon after . receiving a written warning from the RFU for his crass attempt to . distract Quins’ Nick Evans, who was about to kick for goal, by shouting . at him. ‘It’s been dealt with and we move on,’ McCall said.

"By . Sam Peters . Steve Borthwick will hang up his boots on Saturday satisfied he has earned the respect of his team-mates during a 16-year career which has not always seen him embraced by the English public. Borthwick is the most capped player in Aviva Premiership history with 264 appearances. And he has played through the pain of a serious pectoral injury, sustained almost two months ago, to attempt to finish his career with a domestic final victory against Northampton at Twickenham. The former England captain, who represented his country 57 times and was first-choice skipper during much of Martin Johnson’s troubled reign, has never sought public adulation.

As long as they think well of me, that’s all that matters. ‘Other people can think what they like to be honest. ‘I feel content with where I am.

"By . Sam Peters . Chris Ashton's participation in the Heineken Cup final is in doubt after it emerged that his crass attempt to put off Harlequins goal-kicker Nick Evans in Saturday’s Aviva Premiership semi-final is being investigated by the RFU. With the Saracens crowd keeping a respectful silence, Ashton could be clearly heard inside the ground shouting ‘Miss!’ as he attempted to charge down Evans’s conversion of Mike Brown’s try on the stroke of half-time. His actions sparked a melee in the tunnel as incensed Harlequins players - including Ashton’s England team-mates Brown, Joe Marler and Danny Care - confronted the Saracens winger to let him know what they thought of his behaviour. Wrong: Chris Ashton attempted to putt off Harlequins goal-kicker Nick Evans . Controversial moment: Ashton's Heineken Cup final participation is now in doubt . Referee Wayne Barnes, who had earlier sent two Saracens players - Marcelo Bosch and Matt Stevens - to the sin bin, chose not to penalise Ashton despite the angry exchanges which continued down the tunnel. The RFU decided against citing the player but Sportsmail has learned that the RFU’s head of discipline, Gerard McEvilly, is investigating the  incident and Ashton could yet face a misconduct charge. In the worst-case scenario, he could receive a ban although it is understood a written warning is the most likely sanction. Whatever the outcome, the incident will not have gone unnoticed by England head coach Stuart Lancaster as he considers his tour party for New Zealand. Ashton, who has 37 caps, was left out of England’s 6 Nations squad but with Exeter winger Jack Nowell recently having knee and shoulder surgery, he is in contention for a recall following his exceptional recent form. ‘Humility and honesty are  written up on the walls around the stadium,’ said an unimpressed Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea after the game. ‘It (Ashton’s shout) wasn’t something you’d expect someone to do but we’ll leave it.’ Ashton went on to score a try as Saracens overhauled a 17-11 half-time deficit with a commanding second-half display which saw Mark McCall’s men score 20 unanswered points to power their way into a final against Northampton and give themselves hope of an historic domestic and European double. Powerful: A breakdown of how the Saracens have racked up their tries since 2010 . Turnaround: Ashton is back in contention for an England call-up after his impressive form of late .

"By . Sam Peters . Stuart Lancaster hesitated when asked if Danny Cipriani’s first  England call-up in almost six years is a risk. His short answer was ‘no’ but his extended message to the gifted Sale maverick — exiled from international rugby since 2008 after testing the patience of Martin Johnson once too often — was that the fly-half will be watched carefully when he arrives as part of an initial 20-man squad for a training camp on Sunday. England’s head coach has invested too much into improving his squad’s behaviour to allow one player, albeit one as prodigiously talented as Cipriani, to threaten their new and improved culture. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Stuart Lancaster's views on Danny Cipriani's England recall . Finding his way: Danny Cipriani's return to form has earned him a recall to the England squad . Ready to grasp his opportunity: Cipriani insists he will take his chance with both hands . ‘I don’t view it as a risk,’ said Lancaster. ‘It is an opportunity. Ultimately, selection will be affected by how effective Danny is off the field in a training environment and his ability to apply his skills to our game plan. ‘If he’s good enough he’ll get the opportunity to go to New Zealand and if he’s not quite ready he’ll hopefully play in the Barbarians game (at Twickenham on June 1) as the beginning of his return to international rugby. ‘I’ve spoken to him in part (about team culture) but there will be a lot more when he comes into camp. I’ll arrange a one-on-one with every player. Danny’s might be a little bit longer. But of course he can train his way on to the plane. All the players can.’ Cipriani’s inclusion by no means guarantees him a place on the tour. He remains behind Saracens’ Owen Farrell, Bath’s George Ford and Northampton’s Stephen Myler in the pecking order. Low risk: England head coach Stuart Lancaster says including Cipriani in his 20-man squad is not a gamble . But it is reward for consistent excellence for Sale this season and  working with Jonny Wilkinson’s former mentor Steve Black to improve his off-field behaviour — last season’s drunken run-in with a double decker bus was the last in a litany of misdemeanours. With Myler and Farrell likely to be involved in the Aviva Premiership final on May 31 and therefore forced to miss the opening Test in Auckland on June 7, there is every chance the most talented English player of his generation could win a long overdue eighth cap. ‘I’ve taken a lot of feedback from the coaching team at Sale and Steve Diamond and Brian Redpath are good judges of character and talent,’ added Lancaster. ‘I spoke to Danny ahead of the Six Nations and gave him some areas to work on and he’s gone away and done that. Recall: Cipriani has not featured on the international stage since 2008 . ‘I’m persuaded to give him an opportunity. As with all players I will judge him on when they come into camp and how they behave when they’re in it. ‘You have to earn the right — and I think Johnno was the same — by playing well for your club and behaving on and off the field. ‘Perhaps at that time that  wasn’t the case but I think it is now, so we have created this opportunity.’ Lancaster will name the final squad for the three-Test tour on Monday week. There was positive news about Billy Twelvetrees’ ankle yesterday but England are sure to be shorn of several key players. Speaking out: Tom Wood reckons it is 'ridiculous' England are taking on New Zealand without all of their stars . It is hard not to feel sympathy for the head coach, who played no part in the fixture scheduling —described by England flanker Tom Wood as ‘ridiculous’ — which leaves the winners of this  weekend’s Premiership semi-finals knowing they will have played themselves out of the tour. ‘It’s hard to disagree with Tom and the way he articulated it,’ said Lancaster. ‘He, alongside everyone else, is frustrated by the situation. We get very few opportunities to go to a country like New Zealand and play against them and you want to go with you best side.’ Whether Cipriani is part of that group remains to be seen.","Sale Sharks star has been included in England's initial 20-man squad .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . India have become used to getting their own way in the world game and think nothing of riding roughshod over both the rules and the ineffectual International Cricket Council. Yet on Friday a supposed hardline former Australian judge delivered a verdict that was the equivalent of a massive innings defeat for them. Gordon Lewis, appointed by the ICC to oversee a case which should never have needed the involvement of a judicial commissioner and lawyers, took one look at six hours worth of evidence and instantly decided that Jimmy Anderson had no case to answer. What a nonsense. What a total farce. What an absolute waste of money. Common sense prevails: James Anderson has been cleared lf physically assaulting Ravindra Jedeja (R) Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch . Delight: Anderson cannot hide his emotions after dismissing Jadeja at the Ageas Bowl . Yet in a development which left India both stunned and angry the judicial commissioner quickly decided there was no case to answer for either player. It was India who insisted on bringing a highly unusual Level Three charge against Anderson for ‘abusing and pushing’ Jadeja which left him facing a four-Test suspension and expulsion for the rest of a series that England levelled in convincing fashion on Thursday. They were adamant that Anderson had crossed a line in making physical contact with Jadeja after the players had left the outfield at lunch on the second day of the first Test, raising the stakes and forcing both sides to bring in lawyers. Yet England’s belief that India’s provocative move was purely tactical to get their best bowler thrown out of the series was backed up by Lewis’s decision to clear Anderson and uphold India’s appeal against a fine levelled against Jadeja. Leader of the attack: Anderson was man of the match in England's third Test win at the Ageas Bowl . For fourth Test vs India at Old Trafford, starting on August 7 . Cook (c), Ali, Anderson, Ballance,  Bell,  Broad, Buttler (wkt), Jordan, Plunkett, Robson,  Root, Stokes, Woakes. Matt Prior, Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes, the England players closest to the incident, were the main witnesses for Anderson while India coach Duncan Fletcher, captain MS Dhoni and physio Evan Speechly were in Jadeja’s corner. Anderson, man of the match in England’s 266-run victory at the Ageas Bowl, was said to be euphoric after having the potentially serious stain on his record which has been hanging over him during the last two Tests removed. Now, in a huge psychological boost, Anderson will be free to play at his home ground of Old Trafford in next week’s fourth Test after what England will consider almost as big a victory as the one they gained on the field in Southampton over the last week.

His Honour Gordon Lewis AM is Australia’s representative on the ICC’s Code of Conduct commission.

'The whole Test, he's been great. But the spell he bowled on the last morning was a real masterclass of swing bowling. '(It was) on a pitch that was drying, had something in it - but his control of line, length and the decisions he made to put batsmen under pressure was outstanding.'","James Anderson was found not guilty of Level Three offence by ICC .

England are perfectly placed to end close to a year of abject misery by finishing off a job they have started with four highly impressive days at the Ageas Bowl and level this Investec series with victory in the third Test. A win that would be absolutely priceless for England will be sealed if they can take the remaining six Indian wickets and complete what has been up to now one of the most important and satisfying performances of Alastair Cook’s career. One of the most successful England teams in modern memory have completely and spectacularly unravelled since that golden afternoon in Durham almost 12 months ago when Stuart Broad propelled them to a decisive 3-0 Ashes lead.

Superb catch: Chris Jordan (front) dives to his right to spectacularly snare Cheteshwar Pujara (top) VIDEO We're really hungry for a win - Root . This is the 11th Test since then and only the core of Cook, Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Ian Bell and Joe Root are still standing amid the rubble of a return Ashes whitewash, much blood-letting and setbacks against Sri Lanka and India. That long winless run culminated with an absolute horror show on the final day of the second Test at Lord’s when the very future of a ‘new’ England side under Cook was placed in jeopardy before it even had time to sprout roots. If Lord’s was rock bottom then Southampton is assuredly the start of the long climb back, with both, crucially, those senior players and the many promising newcomers combining here to provide a display full of character and purpose. Wednesday was the perfect example of how England have dug deep in those few days since they self-destructed at Lord’s. Firstly there was Anderson, back to his absolute best, quickly taking the last two Indian first innings wickets to complete his 16th five-wicket Test haul on his 32nd birthday. Then Cook, whose captaincy was very much on the line ahead of this game, was at the heart of a perfectly paced England second innings which saw them score 205 for four in 40.4 overs, 125 of them coming in 19.5 overs after lunch which allowed Cook the luxury of a declaration ahead of tea. Turning it on: Moeen Ali (right) celebrates with Root (left) after getting Cheteshwar Pujara . The edge of reason: The bails are off and England appeal successfully for the run out of Murali Vijay (second right) Athleticism: Jos Buttler dives to take the ball as Kohli watches on . Cook’s unbeaten 70, compiled with the minimum of fuss typical when he is on top of his game, was complemented by rapid selfless contributions from Gary Ballance, Bell and, most impressively, Root, who hit 56 in 41 balls. It was the fall of Root that led to Cook calling a halt with India needing a world record 445 to win but with England having a full 130 overs to get them out again, with not even his most vociferous critics feeling he had gone on too long. There was much work for England still to do and when Anderson and Broad failed to make a breakthrough in the first 10 overs a team who have forgotten how to win could have thought back to Sri Lanka and let their heads drop. Yet an inspired piece of fielding from Broad and the equally inspired decision by Cook to bring on Moeen Ali as early as the 12th over changed the course of the Indian innings, this Test and, perhaps, the series. It is easy to forget that England were expected to rest Broad here, with his right knee injury becoming acute, but he was determined to play and, characteristically, has thrown himself into this Test, not least when the Indian openers tried to take a quick single to him just after the end of his first spell. Appealing habit: James Anderson implores the umpire to give a decision, without success . Scoop! Joe Root gets down on one knee and diverts the ball over keeper and slips . Reversal of fortune: A confident Ian Bell reverse sweeps Ravi Jadeja as England look to pile on the runs . Continuing his recovery: Alastair Cook raises his bat after reaching 50 in England's second innings . Broad, virtually on one leg, collected the ball at short mid-wicket, dived and under-armed a throw that registered a direct hit with Murali Vijay fractionally out of his ground. Duncan Fletcher, who always wanted England’s batsmen to dive in such circumstances when he was their coach, would have been fuming. Then Cook, at last showing confidence in Moeen, threw the off-spinner the ball for the 12th over and was immediately rewarded. It always seemed likely that many of the doubts over Cook’s captaincy would be eased once he started scoring runs again and now, all of a sudden, neither his field placings nor bowling changes appeared in question. Most significant of all was his faith in Moeen, who is starting to look more and more like a ‘specialist’ slow bowler at this level rather than the part-timer that Cook and Peter Moores insisted he was at the start of summer. Firstly Moeen had Cheteshwar Pujara brilliantly caught by Chris Jordan at slip off his second ball and later he returned to have Virat Kohli well caught by Jos Buttler. Remarkably, Moeen now has 11 wickets in this series. Sweeping statement: Ballance joined captain Cook and showed his intent . Over the top: Gary Ballance launches Rohit Sharma back over his head for six . Driving force: Sam Robson plays a positive shot - before nicking off again soon after . In between times Cook had taken off Moeen and brought on Root, a decision that seemed questionable until Root had Shikhar Dhawan caught by Jordan. It was a particularly enjoyable wicket for England, who had seen Dhawan survive 13 runs earlier despite being trapped absolutely plumb in front by Moeen. It could have been even better for England had Anderson held on to a sharp caught and bowled chance offered by Rohit Sharma but India, at 112 for four, will need close to a miracle to leave here tonight with their 1-0 lead intact or even enhanced. The sight of Anderson being warned by the umpires for aiming verbals at Ajinkya Rahane as he left the field was a reminder that he is facing a suspension tomorrow when he comes up in front of Australian beak Gordon Lewis. It would be a huge blow for England if they are without their attack leader on his home ground of Old Trafford next week but if Anderson can help wrap up victory today it would make that particular setback a little easier to accept.

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Storm clouds gathered around Lord’s as gloom enveloped Alastair Cook and an England side who will surely crash to defeat in a second Test the captain could not afford to lose. Not even the rain that lashed much of London could save Cook as Lord’s remained stubbornly dry but dark and threatening, a reflection of the mood that has taken hold of the England captain and his developing side. Cook battled so hard to reach 22 off 93 balls and hand England a tantalising glimpse of a successful pursuit of 319 to win this crucial match before he fell in what has become a grimly predictable fashion outside off stump.

It left England, who were looking good at 70 for one, in tatters at 72 for four and Cook with the agonising task of deciding whether he can carry on at the helm of a team in transition he was told to rebuild in his own image. What a pickle England will be in if an India team who have not won abroad for three years go on to take the last six wickets and claim a 1-0 lead with three to play in this Investec series. India have won just one of their 16 Tests at Lord’s before now and only five Tests anywhere in England, a reflection of the travel sickness that should have made them perfect opponents for the ‘new’ England. That is how bad defeat here would be but there remains no appetite within the ECB nor among his team for Cook to stand down now. Not after England have invested so much in him in the wake of an Australian disaster that claimed so many high-profile English casualties. The ECB believe that Cook and Peter . Moores are creating the culture and environment for young players to . flourish they wanted post-Ashes and that it is the senior men who are . letting the captain down at the worst possible time. Only . if Cook falls on his sword ahead of next Sunday’s third Test will there . be a sad end to his captaincy now and even if he is inclined to do that . there will be influential voices who will urge him to fight on. No-one . at Lord’s would have believed at the start of this season that England . would lose in all formats to Sri Lanka and then go one down to India, . with the captain extending his long run without a century to 27 innings. Yet . that will be the sorry scenario unless Joe Root and Moeen Ali . extend their unbeaten partnership of 32 to the point where the second . highest successful run chase in England’s history once again comes into . view.

Bad day: Liam Plunkett sums up England's feelings on day four of the second test . Rare celebration: Ben Stokes gets India's Ravindra Jadeja out for 68 during the second test at Lord's . It is conceivable, with England batting so far down, that they could yet score the 214 runs they still need but this is a team who have forgotten how to win, an England side enduring a run as bad as any suffered in the last 21 years. Even if Cook and England stand firm and battle on they will still have to accept that this would be the most horrible, embarrassing defeat in conditions that were tailor-made for them once they had won a crucial toss. England could justifiably claim that their groundsmen, who had provided subcontinental pitches this summer before now, were doing nothing to help them but Mick Hunt gave them the perfect stage here to finally flourish. This indeed has been close to the perfect Test pitch, with help for the seamers on day one, then decent if challenging batting conditions before spin started to play its part on day four. It is a model every ground should follow. But that simply exacerbates England’s misery. They did not bowl well enough again on Sunday as India, 145 ahead overnight, were able to move into a position where they would become hot favourites in a compelling Test. Delighted: England captain Cook looks happy at catching out India's Stuart Binny . There was hope for England when they took two wickets for one run just ahead of the new ball but once again they allowed the tail to wag vigorously, a stand of 99 for the eighth wicket between Ravindra Jadeja and Bhuvneshwar Kumar leaving the wheels well and truly off England’s wagon. How painful for England that their tormentor should be Jadeja, the man at the centre of the incident at Trent Bridge that leaves Jimmy Anderson facing a suspension when a preliminary hearing begins via Skype on Tuesday. The combative all-rounder signalled his intention to attack from the off, and could easily have holed out to Moeen, who was again under-used by Cook, before he settled in to smash 68 from 57 balls that should prove decisive. Alongside him again was Kumar, who should have been caught by Root on two, a hugely costly miss, but who then went on to score his third half-century of the series from No 9 to add to his six-wicket first-innings haul. High expectations: England failed to impress home crowd at a packed Lord's on day four of the second test . Anderson and Broad, in particular, could . do little to stem the flow, 66 runs coming in 10 overs after lunch, and . it would be no surprise if Broad’s badly hurting knee stops him playing . at the Ageas Bowl. He is woefully short of his best. It was Jadeja, struck on the helmet by Anderson when he batted, who was again a thorn in England’s side with the ball, trapping Sam Robson on the front foot with his first ball to gain a correct decision that never would have been given before the decision-review system. Cook and Gary Ballance steadied the ship, helped by some bizarre captaincy from MS Dhoni, until England’s house came tumbling down with those three quick wickets, the captain trudging off to a sympathetic reception from MCC members that is a reflection of the affection he still commands. The question now is whether that is enough for Cook to ride a storm far greater than the thunder and lightning that rumbled around the home of cricket but refused to come to England’s rescue.

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Alastair Cook was left clinging to the England captaincy by his fingertips on Friday as a leading member of the emerging group beginning to blossom under him dragged his team back into a second Test they are doing their best to throw away. It is not without irony that the latest failure of a captain who is now close to his tipping point should come on a second day at Lord’s when Gary Ballance demonstrated again there is considerable potential in England’s ‘new era’. The big question is whether Cook will decide that promise would be better fulfilled without him at the helm - there is no chance of him being sacked - if India turn their position of superiority here into their first win in 16 overseas Tests. VIDEO Scroll down to watch century-scoring Gary Ballance discuss drunken night out . The nightmare continues: Alastair Cook was dismissed for just 10 . Head down: Cook walks back into the pavilion after being dismissed for 10 . Cook is running out of chances to show . that his attempt to prove he is the best man to move England forward is . not undermining the batting that made him his country’s leading . century-maker. Cook’s swish . of his bat, after he was trapped on his crease and offered MS Dhoni a . catch with just 10 to his name, betrayed the  feelings of a man who has . now gone 26 innings without adding the 26th hundred of his Test career. Lord’s, . with a green pitch made to order by England, should have been the . perfect stage for the captain to get back on course by attacking India . with the ball and then cashing in with the bat when conditions eased . under the baking sun. Yet the fact Cook managed neither leaves him with . much to ponder even if a superb century from  Ballance, who has not . enjoyed the best of weeks himself, at least delayed England being hoist . by their own very green petard for a while yet. That . England are still waiting for their first Test win since the  halcyon . days of last summer has little to do with the introduction of the . cluster of newcomers who have largely taken to Test cricket like ducks . to water.

Instead it is the . ‘spine’ of senior players, charged by England with providing the . backbone and right example to the inexperienced group, who are mainly . responsible for the failures that have left the captain on the brink. Cook . is the man under extreme pressure for his job but his life could have . been made so much easier had Matt Prior, Ian Bell and, in this game at . least, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson made more of an impression for . England. Anderson at least . ended up with four wickets in India’s 295, even though  he bowled poorly . for much of Thursday, while Broad seems to be feeling the effects of . his knee injury that will surely require  surgery sooner or later. Prior . appears to be on his last legs as a keeper, while another soft . dismissal for Bell in England’s  miserable 219 for six on day two, still . 74 behind, showed he is struggling to accept responsibility as . England’s senior middle-order man. It . will take a huge effort from Prior and the tail now to earn a lead . after India, with four wickets for Bhuvneshwar Kumar (right), outbowled .

It was a . display of character from Ballance, who was embarrassed on Wednesday by . the emergence of pictures showing him topless  and the worse for wear . in a Nottingham nightclub at the end of the first Test. He . could have sunk into his shell but snaffled two good catches on the . first morning and then batted in a mature manner that  provided further . evidence of his suitability to step into the big shoes left by Jonathan . Trott. It was a contentious . call by Peter Moores to ask Ballance rather than Bell or Joe Root to bat . at three this season, but with centuries here at Lord’s against both . Sri Lanka and now India he seems assured of a long top-level career. If . only Ballance, missed by Dhoni on 32, could have survived to the close .

England . do not have a history of sacking captains, with only Kevin Pietersen . being pushed rather than jumping himself since Alec Stewart was harshly . dismissed after the 1999 World Cup debacle. Not least among the problems is a lack of viable alternatives to Cook. There . is no way Bell, the unofficial deputy, is an England captain while .

Accomplishment: Anderson hit his first ever Test half-century as England batted themselves back into contention . ‘There were only certain balls that could get me out and I didn’t think the short ball would be dangerous because it was so slow and you could stand up and play it,’ he added. ‘We just had a gameplan and stuck to it.’ Anderson, who fell 19 runs short of becoming the first No11 to score a Test hundred, had never reached 50 in any form of cricket but said wryly that he would reserve judgment on whether his unbeaten 49 for Burnley against Todmorden 13 years ago was still his most significant innings. ‘That was a match-winning 49 not out so we’ll wait and see tomorrow if this trumps it,’ said Anderson. ‘Of course, to build a partnership like that with Joe is a brilliant feeling and we enjoyed every minute of it. ‘We knew this morning we had a job to do and we just wanted to eat into as much time as possible while chipping away at their lead and see where we ended up. We didn’t expect to get as far as we did but we’re delighted. 'I thought we had a really good plan and when we came together on Friday he was taking most of the strike. Today we did the same thing and once I’d got myself in we started rotating it more regularly and then obviously got in front. I thought we did it really well. Slashed: Anderson played a fine array of shots on his way to a total of 81 . Game changer: Joe Root's unbeaten 154 turned the match in England's favour though they were unable to turn the screw further with the ball later on . 'There were a couple of mix-ups where I set off for a run and got sent back, but I thought on the whole we did it well. ‘Joe is a young lad but he did that with great experience. He talked me through every ball of my innings and I talked him through most of his as well. I’m disappointed not to get a hundred. 'I probably should have left that one that got me out but I gave it the kitchen sink and got an edge. Joe got all the luck today because he played and missed four or five times. I would imagine that’s as good as it will get for me. You never know but I don’t think I’ll ever surpass that.’ Anderson, who scored his 81 off 130 balls, had suffered heartache at Headingley where he faced 55 balls without scoring in England’s excruciating loss to Sri Lanka and he admitted he wasn’t sure how to celebrate his landmark. ‘Joe came down the wicket and said milk it,’ said Anderson. ‘I didn’t know what that meant so I just did the round with the bat. I’ve seen people point at the dressing room so I did that, too. ‘I’ve had to do certain jobs for the team. It was disappointing at Headingley but it makes you cherish moments like these even more.’","Anderson and Root set world record for last wicket partnership of 198 .

Captain Alastair Cook suffered further humiliation at Headingley yesterday as England fell towards their first-ever home Test series defeat by Sri Lanka. Cook’s position as captain will surely come under intense pressure after England allowed the tourists to set a daunting target of 350 with some woeful bowling. Cook was then out playing on to his own wicket when his side desperately needed him to contribute a big score. England ended day four on a humiliating 57-5. The prospect of a damaging series loss comes after Cook’s winter of despair in Australia featuring the 5-0 Ashes whitewash under his leadership. Humiliated: Alastair Cook captained England to towards their first ever Test series defeat to Sri Lanka . Under pressure! Alastair Cook could be in danger of losing captaincy after dismal run including Ashes whitewash . Senior batsman Ian Bell attempted to back Cook as captain but former Test great Geoffrey Boycott said on the BBC: ‘The captain is in terrible form. It is a recipe for resignation. I don’t know if he will but it is.’ With England only five wickets away from losing a match which had been theirs for the taking on Saturday afternoon, the man most likely to replace Cook in case of a sacking or resignation insisted he was still the right man for the job. ‘I’m sure he’s pretty disappointed, as we all are’ said Bell. ‘He’s got more hundreds than anyone in an England shirt and he’s one of the best batsmen I’ve ever played with. One innings and he’ll be flying again. But as a group we’ve got to help him. We’ve got to get right behind him and start performing as a team.’ Asked whether he thought Cook still had the desire to carry on, Bell replied: ‘Absolutely. No doubt.’ On a day when Boycott branded England ‘rubbish’ and ‘pathetic’  and a small section of the crowd booed them off at tea, Bell conceded that the defensive fields set for Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews — who made a world-class 160 — hadn’t worked. He said: ‘If you want to stop someone like that scoring runs, you get them out, don’t you? You don’t stop them scoring runs. But we didn’t take our chances.’ Shooting from the lip! Geoff Boycott (L), pictured with Shane Warne (C) and Michael Vaughan, branded England 'rubbish and pathetic' Support act: Ian Bell (L) backed Alastair Cook, saying he still has the hunger to succeed . Sri Lanka veteran Mahela Jayawardene said he felt some sympathy for England’s captain, but he was obviously revelling in Cook’s discomfort. ‘I feel for him, but it doesn’t help when you have arguments with commentators and past cricketers,’ he said. ‘That’s something you can’t control.  ‘Under pressure England are not quite up to it. There are young guys in their side and they will get some tomorrow morning.’ ‘We were telling a couple of their batsmen that their idea of hurting us by hitting us on the head probably doesn’t work. And their field setting showed they were worried. They were quite chirpy at first, but quieter after first hour or so.’ Running scared: Mahela Jayawardene claims England's field settings told Sri Lanka they were worried .","Alastair Cook captained England towards first ever Test defeat to Sri Lanka .

Alastair Cook’s summer of reckoning as England captain begins in earnest at Lord’s on Thursday when he leads a side containing three debutants into what his opposite number says will be a hostile encounter against Sri Lanka. All eyes will be on Cook as he attempts to show he has the captaincy skills to ease the winter misery by overcoming a team still indignant at what they see as English slurs on the legitimacy of spinner Sachithra Senanayake’s bowling action. The controversial run-out of Jos Buttler, when backing up, by Senanayake in the final one-day international was still on the agenda on Wednesday. Angelo Mathews, the Sri Lanka captain, sought to justify his side’s ‘Mankading’ of Buttler by saying that Senanayake’s action had only ever been reported in England. New start: Alastair Cook (right) talks to his new opening partner, debutant Sam Robson (left) The heat is on: Cook prepares in the nets at Lord's where a new era under his captaincy begins on Thursday . Tough cricket: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews (right) has predicted a fiery series against England . ‘Everything started with the reporting of Sachithra,’ said  Mathews. ‘When people find a bowler difficult to handle they tend to report him. We all know it’s going to be a hostile series but we’re up for the challenge.’ It means both sides still feel hard done by - Cook said the ‘Mankading’ was ‘still  frustrating’ - as they approach an Investec series in which England will need to regain the faith of a public who might accept an ODI series loss to Sri Lanka but not one in Test cricket. Without question there will be extra pressure on Cook, even though that might seem harsh after all he has achieved as a  batsman and as a captain in  winning in India and at home against Australia last summer. Yet there is no doubt that Cook retains the full support of the England management, the ECB and his players. All he has to do is repay that faith. ‘It feels like a fresh start, it feels good,’ said Cook in the Lord’s sunshine. ‘I’ve got on really well with Peter Moores since he came back and it has been good to have Paul Farbrace with us. We’ve had two great days here in the build-up to this series and hopefully  people will be ready to go.’ Moving up: Gary Ballance, who will bat at No 3 in the first Test, gets poised to take a catch during practice . Much has been made of the need for England to play positively and with aggression and, on a pitch which looks as green as the  outfield, Cook’s plan is to hit Sri Lanka hard with a four-man seam attack that seems sure to include the returning Liam Plunkett. Comeback: Liam Plunkett is poised to return as part of a four-pronged seam attack against Sri Lanka . Yet if Cook’s critics are expecting a transformation in his captaincy style, they may be disappointed. He would be foolish to try to be a chameleon and attempt ‘funky’ field placings and bowling changes as Michael Clarke does. Cook’s strengths are leading from the front and man-management. The best way for him to energise England is by scoring his first Test century in more than a year and allowing the newcomers - his opening partner Sam Robson, Moeen Ali and a virtual newcomer in Gary Ballance, who will bat at No 3 in this first Test ahead of Ian Bell and Joe Root - time to bed in to their new environment. Two players who will not be at Lord’s, Buttler and Ben Stokes, have commanded almost as much attention as those who will take on Sri Lanka in this first of two Tests, but Cook was adamant England have got their selection right. Stokes was the one glimmer of hope to emerge from the Ashes but England feel he has not played enough cricket after the self-inflicted blow of breaking a wrist when punching a locker out of frustration in the Caribbean. ‘He wasn’t quite ready,’ said Cook. ‘He’s only bowled 30-odd overs and has been a bit rusty, going for four-and-a-half or five an over. It’s a big ask to come back quickly from an injury like that.’ Steam in: Chris Jordan is another set to debut in England's attack after impressing in limited overs formats . Someone who plays despite not having much cricket is Matt Prior, another under extra pressure after being left out following England’s Ashes-losing defeat in Perth. He returns after just one first-class match as a wicketkeeper with Sussex because of his chronic achilles problem. ‘He has been picked because of his long-term record as an England player,’ said Cook. ‘He has a wealth of experience in a side that is changing. He’s a proven international whereas Ben Stokes isn’t quite there yet. Matt has a lot more to offer. I’m backing his ability and we should support him.’ It was good to hear Cook backing Prior. The captain had a big say in the appointment of Moores, the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and clearly now the personnel he wants alongside him at Lord’s. That is how it should be. England's line-up: (back row) Gary Ballance, Moeen Ali, Liam Plunkett, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan and Sam Robson. (Front row) James Anderson, Matt Prior, captain Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell and Joe Root . Start: 11am at Lord’s.

Match referee: Andy Pycroft (Zimbabwe). Weather: Bathed in sun on Wednesday and expected to be kind for first three days. Pitch watch: Alastair Cook says it’s the greenest he has ever seen it. England want as much pace, movement and bounce as possible. If England fail this summer Cook will not have anything to complain about, yet with so many new faces and Plunkett playing his first Test in seven years, it would be unrealistic to expect them to hit the ground sprinting. This is the first time they will have fielded three debutants since, well, their last Test, and the identities of two of those who played in Sydney, Boyd Rankin and Scott Borthwick, proves not all newcomers adapt quickly. Ballance, who was the third debutant at the SCG, Robson, Moeen and Chris Jordan all have the ability to enjoy long England careers but, for now, they will need as much help as possible from the senior spine - in particular the captain.

Level 3 penalty . All . Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of between four and eight Suspension . Points. Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, . depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended . player. The deep wounds inflicted by the nightmare tour of Australia and the bitter aftermath of the Kevin Pietersen affair had begun to heal. Yet no-one was considering the chances of England ending their winless run against India yesterday. All attention was focused on a senior player accused of a physical assault on an opponent, and a junior one who embarrassed himself in a Nottingham nightclub four days before one of the biggest games of his career. Pictures of a drunk Gary Ballance will do little to improve the image of a national side looking to win back the affections of a disillusioned  public, even if England insist he had been given a night off and there was no impropriety. More worrying was the prospect of their best bowler being suspended at a time when they desperately need a victory, any victory, to end the  gloom created by the worst tour in England’s history and a run of nine Tests without a win. Physical contact is the great taboo of cricket, the ‘crime’ that players are forbidden to commit on the field, however heated the verbal exchanges. And it is the extent of the contact between Jimmy Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja in the narrow staircase in the Trent Bridge pavilion at lunch on the second day of the first Test that lies at the heart of an escalating and nasty dispute. Make no mistake, this is serious. Level Three charges are rare in international cricket and the game has not seen one for six years, since India’s Harbhajan Singh was accused of making a racist comment to Australia’s Andrew Symonds. Verbals: Anderson and Jadeja have a frank exchange of views out in the middle on day two . Tension: James Anderson waits to talk to Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni at they walk off for lunch . Jubilant Jimmy: Anderson (centre) celebrates dismissing Ravindra Jadeja during the first Test . VIDEO England 'surprise' at Anderson charge . Jellybeangate: Zaheer Khan (centre) gestures to the ground where he said the sweets were in 2007 . No England player has faced an accusation . as serious as this under the International Cricket Council’s code of . conduct. Anderson, who faces a four-match ban, is said to be  bemused . and hurt by the accusation. Yet it is a charge that India, and . specifically their captain MS Dhoni, are insisting on which has led to a . near breakdown in relations between the teams. It is what happened . in those moments when Anderson clashed with Jadeja and Dhoni as both . teams entered the famous old pavilion and prepared to turn right, at the . bottleneck where one staircase leads to both dressing rooms, that will . determine the extent of Anderson’s punishment. Dhoni has driven this . charge, despite the efforts of the ICC and senior officials from both . nations to broker peace, and as the most powerful man in Indian and . world cricket, what Dhoni says goes. England’s retaliation was . confirmed last night when a Level Two charge was brought on Jadeja — . England don’t want to fall into the trap of backing long bans for both . players — with the India spinner accused of ‘turning suddenly and taking . steps towards Anderson in an aggressive and threatening manner’. It . was  certainly more sudden turn than Jadeja managed with his innocuous . spin bowling at Trent Bridge. So what happened? England insist Jadeja . was the aggressor as the players, in single file, prepared to climb the . rickety Trent Bridge staircase, moving aggressively towards Anderson . after a verbal on-field clash.

Squaring up: Joe Root (right) and Ishant Sharma were involved in a confrontation during the first Test . Making his point: Joe Root (right) and Ishant Sharma continue to argue during the first Test . India view things differently and . consider Anderson guilty of breaking that taboo by ‘pushing and abusing’ Jadeja. Or are they, as Alastair Cook suggested, playing a tactical . game to rid this series of England’s most important bowler? Nobody . doubts physical contact took place. It is what Anderson (below) did to . get Jadeja ‘out of his space’ that will determine, initially in a . preliminary hearing on Tuesday,  the extent of any punishment. Both . sides claim to have witnesses and Sportsmail understands that several . stewards will give evidence for England. It is their word and that of . India’s witnesses, who include reserves Ishwar Pandey and Pankaj Singh, . that the ICC’s judicial commissioner must consider. Most players have . taken the ‘Arsene Wenger’ approach, as Cook put it, and claim to have . seen nothing. India were quick to act, making a complaint to the ICC the . very next day. An ICC lawyer then flew to England and spoke to both . sides in a vain attempt to resolve the matter. ECB chairman Giles Clarke could do nothing to dissuade Dhoni from his confrontational path. Yet . it must be pertinent that the clash happened out of the public eye. If . the players had come together on the field there could be no doubt what . happened. But the wider public must wonder why it could not have been . resolved in private. Peter Moores must wonder what on earth he has . taken on returning as England coach. He was last night reminding . Ballance and other  England players who went out on Sunday night, . including Anderson, of their responsibilities. But it is the prospect of losing Anderson that will concern him most and which will lead to a tense atmosphere at Lord’s.

Alastair Cook will return from injury on Wednesday with one of his senior lieutenants vowing to provide more help to prevent England’s honeymoon period under new management coming to an abrupt halt. Jimmy Anderson believes England’s experienced players let their captain down badly during the winter and wants them to take more responsibility to ensure that Sunday’s crushing defeat by Sri Lanka in Durham is not repeated on Wednesday at Old Trafford. Cook came through a full training session on Tuesday and looks sure to return to a team who crashed to their heaviest defeat in a home one-day international. Eleventh hour: England skipper Alastair Cook is set to make his return from injury on Wednesday . Preparing: Cook came through a full training session on Tuesday ahead of the Third ODI against Sri Lanka . One heavy defeat can be understood in a . side rebuilding from somewhere near rock bottom but another today would . set alarm bells ringing. The emphasis in practice was on positive . cricket ahead of today’s third match. ‘I . don’t think the senior players did as much as they could over the . winter to take some of the pressure off Cooky,’ said Anderson at his . home ground. ‘A captain’s job is difficult and he needs his senior men . to share the burden. ‘We’ve . got a World Cup in eight months so any honeymoon period is going to be . very short and we have to concentrate  on building some momentum. If we . are going to lift that cup we need to start winning quickly. ‘It . can’t always be the captain’s job to discipline people, set tactics or . make the bowling changes. It’s everyone’s job to be thinking about how . we can improve. ‘When we’ve . done well in the past is when we’ve had five or six people who can . stand up in the dressing room and give feedback. That eases the pressure . on the captain.’ It is a message consistent with England wanting their players to stand up for themselves rather than relying on support staff. Back in the nets: Cook practising at Old Trafford in order to keep sharp . There . was even a little glimpse of England’s new attitude after they had a . team picture taken on the Old Trafford outfield — the players were told . to carry their own chairs back into the new pavilion. An attempt to . imitate the All Blacks rugby team, perhaps, who sweep their dressing . room after matches. The role of coach Peter Moores in the desire for . self-sufficiency will be fascinating, because the most common complaint . about his first spell in charge was that he was too ‘full on’ and intent . on doing things his way too quickly. Anderson, . a big supporter of Moores during his first stint in charge and now, has . noticed a subtle change in the former Lancashire coach’s methods. ‘He’s . kind of let everyone get on with their jobs and hasn’t forced too much . on us at this early stage,’ said England’s most successful bowler. ‘I . think he’s going to drip feed things in as we go along. ‘He’s . got strong ideas on where he wants this team to go, as has Cooky, and . hopefully in the coming months you will see us playing a positive brand . of cricket. This isn’t just about getting results, it is about playing . cricket that is good to watch.’ There . was little positive about England’s performance at Chester-le-Street . and Sri Lanka will attempt to take a 2-1 lead in this five-match Royal . London series by concentrating on their traditional strength of spin . Hopeful: England bowler James Anderson has called on players to take the pressure off Cook . Hard . as it was to imagine in Manchester on Tuesday, Sri Lanka captain Angelo . Mathews expects a ‘sub-continental’ type pitch at Old Trafford, similar . to the one produced here for a one-day international in 2011. To . that end Ajantha Mendis and possibly Rangana Herath, who joined the . touring party on Tuesday, could join Sachithra Senanayake in a spin . attack aimed at taking advantage of England’s age-old weakness against . slow bowling. Yet the fact that the forecast says it will be wet here . today should dash any Sri Lankan hopes of a dust-bowl. Bringing back . Cook in place of Michael Carberry is likely to be England’s only change. One . change that may be made going forward relates to Stuart Broad, with his . Notts coach and now England selector Mick Newell suggesting that the . fast bowler will have to give up Twenty20 because of knee problems. ‘Stuart . is a key man in Test and one-day international cricket so in terms of . managing his fitness I think we are going to have to look at Twenty20,’ said Newell. It follows . Broad’s admission earlier this month that he may have to give up the . Twenty20 captaincy because of his desire to prolong his Test career. It seems now that, if Newell has his way, he will go one step further and give up short-form cricket altogether.

The most open and fascinating England selection in years will see three potential debutants named in the squad for next week’s first Test against Sri Lanka as the new panel herald widespread changes. Chris Jordan, Moeen Ali and Sam Robson are all set to feature when national selector James Whitaker reveals his hand, with the probability of a return for a fast bowler seemingly long since jettisoned in Liam Plunkett. An experienced spine of Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Matt Prior, who looks set to edge out Jos Buttler, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson will be joined by an eclectic mix of new and old faces charged with bringing the good times back. Impressive: Chris Jordan (left) has starred for England in the ODI series against Sri Lanka . Accumulator: Australian-born batsman Sam Robson is tipped to open for England with Alastair Cook . The acrimonious end to Tuesday’s . decisive one-day international means there will be plenty of spice when . the sides meet again at Lord’s but the central figure in the ‘Mankading’ drama in Jos Buttler looks set to miss out. England . performed an about-turn on their belief that Buttler was not yet ready . for Test cricket when the dust settled on his world-class one-day . century at Lord’s but they will prefer Prior as long as there is no . reaction to his chronic achilles problem from his first four-day match . of the season with the gloves. Yet . there will be plenty of interest in the new faces, with Jordan sure to . feature after his impressive one-day displays, Moeen likely to get the . nod as a spinning all-rounder and Robson the choice as Cook’s opening . partner. The only concern . about the Australian-born Robson, who is averaging 51 for Middlesex this . season after five centuries for the Lions last winter, is that he is an . accumulator and may make for a one-paced partnership with the captain. Taking his chance: Moeen Ali is set to be called up as a spinning all-rounder . Sacked batsman Kevin Pietersen jokingly made himself available for the first Test, tweeting: ‘England selectors meeting today... I’m ready to go! Fancy Lords next week... I’m a number 4 batter & bowl off spin. #KPforLords’ Yet . it is a concern that the selectors had appeared to have ignored on Wednesday . night when they spurned the option of restoring Joe Root to the opening . berth he vacated during the ill-fated winter and making room in the . middle order for a highly-talented but controversial figure in Samit . Patel. There is no disputing . Patel’s ability, which he has again showed by scoring 682 runs for Notts in the LV= County Championship Division One so far this season, more than any other batsman, . but his failure to reach the required levels of physical fitness have . held him back. Patel was . left out on fitness grounds as recently as the World Twenty20 tournament . in Bangladesh but that was under different management and it will be . intriguing to see moving forward whether the elevation of his county . coach in Mick Newell to the selection panel will change his fortunes . now. On Wednesday it seemed that Patel had missed out but he remains very . much on England’s radar. Plunkett . made the last of his nine Test appearances seven years ago but he has . finally, at 29, fulfilled the potential that Duncan Fletcher saw in him . and has been bowling rapidly to considerable effect for Yorkshire this . season.

Cook (captain), Robson, Bell, Root, Ballance, Moeen, . Prior (keeper), Stokes, Broad, Jordan, Anderson, Plunkett.

Anderson, Broad and Jordan as either 12th man at Lord’s or an . alternative to Ben Stokes should the Durham all-rounder be deemed not . quite fit enough yet. Gary .

England would . love to find a way to get Morgan into their Test team, not least because . of his leadership ability, and the Irishman had the carrot of inclusion . dangled in front of him when he was encouraged to abandon the IPL. Yet . Morgan has not yet put the first-class runs on the board that so many . other challengers have and looked both short of form and out of sorts in . the one-day series that ended in a 3-2 series defeat at Edgbaston.

Six years ago Harry Gurney was contemplating putting his economics degree to use after being released by Leicestershire but now finds himself at the head of a queue of left-arm bowlers competing to fill the missing link in England’s attack. Gurney could never have dreamed that he would be playing in Sunday's second one-day international against Sri Lanka at Durham when his native county turned their back on him just after he had left Leeds University. ‘There were dark times in my early years on the county scene when I wondered whether I would end up making it, so to be here now is amazing,’ said Gurney, who has been given his big chance in the early summer internationals. He's flying now: Harry Gurney is leading England's attack six years after being released by Leicestershire . Hat-trick: Gurney wraps up warm as he trains at Chester-le-Street ahead of the second ODI vs Sri Lanka . Only when Leicestershire had second thoughts and invited Gurney back for a trial at the start of 2009 did his fortunes take a turn for the better. ‘I initially turned it down and went away but if I’m honest there wasn’t a huge amount of interest from other counties,’ admitted Gurney. ‘So I agreed to go back on trial for the first eight weeks of the season. Thankfully I went back in and performed well and they ended up signing me again.’ Even then Gurney did not exactly set the county scene ablaze and he was far from a regular in the Leicestershire side before Mick Newell asked him to make the same short journey from Grace Road to Trent Bridge that made Stuart Broad. ‘In five or six years I only played around 16 first-class games and they were generally when there was an injury to someone else,’ said Gurney, 27. ‘So I never really got the chance to get going in that format. There were times when my position was touch and go so I’ll always be grateful to Mick for coming and signing me for Nottinghamshire.’ Toppling the king: Gurney looks on after cleaning up Sri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara .

Gurney has excelled with Notts to such an extent that he was invited to bowl at England’s Ashes batsmen for a month last winter and has been picked by Peter Moores, a big fan of left-arm seamers after promoting Ryan Sidebottom to the England side in his first spell as coach, in his first three games back at the helm. It was three years ago that David Saker, the England bowling coach, said his attack would be complete if he could find a good left-armer and now Gurney has his chance ahead of a promising crop that includes Tymal Mills, Reece Topley (both of Essex) and David Willey, Northants' young star. ‘I did wonder at one stage of my career whether I’d end up in a suit down in London but I’d certainly rather be running around on a cricket field,’ said Gurney. ‘Playing for England was beyond my dreams growing up but it’s been amazing so far and I want to carry on doing it for as long as I can.’ Well done: Gurney gets a pat on the back from Eoin Morgan (right) during a good display against Sri Lanka .","Gurney nearly dropped out of cricket after release by Leicestershire .

"By . Adam Shergold . Follow @@adamjshergold . It was one of the finest goals seen at a World Cup, the perfect combination of audacity and breath-taking technique. Glancing over his shoulder to check the positioning of Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera, James Rodriguez cushioned the ball expertly on his chest and, in one smooth, elegant movement, dispatched an immaculate volley that crashed in off the bar. If you didn't know of King James of Colombia before, you certainly do now. His thunderbolt setting Colombia on the way to a quarter-final meeting with hosts Brazil and putting him top of the goalscoring charts with five in four games. VIDEO Scroll down for James Rodriguez' memorable moments in his short career so far . King James of Colombia: Rodriguez celebrates his stunning turn and volley against Uruguay that set his country on their way to a quarter-final meeting with Brazil at the World Cup . Perfect technique: Rodriguez unleashes the fierce volley that beat Fernando Muslera's dive and crashed down off the bar . No chance: Muslera is beaten all ends up as Rodriguez's shot hits the bar and bounces down . That strike was certainly a career highlight, but it only scratches the surface of the colourful variety of goals Rodriguez is capable of. Despite being just 22, he has a well-honed free-kick technique - take, for example, the 30-yarder he stuck away for Colombia in their come-from-behind 3-1 win against Chile in qualification for Brazil 2014. There was also his debut goal for Monaco against Rennes in November last year, a beautifully flighted free-kick into the far corner that started to repay the Â£38.5m Monaco paid Porto for him the previous summer. Rodriguez spent three seasons at the Portuguese giants, scoring 32 goals and contributing 21 assists in 105 appearances. His time was marked with three Portuguese titles, a Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Europa League in 2011. There is such beauty and promise in some of the goals he scored there, from deft chips over an advancing goalkeeper to shifting his body weight to deceive defenders before slotting home. Highlights included a well-judged lob at Olhanense in September 2012 that dropped in over the heads of two defenders and the goalkeeper, a sublime one-two and finish into the top corner to draw Porto level against rivals Benfica and a late curled winner on the left foot to beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League (see next video). It was also soon clear that Rodriguez had the ability to control matches - he was composed in possession and always knew where his team-mates stood. Whether the pass was long-range or short, Rodriguez was able to find someone in the same colours, while he excelled too at crossing and direct running. Rodriguez has been scoring lovely goals on the European scene for some time - and with Argentine club Banfield beforehand - but now his presence is truly global. With offers likely to flood in from leading clubs in the Premier League and La Liga, Rodriguez could soon be bringing such exceptional abilities to an even loftier level. And finally... A teenage Rodriguez scores directly from a corner .","22-year-old Rodriguez scored goal of the World Cup so far as Colombia beat Uruguay .

"By . Adam Shergold . It was meant to be a night of triumph, another step towards the realisation of Brazil's ultimate dream. But this World Cup semi-final quickly turned into a living nightmare as irresistible Germany ripped the hosts apart before a disbelieving crowd in Belo Horizonte. And one of the main scapegoats for this humiliation is sure to be Fred, the centre forward who was absent in body and mind throughout, touching the ball simply to get the play restarted after each crushing blow. Here's the clockwatch of Fred's night of abject misery. VIDEO Scroll down for Fred vs Jo - highlights . Stuff of nightmares: Brazil striker Fred was absolutely anonymous as his team were thrashed by Germany in the World Cup semi-final . Ineffective: Fred failed to make any impression on proceedings in Belo Horizonte whatsoever as germany dominated . Out-muscled: Fred is easily pushed off the ball by German defender Mats Hummels . 7.30pm The Brazil squad arrive by coach at the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as a nation holds its collective breath. Fred, like all of his team-mates, wear baseball caps with a 'Forca Neymar' slogan printed on them as they stroll to the dressing room. Ah yes, Neymar. Anybody mentioned him lately? The absence of the Selecao's talisman piles even more pressure on Fluminense's forward Fred, who has found the net just the once in the World Cup so far - against Cameroon in the third group match. 7.45pm Despite his record being much-maligned, Fred is named in Luiz Felipe Scolari's starting line-up. With the absence of Neymar, there was little alternative, with Fred the spearhead of an attacking quartet with Bernard, Oscar and Hulk behind him. 8.15pm The stadium, a picturesque sea of yellow, explodes as the Brazilian players come out for their warm-up. There is a deafening roar of 'Brasil, Brasil!' from those exceedingly fortunate fans inside the ground. Time to deliver: Fred goes through his warm-up routine at the Estadio Mineirao ahead of the semi-final showdown . Steely focus: Fred walks out of the tunnel ahead of the match . Ready for action: The Brazil team line-up for the cameras ahead of kick-off, holding up a No 10 shirt in tribute to their injured talisman, Neymar . 8.55pm 200 million people are united as the Brazilian team line up for the national anthem, sung in stirring 'a cappella' style as it reaches a deafening crescendo. Fred, third from the end of the line, belts it out like the rest of his team-mates. It is time for him to deliver. 5min Brazil have started the match with positive intent, bossing the possession and enjoying the first chance when Marcelo fires wide. Fred, however, is struggling to find space inside the German box and doesn't touch the ball in the opening five minutes. 8min Fred finally enters the action, chesting down a lovely flighted ball from the right on the edge of the area, but he's unable to thread it through to the onrushing Oscar. 11min GOAL - Brazil 0-1 Germany: Awful defending from Brazil as a corner reaches Thomas Muller totally unmarked in the box. He has all the time in the world to cushion the ball past Julio Cesar. That is the fifth goal Germany have scored from a set-piece at this tournament and shows that Brazil clearly haven't done their homework. Early touch: Fred controls the ball and steers it away from Thomas Muller during the opening few moments . Squaring up: Fred has a word with German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer . 16min Maicon advances well down the right and attempts to swing in a cross to Fred, who has found a little bit of room. Frustratingly for the Brazil No 9, it's blocked by a German defender and the danger passes. 22min GOAL - Brazil 0-2 Germany: An absolute disaster for Brazil! Miroslav Klose with a record-breaking goal as he becomes the all-time leading goalscorer in the World Cup, overtaking the Brazilian great Ronaldo. It's all too simple as Klose pounces on a loose ball inside the box and finishes on the rebound after his initial effort is saved by Cesar. 24min GOAL - Brazil 0-3 Germany: From bad to worse... Philipp Lahm's low pass across the 18-yard box evades Muller but simply runs through to Toni Kroos to drill the ball into the bottom corner first-time with his left foot. Dejection: Fred and Oscar prepare to kick off yet again as Germany continue their glorious first-half goal rush . 26min GOAL - Brazil 0-4 Germany: Complete and utter silence from those in yellow shirts as Germany add a fourth - their third goal in three minutes. Sami Khedira easily wins the ball in midfield and squares for Kroos to score again. The camera pans to Fred, stood about 80 yards away. Seldom has a player looked so utterly, utterly helpless. 29min GOAL - Brazil 0-5 Germany: And another! Brazil's defence has completely capitulated, this is embarrassing. Ozil practically walks through the heart of the Brazil defence and tucks the ball back to Khedira to find the bottom corner. Floored: Fred trips over the challenge of Germany's Mats Hummels as Brazil struggle to make any impression going forward . 44min Brazil finally get their act together and launch what could be a cohesive attack. But when the ball forward comes, it just goes through Fred, who seems to be afraid of touching it. He pleads for a foul but the referee is having none of it. There are boos and jeers from the crowd. Perhaps at the decision, more likely at the impotent player. HALF-TIME: Brazil go back to the dressing room trailing 5-0. The crowd are in tears, the dream dying in front of their eyes. Fred has touched the ball no more than a handful of times, he is absolutely hopeless and it would be a surprise to see him re-emerge for the second period. Embarrassing: Fred's heat map at half-time shows that he spent more time with the ball kicking off in the centre circle than anywhere else on the pitch . Head's up: Fred beats a static Philipp Lahm to the ball in the air . 46min Incredibly, despite being completely anonymous for the whole first-half, Fred has stayed on. Hulk and Fernandinho are sacrificed, with Ramires and Paulinho coming on. 48min Fred is the target for a long ball forward from deep and he falls over under the slightest contact from Per Mertesacker. It's a con trick to try and win a penalty but the referee isn't interested and waves play on as Fred rolls around on the floor. 50min Fred's best involvement in the match so far... it's only taken 50 minutes. He initially controls the ball away from goal on the edge of the box but then finds some space and slips it through to Ramires, whose low cross is palmed away well by Neuer. 58min At last, a shot at goal by Fred. It comes to him about 20 yards from goal and the best he can manage is a tame daisy-cutter that is easily picked up by Neuer. The crowd bellows in disgust. Lightweight: Fred falls under slight pressure from Per Mertesacker . Frustration: Fred reacts with dismay as yet another Brazilian attack breaks down . 66min Fred has a quick touch about 30 yards from goal. It is greeted with the kind of reception from the crowd that suggests he might have to go into hiding for some time. 69min GOAL! Brazil 0-6 Germany: Yet more shambolic defending as Brazil have no answer to Germany's one-touch passing. Lahm crosses low from the right and substitute Andre Schurrle sweeps it in from close range. 70min SUBBED OFF - That's it, Fred is finally put out of his misery as Scolari hooks him off for Willian with 20 minutes left. It's fair to say that few inside the ground, or in Brazil as a whole, are too disappointed with that decision. Out of his misery: Fred was substituted off for Willian with 20 minutes remaining . Poor: Fred's final heat map in the match . Sympathy: Joey Barton was at least on Fred's side . VIDEO Fred vs Jo - highlights . 71min - Fred is shown on the big screen sat on the bench nursing a bottle of Powerade and catching his breath. Jeers once again ring around the stadium! 79min - GOAL! Brazil 0-7 Germany: Not much Fred can do now, but Schurrle adds a magnificent seventh by rifling the ball into the roof of the net. 90min - GOAL! Brazil 1-7 Germany: Not a great deal of consolation but Oscar skips through a tired German defence to fire home in stoppage time. FULL-TIME: Brazil 1-7 Germany - It's safe to say no one saw that coming. One of the biggest humiliations in World Cup history. And Fred's performance just about summed it up for Brazil.","Brazil striker was under increased pressure after injury to Neymar .

"By . Adam Shergold . Click here to view our brilliant Match Zone service including Tim Cahill's header . Alexis Sanchez inspired Chile to a winning start at the World Cup - but they were forced to work hard by an Australia team who looked early on as if they would be utterly humiliated. Living up to their 'dark horses' tag, Chile raced into a two-goal lead inside 16 minutes as Barcelona star Sanchez scored one and created another for Jorge Valdivia. But the South Americans couldn't convert their possession into further goals and were caught cold when Tim Cahill headed Australia back into contention before half-time. They wasted a number of good chances to gain a point in Cuiaba as Claudio Bravo was forced into good saves from Cahill and Mark Bresciano. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chile fans celebrate in Santiago after beating Australia 3-1 . Opener: Frontman Alexis Sanchez (right) wheels away to celebrate after giving Chile the lead against Australia .

Subs: Langerak, Wright, Taggart, Halloran, Bozanic, Troisi, Holland, McKay, McGowan, Vidosic, Luongo, Galekovic. Scorer: Cahill, 35. Referee: Noumandiez Doue (Ivory Coast) And in the end, it needed a stoppage time strike from Wiganâ€™s Jean Beausejour to make absolutely sure of Chileâ€™s opening night success. With Holland demolishing defending champions Spain beforehand, any fears this match would come after the Lord Mayor's show were instantly dispelled. Chile's dark horses galloped away and it soon looked like being a procession. The players gave a rousing a cappella crescendo to their national anthem and, powered by a sense of patriotic duty, tore into their timid opponents. With their first attack of note, on 12 minutes, Charles Aranguiz did well to keep his balance and shield the ball from goalkeeper Maty Ryan sprawling at his feet. Turning away from goal, he dug out a cross that was only half-cleared to the feet of Sanchez and the Barcelona star, unhurried by anyone in a yellow shirt, rattled the ball into the bottom corner. It was his ninth goal in his last 12 international appearances and the highlight of a masterful first-half in which he tormented Jason Davidson with his pace, flair and trickery. Flying high: Australia frontman Tim Cahill climbs highest to head the ball home against Chile . Helpless: Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo reacts as former Everton man Cahill rolls back the years to score . Game on! Cahill celebrates his header with Mark Milligan (right) and Jason Davidson (left) Before Australia could regroup, they were two in arrears. Sanchez collected the ball in midfield and charged to the edge of the penalty box. With Eduardo Vargas drawing away Australian defenders like a magnet, Valdivia was left alone to smash the ball home. It was Chile con carnage. The game had barely started, yet Chile were indulging in 'Ole' football to the delight of their thousands of fans who had made the relatively short trip to Cuiaba. Back in 2010, the group containing Spain and Chile saw just eight goals in total. This time round, that tally had been matched in just 106 minutes as the frustrating caution of opening World Cup group games at the last tournament was thrown to the wind. Chile dominated possession - their percentage share high in the seventies - and they hassled Australian players like Duracell bunnies whenever they didn't have the ball. But their refusal to retreat and consolidate after taking a two-goal lead came back to bite them. Coming together: Chile midfielder Gary Medel confronts Cahill during the first half of Friday's Group B clash . Block: Chile midfielder Charles Aranguiz is denied by Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan . Keep going: Head coach Ange Postecoglou encourages his Australia players from the touchline . Committed: Australia's Ivan Franjic dispossesses Chile frontman Eduardo Vargas . From absolutely nothing, Australia halved the deficit when Tim Cahill hung in the air above the static Gary Medel to place an inch-perfect right-wing cross past Claudio Bravo. It was trademark, timeless Tim - the kind of header he has made a living out of for Millwall and Everton and the national team. His fifth goal in his last five international games, he joined Holland's Robin van Persie in scoring at each of the 2006, 2010 and 2014 finals. The Socceroos suddenly sprung to life and came close to equalising moments after when Cahill shot low and hard against the shins of Bravo. Grounded: Cahill falls to the ground after being challenged by two Chile midfielders . Battle: Australia wideman Tommy Oar holds off the challenge of Aranguiz at the Arena Pantanal . Going close: Chile's Isla sees his effort on goal blocked by the foot of Australia defender Jason Davidson . Aerial duel: Chile midfielder Medel gets the better of Cahill in the air to head the ball forward . The momentum continued to shift after half-time and, after Mexico vs Cameroon, the day's theme of disallowed goals continued when Cahill was correctly flagged offside as he headed Mathew Leckie's cross past the Chilean keeper. Mark Bresciano then twisted his body to fire off a shot that seemed destined for the bottom corner until Bravo stretched out a strong hand to halt the ball. Finally, Chile found a second wind and Vargas skipped through the Australian defence only to see Alex Wilkinson hack his poked effort off the goalline. It was all Australian pressure in the final 10 minutes but they lacked a cutting edge and, as the clock ticked down, Beausejour found the bottom corner with an accurate low drive.","Chile kick off World Cup campaign with 3-1 victory over Australia .

"By . Adam Shergold . Andres Iniesta talks from a position of authority when he discusses the World Cup. He is, after all, a member of an exclusive club — those who know how it feels to score in the final. Only 56 players have scored in a World Cup final and Iniesta belongs to the elite collection who know the elation of scoring the winner. He is admirably modest for someone who has seen, done and won so much. But his shy eyes sparkle when asked to recount the proudest moment of his glittering career four years ago, a glimpse of beauty in an otherwise ugly final with Holland at Soccer City in Johannesburg. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Spain players training... Same please! Andres Iniesta believes Spain can repeat their 2010 triumph by winning the World Cup again . Commeth the man: Andres Iniesta scored the winning goal in Spain's 1-0 victory over Holland in 2010 . Everybody loves Kung Fu fighting! Holland tried to unsettle Spain by using destructive tactics in the final . ‘It was the best thing that’s ever happened to me,’ Iniesta recalls. ‘Not only for me on a personal level but also for the Spanish team. ‘There are not many other moments in life when you can feel any more overjoyed than that.’ Only two of the Dutch outfield players were not booked by English referee Howard Webb, with playmaker Iniesta seemingly the No 1 target in their brutal masterplan. Holland’s strategy of aggressive containment worked for 116 minutes. Then, with penalties looming, Cesc Fabregas released Iniesta inside the box. A touch with his outstretched right boot sent it invitingly forward at the perfect height to smash into the far corner. ‘When I scored, what was in my mind was that there wasn’t a lot of time left and I just really wanted the referee to blow the whistle!’ But if the goal was the mark of Iniesta as a player, his celebration was the measure of him as a man.  After checking for an offside flag, Iniesta whipped off his shirt to reveal a hand-scribbled message dedicated to his Spain youth teammate Dani Jarque, who had died of a heart attack 11 months earlier. Tribute: Spain midfielder celebrated by showing a message in honour of a former teammate who passed away . Ever present: Andres Iniesta was also part of Spain's team that won the Euros in 2008 (L) and 2012 (R) Thirsty work: Andres Iniesta is the official ambassador for drinks company Powerade at the World Cup . A few seconds of reflection in the ultimate moment of glory. The World Cup triumph in South Africa is the highest of Spanish football’s three peaks — they also won back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012 — and Iniesta has scaled them all. in all three, he was named in the Team of the Tournament. In 2010 and 2012, he was chosen Man of the Match in the final. It is an unprecedented spell of domination but surely it cannot continue in Brazil this summer? ‘We hope it will,’ Iniesta says. ‘We have managed an unprecedented feat but there are always challenges. This is going to be a new, big challenge going to Brazil in the position of defending champions.’ The core of Vicente del Bosque’s side, featuring Iniesta’s Barcelona teammates Xavi, Fabregas and Sergio Busquets, plus Xabi Alonso of Real Madrid, remains intact while exciting new additions such as Atletico Madrid’s Koke prove the talent pool hasn’t dried up. On target: The Barcelona playmaker (C) celebrates after scoring in a warm up friendly against Bolivia . Rare loss: Fred (L) celebrates scoring the opening goal as Brazil beat Spain 3-0 in the Confederations Cup final . But faced with the vibrancy and fluidity of hosts Brazil in the Confederations Cup final last summer, Spain were starved of possession, off the pace and jaded, losing 3-0. That was only the third defeat suffered by Del Bosque in competitive matches since he took the reins nearly six years ago and Iniesta does not believe their dominance is about to end soon. ‘I don’t believe we are hugely  different from last time,’ he says. ‘We’ve had our moments but we have to keep in mind that Spain has one World Cup and Brazil has five.’ Spain have been paired with  Holland, Chile and Australia in an awkward looking Group B, rivalling England’s tricky assignment as the ‘Group of Death’. ‘I think they will all bring different styles but ultimately football is a leveller,’ he predicts. ‘They are all difficult but we are confident we can get out of the group.’ Group of Death: Spain must get past Robin van Persie's Holland (L) and Alexis Sanchez's Chile (R) Do you believe? England should always be considered among the favourites to win, claims Andres Iniesta . England could find themselves on a collision course with the defending champions at the quarter-final stage and Iniesta is characteristically diplomatic on the chances of Roy Hodgson’s team. ‘England has always got to be a candidate, it has always got to be considered one of the favourites because of the history, because of the players, because they have a particularly defined style,’ he says. ‘They’ve got really good players, talented players, but apart from that what will really drive them is the desire to improve on the performance they had in 2010.’ Iniesta and Spain, of course, can’t improve on 2010. But they would settle for more of the same.

"By . Adam Shergold . Follow @@adamjshergold . Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's glamorous girlfriend Novella Benini kept a close eye on the progress of the team as they trained on Thursday ahead of their 'Rumble in the Jungle' clash with England. Wearing shades and a baseball cap to keep out the strong Brazilian sun in Mangaratiba, Miss Benini watched on from the sidelines as her partner Prandelli took the session. With two days left, the coach must make a decision over whether to play the in-form striker Ciro Immobile against England in their opening Group D clash at the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus. Close watch: Cesare Prandelli's girlfriend Novella Benini checks on the progress of the Italy team as they trained in Managaratiba ahead of Saturday's World Cup opener against England in Manaus . Blowing a kiss? Prandelli poses for the camera as he leads Italy's training session close to their Rio de Janeiro base . Immobile, who scored 23 goals in 34 matches for Torino last season, proved he could adapt easily to the international stage when scoring a hat-trick and setting up two more goals in Italy's 5-3 win over Fluminense on Sunday. That result was welcome after disappointing draws against the Republic of Ireland and Luxembourg suggested the Azzurri were far from ready to tackle a group containing England, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Even though Italy have not yet made the four-hour flight up to Manaus, where temperatures are expected to top 30C during the England game, some of their players seemed to be struggling with the heat. Mario Balotelli and Andrea Pirlo looked to be among those struggling as the sun beat down on their training at the Portobello Resort.

Dream partnership: Immobile could start up front alongside Mario Balotelli (left) in Manaus . Despite pre-tournament expectations in Italy being quite low, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has called for unity and a belief that they can advance to the latter stages of the tournament. Ancelotti told the team to take inspiration from his Madrid side that won the Champions League last season. 'When you take part in a World Cup there is always a lot of excitement and tension and everyone needs to chip in if you want to achieve something big,' said Ancelotti in a letter published in La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'However, people are sceptical about our chances, and do not believe in us. Well, I can guarantee that if the team and the coaching staff stay united and all read from the same page, then the atmosphere will become more favourable, and results are more likely to go our way.

That's why now it's important to encourage Italians to get behind our lads.' The Italian admitted that Prandelli's side are far from being the tournament favourites, but also pointed out Italy were unfancied before the victorious World Cups of 1982 and 2006. 'We are in a difficult group,' admitted Ancelotti, 'but our opponents should be worried about our presence in it. One thing is for certain, facing Italy is difficult for every team. We are a strong team tactically, we are experienced and we have players that can make the difference.'","Italy train close to their Rio de Janeiro base ahead of flight to Manaus .

"By . Adam Shergold . Tony Adams has urged England to 'throw caution to the wind' in Thursday night's must-win World Cup clash with Uruguay, but warned they must learn the defensive lessons from the loss to Italy. The Arsenal and England legend says Roy Hodgson was too attacking in Saturday night's opener in Manaus and should have concentrated on a strong defensive performance to avoid defeat. But after Mario Balotelli's second-half winner left England's hopes of reaching the last 16 in the balance, Hodgson has been left with little alternative but to go for it against the South Americans. Must win: Former England defender Tony Adams says Roy Hodgson's team must improve defensively if they are to stand a chance of beating Uruguay and stay in the World Cup . International duty: Adams playing for England against Spain in the Euro 96 quarter-final. Adams won 66 caps for England, scoring five times . Former centre-half Adams, who won 66 caps for his country, told Sportsmail: 'The one massive negative from the night was that we were too positive. 'At times we did the English thing and went in with our hearts over our heads. We had a fixation with having a go and Hodgson had 65m England fans screaming for them to attack. 'I thought we were a bit naive, trying to win the World Cup in the first 20 minutes. I'm all in favour of being positive and going forward but only if we have a solid defensive unit. 'We should have worked more on the back four and Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson in front of them and prioritised trying to keep a clean sheet.' Grounded: Gary Cahill is left slumped on the floor and Joe Hart in the net as Mario Balotelli scores Italy's winner against England in Saturday's World Cup opener . Do or die: Roy Hodgson knows England must do everything they can to win against Uruguay . Uruguay are not the same proposition as Italy, as shown by their shock 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica, but with Liverpool star Luis Suarez returning from injury, they have the ability to unlock England's defence. Adams said: 'There is extreme pressure on both England and Uruguay - this is a knockout tie. 'England will want to go forward and impress but they need to keep a clean sheet. Glen Johnson and Leighton Baines need to stay back and stay focused otherwise Suarez will expose them.' Much of the discussion in the days in between the two fixtures has focused on Wayne Rooney's place and position in the team but Adams says others can play the No 10 role. 'If Rooney plays, he should be in the No 10 role but there are lots of options. Personally, I would have liked to have seen Rickie Lambert up there having a go,' Adams said. Mixed bag: Wayne Rooney helped set up England's goal, scored by Daniel Sturridge, but otherwise endured a frustrating evening out on the left wing against Italy . Impact: Adams would like to see Rickie Lambert given an opportunity to impress against Uruguay . Coming for you: Luis Suarez is fit again and determined to knock England out of the World Cup . 'People are over the top with Rooney - what's wrong with taking him off after 60 minutes and letting someone else have a go? 'I'd also back Jack Wilshere in that No 10 role. We do also have plenty of people to open up Uruguay with pace and quality - Welbeck, Sterling, Sturridge. 'Because of the result in the first game, we need to throw caution to the wind. All things considered, we should win.' Teenage kicks: Raheem Sterling was impressive against Italy and England will need another strong performance from the Liverpool tyro . Shining light: Lionel Messi celebrates his splendid solo goal against Bosnia in the Maracana Stadium . With the first round of group stage matches completed and all 32 teams observed, Adams is sticking with his pre-tournament prediction of an Argentina win. Lionel Messi's side weren't at their best in the 2-1 win over Bosnia-Hercegovina but with Iran and Nigeria to come, are well on their way to the last 16. 'I tipped Argentina before the World Cup and I hope Messi can inspire them to win because he's the best player I've ever seen. 'He can never be up there with the likes of Pele and Diego Maradona until he lifts the world Cup.'

"By . Adam Shergold . England shift their World Cup preparations up another gear on Wednesday night as they take on Ecuador at Miami's Sun Life Stadium. It's the first of two warm-up friendlies Roy Hodgson's team will play there this week, with Honduras to follow on Saturday. Here's our lowdown on the Ecuador team that will line-up against England. Line-up: Ecuador pose for a team photograph ahead of their World Cup qualifier with Uruguay in Quito . Match details . The match kicks-off at 8pm UK time (3pm Miami time) and will be screened live on ITV. There will be a live blog on Mail Online Sport if you're not near a TV. It is at the Sun Life Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins NFL team and former home of the Florida Marlins baseball team. It has hosted five Super Bowls and two baseball World Series in the past. When soccer games are staged there, it has a capacity of 74,918 but only 10,000 are expected for the England vs Ecuador game. Local interest is low because the 3pm kick-off clashes with work and not too many England fans have travelled over, preferring to save their money for the World Cup in Brazil. The venue: England will play Ecuador at the Sun Life Stadium, the home of NFL team Miami Dolphins . Through their paces: The England team train at the Sun Life Stadium ahead of Wednesday night's match . Are Ecuador in the World Cup? Yes they are. They finished fourth in the South American qualification group, behind Argentina, Colombia and Chile, after taking 25 points from 16 matches. 'Home advantage' gains a new definition when it comes to Ecuador, as they play their games in Quito, 9,300ft above sea level up in the Andes. It is the highest capital city in the world and their opponents don't like visiting. In the qualification campaign, they won seven and drew one of their matches there (Argentina earned a 1-1 draw). Heading for Brazil: The Ecuador team train at the Sun Life Stadium ahead of their final warm-up friendly. They have been paired with France, Switzerland and Honduras in Group E . When they go down the mountain, Ecuador are nowhere near as effective - in qualifying, they lost five and drew three on the road. They've been paired with Switzerland, Honduras and France in Group E and will fancy their chances of progressing to the knockout phase. They open against Switzerland in Brasilia on June 15, then play Honduras in Curitiba on June 20 and France in Rio de Janeiro on June 25. Eyes on the ball: Defender Walter Ayovi during training in Miami on Tuesday . What's their World Cup pedigree? Ecuador have qualified for the World Cup finals on two previous occasions. They made their bow in 2002, losing to Italy and Mexico before beating Croatia in Group G. Returning in 2006, wins over Poland and Costa Rica were enough to see them out of Group A behind hosts Germany. As you'll probably remember, England knocked them out in the last 16 thanks to David Beckham's second-half free-kick. Bend it like... David Beckham curls home England's winner against Ecuador in the 2006 World Cup second round . Celebration time: Beckham is grabbed by Ashley Cole after his free-kick found the back of the net . Goalkeepers: Maximo Banguera (Barcelona SC), Alexander Dominguez (LDU Quito), Adrian Bone (El Nacional) Defenders: . Frickson Erazo (Flamengo), Jorge Guagua, Oscar Bagui, Gabriel Achilier . (all Emelec), Walter Ayovi (Pachuca), Juan Carlos Paredes (Barcelona SC) Midfielders: . Segundo Castillo (Al-Hilal), Carlos Gruezo (VfB Stuttgart), Renato .

(Independiente Santa Fe), Michael Arroyo (Atlante) Forwards: . Felipe Caicedo (Al-Jazira), Jefferson Montero (Morelia), Joao Rojas . (Cruz Azul), Fidel Martinez, Jaime Ayovi (both Tijuana), Enner Valencia . (Pachuca) Who's in the final 23 for Brazil? Coach Reinaldo Rueda named his final squad list on Monday following a friendly with Mexico over the weekend. He included Segundo Castillo in the 23 despite the midfielder needing another three weeks to recover from a knee injury sustained in that match. The coach considers Castillo, a veteran of their last tournament back in 2006, an essential part of his team though he might not see any action after taking a nasty knock on the knee in the clash that saw Mexico's Luis Montes break his leg. Rueda's only surprise pick is the 19-year-old Stuttgart midfielder Carlos Gruezo. What kind of form are they in? Ecuador have played three matches this year, with varied results. They stormed back from three goals down to beat Australia 4-3 in a friendly played at The Den back in March, held Holland to a 1-1 draw in the Amsterdam Arena last month and then lost 3-1 to Mexico in Arlington, Texas on Saturday. Contrasting emotions: Edison Mendez looks on as Mexico celebrate a goal by Luis Montes (No 20) in Saturday's friendly in Arlington . Who's the boss? 57-year-old Colombian Rueda took charge in 2010. He guided Honduras to only their second-ever World Cup but came in for criticism for the tactics he deployed out in South Africa and subsequently stepped down. He negotiated Ecuador to the finals in Brazil without any trouble and now he will be expected to at least match their run to the Last 16 back in 2006. Rueda was asked about the threat posed by Wayne Rooney in Wednesday night's match but he chose to concentrate on the collective. The boss: Reinaldo Rueda has been Ecuador manager since 2010 . 'Their team is at a tremendous level throughout, so it's not just about one player,' he said. 'Rooney is a goalscorer and a leader, we know that, but England have Gerrard, they have Lampard, they have Welbeck, they have Smalling. 'Rooney is Rooney, but we focus on the collective and they are a strong side.' Which players will I recognise? Antonio Valencia is the name that leaps from the Ecuador teamsheet. The Manchester United winger continues to delight and infuriate the Old Trafford faithful in equal measure - in some matches, his pace and crossing can be a real weapon; in others, he barely registers. Main man: Man United winger Antonio Valencia in action for his country against Australia back in March . Valencia, 28, contributed four goals and six assists for United last season, a pretty dismal return for someone of his ability. If Ecuador are to make waves in this tournament, they need their captain and talisman to be at the top of his game. You might also remember Felipe Caicedo, the striker who made a few appearances for Manchester City after moving from Basel for Â£5.2m in January 2008 but spent most of his time out on loan. He's still only 25 but now plays for Al-Jazira in the United Arab Emirates after a two-year stop-off at Lokomotiv Moscow. Practice: Former Manchester City striker Felipe Caicedo perfects his shooting technique in training . Who else should I look out for? Jefferson Montero's stock rose back in November when Valencia said he wouldn't mind if Man United signed him. The winger is well travelled for his 24 years, with 39 international caps and eight goals to his name. Having been unable to hold down a first team place during his two seasons at Villarreal, Montero now plays for Mexican side Monarcas Morelia. Speedster: Jefferson Montero shows the Mexican defence a clean pair of heels during the weekend's friendly match . The aforementioned Castillo, 32, spent some time in England on loan at Everton and then Wolves while playing for Red Star Belgrade and now plays for Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia. Everton fans may remember his one and only goal for the club, a 25-yard volley against Standard Liege in a 2008 UEFA Cup tie. Ouch: The collision between Mexico's Luis Montes and Ecuador's Segundo Castillo that left the former out of the World Cup and the latter fighting for fitness . Christian Noboa, another midfielder, plays for Dynamo Moscow and has been in Russia for seven years now. The 29-year-old won two Russian league titles with his former club Rubin Kazan and played in the Champions League. P.S.

The whacky piece, entitled Arab Spring, tells you everything you need to know about the competition - an annual celebration of 'crap art'. The tongue-in-cheek competition is derived from Britain's leading art competition the Turner Prize - and it is safe to say that it doesn't take itself quite as seriously. The Arab Spring: Constructed from a car spring, a tea towel and a pair of sunglasses this piece encapsulates the Turnip Prize, held in the New Inn pub in Wedmore, Somerset . Stone He Broke: This pun on the British slang phrase Stony Broke is typical of the witty entries to the competition .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Minneapolis police are investigating a shooting inside a popular downtown nightclub that injured 9 people, including Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Linval Joseph. The team released a statement Saturday saying Joseph, 25, was struck by a bullet in the calf. He was treated for a minor injury and released. The Vikings described Joseph, a former member of the New York Giants team, as an innocent bystander in the shooting that broke out inside the club 400 SoundBar. Victim: Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Linval Joseph was shot in the calf in a Minneapolis nightclub Saturday along with eight other patrons . Violent night: Gunfire broke out inside the club 400 SoundBar in what police are calling a gang-related incident . Police spokesman Scott Seroka says two people with serious injuries were in stable condition Saturday and expected to survive. He didn't know the exact condition of the other seven but described most as having minor injuries. Club owner Johann Sfaellos told the Minneapolis Star Tribune it was a typical night with patrons busy socializing and dancing to live music, with no fights until he heard gunshots at around 1.40am. After squeezing off several rounds into the crowd, sending terrified patrons ducking for cover, the shooter dropped the gun to the floor and fled. Police revealed today that the incident was gang-related, with the unidentified gunman targeting one of the victims. Mayor Betsy Hodges said at the request of the city SoundBar has been shut down indefinitely. Wrong place, wrong time: The Vikings described Joseph, 25, as an innocent bystander in the shooting; he has been treated for his injury and released . Meanwhile, the injured NFL player is recovering at home and is expected to rejoin his team next week. Joseph signed a five-year, $31.25million contract with the Vikings in March after playing four seasons with the Giants. Police are still looking for the shooter. Seroka expected more information to be released Monday.","Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Linval Joseph, 25, was treated for bullet wound to the calf and released .

"By . Adam Shergold . The watching world were treated to a celebration of colour, dance and music as Brazil officially unleashed the 2014 World Cup. The location? Arena de Sao Paulo, Brazil. The reason? Kick-starting the world's greatest tournament, and in some style too. Much was debated as to whether Brazil would be up to hosting the World Cup but, judging by this opening ceremony, they seem to be off to a fairly good start. Host commentator . Right, that's my bit done for now. I'll hand you over to Dan Ripley, who will bring you full live commentary on Brazil vs Croatia here. And with that, J Lo and her co-performers run, smiling and waving, from the field and the opening ceremony draws to a close. That was a short affair, but very sweet and colourful and we now have just over an over until the match between Brazil and Croatia gets underway. And now the ball in the middle of the pitch has split into segments to reveal, oh yes, Jennifer Lopez belting out the official World Cup song 'We Are One (Ola Ola)' alongside Pitbull. She's wearing a very revealing green sequin dress and looking very fine indeed. He's wearing white trousers that look uncomfortably high. We've also got the delightful Claudia Leitte on stage in a blue sparkly dress. Now, at last, the ceremony acknowledges that a football tournament is about to take place as kids in the colours of the 32 nations make their way into the middle and show off some juggling skills with a ball on an elastic string. The colourful globe in the middle going mad now, showing the flags of all the countries and then the Brazuca, the official ball of the competition. Now a demonstration of the traditional and very exciting Brazilian martial art of Capoeira. England's players tried their hand at it when they toured Rio de Janeiro the other day. We've now moved on from the nature phase to celebrate the rich diversity of Brazil, with hundreds of performers in bright costumes twirling around and dancing to a classic Brazilian rhythm. The preparations for the opening ceremony as thorough as for the tournament itself. Workshops to find and train those taking part tonight started back in March and there have been some 84 hours of rehearsals to get them fully drilled and in sync. At the moment, the rather mesmerizing ball continues to swirl and glow in its many colours as everyone dances around. some are on trampolines and some in canoes, each aspect designed to reflect a part of Brazilian life. The opening ceremony underway now in Sao Paulo and, at the moment, we have lots of people dressed as trees and flowers striding their way across the very colourful stage. In the centre of it all, a swirling multi-coloured ball serves as an eye-catching centrepiece. Each of the props used in tonight's ceremony has been designed with an even weight distribution so as not to cause any damage to the playing surface here. If you've seen the shocking state of the pitch in Manaus, where England will play Italy on Saturday, you'll know this is very wise indeed. A little bit of time-keeping for you - the opening ceremony is expected to get underway at 7.15pm UK time (so very shortly indeed) and will last about 25 minutes or so. There will then be quite a lot of time for Adrian Chiles and his ITV colleagues to fill until the actual kick-off at 9pm. Oliver Todd: While coaches speak of the value of experience at a World Cup, it is inevitably the lesser heard-of young players who provide some of every tournament’s stand-out moments. Roy Hodgson has made the effort to inject his squad with young talent to spring a surprise on England’s opponents, but across the competition other countries are doing the same with not-so-big names looking to make an impact. So looking ahead, here’s 10 players you might not have heard of who can light up the World Cup. Click the link above to read. From referees squirting shaving foam on the pitch to mystic turtles, here's Riath Al-Samarrai with a top ten of things you will see at the World Cup for the first time this summer.

The World Cup kicks off this evening, the pomp and pageantry of the opening ceremony at the Arena de Sao Paulo leading in to the first course - Brazil vs Croatia. Stay with me here for all the best pictures and coverage of the opening ceremony and then I'll hand you over to Mr Dan Ripley for the first of 64 matches at the world's greatest sporting spectacle.","Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull and Claudia Leitte sing World Cup anthem 'We Are One'

"By . Jason Groves . and Matt Chorley . Auditors have warned that Iain Duncan Smith¿s flagship welfare reform has got off to a disastrous start and should be delayed to prevent further losses to the taxpayer . Iain Duncan Smith today sought to pin the blame for the disastrous start of his flagship welfare reforms on inept civil servants. The Work and Pensions Secretary said he 'lost faith' in his own civil servants running the huge Universal Credit project. He accused them of 'just wanting to be able to say it was going well' even as the £2.4billion project hit problems. In a devastating report the National Audit Office says Universal Credit is beset by ‘weak management, ineffective control and poor governance’. The scheme, which will replace a string of out-of-work benefits, is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours. But auditors warn that the £2.4billion project has ‘not achieved value for money’, partly because of unrealistic timetables imposed by ministers. A £425million IT system is still not working properly and £34million of equipment has already been written off. The NAO says the scheme ‘still has the potential to create significant benefits for society’. But it suggests the deadline for rolling out the scheme by 2017 may have to be put back, adding that the Department for Work and Pensions ‘must scale back its delivery ambition and set out realistic plans’. The findings are a major blow to Mr Duncan Smith, who has staked his reputation on delivering the complex project on time. The minister is expected to be called to Parliament today to answer questions from MPs about why he repeatedly told the Commons the project was on track while knowing it was at risk of collapse. But Mr Duncan Smith today claimed he could have written the report himself. He told the BBC: 'I lost faith in the ability of the civil servants to be able to manage this programme. 'So we brought in people from outside, we brought in the Cabinet Office, working with my colleagues, to ensure that this programme could be delivered within the scope of how it was planned and make sure that it was delivered within budget – not going back to the Treasury for any more money.' He added that the officials 'charged with putting in place the IT didn't make the correct decisions'. Having invested in the wrong systems, there was then a refusal to admit there was a problem, he added. 'There was a sense that somehow they just wanted to be able to say it was all going well,' Mr Duncan Smith said. They pointed to warnings in today’s report that some of those working on the project had developed a ‘fortress mentality’ and ‘a 'good news' reporting culture’, leaving ministers in the dark about any problems. But Labour will demand that Mr Duncan Smith comes to the Commons to explain why the project has gone so badly off course. The scheme, which will replace a string of out-of-work benefits, is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours . He is likely to be asked why he continued to issue public assurances that the scheme was on track when senior officials across Whitehall were privately warning him of ‘serious concerns’. In a withering assessment, today’s report says: ‘Throughout the programme the DWP has lacked a detailed view of how Universal Credit is meant to work. ‘The department was warned repeatedly about the lack of a detailed “blueprint” … for Universal Credit.’ It adds: ‘The department has delayed rolling out Universal Credit to claimants, has had weak control of the programme, and has been unable to assess the value of the systems it spent over £300million to develop.’ The NAO raises wider concerns about the department’s ability to ‘deal with weak programme management, over-optimistic timescales and a lack of openness about progress’. It also says Universal Credit’s IT system ‘lacks a component to identify potentially fraudulent claims’. Liam Byrne, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman said: ‘Mr Duncan Smith swore blind this benefit shake-up was fine. Now we learn he has completely lost control of his department at a potential cost of hundreds of millions of pounds.’ A DWP spokesman said the report did not cover ‘significant’ progress made since April when a former Olympics chief was brought in to ‘reset’ the project.","National Audit Office says Universal Credit is beset by ‘weak management, ineffective control and poor governance’

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Dressed in a fairytale white dress and clutching a bouquet, Kayleigh Duff looks every inch the beautiful bride. But the beaming smile in the happy wedding day pictures hides a sad story. At just 23, Kayleigh is terminally ill with liver cancer – and the ‘marriage’, with a model groom, was arranged by her friends after she listed it as one of the things she wanted to do before she died. Fairytale wedding: Kayleigh Duff, 23, who has liver cancer, has already fulfilled her dying wish of marrying a male model . 'A dream come true': Kayleigh enjoyed a perfect wedding day with with male model Danny Whisker . Kayleigh was devastated when doctors told her last February that a hereditary gene defect had developed into cancer. The same rare condition killed her father Lee at the age of 37 in 1998. Kayleigh started chemotherapy in March and drew up a list of things she would have wanted to do in her life – including getting married. It was her best friend Katie Birch who decided the absence of a current partner in her life need not stand in the way of  her dream. Kayleigh was pampered by hair and make-up artists before being whisked to Whitstable Castle in Kent in a vintage Jaguar. Guests included her mother Beverley Cox, 46, grandparents Sharon, 70, and Ian Day, 71, and Kayleigh’s two-year-old son Kai. And waiting for her was handsome model Danny Wisker, booked for the day to play the role of groom. The big day: Bride Kayleigh (centre) is pictured with son Kai (far left), mother Bey Cox (right) and grandparents Ian (left) and Sharon Day (far right) Kayleigh looked absolutely stunning when she was married at the elegant Whitstable Castle . Guests drank champagne while the ‘bride’ posed for pictures. Kayleigh, from Herne Bay, Kent, said: ‘The groom was so nice and was really handsome. ‘It was a bit awkward at first because obviously it’s a bizarre situation – I couldn’t stop laughing. I didn’t expect any of it, it was mad. 'It really was a dream come true. It was great. The dress was beautiful – it really was. The castle and everything were just beautiful.’ Close bond: Kayleigh, pictured with mother Bey, lost her father Terry to the same cancer she suffers with . Mrs Cox said: ‘It’s been quite overwhelming. It was like it was really happening for her and although it’s not going to be for real, to us it was real and we have got lovely pictures and memories.’ Kayleigh suffers from a hereditary genetic disorder called familial adenomatous polyposis which causes growths on the  large intestine – raising the risk of developing cancer. She was diagnosed with cancer last June and doctors operated on her to remove the growths. A touching moment: Kayleigh and two-year-old son Kai are pictured enjoying a loving kiss . Kayleigh has given up her job a a kitchen assistant to spend as much time as possible with her young son Kai before she dies . But in February, follow-up tests found the illness had spread and medics told her she will never be fully rid of it. They hope to prolong her life with regular chemotherapy. Kayleigh, who has been forced to quit her job as a kitchen assistant, now wants to devote as much time as possible to her son. She said: ‘I take every day as it comes, but most of the time I’m all right.’ Best of friends: Katie Birch (left) organised the entire last minute event for her friend Kayleigh (right)","Kayleigh Duff, from Kent, has been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer .

"By . Tim Shipman . Overhaul: Education Secretary Michael Gove will outline a radical overhaul of GCSEs which will do away with low pass marks and force pupils to take extension papers to get the best grades . Education Secretary Michael Gove today abandoned his ambitious plans to scrap GCSEs, admitting his radical reforms were a 'bridge too far. He instead unveiled an overhaul of the existing exam system, doing away with low pass marks and forcing pupils to take extension papers to get the best grades. The tougher GCSEs will involve single, harder exams at the end of two years of studying, replacing modules at the end of almost every term. But he said the idea of axing GCSEs in favour of new English Baccalaureate Certificates in core academic subjects was 'one reform too many at this time'. And a plan to only allow a single exam board per subject has been dumped, despite previously arguing it was essential to prevent boards 'dumbing down' standards to get more business from schools. Mr Gove told MPs in the Commons: 'I have decided not to make the best the enemy of the good.' He originally wanted to introduce EBCs in England in English, maths, science, foreign languages, history and geography. But the Liberal Democrats opposed the idea of a 'two tier' exam system and imposing rules on exam boards risked falling foul of EU law. Government lawyers advised that the plan would have been allowed in a few subjects – but setting up monopolies across the board would have led to exam boards suing the Government if they were put out of business. Labour;s Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, said: 'The words ""GCSE"" and ""fiasco"" seem to be indelibly linked under this Government. This is a humiliating climbdown.' The Mail revealed last year that Mr Gove planned to abolish GCSES and bring back O-levels in core subjects along with a practical CSE-style exam. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who had not been briefed on the plans, demanded that all pupils should sit the same exam. He said he did not like the original plan, which he described as 'a two-tier system where you tell one set of kids you are not bright enough to proceed'. And he praised Mr Gove for changing his plans after a consultation. 'He's quite rightly listened and he's going to make a statement today which I think will show parents and teachers that we are as ambitious as ever as a coalition Government for higher, better standards. 'But at the same time to make sure the approach is broad-based, not too narrow, so it encompasses lots of subjects and not just a narrow focus on some of them, and also doesn't already reinvent the wheel,' he said on his LBC radio phone-in. Scroll down for video . Intervention: Mr Gove planned to abolish GCSES and bring back O-levels in core subjects along with a practical CSE-style exam but Lib Dem intervention scuppered the plans . A deal was thrashed out last autumn that would have seen new exams in English, maths and other core subjects. But Mr Gove and his Lib Dem deputy David Laws abandoned the plans after deciding they were an unworkable compromise. Instead, . Mr Gove will today publish a national curriculum for pupils at 16 and . use a statement to the Commons to outline plans to improve GCSEs. Under his proposals, GCSE pass marks – . which can be as low as 30 per cent in some subjects – will be raised so . they are based on the level of knowledge pupils in other countries are . expected to achieve. GCSEs will also have fewer . ‘bite-sized’ questions – blamed for grade inflation – proper essays in . English and history, fewer resits and more restrictions on texts in . exams. Nick Clegg said he had blocked a 'two tier' exam system . Extension papers will also be introduced for pupils expected to achieve top grades, particularly in maths and the sciences. Mr . Gove will issue instructions to exam watchdog Ofqual today and they . will draw up the tougher GCSEs, which will begin for pupils starting . their studies in September 2015. They . will sit the exams in 2017 – one year earlier than planned. Mr Gove is . also tearing up rules for judging success in schools to ensure that . teachers are forced to help pupils of all abilities. Insiders . say the current system of judging how many pupils get five GCSEs graded . A* to C, including English and maths, encourages schools to make . students sit ‘junk’ exams in easy subjects to boost grades. In . future, schools will be judged on the percentage of pupils passing . English and maths and a points system for a pupil’s best eight results – . which must include at least three core subjects such as science, . history, geography and languages. The rethink came after the Commons Education Committee said standards could be raised by improving GCSEs rather than scrapping them. A source close to the committee said: ‘We said that we weren’t convinced that the GCSE brand was broken. ‘It was right to say that exams at 16 needed reform, with a crackdown on resits but you can send a message about grade inflation without coupling exam reform with market reform. I’m glad it seems they have listened.’ Former schools minister Nick Gibb insisted Mr Gove had 'taken the right decision'. 'There is a determination for an aged-16 qualification, the GCSE will be rigorous, it will be on a par with the best in the world,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'There's agreement right across the political spectrum - Labour, Liberal, Conservatives - that there has been grade inflation over the years in the GCSEs and one of the reasons for that has been the competition between exam boards for a market share of scores. 'The plan now is for Ofqual to be rigorous in ensuring we don't have that grade inflation and of course this thing will be kept under review. 'And if the exams board don't reform the way they conduct themselves and start to maintain standards from year-to-year and against the international competition - that's the new objective that Ofqual has, they will now be looking around the world at the best exams and comparing those with the qualifications we have in this country.'","Education Secretary Michael Gove will outline radical overhaul of GCSEs .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For anyone who felt awkward as a teenager and desperately wanted to be popular like the ‘cool kids’ at school, a new study may seem like poetic justice. Scientists have found that teenagers who act cool in early adolescence are more likely to experience a range of problems in early adulthood, compared to their geeky peers. Children who are revered at school, for example, are more likely to have alcohol and drug problems, become involved in crime, and have problems in relationships. Scientists have found that teenagers who act cool in early adolescence - as portrayed in films such as Mean Girls (pictured) - are more likely to experience a range of problems in early adulthood, compared to their geeky peers. These include alcohol and drug problems, committing crimes, and having problems in relationships . Researchers recently claimed that 'cool kids' are just as likely to get bullied as unpopular children - and that the consequences could be greater for them. The study found that the bullying of popular children is an 'invisible crime' as many refuse to acknowledge problems for fear of ruining their standing. They also found becoming more popular both increases the risk of getting bullied, and worsens the negative consequences of being victimised. The University of California, Davis, study found that popular children feel they have further to fall. The study found that the risk of being bullied increases as adolescents climb their school's social ladder - up until they approach the very top, when the risk plummets. The students at the top, approximately the 5 percent most popular kids in school, sit just above the fray, possibly because their extremely high status puts them out of reach of any rivals. According to a decade-long study by researchers at the University of Virginia, cool teens who seek out popularity and attention by acting older their age, may not yield the expected benefits. Such characters are often seen in teen films and are epitomised by James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause and by the four central characters in Mean Girls. Researchers followed 184 teens from age 13, when they were in seventh and eighth grades, to age 23. Along the way they collected information from the teens themselves, as well as from their peers and parents. The teenagers attended public school in suburban and urban areas in the south eastern United States, and were from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. Teens who were romantically involved at an early age, engaged in delinquent activity, and placed a premium on hanging out with physically attractive peers were thought to be popular by their peers at age 13. But over . time, this sentiment faded and by 22, those once-cool teens were rated . as being less competent in managing social relationships, by their once geeky peers.

Such characters are often seen in teen films and are epitomised by James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause (pictured left) They . were also more likely to have had significant problems with alcohol and . drugs and to have engaged in criminal activities, according to the . study. ‘It appears that while so-called cool teens' behaviour might have been linked to early popularity, over time, these teens needed more and more extreme behaviours to try to appear cool, at least to a subgroup of other teens,’ Joseph Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, explained. ‘So they became involved in more serious criminal behaviour and alcohol and drug use as adolescence progressed. These previously cool teens appeared less competent - socially and otherwise - than their less cool peers by the time they reached young adulthood.’","A University of Virginia study tracked 84 teens from age 13 to 23 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A hungry lion cub was dealt a terrible punishment for being too keen to feast on a newly-slain buffalo when he got his head stuck in the creature's backside. In his eagerness to pounce after his 18-strong pride had brought down the beast, the baby became trapped in its rear end, unable to free itself. He thrashes every way possible, flipping himself over and pushing against the carcass with his paws, but none of his efforts pays off. Scroll down for video . Torture chamber: Video taken in a South African national park shows a lion cub desperately trying to free himself from a buffalo's rear end, in which he has trapped himself in his haste to feed after a kill . Indeed, the unfortunate big cat suffers all the more as his exertions cause him to breathe more quickly and deeply than usual. Eventually the speed of the movements slows down, and the cub lies still for several minutes, seemingly unconscious, in footage captured on a visit to Kruger National Park in South Africa. However, even though the cub's fate seemed sealed after his struggles did no good, he appears to have eventually been saved by the efforts of his fellow lions. The other members of the pack, who seem wholly unconcerned during the filmed portion of his five-minute struggle, reportedly decided to save their friend by eating their way through the carcass. Sticky situation: The cub flips itself upside-down and thrashes around with its paws, to no avail . Unconcerned: The lionesses who made the kill seem in no hurry to help the cub free as it pants heavily . Rescue mission? Though not shown in footage, the safari-goers who uploaded the video say they returned the next day to find the cub gone, seemingly freed after the lionesses ate through the carcass . In an explanation added to the video, posted online in 2011, the Youtube user who uploaded the video explained that when they returned the next day the cub had escaped. The pride of lions was nowhere to be seen, but the carcass still bore the marks of what seems to have been a co-ordinated rescue attempt by the surrounding lionesses. The buffalo's carcass had been eaten through,seemingly leaving enough space for the unlucky lion to make good his escape. The user, posting under the name Laliaztlan, said she was 'relieved' that the cub seemed to have been freed.","Unfortunate cub got trapped in felled buffalo in his haste to eat it after hunt .

"By . Jack Doyle . New Scotland Yard: The Met Police's Special Demonstration Squad routinely lied to courts about the actions of its undercover agents, a review has found . Dozens of historic police investigations involving undercover officers are to be re-opened over potential miscarriages of justice. A review has found that the Metropolitan Police’s Special Demonstrations Squad routinely lied to the courts and failed to reveal the involvement of its undercover officers to defence lawyers. The revelations raise the prospect of decades- old cases being revisited. Hundreds of political activists could have their convictions quashed, with animal rights campaigners and protesters from the far Left and Right among those whose charges will now be re-examined. Anyone wrongly jailed could mount a civil compensation claim against the Met. The SDS came under scrutiny over its . alleged involvement in smearing the family of Stephen Lawrence – but a . review by Mark Ellison QC revealed even more worrying allegations in . other cases. He said the . nature of undercover work placed serving officers inside groups of . activists who came into conflict with the police and faced arrest and . prosecution. He added that a . system where this activity was ‘shrouded in almost total secrecy’ and . the roles of undercover officers and the intelligence they gathered ‘was . not considered in relation to the prosecution’s duty of disclosure in . criminal proceedings’ produced ‘the potential for there to have been . unfairness in some of those proceedings’. The . Ellison review also found ‘inevitable potential for SDS officers to . have been viewed by those they infiltrated as encouraging, and . participating in, criminal behaviour.’ As a result ‘there is a real . potential for miscarriages of justice to have occurred’, Home Secretary . Theresa May said. Mr Ellison will now review cases involving the unit, which could then be referred to the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve. Mrs . May told the Commons that the SDS, which was set up by the Home Office . in 1968, had operated ‘as if exempt from the proper rules of disclosure . in criminal cases’, and used an ‘extraordinary level of secrecy’ to . protect undercover officers’ identities. This included failing to reveal their true identities in court. In Stephen’s murder investigation, an undercover officer, referred to as N81, was found to have held a meeting with acting detective inspector Richard Walton, who had been seconded to the team making submissions to the Macpherson Inquiry. Mr Ellison branded this meeting ‘a completely improper use’ of intelligence, adding: ‘We find the opening of such a channel of communication at that time to have been wrong-headed and inappropriate.’ He continued: ‘The mere presence of an undercover Metropolitan Police officer in the wider Lawrence family camp in such circumstances is highly questionable in terms of the appearance it creates of the [Met] having a spy in the family’s camp.’ Doreen Lawrence, mother of Stephen Lawrence, leaves the Home Office with her son Stuart Lawrence, after meeting with Theresa May last June. They were spied on by an undercover officer as they fought for justice . Mrs May has now announced that corrupt police officers will face longer jail terms as part of a new misconduct offence. She outlined measures designed to restore trust in the police, which she admitted was ‘damaged’ by the latest revelations. Mrs May told the Commons that the findings of the Ellison review were ‘deeply concerning’ and stressed it was ‘imperative that public trust and confidence in the police is maintained’. She said: ‘I do not believe corruption and misconduct to be endemic in the police, and it is clear that the majority of policemen and women conduct themselves honestly and with integrity.’ However, she admitted: ‘In policing as in other areas, the problems of the past have a danger of infecting the present, and can lay traps for the future. Policing stands damaged today. ‘Trust and confidence in the Metropolitan Police, and policing more generally, is vital. A public inquiry, and the other work I have set out, are part of the process of repairing the damage.’ In memory: Mark Ellison QC called a  meeting between the officer spying on the Lawrence family and an officer on to the team making submissions to the Macpherson Inquiry 'a completely improper use' of intelligence . A new offence of police misconduct will replace the existing common law offence of misconduct in public office. This comes with a maximum sentence of life, but is rarely used. The new law will reflect the importance of maintaining trust in the police – and the serious consequences of police corruption. Mrs May said the current rules are ‘outdated’ and the new offence will be ‘focused clearly on those who hold police powers’. It could become law within months. The Home Secretary has also ordered a review of police forces’ standards departments, to ensure they are capable of investigating lower-level complaints. The Independent Police Complaints Commission will be given an extra £15million and the power to probe all serious complaints, instead of leaving forces to investigate their own.  Mrs May said the watchdog was being ‘expanded and emboldened so it will have responsibility for dealing with all serious and sensitive cases’.","Review finds Met's undercover unit failed to reveal its involvement to courts .

"By . Katy Winter . A part-time model who had a £4,800 breast enlargement at taxpayers' expense has said she now wants the implants removed, and is expecting the NHS to foot the bill once more. Josie Cunningham, 23, has said rather than improving her life her . breast enhancement surgery has left her feeling self-conscious and has . led to bullying, so she wants them removed. The aspiring model hit the headlines earlier this year when she had her breasts increased from a 32A to 36DD on the NHS as she said she was being bullied for her smaller cleavage. Scroll down for video . Josie had her £4,800 breast enlargement surgery on the NHS in January but now wants her chest reduced . Josie says that although she hoped the operation would help her career, she has found that her bigger breasts have made her self-conscious. Pictured left, Josie before the enhancement and, right, after . Despite appearing in numerous publications to show off her new bustier look, the mother-of-two is now claiming that her new curves are preventing her from finding work. Speaking to Closer magazine Josie, from Leeds, says: ‘They’re so big I find them embarrassing and I don’t feel I can do any modelling because they’ve attracted so much negative attention.. I’m thinking about having a reduction on the NHS. ‘I’m looking into charities that could help, but I think it’s down to the NHS because they made them so big,’ she argues. Not totally oblivious to the plight of many who wait months on NHS waiting lists due to lack of budgets, Josie says of her use of taxpayer money: ’I feel awful when I hear about people in need who are refused treatment, but I don’t decide who the NHS helps.’ 'There’s a queue and we’re all in it together. If it was my child that was ill I’d move heaven and earth, like any parent, but I don’t make the rules.' The case caused outrage last month after it was revealed the NHS had funded Josie's operation while just a few miles away two-year-old Oliver Dockerty, who suffers from cerebral palsy, had been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him to walk. At the time his mother Claire said: 'Oliver has splints on his legs, a flexi-stand as he hasn’t got any balance, and uses a walking frame to get around. Josie has previously flaunted her new breasts and even used this outfit to offer a tribute to the NHS for paying for her implants . Josie's two hour operation was performed after a seven month wait, and took her from a 32A to a 36DD cup . 'He wants to be jumping in muddy puddles like Peppa Pig. He wants to be kicking a football and he can’t jump on a trampoline. I’d love to see him walking unaided for his first day at primary school. 'I’m a single parent and I don’t have that kind of money. Even if they look again at the decision, there’s going to be a big backlog of children like Oliver waiting to have this done.' The full interview is available in this weeks Closer . After the story appeared in the Daily Mail a deluge of support from readers contributed to the £24,000 raised in just one day on a fundraising web page set up for Oliver. Following the operation, hoping her new bust line would help her dream career as a glamour model, Josie went to the media with her story,  but found herself at the receiving end of abuse. She claims she was taunted trough social media and even shouted at down the street with people demanding their money back. ‘I don’t want to spend my life known as the girl with the massive NHS boobs, so having smaller implants is the only option,’ she says. Josie was granted the initial breast surgery as she had a congenial medical condition which meant she had no breast tissue. The part-time retail assistant was bullied from the age of 16 for her flat chest and said her breast didn’t even grow during her two pregnancies. Placed on a waiting list in 2012, Josie had the two-hour operation seven months later at St James’s Hospital in Leeds. She said: 'People don't understand that I deserved the surgery. 'I was born without breast tissue. I'm as worthy  as anyone else. And I thought working as a model would be a good way of paying back into the system through tax.' However, she now hopes to re-join a waiting list for surgery to have the implants removed. Unsurprisingly her story has caused upset, particularly as a drive to cut an additional £20 billion from the NHS budget has recently been announced. Chief executive of the tax payers alliance Matthew Sinclair says: ‘It is ridiculous that taxpayers paid for this surgery in the first place.’ Read the full interview with Josie in this weeks Closer magazine, on sale today, or on www.closeronline.co.uk Video courtesy of ITV Daybreak .","Josie, 23, had £4,800 surgery on the NHS in January .

"By . Alice Smellie . The latest fitness trends rely on teamwork and involve warrior dances, intense high-leg-kicking martial arts moves – or simply going for a roll around with your dog. Most surprising is the unstoppable rise in popularity  of team activities involving mud, obstacles and monkey bars – reminiscent of the ones we  tried to dodge at school. Here, Leonardo DiCaprio’s personal trainer Cornel Chin and  Mail on Sunday fitness columnist Gillian Reeves give their verdicts on which workouts everyone will be talking about  (if not actually doing) in 2014. Doggy style: Fitness camps where your pet is involved is one of the new fitness trends for 2014 . WORK OUT WITH  YOUR PORKY POOCH . WHAT IS IT? Nubeginnings  Paw Camp – a boutique fitness camp for you and your dog. Specialist trainers and boot camps are now available for dogs and their owners. This one offers healthy-eating lessons (for your dog), sports massage (for your dog), obstacle courses and hiking (for you both). ‘Working out with dogs kills two birds with one stone,’ says Victoria Wills, founder of the Nubeginnings residential course. ‘A little canine company and encouragement is excellent for humans who aren’t keen on a training regime.’ BENEFITS: The RSPCA suggests it is more likely that obese owners have obese dogs. Health risks  are the same for both, including diabetes and heart disease. ‘It depends on the level of exercise taken, but even a brisk walk increasing the heart rate is good for you and your pet,’ says Chin. WHO IS IT FOR? All dog owners. WHERE? nubeginnings.co.uk.  The next Paw Camp is in February. Work out at home: Slim In Six programme . TONE AND TRIM WITHOUT LEAVING HOME . WHAT IS IT? Slim In Six is an  at-home workout which claims you’ll get in shape in . six weeks. ‘The trend for at-home workouts shows no sign of abating,’ says Chin. ‘Slim In Six is huge in the US and taking off here. There are . three separate sections: Start it Up, Ramp it Up and Burn it Up. You . start with a low-intensity workout for 30 minutes a day with leg and arm . lifts, moving on to bottom, hips and thighs toning with squats and . lunges at speed. If you want to kick-start a healthy lifestyle, this is a . fantastic at-home starter.’ BENEFITS: Cardiovascular workout, weight loss and toning – at home. WHO IS IT FOR? ‘Suitable . for most levels of fitness, but take medical advice beforehand. You . need to be motivated, but knowing it’s within a short time-frame will . help,’ says Chin. Great for those on a budget or short of time. WHERE? beachbody.co.uk, £66.80 . THE POST-FONDA WORKOUT . WHAT IS IT? Burn 360 is a new all-over body-conditioning workout moving away from the Jane Fonda ‘bums and tums’ classes of the 1980s and 1990s. ‘Burn 360 is based around stretching out all the tissue that surrounds and connects muscles,’ says Reeves (the class’s creator). ‘It gives definition and muscle tone as well as improving posture. 'The class starts with a stretching warm-up for the entire body, then focuses on different parts. Expect to find yourself doing body-weight exercises to strengthen wrists, shoulders and core. The aim is to move the body in all directions so that niggling injuries generally caused by our sedentary, desk or chair-bound lifestyles can be avoided.’ BENEFITS: ‘Stretching is the best way of toning,’ says Chin. ‘Elongating muscles makes them look and feel toned.’ WHO IS IT FOR? Suitable for all levels – but this is not a cardiovascular workout. WHERE? virgin.co.uk . DISCOVER YOUR INNER WARRIOR . WHAT IS IT? Fierce, the African dance-inspired class. Reeves says: ‘Set to tribal rhythms, it’s an overall body workout with natural and bold movements that work the major muscle groups. It’s also great fun.’ BENEFITS: Squatting, swinging and warrior-style kicking make this brilliant for toning legs, thighs and bottom.  Rhythmic stamping and pounding music are exhilarating, so it’s also great for stress-relief. ‘Most dance-orientated exercise has excellent cardiovascular benefits,’ says Chin. WHO IS IT FOR? ‘Everyone from beginner to professional,’ says Reeves, who adds that the class is as sociable as  Zumba and great for losing inhibitions. Fierce creator Teva Scarborough adds: ‘A lot of people believe they can’t dance if they are unable to perform the moves perfectly. If you look at traditional tribal cultures, everyone is involved in the dancing.’ WHERE? virginactive.co.uk, from this month . Do it jungle style: The new dance class Fierce at Virgin Active gyms is inspired by African tribal dancing . BESPOKE TEAM CLASSES . WHAT IS IT? Virgin Active’s latest piece of gym-floor kit, the Technogym Omnia, billed as ‘a revolutionary  Group Training Solution’. Capitalising on the success of their ‘Fast’ classes –15-minute trainer-led group exercise sessions in the main gym which can be dipped in and out  of by anyone – the Omnia is basically  a machine that up to eight people can use simultaneously. Each user stands at a station which can be fitted with different attachments that are pushed, pulled, twisted or manipulated in other ways. Some exercises use weights attached to pulleys, other require body weight only. BENEFITS: Instructor-led classes work strength, endurance, stability, flexibility, co-ordination and speed with toning  and some cardiovascular benefits. ‘Resistance training is excellent,’ says Chin. ‘It builds endurance, stamina, strength and body toning.’ WHO IS IT FOR? Suitable for all  levels of fitness. WHERE? virgin.co.uk . NO OBSTACLE TO FITNESS . WHAT IS IT? Obstacle race courses for adults. ‘People have moved on from triathalons and want something even tougher now,’ says Chin. According to muddyrace.co.uk, last year there were 70 of these Ironman-type events across the UK that involved 200,000 entrants running three or six-mile courses, clambering over walls and obstacles along the way. The RockSolidRace in Exeter on March 15 is  a good example – you’ll plough through mud, swamp and water. BENEFITS: An all-round cardiovascular and strength-building workout. Train with moves such as pull-ups and press-ups,  or circuit classes at the gym. WHO IS IT FOR? If you fancy yourself  as a bit of a part-time action hero, and think marathons are for wimps, then these are the races for you. WHERE? muddyrace.co.uk .

"By . William Turvill . Christians should challenge the greed and selfishness behind poverty, the Archbishop of Canterbury said in his first Christmas Day sermon. Addressing a congregation at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said: ‘Even in a recovering economy, Christians, the  servants of a vulnerable and poor saviour, need to act to serve and love the poor.’ The Archbishop, who was installed in March, cited a poll that suggested the Church was more trusted on politics than religion, saying: ‘The two  cannot be separated. No  society can be content where misery and want exist, unless, through our love collectively, we also challenge the greed and selfishness behind it.’ Scroll down for video... Entrance: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby arrives for Christmas Day Mass at Cantebury Cathedral . Message: Mr Welby called on Christians to 'challenge the causes of poverty', despite signs of an economic recovery in the UK . Mr Welby, who was enthroned as leader of the 77 million-strong Anglican community in March, condemned the treatment of Christian communities in the Middle East who are being ‘attacked and massacred’ and the ongoing suffering in South Sudan. ‘We see injustice in the ever more seriously threatened Christian communities of the Middle East,’ he said. ‘They are attacked and massacred, driven into exile from a region in which their presence has always been essential. ‘We see terrible news in South Sudan, where political ambitions have led towards ethnic conflict. On Saturday I was speaking to a bishop under siege, in a compound full of the dying. ‘We see injustices at home,’ he added. Celebration: Mr Welby prays during the Christmas Day Mass at Canterbury Cathedral . ‘Even in a recovering economy, Christians, the servants of a vulnerable and poor saviour, need to act to serve and love the poor; they need also to challenge the causes of poverty.’ Mr Welby, who launched a crusade against payday lenders earlier this year, cited a poll in Prospect magazine which suggested the church is more trusted on politics than religion, before adding: ‘The two cannot be separated’. ‘Christ's birth is not politics, it is love expressed,' he said. ‘Our response is not political, but love delivered in hope. The action of the churches in the last five years is extraordinary, reaching out in ways not seen since 1945. He condemned people's treatement in South Sudan, where 'political ambitions have led to ethnic conflict' Mr Welby, who was enthroned in March, will deliver his speech at Canterbury Cathedral today . ‘Yet no society can be content where misery and want exist, unless through our love collectively we also challenge the greed and selfishness behind it.’ The Archbishop, who has more than 48,000 followers on Twitter, had earlier posted a Christmas video message on the photo-sharing website Instagram. In the message, he said: ‘Christmas means that, through Jesus, God shows unconditionally that he loves us. I pray that he gives you a very blessed Christmas.’","Justin Welby called on Christians to 'challenge the causes of poverty'

Scroll down for video - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Tara the cat, who saved Jeremy, four, from a vicious dog attack that was caught on camera, threw the first pitch at a minor league baseball game . Yesterday Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born. She followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said. On Thursday, Jeremy snoozed his way through his first live interview on the Today show as his parents described their shock at Tara's act of bravery. 'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat . take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo said. 'That dog did not . even know what hit him.' Erica explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the neighbor's dog, an eight-month-old male Labrador-Chow mix, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg. 'I'd never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.'

In an interview with the Bakersfield Californian, . his family said she had always been protective over their oldest child . and slept in his crib when he was a baby. They also have younger twin . boys. They added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, even though Erica is allergic to cats. She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said. They named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means driftwood. 'We named her driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Some popular antidepressants could double the risk of a child being born with a heart defect if an expectant mother takes them in early pregnancy, an expert has warned. Professor Stephen Pilling,  of drug rationing body National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), believes the risk is such that they are not worth taking for women with mild to moderate depression. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, have been used in up to one in six women of child bearing age. Some popular antidepressants could double the risk of a child being born with a heart defect if an expectant mother takes them in early pregnancy, an expert has warned . The risk of a baby being born with a . heart defect is around two in 100, the BBC reports. But Professor Pilling said evidence suggests if a mother took an SSRI in early pregnancy the risk increases to around . four in 100. The risk of a baby being born with a heart defect is around two in 100. Evidence suggests if a mother took an SSRI in early pregnancy the risk increases to around four in 100 . The Panorama programme has spoken to eight mothers who had babies born with serious heart defects. All of them had taken a commonly used SSR antidepressant while pregnant. While prescription guidelines only warn specifically against giving women the SSRI, paroxetine, in early pregnancy,  Professor Pilling, has said that advice is about to be updated, as available evidence 'suggests there is a risk'. He said: 'We make a quite a lot of effort really to discourage women from smoking or drinking even small amounts of alcohol in pregnancy, and yet we're perhaps not yet saying the same about antidepressant medication, which is going to be carrying similar - if not greater - risks.' He said Nice guidance will be revised to take into account that the group of antidepressants are 'linked to heart defects.' He added that women not suffering from the most severe depression who become pregnant whilst taking the drug are taking an 'unnecessary risk'. Lundbeck, the manufacturer of one of the SSRIs, Citalopram, told the BBC a recent review of scientific literature concluded the drug 'does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of major foetal malformations'. They warned not prescribing the drug to a depressed woman could generate greater risks to her and her baby that the medication itself.","SSRIs antidepressants are used in up to 1 in 6 women of child-bearing age .

"A sick little girl is being kept alive thanks to her best friend – a dog who carries her oxygen tank on her back. Alida Knobloch’s faithful canine companion Mr Gibbs has been specially trained to shepherd the three-year-old, who breathes though a tube most of the time. He follows her closely as she plays in her family's ten-acre land in Louisville, Georgia, uses the slide or even rides her bike. Scroll down for video . Faithful friend:Alida Knobloch, who breathes through a tube, with dog Mr Gibbs who carries her oxygen tank . Alida, who was diagnosed with neuroendocrine hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) when she was just eight months old, is able to breathe without the tube. But it is very difficult for her and Mr Gibbs is on hand for when she needs the oxygen. It also means she can move around without having to carry the heavy canister herself. Often the pair move about in tandom as she plays while breathing through the tube and he runs alongside her. 'My best dog': The toddler cuddles Mr Gibbs at her home in Louisville, Georgia . The tubes can be reinserted into the tank . if they come out. But it is not that easy for a toddler to do and her . parents prefer them to be removed only when they are close to hand. Her rare condition was only discovered in 2005 and has just 800 documented sufferers worldwide, it causes diseased pieces of the lungs to filter oxygen through extra layers of cells making it hard or almost impossible to breathe. For Alida, and her parents Aaron and Debbie Knobloch, it meant that even a walk in the park was very difficult because equipment was too heavy for the youngster to be able to carry herself. As parents they wanted to do something to help their daughter navigate life despite having a tube trailing her at all times. The couple found out about 'service dogs' from a TV programme and realised an animal trained to help the blind could be trained to help Alida. They found help in the shape of golden doodle - a retriever crossed with a poodle - dog Mr Gibbs and even moved 2,000 miles from their native Utah so Alida and Mr Gibbs could be together. The family realised there was a long waiting list for service dogs and didn't want to take one away from someone else who might need it more on the list. Now - thanks to trainer Ashleigh Kinsley - Alida and Mr Gibbs love nothing more than playing and running around together with the dog literally acting as Alida's life saver. Alida loves Mr Gibbs so much she said: ‘He's my best dog.’ By her side: Mr Gibbs beside Alida at Disneyland . Always around: Mr Gibbs follows Alida down a slide as she momentarily breathes without her oxygen tubes . Family: Mr Gibbs and Alida with her parents Aaron and Debbie Knoblach and her baby sister . Mrs Knobloch, 39, a nurse, said Alida and Mr Gibbs were growing up together and learning all the time. She . said: ‘Alida never complains about her condition, at the moment we she . does have a habit of trying to pull out her tubes though, we have to . tell her that's not a good idea. ‘She loves Mr Gibbs and he loves her too. We're trying to make life easier for her and she's just now starting to realise she's different, but as the bond between her and Gibbs gets stronger, we think things will get better. ‘As a pair they do work well together, Mr Gibbs has the oxygen tank on his back and then Alida has his leash.’ Loving: Alida, who suffers from  a rare condition called neuroendocrine hyperplasia of infancy, has learned to rely on Mr Gibbs, who - in turn - has become a doting and attentive dog . Trip: Alida and Mr Gibbs on a family holiday to Florida where they were dwarfed by a giant Woody toy, right . Having fun: Alida, who was diagnosed with the condition at age eight months, lies on the floor with Mr Gibbs . Mrs Knobloch said Alida was born premature and when they first brought her home she was given oxygen as a precaution. Canine companion: Alida and Mr Gibbs are rarely apart . She . said: ‘She was on oxygen just to make sure she would make it through, . but by eight months doctors became worried she still needed it. ‘It . was then that they told us she had NEHI, it's so rare that it was only . discovered in 2005 and there have been only 800 cases worldwide. ‘There is some good news because the damaged tissue in Alida's lungs is not growing so as her lungs grow and the healthy tissue increases we've been told that eventually she may be able to do without the oxygen during the day. ‘Alida knows she is different, she calls the oxygen her 'O' and she tells us if needs more because she can feel if she is getting low. ‘Mr Gibbs is still a young dog and obviously Alida is still too young to give him too many commands but the pair of them are growing up together.’ Mrs Knobloch is now working with the chiLD foundation charity to raise $30,000 to help families both in the US and the UK with research into the new disease. Dad Aaron said: ‘We're trying to provide some independence for her, and then, after we saw this programme on TV, we thought, 'What about a service animal?'. ‘He's still learning, he's very much a puppy in some ways, playful and gangly. But when he wears the vest, he's all business and does really well, even in public.’ ‘We have to train him to follow Alida's directions, he follows our instructions, but getting him to listen to a three-year-old is harder. But he's getting used to her.’ Happy: Mr Gibbs gives Alida hope despite the incredible hardship she must endure . Every order the family gives, Alida has been taught to echo, and the dog is starting to accept her as his charge, the pair even managed to negotiate the crowds on a recent family holiday to Disney World. The family is currently raising funds for research into NEHI.

"By . David Mccormack . Dust of your tuxedos and ballgowns because the good times are back once again - or at least for employees at Goldman Sachs. Prior to the global economic meltdown in 2007, the investment bank’s annual dinners were lavish affairs when the banking behemoth spoiled its most profitable bankers and their partners. These parties were mothballed following the financial crisis when many banks were bailed out using taxpayer’s dollars and bankers were encouraged to show some modesty and not flaunt their massive bonuses while other people were having their homes repossessed. 'The Golden Globes of Investment Banking': Goldman Sachs has re-introduced lavish parties after celebrating massive quarterly profits . One lucky guest was Instagram user Shannon Kelly who posted several photos of the gala . Now the good times are undoubtedly back at Goldman after the company posted a $2.9 billion quarterly profit earlier this year. That handsome return was enough to encourage the powers-at-be at the bank that they had been modest too long and the time was right for a return to the excess of yesteryear. At the beginning of last month the company flew it’s top 450 bankers and their partners from all around the globe to New York for a business meeting and then a night of revelry. The black-tie gala was held at Pier 36, an exclusive event space on Manhattan's Lower East Side and as these images show it was a lavish affairs for all those lucky enough to have been invited.

"By . Bianca London . The world’s first sensory restaurant for babies, which aims to encourage healthy eating from a young age, has opened its doors today. With the aim of helping mothers and fathers . introduce their little ones to healthy eating habits early on, the Weeny Weaning Restaurant aims to help . families make mealtimes fun through sensory play and expert advice. The restaurant in Clapham features a dedicated sensory area where mini diners are encouraged to play and explore before taking their seats to tuck in. Scroll down for video . World first: Created by Ella's Kitchen, the world's first sensory restaurant for babies opened its doors today for little diners . 'If you can involve your little ones in the food preparation process, such as giving them veggies and fruits to play with, it will make them more engaged from the start,' explained  Consultant Infant Nutritionist Claire Baseley. 'Letting them see, touch and smell the food will make them feel involved and in return they will be more likely to try new tastes.' Babies are then encouraged to try new flavours, in order to encourage them to discover and accept new foods and tastes, in the 'taste zone'. Little ones will be seated in highchairs at interactive tables, from which they will be able to choose from their very own digital menu, allowing them to select their own mains and desserts. Creators say that the colourful interactive menu features state-of-the-art technology, designed to be ideal for little fingers to tap and touch. Opening up: The Weeny Weaning restaurant, as it's called, is located in Clapham and aims to help little diners explore their tastebuds in an interactive way . Playtime: Little diners will explore a variety of dedicated sensory areas, before finishing their sensory restaurant journey in the 'taste zone', where they can order using an interactive menu . 'The interactive menu is another great . way of generating that important sensory engagement, by using visuals of . fruit and vegetables to introduce babies to the ingredients they are . about to munch on. 'They are able to look at colours and shapes and . engage their senses visually, which will make them more excited about new . shapes, textures and foods they try,' said Claire. Depending on the number of times they tap a particular food icon over a 30-second period, the digital menu responds accordingly and the waiters bring the children their selected choice of food, which has been developed with advice from child nutritionists. Speaking about the new restaurant, Claire, who worked on the menu, added: 'We understand that mums and dads sometimes find mealtimes tricky, and that it can take quite a few tries to familiarise any hungry little ones with a new taste or texture. 'We also know that by introducing little ones’ taste buds to a wide variety of different and exciting tastes, it can help encourage them to grow up to be good little eaters. 'That’s why it’s super important to try to introduce little ones to new foods, especially savoury vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, every day during the first weeks of weaning. How does it work? 'If you can involve your little ones in the food preparation process, such as giving them veggies and fruits to play with, it will make them more engaged from the start,' explained Consultant Infant Nutritionist Claire Baseley . 'We hope our sensory restaurant encourages lots of little ones to try tastes and textures they may not have experienced before, and gives parents plenty of ideas and suggestions for fun ways to excite little ones’ senses and make mealtimes fun at home.' Paul Lindley, Ella’s Dad and founder of Ella’s Kitchen, who are behind the restaurant, said: 'Since I set up Ella’s Kitchen, our mission has been to help create healthy relationships with food for little ones. 'The very first tastes babies try when starting out on the weaning journey are so important, so it’s our aim to make this experience as easy and enjoyable as possible for both parents and little ones. 'That’s why we’re delighted to open this innovative weeny weaning restaurant, which helps babies get used to trying lots of delicious new flavours in a really fun, sensorial way.'","Weeny Weaning Restaurant opened doors today in Clapham .

"By . Dan Bloom . With a spaceship-like array of dials controlling everything from tyre circumference to wing flaps, Formula 1 cars have changed a lot in 46 years. It was once a raw sport of man and car, as world champion Graham Hill's vehicle proves. The racing legend's 1968 Lotus 49B will be sold tomorrow for an estimated £1million - despite having just 10 simple instruments on a dashboard which could almost pass for a family saloon's, alongside an ordinary-looking gearstick. A simple sport of man and car: Racing legend Graham Hill's 1968 Lotus 49B will be sold tomorrow for £1million - despite having just 10 instruments on its dashboard . A lot changes in 46 years! Nowadays all the controls are on the steering wheel - which looks like a spaceship cockpit. Last month Sauber explained its controls (pictured) The enigmatic driver, whose son Damon Hill also conquered the world of Formula 1, was the reigning world champion when he took delivery of the Lotus 49B in 1968 - hence the number one on its body. The car’s predecessor, the Lotus 49, had already set a new benchmark for performance and handling when it was unveiled the previous year. Only 12 Lotus 49s were ever built, and the iconic car - which has come up for sale for the first time since the 1970s - is one of only a handful still in existence. Graham Hill and his famous moustache raced the 49B in the Tasman Championship in early 1969, notching up two second places and finishing fourth in the Australian Grand Prix in Brisbane. Later that year Hill raced it in front of a home crowd at the British Grand Prix, finishing seventh. The car boasted a 400bhp V8 engine and a top speed of more than 180mph - figures which sound tame compared to modern F1 cars but had world-beating potential at the time. Its interior was certainly simpler than modern racers. Over the last 46 years, F1 controls have gradually migrated to the steering wheel, which now contains almost every function a driver could ever need. Magnificent: In accordance with F1 tradition, the Lotus 49B carried the number one on its body in honour of its driver Graham Hill, who was the reigning world champion . Only 12 Lotus 49s were ever built, and the iconic car - which has come up for sale for the first time since the 1970s - is one of only a handful still in existence . Pristine: Kept for its entire post-racing history by the collector John Dawson-Damer, the car still bears the name of its driver in large print and looks as it did in 1968 . Golden age: Impressive though it is, the car's lack of advanced controls and gadgets harks back to a simpler age of motor racing, a raw game of man and machine . A thing of beauty: Auctioneers at Bonhams claimed the car, which will be sold tomorrow, is one of the 10 most exquisite designs ever to grace a Formula 1 track . Teams have spent millions developing . their controls to make them easy for drivers to press, and most of the . F1 competitors keep the fine details of their steering wheels a . closely-guarded trade secret. But . one team, Sauber, released a detailed breakdown of how its steering . wheel works this year - and it features more than 25 buttons, dials, . switches and lights. BUILT: 1968RACED UNTIL: Early 1970sENGINE: 400bhp V8TOP SPEED: 180mphWORTH: £1million . The functions include performance maps, rear wing flaps and even a tool to change the circumference of the wheel while driving. There is a pit limiter, which reduces the car's speed when it needs quick maintenance, and a button to contact the pit team to warn them of a stop one lap ahead. After being raced by Hill, the 49B was sold to Swedish racer Joakim Bonnier for the remainder of the 1969 season. The following year it passed to South African driver Dave Charlton, who drove it to two South African F1 wins, before it was retired into the hands of collector John Dawson-Damer shortly afterwards. He restored it to its former glory, saying it was his favourite of 15 classic cars he owned. The 49B is expected to fetch £700,000 to £1million when it is sold at the Goodwood Festival of Speed near Chichester, West Sussex. Tomorrow's sale has a note of sad irony to it, as Mr Dawson-Damer was killed at the wheel of his Lotus 63 when it crashed at Goodwood 14 years ago. Glory: Graham Hill racing the Lotus a few months after he was named world champion in 1968. Sadly it would not help him to victory - he finished eighth . Vintage: The same car being raced later in its career. It will be auctioned with a price tag of up to £1m at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where its owner died . Simpler days: Almost 50 years old, the Formula 1 car was less streamlined than its modern successors, with the rivets visible and not an adjustable wing flap in sight . Like father like son: Graham Hill (left) won two Formula 1 world championships in 1962 and 1968, a feat which would be repeated once by his son Damon (right) in 1996 . The car is being sold by Mr Dawson-Damer's family and its auctioneers described it as one of the 'top 10 groundbreaking F1 designs'. James Knight, director of motoring at Bonhams, said: 'When it first rolled onto the track in 1967 the jaws of all the other competitors dropped. It simply blew its competition out of the water and set a benchmark for performance in F1. 'Lotus’ engineers had found a way to save weight without curtailing performance and handling. They also debuted the Ford Cosworth DFV engine which had never been seen before and went on to notch up so many wins. 'The developments pushed the envelope of what was possible in the sport and it became very clear the future of F1 lay with this design.' Mr Knight added: 'It is the very last car to be sold from the estate of John Dawson-Damer who tragically died in 2000. It was his favourite from a collection of 15 classic cars, most of which were Lotuses. 'It is an extremely rare car with great provenance.' Dynasty: An eight-year-old Damon Hill gets tries on his father's OBE in 1968 . For British racing legend Graham Hill, it was not enough to win the F1 world championship twice - his son would have to win it too. In an industry which has had its share of dynasties, Graham and Damon Hill remain the only father-son pairing ever to both take home the title of World Champion. Born in Hampstead, north London, in 1929, Graham served in the Royal Navy but did not drive a car until the age of 24 - eventually venturing into the world of motor racing and shooting to prominence in the early 1960s. His first World Championship win came in 1962, and it would be six years before he won the title again. From then his racing career saw a gradual decline which ended in tragedy before he could bring himself back into the top spot. Famously, Hill died in November 1975 when he tried and failed to land a plane in freezing fog. The crash killed him alongside five other members of the Embassy Hill team. His death shocked the close-knit world of Formula 1, and the village of Silverstone - home to the track of the same name - now has a road called Graham Hill in his honour. But his legacy would live on in a more prominent way - his son Damon. As a child Damon had watched his father win gong after gong and was just 15 when he died. Young Damon was determined to make a success of himself in the hyper-competitive world of motor racing. Williams team chiefs said they took him on because he was a 'tough b******', and he did not disappoint. Despite facing racing legends of the like of Ayrton Senna, he ascended through the ranks in the early 1990s before eventually claiming the world championship in 1996. He was named the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year and helped his family name go down as one of the most notable in Formula 1 history.","The Lotus 49B was driven by the British world champion in 1968 with just 10 simple instruments on the dashboard .

That's because a group of artists who studied under his tutelage are producing paintings which so closely resemble Kinkade's technique that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart from his original work - except that the new paintings are stamped with the word 'studios' beneath his famous signature. Thomas Kinkade Studios 'continues in the path that Thom himself started and developed,' according to the company's website. The famous artist Thomas Kinkade's signature has been appearing on new paintings, despite his death last year . A group of artists who studied under Kinkade's tutelage are producing paintings which so closely resemble his technique that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart. This painting is by Kinkade . This was painted by the Thomas Kinkade Studios. Since Kinkade's death in April 2012, the artist's company has continued to release works bearing his trademarked signature, with one small addition: the word 'studios.' Rather than reproducing  Kinkade's art, these 'Kinkadian' artists are actually creating new scenes that Kincade never painted by employing his brush and color techniques and focusing, just as he did, on artificial and natural light. 'Thomas Kinkade Studios carries on the Kinkadian tradition to create art that will stand the test of time and be treasured for the ages,' according to the website. Kinkade died in April of 2012 at the age of 54 from a drug and alcohol overdose. Following his death, his widow Nanette Kinkade and girlfriend Amy Pinto fought over the artist's $66 million estate. Kinkade, who had four daughters, started dating Pinto six months after his marriage of 28 years imploded. Kinkade is seen painting the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in New York in 2007 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Keeping your devices safe and secure is a growing problem - from the Heartbleed bug to the NSA, digital security is at the top of the agenda. But now experts believe the solution may lie in quantum computing, which would encrypt our phones and, they claim, make them almost unhackable. Led by Dr. Anthony Laing at the University of Bristol, a team has been working on quantum encoders. Under lock and key: Researchers have developed a quantum encoding machine that could make your phone unhackable, although you'll need to use a 'quantum phone booth' They have been trying to shrink the encoders into more usable sizes. And their latest breakthrough might make quantum encoding a modern security feature. At the moment our internet transactions are secured by public key cryptography. This is an algorithm that requires two keys - one private and one public. While effective, it is susceptible to ‘eavesdropping’ hackers who can then duplicate the keys and get access to secure content. A quantum key, however, cannot be duplicated in the same way, and any attempt to do so destroys the original. Theoretically, this would make codes unbreakable. But while this security measure is desirable, it requires large and bulky equipment to be possible. This equipment is in the form of a server that is used to encode a phone. Dr. Laing and his team have found a way to reduce the size of this server to that of a case of beer. This then sends photons through a fibre-optical capable into a device that is then embedded in your mobile phone. Modern day computers run on a model designed by Alan Turing in the 1930s. They are digital and use 'bits' to transfer information and perform tasks. They use binary code and can only ever been in an active, or an inactive state - running at one or zero. This means that a single bit is either on or off at any one time. The D-Wave quantum computer . Qubits work differently and can be on, off, or in a mixed state in between. As a result, qubits are able to be in . multiple places at the same time. Whereas the original Turing computer can only make one calculation at a time, quantum computers are capable of . performing single tasks faster, and performing multiple tasks more . effectively. Tasks that would take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds using quantum computers like the D-Wave. ‘Large resources such as laser and detectors are situated at the server side, which is accessible via telecom fiber to a client requiring only an on-chip polarization rotator, which may be integrated into a handheld device,’ the researchers write in their paper. ‘This opens the way for quantum enhanced secure communications between companies and members of the general public equipped with handheld mobile devices, via telecom-fiber tethering.’ Inside the device in your phone, photons are altered as they pass through, encrypting any message that is sent. To send texts or make calls securely, you would just need to plug your mobile into the server. It has been likened to an ATM machine, which you’d use with your phone to make, for example, secure financial transactions. Known as quantum cryptography, this feature is being researched further by Nokia and they hope that the technology could soon be making its way to a phone near you. Connecting people: Future Nokia phones could use Quantum cryptography to keep your information safe . The new research could enable our phones to being undergo quantum encoding in future so that we can send secure texts and also make safe financial transactions, according to the researchers .","Quantum computing could be used to make codes unbreakable .

"By . Jason Groves . and Ian Drury . and Matt Chorley . A surprise promise by David Cameron to rule out further defence cuts unravelled today, with Downing Street forced to admit spending will not rise until after 2016. Travelling in Algeria, the Prime Minister told reporters military spending would rise in real terms after 2015. But Defence Secretary Philip Hammond today insisted the promise was only that equipment spending would rise by one per cent a year, but other areas would be cut. David Cameron pictured in Algiers, Algeria today as a Government source indicated that he was keen to veto fresh cuts to avoid throwing the MoD into financial turmoil . Mr Cameron visits the Monument des Martyrs to pay his respects in the wake of the hostage crisis which claimed the lives of at least three Britons . Downing Street today scrambled to clear up the confusion, insisting Mr Cameron's was a Tory party election pledge for beyond 2016. However, in the imminent spending review for 2015-16, only the equipment budget would be protected. During a historic trip to Algeria, the Prime Minister sought to quell a mounting backlash from Tory MPs and military top brass. The turmoil came as the Ministry of Defence’s finances were once again . called into question by the National Audit Office, Britain’s spending . watchdog. In Algeria Mr Cameron said he was keen to veto fresh cuts to avoid throwing the MoD into fresh financial turmoil. An insider said the Prime Minister has not gone back on ‘anything he has said in the past about defence spending’. Mr Cameron, who recently warned about a ‘generational struggle’ against Al Qaeda in the Sahara region, is the first serving British prime minister to visit Algeria since it gained independence in 1962. In 2010, the Ministry of Defence was ordered to cut £4.7billion – or 8 per cent – from its budget. But speaking at the time, Mr Cameron promised ‘year on year real-terms growth in the defence budget in the years beyond 2015’. The PM's decision to ringfence the defence budget sets the scene for a bloody Cabinet battle over the 2015-16 spending review . George Osborne has already agreed . that the MoD’s equipment budget should rise by 1 per cent a year every . year from 2015 to 2020. Mr Hammond appeared to row back on PM's pledge to protect defence spending in interviews this morning. 'I think what the Prime Minister was . referring to was the pledge that was made – which Treasury ministers . have repeated – that the equipment plan, the part of the defence budget . which funds equipment, will rise by 1% a year in real terms after 2015,' he told Sky News. 'And the Treasury has re-confirmed that commitment since the announcements in the Autumn Statement. 'So as far as the equipment plan is . concerned – and that’s what we’re talking about today in this . publication – we’re confident that the funding will be there through to . the end of the decade.' Kevan Jones, Labour’s shadow armed forces minister, said: 'Our forces deserve honesty. Cameron’s spinning is now unravelling. 'Our forces don’t want jam tomorrow and P45s today. They will judge ministers on their record. 'More cuts may be made to fund the shaky equipment plan and claims to have balanced the budget are woefully hollow.' The Chancellor has announced that he wants to make a further £10billion cuts across Whitehall. The move comes days after it was announced that a third round of 5,300 Army redundancies will be made in June. The gas facility in Amenas where International and Algerian hostages were killed in a terrifying ordeal . Mr Hammond will today publish the department’s long-awaited equipment plan explaining how it would spend £160billion over the next decade on buying and maintaining military hardware such as submarines, warships, fighter jets and attack helicopters. But a National Audit Office report on the equipment programme, published simultaneously, warned that the cash-strapped MoD had failed to get to grips with its budget. ‘We have a concern that there are still areas of risk to affordability,’ it said. It pointed to an internal MoD review which concluded that the equipment plan faced a £12.5billion shortfall.","Cameron said military spending would rise in real terms after 2015 .

"By . Vanessa Allen . Andy Coulson was not at the News of the World on the day a phone hacker claims he played him an incriminating voicemail from Sienna Miller, it was claimed yesterday. Lawyers for the former Downing Street communications chief told a court he was not in London on the day Dan Evans claims he played him the hacked voicemail in the newspaper’s office. Evans had described how Coulson allegedly listened to the taped message – in which Miss Miller told James Bond star Daniel Craig ‘I love you’ – and then masterminded an elaborate cover-up to hide the fact it was illegally hacked. Claim: Andy Coulson, left, was not in the News of the World office at the time that Dan Evans, right, says he played him a hacked voicemail from Daniel Craig's phone, a court heard today . The journalist has repeatedly told . the phone hacking trial that it was Coulson who told him to make a copy . of the tape, put it in a Jiffy bag and pretend it had been sent to the . paper’s office anonymously. But . Timothy Langdale QC, defending former News of the World editor Coulson, . 46, told Evans: ‘Mr Coulson wasn’t in the office at all that day. ‘He . wasn’t even in London. What do you say to that?’ Evans, 38, appeared to . falter as he admitted he could have made a mistake but insisted the . tape-playing had happened as he described it. He . conceded he could have ‘consistently mis-remembered’ the day in . question but told the Old Bailey: ‘Clearly my recollection hasn’t been . perfect about when it happened, but happen it did.’ In tense courtroom exchanges, Mr Langdale questioned the accuracy of key elements of Evans’s evidence. Affair: The message apparently revealed that Sienna Miller was having an affair with Mr Craig, her co-star in 2004 film Layer Cake . A . second journalist, who supposedly heard the tape with Coulson, was also . away from the office on the day in question, the barrister said. Evans . admits hacking Mr Craig’s phone and told the court he heard a message . from Miss Miller saying: ‘Hi, it’s me, can’t speak, I’m at the  Groucho . with Jude, I love you.’ Evans told the jury the message was left on September 24, 2005 and he played it to Coulson three days later. But . Mr Langdale said Miss Miller, who was going out with Jude Law at the . time, was not at the Groucho Club in London that night. The jury has . heard she was at her sister Savannah’s wedding in the West Country. Evans . also conceded a second message from Miss Miller, left on the phone of . her step-mother Kelly Hoppen, could have been left by her sister. Witness: Jude Law - Ms Miller's boyfriend at the time - gave evidence in the case this week . He . faced lengthy questioning about why Coulson would have listened to an . illegally hacked voicemail about a front page exclusive in the middle of . an open-plan office. Evans said there was a culture of arrogance at the newspaper which meant staff felt ‘untouchable’. Mr . Langdale repeatedly accused him of altering his account and said there . was no call data to support his claims about when he hacked Mr Craig’s . phone. Evans insisted he was telling the truth, saying: ‘Why would I make this up? This isn’t a fun  experience for me.’ He has admitted phone hacking, conspiring to commit misconduct and lying in a witness statement.Evans . has signed a deal with prosecutors under which his co-operation will be . revealed to the judge before he is eventually sentenced.

"By . Nicholas Mcdermott . You might be under the impression that losing weight requires you to spend hours slogging away in the gym. But according to scientists, just one extra minute of brisk activity every day can help burn off unwanted pounds. Researchers monitored the activity of 4,500 adults, and discovered that how often you exercise your heart and lungs matters more than the duration of the workout. They found that several short bursts of exertion had the same effect as longer, but less frequent spells of exercise. Scientists have suggested shorter bursts of exercise can be more effective than long gym sessions . Those short bursts could include taking the stairs instead of the lift, parking further away from the shops and walking, or getting off the bus one stop early. Lead researcher Dr Jessie Fan, from the University of Utah, said: ‘What we learned is that for preventing weight gain, the intensity of the activity matters more than duration. ‘Knowing that even short bouts of brisk activity can add up to a positive effect is really an encouraging message for promoting better health.’ In the study, volunteers wore accelerometers – devices which can accurately measure movement and activity. Participants also had their  body mass index (BMI) recorded. This measures weight in relation to height. Researchers found that, for women, every minute spent in higher-intensity short bouts of activity each day was associated with a BMI reduction  of 0.07. The results showed that one minute of brisk activity each day offset the calorie equivalent of 0.41lb in weight. The scientists explained that this means if a 5ft 5in woman regularly took the stairs at work, she would weigh nearly half a pound less than a woman of the same height who took the lift. The results were similar for men. Scientists say that taking the stairs instead of using lifts can help shift up to half a pound of weight . Each daily minute of higher-intensity activity lowered the likelihood of being obese by 2 per cent for men and 5 per cent for women. But the study found that, on average, the women who were having their movements monitored were less physically active than the men. The report, which was published in the American Journal of Health Promotion, said: ‘Taking the stairs, walking to the store or between errands are choices that can add up and can end up making a positive health difference. ‘The message is: a little more effort can have an important health payback.’ Many British adults fail to reach the NHS guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week, in bouts of ten minutes or more. And most adults in the study who had been attached to the accelerometers did not meet exercise recommendations. But once short bouts of activity were taken into account, men managed to exceed the guidelines, while women came close to meeting them. The scientists claimed that although these short bursts of exercise may not count towards fulfilling the official guidelines, they were still likely to improve people’s overall health. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘This supports what we know about exercise and weight loss. ‘Adults should be doing exercise every week to keep a healthy weight and ward off life-threatening conditions such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes.’ In a separate study published last year, an academic at Aberdeen University suggested that short, sharp bursts of exercise were better at warding off heart disease than longer,  less strenuous sessions. That is because they helped speed up the rate at which fat left the blood. Fat lingering in the blood is known to trigger the first in a series of steps that can lead to clogging of the arteries and heart disease. The study found that walking cut fat levels by 11 per cent, compared with not doing any exercise. But short bursts of sprints on a bike cut it by 33 per cent – the sort of effect expected from a 90-minute run.","Scientists suggest short bursts of daily exercise more effective than long infrequent sessions .

However, researchers found eating plenty of fruit and vegetables wards off the blues. A study of more than 2,000 men found a healthy diet reduced their risk of developing the mental illness which affects almost a fifth of British adults. Middle aged men whose diets are loaded with junk food - such as processed meat and sugary drinks - are at greater risk of suffering from depression . And shedding the pounds by improving diet and exercising more was associated with fewer cases of the condition. Nutritionist Anu Ruusunen, of the University of Eastern Finland, said: 'The study reinforces the hypothesis a healthy diet has potential not only in the warding off of depression, but also in its prevention.' Patients with depression often eat poorly and consume fewer nutrients, but it has been unclear whether diet is linked with the risk in healthy people. The new study found those who ate most vegetables, fruits, berries, whole grains, poultry, fish and low fat cheese suffered less symptoms and a lower risk of the condition during 13 years of follow up. Increased intake of folate found in vegetables, fruits, berries, whole grains, meat and liver also had a beneficial affect, along with greater coffee consumption. And participation in a three year lifestyle intervention programme involving a separate group of 140 middle aged men and women improved depression scores, with slimmer bodies leading to fewer symptoms. Eating plenty of fruit and vegetables wards off the blues . But a junk food diet characterised by eating a lot of sausages, processed meats, sugary drinks, desserts and snacks, manufactured foods and baked or processed potatoes was associated with an increase in cases. Contrary to some earlier observations, vitamin B12 intake, tea drinking and total caffeine intake were not related to the risk of depression in this study. The study was based on the population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study and the participants were all middle aged or older Finnish men. Their diet was measured by food records and food frequency questionnaires, and information on cases of depression was obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Register. Depression is one of the leading health challenges in the world and its effects on public health, economics and quality of life are enormous. Not only treatment of depression, but also prevention of depression needs new approaches. Diet and other lifestyle factors may be one possibility. The research was published in Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, European Journal of Nutrition, Public Health Nutrition and Diabetic Medicine. In the UK, depression hits 19 per cent of people with 21 per cent of women reporting symptoms and 16 per cent of men. The highest rates occur among those aged between 50 and 54.","Middle aged men who eat lots of junk food are at greater risk of depression .

"By . Emma Innes . A little girl with Down’s syndrome has learnt to swim, sing, and even dance, by copying her twin sister. Viola Fuller, six, from Gillingham, in Dorset, has Down’s syndrome, but her twin sister, Nigella, does not. The girls’ proud parents, Nigel and Agata, say Viola is thriving - and believe she is doing so well thanks to copying her sister. Viola Fuller (top), six, has Down's syndrome and she is thriving with the help of her twin sister, Nigella, who does not have the condition . Mrs Fuller, 35, said: ‘Children with Down’s syndrome are very visual and they learn by copying. ‘Because Viola could watch Nigella reach all these milestones, and then copy her, she has been able to reach them too. ‘We could spend hours with a therapist trying to teach Viola something, but then all she’d have to do is watch Nigella doing it and she could copy. ‘There is a special sign language that people with Down’s syndrome can use, called Makaton. Nigella picked it up easily and was able to teach it to Viola. ‘We always had faith in Viola, but Nigella has made a real difference to her. She added: ‘There are other factors too, and we have excellent medical professionals who work with Viola to ensure her progress, but they really do have that twin thing going on.’ Viola has learned to dance, swim and sing by watching Nigella but her parents say she does become frustrated if she can't keep up with her sister . The girls' parents, Nigel and Agata, believe Viola has had an advantage in reaching her milestones because she is able to copy Nigella . When Viola was born, her parents had no idea how able she would be. Mrs Fuller said: ‘The doctors are very careful not to say that your child definitely will be able to this, or definitely will be able to do that. ‘Some children with Down’s syndrome get on very well in life, while others will have hearing, visual, speech and various health problems. ‘It was a just a case of wait and see what happens. Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features. Most babies with Down's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone, eyes that slant upwards, a low birth weight, a small nose and mouth and short fingers. They also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children. Some children with Down's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders, digestive problems, hearing and visual impairments, thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders. It is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK. It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby's cells. Currently, no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but Down's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers. For example, if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having Down's syndrome, but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby, there is a one in 30 chance of it having Down's syndrome. Source: NHS Choices . ‘Luckily, Viola is high functioning, and with Nigella by her side - plus many experts, doctors and family members who have helped us along the way - she’s doing really well.’ The couple first noticed Nigella’s influence on her sister when they were learning to walk. Mr Fuller said: ‘When Nigella began to crawl, we didn’t expect Viola to be able to reach that goal so quickly. ‘But when Viola started crawling too and becoming more mobile, we realised how important Nigella was to her sister. ‘Now, Viola sees Nigella picking up a book to read and she’s started to do it too. ‘Nigella had swimming lessons and now Viola does them too. ‘They’re very close, which is lovely - they both love to sing and dance together - their favourite song is We Will Rock You. It’s a wonderful thing to see.’ Mr and Mrs Fuller were unaware that one of their daughters would have Down’s syndrome. It was only when the girls were just a few hours old that doctors diagnosed Viola’s Down’s syndrome. Mrs Fuller said: ‘I had a normal pregnancy and had no reason to expect anything other than two healthy babies. ‘Nigella was born first and then they gave me Viola. ‘I remember thinking that Viola had her eyes shut and that she looked a bit different, but as soon as she opened her eyes I thought she was fine. ‘I was a first time mother so I had no reason to suspect anything was wrong. ‘Then the doctors told me that rather than stay on the ward I could have my own room. ‘At the time I thought this was lovely but now I know it’s because they wanted somewhere private to tell us what was going on. ‘At about three hours old a doctor examined Viola and asked me if I had ever heard of Down’s syndrome. Mr and Mrs Fuller did not know Viola had Down's syndrome until she was about three hours old . ‘I said that I had and he told me he thought Viola had it. He started to point out signs like the extra line on her palm, her small (almond shaped) eyes and her low muscle tone and it suddenly became obvious. ‘The doctor kept speaking but I felt like someone had put a glass wall between us and I couldn’t really see or hear him. It was just so surreal, I felt like I was watching a film. ‘It was the biggest shock of my life, but as the doctor left us with some leaflets he told me to enjoy my baby - those words really stuck with me and they still do now. ‘Whenever I find myself getting frustrated I just think back to that moment and I remind myself how lucky I am to have my daughters.’ Mr Fuller said: 'When Nigella began to crawl, we didn't expect Viola to be able to reach that goal so quickly. But when Viola started crawling too and becoming more mobile, we realised how important Nigella was to her' Viola attends the same mainstream school as Nigella and the girls' parents say Nigella is always there to look out for her sister . Now, at age six, Viola is in mainstream school with her sister. Her mother said: ‘Sometimes Viola gets jealous that her sister can do things easier than she can, but they get on very well. ‘They are so close and if Viola ever runs into difficultly at school, Nigella will always be there to help her. ‘For a short time another child was picking on Viola, but Nigella stepped in and told the girl how lovely her sister was. ‘Nigella will always find things easier than her sister, but Viola is high functioning and she’s coming on leaps and bounds. Speaking of the girls' birth, Mrs Fuller said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life, but as the doctor left us with some leaflets he told me to enjoy my baby - those words really stuck with me and they still do now' Mrs Fuller said: 'Viola is cheeky, funny, outgoing and has a wonderful confidence that we adore - she rewards and touches everyone that comes into contact with her' ‘They are just like any other six-year-old girls - they love dancing and gymnastics, and swimming, and they’re big fans of Beyoncé. ‘They’re big fans of Disney and think they’re princesses themselves most of the time. ‘Nigella is a very special little girl, and we think she has grown up to be more tolerant, patient and caring than children of her own age. ‘Viola is cheeky, funny, outgoing and has a wonderful confidence that we adore - she rewards and touches everyone that comes into contact with her. ‘We are very proud of both of our girls.'

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Global sales for fast food giant McDonald's have slumped to a 10-year record low with Australia singled out as a 'weak' market. Internationally, Australia is part of the worst performing sector for this year's second quarter, the Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa operation, where sales fell by a massive 7.3 per cent. McDonald's chief executive Don Thompson defined under performing Australian and Japanese markets as weak and said the Illinois-based company was concentrating on 'stabilising' key priority markets in both Australia and Japan, as well as Germany and the U.S., reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Australia has been identified as a weak market for McDonald's and is part of the fast food chain's worst performing global sector . On the back of the slump, a McDonald's Australia spokesperson said the Australian business was strong and growing despite a 'challenging environment'. But as consumers look for healthier options in an increasingly competitive market, McDonald's recorded its worst global results in a decade with a 2.5 per cent drop in June and July. The results are its weakest since 2003 when the chain posted a 3.7 per cent fall over consecutive months. McDonald's has faced increase scrutiny in Australia in recent months thanks to the rollout of its controversial home delivery service already available in areas across Sydney's west including North Parramatta and Waterloo and Stanmore in the city's inner suburbs. McDonald's chief executive Don Thompson said the company was 'stabilising' the Australian market . The move is part of the fast food chain's strategy to 'stablise' the Australian market by increasing sales, but the service has been slammed by health groups concerned about easier access to junk food. Areas in Melbourne and Hervey Bay in Queensland's south east are trialling the service this month. The Hervey Bay trial has come under particular attack due to the area's already extremely overweight population where two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one quarter of children are also overweight or obese, reported the ABC. Queensland's Australian Medical Association president Dr Shaun Rudd said the service could compound the problem of obesity. 'It's pretty sad. These large corporations have a look where they're going to get the most bang for their buck and they choose places like that,' he said. 'I think unfortunately they'll sell more food and that means there's going to be more burgers and more fries eaten by the population there, and they are already extremely overweight.' Yet McDonald's has already hailed the service a success and confirmed its plans to continue expanding it throughout the country once trials are finished. McDonald's and other fast food chains have also faced further criticism after a Cancer Council study found they were advertising higher-calorie adults meals to children by using an advertising code loophole. The company slump has been intensified in the U.S. due to increases competition from other chains offering limited menus . The study found McDonald’s Chicken 'n' Cheese Burger and KFC's Mint Choc Krusher were some of the adult meals shown to children. Internationally the company sparked food safety concerns with reports workers at a Shanghai plant were repackaging expired meat. The fast food chain promptly stopped using supplies from the plant, which meant many Asian stores could not serve Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets. McDonalds was also ordered to pay $27 million in damages in July due to relaxed security in a Texas store leading to the death of two teenagers in 2012. Denton Ward, 18, was bashed to death in the store and his 18-year-old partner Lauren Crisp was killed when she crashed her car while trying to get him to hospital. Despite the slump in McDonald's global sales, Burger King Worldwide has recorded its third consecutive sales growth in Canada and the U.S. Yet with more than 35,600 restaurants internationally and with 19 per cent owned by McDonald's, the fast food giant plans to franchise 1,500 of its company-owned stores mainly outside the U.S. by 2016. In the U.S. there has also been move from consumers to chains offering limited menus over McDonald's all in one approach.

"By . Corey Charlton . Google has begun lobbying the state of California to allow it to test driverless motorbikes and trucks on its roads. The technology giant has caused controversy over its driverless vehicle testing in recent years as critics complain of its role in our ever-increasing reliance on technology. Despite the project still being in its infancy, documents reveal Google now wants to extend its permission to use driverless cars on public roads to other types of vehicles. Scroll down for video . Google engineer Anthony Levandowski with the 'Ghostrider' robot motorbike he developed . The Sunday Times . reported Ron Medford, the director of safety for Google's self-driving . car programme, requested permission in a letter to the California state . government on January 13. It said: 'It is certainly possible that future testing could include motorcycles or larger commerical vehicles. 'If . some innovator can demonstrate that testing autonomous technology on . such vehicles is safe, then they should be allowed to test.' In .

Capped at a speed of 40kph, they feature two seats with seat belts, buttons to start and stop and a screen showing the vehicle's route. Google boasts the vehicles 'never get tired or distracted' and said have clocked up about 1.2million kilometres of driving time on California roads.

"By . Associated Press . For the first time, U.S. public schools are projected this fall to have more minority students than non-Hispanic whites, a shift largely fueled by growth in the number of Hispanic children partially due to workers migrating from Mexico and other countries to work on mushroom farms. The changing demographics of American education are apparent inside Jane Cornell's summer school classroom, where giggling grade-schoolers mostly come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. The sign outside the classroom reads 'Welcome' and 'Bienvenidos' in polished handwriting. Non-Hispanic white students are still expected to be the largest racial group in the public schools this year at 49.8 percent. But according to the National Center for Education Statistics, minority students, when added together, will now make up the majority. Minorities will become majority: According to the National Center for Education Statistics, minority students, when added together, will now make up the majority . Higher birth rate: U.S. public schools are projected this fall to have more minority students enrolled than white, a shift largely fueled by growth in the numbers of Hispanic children . Added up: White students are still expected to be the largest racial group in the public schools this year at 49.8 percent but there are more minorities in schools in general when added together . About one-quarter of the minority students are Hispanic, 15 percent are black and 5 percent are Asian and Pacific Islanders. Biracial students and Native Americans make up an even smaller share of the minority student population. The shift brings new academic realities, such as the need for more English language instruction, and cultural ones, such as changing school lunch menus to reflect students' tastes. But it also brings up some complex societal questions that often fall to school systems to address, including issues of immigration, poverty, diversity and inequity. The result, at times, is racial tension. In Louisiana in July, Jefferson Parish public school administrators reached an agreement with the federal government to end an investigation into discrimination against English language learners. In May, police had to be called to help break up a fight between Hispanic and black students in at a school in Streamwood, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, after a racially-based lunchroom brawl got out of control. Learning in action: School District Superintendent Barry Tomasetti meeting with young students in teacher Jane Cornell's summer school class at Mary D. Lang Kindergarten Center in Pennsylvania . Issues of race and ethnicity in schools also can be more subtle. In Pennsylvania's Kennett Consolidated School District, Superintendent Barry Tomasetti described parents who opt to send their kids to private schools in Delaware after touring diverse classrooms. Other families, he said, seek out the district's diverse schools 'because they realize it's not a homogenous world out there.' The changes in the district from mostly middle-to-upper class white to about 40 percent Hispanic was in part driven by workers migrating from Mexico and other countries to work the mushroom farms. 'We like our diversity,' Tomasetti said, even as he acknowledged the cost. He has had to hire English language instructors and translators for parent-teacher conferences. He has cobbled money together to provide summer school for many young English language learners who need extra reading and math support. 'Our expectation is all of our kids succeed,' he said. The new majority-minority status of America's schools mirrors a change that is coming for the nation as a whole. The Census Bureau estimates that the country's population also will have more minorities than whites for the first time in 2043, a result of higher birth rates among Hispanics and a stagnating or declining birth rate among blacks, whites and Asians. Moving towards success: Recent high school graduate Christian Cordova-Pedroza as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press at Mary D. Lang Kindergarten Center . In class: Teacher Jane Cornell working with young students on their storytelling skills during summer school at Mary D. Lang Kindergarten Center . Even as the population becomes more diverse, schools are becoming more racially divided, reflecting U.S. housing patterns. The disparities are evident even in the youngest of black, Hispanic and Native American children, who on average enter kindergarten academically behind their white and Asian peers. They are more likely to attend failing schools and face harsher school discipline. Later, they have lower standardized test scores, on average, fewer opportunities to take advanced classes, and are less likely to graduate. As the school age population has become more nonwhite, it's also become poorer, said Patricia Gandara, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA who serves on President Barack Obama's advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. Roughly one-quarter of Hispanics and African-Americans live below the poverty line — meaning a family of four has nearly 24,000 in annual income —  and some of the poorest of Hispanic children are dealing with the instability of being in the country illegally or with a parent who is, Gandara said. Focusing on teacher preparation and stronger curriculum is 'not going to get us anywhere unless we pay attention to the really basic needs of these children, things like nutrition and health and safety, and the instability of the homes,' she said. This transformation in school goes beyond just educating the children. Educators said their parents also must feel comfortable and accepted in schools.

"By . Associated Press . One of the largest ranches in the U.S. and an icon for Texas horse and cattlemen has been listed for $725 million, marking the end of a decades-long courtroom battle among the heirs of cattle baron W.T. Waggoner, who established the estate in 1923. The estate includes the 510,000-acre ranch spread over six North Texas counties, with two main compounds, hundreds of homes, about 20 cowboy camps, hundreds of quarter-horses, thousands of heads of cattle, 1,200 oil wells and 30,000 acres of cultivated land, according to Dallas-based broker Bernie Uechtritz, who is handling the sale along with broker Sam Middleton of Lubbock. Iconic: The Waggoner Ranch is the largest contiguous ranch in the United States . Sprawling: The estate includes the 510,000-acre ranch spread over six North Texas counties, with two main compounds, hundreds of homes, and about 20 cowboy camps . On the market: The Waggoner Ranch is being listed for $725million . Heirs and stakeholders currently occupy two of the three principle houses and much of the estate has not yet been explored for oil and other mineral reserves. Uechtritz says the estate falls within a 'super asset class,' akin to selling the 'Statue of Liberty' of cowboy culture. The Waggoner Ranch is the largest contiguous ranch in the United States. W.T. Waggoner's father, Dan Waggoner, started ranching in 1849, and the Waggoner name was prominent in the development of Hereford cattle and pedigree American quarter horses. 'What really sets it apart is that all this land has been kept together under one fence by one family for nearly 100 years, and its history in the settling of the West,' said court-appointed receiver Mike Baskerville. W.T. Waggoner built the Arlington Downs racetrack that operated in Arlington during the 1930s. His granddaughter Electra Waggoner Biggs was a noted sculptress after whom Buick named a luxury car and Lockheed named a plane. Map: Weldon Hawley, ranch manager for the W.T. Waggoner Estate in Vernon, Texas indicates the area of the ranch where approximately 2,000 acres burned in 2011. Its listing marks the end of a decades-long courtroom battle among the heirs of cattle baron W.T. Waggoner, who established the estate in 1923 . Features: The Waggoner Ranch also includes hundreds of quarter-horses, thousands of heads of cattle, 1,200 oil wells and 30,000 acres of cultivated land . In 1991, she filed a lawsuit seeking the liquidation of the family estate, spurring a 12-year family feud. Biggs died in 2001. When a district judge ruled in favor of liquidation in 2003, one of the estate's primary stakeholders, A.B. 'Bucky' Wharton III, appealed. The family agreed to list the estate after the court said it was considering ordering an auction of the assets, Baskerville said. The listing has already attracted attention from interested buyers, he said. Local residents have been worried that oil wildcatters or foreign investors will divide up the land and fire ranch employees, more motivated by making a profit than preserving history.","The Waggoner Ranch is the largest contiguous ranch in the United States .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Two couples in California kidnapped, gagged and bound a 44-year-old woman inside a squalid garage, demanding that her husband pay up a six-figure ransom he couldn't possibly afford. Detectives in Rowland Heights, Los Angeles County, say that the woman was denied food and water for two days and was made to relieve herself in a bucket. 'The victim was located in very squalid conditions in a cluttered garage, on the floor,' said Captain Merrill Ladenheim, of the LA County Sheriff's Office, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune. 'She was duct taped. Her hands were bound.' A 44-year-old woman was kept inside this squalid garage for two days without food or water. Her kidnappers demanded a $110,000 ransom . The victim was gagged and bound amid piles of random objects, and was forced to relieve herself in a bucket . Investigators say the plot was hatched after one of the victim's co-workers, Judith Maldonado, overheard that the woman had saved up some money with her husband of 20 years. Then on Monday, when the victim missed her bus, Maldonado and boyfriend Francisco Inacua-Rosas offered her a ride home. The couple told the victim they had to stop by a restaurant to pick up some food. While on the way there, Inacua-Rosas text-messaged his sister and her boyfriend, Rocio Inacua and Uziel Figueroa, and told them to meet up at the restaurant. 'Both Rocio Inacuna and Uziel Figueroa then, at gunpoint, forced the victim down the floorboard, bound, gagged and blindfolded her, and drove her to that garage in Rowland Heights,' Nishida said. Inacua called the victim's husband and demanded $110,000, a sum far larger than the victim had. The husband called the police, who tracked down the kidnappers in two days. Judith Maldonado (left) was a long-time co-worker of the victim and overheard the woman say she was saving money with her husband. She and boyfriend Francisco Inacua-Rosas (right) lured the victim into kidnapping with a ride . LA County deputies rescued the 44-year-old victim two days after her kidnapping. Although starved and thirsty for two days, she is expected to recover . Rocio Inacua (left) and her boyfriend, Uziel Figueroa (right), are each being held on $2 million bail on suspicion of kidnapping. Together with the other two suspects, they face life in prison without the possibility of parole . 'Upon being rescued from those squalid conditions, she removed her blindfold, the duct tape, and immediately saw the lead detective, who happened to be in the door of the garage,' Ladenheim said. 'She immediately hugged the detective,' he added. 'It was a very, very emotional rescue, and we are happy to report that she is safe and expected to make a full recovery.' The four — Maldonado, 40, Inacua-Rosas, 34, Inacua, 32, and Figueroa, 32 — are being held on $2 million bail each. They face life in prison without the possibility of parole.","Woman in Rowland Heights, California, was taken captive after a co-worker overheard her talk about saving money with her husband of 20 years .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . From the humble sandwich to an expensive salad, there are few dishes that don't taste better with bacon. And now, the point has been even mathematically proven. A massive number-crunching exercise has revealed that dishes with bacon really do taste better - and very few taste worse. Better with bacon: New research has found that virtually every dish - especially sandwiches - taste better when a rasher or two is added . Tech magazine Wired teamed up with the Food Network to analyse 50,000 recipes and 906,539 comments on them. Previous research has pinpointed the exact chemical reaction that makes bacon so smell so tempting. Called the Maillard reaction, it occurs between an amino acid and a reducing sugar when heated. The acid and sugar react to release a huge amount of smells and flavour that make us salivate. Elin Roberts, of the Centre for Life education centre in Newcastle, explained the reaction releases hundreds of smells and flavours, but it is the smell which reels in the eater. 'If we couldn't smell, then taste wouldn't be the same.' Explaining how the results were calculated, Wired writer Cliff Kuang said: 'First, we searched out all the recipes that fit a certain description - sandwiches, for example. 'Then, we calculated the average rating for those foods if they did not include the word “bacon.” 'We ran the numbers again using only recipes that did include bacon. Of all the foods we analysed, bacon lends the most improvement to sandwiches.' Many other dishes also got a boost when bacon was added - when the data was analysed, those with with a rasher or two included got better scores. There are various theories as to why - not least because of the crunch and flavour bacon adds to sandwiches. It's also a good addition to salads - providing it doesn't go soggy. Recipes with spinach and asparagus were all rated better when they contained bacon, for example. But . it wasn't all good news. There are foods that get worse with bacon - . namely pasta (particularly in creamy sauces) and, rather unsurprisingly, . desserts. The data analysis also gave a fascinating snapshot into the most popular foods through the last few years. The data analysis also gave a fascinating snapshot into the most popular foods through the last few years, including the surge in popularity of cupcakes since 2009 . Two major trends are the surge in popularity of cupcakes and gluten-free products since 2009, while salted caramel and sriacha (hot sauce from Thailand) have soared in popularity since 2011. On the other hand, portobello mushrooms and low carb diets were big in 2007, but have nose dived since then. The trends were calculated by findings the total number of reviews for each food. Wired and the Food Network then calculated what percentage of the recipe reviews came in each quarter since 2007. But the results clearly show one thing: bacon has always been popular.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . Amateur ghost hunters claim they have made contact with the spirit of Richard III, next to the bed where the king reportedly spent his last night. Members of the paranormal investigation group Haunted Heritage said they recorded the spooky encounter at Donington le Heath Manor House, Leicestershire, last year. But they said they did not want to publicise the recording at the time because of the furore surrounding the discovery of the king's remains under a Leicester car park. Scroll down for video . The ghost hunters said that they came into contact with a man they believe to be Richard III in the room, where he stayed before the Battle of Bosworth . The Haunted Heritage investigators pictured next to the bed where they heard the spooky voice . It is believed that King Richard III spent the night at the house before riding out to the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 and dying on the battlefield. King Richard III was defeated by Henry Tudor and the battle is regarded as one of the most defining moments in British history. During a recording, the group ask: 'What is your name' a reply of 'Richard' can then be heard. The group then say: 'Thank you so much for that.' Medium Gill Hibbert, 56, from Coalville, Leicestershire said: 'It was in the main room upstairs in the manor house - it was coming up to the witching hour. 'We had been there since 8pm. At about 11.45pm, we started the call-out session. 'We were standing in the dark, but there was a bit of light coming in through the window.' Mrs Hibbert said she asked if anyone was there and then said: 'come forward'. Richard III's remains were discovered by archaeologists in 2012. His body was buried in what was Grey Friars Church, Leicester, after his death. The site later became a council car park . She then switched on the ghost box - a modified radio which allows spirits to 'speak' through white noise - and called out again. She said: 'Then we heard the name, 'Richard' - it was so clear. We were blown away. 'The night was quite uneventful up until then - we had a few knocks and bangs - but when that came through it was the icing on the cake.' Mrs Hibbert said the voice was one of the best examples of paranormal contact the group had witnessed. They have given the recording an 'A' grade because of the clarify of the sound. The group has now contacted professional paranormal investigators so that the recording can be analysed further. Donington le Heath Manor House is said to be the place where Richard III spent his final night . Mrs Hibbert said: 'We're not saying it's Richard III. 'We're trying to get a historian from Donington le Heath to look into other Richards who have lived there. 'But no one has found anything yet. We are being careful about saying it's Richard III because we can't prove it.' Richard's remains were discovered by archaeologists in 2012.

Passengers expecting to take off at midnight on the Boeing 747 flight QF108, were initially told that their plane had been delayed for only 14 hours. The delay was due to a technical problem with the cooling system on-board the aircraft, while the cabin crew's working hour restrictions delayed the flight further. Qantas flight QF108 from Los Angeles to Sydney was delayed for 23 hours, with passengers waiting 14 hours overnight at the airport before being offered hotel rooms . A spokesperson for Qantas apologised for the 'unfortunate sequence of events', saying: 'There was an issue with the onboard cooling system, which has taken some time for our engineers to repair. 'We organised a replacement aircraft, however because of the initial delay cabin crew would have exceeded their maximum hours allowed to work which meant a further delay.' Exhausted travellers were initially told they would not be offered hotel rooms due to the lack of availability, however food and drinks were offered by the airline which eventually began transferring customers to hotel rooms after a 14 hour wait. After requests from furious passengers, Qantas eventually offered some of their stranded customers access to their member's lounge. Furious passengers such as Tim Bednall, took to social media to vent their frustration at the airline . The flight was delayed due to technical problems with the onboard cooling system and restrictions on cabin crew working overtime . Many passengers and the family members of those stranded took to social media to vent their frustration and concern for the extremely long delay. Most vocal was Victorian man Tim Bednall, who initially tweeted: 'Stuck at LAX for over 4 hours waiting for my flight, and still no ETA as to when the plane will be fixed. Thanks #qantas!' '#qantas claims it can't put us up in a hotel (none available), and no places open in the terminal to buy food.' 'At least #qantas brought around some doggy bags with food in it.'

The two-year-old boy, who was born to the siblings in Northern Ireland in 2012, will be put up for adoption after Mr Justice O'Hara agreed to a freeing order. Sitting in the High Court in Belfast, the judge ruled that the mother - who is now 16 - was incapable of giving consent for adoption herself. Scroll down for video . The two-year-old boy, who was born to the siblings aged 15 and 13 in Northern Ireland in 2012, will be put up for adoption after Mr Justice O'Hara agreed to a freeing order during a hearing at the High Court in Belfast (above) The girl's brother, who initially disputed that he was the father but was found to be so after a DNA test confirmed his paternity, was barely involved in the proceedings. Mr Justice O'Hara's verdict came after he described the case as 'depressing' and 'hugely unsatisfactory'. The hearing heard how both the mother and son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were taken into care after the birth but were sent to different foster homes. The mother was already known to social services due to previous concerns about her own mother, step-father and siblings. The judge said the mother, now 16, was incapable of giving consent for adoption herself (file picture) 'None of this is her fault – she is a victim of the way in which she was raised,' the judge said. 'It is hard to identify any positive life experience which she has enjoyed.' A report from a psychiatrist revealed 'in grim detail how miserable her life has been'. It stated: 'She is not in a position to fully understand the possible consequences of the various decisions which have to be made for herself and for the boy.' The freeing order came after local authorities sought to have the boy adopted for his best interests. In a judgement made public last week, Mr Justice O'Hara said: 'She is undoubtedly capable of making some decisions as is shown by some elements of the psychological assessment but not a decision which is of a magnitude and which has the consequences of the present one. 'It appears to me that this finding on her competence undermines the proposition that she can be properly regarded as unreasonably withholding her agreement to adoption. 'I am satisfied that the agreement of the mother to the making of an adoption order for the child should be dispensed with because she is incapable of giving her agreement.'

Apology: Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity was forced to apologise after a telephone firm acting on its behalf made nuisance calls hounding vulnerable and elderly people for donations . The charity said yesterday it had stopped using the call firm and would conduct a thorough investigation of its methods. The apology came after an investigation of telephone charity fundraisers by Channel 4’s Dispatches programme. It put undercover researchers into two firms, NTT Fundraising in Bristol and Pell and Bales in London, which are contracted by charities including the GOSHCC, the Royal National Institute of Blind People, Oxfam, Unicef and Barnardo’s. A researcher working at NTT on a campaign for the hospital was told by a woman who said she had a terminally ill daughter that she did not want to ‘talk about it’. The researcher listed her as a ‘hard refusal’ who should not be called again, but a manager said: ‘We don’t want to do it as a hard refusal because she hasn’t said she doesn’t want calls . . . if you get my point? ‘She hasn’t said “don’t call me” –  she has just said she doesn’t want to talk about it; soft refusal. As much as it feels bad and unethical, it is a soft refusal.’ The woman’s name was listed to be called again. 'Shocked': GOSHCC said it was 'shocked and deeply distressed to hear of the evidence of unacceptable behaviour', and would be investigating the methods used by telephone fundraisers . Dispatches said scripts given to call centre staff ask them to make three requests for money to everyone they speak to. At NTT, this applied even when a woman said she was too depressed to talk. A manager told an undercover researcher that ‘being depressed is not really a get-out-of-jail card’. GOSHCC said: ‘We were shocked and deeply distressed to hear of the evidence of unacceptable behaviour and ways of working presented in this report and we would like to apologise to anyone affected.’ At Pell and Bales, a researcher was given a script in a campaign for RNIB that she believed asked her to claim she was calling directly from the charity. She was told ‘we are in that way like the voice of the RNIB’, although the script contained a statement that the call was being made by Pell and Bales and the firm was being paid. The RNIB said: ‘Our fundraising activity fully meets the very high standards we set ourselves.’ Professor Stephen Lee, a former director of the Institute of Fundraising, which promotes the industry code of practice followed by the firms involved, said a review was needed, ‘not only of the agencies but also of the way in which fundraisers are managing these relationships’. NTT Fundraising told the Dispatches programme, to be broadcast tonight: ‘We train and monitor our staff rigorously. Complaints about our calls are extremely rare: the 1.25million calls we made last year generated fewer than 100 complaints. However . . . we are constantly striving to improve.’ Pell and Bales said: ‘Scripts are written in association with our partner charities in line with  legal requirements and best practice guidelines.’","NTT Fundraising made calls on behalf of Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Plot: Joanne Berry, 30, , pictured today at Maidstone Crown Court, posed as a woman with a sex fantasy and sent a man to her colleagues house with instructions to 'burst in' and rape her . A woman who used a sex chatroom to send a stranger to rape a colleague in her home has been jailed for six years. Joanne Berry, 30, posed on sex sites as a woman with a rape fantasy - but gave the men she spoke to the address and details of her colleague instead, a court heard. She told a man, Dean Hicks, to knock on the front door of the woman, who cannot be named, then burst in and rape her. Mr Hicks went to the address thinking the woman would share his fantasy, but realised there had been a mistake and told her to call the police. The jury at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent heard that the woman had been giving Berry emotional support, and was being texted by her as much as 12 times a day. But her demands became too much, and the woman told Berry to stop. Days later Mr Hicks appeared at her door. Berry was found guilty of  four offences, including common assault and attempting to force penetrative sex upon the victim, at a hearing in May. Jailing her today, Judge David Griffith-Jones QC said: ''You underwent these offences in a wicked and calculated albeit frankly bizarre fashion. Your victim happened to be a work colleague. 'She had been kind to you when you confided in her about some personal matters and some hardships. 'Dr Hussain, a consultant psychiatrist, decided you were fragile and psychologically vulnerable with a low self-esteem, but that you had no mental illness and no psychiatric history. 'It is to be noted that the word 'bizarre' features regularly in my sentencing. It is highly unlikely that the counsel had anything like this in mind when they wrote the guidelines. 'By the seriousness of these offences taking account the totality of the criminality, I impose the shortest sentence I feel I possibly can. That sentence is a sentence of six years imprisonment.' The judge said Berry was in denial throughout proceedings, and that it was only by chance that the victim had not actually been raped. Prosecutor Andrew Espley said: 'Joanne Berry arranged for men to go round to [the victim's] house and rape her. 'How did she do it? She went on various sex chat websites. She pretended she was [the victim], she gave [the victim's] address, she used her name, she gave the registration of her car which was going to be parked outside, pretended to be her. 'She then told the men to come round and engage in a fantasy rape game with her, basically to rape her.' The court heard how Berry confided in the victim with her personal problems. In April 2012, when Berry texted her, implying she was about to kill herself, the victim decided to alert the police and give them Berry's phone number. However, Berry refused to give the police her correct details, causing the victim to believe she was 'attention-seeking'. Jailed: Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, heard how Berry had confided in her victim over her personal problems - and had been told to back off just days before she sent Dean Hicks to her victim's house . She asked Berry not to contact her any more, and begged her to seek professional help because 'she was making her angry and frightened'. Mr Espley said the victim later received a series of texts from Berry saying that 'she had thought she could trust her and now she had lost her job and lost her as a friend'. A few days later Berry sent Dean Hicks to the victim's address in Kent. When Mr Hicks realised there was a mix-up and the victim had not been expecting him, he told her to call the police and he spoke to officers about what had happened, including the online messages he had received. Berry, an office temp worker, was arrested at her home in Lewisham, south London on May 27, 2012. Police found a large number of chat line posts with numerous men on her laptop which contained 'unpleasant sexual content' and referred to the victim's address. On May 14 Berry was convicted with putting the victim in fear of violence, committing an offence of assault with the intent of committing a relevant sexual offence, the common assault of the victim and attempting to cause the victim to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. She will serve up to half and will then be released on license. She was also told to sign the sex offenders' resigster, and will be banned from working with children for life.","Joanne Berry, 30, posed on sex sites as a woman with a rape fantasy .

"By . Corey Charlton . It is a charity shrouded in as much mystery as that of the organisation it supports. A charitable trust set up to support Britain's spies and spooks has been registered, but the listing, unsurprisingly, is rather short on details. The Cinquefoil Trust supports serving and former members of the domestic spy agency MI5 - specifically helping members and their families who have come across 'financial hardship'. The Cinquefoil Trust's only available contact detail is the post box it shares with its domestic spy agency MI5 . Pictured is the charity listing set up for Britain's spy agency, with most of its details kept under wraps . The charity's cloak and dagger listing lacks almost all details other registered charities provide, such as financial records and trustee names - for which it has received special dispensation by the Charity Commission to keep secret. Registered in June, The Cinquefoil Trust - named after the leaf that appears on the MI5 logo - cites a trust deed dated May 30 that is not listed. Its existence has long been known of, but only lately has it been registered with the Charity Commission. It does state, however, it is used for the relief of 'financial hardship amongst serving and former members of the security service, the dependants of any such member and those in a family relationship with any such member'. The Sunday Times reported fundraisers such as book sales, raffles and snooker tournaments were being held to pay for wheelchairs and house alterations for members injured in the line of duty. While book sales are a far cry from the often glamorous exploits associated with MI5, a source told the Times the trust had made a 'real difference' to many members' lives. Spy central: The MI5 headquarters near Vauxhall Cross on the River Thames . 'The trust has been able to make a real difference to people when they most need help and support. 'It is a great example of the close-knit community.' With no registered address or contact number, The Cinquefoil Trust's can only be reached via the MI5 post box, for which correspondence can be addressed to 'The Secretary'.","Britain's spy agency has publicly listed its secretive members' charity .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Jack Rodwell believes he can step straight in to England’s midfield in the wake of Steven Gerrard’s retirement – but is confident he could also do a job at centre-back for his country. Rodwell watched England’s horror show in Brazil with a sense of frustration having found himself out of the Three Lions picture following two seasons on the fringes at Manchester City. He signed for Sunderland this week in a £10million deal – where he has been guaranteed a start in the middle of the park – and the 23-year-old wants a place in Roy Hodgson’s squad for this month’s friendly with Norway. Moving backwards: Sunderland's Jack Rodwell believes he can do a job for England at centre-half . Mover: The former Manchester City man joined the Black Cats for £10million last week . ‘For me, it was difficult to watch (the World Cup) because I wanted to be there so much,’ said the three-times capped former Everton man. ‘Now I want to be back in it - that’s why I signed here.’ And Rodwell is confident of winning that call, regardless of the position. ‘I’d back myself to get back in at centre-midfield and I believe I could at centre-back,’ he added. It is in midfield, however, where he would prefer to influence matches. ‘I’m here (at Sunderland) as a central midfielder,’ he said. ‘I haven’t played centre-back since I was 16 really. But you never know, maybe one day I might step back when I’ve got no legs. ‘I’m wasted if I play there though. I think I’ve got more to offer than playing centre-back – it’s boring as well.’ In the wake of England’s worst-ever showing at a World Cup finals, it was suggested that players could benefit from escaping the Premier League and broadening their horizons overseas. That, however, is not for Rodwell, despite several offers. ‘I need to be seen here playing regularly if I want to get back into the England team, but maybe in the future (I’d go abroad),’ he said. ‘Never say never, but at the moment the Premier League is where it’s happening. That’s where you will be written about.’ Rodwell has followed the path of new team-mate Adam Johnson in fleeing City in search of regular football. And he hopes Hodgson will pay more visits to the Stadium of Light than the sole one he managed last season. ‘I’d like Roy Hodgson to see as many games as he could, obviously, and I think Adam Johnson was a little bit unlucky not to have got into the squad for the World Cup,’ he went on. ‘He had a very good end to the season, so hopefully the manager will get up here as much as possible.’","Rodwell joined Sunderland from Manchester City for £10million last week .

"By . Becky Evans . The boy has been banned from using threatening words or climbing on the roof of public buildings (file picture) An 11-year-old boy - dubbed 'Dennis the Menace' - has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be given a criminal Asbo after making his neighbours' lives a 'living hell'. The boy, who cannot be named, received the Criminal Anti-Social Behaviour Order, after a court heard he abused and spat at members of the public. He also kicked taxis and taunted a group of children with learning difficulties. Kidderminster Youth Court was told the child's actions caused havoc and he attacked other children and even threatened to shoot one with a pellet gun. The boy climbed onto the roofs of buildings, rode his bike the wrong way on roads and hurled stones at vehicles across Kidderminster, Worcestershire. A list of 50 separate crimes involving the boy over a two year period was relayed to the judge on last week. The order was granted following an application by West Mercia Police. It stops him using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or disorderly behaviour in a public place. He is also banned from climbing on the roof of any building or associate with another named boy in any public place apart from educational purposes and ordered to attend anger management sessions. Inspector Paul Crowley, from West Mercia Police, said after the case: 'This boy's appalling behaviour has been a cause of misery for people living in the Horsefair area and those using facilities such as St George's Park. 'He has also regularly caused problems in Kidderminster town centre and has been responsible for many complaints to the police. 'Obtaining a Criminal Anti-Social Behaviour Order is not a step we have taken lightly but he has ignored all our previous efforts to address his behaviour and this is necessary to protect people from his offending. 'We intend to rigorously enforce the order and hopefully the boy now realises how serious this is and that he cannot go on like this. The boy hurled stones at vehicles in Kidderminster and police said he caused regular problems in the town centre, pictured . 'If he breaches the order he could be sent to detention for up to five years. 'Residents previously affected by this boy will be notified about the Crasbo but we are also asking anyone who knows him and sees him breaking the terms of the order to call police in Kidderminster immediately.' The boy was given a 12-month intensive referral order incorporating anger management and victim awareness sessions along with a number of other conditions including a three-month curfew. He will also be put on a placement to help people with learning difficulties as part of the order. A six-month parenting order was also made against the boy's mother. One of his neighbours said today: 'He is a little menace. People round her have even dubbed him the original Dennis the Menace. 'He might only be a young lad but he's made it his business to make everyone's lives a living hell. 'Hopefully this will put him back on the right tracks.' Crasbo's differ from the more commonly known anti-social behaviour order because it comes on the back of a criminal conviction. The current age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten.","Kidderminster Youth Court told boy attacked and spat at locals .

The luck of the Irish: Dubliners are considered one of the most friendliest in the world . The top spots included Auckland, New Zealand; Melbourne, Australia; Victoria, Canada; and Charleston in South Carolina, US. Only two European cities made it into the top 10 - the other being Seville in Spain - compiled from the findings of the magazine's readers choice survey. Dublin is described as a 'vibrant city' and, in a nod to its literary fame, as a 'bibliophile's dream'.

The magazine also references US first lady Michelle Obama's trip to Dublin with her daughters last year when she was photographed with Bono at his local pub. Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland, said the city's high ranking came as no surprise. 'Again and again, our research shows us that the friendliness of our people is one of our unique selling points,' he said.

Munich-born Leopold Leisser will be called to support the prosecution case that millionaire Mr   Dewani is secretly gay and wanted to get out of his marriage to Anni. Leisser, who is based in Birmingham,  reportedly told police that he met Dewani for sex sessions after the relationship with his bride-to-be had begun. Scroll down for video . The family of Shrien Dewani family and their legal representatives arrive at the Western Cape High Court in Cape Town .

Dewani was brought up into the dock in front of his parents and other relatives. Pictured here is his father, Prakash Dewani (centre) British businessman Shrien Dewani leaves the Western Cape High Court in police custody . The 40-year-old, who describes himself as 'Europe's leading S&M (sadomasochism) Escort', claimed Dewani told him that he was engaged. Today, Dewani appeared in a South African . court where a judge ordered that he will remain at Valkenberg . Hospital in Cape Town to receive further treatment for his mental . health. Dressed in a dark suit and tie, he was brought up into the dock in front of his parents and other relatives. Dewani's . lawyer, Francois van Zyl said: 'I am informed that he has been fully . co-operative and that his condition has improved. We have been told by . treating psychiatrists not to consult with him for longer than 30 . minutes at a time.' Judge President John Hlophe postponed the matter until June 20. Dewani will remain in custody until then, at a secure mental facility. Dewani fought a long legal battle against extradition to South Africa to face a conspiracy to murder charge. He lost and was extradited last month, flying to South Africa by private jet for his first court appearance in  the country. Revelation: Dewani is pictured with his wife, Anni. South African police say he ordered the killing as he was gay and wanted out of the marriage . Claims: Prosecutors claim Dewani hired a hitman to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied . Dewani, a care home owner, has always denied ordering the killing of Anni. He has always denied being gay and says he can prove he was elsewhere on the dates Leisser said they met. Anni's father Vinod Hindocha, 64, has previously spoken of misgivings about the relationship even before the couple had their lavish £200,000 wedding in a Mumbai hotel. Anni's father told police that she wanted to end the engagement and walked out on her husband-to-be. A South African man pulls cardboard for recycling past a news broadcasting van outside the Western Cape High Court, Cape Town . Western Cape High Court, Cape Town, South Africa, where businessman Shrien Dewani appeared today . Mr Hindocha said that Anni became convinced that Dewani would change and told her father: 'Papa, he's like a Hitler - but don't worry - I will get married.' It also emerged that over a period of four months before the murder, 28-year-old Anni sent a sequence of messages to her cousin Sneha in Britain and they show the young bride had deep-seated reservations about Dewani. In one despairing message five weeks before the wedding, Anni told Sneha: 'I don't want to marry him... I'm going to be unhappy for the rest of my life... one cannot even hug him... we have nothing  in common.' Shrien Dewani, from Bristol, had fought his removal from the UK to face proceedings over wife Anni's death . In another text, Anni wrote: 'Want to cry myself to death.' Yet another read: 'Crying every day.' A month before the wedding she texted: 'Hate him.' And three days before her death, she messaged Sneha: 'I don't feel happy at all.' Sneha has told police that Anni called off the engagement and marriage at least three times, only for Shrien to change her mind each time. When the texts are taken alongside statements from other witnesses, the police files depict a marriage that was doomed before it began. Xolile Mngeni, who prosecutors claim was the hitman, was convicted of premeditated murder over the shooting, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence.","Leopold Leisser, 40, will be called to support the prosecution case .

"By . Angela Wintle . The accident is still so vivid in my memory. It was a hot August bank holiday afternoon in 1994 and I was driving home from my niece's christening in South Wales. I was tired – I'd just started a new job as head chef at Gidleigh Park Hotel in Devon and I'd been working long hours, keen to impress. My brother and his girlfriend had hitched a ride and were asleep on the back seat. The last thing I remember is cruising along the outside lane of the M4 in Gwent. Then I nodded off and the car drifted to the inside lane, hit the barrier and careered back across the motorway, colliding with the central reservation. Micahel lost his arm after falling asleep at the wheel back in 1994 . The driver's side took the full impact before the car screeched along the central reservation, flipped onto its roof and span round several times. I'll never forget the sound of screeching metal. It was awful. I woke on impact and began screaming, which woke up my brother and his girlfriend, who amazingly escaped with only superficial injuries. I wasn't so lucky. As I hung upside down, held in place by my seatbelt, I noticed a hand on the floor. Then I checked my right arm and realised there was nothing from the elbow down. I must have gripped the steering wheel so tightly that my arm was ripped off when the car was thrown into the air. I was losing a lot of blood but I just wanted to let go and die. My life was ruined. How could I continue cooking? I couldn't accept what had happened, so I wriggled out of the driver's side and began running – only to be met by other motorists who'd stopped to help urging me to lie down. Michael says that losing his arm taught him to live life to the very fullest . Luckily, one of them was a former military doctor, who stemmed the bleeding and urged me to stay awake to avoid slipping into a fatal coma. I wish I knew his name because he saved my life. Then a lady called Geraldine covered me with a blanket and urged me to think positive thoughts. She made me realise there was more to life than work – such as family and friends. And at that point I decided that, at 25, I was too young to die. Two weeks later I was back at work. Returning to the kitchen was tough, but I learned to delegate. If I couldn't chop a carrot, I'd ask someone else to do it. Paul Henderson, my then boss, was also hugely supportive, helping me source a state-of-the-art prosthetic arm in America. Slowly I gained the confidence and skill to become the chef I wanted to be. Nearly dying in that accident taught me to live life to the full. So I set myself goals – first to retain the hotel's existing Michelin star, then to secure another, which I did in 1999. Now I'm aiming for a third. Since then there have been many milestones, such as gaining an MBE in 2006 and Gidleigh Park being voted No 1 in The Sunday Times Food List last year. The accident made me a better man. I know what it's like to be reliant on those around you, and I believe in giving others the opportunities I was given. But I've never wanted pity: there's no room for that in my industry because to be the best you have to be good. You can't expect people to pay less because you only have one arm.

"By . Stephanie Linning . Failed: Staff first detected Patricia McQuade's cancer when she was admitted to hospital in September 2013 after breaking her arm in a fall . A hospital has apologised after doctors failed to treat a great-grandmother's cancer - even though they detected a tumour eight months before she died. Patricia McQuade, 66, died from pneumonia 12 hours after being admitted to the Royal Sunderland Hospital in May. But her family were only told that she had cancer, which hospital staff detected in September 2013, hours before she died - despite asking for details on her deteriorating condition. Medical staff revealed that the tumour had been picked up in a chest X-ray taken when the grandmother broke her arm eight months earlier and that no one had acted on the discovery. Mrs McQuade's son Danny, 45, and partner Joanne Knebel, have spent months trying to find out why no one acted on the tumour when it was detected. Sales assistant Miss Knebel, 39, said: 'She just deteriorated from an independent woman into someone who could do very little. 'The doctors apologised but I wonder what it would’ve been like for them if they had to watch someone they loved wish she was dead for the last five weeks of her life. 'She’d lost all of her dignity. She was so thin you could see the bones sticking out of her.' Mr McQuade added: 'We never got the chance to tell her she had cancer before she died.' Mrs McQuade, a grandmother of six and great-grandmother of five, was admitted to the Sunderland Royal Hospital in September 2013 after breaking her arm in a fall. The 4.4cm tumour was picked up by a chest X-ray, which was carried out because doctors thought she might have had a chest infection. But the information was never shared with Mrs McQuade, her family or any other hospital departments and after treatment for her broken arm, she was discharged. In the following eight months she became increasingly frail was eventually admitted back to the hospital with pneumonia. Apology: Bosses at Sunderland Royal Hospital apologised for failing to act after a chest X-ray detected Mrs McQuade's cancer and said they had investigated the situation surrounding the failure . Following her death Mr McQuade and Miss . Knebel met with NHS trust bosses who gave gave them the details of a . full investigation into what had happened. They apologised to her family, who say they are considering legal action, and pledged that lessons must be learned. Mr McQuade, who works as a customer manager, said: 'She could have had a couple of extra months with us at least if this was picked up. Questions: Mrs McQuade's son, Danny and his partner Joanne Knebel, pictured, have spent months trying to find out why no one acted on the tumour . 'For the last part of her life, we could have had help and support from people like Macmillan nurses if we’d known she had cancer, but we didn’t and the pain and sorrow we feel is terrible. 'Another thing we wonder is how many people this has happened too.' A report by Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, stated: 'It is certainly possible that the tumour had already spread at the time of the first X-ray.' She added: 'It may be likely that some form of palliative therapy would have been offered. 'It is likely that ultimately the cause of Mrs McQuade’s death would have remained the same even had the tumour been identified sooner with bronchopneumonia representing the terminal event.' A spokeswoman for City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to extend our sympathies once again to Mrs McQuade’s family on their sad loss. 'We have investigated the circumstances surrounding the failure to review Mrs McQuade’s X-ray and have met with her family to discuss the findings and to apologise for this error. 'Clearly in any investigation like this there are always lessons to be learned and we have, and will continue to, review our processes to minimise the risk of a similar incident happening in the future.'","Patricia McQuade's tumour was detected by chest X-ray in September 2013 .

"By . Rebecca Hardy . Three weeks ago Peter Bowles went with his wife Susan to visit the battle sites of World War I. ‘Not because of the centenary, but because I’m getting old and because I’ve always been aware of the tremendous loss of life and personal sacrifice.’ Peter was so disturbed by the sheer horror of it all they cut short the trip. ‘We went to Passchendaele where there are 42,000 gravestones and at least a third of them say: 'Known only to God.' ‘We’d gone with a terrific lecturer who was a professor of history and an ex-Gurkha. Scroll down for video . Peter Bowles at his home in Barnes, London, is preparing to star in a new play at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival . He said: 'See these fields? In three days 85,000 men died capturing that hill. A quarter of a million were wounded. They’ve only found 42,000 under the ground we’re walking on because the mud was so deep, so there are thousands and thousands of skeletons here still.' ‘A few days later the Germans came back and took the hill again. So there was such an incredible loss of life for what? It was so disturbing.’ This is a very different, reflective Peter to the actor who’s brought so much laughter into our lives through TV comedy classics To The Manor Born, Perfect Scoundrels and The Bounder. But Peter has extraordinary depth. Next week he takes up a guest role at the Edinburgh Fringe in Malcolm McKay’s Forgotten Voices, based upon the book Forgotten Voices Of The Great War by Max Arthur. Taken from the Imperial War Museum’s recorded testimonies of the veterans of World War I, it is a series of vividly moving accounts of battle and its terrible aftermath. The play has already opened to rave reviews with Julian Sands and Robert Vaughan in the guest role. Peter will be followed by the likes of Christopher Timothy and Robert Powell. ‘It’s such a privilege to be able to express some of the things that happen to men in war,’ he says. His . home in Barnes, South-West London is lined with books — an early . obsession. By the age of seven he had devoured the novels of Dickens, . and reading aloud to his primary school class led him into acting. After . leaving grammar school at 16, Peter won a scholarship to RADA, where . his contemporaries included Richard Briers, Alan Bates, Peter O’Toole, . Roy Kinnear and Albert Finney. Only Finney remains. O’Toole . died shortly before Christmas aged 81. Last year, Peter was mourning . his ‘dear friend’ director Patrick Garland, and before that the . much-loved The Good Life star Richard Briers. Video courtesy of Imperial War Museums . Peter Bowles appeared in comedy Only When I Laugh (pictured with Christopher Strauli and James Bolam) Peter Bowles recently went with his wife Susan to visit the battle sites of World War I but cut the trip short . He is pictured with on-screen wife Penelope Keith in To The Manor Born (left) and right with her at Keith Waterhouse's memorial service and his contemporary Peter O'Toole, who died before Christmas aged 81 . ‘Dear Ann [Briers’s wife] is fine,’ Peter tells me. ‘I was talking to her last week.’ And Patrick’s wife Alexandra? ‘She died a year after him. She had breast cancer.’ He is a kind, loyal friend and each death touches Peter, now 77, deeply, as well as making him aware of mortality. ‘There’s a bell up there,’ he points to the ceiling. ‘When I was at O’Toole’s memorial I was aware of that.’ Peter was just 13 when his best friend was knocked off his bike near his Nottingham home. ‘I went with a friend to see him in his coffin,’ says Peter. ‘In those days, working-class people used to lay the person out in the best room. There was my best friend — his name was Bosworth — lying in his coffin, his face probably made up a bit. ‘Walking back from there, these two 13-year-old boys talked to each other in a way they’d never talked before in their lives because they’d seen death. ‘It made me aware of love. That early, you don’t realise you have loved. If it’s a wife or a girlfriend, you know. But when you’re 13 and it’s a friendship, you don’t know until someone is taken from you.’ Peter and Susan, to whom he’s been blissfully married for 54 years, moved to their current home ten years ago. There are council flats on the street opposite their current home and it isn’t very flash. But, inside there’s a huge vaulted hallway and floor-to-ceiling glass looking out on to an oasis of a garden. He likes the flats opposite — they’re part of his roots. ‘I have a peculiar dichotomy in my background in that my parents [his father was a chauffeur/butler and his mother a nanny] worked for posh families but came from absolute basic stock,’ he says. He is known for several TV comedy classics including To The Manor Born, Perfect Scoundrels and The Bounder . Next week he takes up a guest role at the Edinburgh Fringe in Malcolm McKay's Forgotten Voices, based upon the book Forgotten Voices Of The Great War by Max Arthur . One such posting was at the massive Hinchingbrooke House in Cambridgeshire, where his father worked for the Earl of Sandwich. ‘My father taught the Aga Khan, who was a friend of the family, how to ride a bicycle.’ When the war came, Peter’s father went to work in a Rolls-Royce engine factory in Nottingham. The family moved to a ‘sort of Coronation Street two-up, two-down, no bathroom and an outside lavatory where all the ladies left the doors open to talk to each other sitting on the loo. ‘Inside the house my parents practised the sort of manners where if a lady came into the room, you’d stand up. Outside in the street it was the rough and tumble of real working class. I still go back sometimes and wander up and down the streets.’ At RADA, his Nottinghamshire accent was knocked out of him.  ‘When I came out, I didn’t know who I was,’ he says. ‘That, if anything, hampered my acting. ‘My parents saved up for a Burton suit when I was 17. I wore it for interviews. Most actors dressed as if they worked in a factory, in donkey jackets and caps. ‘And there was me, a working-class person, with this learnt accent and a suit. ‘The director Lindsay Anderson said: “Oh, Peter Bowles can’t act because I saw him in a suit.” Funnily enough, not long ago, I went up for a part of a Major-General in the Indian Mutiny. I’d put on a suit and stood in front of these Americans who laughed. They said: ""We’ve never seen an actor in a suit before."" ‘So I dropped my trousers and said: “I’ll read for you like this if it makes you happier"".' The young Peter would never have had such chutzpah. In fact, it wasn’t until he was 50 that he finally ‘knew who he was’. He was appearing in The Entertainer when its playwright, John Osborne, threw down the gauntlet one matinee. ‘He said: “I want to see acting that I haven’t seen in the British theatre for 25 years.” He came to the dressing room later, threw his arms around me and said: ""You’ve done it!"" ‘I realised the most important thing for an actor is not talent, it’s confidence. At 13, you are going to live for ever. ‘That’s why those boys going to war at 17 or 18 went over the top: they didn’t understand their own mortality. When you get older, you do, and you think: ""If only I’d known how wonderful youth is. If only I’d had the confidence"".'","Actor recalls death of friend who was knocked off his bike in Nottingham .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . One of the peculiar laws of quantum physics is that a particle can be in two different physical states at the same time - like how the Cheshire Cat could separate itself from its smile. If, for example, a beam of neutrons is divided into two beams using a silicon crystal, it can be shown that the individual neutrons can travel simultaneously along both paths in what is known as a ‘quantum superposition’. And now scientists have measured this bizarre property, which means that they might be able to control the behaviour of neutrons in future . Scientists have observed for the first time a weird quantum phenomenon known as the 'Cheshire Cat' effect (illustration shown). The 'cat' in question was a subatomic neutron particle, and the ghostly 'grin' the particle’s magnetic moment, which describes the strength of its coupling to an external magnetic field . The groundbreaking research was performed by an team at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France. The quantum Cheshire Cat follows in the paw steps of Schrodinger’s cat, the most famous feline to make an impact on the world of physics. In Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger’s celebrated 1935 thought experiment, a cat that is both alive and dead was used to illustrate the apparent paradox of quantum superposition. The imaginary experiment involved a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity, caused by the decay of a single atomic particle, the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. Theoretically the particle can be in a superposition of a decayed and non-decayed state at the same time, logically leading to the cat being both dead and alive. But this state of affairs only lasts until the box is opened. Once an observer peers inside the box, a cat that is either alive or dead is revealed. Researchers from the Vienna University of Technology performed this separation of a particle from one of its properties. The study published in Nature Communications showed that a neutron’s ‘magnetic moment’ could be measured independently of the neutron itself. The landmark observation demonstrated, for the first time, the weird quantum phenomenon known as the 'Cheshire Cat' effect. The 'cat' in question was a subatomic neutron particle, and the ghostly 'grin' the particle’s magnetic moment, which describes the strength of its coupling to an external magnetic field. In the familiar 'macro' world, the one we see all around us, an object and its properties are always bound together and inseparable. It would be crazy to imagine a rotating ball, for instance, becoming separated from its spin. Yet this is exactly what the international team of Austrian, French and US physicists managed to achieve. Using an apparatus called an interferometer, they split a beam of neutrons and sent them along two paths, each with an opposite spin - the directional preference of their magnetic moment. The experiment was set up in such a way that only neutrons with a spin parallel to their direction of motion - those travelling along an 'upper' path - were detected, a process known as 'post-selection'. Subtle tweaking and measurements using a magnetic field led to the strange conclusion of the experiment. While the physical particles themselves were observed flying along the upper path, the magnetic moment of the same particles could be detected emerging from the lower path. This is the Institut Laue-Langevin neutron source where the Quantum Cheshire Cat was created. Using an apparatus called an interferometer, the scientists split a beam of neutrons and sent them along two paths, each with an opposite spin - the directional preference of their magnetic moment . PhD student Tobias Denkmayr, from the Vienna University of Technology, said: 'By preparing the neutrons in a special initial state and then post-selecting them, we can achieve a situation in which both possible paths in the interferometer are important for the experiment. 'Along one of the paths, only an interaction with the particles themselves has an effect, but the other path is only sensitive to a magnetic spin coupling. 'The system behaves as if the particles were spatially separated from their properties.' The success of the experiment depended on making so-called 'weak measurements' that avoided the collapse of the quantum system. Just as a spun coin comes up either heads or tails when caught, different quantum properties that exist at the same time in a 'superposition' are collapsed into a single state by the act of observation. 'These weak measurements give you less information,' said Dr Hartmut Lemmel from the Institut Laue-Langevin. 'As a result you need to do lots of observations to achieve any sort of certainty that you have seen what you think you have seen.' Researchers from the Vienna University of Technology performed the first separation of a particle from one of its properties in the experiment. Pictured from left to right are Professor Yuji Hasegawa, Tobias Denkmayr, Dr Stephan Sponar, Dr Hartmut Lemmel, and Hermann Geppert . Whether the research has any practical potential remains unclear at present. One possible application could be high precision measurements of quantum systems that are often affected by disturbance. Dr Stephan Sponar, another member of the Vienna University of Technology team, said: 'Consider a quantum system that has two properties: you want to measure the first one very precisely but the second makes the system prone to perturbation. 'The two can be separated using a quantum Cheshire Cat, and possibly the perturbation can be minimised.'","Scientists separated a neutron from its magnetic moment for the first time .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . British holidaymakers are avoiding the Mallorca resort of Magaluf following its sex act shame, with last-minute bookings significantly down compared to last year. Holiday searches increased by 25 per cent in the week following reports of the 18-year-old girl who performed a sex act on 24 men to win a free cocktail. But last year saw a 39 per cent surge in bookings over the same period. The drop-off in holiday searches comes as the Spanish Tourist Office confirmed it was working with the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in an attempt to control the bad behaviour of tourists in the resort. Wild behaviour: Two young girls ride a mechanical bull at Magaluf nightclub . The Spanish Tourist Office stated:'The aim of the discussions is to agree a series of measures to encourage responsible tourism in the Balearic Island.' The tourism authority also admitted the video is damaging for the destination, which welcomes 3.3 million tourists a year. Price comparison website trivago.co.uk, which recorded the figures, confirmed that a surge in bookings is normally seen at the same time each year as families and students rush to plan a last-minute summer break. But the significant drop in interest this year could be due to families being put off by Magaluf's diminishing reputation, according to trivago. A spokesperson for the company commented: 'It suggests some visitors were dissuaded . by events in the media and perhaps the destination could benefit from . cleaning up its image.' While young holidaymakers may still be drawn to the resort, the tourism authority of Calvia, where Magaluf is situated, has passed a law to limit numbers of bar crawls in a bid to combat antisocial behaviour at the resort.

"By . Carol Driver . Travellers have said they will continue to fly with Malaysia Airlines despite the carrier's second catastrophic accident in four months. The support for the airline came after flight MH17 crashed in rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on Thursday after apparently being struck by a surface-to-air missile. All 298 passengers and crew on board, including nine Britons and 28 Australians, were killed. Support: The MA desk at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam is closed as flyers come out in support for the airline . Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 taking off from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the Netherlands yesterday . Malaysia’s Minister of Transport today defended the decision by the pilots of the doomed flight MH17 to fly over the danger zone between the US and Russia. Mr Liow Tiong Lai told a crowded press conference in Kuala Lumpur that the flight path taken by the Boeing 777 was approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and by those countries whose airspace the route passed through. ‘The International Air Transportation Association has also stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was unrestricted,’ Mr Liow said. He pointed out that 15 of 16 airlines in the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines fly the route over Ukraine. He added that European airlines also use the same route. ‘In the hours before the incident, a number of other passenger aircraft from different carriers used the same route. There was no last minute instructions given to the pilots of MH17 to change the route of the flight.’ Mr Liow said that the latest breakdown of known nationalities on board was: 173 from the Netherlands, 44 Malaysians, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, nine from the UK, 4 Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian, one New Zealander. It follows the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappearance in the Indian Ocean in March. As news broke of the latest disaster, travellers were quick to stand by the airline on its official Facebook page. Comments flooded in on the social media site - with supporters saying they wouldn't abandon the airline. One said: 'I flew with Malaysian Airlines recently to Thailand and all I can say is they were amazing!!' Another wrote: 'Loving the moonkite . symbol symbol on tail fin of MAS, my next flights from the UK out to Far . East will be with MAS, excellent airline, brilliant service, wonderful . country, honest and gentle people, wishing them a heartfelt loss, my . sincere loss for the people on MH17.' Another Malaysian poster added: 'MAS - you will always be our beloved and preferred airline.' While . another wrote: 'Don't judge the airline, I would fly with them anytime. 'This plane has been shot down, sadly the airline will be criticised by . some. Please get your facts right. 'RIP to those taken from their . families. Very sad.' Another . added: 'Sad to hear of another fatal blow to a great Airline ... despite these 2 horrific events of late blame should not be turned back . upon your organisation ... Stand tall and hold your head high ... I will . be back soon to use your great service.' Another commenter wrote: 'Travelling . with you guys next week from Auckland NZ to KL, to all crew stay strong . our thoughts are again with you. see you on thursday.'

Steering clear: Map of European airspace showing flights avoiding Ukraine after Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down . Lina . Tan tweeted: 'I will always support #MalaysiaAirlines because nothing . beats familiar friendly faces when you are away and the service is one . of the best.' However, some people demanded to know why the airline flew over disputed territory in Ukraine. On . Facebook, one poster called for the airline to be 'shut down', while . another accused it of 'complete incompetence and lack of foresight'. Malaysia Airlines flights to and from Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin and Auckland will operate as scheduled. However, the airline says all European flights will take alternative routes. A woman reacts to news regarding a Malaysia Airlines plane that crashed in eastern Ukraine at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Malaysia . 'With . immediate effect, all European flights operated by Malaysia Airlines . will be taking alternative routes avoiding the usual route,' it said.

A Qantas spokesman said its London to Dubai service used to fly over Ukraine, but the route was changed 'several months ago'. Malaysia Airlines has deployed a team of caregivers and volunteers to Amsterdam to assist family members of the deceased. 'The priority now is to get in contact with the next of kin and to take care of their wellbeing,' an airline spokesman said. Malaysia Airlines is offering a refund for passengers who wish to postpone or cancel their travel plans. 'Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets the loss of MH17, and is very much appreciative of the support from our passengers,' the carrier said in a statement.","Flyers come out in support for 'beloved' airline on its Facebook page .

"By . Kelly Rose Bradford . Pressed up against another commuter’s knees, frantically clutching the handrail as my packed train lurched towards London, my journey suddenly became even more miserable as an unmistakable odour reached my nose. For once it wasn’t the aroma of a sweaty fellow passenger — even though the sardine-tin of a carriage meant there was an armpit just inches from my face. Nor was it the malodorous whiff of someone’s breakfast. It was something much worse, a smell that mothers the world over recognise in an instant: baby poo. Scroll down for video . Malodorous whiff: Baby poo isn't something you want to smell on your journey into work . Following my nose, I peered through a throng of people to see a well-dressed, 30-something mum brazenly changing her child’s nappy on her lap, while squashed in the middle of a three-seat row. Around her, men and women in work attire shuffled their newspapers uncomfortably, and raised their eyebrows at each other across the aisle. The mum, however, remained nonchalant as she cleaned the child’s bottom with a wipe, replaced its nappy, and bagged up the soiled one, stuffing it into her designer baby-bag. Not once was there so much as an embarrassed or apologetic smile, or any acknowledgement of what she was making her fellow passengers endure. And, on a stifling hot day, being in that reeking carriage was indeed a test of endurance. I was left feeling so nauseated — not to mention outraged — that I had to move to another compartment, trying to hold my breath as I apologised and stumbled my way through the other rush-hour passengers, many grim-faced. And no, I am not some child-free career woman who does not understand the urgency of a small baby’s needs. I am a mum, and regularly took my son on trains and Tubes when he was still in nappies (cloth ones at that, which have none of the absorbency of disposables). But under no circumstances would I ever have found it acceptable to change him with people in such close proximity. Although I was shocked by what I experienced on the train, it wasn’t a one-off. I have seen mothers change nappies in full view of other customers in cafes despite there being toilets with baby-change facilities mere inches away. I have even witnessed parents pull out portable potties for toddlers to use in the middle of shops. Again, I understand that when a child needs to go, it needs to go — but there is a time and a place, and children, no matter how young, need to learn that. As do their parents. My own child, and those of most of my acquaintances, are past the nappy-wearing stage now — my son is 11 — so I thought I would have the support of most friends and colleagues when I raised the changing-in-public issue at a dinner party, and later on Facebook. Surely they would be as disgusted as I was at this total disregard for other people’s rights to travel or dine in a nappy-free zone? But no. It would seem I am quite in the minority. One colleague, a father-of-two, actually said ‘shame on you’, pointing out that as a parent I should not have had a problem with the train incident. Rather, I should be filled with sympathy for the mother. Changing time: Does a woman have the right to put her child's needs before those around her? Video courtesy of Mothercare . Other friends — while accepting that nappy changes are not exactly a pleasant spectator sport — insisted the woman was right to put her child’s needs before the sensibilities of other passengers. What tosh! If she could change the baby over her lap in her seat, she could have done so in the train lavatory, which was both clean and operational. Or, preferably, she could have waited the few minutes until we reached the terminus where toilets and baby-changing facilities are plentiful. Even when I pointed out to my critics that exposing strangers to a filthy nappy in a confined space is a potential health risk, the consensus seemed to be I had the problem, not the mum. Not impressed: Changing nappies in public is selfish and disgusting, says Kelly-Rose . When I raised the issue of the worrying implications of stripping off your child’s underwear in public, I was shouted down for being ‘paranoid’ about paedophilia. On Facebook, I was accused of being woefully out of touch. And although my nappy changing days passed a decade ago, I can not see how this revolting new practice can be viewed as progress. My mother, now 76, says she cannot believe the ‘parenting’ she witnesses daily, with children ‘ruling’ their parents, and lazy mums doing little to prevent their babies or children having a detrimental effect on other people. ‘In my day, you would have got off the train, found a public toilet, cleaned the baby up in private with soap and water, changed him and then continued on your way,’ she said. ‘We didn’t have baby-changing facilities — but didn’t make any fuss or have a sense of entitlement, either — and we certainly wouldn’t have done it in front of other people.” This phenomenon is yet another example of the might of the Mummy Mafia, where, once you have given birth, you believe you have the right to override anyone else’s comfort or needs under the guise of doing what’s ‘best’ for your child. And woe betide anyone who questions you. But of course this new breed of modern mother believes that whatever selfish act they carry out with their little prince or princess in tow is absolutely fine — because, as they will claim, baby comes first. This could be allowing it to scream a cafe down while mum chats with her pals or taps away on her phone. Or in the case of older toddlers, letting them run amok and ruin everyone else’s meal in a restaurant while mum and dad enjoy theirs in peace. We’ve all seen the mothers with their ridiculously oversized people carriers parking wherever they like with the excuse that they need the space to get their similarly proportioned prams from out of their boots. I’ve watched a mother in a walk-in medical centre shout the place down demanding to see a doctor before anyone else — for herself, not her child, as it became ‘anxious’ in waiting rooms. Baby comes first: Parents think they can get away with anything, says Kelly-Rose (posed by models) I also overheard a bored child screaming her head off in a spa when I was trying to enjoy a relaxing massage. Her mother insisted on bringing her along because she didn’t like leaving her daughter with babysitters. But no matter how much parents might try and dress up their actions as being about what’s best for their precious offspring, the truth is that essentially, this behaviour is actually all about lazy parenting. They are decisions made not in the best interest of the child, but to give the parents the easiest ride and the least amount of work. Why spend time calming your child down or walking a few hundred yards to the nearest baby-changing facility when you can sit comfortably right where you are and treat onlookers to the revolting sight and smell of your beloved little bundle’s excrement? And all this in total disregard for the fact they may be eating, or trying to enjoy a pleasant — and dare I say, fragrant — shopping expedition? Why park a few roads away from your older child’s school or the shops and walk with your toddler when you can double-park outside and then claim you had no choice because your younger child was sleeping? And why trudge the length of a railway carriage and use the perfectly adequate passenger lavatories to change your baby’s pungent nappy when you can stay in your comfy seat and do it across your lap — regardless of the fact that your actions will most likely cause your disgusted fellow passengers to part company with their breakfast?","Mothers today change their children's nappies on train seats and in cafes .

Despite once leading the way as the budget airline that takes the most money from so-called ancillary charges, Ryanair only appears in fifth place in the 2013 report. 1.  Spirit - 38% . 2.  Wizz Air - 35% . 3.  Allegiant - 33% . 4.  Jet2.com - 28% . 5.  Ryanair - 25% . 6.  Tigerair - 24% . 7.  Jetstar - 21% . 8.  AirAsia X - 20% . 9.  easyJet - 19% . 10.  AirAsia Group - 18% . It is actually beaten by Jet2, the Leeds-based budget airline, and Wizz Air, the Hungarian carrier which operates across Europe. The top carrier overall for extra charges was actually Spirit Airlines, which advertises itself as 'ultra low cost' and operates across the US, the Caribbean and Latin America. Wizz Air took second place, relying on ancillary charges for 35 per cent of its revenue, while Allegiant - a US airlines based out of Las Vegas - Jet2 and Ryanair completed the top five. Asian and Australian carriers also made it into the top 10, including Tigerair and Jetstar, with easyJet coming in ninth place, with extras equally 19 per cent of its income. The statistics show a massive increase in extra charges by airlines. In 2007, when the report was first launched, Ryanair led the way with anciallry charges representing 16 per cent of the money it took from customers. Now the top airlines, Spirit, relies on extras for 38 per cent of its money, with Ryanair raking in 25% of its cash from seat charges, baggage charges, car hire commission and food and drink. The report states: 'Spirit Airlines earns its top listing through aggressiveness. The airline is simultaneously proud of complementary objectives. It’s proud of its ability to deliver ultra-low fares for consumers, and equally proud of pushing the limit on fees. Beyond tickets: Wizz Air relies on extra charges for 35 per cent of its income . Charm offensive: Ryanair has changed some of its costs in a bid to become more customer-friendly . 'It introduced the idea of charging fees for large carry-on bags in 2010.4 That same year, the average fare charged to consumers fell to its lowest point since the carrier had changed to a low fare strategy in 2005.5 Not surprisingly, the non-ticket component (ancillary revenue) increased from $3.38 (£1.93) to $31.28 (£18.32) during the same period.' The report also quotes Ryanair boss Michael O'Learly once saying: 'The other airlines are asking how they can put up fares. We are asking how we could get rid of them.' Ryanair's drop in the tables comes amid a charm offensive by the airline after worries that it was angering customers too much with hidden costs.","Wizz Air came second in poll of airlines earning money from extra charges .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . This treetop hotel lets you live like a bird in a 'nest' made of bamboo. The ecologically sensitive concept is inspired by nests and the tipis of Native Americans and sees sleeping pods nestled among the forest canopy. Chinese architecture company Penda say the flexible design can be adapted to different surroundings and create a ‘comfortable atmosphere in a unique environment.’ Free like a bird: This nest-inspired living space allows you to sleep in pods within the trees . Using bamboo connected together with ropes, a structural grid allows ‘triangulated pots’ to be created, with size depending on intended usage. Sleeping areas can be different sizes, with larger pods for families, while there is scope for connected pots for larger functions such as a hotel lobby or restaurant and pods for a bathroom or toilet. The temporary nature of the structure also means it can be removed when not needed with no impact on the natural environment. Calming: Get close to nature by living among the trees in tipis made out of bamboo complete with their own spacious balconies . Ccologically sensitive concept: The triangular pods are inspired by nests and the tipis of Native Americans . Penda, who created the concept for the AIM 'legend of tent' competition say: ‘The structure is inspired by the tipis of native Americans, which didn’t leave any harm on the site, nor on the material itself, because the joints were connected with ropes, so the tents were easy to construct, deconstruct and carried. A truly flexible system. ‘We see the structure not just as an element which inhabits typical functions of a hotel and is connected to nature, we also see it as an element, where nature can be implemented and after a certain time, those plants can grow take over the whole structure. ‘This feeling of leaving city-life behind and getting connected to nature and experiencing our natural environment is the driving idea of our proposal’.

"By . Steve Doughty . Nearly four million immigrants swelled the population of England and Wales over just ten years, the results of the national census revealed yesterday. The grand survey of Britain, which took place in 2011, uncovers details of a decade of sweeping social change. The figures show 7.5million people who were born abroad were living here last year – of whom more than half have arrived since 2001. The results from the national headcount provide the clearest picture yet of the impact of immigration on the country over the past few years. Census officials said they mean that more than 70 per cent of the record rise in the overall population over the past decade is produced by people who migrated into Britain. Migration was a key factor in a decade of dramatic change in the make-up of the people of the country and in their beliefs, the census showed. It found that as millions arrived from abroad, traditional pillars of society were crumbling. The numbers professing to be Christians fell by four million and for the first time ever fewer than half the adult population were married. Multicultural: The number of immigrants in England and Wales has shot up as the proportion of the population that is white has decreased over the past decade, according to census data . Nearly one in eight families were . headed by a mixed race couple or had an ethnic mix of children and . adults, and in parts of London fewer than one in five people described . themselves as ‘white British’. The overall findings showed that the . share of the population who describe themselves as white has fallen to . 86 per cent, down from 91 per cent in the previous census in 2001. Four out of five people in England and Wales, 80 per cent of the population, give their ethnicity as ‘white British’. The findings published yesterday . followed the initial census results which came out in the summer and . showed that the population of England and Wales is now 56.1million. Between 2001 and 2011, numbers went up by 3.7million, or 7 per cent. The . £500million census was carried out on March 27 last year and is meant . to count everyone in the country. It said 13 per cent of people in the . country, 7.5million, were born outside Britain. ‘Those born outside the . UK represent a stable definition of a migrant,’ the census report said. Of these, 3.8million arrived after . 2001, including a high proportion who came from Poland and Eastern . Europe after Tony Blair’s government allowed free immigration when their . countries joined the EU in 2004. The census report said: ‘This means . that 71 per cent of the overall population growth in the last decade is . accounted for by the non-UK resident population.’ Home Secretary Theresa May is to make a . major speech today in which she is expected to claim that the . Government is beginning to control immigration levels. Most recent . figures show the key indicator of net migration was down ‘significantly’ over the most recent 12 months, from 242,000 to 183,000. The Migration Watch UK think-tank said . yesterday: ‘This is the clear result of Labour’s mass immigration . policy which brought nearly four million immigrants to England and Wales . in ten years. ‘Immigration on this scale is . completely unacceptable to the vast majority of the public and is . obviously unsustainable. 'Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the need . to get immigration back under control so as to allow time for . integration to occur.’ The nations where most migrants were . born are India, Poland and Pakistan, according to the census results. Irish people, who made up the biggest population of those born abroad a . decade ago, now rank fourth. In London, more than half the people in the boroughs of Brent, Newham, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea were born abroad. Over London as a whole, fewer than half the population, 45 per cent, said they were white British. However more than nine out of ten . people, 91 per cent, describe themselves as at least one of English, . Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. England remains a nation of shopkeepers more than 200 years after the phrase was coined. The most common job is working in the . retail or wholesale trade, with nearly one in six of us employed in . supplying and selling goods and services, from supermarket warehouses to . motorcycle repair shops. Health and social work is the second . work category, occupying 12.5 per cent of those in work. Education comes . next, followed by manufacturing, with 8.9 per cent of those in jobs.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Tourism authorities in Magaluf have reacted to suggestions that police are instructed to turn a blind eye to extreme sexual behaviour by tourists in the notorious Balearic resort – and are more interested in protecting the area’s infamous nightlife than clamping down on unsuitable activities. Not much left to the imagination: Magaluf has gained new notoriety in recent weeks (file picture) The Spanish sunspot, which sits in the . south-west of Mallorca, has been in the spotlight in the last fortnight . in the wake of video footage which showed a female British tourist . performing sex acts on 24 different men. Notorious: Scenes of drunkenness are common in the resort area (file picture) The incidents took place during an event organised by Carnage Magalluf – a company which runs often debauched pub crawls for young holidaymakers on the island. However, Cristian Alfaro, the head of tourism at the town hall in Calvia – the Magaluf municipality in which Magaluf is located – insists that the local police do their jobs properly. He also argues that the resort is keen to drag its image out of the gutter. ‘I don’t think anyone doubts that the police are doing their job,’ Mr Alfaro says. ‘That’s not our perception.’ ‘What happened [in the video] was not acceptable, and we don’t want out resort to be associated with this kind of behaviour.’ Mr Alfaro insists that the negative publicity can be blamed firmly on Carnage Magalluf – and that the scandal is an isolated incident rather than a sign of a wider problem. ‘This has been the irresponsible act of one rogue operator, which could damage the hard work we have been doing in the last years to promote Calvia,’ he says. Since the . video emerged, the resort has introduced a new regulation which requires . pub-crawl companies to be licensed, and keep numbers of revellers to a . maximum of 50. However, . locals in Magaluf claim that antics such as those seen in the video . are widespread, and are effectively condoned by the authorities. Party capital: Magaluf has been caught in the spotlight since the video footage emerged (file picture) ‘I . have seen British tourists have sex in front of the crowds, without any . shame,’ one taxi driver, who asked not to be named, told the Press . Association. ‘The only difference is that now mobile phones have cameras and there are social networking sites to post the footage on. ‘Part of the problem is that the local police look the other way. ‘There are a lot of hotel spaces here, and they have to be filled somehow.’ Scene: The unnamed girl was captured on video working her way through men at Alex's Bar in Magaluf . The company that organised the pub crawl has tried to distance itself from the incident. Paul Smith, head of Carnage Events Magalluf, says he was appalled by the video. 'I was disgusted by it. Disgusted by the young lady who was doing it,' he commented last week. 'I can't say that my reps encouraged that as that's not what happened. 'She should be spoken to by her parents. It's something to do with her upbringing. Asked . whether he felt any responsibility, Smith told 5 News: 'I've no moral . responsibility for this – I wasn’t even fully aware of it at the time. 'The . girl involved even bought a ticket for the following night’s Carnage . tour. Carnage didn’t encourage her, so why should I apologise?'","Spanish sunspot gained recent new notoriety when sex video went viral .

The firm said it was ‘extremely concerned’ by the tragic incident at the Anastasia Beach Hotel where staff had apparently tried to dispose of the stray poodle named Billy in a large recycling bin fitted with an electrically-operated crushing mechanism. The seven-month-old puppy was found . by holidaymakers lying at the bottom of the bin still alive, but having . suffered horrific injuries including a broken back and brain damage. Scroll down for video . Anger: British expats and tourists protest at the Anastasia hotel in Cyprus where stray puppy Billy was thrown in a crusher bin before he died . Appalled tourists called a local vet to the scene but the dog died within days. Expats . and tourists had called for a boycott of the hotel and thousands of . people have signed a petition calling for Cyprus to enforce animal . cruelty laws. Thomas . Cook said in a statement: ‘Once these allegations came to light, we . immediately liaised with the Tsokkos Hotel Group, which is offering its . full cooperation to the local authorities following the launch of a full . investigation. ‘We have been informed that the staff members involved were immediately dismissed following the incident. The . company said it had received enquiries from concerned customers, who . were subsequently told that it was an isolated incident. Antonis Alkiviades, who works at MedVets, . the surgery which cared for Billy, said: ‘When we went to the hotel, he . was already in a coma. We were shocked and it was even more of a shock . when we were told he was put into this bin.’ Mr . Alkiviades said Billy had a broken back and other broken bones and was . unable to breathe. Vets later realised he had brain damage. Billy . was visited by dozens of concerned locals and tourists. Briton Lynn . Gandy, 61, said: ‘He looked terrible. He was a poor, frail, little dog. To think somebody could throw a live animal into a crusher beggars . belief. It is savagery.’ Another woman said the local reaction to Billy’s death had been so fierce that she feared there would be riots. The seven-month-old puppy was found by holidaymakers lying at the bottom of the bin still alive, but having suffered horrific injuries, including a broken back and brain damage . On Friday, British tourists joined expats marching outside the Anastasia, which is part of the Tsokkos group, Cyprus’s largest hotel chain. They held banners with slogans reading ‘Punish people who abuse animals’ and ‘Support Billy’s Law and stop animal cruelty now’ while also chanting ‘Justice for Billy’. Ross Breakwell, from London, who was on holiday in Cyprus, said: ‘I never imagined a country within the European Union could be so lax when it comes to something as important as animal rights. ‘I’m shocked and disgusted by this incident. It will make me think twice before coming back to Cyprus and I definitely would never stay in a Tsokkos hotel. All tourists to Cyprus should boycott the company.’ Mr Alkiviades also called for tougher laws on the island. He said: ‘You have the RSPCA in the UK. We don’t. We need people to be able to reinforce laws and punish cruelty.’ Popular tourist destination: Cyprus attracts thousands of holidaymakers every year . Nicos Anastasiades, the president of Cyprus, condemned Billy’s death and described the incident as ‘a disgrace for society and our country’. Tsokkos Hotels said: ‘Hotel management received complaints from customers about the fact that a sick stray puppy wandered around. The hotel manager immediately gave instructions to two employees to take the puppy to a local shelter to obtain appropriate care. ‘Unfortunately, the employees did not follow the instructions and proceeded to an inhuman act, unacceptable and condemnable by Tsokkos Hotels. 'As soon as Tsokkos Hotels became aware of the incident, the puppy was transferred to a veterinary clinic to receive all necessary treatment.’","Hotel staff apparently put 'Billy' the poodle in a rubbish crusher .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is a longstanding stereotype that the Germans are happy to spend time naked in public, but it seems for the first time the Austrians are set to give them a run for their money. In a new poll, nearly a third of Austrian holidaymakers admitted they sunbathe in the nude on their travels - the same number as their German neighbours. When questioned about their holiday habits, 28 per cent of travellers from both nations said they were happy to bare all at the beach. Buff guide to sunbathing: Germans are still the most likely to go naked while on holiday, research reveals . According to Expedia's annual . Flip Flop report, which surveyed the behaviours and preferences of . 12,000 holidaymakers across 24 countries in five continents, Europeans were the most at home with nudity on holiday. European women are more likely to go topless than women from other parts of the world, with nearly half of Austrians (49 per cent) likely to sunbathe topless. Spaniards and Germans followed closely behind, with 42 per cent and 39 per cent respectively saying they were happy to ditch their bikini top at the beach. In comparison, puritanical Britons and Americans are much less comfortable with holidaying in the nude. While just 12 per cent of Britons will strip off at the beach, a slightly more adventurous 13 per cent of Americans while sunbathe in the buff. Worldwide, beach nudity is more common among men (18 per cent) than women (6 per cent). And while the global average for nudity was just 12 per cent, Germans and Austrians bucked the trend, with 28 per cent of holidaymakers saying they're happy to sunbathe naked. The most modest beachgoers were from Asia, with only 2 per cent of Japanese, 3 per cent of South Korean and 4 per cent of Thai beachgoers admitting to have sunbathed nude. Still the tops: Beach holidays are still voted the most-favoured destination . But being modest didn't translate into being uncomfortable with the practice, however. Nearly . three-quarters of Japanese beachgoers said they were 'very' or . 'somewhat' comfortable with beach nudity or female toplessness. The Spanish weren't far behind, with 74 per cent saying they are happy with nudity on the beach. But just 29 per cent of Hong Kong residents accepted naked bathers on holiday, with just 28 per cent comfortable with the practice in India and 34 per cent in Malaysia. And it's not all about nude sunbathing. Brazilians showed they are happy to strut their stuff in miniature swimsuits, with 95 per cent saying they are happy to wear a Speedo on the beach. The Austrians weren't far behind, with 94 per cent happy to don a pair of 'budgie smugglers', followed by 91 per cent of Germans and Spanirads. The least likely to . approve of Speedos were Norwegians, with just 40 per cent considering it . acceptable attire. As for Americans, 57 per cent were fine with Speedos. Making a splash: The Brazilians are most likely to don a Speedo, while Spanish women are happy to go topless . The beach remains one of the most popular travel destinations in the world, with the report showing that more than half (56 per cent) of those surveyed said they had taken a beach vacation in the past year. Meanwhile 73 per cent of those who had taken, or planned to take, a beach holiday said they had achieved 'personal bliss' as a result. 'The beach . is the world's most popular travel destination by a considerable . margin,' said John Morrey, vice president and general manager of . Expedia.com, . 'So . every year we ask travellers all over the world to tell us their likes . and dislikes as they relate to beach behaviour.'

Brazil may not have won the World Cup, but it has banked £9billion from the event, according to the latest statistics . During the whole competition, the  social networking site recorded more than three billion interactions about the World Cup. In total, around 3.6 billion people around the world watched the final, staged at Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã stadium. And the five other games played at the same Rio stadium were the best-attended throughout the tournament. It is estimated the World Cup has contributed a total of £9 billion to the Brazilian economy, according to research from the Institute of Economic Research Foundation . (FIPE) commissioned by the Ministry of Tourism. Going off with a bang: Despite initial fears, the World Cup was declared an overall success for foreign visitors . Brazil's minister for sport Luis Fernandes said: 'The main legacy was how we learned to combine an organised environment with an atmosphere of celebration. In order to do this, we had to guarantee the quality of necessary services, which came about through a long and thorough process of cooperation. 'This is the key that has allowed us, in the final evaluation, from an operational point of view, to say that the Cup was a complete success.' Vicente Neto, president of Embratur, added: 'The latest tourism figures verify how much of a success the 2014 FIFA World Cup has been for Brazil.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is one of the great relationship clichés of the modern age. Men do the getting lost, and women do the trickier business of finding the way back to where they were supposed to be in the first place while hubby refuses to ask for directions and shouts at the sat-nav. But, according to a new survey, it seems . that both sexes are equally adept at misplacing their bearings – . especially when they are on holiday. Where are we now, where are we now? Britons spend 22 million years lost on holiday every year . Research conducted by O2 Travel has discovered that, across the space of a year, Britons – both men and women – spend some 22million hours bemused as to where they are. This, it seems, is a 21st century phenomenon, pinned to our increasing obsession with our smartphones, and our reliance upon them. The study revealed that only six per cent of us ever leave home in the UK without our trusty mobile tucked into a bag or pocket – but only 14 per cent of us carry our phones with us when out and about on a foreign holiday, preferring to leave them in the hotel. This leads to scenarios where – suddenly unable to whip out a phone and check our exact locations in an unfamiliar environment – we wander around clueless. Checking in: Smartphones are a key part of our lives - but 86 per cent of us leave them in our hotel . According to the survey, the main cause of this phone-phobia while overseas is a fear of running up enormous bills thanks to data roaming charges or long phone calls. ‘People use their mobiles as a source of information on a daily basis,’ says Nina Bibby of O2. ‘We believe it should be no different when they are on holiday.’ Other interesting nuggets thrown out by the survey include the revelation that one of the pet British peeves while on holiday is having to deal with rude tourists at their destination – a source of aggravation cited by 24 per cent of those questioned. Unfamiliar food was also listed as a cause for concern, with over one in five people – 21 per cent – declaring foreign dishes to be ‘unappetising’.","British tourists increasingly rely on their smartphones, research says .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . It is often said that the past is a foreign country - but in these vibrant images it comes one step closer to reality. The original scenes they show - captured only in black and white at the time due to technological restraints - have been reimagined and given new life. These coloured scenes were created from original archive photographs by artist Dana Keller. Some, such as Albert Einstein, Audrey Hepburn and the famous crash of the Hindenburg Zeppelin in 1936 are instantly recognisable, while others, such as portraits of Adolf Hitler and Virginia Woolf, give a new perspective on some of the best-known figures of past centuries. The images were coloured, using digital techniques, by Mr Keller, 27, who lives in Boston. The images can take anywhere from a few hours to straightforward shots to days for more complicated scenes. Class in colour: Film star and style icon Audrey Hepburn is pictured in her kitchen preparing breakfast in the original to the left, and again to the right in detailed colour . Catastrophe: The Hindenburg, an airship filled with flammable hydrogen, is pictured in an iconic photograph to the left crashing in flames on May 6 1937 - but the flames look even more vivid in the coloured version to the right . Genius move: Artist Dana Keller spends hours - sometimes days - painstakingly adding colour to the old images, such as this 1921 picture of physicist Albert Einstein . He said: 'The addition of colour can help connect people to history. With black and white photos, people tend to feel distant and disconnected from the real and vibrant world those photos are actually portraying. 'By adding color to these photos, it makes them seem more familiar, and the viewer is brought a little closer to the reality in which they were taken. 'What I do want to make clear, however, is that colorizations are done out of a respect and reverence for history. They are not meant to be replacements- the originals are still here for us all to see and enjoy and preserve for the future.' Relic of art: Claude Monet is pictured above in First World War France, next to a panel of his famous Water Lilies series . Coloured in: The representation of the works, which now sell for millions and are displayed the world over, has been rendered more vividly in colour . Fuhrer: The photograph, left, of Adolf Hitler in an unusually relaxed pose - as he receives news of German territory expanding - looks even more human thanks to colour. Ms Keller says her process makes pictures 'seem more familiar' Flying ace: Baron Captain Manfred von Richthofen, pictured left in 1917, was better-known as The Red Baron. The First World War fighter pilot can be seen with more sharpness and detail too in the coloured version .

"By . Martin Robinson . Freddie Starr has stormed out of a television interview after he was asked whether his behaviour during his 50-year career 'could have been misrepresented' as sexual abuse. The 71-year-old TV entertainer was furious with Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid and ordered her to leave his home. Last week he was released from bail more than 18 months after his first arrest for sex offences, an ordeal which left him suicidal and a physical wreck. The comedian today said he walked away from the interview because he felt 'persecuted'. Scroll down for video . Anger: Freddie Starr walked out of an interview broadcast today after being asked whether his behaviour had ever been 'misinterpreted' by women . Upsetting: Mr Starr repeatedly asked Susanna Reid is she was 'serious' after she asked him about the abuse claims. When she said 'yes' he ripped off his microphone and left . Demand: The comedian also told the presenter to leave his house immediately - but later returned with his wife to continue the interview . In a pre-recorded interview broadcast this morning Starr ordered Good Morning . Britain presenter Susanna Reid to leave after she asked whether . he had done 'anything that could have been misinterpreted' in his past . relationships. 'Are you being serious?', Starr replied, before removing his microphone and walking out of the room. The veteran comic later returned with his wife Sophie to continue the interview. 'It's hard to have an interview like this with it being so raw,' Starr told the programme. 'I've only been released three days ago, I'm just catching up on my sleep.' On Twitter today he wrote: 'I’ll always stand by my principles, I’ve been persecuted for almost 2 years and I wouldn’t allow to (be) persecuted again on @GMB. 'The police unturned every stone, I wouldn’t of been let go if there was sufficient evidence. Still now I feel I am being persecuted!'. Return: Starr came back with his wife Sophie, who said the investigation had scarred him, and left him scared to cuddle his own daughter . Row: Mr Starr had asked Ms Reid 'are you serious?' and she said 'yes', so he ended the interview . Anger: Freddie Starr used Twitter to justify why he had walked away from the Good Morning Britain interview . Starr, 71, was first arrested in November 2012, then rearrested three further times in April last year and January and February this year. But the case against him was dropped this week when prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of 13 women that he molested them up to 40 years ago, which he has always denied. After looking frail in a press conference outside his home in Studley, Warwickshire last week, Starr has said having the case hanging over him has taken a devastating toll on his health, and also appeared to slur his words at times during today's broadcast interview. Starr, who says he has suffered four . heart attacks in the past, said the sleepless nights and stress hit his . health and left him considering suicide. His . wife Sophie Lea, 33, has been looking after him and, at one point, had . to check on him regularly to ensure he didn't try to take his own life. During today's interview, Starr claims that he did not know the women who made the complaints against him, branding them 'ghosts'. He insists he has been 'innocent all along' and felt the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) wanted to 'put something there'. 'If they could've prosecuted me - they certainly would've done,' he said. He added: 'You shouldn't be named until you are charged'. Struggle: Freddie Starr outside his home in Warwickshire last week week after the CPS confirmed that he will not be charged as part of Operation Yewtree due to insufficient evidence . Compensation: Starr (right), 71, and his lawyer Dean Dunham (left), both said he would mount a legal case against police . Starr, pictured at his home after his first arrest in 2012, says his 18 months on bail have been 'mental torture', which has wrecked him physically and mentally . Starr also distanced himself from Mx Clifford, who achieved widespread fame with his links to The Sun's infamous Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster story, after the PR guru was jailed for eight years earlier this month for a string of indecent assaults. 'Max Clifford was a different animal,' Starr said. 'I didn't like Max Clifford - I didn't go out with him, I didn't do anything with him.' Starr was the second celebrity to be . arrested by Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree when he was held on . November 1, 2012. He was re-bailed nine times as the controversial . investigation engulfed a series of celebrities. The . comedian accused police and prosecutors of ‘playing dirty’ by . associating him with known paedophiles Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter. He . suspects the announcement of charges being dropped was delayed by the . Clifford case, because his notorious front page story – ‘Freddie Starr . ate my hamster’ – featured in the evidence. But . prosecutors insist they only made their final decision at the end of . last week and did not receive a full case file from police until March. Freddie Starr and his wife Sophie in 2011.

Comedian Starr at the height of his fame, pictured two decades ago in 1997 (left) and 1995 (right) Starr's wife Sophie, 33, says her husband was scared to cuddle his own daughter during the Operation Yewtree investigation into him. 'It's changed him as a man,' she says. 'It's like even the little things like with his daughter, at one point he was scared to even cuddle her because you've got the world judging you. 'I know Freddie will come back from this. 'I would say he is one of the most caring, gentle men that you can ever meet. He'd do anything for anybody. And the fact is that for him to be accused of this, thank God it is now over, people can start to see the true Freddie and not the person that was portrayed in the media because it's not him at all.'

"By . Alison Smith Squire . Animal charities, including the RSPCA and Battersea Dogs & Cats, have gone into 'partnership' with Pets At Home and animals are being sold in stores for an 'adoption fee' Rescue dogs and cats from some of Britain’s biggest animal charities are being sold from the giant pet store chain Pets At Home. After years of campaigning for dogs and cats not to be sold in pet shops, charities such as the RSPCA and Battersea Dogs & Cats have gone into ‘partnership’ with the UK’s biggest pet supermarket, and some animals – including cats – are on display in pens at stores, where they can be purchased for an ‘adoption fee’. The partnerships are a coup for Pets At Home, which earned £600 million last year and was last week floated on the stock market for £1.23 billion. The company, which boasts that it raises tens of thousands of pounds in donations for animal charities every year, is planning an expansion programme in the UK, aiming to operate more than 500 stores, 700 veterinary practices and 300 dog grooming outlets. But as Cats Protection became the latest animal charity to announce a ‘partnership’ with Pets At Home, the deals were slammed as ‘irresponsible’ and ‘appalling.’ Vet Mike Jessop, a past president of the British Small Animal Veterinary Association, said: ‘Selling animals from a pet store is an appalling idea. Animal welfare organisations have fought for years to keep dogs and cats out of pet shops and you no longer see puppies and kittens in shop windows. ‘So this is a huge step backwards. I am also very concerned that shoppers will be encouraged to buy a pet on the spur of the moment. And I feel uncomfortable about cats being kept in pens in what will surely be stressful conditions. Confined to a pen for too long, they can become depressed.’ Cats Protection is to open its first rehoming centre at the supermarket’s branch in Newbury, Berkshire, next month. Cats will be displayed in pens provided by the supermarket  to the charity’s specifications. Shoppers will be able to choose a cat and, after paying an ‘adoption fee’, return the next day to pick it up. Cats Protection also hopes to sell its own branded merchandise in the store. If successful, the scheme could be rolled out to at least four other Pets At Home stores. Meanwhile, both the RSPCA and Battersea Dogs & Cats have opened Pets At Home rehoming centres over the past 18 months. But the move has come under criticism. Vet Mike Jessop, a past president of the British Small Animal Veterinary Association, said: 'Selling animals from a pet store is an appalling idea. Animal welfare organisations have fought for years to keep dogs and cats out of pet shops and you no longer see puppies and kittens in shop windows. So this is a huge step backwards' Feelings are running high among Cats Protection’s 8,500 unpaid volunteers who have flooded the charity’s private forums. One said: ‘The thought of cats being screamed at by unruly kids with parents who will get them one to appease them, is frightening. It feels wrong and irresponsible.’ Cats Protection said it hopes that the move will ‘bring the message of responsible cat ownership to a wider audience’, adding: ‘The cats will be safeguarded in the same way as  the cats in our care, ensuring  people cannot buy on impulse.’ Pets At Home said: ‘We always put pets before profit and make no money from this partnership. We offer store space free of charge to certain charities to allow them to carry out their much-needed rehoming work.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘All animals rehomed via Pets At Home are done so in accordance with the charity’s strict adoption procedures.’ A Battersea spokesman said: ‘We are happy to work with this major retailer as it enables us to reach some of their customers who may not previously have considered rehoming an animal from a rescue centre.’","Pets At Home has gone into partnership with charities including the RSPCA, Cats Protection and Battersea Dogs & Cats .

"It's not exactly a competition for the faint-hearted, but let's hope there was no sting in the tale for any of these brave bee beard growers. The remarkably daring men and women have got Ontario all abuzz after taking part in the tenth annual Clovermead Bee Beard Competition. The contest sees four teams of competitors entice swarms of bees to the head and torso of a 'beard grower' before two winners are chosen by the audience and the official judges.

Each team consists not only of the beard model, but also a 'bee whisperer', who is able to groom the flying insects into the required shape. Beebearding is thought to date back to the 1700s when an English beekeeper discovered he could create a beard of bees by tying the queen to a thread around his neck and would parade through the streets wearing the unusual costume. At the Clovermead competition however, once in place, the beards are weighed before each wearer goes on to strut their stuff and perform a little dance in front of the watching crowds. The Bee Beard Champion is then chosen by judges, while the audience is also able to pick their Crowd Favourite.

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Residents have compared piles of rotting fish and crabs washed up on an idyllic Western Australian beach to having a sewerage dump near Uluru or the Sydney Opera House. Jurien Bay is located on the state's mid west coast about 220 kilometres north of Perth and has experienced the problem since 2000. Resident Ian Stiles helped set up the Jurien Bay Marine Park and was the former owner of a dive shop and 23-person passenger dive boat and said the situation was bad news for local tourism. 'It's ridiculous going to a tourist icon and having to pass by all these rotting fish and the horrible smell,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Fish and crab kills have been occurring in Jurien Bay for about 14 years with worst, pictured, in October and November last year . Aquatic life including fish, crabs and even stingrays are killed when seaweed becomes trapped in the bay and releases toxic hydrogen sulfide . 'It smells worse than Indonesia harbour Tanjung Priok and that's in a Third World country.' 'It's like having a sewerage dump next to Uluru or the Sydney Opera House.' Mr Stiles estimates about 90 per cent of people accessing the marine park go through Jurien Bay and said the people who bought his boat business three years ago had since gone broke due to the problem. He knows of other residents and business owners who moved from the tourist hotspot to other towns because of the problem. 'There are blue manna crabs laying on the sea floor - if they were anywhere else there would be birds everywhere,' he said. Mr Stiles blames a marina built in the bay in 1988 and its lack of maintenance for causing the problem. Resident Ian Stile believes a marina built in Jurien Bay, pictured, in 1988 and a lack of maintenance are to blame for the problem as it causes polluted water to stay trapped . Mr Stiles said the smell of the rotting fish and crabs was worse than ports in Tanjung Priok in Indonesia (pictured) Hundreds of fish can wash up during the fish kills causing a foul smell and turning tourists away from the bay and nearby marine park . He said the marina caused a build up of sand at its mouth and resulted in seaweed getting stuck in the bay after storms. As it rots releases hydrogen sulfide, which deprives water of oxygen and kills masses of fish and crabs. 'It's called rotten egg gas,' he said of the smell. 'We need it brought back to its 1988 design specifications and then dredged every three to four years,' he said. 'If we dredge it out regularly we would possibly not have this problem.' 'Dead fish at the bottom of the marina are causing pathogens,' he added and said the problem had also killed other marine life such as stingrays. He said an engineering-based solution at the marina's narrow entrance and ongoing maintenance was needed to prevent polluted water getting trapped in the bay. The worst fish kill in recent history was last October, but on Sunday August 2, residents have again faced the horrendous sight and smell of rotting aquatic life. While the bulk of dead animals wash up in the first days of a fish kill, it can still take weeks for remaining animals at the bottom of the bay to wash up . The state's Department of Health is warning people not to swim in bay or eat fish caught in it, reported the ABC. Health concerns caused by hydrogen sulfide include head aches, mild anxiety and nausea, the department said. Mr Stiles said while most of the dead sea animals that washed up just over a week ago were cleaned up straight away using Bobcats and small trucks, there were still some dead fish washing up. The West Australian Department of Health issued a warning advising people not to swim in Jurien Bay or eat fish caught in it . Mr Stiles is president of Jurien Bay Marina Action Group, formed following the 2013 fish kill, and said the bay was last dredged 2006 but this was not sufficient to fix the problem. He said the first time hydrogen sulfide was released in the bay was 1998, but it was not until 2000 that the first major fish kill happened. Another problem caused by the release of the gas is pitting of brass and stainless steal. 'Boats had to be brought of the water last October and November because of the problem,' he said. Mr Stiles blames previous West Australian governments for not acting on the issue sooner but said the recent fish kills were leading to the first action on the issue since 2000. Moore State Nationals MP Shane Love raised the issue affecting the bay and its community in parliament fol following the 2013 fish kill. As a result former transport minister Troy Buswell committed to dredging the marina while working to establish a long-term solution to the problem. The Department of Transport is using wave and wind monitoring cameras at the marina to collection information about the problem. Sand is currently being excavated in the marina's channel to allow a better flow of water and prevent seaweed from getting trapped and triggering issue. Mr Love said a major dredging program was expected to start later this year to alleviate the situation in the short-term. 'It will provide for a healthier environment for some time to come but the problem will continue to occur if we don't get on top of the movement of sand and seagrass into the harbour itself,' he said. The Department of Transport will monitor water quality in the bay while environmental and planning approvals are in being sought to enable dredging works to start.

"By . Duncan Farmer . When Patti and David Bailey appeared on Dragons’ Den seeking investment for Motormouse, the company  they ran from their 17th Century manor house in the Warwickshire countryside, the business took off. With the profits from selling their computer mice  in the shape of classic cars, they were able to transform the four-bedroom house and complete a renovation they started in 2002. The money enabled them to add a steam room, hot tub, one-bedroom apartment over the triple garage, a vast conservatory and a helipad that doubles as a putting green and croquet lawn. The four-bedroom 17th Century Wheetley Manor House in Warwickshire, also comes with a one-bedroom flat above the triple garage . ‘It had originally been three farmworkers’ cottages, apparently housing 28 people, but  in the 19th Century the Earl of Evesham claimed it, kicked them out, turned it into a single home and called it the Manor House,’ says Patti, 56, who runs her own business as a consultant to the building industry. ‘On the night Dragons’ Den went out, our website received 3,500 hits per second, and the company that hosted the site thought we were under cyber attack and shut it down – until they realised they were real customers,’ says David, 57. The firm was born after a party for which Patti baked a cake topped with a Corgi  model of a Bentley Continental GT – David’s dream car. ‘A couple of days later I was sitting at my desk rolling the car up and down and it struck me that it was just like moving a mouse,’  said David. He tried to find a firm that made car-shaped mice, but when he couldn’t, he started Motormouse. Spacious: The £1.25million property's summer house overlooks the garden lake . Modern interior: The current owners, entrepreneurial couple Patti and David Bailay, have made sure the house is in shipshape . Paying off: Since their success with Motormouse, the Baileys have been able to add  a hot tub, one-bedroom apartment over the triple garage, a vast conservatory and a helipad/putting green . That was five years ago. The business quickly outgrew the Manor House in Wheethley, near Alcester, in the middle of the 3,000-acre Ragley Estate close  to the Worcestershire border. Now the house has outgrown Patti and David, and they want to move. ‘We want to downsize,’ says David, who is not a man to sit still for long, and did much of the work on the house himself. ‘We’ve always bought and renovated houses, and now I’d like to build one from scratch  and project manage it myself.’ Moving on: David and Patti Bailey are selling to downsize . Selling the house, which is on the market with Fine & Country for £1.25 million, should not be too difficult. As well as the immaculate accommodation, it has delightful gardens and spectacular views. Its two acres of land include a summer house in the style  of a Bajan rum shack and a vast lake, which is home to the couple’s pets – two ducks and two geese – and is stocked with fish. Jonathan Handford, of Fine & Country,  says the local market has performed steadily and he is confident of finding a buyer. ‘House prices have gone up 4.8 per cent in Warwickshire in the past 12 months,’ he adds. He adds that there is interest from people  in Stratford-upon-Avon, which is 12 miles away, who want to be further out ‘in the sticks’, as well as people moving from London who want to hide away in the country but still need good commuter access  to Birmingham (20 minutes by car) and  to airports. While the house is for sale, so is the business, and the couple are in talks with several buyers. ‘We only ever intended  to run it for five years and  I now have another idea  that I’m discussing  with big retailers,’  says David. The couple say for the past five years they have been helping former dragon James Caan sift through hundreds of entrepreneurs who approach him every week.  ‘We became mini dragons,’ says Patti. fineandcountry.co.uk .","The Baileys invented the Motormouse and went on Dragons' Den .

"By . Associated Press . Russia's troop buildup on the Ukrainian border increases the threat of an invasion by President Vladimir Putin's army, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said today. Speaking to reporters at U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, Hagel said he agrees with Poland's foreign minister, who said Wednesday that the increase in Russian forces near Ukraine's border heightened the risk of an invasion. 'I think it's a reality, of course it is,' said Hagel, who was in Stuttgart for meetings with his military leaders in Europe, including the top commander, Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove. Columns of tractors with self-propelled artillery on the highway in Russia are pictured heading towards the Russian-Ukrainian border on July 31st . 'When you see the build-up of Russian troops and the sophistication of those troops, the training of those troops, the heavy military equipment that's being put along that border, of course it's a reality, it's a threat, it's a possibility - absolutely,' Hagel said. U.S. and NATO officials say there are now about 20,000 Russian troops massed just east of Ukraine's border. The U.S. also says Russia continues to train and equip separatists battling Ukraine's government. Russia has repeatedly rejected Ukrainian and Western claims of a military buildup on the border. 'The longer that Russia perpetuates and instigates this tension and the possibility of escalating their activity, it's going to get worse. And we have to be prepared for that,' Hagel said. Among the scenarios that worry some in NATO is Putin potentially sending Russian troops into eastern Ukraine in the guise of a 'peacekeeping' force. That concern has deepened as the Russian-supported separatists appear to lose the initiative against Ukrainian governme . Ukrainian army tanks pictured moving past a checkpoint as they patrol the area near eastern Ukrainian town of Debaltseve on Sunday . Hagel also said that Russia's provocative actions are forcing the U.S. and its allies to take a close look at how NATO is structured and prepared for such military crises and other challenges of the future. U.S. officials have talked about the need to set up a more robust and ready NATO military response force. That is likely to be one of the subjects discussed at the NATO summit in September. Sir Adrian Bradshaw, the British army general who is NATO's No. 2 officer, said last week the alliance needs a more responsive quick-reaction force that could be deployed in the event Moscow makes aggressive military threats against a NATO nation. Breedlove in June told reporters that NATO needs 'to have a much more responsive force to address this new threat that we see.' He said the allies will consider where the force should be positioned and whether it should move in and out on a rotational basis or remain in the region as long as needed. He said he has recommended that NATO consider pre-positioning military equipment in the region, but no final decisions have been made yet.

"By . Associated Press . The crew aboard a New Zealand fishing boat on Thursday hauled up a surprising and gruesome catch: a small plane with a body inside. Authorities suspect the plane is a 5.7 metre aerobatic biplane that was home-assembled from a kit and flown by missing Auckland pilot Daroish Kraidy. The crew of the San Kawhai was trawling for fish when they brought up the wreckage in the boat's nets at about 10am, said Trish Sherson, a spokeswoman for fishing company Sanford. The wreckage of a plane is hauled onto a fishing boat off the southern point of Great Barrier Island near Auckland, New Zealand, on Thursday . The wreckage was later hoisted aboard a police boat which late Thursday was headed back to Auckland. Police said the plane was severely damaged and that a detailed inspection of it will be carried out Friday by officials that include a victim identification expert. Typically, trawl nets are dragged in a wide arc along the ocean floor to ensnare fish. Buoyancy can make it easier to lift heavy objects in the water than on land. The 18.5 metre fishing vessel is one of Sanford's smaller boats and typically catches tarakihi, orange roughy and other fish that live near the coast. Kraidy's Acro Sport plane is the only plane listed as missing by New Zealand's Civil Aviation Authority. Authority spokesman Mike Richards said the Acro is relatively lightweight and is made with a metal and wood frame that's covered by fabric. Authorities suspect the plane is a 5.7 meter aerobatic biplane that was home-assembled from a kit and flown by missing Auckland pilot Daroish Kraidy . Kraidy, 53, took off March 25 from Ardmore airfield near Auckland. Minutes later, his plane disappeared from radar screens, leading authorities to conclude he either switched off the plane's transponder or was flying at a very low altitude. Kraidy had previously flown in the World Precision Flying Championships. His ex-wife and daughter told Fairfax Media in May they believed his disappearance was deliberate after he had battled depression for years. His ex-wife noted some similarities to the disappearance 17 days earlier of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, with 239 passengers and crew on board. That plane has not been found. Fishermen on Thursday transported the wreckage to a bay near Great Barrier Island, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) northeast of Auckland, where they met police. Police said they were in contact with Kraidy's family and friends about the discovery.","New Zealand fishing boat hauled a small plane with body on Thursday .

"By . James Slack . Updated: . 09:06 EST, 31 January 2012 . A crime guide enabling residents to check if their railway station, shopping centre, supermarket or park is a hotspot for muggings or other offences went live today. Police have delivered a huge expansion of the Home Office crime mapping website – which proved so popular when it launched last year it went into meltdown. Other public spaces have been added to the www.police.uk maps include sports grounds, theatres, hospitals and even the areas outside police stations and prisons. While nightclubs aren't named, people in the locality will know where crimes have taken place . The crime maps are now more specific with details of the type of venue that an offence happened . Transport hubs like train stations, airports and docks are included in the updated crime map . From today the public can use the maps to check on venues and destinations where they may wish to take extra care. Ministers hope it will help to drive up police standards. Visitors to the site simply type a postcode or address and search for crimes that have happened nearby with a breakdown of the types of offences that have been committed. The changes that have taken place today will mean that searches are more specific and people will be able to work out where particular crimes have taken place. Month by month comparisons can be made for crimes in particular areas but the location-specific searches are only available for December 2011. Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘Armed with the information from those crime maps, people can attend their local neighbourhood beat meeting and hold their local police to account for their performance.’ Currently, homeowners can check for details of crimes reported to the police on residential streets. It allows anyone in England and Wales to enter their postcode and find out police records of burglary, robbery, violence, vehicle crime and anti-social behaviour. Police stations, like this one in Liverpool, have been included in the list of crime venues . Disorder: The police crime map gives a detailed street-by-street breakdown of where crime happens. However, there have been questions about its accuracy after a string of blunders . In Portsmouth there was anger and ridicule when . Surrey Street (pictured) - showed it having, in December alone, 136 crimes, . including burglary, violence and anti-social behaviour. In fact there were only two . Previously, crimes were mapped to an . anonymous point on a street with 12 or more postal addresses. From . today, it will include streets containing as few as eight addresses. It . will give information about railway stations and police will also begin . the process of adding other public areas. These will include airports, bus and coach stations, ferry terminals, . motorway service stations, petrol stations, nightclubs, police stations, . sports and recreation areas, race tracks, theme parks, parking areas . and pedestrian subways. Officers will also add further and higher education buildings, shopping . areas, supermarkets, theatre and concert halls, conference and . exhibition centres, hospitals, prisons, and parks and other open spaces. Not all the information will be available immediately, but the process . will get under way from today. In the longer-term, pubs could also be . added to the list. In the case of a nightclub, the map will show the location of the . building, but only the word ‘nightclub’, rather than its name. Those . living nearby will be expected to know the name of the venue. Nick Herbert, minister for policing, said: ‘The public appetite is clear with 453million hits to the website since its launch. ‘Information is power – and crime mapping helps transfer power back to local people.’ From May, the website will also begin to carry details of what happens . after a crime has occurred in terms of a response or a conviction.On the . day of its launch last January, the crime map website came doubly . unstuck within hours. First, a string of errors meant leafy streets with just a handful of . incidents ranked alongside the worst urban crime zones in Britain, . leaving residents venting their fury. Then, to add to embarrassment over . the £300,000 site, the Home Office was forced to pull the plug when it . crashed under the strain of 18million hits an hour. Numbers game: How the crime map shows offences in Newcastle . Since then, it has proved hugely popular with the public – but has also . attracted criticism in some quarters. A recent survey claimed thousands . of crimes go unreported because victims fear the information will damage . house prices. The launch of the new website comes as police yesterday claimed they . will suffer ‘financial hardship’ after Mrs May forged ahead with plans . to axe £150million from their annual pay and perks. Officers will get to keep – for now – a controversial competence-related . payment known as ‘grab-a-grand’ because it is paid to so many officers. The payments, worth up to £1,200, are aimed at constables at the top of . their pay scale who can only earn more money by being promoted. A . premium rate of time and a third will also be kept for casual overtime. But a so-called ‘special priority payment’, which costs the taxpayer . around £90million a year, will be axed. Normally worth up to £3,000, . these are handed out as a reward for dealing with ‘specially demanding . working conditions’. This was recommended for the chop in a review of police pay and . conditions by lawyer Tom Winsor – who said savings worth up to £1billion . could be made overall. Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation, said: ‘Whichever way . you dress it up, this will mean serious financial hardship for police . officers.’ Dangerous street: Guildhall Walk in Portsmouth topped the list for violent crimes .","Scheme branded 'Crimebotch' after it crashed when 18million people an hour tried to log on last year .

Ben Foster hailed the consistent goal power of Wayne Rooney after the England striker scored his first international goal since October but his 11th in 18 games under Roy Hodgson. Rooney scored England’s first in last night’s 2-2 draw against Ecuador in Miami from his unfamiliar position on the left wing. 'We wanted some good individual performances and we got them,' said Foster. 'We got a good goal from Wayne as well. That’s what Wayne does. He scores us goals, simple as that. Opener: Wayne Rooney (right) scores England's first goal against Ecuador and celebrates (below) Wide boy: Rooney played on the left of midfield against Ecuador . 'Some of the other lads put a good shift in as well. It was a good work-out. It would have been nice to get a win but a draw is not too bad. The manager was satisfied. It was more about the work-out really.' It was Foster’s first cap for a year and his first start for nearly four. 'It was great to play for England again,' said the goalkeeper. 'It was my first game for a year or so. If you can’t enjoy games like that, playing for England, just before the World Cup, there’s something wrong. I had a fantastic time and really enjoyed it.' Both teams finished the game with 10-men. Raheem Sterling and Antonio Valencia were sent off in the 78th minute. Sterling, who had only been on the pitch for 14 minutes, was dismissed for a rash tackle on the Ecuador captain, who was also dismissed for retaliation. Safe hands: Ben Foster made his first England start in four years on Wednesday . No chance: Foster could do nothing to stop Michael Arroyo equalising for Ecuador . Hand it to him: Foster was delighted to back playing for England a year after his last appearance . 'I’m surprised all round,' said Foster. 'I didn’t think it was a red card for Raheem and I played for a few years with Antonio and he’s not that kind of guy.' Sterrling will be banned from Saturday’s friendly against Honduras in Miami but will be clear to play in the World Cup. It was not looking so good for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain who looked dejected as he hobbled out of the Sun Life Stadium amid fears he had damaged knee ligaments. 'We’ll have to wait and hope for the best,' said Foster.","Wayne Rooney scored the opener in England's 2-2 draw with Ecuador .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A cat's grey and white fur was dyed pink after it got covered by dye when it walked through an industrial estate. Casper the cat was left looking just like Bagpuss when he came home after his run-in with the dye at an estate near his owner's home in Eastwood, Essex. His owner, Jayne Richardson, 40, said her pet looked just like the 1970s children's TV star when he came home shamefaced, and covered in dye, on Saturday. Snap! Casper the cat looked like 1970s children's TV favourite, Bagpuss, right, after his run-in with red dye . Covered: Casper's owner managed to catch him before he trailed red ink through their home in Eastwood, Essex . Jayne Richardson washed Casper in her bath but then had to take him to the vet for a more professional clean . She followed a trail of red dye on bushes which led her to puddles of the 'gloopy liquid' on the nearby Progress Road industrial estate. A scrub in the bath only removed some of the dye, so Casper was taken to the vet for a £50 power wash. But a pink tinge still remains, leaving her pet, whom Mrs Richardson describes as 'a bit dumb', looking more like Bagpuss than ever. Mrs Richardson, a shop assistant, said: 'He's an amazing sight - he looks just like Bagpuss. 'We were very upset about what happened - he ingested the ink, too, and it made his poo go read. 'We're very lucky that our house wasn't ruined - my husband managed to contain Casper before he got the ink all over our carpets and furnishings. 'I'm very worried about him in case he's been poisoned, but he's okay at the moment.' She added: 'I don't believe in keeping animals indoors but I can't let him out now.  It's all very traumatic.' Mrs Richardson's cat is still pink despite being professionally cleaned; a trail of dye shows where he'd been . Beloved cat: Bagpuss starred in the children's TV show of the same name, which also featured squeaky mice . Mrs Richardson says fly tipping is to blame, and says other cats and foxes have been seen locally with the ink on them. Kitchen designer Lisa Goldsmith, 45, came home to find her black-furred cat, Pepsi, covered in a bright red liquid. Pepsi spread the colour throughout her house and onto their eight month-old kitten Daisy. Residents claim business owner Mohammed Hussain, who has a food factory on the industrial estate, is to blame for the liquid, but he denies he is at fault. Mr Hussain said: 'There were building materials in our yard while we had work going on, but all that has gone now. 'Health and hygiene is a big priority for us as we are a food distribution business.' A Southend Council spokesman said they always investigated reports of environmental hazards. The children's TV show Bagpuss was created by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate in 1974 but remains one of Britain's best loved programme to this day. Only 13 episodes were ever made, which were broadcast from February 1974 to May that year, but they were repeated on television for the next 13 years. In 1999, Bagpuss topped a BBC poll for the UK's favourite children's TV programme. Each episode always started with Bagpuss asleep among lost toys displayed in a shop window owned by Emily, played by Firmin's daughter. Only 13 episodes were ever made of the show, voted the children's favourite TV show ever in 1999 . When Emily left the shop, Bagpuss - an 'old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams' - woke up and would tell a story centered on one of the broken items in the shop window. Various toys in the shop came to life, including Gabriel the toad, a rag doll called Madeleine and mice on the side of the 'mouse organ' (a small mechanical pipe organ that played rolls of music). The toys discussed what the new object was and then the mice, singing in high-pitched squeaky harmony to the tune of Sumer Is Icumen In, mended the broken object. The newly mended thing was then be put in the shop window, so that whoever had lost it would see it as they went past, and could come in and claim it. Then Bagpuss would start yawning again, and the show would end as he fell asleep. Beloved cat: Bagpuss starred in the children's TV show of the same name, which also featured squeaky mice . Bagpuss has now retired to the Rupert Bear Museum in Canterbury, part of the Museum of Canterbury, together with other characters from the show and Emily's shop window. Most of the stories and songs used in the series are based on folk songs and fairy tales from around the world. In 1987 the University of Kent at Canterbury awarded honorary degrees to Postgate and Firmin. In his speech, Postgate stated that the degree was really intended for Bagpuss, who was subsequently displayed in academic dress. In 1999 the series came first in a BBC poll selecting the nation's favourite children's show. It also came fourth in the 2001 Channel 4 poll The 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows.","Casper the cat was dyed pink like Bagpuss after accident with red ink .

"By . Brendan Carlin . The Muslim peer who quit the Cabinet last week has launched an extraordinary attack on David Cameron and the Conservative Party. In an outspoken onslaught against her fellow Tories, Sayeeda Warsi condemned the ‘public school’ allies around the Prime Minister.

Yesterday, she called on Mr Cameron to ‘recognise Palestine as a state’ and impose an arms embargo on Israel. But her plea was combined with a fierce attack on Chancellor George Osborne who last week claimed that her resignation was ‘unnecessary’. She said: ‘My actions would not have been necessary if he had done what he should have done, which is pick up the phone to people he is incredibly close to and say, “It’s unnecessary for you to meet your ends by taking out power stations, taking out homes, taking out schools and killing kids on beaches.” ’ A No 10 source said: ‘As the Prime Minister (right) made clear in his letter to Baroness Warsi (second left) last week, he valued her contribution as a Minister – and before that in opposition – and was disappointed by her decision to resign' (With Samantha Cameron, second right, and Fiona Hodgson, Conservative conference chairman .

"By . Stephanie Linning . Police are trying to trace a boy after a 14-year-old was held at knife-point by two thieves who demanded he give them his bottle of coke. The victim was drinking outside in Manor Square, in Solihull, at around 7pm on 6 July when he was approached by two youths demanding he give them his soft drink. The teenager initially refused, but handed over the bottle when the thieves produced a knife and threatened him. Suspect: The police have released CCTV images of the teenager they are looking to speak to in connection with the incident in Solihull, West Midlands. He is described as black, about 5ft 7ins tall and aged between 14 and 15 . A male teenager has already been . arrested, but officers want to speak to another person in connection with . what happened and have released CCTV pictures in a bid to trace him. A West Midlands Police spokesperson said that this type of crime was 'unusual' in Solihull, which has one of the lowest crime rates in the West Midlands. She said: 'Solihull is quite an affluent area, crime is really low there so this incident is unusual'. There were only 88 recorded incidents of robbery recorded in Solihull over the last year. Lorey Burt, MP for Solihull said that she was shocked to hear about the attack. She said: 'My first thoughts are with the young man who obviously had a very frightening experience. 'As . a former prison officer my message to the youths who did this is they . should think very carefully before going down a path of crime. 'Solihull . is usually a pretty safe place and I feel lucky to live here. Crime is . falling across the West Midlands but many people feel less safe than . ever. Targeted: The 14-year-old boy was drinking a bottle of coke on the street in Manor Square, Solihull, pictured, when the two youths approached him. A police spokesperson described the area as 'affluent' 'We need to work on reassuring the public and cutting police . response times. 'I will be discussing this further with local . barrister Ayoub Khan, who is campaigning to be the next Police and Crime . Commissioner for the West Midlands.' Police hope that by releasing the images they will be able to find the second youth they want to speak to in connection with the incident and have urged anyone who recognises the suspect to come forward. Detective constable Tom Finch said: 'This was a potentially nasty incident involving a knife which left the young victim very shaken. The person shown in the CCTV images is described as black, about 5ft 7ins tall, and aged between 14 and 15. Detective constable Finch continued: 'It is vital that we speak to this person as soon as possible - if you know him, please do the right thing and call us with the information on 101.'

"By . Richard Spillett . Police wrongly categorised reports of Andrew Kemp's violence towards his girlfriend, Leighann Wightmann, who he went to kill in a knife attack . Police failed to act on reports that a convicted rapist had attacked his girlfriend, who he then went to kill, a damning report has found. Andrew Kemp, 48, was jailed for life for murdering Leighann Wightman in 2012 after he stabbed her eight times in a vicious attack. But a review of the case was ordered after it emerged at his trial that Kemp was a convicted rapist who had also been prosecuted over the murder of a woman in Scotland. A report by South Nottinghamshire Community Safety Partnership has now found that Ms Wightman had reported Kemp's violence in 2008. It criticised police and seven other agencies, including a local NHS Trust, for failing to share information that could have saved the 24-year-old's life. Fuelled by drink and jealous rage, Kemp burst into Ms Wightman's home in Netherfield, near Nottingham in 2011, amid claims she had sent flirty texts to a friend. CCTV revealed he was in the house for 14 minutes after which she was found with 27 knife injuries. Kemp had left her to die in a bedroom. It later emerged that has also been accused of battering to death Scottish grandmother Nora Smith and setting fire to her home in 1993. Under Scottish law, a not proven verdict was given in the case and police never reopened the inquiry. But despite his record, when Ms Wightman reported Kemp's violence in 2008, police left her alone with her soon-to-be killer. Making 44 recommendations for future treatment, the new report demanded that domestic abuse cases be given more attention in future. The report read: 'The (initial) incident was incorrectly graded and not ""tagged"" as domestic abuse: urgent grading would have been appropriate in this case. 'Attempts should have been made to contact Victim A [Ms Wightman] directly to check on her welfare when the address was visited in the early hours of that morning and there is no reference as to whether Victim A may have required medical attention.' Ms Wightman reported Kemp's violence to police in 2008 but authorities underestimated the risk he posed . It added: 'Officers [must be] reminded that when attending a domestic incident involving cross allegations they should fully investigate each allegation, examine whether justifiable force has been used in self-defence and evaluate each party's complaint separately.' Nottinghamshire Health Care NHS Trust was offered seven points of advice, which include ensuring that domestic abuse training is mandatory for all staff. The review panel also said there is a need for better sharing of information between agencies and ensuring that interventions are made. Following the report's publication, Anthony May, Nottinghamshire County Council's corporate director for children, families and cultural services, said: 'We fully accept the report's findings and have already implemented the recommendations.' Superintendent Helen Chamberlain, head of public protection for the police, said of the recommendations: 'The force has already implemented and resolved all but one, and the final one [relating to a database review] is currently undergoing development.'

The couple's visit to Legoland this week was part of a 'family trip' to Windsor, Berkshire, before the ex-Manchester United player settles down for the Premier League season. Wes joined the Manchester United youth team in 1996, before becoming a regular first team player in the 1998-99 season, during which he was part of the club's treble-winning side. From 2000 to 2008, he won numerous honours, including four Premier League titles, an FA Cup, a League Cup and another Champions League. He earned his first England cap in 1999, before being selected to play at the 2002 World Cup.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . For most owners, the thought of losing their beloved pet is unimaginable. But for some, such a crisis appears to evoke creativity, humour and even a desperation to lose them for good. These hilarious photos show missing pet signs that have been put up by owners and members of the public across the world. Have you seen me?

"By . Martin Beckford . Millions of holidaymakers crossing the English Channel face long delays under ‘unworkable’ new immigration laws, travel chiefs warned yesterday. Home Secretary Theresa May wants ferry and rail firms to carry out stringent exit checks to improve border security and identify illegal immigrants. Staff at firms including Eurostar, Eurotunnel and P&O face taking on the role of border guards by scanning all passports and checking that photographs match the passengers before they board. Scroll down for video . Stringent checks: Theresa May is urging ferry and rail ports to step up security and passport checks . They say it could take tourists up to six times as long to check in, putting them at risk of missing their trains or boats. The travel industry says the  rules – some of which were only made law last week – may even be illegal under European Union free movement laws. The Government is committed to introducing 100 per cent exit checks by April 2015, but critics claim it is to make the Coalition look tough on immigration. It follows the collapse of a £500 million scheme called  e-Borders that was meant to put details of all passengers on a database before they travel. Under fire: Critics claim May's move could dramatically increase waiting times at ports like the Eurostar . Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe claimed the new rules had been ‘poorly thought out’. Guy Platten of the UK Chamber of Shipping called for ‘a regime that intercepts illegals without obstructing everyone else’. Maritime industry leaders will meet Mrs May tomorrow. The Home Office said: ‘We are working closely with carriers and rail, maritime and air port operators.’","Theresa May wants ferry and rail firms to carry out stringent exit checks .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Ministers have asked to hold controversial court cases behind closed doors five times in the past year – and been given permission for at least three. The cases involve a terror suspect suing the Government over alleged torture, Iranian shipping officials suspected of transporting nuclear material, and an IRA mole suing MI5. Powers for judges to allow  evidence to be heard in private, in civil cases involving national security, were pushed through Parliament last year despite strong opposition. The Strand facade of the Royal Courts of Justice in London: Five controversial lawsuits will be heard in secret . In the first report on how the power had been used, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling revealed ministers had made five applications for the ‘closed material procedure’ in the year to June 24. The report said two applications had been granted, but it is known that a third was also allowed at the start of this month. The other two are yet to be decided. A government spokesman said the figures showed the power created under the Justice and Security Act 2013 had been used ‘sparingly’. But campaigners say the Government is simply trying to avoid embarrassment after high-profile cases such as the Guantanamo detainees who sought damages for alleged torture. In one case, Home Secretary Theresa May won a top judge’s permission to use secret court hearings to defend a damages claim brought by IRA mole  Martin McGartland, a former Special Branch officer. He was suing MI5 for breach of contract and negligence in the way he was treated following a shooting by the IRA which left him unable to work. He claims the security services failed to provide care for post-traumatic stress disorder and access to disability benefits. Mr Justice  Mitting said ‘sensitive material’ relating to the protection and the training of security service ‘handlers’ arose in the case which could not be heard in public. The Mail has campaigned against secret courts . The Government was also granted secret hearings in a case involving members of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. They are seeking damages from the Foreign Office for loss of earnings after their assets were frozen for their alleged involvement in ‘the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems’. Donald Campbell, of the legal charity Reprieve, said: ‘The Government’s case for their expansion of secret courts is just as misleading as it always was. ‘The reality is that there were already measures in place to allow national security-sensitive material to be dealt with safely. ‘The closed material procedure – which allows the Government to use evidence against you which you cannot even see – was always more about avoiding state embarrassment than ensuring justice is done.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘The Government believes that closed material procedures are the right way to enable civil cases involving national security material which the courts recognise is too sensitive to disclose. ‘Previously these cases had been unable to proceed – meaning no final judgment from a court, none of the questions posed by the claimant answered, and the Government forced to spend taxpayers’ money to settle claims without being able to put across their case.’ The Mail has long campaigned to expose the risk to democracy and openness from secret courts – including closed family courts, super-injunctions and civil cases involving national security.","Powers for civil cases to be heard in private were pushed through last year .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A young girl who was raped by two boys she was playing Xbox with was subjected to a tirade on online abuse accusing her of 'asking for it' and 'lying' about the assaults. The girl, from Chepstow, south Wales, was just ten when she was raped by boys aged 12 and 13 as they played the Minecraft computer game together. The boys, who are too young to be named, were sentenced at Newport Crown Court last month, and the girl's 35-year-old mother hoped to rebuild her daughter's shattered life. Online abuse: After two boys were sentenced for raping a ten-year-old, she was accused of 'asking for it' But soon after the sentencing - the boys avoided jail because of their age - a family friend of one of the boys wrote on Facebook that the young victim 'asked for it'. A stream of abuse then followed, with one troller accusing the girl of crying rape when she had consented, and another saying it was her fault. The girl's mother went to police but they told her they weren't able to help, and told her to talk to Facebook, who told her the comments didn't breach their 'community standards'. The Facebook page had nearly 200 comments on it by the time the girl's mother contacted the person who set it up and persuaded them to take it down. Last year she had had to cope with similar harassment after the mother of one of the boys posted the victim's name and address on Facebook.  She later took it down after police intervened. Today the girl's mother spoke of the nightmare she and her daughter have lived through since the boys were arrested over the rape last August. She told the Sun: 'I thought that after the guilty verdict in court we would get our lives back, but it has got worse. 'It is heart-breaking for my daughter - she is a prisoner here.' Judge Ian Murphy, left, didn't send the boys to jail but gave them curfews and tags instead - Monmouth MP David Davies, right, has called the sentences 'pathetic' and asked the Attorney General to review them . Last month, the boys, who are both now 14 and were found guilty of rape after denying the offence, were given tags for three months and put under a curfew. They were also given rehabilitation orders with intense supervision. Judge Ian Murphy told them: 'This is a very serious offence. Had you been adults you would have been looking at a lengthy custodial sentence.' Today the victims' mother criticised the boys' sentences as 'pathetic', a cause local Conservative MP David Davies has taken up. He has written to the Attorney General asking for the boys' sentences to be reconsidered. 'I'm absolutely appalled at the way this girl has been treated both in her community and by the judicial system,' Mr Davies said. And he expressed his disgust at what he called the 'sickening campaign of persecution' the girl and her family had suffered. A spokesman for Gwent Police said that the online comments about the girl were not criminal so they had no grounds to take action. They said: 'We endeavour to give victims of crime and their families all the support they need to live their lives safely and securely. 'In this case we were made aware of some comments which appeared on a Facebook page. Officers visited the home of the victim and viewed the comments, which whilst distasteful, were not criminal in nature. 'Officers had no grounds to take formal action and in good faith suggested the victim take the matter up directly with Facebook. 'We continue to support the family, and an officer has been dedicated to discuss and deal with any concerns they may.' A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service told MailOnline: 'Our case was clear that this was rape and the jury convicted for rape.' A Facebook spokesman admitted the posts should have been taken down as implying a minor can consent to or ask for sex did breach their standards. They said: 'We encourage people to report things that they find offensive so we can investigate and remove if it breaks our rules. 'Unfortunately we don’t always get it right and on this occasion we should have removed the group. We are sorry for any upset or distress this may have caused.'","Girl was playing Minecraft on Xbox when the boys, then 12 and 13, raped her .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 02:35 EST, 11 July 2011 . Tenderness in a long-term relationship is more important to middle-aged men than it is to women, according to a study. Men in a committed relationship are also more likely to report being happy, while women are more likely to say they are satisfied with their sex lives, surprised researchers said. For men, relationship happiness was more likely if the man reported being in good health and if it was important to him that his partner experienced orgasm. Together forever: Cuddling in a long-term relationship is more important to middle-aged men than it is to women, according to a study . Surprisingly, frequent kissing or cuddling also predicted happiness in the relationship for men, but not for women. More than 1,000 couples who had been together an average 25 years were questioned about their private lives by scientists from the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University. The couples came from the U.S., Brazil, Germany, Japan and Spain. Research to understand the place of sexuality in human lives rarely involves intact couples in ongoing relationships. Lead researcher Julia Heiman said: 'It's important to note that though divorce rates are high in the U.S., couples tend to stay married - more than 50 per cent of U.S. couples remain in their first marriage, and that number goes up to 90 per cent in Spain. 'We know from other research that being in a long-term relationship has some value to health. Perhaps we can learn more about what makes relationships both sustainable and happy.' Participants in the study were 40- to 70-year-old men and their female partners, either married or living together for a minimum of one year. The study included around 200 couples from each country. The men and women answered gender-specific questionnaires and were assured that their responses would not be shared with their partner. Dr Heiman said: 'This study on heterosexual couples provides a basis for future research on sex and gender, such as how same-sex couples may or may not show similarities and differences in relationship and sexual satisfaction.' Both men and women reported more happiness the longer they had been together, and if they themselves scored higher on several sexual functioning questionnaires. Across all five nationalities, for both men and women, the Japanese were significantly happier with their relationships than Americans, and Brazilians and Spanish reported less relationship happiness than Americans. Men and women both were likely to report sexual satisfaction if they also reported frequent kissing and cuddling, sexual caressing by the partner, higher sexual functioning, and if they had sex more frequently. On the other hand, for men, having had more sex partners in their lifetime was a predictor of less sexual satisfaction. Men did report more relationship happiness in later years, whereas for women, their sexual satisfaction increased over time. Women who had been with their partner for less than 15 years were less likely to report sexual satisfaction, but after 15 years, the percentage went up significantly. 'Possibly, women become more satisfied over time because their expectations change, or life changes with the children grown,' Dr Heiman said. 'On the other hand, those who weren't so happy sexually might not be married so long.' Compared with the U.S. men, Japanese men reported they were 2.61 times more sexual satisfied in their relationships. For women, Japanese and Brazilian women were more likely to report being satisfied sexually than Americans. Dr Heiman said: 'We recognise that relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction may not be the same thing for all couples, and in all cultures. 'Our next step is to understand how one person's health, physical affection and sexual experiences relate to the relationship happiness or sexual satisfaction of his or her partner. 'So we hope for more couple-centred than individual-centred understanding on relationship functioning and satisfaction.' The study is published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior.","Women in a committed relationship more likely to be sexually satisfied, Kinsey Institute study says ."
"By . Sanchez Manning . The number of Romanian immigrants sleeping rough in some of the wealthiest areas of the capital has trebled since EU restrictions on movement were lifted in January. The rise in vagrants is reported to have sparked a spate of aggressive begging, pickpocketing and prostitution, which is blighting exclusive London addresses such as Park Lane. Revelations about the influx come after politicians dismissed predictions that there would be a fresh wave of immigration when Bulgarians and Romanians were given unrestricted rights to work in the UK on January 1. Yet now the problem has become so acute that Westminster Council is set to hold high-level talks with Home Office officials next week. Homeless immigrants seen sleeping rough outside shops in Park Lane last week . Bands of up to 20 Romanian beggars were witnessed last week setting up camps to bed down overnight around Marble Arch and Hyde Park. Those living or working nearby said the Eastern European gangs have been washing in fountains, dumping rubbish, urinating and even defecating in public. Aaron Devaney, a sightseeing tour sales agent based in Marble Arch, said: ‘They rob, they steal, they make a mockery of the country and then the police come and give them free flights home. I know what they’re up to because I see them every day. They sleep around the edges of the grass and shower in the fountains.’ Mark Field, Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster, last night called for the Government to take urgent action. He said: ‘Romanians are entitled to come to this country, and many I know have come to take up employment and make a contribution. What is unacceptable is the vast increase in the number sleeping rough on the streets of our capital and there must be urgent action to ensure they are sent back to Romania.’ Those living around Marble Arch and Hyde Park said they have seen Eastern European gangs washing in fountains, dumping rubbish, urinating and even defecating in public during the last week . Last month, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander called warnings of a rise in Eastern European migration ‘inflammatory rhetoric’ and ‘scaremongering’. His comments came in response to official figures showing the number of Bulgarians and Romanians working in the UK had fallen by 4,000 in the three months since employment restrictions were lifted. However, Scott Blinder, from Oxford’s Migration Observatory, said those figures had come too early to ‘tell us anything apart from what had happened in a very short period’. He added that it was ‘certainly possible there will be an increase’ in numbers of Bulgarian and Romanian migrants when further figures are released later this year. A pedestrian walks past Romanian's sleeping rough in Park Lane in December last year . Conservative MP Mark Reckless,  a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘The previous figures were wrongly seized upon to show no influx of Romanians and Bulgarians. ‘They were no basis for concluding that numbers will be low, so it is  perhaps no surprise to see these real figures from Westminster showing Romanian immigration remaining a very serious concern.’ Westminster Council’s report shows that the number of Romanian rough sleepers in Central London has risen from 20 in January to 59 last month. The local authority has been working with the UK Border Agency to use new powers to crack down on homeless groups. Under legislation introduced at the beginning of this year they can deport EU nationals sleeping rough and bar them from re-entry for 12 months if they cannot prove ‘they have a proper reason to be here, such as a job’. Meanwhile, the Home Office has been footing the bill for flights to return offending Romanians to their own country. But Westminster’s report states that in spite of these efforts ‘we continue to see an increasing number of Romanian nationals on the street’. It continues: ‘Despite this excellent partnership work, there [were]... 91 new non-UK rough sleepers recorded as bedded down on the streets of Westminster in May, the largest nationality were Romanian with 59 individuals.’ Council leader Philippa Roe said the authority wanted to take more stringent actions, but were limited by EU rules. She said: ‘We would like to crack down on it, but I’m just not sure what more we can do than we’ve already done... with the Border Agency because of EU regulations. Until something is done about free movement there is a limit to what we can legally do.’ Figures from Britain’s biggest police force show that almost 2,000 Romanians were arrested in the first three months after immigration restrictions were relaxed.The Metropolitan Police said 1,906 Romanians were held in London between January 1 and March 31, along with 220 Bulgarians.These led to 1,069 charges against Romanians and 100 against Bulgarians, from murder to sex offences and shoplifting.By contrast, in the first three  months of 2013 there were 852 charges against Romanians and  76 against Bulgarians.It means there has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of charges against Romanians this year.","More than 1,000 charges laid for crimes ranging from murder to shoplifting .

"By . Sam Greenhill . Buying two houses and knocking them through has long been a simple way to acquire a bigger home. But one tycoon is taking the concept a little further after purchasing seven houses in a row facing Regent’s Park in London. Marcus Cooper plans to knock down a few walls in the Grade I listed Regency houses to combine them into a single stuccoed ‘super-mansion’. The resulting home will be more akin to a palace, and indeed will claim the title of London's largest residence after Buckingham Palace. With an estimated £200million asking price, it will be one of the most expensive properties in Britain. It will have 35 bathrooms alone, making it most unlikely there will ever be arguments about vain teenagers hogging the bathroom. The seven-storey pad will have 15 bedrooms including a sumptuous master suite complete with an enormous dressing room and spacious 'his and hers' bathrooms. In a row: The seven Regency houses - including Numbers 1 and 2 Chester Gate (pictured) and Numbers 6 to 10 Cambridge Terrace - are Grade I listed and were designed by John Nash - the architect of Buckingham Palace . On the top floor of the house is the pièce de résistance - a lush private roof garden, completely invisible from street level. It will feature a giant sliding glass roof to allow sunbathing in hot weather, and keep out the rain during the rest of the year. The 'hanging gardens of Camden' will be 40ft long, bigger than most ground-level gardens in the capital. Then there is 472-acre Regent's Park itself, literally a stone's throw away. As if all this were not enough, the property is also going to be extended - underground. With land in Central London like gold . dust, the subterranean extension will create a leisure complex with a . swimming pool, jacuzzi, pool bar and cinema. Also involved: The resulting home - which includes Numbers 6 to 10 Cambridge Terrace (pictured) will be more akin to a palace, and indeed will claim the title of London's largest residence after Buckingham Palace . The property will have 50,000 sq ft of living space. And, in the manner of a grand stately home, it will boast a grand spiral staircase, a banqueting room, a billiards room, a library, children's rooms and a smoking room. The seven Regency houses - Numbers 6 to 10 Cambridge Terrace and Numbers 1 and 2 Chester Gate - are Grade I listed and were designed by John Nash - the architect of Buckingham Palace. Developer: Marcus Cooper, 46, has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital's finest homes . In recent years, they have been used as cramped office space, and the local authority has granted planning permission to restore them to residential use. Camden Council rejected objections from local conservationists who wanted the houses to be several individual homes rather than a single dwelling, but English Heritage has backed the project. Property mogul Marcus Cooper paid £23.7million in 2007 to buy the seven houses from the Crown Estate. Developer Mr Cooper, 46, has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital's finest homes. In April, he sold three terraces nearby for £120million to the Qatari royal family. This latest project is the biggest so far, and will take nearly three years to complete. Experts expect the vast home to be purchased by an oligarch from Russia or a Middle Eastern royal family. If it is sold for £200million, that is 1,229 times more expensive than the UK average house price of £162,606. At that asking price, the buyer will face a £14million bill for stamp duty. Despite the shaky economic recovery, 2012 was a record year for sales in London worth more than £5million, according to research by estate agent Savills. Another Nash property, 18 Carlton House Terrace, was recently put on the market for £250million, making it the UK's most expensive home if it reaches its asking price.","Marcus Cooper, 46, purchases houses all in a row facing park in London .

"By . Martin Beckford . It's the sort of picture-postcard haven of rural tranquillity seen in TV’s Midsomer Murders – and indeed it has even featured in the series. But perhaps the pace of modern life is finally catching up with the sleepy Watlington, as new figures reveal it is home to the worst drivers in England. One in seven motorists in the tiny Oxfordshire market town have points on their licence – twice the national average. Scroll down for video . Mind the trap: Watlington has been revealed as the home of the worst drivers in England . 'Sneaky': But motorists in the town say they have been wronged by overly aggressive officers . But residents of the town - population 2,000 - are blaming local police for the unwelcome statistic. They say ‘sneaky’ officers hide behind walls and hedges with a mobile speed camera to catch them going just over the limit as they head out of the town’s narrow, congested streets. Steve Drake of car repair garage Merlin Motors said: ‘They are extremely sneaky about it. The police hide on the corner so people can’t see them when they come round the bend. If you do things like that you’re going to catch people, and we do get a lot of it.’ DVLA figures analysed by The Mail on Sunday show that as of March this year, 493 of the 3,603 motorists in the OX49 postcode, which includes Watlington, had penalty points on their driving licences. This proportion – 13.68 per cent – is more than double the national average of 6.47 per cent. It is thought that most of Watlington’s speeding drivers are caught going over the 30mph limit by a Thames Valley Police van parked in a lay-by on the B-road leading out of the town towards the M40. Resident Jan Faulkner said: ‘The speed camera van is here almost weekly so people should have learned by now. I got caught once and I know they’re here.’ Ian Hill, chairman of the parish council, said: ‘Our problem is congestion. If people can speed they’re doing well.’ But vet’s receptionist Sarah Rigg said: ‘People just tear through like it’s a race track. It’s dangerous.’ That’s a view echoed by Oscar- winning actor Jeremy Irons, who became so concerned about lorries using his home town as a rat run between the M40 and M4 motorways that last year he became the patron of an action group. Life in the fast lane: Sleepy Watlington is home to scores of speeders . Other places where there are above-average numbers of motorists with licence endorsements are parts of Worcester, Uxbridge, Slough and Poole. Across the UK as a whole, far more drivers in Glasgow have picked up penalty points than anywhere else, with experts again putting it down to enthusiastic enforcement. Simon Best, chief executive of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘While these statistics make interesting reading, in reality it doesn’t truly reflect the behaviour of drivers in those areas. It is more a reflection of police activity.’ DVLA figures also reveal that men aged 42 to 50 are more likely to have speeding points than drivers of any other age, while men tend to have more points than women. Edmund King, president of the AA, said: ‘Men aged 42 to 50 are more likely to have points than younger drivers as they have had more time on the road to accumulate points and do higher mileages. ‘Generally we find that men tend to take more chances on the road than women and do more miles.’ Although most drivers lose their licences after accumulating 12 points in a three-year period, judges can allow them to drive if their livelihoods depend on it – and 2,304 currently have 13 or more points. One man from Liverpool has 45 points on his licence, which he got for speeding and failing to disclose who was behind the wheel; a Warrington driver has 36 points for driving without insurance; while a woman from Lincoln has 34.","New figures revealed Watlington, Oxfordshire is hotbed of bad driving .

The gunslingers are long gone and tumbleweeds have taken over at this abandoned American Wild West theme park, which hasn't seen a cowboy, not even one in fancy dress, for years. The saloon bar doors last swung open in 2009, since when the Yellow Rose Hotel, the County Jail, and the lawyer's office, along with the rest of the Spirit Of The West park’s buildings, have been left untouched. Eerie photographs showing long-gone visitors dressed in cowboy costumes are still pinned to the wooden walls, while dust gathers on the bottles of bourbon still standing on bar-room tables at the tourist attraction at Winnard's Perch, near St Columb Major in Cornwall. A photographer, who uses the name Urbex-SW and took these pictures, said: 'What was once a happy, bustling and buzzing location has been left to ruin. 'I’ve seen some amazing places, but this was something so different from all the rest. 'What was most interesting was the pictures of the families who visited the park when it was open as they capture the happiness and excitement of the children.' Scroll down for video .

As well as the NHS breast surgery, which increased her bust from a 32A to 36DD, Miss Cunningham has undergone Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Just been told all 4 tickets have sold out in 14 minutes!' Earlier this year, she sparked further outrage after publicly considering aborting the son she is due to give birth to because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. Just weeks later, she claimed she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. Leeds City Council eventually decided to axe the service, prompting Miss Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’ Shocked: However, Twitter users were less than impressed with the wannabe model's money-making scheme .

Three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two went for £5,000 each. Miss Cunningham, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000 prostitute, said all tickets include travel and accommodation, while the more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and take photos. She formed her latest Skype plan after her hopes selling DVDs of the birth of her son through a chain of pound shops fell through. It comes just days after Miss Cunningham declared she was 'genuinely gutted' to discover she was expecting a third boy, not the little girl she had hoped for. The wannabe model, who already has two boys, aged six and three, said she smoked a whole packed of cigarettes and drowned her sorrows with a glass of wine after finding out her baby's sex. She told the Mirror: 'The evening I found out the sex of the baby was when I lit up my first cigarette. 'I knew it could harm my child but it didn't stop me.  Deep down I know I wouldn't be smoking or drinking if I knew I was having a girl.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A North Carolina Republican candidate campaigning against same-sex marriage has been outed as a former drag queen performer known as 'Miss Mona Sinclair'. Steve Wiles, a conservative state Senate candidate, donned a wig and fake lashes for eight years at the now defunct gay-friendly lounge Club Odyssey, where he directed and emceed a weekly drag show. The club's former owner Randy Duggins told Winston-Salem Journal he broke his silence because he wants voters to know that Wiles is, he believes, a 'hypocrite' and 'liar'. Wiles, 34, initially denied the bombshell allegations, but came out yesterday admitting his past. 'For me, from a religious standpoint, just for my life, for me, it just was not something that I wanted to continue,' the fledgling politician told Business Insider about being a drag queen. 'Of course it was an embarrassment, but you know, you move on. You live life, and you change, and you make yourself what you want yourself to be. And that's where I am now.' Revelation: Outspoken gay marriage opponent Steve Wiles, 34 (pictured) has been outed as having worked as a drag queen performer known as 'Miss Mona Sinclair' Wiles, who doesn't consider himself 'anti-gay', supports a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in North Carolina. He considers marriage a religious institution, which he argues makes gay marriage un-Christian. The real estate agent is competing against two other GOP candidates in a competitive primary scheduled for Tuesday, with observers noting he is up against well-connected politicos. Wiles has not indicated whether he believes news of his past will hurt his chances, but said he has no intention of quitting. Today, he responded to his critics in a . long post on Facebook (see below) in which he claimed he 'is for' all . Americans, regardless of their sexuality, and believes 'state control of . the institution of marriage is unconstitutional'. Wiles, who refuses to comment on his own sexuality, said that he doesn't believe being against same-sex marriage is the same thing as being anti-gay. 'I don't really understand how you can separate the fact that marriage is a religious institution,' Wiles told Business Insider. However to his former boss Randy Duggins, Wiles' refusal to acknowledge his former days as a female impersonator while opposing marriage equality is a sign of hypocrisy. Reaction: Steve Wiles today posted a response to his critics on his Facebook page, saying that he makes mistakes but tries to live a life that reflects his beliefs . Duggins told Winston-Salem Journal that Wiles worked at the gay club from 2002 to 2010. 'I . recognized his picture when I was looking in the paper. That’s . definitely him. He has aged some, but that’s him,' Duggins said. 'I have . no ax to grind against him. I just think he's a liar.' The Winston Salem-Journal article reported Wiles emceed a show at Club Odyssey around '2001 and 2002'. He said, prior to that, Wiles was a regular visitor in the 1990s. According to the Journal, Wiles was also listed on the 'Miss Gay America' site as a 'former promoter of Miss Gay Eastern States America and a city preliminary promoter for Miss Gay North Carolina America'. The webpage also said that Wiles was suspended for 'conduct unbecoming to a promoter of the Miss Gay America pageant system'. Wiles maintains that the role was 'just something I didn't want to continue'. While he now views his past as a drag queen as 'an embarrassment' and at odds with his Christian beliefs, he said there were positive things he took away from the experience. 'I learned a lot of lessons, some of them, well most of them, the hard way,' Wiles said. Wiles works as a real estate agent at Coldwell Banker Triad, Realtors, in Belews Creek, North Carolina. Denial: Republican Senate hopeful Steve Wiles (pictured left and right) initially denied reports he once worked as a drag queen . Scene: Political hopeful Steve Wiles admitted he used to perform as drag queen 'Miss Mona Sinclair' at the now defunct gay-friendly bar Club Odyssey in Winston, North Carolina (pictured in August 2012) Gay Star News reported that, following the publication of the Journal article, Wiles posted a message to Facebook which was later removed: . 'I'm sure many of you saw my glowing recommendation in the Winston Salem Journal - I'd like to apologize to everyone because, unlike the currently appointed NC Senator in District 31, I made mistakes,' he allegedly wrote. 'My job was embarrassing - I had to have a job! Nobody died, leaving me a millionaire capable of living in North Carolina's most expensive neighborhood. One thing I will say, I learned from my mistakes... 'I understand the gay community does not share my support for the Marriage Amendment - I RESPECT THAT and am very happy to discuss my views with any of my friends in the Democrat party and gay community. Meanwhile, I regret the fact that something so trivial would cloud an otherwise decent campaign....What more could be expected though?

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Fernando, the player Manchester City have bought to irritate opponents in the depths of their midfield, breaks into a smile when he considers his nickname ‘The Octopus’. For fans at his former club Porto it appeared he had eight legs, such was the frequency he flicked the ball away from advancing attackers. That the match which first saw the £12million Brazilian called as such came against Manchester United should instantly warm the hearts of those on the blue half. In April 2009 Fernando provided the sting to Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney as United were held to a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in the Champions League. Tenacious: Fernando, then of Porto, keeps a close eye on Wayne Rooney during a Champions League game . Going nowhere: The Brazilian's strong performance against United led to his nickname 'The Octopus' Body on the line: The 27-year-old dives in front of a Cristiano Ronaldo during the 2-2 draw at Old Trafford . ‘It was during that game that the Porto fans nicknamed me The Octopus,’ says Fernando through a translator. ‘At the time Manchester United had a very strong team. They had Cristiano Ronaldo and Rooney was playing really well. ‘I played really well and stole quite a lot of balls and that’s when the Porto fans started calling me The Octopus. It was as if I had a lot of legs!’ It can be argued that legs in the defensive third of the pitch is what Manuel Pellegrini’s midfield lacked at times last season. Yaya Toure would stride forward to devastating effect without particular concern to tracking back, while Fernandinho is a box-to-box player keen to attack. Fernando will sit deep and provide steel, especially when the big games roll around and solidity is imperative. ‘I have a very strong defensive game and that is going to help us a lot because teams will take advantage of City being so attacking, on the counter-attack. I’m going to add very good value in that sense. Come here! Fernando stops Philippe Coutinho in his tracks during the Guinness International Champions Cup . Adding bite to City's midfield: Fernando hopes to provide a platform for the likes of Yaya Toure to thrive from . ‘There are some great players here. But every day that goes on I have to work hard in order to get my spot. I know my strengths and will work hard to make sure I’m first choice.’ Fernando, 27, has been overlooked by his country ever since he was suspended for a year after pushing over a referee during an Under-20 match against Chile, who featured a young Alexis Sanchez. He has calmed since then but there are no fears the Premier League might prove too tough. He holds a Portuguese passport having moved to Porto in 2007 and this year he tried to play for his adopted home only for FIFA to rule a match he played at youth level counted as competitive, preventing a switch of allegiances. Close control: He keeps the ball away from Atletico Madrid youngster Oliver Torres in 2013 . Putting his boot in: Enzo Perez of Benfica feels the force of Fernando during a Portuguese league match . Fernando watched Brazil’s humbling 7-1 defeat to Germany at the World Cup – a match in which Fernandinho was replaced at halftime – and says ‘naturally’ when asked if he could have reinforced the team. ‘There were many errors,’ he adds. ‘But obviously I didn’t have the opportunity to play so we will never know. No Brazilian expected that the score would be like that. That’s something that’s going to be marked in the history of Brazilian football.’ Of the incident in January 2007 which saw him branded a black sheep in Brazil he says: ‘I was very young at the time and it was a hot-headed moment. I was playing really well and it was something that really marked my career. Obviously that has prevented me from going further in the Brazilian team. I don’ t think that’s the only reason but I think that had a factor. ‘It was a moment I learned a lot from. It put me in good stead for these days. Now I always try to be calm and tranquil on the pitch and not speak back to the referee.’ Helping out: Fernando smiles at a 'City in the Community' event held at the club's Carrington training ground . Fernando will compete with Fernandinho for a place, but they might also play together, representing something of a commentator’s nightmare. They even look alike. Their team-mates have already devised a way to differentiate. ‘I think they are calling Fernandinho “Fay” and calling me “Nando”,’ he says with a smile. Fernando was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield Media Day at Carrington, where he joined in to helped the Club’s Community Coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs in a free soccer school.","The Brazilian moved to the Etihad from Porto for £12m earlier this summer .

Hopes of claiming only a third All Blacks scalp on Kiwi soil were dashed by a 3-0 series whitewash that concluded with a harrowing 36-13 rout in the final Test. It was an undeniable setback despite the fixture congestion that complicated team selection and England now have 12 months left to develop into a team capable of winning the World Cup. Humbled: England's players looked dejected after their 3-0 series defeat by the All Blacks . New Zealand, their main rivals for the Webb Ellis trophy, are the first visitors to Twickenham this autumn and Care is convinced they can be caught before the tournament opens in September 2015. ‘Results-wise the tour wasn't successful. We lost three out of three games and that's not good enough,’ the Harlequins scrum-half said. 'But we play them again in the autumn and we're on the right track. 'They're where we're aiming to get to and we have 12 games before the World Cup in which to get better. 'The younger lads are getting more experienced and this is an incredibly exciting time for us.

I got it in my second training session of the tour. I was battling every day to try and get it right,' he said. 'I ran across to do a grubber kick to Jonny May - a kick I'd normally do a hundred times - and completely missed the ball, tripped over and landed funnily on my shoulder.

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . Bournemouth have curbed their spending this summer, but manager Eddie Howe is safe in the knowledge that the club’s board will back him to the hilt should he want to splash the cash. The Cherries, who travel to Huddersfield on Saturday, surprised many by finishing 10th in the Championship last season after spending £2.5million on South African striker Tokelo Rantie among others. And while that initial financial outlay has subsided somewhat — a decision the manager insists was made by himself rather than those above — they are confident of mixing it around the play-offs. Content: Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe is pleased with the club's dealings this summer . ‘We’ve got a stronger squad and we’re in a better place this time than last year,’ he said. Howe did lose top scorer Lewis Grabban to Norwich City for £3m this summer, but wisely reinvested some of that fee on striker Callum Wilson from Coventry. Signing the 22-year-old typifies his management in that Bournemouth are a club who look to nurture. ‘We believe we have a very strong squad at a good age,’ Howe added. ‘It’s difficult to find better players than we have with the budget constraints we’re under. If you can’t find an improvement, why bother bringing anyone in? You’re better developing the players rather than bringing new people in. That’s always been my methodology.’ Transfer: Callum Wilson, above, joined the club from Coventry after Callum Wilson was sold to Norwich for £3m . It’s certainly astute given that Bournemouth have twice collapsed into insolvency — in 1997 and 2008 —before owner Maxim Demin overhauled the club and funded a tilt at only their second ever spell at Championship level. Howe puts the rise down to strong communication between boss and board, intimating that it is now time to kick on further. Asked if money would be made available in January should the club be in a position to reach the top six, Howe said: ‘When the time comes that we feel we need to go to them then I’m sure they’ll back us. ‘They’ve never turned me down through a disagreement on a recruitment purchase.’","Cherries spent £2.5million on South African striker Tokelo Rantie last year .

"By . Ray Massey . The taxman is seeking official permission to break the speed limit like the emergency services under a new initiative launched by ministers. And so is 007. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) wants to join the police, fire, and ambulance and ‘life-saving’  999 crews who have a special exemption from obeying the speed limit. Breaking the limit: HM Revenue and Customs are among the organisations calling for an exemption on speed limits . Life savers: At present only the emergency services are afforded the right to break the speed limit . The proposals, now out for consultation, examine the possibility of extending speed limit exemptions to other services apart from police, fire and ambulance. These would include those carrying organs for transplant, bomb disposal units, the blood transfusion service, mountain and mine rescue, radiation emergencies, coastguard and RNLI lifeboat launching services. But nestling in the small print of a 90 page consultation document published by the Department for Transport – and conspicuous by its absence in an accompanying press release -  the report notes: ‘HM Revenue and Customs are seeking exemptions from speed limits for its covert surveillance vehicles.’ It adds: ‘Customs surveillance operations mirror the activities of the police service and they have extensive arrest and investigatory powers.’ Legalising: Although James Bond, seen her in an Aston Martin, may be used to high speed car chases the Security Services are only just asking to be exempt from speed restrictions . The AA raised an eyebrow at the inclusion of the taxman seeking permission to speed so close to the Chancellor George Osborne’s autumn statement on December 5 when he is under pressure to ditch a planned 3p a litre tax rise. An AA spokesman said: ‘It is surprising. But if the taxman is racing around above the speed-limit, he or she will quickly feel the pain of rising pump prices already felt by 33 million motorists.’ But the consultation paper notes: ‘HMRC are involved in covert surveillance of major organised crime. ‘Nationally there are approximately 10 concurrent operational deployments per day involving 500 officers from the criminal Investigation Directorate.’ Difference between life and death: Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said it is about time they started top look at exemptions for other services . The DfT consultation will also look . at amending road safety legislation so that emergency drivers would be . required by law to complete high-speed training before exceeding the . limit. But this will . not place any additional burden on police, fire and ambulance services . which already run an effective voluntary training scheme, it said. HMRC officers are given ‘blue light’ training, but not speed training, it added. Those used to seeing James Bond . thrashing his Aston Martin in high speed chases on the big screen may be . intrigued to learn of the intention to also bring the Security Services . under the umbrella of exemptions. The report notes: ‘Due to the sensitive nature of the covert operations, public information is limited. However, the Department is content that the internal procedures set out by the services are of the highest standard.’ Meanwhile, Bomb Squad units currently respond to 3,500 call outs a year of which 30 per cent are explosive devices. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Police, fire and ambulance service drivers are highly trained individuals who are at times required to exceed the speed limit in order to save lives. ‘It is only right that we look at allowing other services whose duties can mean the difference between life and death to exceed the speed limit when responding to emergencies. ‘It is also time to look at the legal requirements of emergency vehicle training so we can build on the rigorous standards the police, fire and ambulance services have already applied through their code of practice.’ ‘While emergency service drivers are not exempt from the offences of dangerous and careless driving, the current legislation allows drivers in some circumstances to break speed limits legally as well as exempting them from certain traffic regulations. The consultation closes on February 27, 2013.","HM Revenue and Customs seeking exemption for its 'covert surveillance vehicles'

"She should have been walking down the aisle, but instead Caroline Wozniacki will be running through the streets of New York. The 24-year-old tennis star announced she will be running the New York marathon this November at a time that had been scheduled for her wedding with Rory McIlroy. The former world number one made the announcement earlier today and said she will run with Olympic silver medalist and Boston marathon winner Meb Keflezighi. Runner: Caroline Wozniacki says she will run the New York marathon in November . If she completes the race, Wozniacki will join an elite list of sportsmen and women to have run the 26.2 mile course during their professional careers. That group includes disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong, who competed before he made his infamous Tour de France comeback in 2007. Despite topping the world rankings for over a year at one stage, the Danish star has never actually won a major. She made the final of the 2009 US Open but was beaten in starlight sets by Kim Clijsters. Partners: The Danish star will team up with Olympic silver medalist Meb Keflezighi to run the 26.2 miles .
