"The Queen has visited Prince Philip in hospital where he is said to be recovering well from the infection which forced him to miss the final two days of her spectacular Diamond Jubilee celebrations. She arrived at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London at 5.10pm, hours after Buckingham Palace said his condition had 'improved considerably' and that he was in 'good spirits'. The Duke of York also went to visit his father, arriving half an hour after the Queen, who stayed a little over 45 minutes. Despite his progress, the  Duke of Edinburgh is still expected to spend the next few days in hospital, where he has been since Monday, until he makes a full recovery. It is not known whether he will be out in time to celebrate his 91st birthday on Sunday. The Queen leaves the King Edward VII hospital after visiting Prince Philip who is recovering from a bladder infection . Prince Andrew, Duke of York, waves to photographers as he arrives at the King Edward VII hospital to visit Prince Philip . The Queen arrives at the hospital where Prince Philip is being treated for a bladder infection . A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The treatment of . his infection continues with antibiotics. He is likely to remain in . hospital over the next few days. He is in good spirits.' The illness forced the Duke to miss several key events of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, including a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral and the concert outside Buckingham Palace. The Earl and Countess of Wessex visited the Duke with their children Louise and James yesterday. After . their 25-minute visit, Edward said his father was feeling 'much better' and appeared to be  making a . good recovery . He added that the Duke had . watched the thanksgiving service at St Paul’s on television. ‘He’s feeling a lot better, he just needs some rest,’ he . added. He said the Queen was ‘bearing up’ but added: ‘She’s missing him, obviously.’ Edward’s wife, Sophie, said . the Duke was ‘naturally upset’ to miss the celebrations but added: ‘He’s . on good form. He is in good spirits.’ The Queen and Prince Philip endured four hours in the wind and rain onboard the Spirit of Chartwell during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on June 3 . Although . bladder infections are quite common in men of Prince Philip’s age, . doctors are monitoring him closely, not least because he had heart . surgery less than six months ago. The Queen has continued with her public . Jubilee duties stoically despite her husband's ill health but is being . regularly updated on his condition. Asked how his mother was coping, . Edward replied: 'She is bearing up but missing him, obviously. Thank you . very much for your concern. It is much appreciated.' Queen is all smiles as she arrives at Commonwealth lunch after news Prince Philip is feeling better, while yesterday her concern showed during Thanksgiving service . Prime Minister David Cameron said that everyone is concerned about the health of the Duke after he was . taken to hospital with an infection. Mr . Cameron said he was sure the Queen and the Duke would have gone ahead . with Sunday’s river pageant in torrential rain regardless of the risks . to their health after the day’s exertions - spending four hours on the . water - were blamed for his turn of ill-health. Speaking . to Sky News, Mr Cameron said: 'It was a most extraordinary spectacle . and obviously everyone is very concerned and worried and wants to know . that (the Duke) is going to be OK. Poignant: The Queen, accompanied by Prince . Philip for the River Pageant on Sunday, was on her own for . the Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace after he was taken . to hospital suffering from a bladder infection . Unwell: Prince Philip waves during Sunday's pageant . Royal visit: Prince Edward arrives at the King Edward VII Hospital near Paddington, London, this afternoon to visit the Duke of Edinburgh who he said has been watching the Jubilee celebrations on the television . Royal departure: Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, and her son James, leave the hospital after visiting the Duke of Edinburgh this afternoon . IN older people a muddled mind can be one of the first signs of a bladder infection and can occur remarkably quickly. The onset of such symptoms can be alarming for family members, especially if the person affected is normally fit and well. The changes can be mistaken for early signs of dementia, or even a stroke. If it is left untreated it can lead to hallucinations or agitation. Most doctors will, however, recognise the signs and order a urine test. They can then use a working diagnosis of a urinary tract infection until the test results arrive. Antibiotics are standard treatment and effective, especially when given intravenously – bringing the patient back to normality within a few days. Harley Street doctor Malcolm Vandeburg said the duke’s condition could be a sign of other issues with his health. He said: ‘In a man of around 90, the thing that you would think of is some form of bladder outlet obstruction which would, at the top of the list, be some form of obstruction around the prostate.’ But he also stressed that if treated early, the condition was very controllable. 'The thing about our Royal Family is . that they are incredibly dedicated to what they do and they are . incredibly dedicated to doing it, no matter what the circumstances. 'I don’t know all the conversations . that took place but I would be pretty certain that Her Majesty and the . Duke of Edinburgh would have wanted to do what they did and would have . carried on doing it.' On Monday night the Queen was visibly . moved as Prince Charles joked that the Duke of Edinburgh might hear the . Jubilee concert from his bed if the crowd shouted loud enough. In a warm, emotional and often witty . speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert, . that appeared to make her lip quiver more than once, the . Prince of Wales said it was sad that the Duke of Edinburgh could not be . at the event after being taken unwell . While the Duke’s condition is not . believed to be serious, doctors will not be taking any chances, given . his advancing years, because bladder infections in the elderly can get . worse very quickly if not treated promptly. Questions are likely to be asked . whether it was wise to allow the Duke, who had a stent inserted in his . heart less than six months ago, to take part in Sunday’s Diamond Jubilee . Pageant, standing in the rain for four hours. It is understood that staff at . ambulance control in Berkshire received a call from Windsor Castle . shortly after 2pm reporting that Prince Philip was feeling unwell. The medical crew used a chair to help him into the ambulance. Despite his advancing years the . Queen’s husband has largely enjoyed good health and most of his past . ailments have been sports-related. Before undergoing heart surgery at . Christmas his most recent previous illness was a cold in October last . year which forced him to pull out of an overnight stay in Italy. One of his most serious bouts of ill . health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in London with a . chronic chest infection. The Duke’s absence from the rest of the Diamond Jubilee events will come as a terrible blow to his wife of 64 years. Although she is, ostensibly, the ‘senior partner’ in their relationship, she relies on her husband ‘utterly’. ‘It may be a cliché but he truly is the power behind the throne,’ said a source.","Duke of Edinburgh was taken ill with a bladder infection after spending four hours standing in the cold and rain during Thames Jubilee Pageant on Sunday .

"A secret letter which documents a . private meeting between King George V urging his Foreign Secretary Edward Grey to . go to war with Germany two days before the outbreak of the First World War has been unearthed. The incredible note, sent during . one of the most difficult times in British history has been made public for the first time, by Adrian Graves, Sir . Edward’s great-great-nephew and grandson of Sir Cecil Graves. King George V, who had stayed . away from making public declarations about Europe as his hands were tied as a constitutional monarch, said it . was ‘absolutely essential’ Britain go to war in order to prevent Germany from . achieving ‘complete domination of this country’. Private meeting: King George V, left, met and urged his Foreign Secretary Edward Grey, right, to . go to war with Germany two days before the First World War . However when his Foreign . Secretary Sir Edward said that the cabinet hadn’t found a justifiable reason to . enter the conflict, the King replied: ‘You have got to find a reason, Grey.’ Adrian Graves inherited Sir . Cecil’s papers which he kept in their original Asprey case next to his fishing tackle but had never looked at them. He told The Telegraph: ‘My . grandfather was involved in the First World War – he was one of the first to be . captured, at the Battle of Mons, and later awarded the Military Cross. The case . contained some of his records and papers relating to the war and his captivity. ‘I decided to look through . through them as the centenary of August 4 was coming up, and I came across an . envelope. Written on the front were the words, ‘Interview with King’. I had . never known it was there,’ But they held a treasure-trove of . information. In a letter written by Sir Cecil, Sir Edward’s nephew, he details a meeting that took place between him and the King, who summoned him to Buckingham Palace a month after his uncle’s death . in 1933. Buckingham Palace: The royal car with King George is pictured leaving Buckingham Palace - it was here that he summoned Sir Cecil Graves for a meeting where he talked about Edward Grey . The letter told how King George V offered his condolences then recalled the events . of 1914 to Sir Cecil. Sir Cecil wrote: 'He told me of . the interview he had with Uncle Edward two days before the outbreak of war. It . lasted for one and a half hours. ‘He told me that Uncle Edward had . said that he could not possibly see what justifiable reason we could find for . going to war. HM said in reply, ‘You have got . to find a reason, Grey.’ The incredible meeting between the King and his Foreign Secretary is not . recorded in any history book. World War I: King George V said Britain should go to war in order to prevent Germany from achieving complete domination of this country . Edward Grey, was a British Liberal statesman. He was also the first Viscount Grey of Fallodon. He served as Foreign Secretary from 1905 to 1916, which was the longest continuous tenure of any person in that office. He is probably best remembered for his remark at the outbreak of war: 'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our time'. But it shows the importance placed on . defeating Germany's plans. Sir Cecil also revealed that a . private letter from Raymond Poincaré, the French President, encouraging Britain to go to . war and a telegram from King Albert about . Belgium was also sent from the King to Sir Edward. On August 3, Sir Edward gave a . speech to Parliament over Europe’s instability. He returned to his room in the . Foreign Office and made the now famous remark as he watched the lamps being lit . outside: 'The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit . again in our lifetime.'

"Opulent processions, well-coiffed royals and a few European landmarks thrown in - it is the perfect light watching to ease you into the day. And television networks didn't miss a trick with the Queen's Jubilee, sending out their big names - topped with a variety of obnoxious hats - to cover the four-day event in London. With the UK five hours ahead of Eastern time, the festivities fall perfectly for morning television.  And as the celebration reaches its conclusion on Tuesday,  the networks battle for the best coverage. Together again: Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira were reunited as co-hosts at Buckingham Palace while cover the Queen's Jubilee clebration for the Today show . Leading the pack has been the Today show, which sent Meredith Vieira to preview the long weekend's festivities on Friday from the Tower of London. She has since been at the helm of the show's coverage, broadcasting from Buckingham Palace. On Tuesday, NBC added more big names to the mix, sending out Al Roker and Matt Lauer to join her. Vieira had previously warned them to 'bring the long . johns' to fight the weather, but joked that the drizzle made 'the events . more British, not less'. CNN flashed jubilant scenes of thousands of well wishers waving flags along The Mall. Piers Morgan and Brooke Baldwin will lead the live CNN broadcast live for two hours starting at 9 a.m. ET. Getting to know the people: Today's Al Roker mingles with the crowds in London to ask about the Jubilee . Coverage: Vieira flew to London last week to preview events. She is joined by CNN and Good Morning America . Protests by British republicans – a mere footnote in the UK -- are enjoying prime-time coverage on Iranian state-run television channels which have ignored the loyal majority’s revelry. 'Chants of Monarchy Out! Republic In echo in UK,' trumpeted a headline on the website of Iran’s English language Press TV. Tehran’s main Persian language channel, IRTV 1, declared that the Queen should shoulder some responsible for Britain’s 'grave economic situation.' It opined: 'The extravagant spending of the Queen, including the expensive wedding of Prince William, her annual tours and festivities and the current diamond jubilee celebrations have added to the problems.' RTV 1featured a protestor proclaiming, 'I speak on behalf of millions of British people who are opposed to the monarchist system.' Iran has been staunchly republican since its Islamic revolution in 1979 overthrew 2,500 years of monarchy. Good . Morning America is hosting 'GMA at the Jubilee' with Robin Roberts . broadcasting live from outside Buckingham Palace, interviewing British . celebrities while looking at processions below.

But, . while UK viewers reveled in the wonderment of the concert on Monday . night - featuring Kylie Minogue, Will.i.am and Elton John, among others - . U.S. audiences were comparatively hard done by. ABC nabbed exclusive rights to the show and presented excerpts from 9 p.m. ET during 20/20: Concert for the Queen. Coverage of the occasion has varied across the world. Republican France celebrated the Queen's Diamond Jubilee as if its own Revolution had never happened. The celebrations in London dominated TV screens and newspapers, with Le Monde correspondent Marc Roche saying the French 'don't know much about the Queen, but they like the pomp and circumstance, they like the grandeur of the institution.' More than 3.5million watched a three-and-a-half hour live Jubilee special on France 2 television on Sunday afternoon. 'We got 26.3 per cent of the audience, despite the French Open tennis tournament being on at the same time on another channel,' said Yannick Letranchant, who commissioned the programme. Last year's Royal Wedding and the success of the film 'The King's Speech' has made the British monarch extremely popular. Princess Diana, who died in Paris in 1997, is also remembered with great fondness. 'We have no royal family, so we end up with characters like Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni living like royals,' said Parisian Genevieve Blanc. 'They are nothing like as impressive as the real thing, and in fact end up embarrassing us. This is one of the main reasons why we envy the British.' All newspapers covered the Jubilee on their front page at some point, with Figaro giving a number of reasons why the Queen is 'cool again'. In Italy, the were covered extensively on the TV, newspapers, radio and internet with photographs of the river pageant dominating - as well as several pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge looking regal in her bright red dress.

The four-day event concludes today . Family: Prince Charles, Prince William, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge leave the service . Every morning, the main channels had a . live link-up via their London correspondents to describe the previous . day's events and go through proceedings. Even British Rome-based correspondents were asked to contribute an opinion. Italian coverage highlighted how a . Venetian gondola had taken part in the river pageant and all the . coverage described how despite the dismal weather that more than a . million people turned up to see the spectacle - underlining the strength . of feeling for the Queen. Repubblica described the Queen as . 'Elizabeth the Great' adding how the crowds had been 'partying wildly' throughout the whole weekend. Corriere Della Sera said the pageant . had 'told the story of the Windsors,navigating through crisis and . splendour, through love and intrigue'. Il Messaggero described the . celebrations as an 'unprecedented spectacle' adding how the . photographers had all been 'pointing their cameras towards Kate as well . as the Queen, with her stunning red dress.' Jubilant: The Jubilee events - which conclude today - will be widely covered by US television networks today . The coverage also highlighted how the . Duke of Edinburgh had been forced to miss the last two days of . celebrations after 'bravely enduring the cold for four hours', but the . Queen had continued with the festivities once informed he was doing well . in hospital. BBC Worldwide aired the Diamond . Jubilee Celebrations on channels across Asia, Australia, New Zealand, . Latin America, India, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. A . spokesperson said it was still too early to obtain exact viewing . figures, but said they had already received 'amazing feedback.' In . Australia there was an outcry as ABC shunned the celebrations and . showed a repeat of raunchy Warren Beatty movie Shampoo instead. Australians for Constitutional Monarchy head, Professor David Flint, has  attacked the ABC for the snub. 'I think it is absolutely appalling and astounding,' Professor Flint said. In . Canada, CBC covered an extensive amount of the celebrations and . reported that more than a million Canadians watched their coverage . yesterday morning. In the spirit: Elise Pearce holds a flag showing the Queen while waiting for the carriage procession during the Diamond Jubilee on Tuesday . It . seemed that on a worldwide basis, the Jubilee received much lighter . coverage from the media than the Royal Wedding in April 2011. 'I . assumed the ABC was going to at least broadcast the central events, as . you would expect them to do a royal wedding or a coronation.' On Tuesday night, ABC in the U.S. will broadcast two-hour highlights of the concert from 9 p.m. ET. Audiences . still have the Ceremonial day to look forward to, where the queen and . royal family and 2,000 British worthies will attend an Anglican . thanksgiving service at St. Paul's Cathedral. After this, the queen and royal . family will attend private receptions, then a lunch at Westminster Hall . before taking a procession, lined with military bands and troops, back . to Buckingham Palace. Around 3:30 p.m. local time - 10.30 a.m. ET - the royal family will assemble on the balcony. Good Morning America, World News with Diane Sawyer and Nightline will broadcast throughout the day. In addition to the U.S. channels, BBC . America has been offering wide coverage. On Tuesday, BBC America will . broadcast live from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET. All smiles: There will be a procession later today before the royal family assemble on the balcony . It comes after some channels also heavily previewed the weekend's events. Viera popped out to London well ahead of the festivities to preview events from the Tower of London on Friday. And in last week's ABC special,The Jubilee Queen with Katie Couric, the beloved anchor quizzed Princes William and Harry, as well as the Duke of York and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. While colourful scenes were splashed across television screens, the coverage by the American newspapers was comparatively lifeless. In the U.S. newspapers, mentions . of the widespread parties and the Queen's processions have been sparse, . hidden in the back pages and squashed alongside the ads. Instead, the press, including the New York Post and the New York Times, focused on the bad news from the weekend - Prince Philip's trip to hospital. The Queen's husband, who turns 91 this weekend, was admitted to hospital on Monday with a bladder infection and will remain there for a few days as a precaution.","On a worldwide basis the .

"Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has revealed that as part of his exercise regime he jumps up and down on a trampoline with his dog while naked. In a wide-ranging interview the 66-year-old politician was asked about his unusual hobby after posting on his Twitter account earlier this month that he had been 'trampolining since dawn'.

I don't do it with any great expertise, I just do it more for enjoyment. We just go out for a bounce for a while. 'The dog does it with me so it saves me having to take him for a walk.

"It wasn't just members of the royal family turning heads at this morning's thanksgiving service, as the politician's wives stepped into the spotlight. Overall they demonstrated a sharp sense of style - Samantha Cameron looking especially sophisticated in a black, silk Paul Smith dress and netted beret - however some stood out for all the wrong reasons. Sally Bercow, who made up the 2,000-strong congregation offered onlookers a generous glimpse of thigh as she exited St Paul's Cathedral wearing a black and white ensemble with her husband and Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow in tow. Last year the 42-year-old's fashion sense was scrutinised as she showed scant regard for royal protocol when she attended the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in a black lace wrap dress with plunging neckline and daring hemline, complete with split. Dressed to impress: Sally Bercow, Samantha Cameron and Miriam Gonzales were among today's congregation at St Paul's Cathedral . Nick Clegg's spouse Miriam Gonzales also made an impression choosing a bright fuchsia number adorned with an eye-catching rose design, as did Boris Johnson's wife Marina who fashioned a bold silk scarlet gown, accessorised with a striking feather headpiece.. Meanwhile Justine Thornton - accompanying husband and Labour leader Ed Miliband - and Foreign Secretary William Hague's partner Ffion plumped for  neutral colours. The nation will celebrate the Diamond . Jubilee at a service of thanksgiving today, but missing from the Queen's . side will be the Duke of Edinburgh. Philip is being treated in hospital for a bladder infection and will not be part of a series of events today, planned to mark the Queen's 60-year milestone.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will give the sermon at the St Paul's Cathedral thanksgiving service and is expected to pay tribute to the Queen. Gathered will be leading national figures and members of the Royal Family including Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Prime Minister David Cameron will lead the large representation from the coalition Government and other figures will include governor generals, diplomats and foreign leaders. After the 10.30am service, conducted by the Dean of St Paul’s, The Very Reverend Dr David Ison, the Queen will attend a reception at Mansion House while other senior royals including Charles and Camilla will attend a similar event at the Guildhall. At both events will be members of the thanksgiving congregation. Labour leader Ed Miliband poses for a shot with wife Justine who chose a  navy blue and cream ensemble .

The Queen and her family will then attend a City of London Livery companies lunch at Westminster Hall - The Livery Companies of the City of . London originated in medieval times as Guilds responsible for trade . regulation, including checking the quality of goods, weights and . measures and training. Today the companies use their funds to undertake charitable and community work. Some 700 guests representing the . companies’ abundant trades and professions, ranging from grocers and . gunmakers to fruiterers and fishmongers, will join for the . tribute. Prince William will be placed at the Engineers and Arbitrators table, while Kate will be joined by the Master Glovers and Pattenmakers. The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers . was founded in the 17th century as a trade association for the makers . of pattens - under-shoes of wood and metal which were worn strapped . beneath the shoes to raise the wearer out of the mud on the streets. The Company now draws its membership . from the City of London and the Footwear industry, with its main focus . being charitable works. The Worshipful Company of Glovers was formed in 1349 by glove makers in London to protect their craft. Harry will be on the Fruiterers and Gardeners table. Among the vast range of participating . Livery companies are the Worshipful Companies of Goldsmiths, Butchers, . Innholders, Weavers, Distillers, Clockmakers and even Tax Advisers. London Mayor Boris Johnson and his wife Marina arrive at St Paul's Cathedral for the morning event . 2,000 people were invited to the National Service of Thanksgiving to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee . Guests will dine on marinated Uist . Island salmon with Lyme Bay crab, followed by saddle of Welsh Cambrian . Mountain lamb with braised shoulder of lamb, grilled Isle of Wight . asparagus, Jersey Royal potatoes and an aptly named Jubilee sauce. The 'symphony of dessert' is chocolate delice, bread and butter pudding and berry compote with Sandringham apple sauce . A Ceylon tea will also be served made . from a bush planted by the Duke of Edinburgh during a state visit to Sri . Lanka in 1954 in the Pedro Tea Plantation in Nuwara Eliya. The National Children’s Orchestra of Great Britain will perform during the event while the House of Commons’ speaker John . Bercow will say grace and the loyal toast will be proposed by the Lord . Speaker Baroness D’Souza. The highlight of the day will be a glittering carriage procession through the streets of Whitehall before the Queen and her family gather on Buckingham Palace's balcony to watch a flypast of Second World War aircraft and the Red Arrows. The Prince of Wales paid a heartfelt tribute to his mother last night, following the Diamond Jubilee concert staged near Buckingham Palace. Stood on stage with the Queen a few feet away, Charles told hundreds of thousands who had gathered to watch the star-studded event that they were 'celebrating the life and service of a very special person'. But he added there was a disappointing element to the night. Build up on the Mall, ahead of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Procession . 'The only sad thing about this evening is that my father cannot be her with us because unfortunately he's taken unwell,"" he said.The Prince went on to say: 'And we're now celebrating the life and service of a very special person, over the last 60 years. I was three when my grandfather George VI died and suddenly, unexpectedly you and my father's lives were irrevocably changed when you were only 26. 'So as a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us. For inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British.' Celebrities attending the concert included Brian May, who famously played the national anthem on the palace's roof during the 2002 Golden Jubilee concert, television presenters Floella Benjamin and Kirstie Allsopp, and ex-Bond Girl Barbara Bach who is married to former Beatle Ringo Starr. Many of the hosts, who included Lenny Henry and Jimmy Carr, poked fun at the royals. But Rob Brydon got one of the biggest laughs from the crowds when he said: 'Sixty years of reign. Sounds like a Welsh summer.' Kylie Minogue arrived on stage dressed as a Pearly Queen, wearing a romper-style black shorts suit adorned with mother of pearl buttons. She completed the look with a black jacket that had a crown design in buttons on the back, and a peak cap. Sir Elton John's Crocodile Rock was one of the biggest tunes of the night, with William, Harry and Beatrice singing and dancing in their seats to the 70s tune. The palace was transformed into a row of terraced houses, via a projection, for Madness' performance from the historic building's roof. Lead singer Suggs ended the tune Our House by changing one of the lines of the lyric and saying in a posh accent, 'In the middle of one's street'.The royals stood for the final act, Sir Paul McCartney, who ran through a string of Beatles songs including Magical Mystery Tour, All My Loving and Let It Be. After Charles' speech there was a huge fireworks display fired from the roof of the palace.","Sally Bercow opts for thigh-skimming black and white shift dress .

"A student who found what appeared to be a chicken brain in his KFC meal has vowed never to eat there again - despite being offered vouchers for free food as an apology. Ibrahim Langoo was left nauseated after spotting a 'wrinkled brain' inside a piece of chicken while tucking into a Gladiator box meal at a branch in Colchester, Essex. The 19-year-old took a photograph of the three-inch piece of offal - later judged to be a kidney by KFC's experts - on his mobile phone and complained to staff. Nauseated: Horrified student Ibrahim Langoo, 19, . who found what looked like a lump of brain attached to a piece of chicken . in his KFC Gladiator box meal at a branch in Colchester, Essex . He was so repulsed by the stomach-churning discovery he vowed never to eat at the Colonel's famous diner again, but apologetic bosses nevertheless offered him vouchers for free meals. Mr Langoo and friend Laura Canning, 19, had popped into the Colchester, Essex branch of the fast food restaurant - known for its 'Finger Lickin' Good' slogan - for lunch between classes. The pair - both musical theatre students at Colchester Institute - shared a £6.79 Gladiator box meal. Miss Canning ate the fillet burger, while Mr Langoo went for the two chicken pieces. 'The first piece was absolutely fine - I was hungry and polished it off,' Mr Langoo said. 'I have a habit of picking the chicken off the bone with my fingers, and as I pulled the second piece apart I saw this horrible wrinkled foreign body. 'I threw it down onto my tray immediately. It looked like a brain. 'I suddenly felt grim and really sick. 'I couldn't bring myself to pick the lump up so I went to the serving counter to complain. 'It was about 1pm and pretty hectic in the restaurant and as it was so busy none of the staff helped me.' Wrinkly: A photo taken by Mr Langoo on his mobile phone of the brain like discovery. KFC experts later said they believed it was a chicken kidney and the company have offered the young man vouchers for more free food . Repulsed, Mr Langoo left the takeaway and later submitted a complaint online, along with a photo of the organ taken on his mobile phone. 'I didn't want to pick the ""brain"" up as I couldn't bear to look at it,' Mr Langoo said. 'I was grossed out by the fact that I could so easily have eaten it without realising. 'I just wanted to get out of KFC as quickly as I could. I still feel really sick and disgusted by it all now. 'KFC say they are sorry and are concerned to hear of my experience as they have ""rigorous standards"" but I'm still not impressed. 'I never want to eat KFC again - in Colchester or anywhere else. I'll eat chicken at home, where I can see how it's been prepared.' Experts at KFC have examined the photograph and believe the unsightly organ was a chicken kidney. A spokesman for the firm said: 'We always try to ensure the highest standards in all of our restaurants. 'Although we haven't received the product, it appears from a photograph that unfortunately on this occasion a kidney, and not a brain as claimed, was not removed in the preparation process. 'We're very sorry about Mr Langoo's experience and while there was no health risk, we agree it was unsightly. 'We will be carrying out a full investigation and providing him with a gesture of goodwill.' KFC refused to disclose the amount of vouchers that could be available.","Ibrahim Langoo found the brain-like organ in a Gladiator box meal .

"And to think this wasn’t deemed attractive enough for television? What more do they want? League One versus Premier League, old boys with scores to settle, a deafening capacity crowd and a pitch which even cattle would turn their noses up at. And boy did it deliver, Phil Parkinson’s Bradford City – heroic conquerors of Premier League leaders Chelsea in the last round – booking their place in the quarter-final for the first time in 39 years. Click here for Craig Hope's full match report . Host commentator . That's it from today's game between Bradford and Sunderland. You can follow our live commentary of Arsenal's match against Middlesbrough by clicking HERE. League One side Bradford have progressed to the sixth round of the FA Cup, while Sunderland failed to turn up. They were left stunned in the first three minutes when John O'Shea put through his own net and former Black Cats forward Jon Stead ensured his side progressed to the next round by scoring past Vito Mannone. Stead receives a tremendous reception from the home fans as he makes his way off the pitch. Another fine performance by the former Premier League star. It seems a bit too late but Poyet has decided to throw on U21 star Honeyman and Vergini with just four minutes left on the clock. Sunderland have 10 minutes to get themselves back in the match. Wickham, Fletcher and Johnson have failed to deliver so far. Can they change the outcome of the match? Time is ticking. Phil Parkinson brings on Halliday, who scored in Bradford's win at Chelsea. Wickham's goalbound shot has just been blocked by his team-mate. It really hasn't been Sunderland's day. Bradford fans are now singing 'You're getting sacked in the morning' towards Poyet. It's not going to be that bad for the Uruguayan but it is a big opportunity missed if they fail to at least earn a replay - which is looking incredibly unlikely. Mannone is flapping at everything. Will Poyet's decision to rest Pantilimon may come back to haunt him! Just under 20 minutes left to play. What was Adam Johnson doing? A player of his calibre should not be trying to play the ball across goal. That's something you learn as a schoolboy. 67 minutes gone and Sunderland are showing signs of frustration. Jones has just been booked. Bradford's Stead punishes his former side for two horrific errors. Firstly Adam Johnson tries to pass the ball across his box and then Stead's feeble shot somehow manages to find a way past Mannone. Poor goalkeeping by the Italian. The Black Cats are starting to control possession. Alvarez seems to be seeing a lot of the ball but he has been unable to pick out Wickham and Fletcher thus far. Jermain Defoe has been left out of today's squad due to a slight groin injury. Poyet would probably love to be able to call on the striker! As predicted Wickham has replaced Graham in attack. Poyet will be hoping the 21-year-old can pose more of a threat in attack. Just to recap, League One side Bradford go into the interval with a 1-0 lead thanks to an own goal by John O'Shea after just three minutes. The Bantams' goal was fortunate but fully deserved as they have been the better team. Adam Johnson has just sent a free-kick over the bar. The Sunderland winger has been unable to get on the ball and really run at Bradford's defence. Poyet is going to have to make a change at the interval - whether it is to the personnel or his side's shape. There has been a lot of talk about Van Gaal's use of long balls during the last few weeks but it is working wonders for Bradford. Their wide players are firing crosses into the middle of the penalty area, which Sunderland are struggling to cope with. Just under two minutes until the interval. Bradford goalkeeper Williams has finally been tested. Van Aaholt's shot was deflected but the home side are able to clear. Poyet does not look happy on the sidelines as his side remain 1-0 down. Larsson has been booked for a late challenge. 38 minutes gone and Bradford continue to dictate play. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet will be already weighing up his options to make a possible change at half-time. His forward players have failed to take the game to Bradford. Wickham could be an option. Here's Sunderland's bench: Pantilimon, Wickham, Jordi Gomez, Coates, Vergini, Honeyman, Agnew . I think Sunderland's defence are going to struggle to contain former Sunderland striker Jon Stead today. He's winning everything in the air ahead of Brown and O'Shea. Bradford look extremely comfortable so far. 24 minutes gone and Sunderland have hardly tested Bantams goalkeeper Williams. The likes of Johnson and Fletcher have failed to show their class. Six yards out with whole goal to aim at, how long did Steven Fletcher want?! Brilliant challenge from Rory McArdle. Fletcher should be ashamed claiming for a penalty. Sunderland are finding it hard to get used to the pitch. Jones just stopped to stare at the turf after failing to get the ball under control. Bradford will say the conditions are the same for both sides. Sunderland striker Fletcher has just had a golden opportunity to level the scoreline. He had an incredible amount of time to pick his spot but was tackled as he was about to pull the trigger. Fletcher wanted a penalty but the referee waved play on. The score remains 1-0 to Bradford after 19 minutes. This has been a frenetic start - the early goal, two head injuries and Gus Poyet losing his rag with referee Kevin Friend (twice). But Sunderland's lacklustre start can be summed up by Ricky Alvarez appearing to be scared of the ball as it dropped from the sky, ducking out of a free header! I don't think this is his sort of contest... I was just about to say Bradford's pitch is in a terrible condition before O'Shea put through his own net. Could that work in the League One side's favour? Clarke celebrated Bradford's opener as he took the original shot however it will go down as an own goal as the ball was going wide before O'Shea's deflection. Clarke's shot was going wide until O'Shea stuck out his leg to divert the ball into his own net. The Bantams probably cannot believe their luck but the scoreline is all what matters. Bradford have taken the lead after just three minutes. Clarke took a shot at goal from inside the penalty area which was deflected in off Sunderland defender O'Shea. Bradford XI: Williams, Darby, McArdle, Davies, Meredith, Liddle, Morais, Knott, Clarke, Hanson, Stead . Sunderland XI:  Mannone, Jones, van Aanholt, Brown, O’Shea, Bridcutt, Larsson, Johnson, Alvarez, Fletcher, Graham . Can Bradford follow up their shock 4-2 win against Chelsea by defeating Sunderland? Or will the Black Cats prove to be too strong for the League One side? Sportsmail promises to give you the answers as we provide you with live commentary of today's match at Valley Parade. Stay tuned for team news. League One side Bradford will be hoping to follow up their shock 4-2 FA Cup win against Premier League leaders Chelsea by eliminating Sunderland.

"A 19-year-old man in Tacoma, Washington, has pleaded guilty to raping and murdering his girlfriend's two-year-old son. Jake Musga pleaded guilty on Monday to first degree murder and child rape in the death of Laura Colley’s son Chayson. He could spend the rest of his life in prison after prosecutors confirmed that they will be asking the judge to sentence Musga to 60 years to life when he is sentenced in November. When Chayson Colley, held here by  his mom Laura, was taken to hospital doctors said he showed no significant brain activity, had bleeding in his brain and stomach, had suffered a collapsed lung and bruising around his rectum . Jake Musga, 19, from Tacoma, Washington is facing life in prison after pleading guilty on Monday to raping and murdering Laura Colley's two-year-old son Chayson . The incident happened on March 30, when a witness called 911 to report that they had found Musga holding a baby ‘covered with bruises’ at the Commencement Terrace apartment complex. Chayson was taken to a local hospital where doctors said he showed no significant brain activity, had bleeding in his brain and stomach, had suffered a collapsed lung and bruising around his rectum, and registered a blood-alcohol level of .12, court records show. The legal limit for drivers in Washington is .08. Musga, who is not the child's father, told Tacoma police that he was watched the child when the boy's mother was out at a party, reports The News Tribune. According to police, he claimed the injuries resulted from a series of events days earlier where the boy had accidents, such as bumping his head on a counter, slipping in the shower, and falling out of bed. Chayson Colley was just two years old and starting to talk when he was brutally murdered by his mom's boyfriend Jake Musga, 19 . In his plea paperwork Jake Musga, left, admitted that he killed Chayson Colley, right, because the toddler had urinated on him . He also claimed he had poured himself a drink with multiple shots of vodka and that the boy must have drank some while he was in another room. But an autopsy revealed the boy had suffered injuries ‘too numerous to count,’ including fatal blows to the head and torso that were inconsistent with the events Musga described, prosecutors said. Musga initially pleaded not guilty to the crimes, but has since admitted to the murder and acknowledged the crimes warrant an exceptional sentence, prosecutors say. In his plea paperwork Musga admitted that he killed Chayson because the toddler had urinated on him. ‘Nothing shocks the conscience more than the murder of a child,’ said prosecutor Mark Lindquist. ‘We are asking the court for the functional equivalent of a life-sentence.’ The standard sentence range is 22 years to life in prison, but prosecutors will be asking the judge to sentence Musga to 60 years to life. When he is sentenced in November. The incident happened on March 30, when a witness called 911 to report that they had found Musga holding a baby 'covered with bruises' at the Commencement Terrace apartment complex . At Chayson’s funeral in April his mom’s family celebrated his short life and fondly recalled how he had learned how to say ‘Love you’ in the last weeks of his life. During the service, Laura Colley wrote and read what she characterized as a letter to her son in heaven, reports TheDailyWorld.com. ‘To my beloved son, Chayson, my favorite part of the day was at the end of the day when we were both so tired and we would lay together with your hand in mine and you would look up at me and smile and grab my face with both your hands and kiss me,’ she wrote. ‘And you would say, “Love you!” and I’d say it back. It felt so good to be loved by you. You were my every reason for being. 'No matter how long, bad or rough the day was, when I would hear you laugh, everything became good again. It was true bliss being with you. My heart will ache every day until we are together again.’ Video: Tacoma man pleads guilty to raping and killing two-year-old .","Jake Musga, 19, faces spending the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty to first degree murder .

"A 35-year-old Florida man found not guilty by reason of insanity in the death of a homeless man has been committed to up to 60 years in a Connecticut psychiatric hospital. In July a . three-judge panel in Bridgeport agreed that Tyree Lincoln Smith had killed - and partially eaten - homeless man Angel 'Tun Tun' Gonzales, but that he hadn't committed murder per se because he was mentally ill. The panel met again on Monday to determine what to do with Smith. They could have ordered his release, but Superior Court Judge John Kavanewsky said he believed Smith would be a danger to himself and others if discharged. Insane: Tyree Lincoln Smith, pictured in court in July, was sentenced to 60 years in a Connecticut psychiatric hospital on Monday . Smith stunned the courtroom on Monday when he got up and apologized prior to the panel making their decision. 'I'm really sorry for what I did, that I couldn't be myself,' he said. 'It really had nothing to do with the other person.' In the back of the courtroom a relative of Gonzalez, Talitha Frazier, burst into tears. 'We waited two years to hear Tyree say he was sorry,' she told the Connecticut Post. 'What he said today caught me off-guard, but I feel he meant what he said.' Justice: Talitha Frazier, left, sister-in-law of the victim Angel Gonzalez, right, burst into tears when Smith apologized for murdering her relative . In January 2012 Gonzalez's mutilated body was found on the . third floor of an abandoned home in Bridgeport, where Smith had lived as . a child. Smith came to the attention of authorities when his cousin, Nicole Rabb, contacted Bridgeport police. She . told detectives that Smith had arrived at her house on December 15, . 2011, talking about Greek gods and how he wanted to 'get blood on his hands.' Then he said he was going to the . abandoned home where he used to live, according to an arrest warrant . affidavit. The next day, Smith returned to the cousin's house with blood on his pants and he was carrying chopsticks and a bloody axe. Police say he told his cousin he . had 'gotten his blood'. Smith . told his cousin, Nicole Rabb, that he killed Gonzalez with the axe and . beat the man's face and head. He said he then collected one . of his victim's eyes, 'which tasted like an oyster', and some of his . brain matter and consumed them in a nearby cemetery, washing it down . with sake, according to court documents. Smith, at his arraignment in February 2012, had told his cousin that one of his victim's eyes 'tasted like an oyster' When Smith returned to his cousin's house after killing Gonzalez he had blood on his pants and he was carrying chopsticks and a bloody axe . 'Tyree . told his cousin the blows to Gonzalez's head were so severe that he was . able to remove an eye from the man's head along with pieces of brain . matter and a piece of his skull,' the arrest warrant says. Police later recovered the bloody axe and an empty bottle of sake in a stream bed nearby. Less than a month . after the killing, Smith was treated and released from St. Vincent's . Medical Center's Behavioral Health Services in Westport, Connecticut after being . discovered in a pharmacy bleeding from his wrist, which police said he . had slashed with a box cutter. He was eventually discharged and returned to Florida, where he was arrested on Jan. 23, 2012, and charged with murder. The defense's case rested mainly on the testimony of Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Reena Kapoor. She testified that Smith retained his lust for human flesh after his arrest - even offering to eat her. Kapoor claimed that Smith suffered from psychotic incidents since childhood and heard voices that told him to kill people. She . said the voices ordered Smith to eat the victim's brain so they would . get a better understanding of human behavior and the eyes so that they . could see into the 'spirit realm.' After Smith ate the body parts he went to Subway, she said.","Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, hacked homeless man Angel Gonzalez to death and then ate his eye and parts of his brain .

"After a backlash from viewers over their 'inane' Diamond Jubilee river pageant broadcast, the BBC provided solemn and sober coverage befitting the gravitas of the Thanksgiving service in St Paul's today. Huw Edwards anchored the programme and historian Simon Schama provided commentary on a historic day. The Corporation's coverage of the Thames river pageant was described as 'celebrity-driven drivel' as One Show host Matt Baker came in for heavy criticism. 'Respect and knowledge': Huw Edwards leads the coverage of the St Paul's Service from outside Buckingham Palace today . The former Blue Peter presenter, who appeared alongside Sophie Raworth, was described as 'unprepared, ill-informed and patronising' during the coverage on Sunday afternoon. But today viewers said on Twitter that the BBC's coverage was much better - and appropriate for such a historic event. Respected historian Mr Schama provided detailed and in-depth commentary on the historic event as he spoke with Huw Edwards on-screen today. Royal coverage: Fiona Bruce reports on the day's events from outside Westminster on the BBC . Fearne Cotton was today blasted for asking singer Paloma Faith about a Diamond Jubilee sick bag in a live interview. After the BBC were praised for turning their coverage around after Sunday's pageant debacle, the radio presenter quizzed the artist about the bag. And Miss Faith took the chance on the BBC's Diamond Jubilee programme to shamelessly try and promote her new album. Twitter user Grace Willis wrote: 'Love the fact that Paloma Faith just used the words 'vom' and 'cotch' on #bbcjubilee'. And Michael Idato wrote: 'Dear BBC, please find the person who booked Paloma Faith for your #diamondjubilee telecast. And sack them. Immediately.' Newsreaders Fiona Bruce and Sophie . Raworth were among the team of reporters covering the church service led . by the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, by this afternoon it was all . beginning to fall apart again as Fearne Cotton asked Paloma Faith about . Jubilee sick bags in a cringeworthy interview. Fearne Cotton and the BBC's Formula One presenter Jake Humphrey were also involved in the coverage. A . spokesman for the BBC today denied that they had made any changes to . their presenting line-up in light of the criticism they had received. Viewer Natalie Watson wrote on . Twitter: 'At least the BBC have got Huw Edwards doing the commentary . today - a broadcaster showing the respect and knowledge of the event.' Stuart Norris, another viewer, Tweeted: 'Huw Edwards is the king of royal broadcasting'. Matthew Hillman wrote: 'Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce are class acts'. The praise was in stark contrast to Sunday when Stephen Fry led the criticism and accused the BBC of presenting the most 'mind-numbingly tedious programme in its history'. Other . viewers said the show's presenters should have 'shut up' and shown the . boats rather than cutting to seemingly endless interviews and features. Expert analysis: Simon Schama who appeared on screen during the coverage today . The . production team were criticised for cutting away from the flotilla at . key moments, including the opening of Tower Bridge, after producer Ben . Weston, 41, was plucked from relative obscurity to lead four days of . Diamond Jubilee coverage. Mr Weston said he wanted to bring a . ‘lighter touch’ to the coverage of the River Pageant or as viewers have . termed it, ‘dumbing down’. Today he defended Sunday's broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 5 - and said they wanted to bring the pageant to life. He said said: 'We did our best on an extraordinarily technically complicated broadcast in abject difficult weather.' In defending the . editorial decisions he said he had a choice either to just 'point and . shoot' the event or 'try and bring it to life'. He added: 'We . didn't just want to reflect what was happening on the boats and the . beautiful sight of the boats, we wanted to reflect all the colour and . the celebration going on in those parks as well.' The commentary team were accused of not knowing enough about the . individual boats. Poor weather caused a number of technical problems . with the sound cutting out during musical performances.

Despite the problems, an estimated 10.3million people tuned into the coverage - with viewing figures peaking at 11.9million. Countless viewers . took to Twitter to criticise the standard of coverage, with most . complaints focused on the presenting team, and it became one of the most . popular topics on the messaging site. In a series of . Twitter messages, BBC Two presenter Mr Fry said: ‘HRH The Queen, said the first ignorant presenter. HRH? ‘But, dear me, this . is eggier and cheesier than a collapsed souffle. Deeply embarrassing. Everyone is telling me that Sky’s coverage is better. ‘Don’t get me wrong peeps, I’m not saying this in relation to ER II’s jubilee - just expected better of the Beeb.’ ‘It’s because I am an old sentimentalist that I expect better of the nation’s broadcaster.’ Comedian Julian Clary added simply: ‘Please make it stop. #bbcjubilee.' Tory MP for Reading East, Rob Wilson, joined the voices condemning the BBC's jubilee reporting. He wrote: 'Seems we all agree on terrible BBC coverage. Low grade, celebrity driven drivel.

Another damning . posting from the politician read: 'Which is worse, the heavy rain . falling on the flotilla along the Thames or the BBC's dreadful coverage . of this Royal Jubilee event?' Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby, summed up the coverage in similarly disparaging terms. 'One hated Thames . Armada. No Navy left so hordes of tatty boats.

"Think of solar panels and vast ‘fields’ of blue silicon or a patchwork of panels covering a roof probably spring to mind. But now scientists have developed a breakthrough type of solar panel that can be placed directly over a window to harvest the sun’s energy, while remaining completely transparent. The technology could lead to self-sufficient buildings or mobile phone screens that charge handsets when left in sunlight. Scientists say the ‘transparent luminescent solar concentrator’ (pictured) could be used on buildings, mobiles and ‘any other device that has a clear surface. The solar harvesting material  uses specially-developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight and convert it to electricity . Researchers at Michigan State University developed the ‘transparent luminescent solar concentrator’ which they say could be used on buildings, mobiles and ‘any other device that has a clear surface’. For years scientists have tried to produce energy harvested from solar cells made from luminescent plastic-like materials, but the technologies have performed poorly. The energy production was inefficient and the materials were highly coloured. ‘No one wants to sit behind coloured glass,’ said Richard Lunt, an assistant professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the university. The technology used in the transparent material (pictured left) could lead to glass skyscrapers such as London's Shard (pictured right) becoming self-sufficient  buildings covered in solar panels that are still light and airy to live in, or mobile phone screens that charge handsets in the daylight . The solar harvesting material uses specially-developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight. It can be tuned to pick up just the ultraviolet and the near infrared wavelengths that then ‘glow’ at another wavelength in the infrared. The glowing infrared light is guided to the edge of the plastic where it is converted to electricity by thin strips of photovoltaic solar cells. Because the material does not absorb or emit light in the visible spectrum, it looks transparent to the human eye and could therefore be used on next generation phone screens and windows. ‘It makes for a very colourful environment, like working in a disco. We take an approach where we actually make the luminescent active layer itself transparent.’ His solar harvesting material does this by using specially-developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight. ‘We can tune these materials to pick up just the ultraviolet and the near infrared wavelengths that then “glow” at another wavelength in the infrared,’ he said. The glowing infrared light is guided to the edge of the plastic where it is converted to electricity by thin strips of photovoltaic solar cells. Professor Lunt explained: ‘Because the materials do not absorb or emit light in the visible spectrum, they look exceptionally transparent to the human eye.’ He believes that the technology has the potential to be scaled so it could be used cheaply in the next generation of commercial products as well as in industries. ‘It opens a lot of area to deploy solar energy in a non-intrusive way,’ he said. Scientists believe that the technology has the potential to be scaled to be used cheaply in the next generation of commercial products as well as in the building industries. This means that solar panels could look just like windows in houses of the future, instead of being displayed on roof tops (stock image) ‘It can be used on tall buildings with lots of windows or any kind of mobile device that demands high aesthetic quality like a phone or e-reader. ‘Ultimately we want to make solar harvesting surfaces that you do not even know are there.’ Professor Lunt said that more work is needed to improve the efficiency of the material. It currently has a solar conversion efficiency close to 1 percent but could reach five per cent when fully developed. The best coloured luminescent solar concentrator is around seven per cent efficient.","Researchers at Michigan State University developed the transparent panels .

"The smiling model in the advert for the Nivea Vital anti-age cream looked remarkably youthful for her 60-plus years.

The pack stated: ‘Reduces all major signs of . mature skin ageing' and 'Gives mature skin the extra care it deserves'. But an ASA investigation following a complaint found the image was created through computer trickery rather than using the cream. The ASA said the manufacturer, Beiersdorf of Germany, had failed to provide evidence to back up the many claimed effects of using the moisturising cream. In a damning assessement of the ad, . the authority said: ‘We considered that the image of the older model, who was . in the centre of the shot, had undergone extensive retouching resulting . in substantial changes to the model’s appearance. ‘Lines . and wrinkles on her face, particularly around the eye and mouth area, . had been dramatically reduced, and several age spots had been removed. Misleading: A 2010 Advert for Nivea Visage Q10 which was banned by the ASA . ‘In . the absence of evidence demonstrating that that effect was in line with . that which could be achieved through use of the product, we concluded . that the ad misleadingly exaggerated the performance of the product in . relation to the claims ‘anti-age’. A Nivea spokesman said: ‘We regret the fact that this image has been considered misleading, as this was never our intention.’ This was not the first time Nivea has fallen foul of advertising rules. In 2010 the ASA banned a cinema ad for ‘Nivea Visage Anti-Wrinkle Q10 Plus’ for giving the  misleading impression that 37 per cent of women using the cream felt more beautiful than they had when they were ten years younger. Campaign: MP Jo Swinson says excessive airbrushing puts pressure on women to achieve impossible ideals . Other beauty brands have been found guilty of manipulating images to exaggerate their anti-ageing effects. In 2009, a magazine advertisement for Olay Regenerist Definity Eye Illuminator was banned after an image of the model Twiggy, who was 60 at the time, was airbrushed to soften the wrinkles around her eyes. Two years ago, an ad for ‘Teint Miracle’ foundation by the L’Oreal brand Lancôme was criticised by the ASA for manipulating of images of the actress Julia Roberts. It was banned, along with another featuring Christy Turlington for a Maybelline foundation on the grounds of excessive airbrushing. The Lib-Dem MP and Consumer Affairs minister, Jo Swinson, has campaigned against the use of airbrushing in marketing, claiming it puts unfair pressure on women. Before joining the Government, she said: ‘We believe in the freedom of companies to advertise but we also believe in the freedom of women to be as comfortable as possible with their bodies. ‘They shouldn’t constantly feel the need to measure up to a very narrow range of digitally manipulated pictures.’","Advertising Standards Authority says ad uses too much digital airbrushing .

"Disgraced: Anton Casey, pictured with his wife Bernice, caused outrage by sneering at poor people on Facebook . A British banker who caused  outrage by sneering at poor people on Facebook lost his job yesterday, having been forced to flee Singapore with his family. Disgraced Anton Casey, 39, sneaked out of the city state on an economy-class flight to Perth in Australia with a hat pulled down over his face. Hours later his employer, Crossinvest Asia, pointedly used Facebook to announce his departure. Mr Casey, who was accompanied by his wife Bernice, a former Miss Singapore, and their five-year-old son, triggered fury last week by posting a series of insulting Facebook updates that quickly spread around the globe. It led to a campaign to deport him. In one post, the wealth manager, who lived in Singapore for 12 years, complained about experiencing ‘the stench of public transport’ while his Porsche was in the garage. He also described a taxi driver as a ‘retard’ and posted a photograph of his son sitting on a train with the caption: ‘Daddy where is your car and who are all these poor people?’ In a grovelling email yesterday sent from Australia to a Singapore newspaper, the former HSBC  banker described his remarks as ‘the worst mistake of my life’. Mr Casey wrote: ‘I hope the people of Singapore will allow me to volunteer my time and resources to community projects to make amends. ‘I also hope the people of Singapore, my adopted home, will forgive me over time.’ Mr Casey said he had been forced to leave the country because of threats to his family, but insisted: ‘Singapore is our home, and we hope to return.’ Scroll down for video .

The NBC 'Nightly News' journalist revealed that he avoids alcoholic beverages during a question and answer session with viewers and fans on Facebook. He also admitted that he never really 'loved' drinking anyway and some relatives 'have had a rough time' with it in the past, so it was 'easy' to give up.

Williams, 55, from New Canaan, Connecticut, responded: 'Used to/never really loved it/some family members have had a rough time with it...so I figure since I never know when news is gonna break out...and I so often need to drive and/or think straight...its an easy thing to do without!' During the Facebook chat on Wednesday evening, the father of two, whose daughter Allison stars as Marnie Michaels on the U.S. comedy-drama series Girls, answered questions on both his personal and professional life. One of the questions he was asked was: 'What do you think of volunteer fire departments?' Question: Viewer Jack Boler asked him: 'Why don't you drink Brian?'

In response, Williams, who worked as a volunteer firefighter for three years at Middletown Township Fire Department during high school, admitted that he 'misses doing it every day'. He replied: ''They are the backbone of our country. No matter how big or fancy we get, the truth is in most American communities -- outside of our big cities: when you have a fire in your home, it's your neighbors who drop what they are doing, get out of bed and risk their lives to put the fire out.

Brittain Jones: 'What story have you covered in your career has stuck with you the most?'

"Dozens of asylum seekers have been put up in a hotel at a cost to the taxpayer of almost £2,500 a night after facing delays over their right to stay in the UK. The group has been given accommodation at a three-star hotel near Bolton while waiting for the Home Office to decide on whether they can remain in the country. Around 30 people were given taxpayer-funded beds at the Premier Inn in Horwich, which sits opposite the Macron Stadium, home of Bolton Wanderers. Scroll down for video . Around 30 asylum seekers have been given taxpayer-funded accommodation at the Premier Inn in Horwich, near Bolton after encountering delays at the Home Office . The hotel in Greater Manchester is more commonly used by football fans and business people. It comes after it emerged last week that around 150 asylum seekers are being put up at  seaside hotels in Bournemouth. Some 130 asylum seekers were also revealed to be staying at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, close to the Port of Dover. Serco, the company which has a £120m five-year contract to find housing for asylum seeks in the North West, confirmed it had made the booking at the 126-room hotel, where rooms costs up to £79 a night. It is understood the asylum seekers were transferred from their overcrowded accommodation in London at the weekend. The company said the problem arose due to the number of people in the UK looking for asylum, having fled from conflicts and problems around the world. But the move has been criticised, with one Labour MP saying the Border Agency 'really needed to pull its finger out'. Meanwhile, the Taxpayers' Alliance said the use of hotel rooms should be 'a last resort'. Last week, it emerged more than 88 asylum seekers were staying at the three-star Roundhouse Hotel, 10 minutes walk from Bournemouth beach . At least 67 were being accommodated at the three-star Heathlands Hotel in Bournemouth . The bill for the hotels will be picked up by Serco, which is paid a lump-sum to run the service on behalf of the Home Office. Dia Chakravarty's Political Director of the Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'The Government must keep asylum seekers safe and housed, but they can't allow the costs to taxpayers to spiral. 'Hotels are more expensive than almost any other method of housing, so it must only be a last resort.' Julie Hilling, Labour MP for Bolton West, said: 'The Border Agency really needs to pull its finger out and as soon as possible and process these people's applications for asylum. 'They should either agree they are refugees and help them start a new life, or if decided that they are not legitimate, send them back to their country of origin. Serco was awarded its five-year contract after Home Secretary Theresa May outsourced the asylum rehousing service to three separate companies . 'These are people who have had to flee the most incredible situations and all they want is a place of security and to lead a more normal life - you can't do that in a hotel. 'To live your life in a hotel is absolutely appalling. Housing asylum seekers in hotels isn't costing the borough anything. We all pay through our taxes, but we are not paying through our council tax to re-house these people.' Ron Clarke of charity Refugee Action said: 'The reason people are being moved into hotels is not due to an increase in numbers of asylum seekers. It is down to a backlog in Home Office decision making. 'The reality is that private providers have not found enough properties for people to be moved into. This is yet another example of the government's failure to support vulnerable people.' The Home Office provides accommodation and support for asylum seekers in the UK who are assessed as being 'destitute'. Serco - which has been warned against the use of hotels - was awarded the contract for the private housing of asylum seekers  in 2012. A spokesman for the Home Office said it could not divulge the cost of the contract because of 'commercial sensitivity'. But, according to a response to a Freedom of Information request on the Government website, Serco has a total value contract of £121.2m, which runs from June 2012 to May 2017. At the end of 2012, the UK Border Agency (UKBA) replaced 22 separate contracts provided by 13 different suppliers with six contracts to cover the £620m system. These were divided between G4S, Serco and Clearel. The move, spearheaded by Home Secretary Theresa May, was known as the Commercial and Operational Managers Procuring Asylum Support Services (COMPASS) project and was supposed to save public money. But a National Audit Office report in January found that Serco was failing to meet targets on the standard of accommodation and waiting times. It said the company could be asked to pay back up to £4 million to the government for poor performance. Chris Flood, Serco's Contract Director for Compass, said: 'Serco operates the contract to house asylum seekers requiring accommodation in the North West of England. 'Given international events, there are currently more people looking to the UK for asylum, having fled from the many conflicts and problems around the world. 'We are now consulting urgently with Local Authorities and the Home Office to see how people can best be looked after in line with our contract and the Government's statutory duties. 'We fully understand both the challenges that local communities face and how vulnerable these people can be. Our priority is at all times to make sure that they are safe and secure and are treated with dignity and respect.' The Home Office said: 'The UK has a proud history of offering sanctuary to those who need it. 'We have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term measure.' A spokesman for Premier Inn said: 'We do have a number of people staying with us on a very short-term basis through bookings made on behalf of the government. 'However we do not comment on the specific details regarding individual guests.'","Some 30 people given accommodation at three-star Premier Inn near Bolton .

"Quentin Tarantino is known for walking a risky line in dealing with race in his films, and completely flies past it when it comes to the use of violence. His latest film, called Django Unchained, is no different and the setting of the slave-filled American south in the years prior to the Civil War has many crying foul at his use of racial slurs. This is not the first time that Tarantino has been criticized for his use of the n-word, as Spike Lee took issue with its use in the 1997 film Jackie Brown where the controversial director allowed it to be used 38 times. The latest film, which will open on Christmas Day, focuses on the partnership between a former slave who becomes a bounty hunter who enjoys killing white people in his pursuit for his captured wife. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE TRAILER . Django Unchained: Jamie Foxx's character goes from being a slave in a chain gang to a bounty hunter . Scars of slavery: The trailer shows the back of some slaves, which clearly displays the abuse they felt a the hands of their masters in pre-Civil War Texas . A screening of the film on Tuesday led to reviews that warn of extreme violence and excessive cursing. 'Quite naturally, given the historical setting, the N-word gets a heavy workout, by whites and blacks alike. But much more forceful is the cruelty dispensed by the Southern whites, both as punishment and whim,' a review in The Hollywood Reporter says. Among the scarring acts are instances when attack dogs are released on a man, and black fighters are forced to fight to the death in an ornate drawing room simply for the entertainment of a white plantation owner. Trailers for the film make no attempts to veil the violence, as the main character Django, played by Jamie Foxx, is shown to have painful scars on his back to imply that he had a history of being beaten. Adding to the inherent violence is the fact that Foxx pairs up with Christopher Waltz's character of Dr. King Schultz, a German bounty hunter who comes to Texas looking to kill a set of brothers that Django is able to identify. The pair go on a coordinated killing spree looking for the brothers in question, and using their guns and whips as a way of achieving vengeance. Bloodshed in the cotton fields: A clip from the trailer hints at the level of violence depicted throughout . Grim work: The two lead characters partner up as bounty hunters to kill a group of brothers who had wronged someone, and in the process they kill a number of people . At one point, Schultz asks Django if he enjoys his new role as a bounty hunter, and the former slave replies 'Kill white folks and they pay you for it- What's not to like?' Foxx used the same line during his opening monologue while hosting Saturday Night Live last week- as part of the promotion of the film- and brushed off the ensuing criticism saying that he is a comedian and it is meant as a joke. 'Of course there are hot button issues-- the language and violence, and everything like that but the way (the film) landed, I mean when you watch this play in front of an audience, it's amazing,' Foxx said of the film during an appearance on The Today Show. Reunion: Quentin was also reunited with his Pulp Fiction star Samuel L Jackson who arrived at the premiere in a warm woolly hat . Stars of the show: Leonardo and Foxx take on the lead roles in Tarantino's latest film . 'It takes you to those moments that are dark and tough to watch, but (there) are a lot of moments that come from out of nowhere that makes the whole audience bubble up.' The actor has some personal connections to the racial prejudices shown in the film, and during one press event he said that he was frequently faced with the n-word while growing up in Texas. 'Being called a n***** as a young kid by white people was something I had to deal with,' Foxx said. 'Having that done to me I was able to grasp what was going on in the script. When a project becomes magic and special it means that at certain points in the script it parallels your story.' He is not the only prominent African American to have embraced the sensitive material, as the actor said that a number of his friends including Oprah Winfrey have seen the film and, because they came in braced for the typical Tarantino level of violence, they enjoyed it overall.

"LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and several Brooklyn players are wearing 'I Can't Breathe' shirts as they warm up for a game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Nets. Kevin Garnett and Deron Williams were among four Nets wearing the shirts before Monday night's game in support of the family of Eric Garner, who died on July 17 after a police officer placed him in a chokehold when he was being arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Chicago star Derrick Rose wore one before a game Saturday and James said Sunday he wanted one. He got it from Nets guard Jarrett Jack, who provided them to players on both teams. LeBron James warmed up at the Barclays Center wearing a 'I can't breathe' shirt . James joined some of his fellow US sport stars to show support for Eric Garner, who was choked to death . A few NFL players had the saying written on different items of gear and shirts during pregame warmups before games on Sunday, including St. Louis Rams guard Davin Joseph, Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush and Cleveland Browns cornerback Johnson Bademosi. 'Obviously as a society we have to do better, we have to have empathy better for one another no matter what race you are, but it's more a shout-out to the family more than anything,' James said before warming up. Irving had already gone to the court in his shirt as James spoke. James said at the time it was a 'possibility' he would do the same, and he was wearing the shirt when he unzipped his yellow and gray jacket in Cleveland's layup line. James is introduced at the Barclays Center for Cleveland's game against the Brooklyn Nets . Kyrie Irving, LeBron's Cleveland Cavaliers team-mate, also wore the shirt before the game . The statement from the players came before a game that was to be attended by Britain's Prince William and his wife, Kate, as well as NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. 'I respect Derrick Rose and all of our players for voicing their personal views on important issues but my preference would be for players to abide by our on-court attire rules,' Silver said.

A recording of Garner's arrest showed him gasping, 'I can't breathe' during the fatal encounter, and thousands have protested a grand jury decision not to indict the officer since the announcement on Wednesday. Irving also said his thoughts were with Garner's family.

"A father who spent 21 years on death row for murdering a schoolgirl while trying to steal her earrings could soon be free after a federal judge overturned his conviction, claiming police 'covered up evidence.' Senior U.S. District Judge Anita Brody called the case against James Dennis 'a grave miscarriage of justice' and said 'improper police work' led to the now-42-year-old being unfairly locked up for two decades. In a ruling on Wednesday, she ordered Dennis released from prison unless prosecutors retry him within six months. Scroll down for video . Music: Dennis, pictured in his late teens, was an aspiring singer when he went to prison . 'When I first heard it, I couldn't . believe it. When the lawyer called, I was on my feet. I was dancing. I . was giving God the praise, because this is something we have been . praying for from day one,' said Dennis' mother, Juanita Dennis, told ABC . News. Brody . said Dennis was convicted based on 'shaky eyewitness identifications' following the shooting of Chedell Williams, 17, at a transit stop in . Philadelphia's Fern Rock section in October 1991. But . other witnesses described Williams' killer as much taller than Dennis, . who is 5-foot-5, and weighed more, according to the ruling. Injustice: Judge Anita Brody called the case against James Dennis, pictured left and right, 'a grave miscarriage of justice' and said 'improper police work' led to the now-42-year-old being locked up for so long . Williams was at the train station . with a female friend. Witnesses told police that at least two men were . involved in the shooting, and possibly a third as a getaway driver, but . Dennis was the only person charged. The men demanded her $450 earrings, and she handed them over, but they shot her anyway. The weapon used in the shooting and the earrings were never recovered and police found no forensic evidence against Dennis. Williams' friend told relatives that she knew the two assailants from high school and knew their nicknames, however she had never seen the men shown to her in the line up. The relatives passed the information to police, but they never followed up on it, Brody found. Happy: Dennis' mother, daughters and other family, pictured, are thrilled at the overturned sentence . 'Improper police work characterized nearly the entirety of the investigation,' the judge said, according to NBC News. Dennis, who was 20 and had only a minor drug arrest on his record when he was charged in Williams' death, maintains that he was on a bus at the time of the shooting and offered up an acquaintance to corroborate his story but he was convicted in 1992. 'The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania covered up evidence that pointed away from Dennis,' Brody added. '(It) has committed a grave miscarriage of justice in convicting Dennis and sentencing him to die for this crime.' The judge also questioned the . identification techniques used during a police photo array and police . lineup, which have come under fire in numerous cases from the time. He was already a father and had a child born after he went to prison. Police ID: The judge also questioned the identification techniques used during a police photo array and police lineup, which led to Dennis, pictured left and right, being pinpointed . 'For him, as a father, for him to have been accused of this horrible crime has really taken a toll on him,' pro bono lawyer Ryan Guilds, who has worked on his appeal since 1999, told NBC. However, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said he was disgusted by the judge's decision and his office was reviewing their options. 'The defendant was convicted for the brutal murder of a teenage girl on her way home from school, in broad daylight,' Williams told NBC. 'Three passersby saw him do it and identified him in court, without any possible motive to lie.' Dennis, who is now a grandfather, hopes to be reunited with his family as soon as possible.","Senior U.S. District Judge Anita Brody called the case against Philadelphia man James Dennis 'a grave miscarriage of justice' and blamed 'improper police work'

"People who are friendly and open are typically more concerned about topics such as the environment, scientists have claimed/ . And now new research has shown that if enough people in a country have these traits, it can determine the ‘personality’ of an entire nation. In turn, this directly impacts on how environmentally-friendly that country is, and the measures it takes to protect and improve the planet. Researchers from the University of Toronto compared Environmental Performance Index (EPI) ratings for 46 countries to nation-level personality traits. It discovered that countries which scored high for agreeableness (pictured) had higher EPI ratings, and were therefore more environmentally-sustainable. Switzerland was the most agreeable, open and environmentally-friendly country . ‘We used to think that personality only mattered for individual outcomes,’ said Professor Hirsh from the University of Toronto Mississauga’s Institute for Management and Innovation, ‘But we’re finding that population differences in personality characteristics have many large-scale consequences’. Professor Hirsh’s previous work looked at how personality traits predict an individual’s attitudes about the environment. The Environmental Health Index (EPI), developed at Yale and Columbia Universities, ranks countries across 20 environmental fctors, including CO2 emission levels, use of renewable energy, and air quality. The two objectives of the index are Environmental Health and Ecosystem Vitality. Environmental Health measures the 'protection of human health from environmental harm'. While Ecosystem Vitality measures 'ecosystem protection and resource management'. These two objectives are further divided into nine categories that cover issues, including air quality, forests, fisheries, and climate and energy, among others. Underlying the nine issue categories are 20 indicators based on data and statistics taken from the records of individual countries. His latest study takes this research a step further, examining how those traits play out across whole nations. The study examined nation-level personality traits from a database of 12,156 people in 46 countries. National personality differences, reflecting average trait profiles of a country’s residents, were t5hen used to predict scores on the Environmental Performance Index (EPI). The EPI, developed at Yale and Columbia Universities, ranks countries across 20 environmental indicators, including CO2 emission levels, use of renewable energy, and air quality. Higher scores on the EPI, reflecting more environmentally sustainable policies and practices, directly correlated with national levels of two personality traits. Namely agreeableness, which reflects empathy and compassion, and openness, which suggests 'cognitive flexibility' and the appreciation of objects and ideas. The countries featured in the study included Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia ,Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, ,Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom and the US. Switzerland topped both the agreeableness and openness charts, and was also the highest ranking country on the EPI. At the bottom end of the scale for agreeableness were Morocco and Nigeria, which rank 81st and 134th from the list 178 countries ranked on EPI. Germany, the UK and Denmark were high scorers on the openness scale and ranked 6th, 12th and 13th respectively for EPI. These results highlight the psychological factors that can shape a nation’s environmental policies, said Professor Hirsh. ‘Not only can a person’s attitudes about the environment be predicted from his or her personality traits, but the environmental practices of entire nations can be predicted from the personality profiles of their citizens’. The Environmental Health Index (EPI), developed at Yale and Columbia Universities, ranks countries across 20 environmental indicators (pictured) including CO2 emission levels, use of renewable energy, and air quality . The study examined nation-level personality traits from a database of 12,156 people in 46 countries.  Germany, the UK and Denmark were high scorers on the openness scale and ranked 6th, 12th and 13th on the EPI respectively . ‘Previous research has linked higher levels of the personality traits agreeableness and openness with greater concern about environmental issues,’ explained the researchers. ‘While these traits are important predictors of environmental attitudes among individuals, a growing literature has begun examining the broader consequences of population differences in personality characteristics. ‘The present study examines whether nationally aggregated personality traits can be significant predictors of a country’s environmental sustainability. ‘Just as agreeableness and openness predict environmental concern at the individual level, countries with higher population levels of agreeableness and openness had significantly better performance on the sustainability index. The paper was published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology.","Researchers compared Environmental Performance Index (EPI) ratings to nation-level personality traits .

"Scientists have released high quality images of the brain that they claim will have a ‘major impact’ on our understanding of the organ. Following a five year project involving more than 100 researchers from ten institutions, the experts have released the data that they hope will enable the exploration of the relationships between brain circuits and an individual's behaviour. The Human Connectome Project, which involves scientists across Europe and the USA, aims to collect data using advanced brain imaging methods, and to make the data freely available so that scientists worldwide can make further discoveries about brain circuitry. Scroll down for video . A map of average 'functional connectivity' in human cerebral cortex . An MRI scan of the brain at rest. The areas in yellow are those that are strongly linked to the area with the blue dot . The initial data release includes brain imaging scans plus behavioural information — individual differences in personality, cognitive capabilities, emotional characteristics and perceptual function — obtained from 68 healthy adult volunteers. It is particularly notable because the new data is of much higher resolution, and is therefore more detailed, than data obtained by conventional brain scans. Over the next few years the number of people studied will increase until the researchers reach their final target of 1,200. The Human Connectome Project consortium is led by Dr David Van Essen, Alumni Endowed Professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. One of the 'connection maps' created by the team, which shows pathways in the brain of volunteers . The project will publish all of its data online and make it accessible for researchers . He said: ‘By making this unique data set available now, and continuing with regular data releases every  quarter, the Human Connectome Project is enabling the scientific community to immediately begin exploring relationships between brain circuits and individual behaviour. ‘The HCP will have a major impact on our understanding of the healthy adult human brain, and it will set the stage for future projects that examine changes in brain circuits underlying the wide variety of brain disorders afflicting humankind.’ A composite of the scans of 20 individuals. Regions in yellow and red are linked to the parietal lobe of the brain's right hemisphere . Yellow and red regions are activated by a task involving listening to stories, whereas green and blue regions are more strongly activated by a task involving arithmetic calculations . The data set includes information about brain connectivity in each individual, using two distinct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches. One is based on spontaneous fluctuations in functional MRI signals that occur in a complex pattern in space and time throughout the gray matter of the brain. Another, called diffusion imaging, provides information about the long-distance ‘wiring’ – the anatomical pathways traversing the brain’s white matter. Brain activations in the brain's grey matter. Yellow and red regions are activated when subjects view human faces . Each subject was also scanned while performing a variety of tasks within the scanner, thereby providing extensive information about brain activation patterns. Behavioural data using a variety of tests performed outside the scanner are being released along with the scan data for each subject. The subjects are drawn from families that include siblings, some of whom are twins. This will enable studies of the heritability of brain circuits. Dr Daniel Marcus, assistant professor of radiology and director of the Neuroinformatics Research Group at Washington University School of Medicine, said: ‘The Human Connectome Project represents a major advance in sharing brain imaging data in ways that will accelerate the pace of discovery about the human brain in health and disease.’","The Human Connectome Project released high quality images of the brain .

Allegations: Sylvester Stallone, left, secretly agreed a multi-million deal with his late half-sister Toni-Ann Filiti  amid claims he had abused her for years . Sibling: Toni-Ann Filiti, half-sister of actor Sylvester Stallone, is pictured in exercise clothes in New York in 1985 . But it has now emerged according to . confidential settlement documents, dated Aug. 3, 1987,  tapes were also destroyed which . allegedly contained conversations between the pair.

'This is to acknowledge receipt from . you of a total of six cassette tapes, four of which contain . conversations between you and your older half-brother who we are . referring to as S.,' reads a letter made to Filiti by her attorneys. 'You understand that in accordance with the terms of the . settlement agreement between you and S., I and your father are required . to destroy all tapes.' Claims: Stallone's half-sister Toni Ann Filiti with their mother Jackie, seen here at the actor's 2006 Rocky Balboa premiere with her son . As part of the deal he also set up a . trust fund for her, paying in £31,000 a year to cover medical expenses . and psychiatric care, according to newly discovered court papers. Miss Filiti died last August at the . age of 48 after a long battle with lung cancer. In total, she received . more than £3million from the settlement. Stallone’s mother Jackie, 91, . confirmed the actor had reached a financial settlement with her – but . described it as a ‘shakedown’. She said Miss Filiti, her daughter by . her second husband, was a drug addict who blackmailed Stallone when he . was at the height of his fame, in 1987. Miss Filiti, then 23, threatened him . with a lawsuit alleging abuse. According to court papers obtained by a . New York newspaper, she ‘asserted claims for personal injury, including . physical injury’ against Stallone. The papers show that the actor, now 66, ‘vigorously denied and continues to deny and dispute all claims of wrongdoing’. Nevertheless, Stallone’s mother said his lawyers advised him to pay up to avoid any scandal that could have harmed his career.

His mother had re-married after her first marriage, to . Stallone’s father Frank, ended in divorce after nine years. Despite Miss Filiti’s allegations, . Stallone remained on good terms with his sister. He even cast her son . Edd in his 1997 film Copland – but this week the 19-year-old maintained . that his mother was telling the truth. ‘They’ve made my mother out to be the . black sheep,’ he said. He alleged that his mother ‘screamed about’ abuse . at the hands of her brother ‘over and over’ while in a Florida hospital . last year. A spokesman for Stallone said: . ‘Unfortunately, celebrities, politicians and athletes frequently find . themselves the targets of blackmail efforts by family members and . associates who fabricate claims in order to extort payments from them.’ Clan: The action star and his former model wife Jennifer Flavin, 43, have three daughters together, Sophia Rose 15, Sistine Rose 13 and Scarlet Rose nine .

"Loom bands have already taken the celebrity world by storm, and now the bracelets made popular by the likes of David Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge are the subject of a record attempt. Pupils at St Joseph’s and St Teresa’s School in Wells, Somerset have created an incredible 650 foot long chain containing 60,000 loom bands. Now they are hoping to break the world record the longest loom band chain - although they still have some way to go to beat the 29,040 foot chain created in California earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Achievement: Pupils at St Joseph's and St Teresa's School in Wells, Somerset have created an incredible 650 foot long chain containing 60,000 loom bands. They are hoping to break the world record . Having a ball: The pupils came up with the record breaking challenge after they - like so many other schoolchildren around the country - became obsessed with the loom band craze . Trend: Loom bands have already taken the celebrity world by storm, finding fans in the likes of the Duchess of Cambridge (left), former footballer David Beckham (right) and the Duchess of Cornwall . Pupils at St Joseph’s and St Teresa’s came up with the challenge after they - like so many other schoolchildren around the country - became obsessed with the craze. It sees youngsters link dozens of tiny, brightly coloured rubber bands together to create a bracelet. Although loom bands were invented by an American engineer in 2011, they really took off when a number of celebrities were spotted wearing the bracelets earlier this year. Now the St Joseph’s and St Teresa’s pupils are taking the craze to its logical, record-breaking conclusion. 'It started off with a girl in my class, . she started coming in with bands, then we said we came up with the idea . we should try and break the world record attempt,' said 10-year-old John Doyle. 'Then everyone in school joined in. I think there are 300 bands in a metre so it’s a lot of bands, but everyone is doing it,' he added. 'It is a lot of money, it’s cost me about £7 so far, I save up my pocket money and use that to buy them,' John went on to say. Popular: Although loom bands were invented by an American engineer in 2011, they really took off in schools when a number of celebrities were spotted wearing the bracelets earlier this year . Ambition: So many pupils at the school started collecting loom bands that they had the idea to link them into one giant chain in the hope of one day breaking the world record . Pastime: The loom band craze involves linking dozens of tiny rubber bands together to create a bracelet . The Duchess of Cambridge is just one celebrity known to sport a loom band. She was spotted wearing a multi-colour bracelet - given to her as a gift by a little girl - during a royal tour of New Zealand earlier this year. A few months after the Duchess was seen wearing the band, her parents Carole and Michael Middleton began selling a similar product through their mail-order company Party Pieces. Sales of loom bands have since rocketed by more than 300 per cent and they're now as much a fashion statement as they are a children's fad. Other well-known figures seen wearing them include former footballer David Beckham and One Direction's Harry Styles. Although loom bands have won the  celebrity seal of approval, school children are the real driving force behind the brightly-coloured bracelets' popularity. Ask anyone with children and they'll likely confirm Britain has gone loom band crazy in the months since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one. John's eight-year-old friend Summer Ansell said she has been making loom bands for the last three months and still really enjoys making the bracelets. 'One day we will get the record. It will take a long while though,' she said. 'I enjoy making them, if you try as hard as you can you will achieve whatever you want to achieve,' she added. Summer said she had heard older people at her school were attempting to break the world record, so asked if she could join in too. 'All my friends have joined in. They don’t mind at all - girls and boys. But girls are much better at making them,' she said. Headteacher . Angela Nolan said she first noticed the children making the bracelets . two months ago - with the pastime quickly taking over the school. But . it was not until a few weeks later when she was walking through the . playground that she saw the pupils coming together to link the bands . into one giant creation. 'One morning I went out on the playground and I noticed they had started to put together longer chains,' she said. 'I . asked them what they were trying to do and they said they wanted to . break the world record for the longest chain. This was all at 8.45 in . the morning,' she added. Some way to go: Although there is not yet an official Guinness World Record, 500 people in Tustin, California built a 29,040 foot chain to raise money for a cancer sufferer in March this year . Getting involved: Headteacher Angela Nolan said she first noticed the children making the bracelets two months ago - with the pastime quickly taking over the school. She says the challenge shows great team work . Ms Nolan said she was 'really surprised and really pleased' that the pupils were working together and had themselves such a lofty goal. 'They really believe that they absolutely can achieve anything they want,' she said. The children have a long way to go before setting a record, however. Although there is not yet an official Guinness World Record, 500 people in Tustin, California built a 29,040ft chain in March this year. Their creation was part of fundraising attempt to raise money for a seven-year-old who was battling brain cancer.","Pupils at school in Somerset built chain in hope of breaking world record .

"Once upon a time, wearing a barely-there dress required the careful application of sticky tape – and about as much confidence as a  Hollywood actress. But the secret behind celebrities’ barely-there frocks has been revealed. And it is the ‘InvisiBra’ keeping the stars’ dignity intact, with silicone cups that stick to the skin. Racy in Red: Emma Watson dares to bare at this years' Golden Globes . Yesterday it emerged that the strapless self-adhesive bra is rapidly becoming the must-have item in celebrity wardrobes, while high-street alternatives have also begun to emerge as the trend for back-less and side-less has filtered down from the catwalk. . Miss Paltrow, who attended a premiere last year wearing a frock with full-length sheer panels on either side, is thought to have worn an InvisiBra or similar. So too has Harry Potter actress Miss Watson, who wore an entirely backless dress to the Golden Globes – adding a pair of leggings so as to retain some degree of dignity. Black Swan actress Natalie Portman and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell are also believed to have invested in such bras. The InvisiBra will no doubt come as a welcome development in underwear technology to anyone who has battled with self-adhesive tape in the past. So-called ‘tit-tape’ was at one time the only option to avoid unsightly straps being seen when wearing a delicate dress, while others may have braved going braless altogether, risking embarrassment should fabric shift out of place. Actress Anne Hathaway exposes her back at the 'Les Miserables' film premiere in London . The InvisiBra, which was created by a lingerie company called Lavalia, is the first to do away with straps and backs altogether. Made from either silicone - £48 – or fabric - £38 – the bras, look like two cups joined together with a tiny clasp. They were designed in response to demand from brides-to-be wanting to wear strap or back-less dresses on their wedding days. And according to a Lavalia spokesperson demand has soared since they were first launched in London last summer and there has been a 30 per cent rise month-on-month from December to January with 70 now sold a day. ‘January has been a fantastic month for InvisiBra, we’ve been selling around 70 bras a day. This could be as it is award season and women, who regularly see gowns in the media that are perfect for wearing an InvisiBra with, have been looking for ways to wear similar dresses without risking their dignity. ‘Celebrities love the InvisiBra because it’s so versatile and it enables them to wear any style of top or dress without fear of it slipping off and exposing too much. Many of the celebrities who have suffered embarrassing nip-slips recently could have saved their blushes by investing in an InvisiBra.’ Although the InvisBra is only sold online, similar bras have found their way on to the high street with Debenhams and Marks and Spencer stocking similar self-adhesive items. Last night Marks and Spencer reported a rise in sales of its Strapless Stick On Adhesive Bra, which is almost identical to the InvisiBra but has a sheer silicone band that wraps around the torso to help support the cups. While in Debenhams, the brand’s Natural Stick On Bra is attached to the skin with sticky taps on either side of the cups.","InvisiBra works by using silicone cups that stick to the skin .

"Virgin CEO Richard Branson has been accused of attempting to distance himself and his company from the tragic accident in which a pilot was killed during a test flight of Virgin Galactic’s prototype space tourism rocket. SpaceShipTwo crashed after suffering 'a serious anomaly' in the Mojave desert on Friday. Pilot Peter Siebold, 43, was able to parachute to safety, but co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury, 39, was killed. Branson spoke to the media from the crash site on Saturday, but one prominent blogger has  criticized the billionaire after he denied knowing one of the pilots involved and made a point of repeatedly describing them as employees of Scaled Composites, the company developing the spaceship for Virgin Galactic. Scroll down for video . Billionaire Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson has been accused of attempting to distance himself from Friday’s tragic accident in which a pilot was killed during a test flight of a prototype rocket . Blogger Douglas Messier has quoted unnamed sources as describing Branson as ‘outrageous’ and accused him of trying to put the entire blame for the crash on Scaled Composites, who developed the spaceship for Virgin Galactic . A journalist reporting from the Mojave Air and Space Port has quoted unnamed sources as describing Branson as ‘outrageous’ and accused Branson of trying to put the entire blame for the crash on Scaled Composites. ‘Sources have called Branson's decision to try to put entire responsibility for doomed flight on Scaled Composites as outrageous,' tweeted Douglas Messier, who’s Parabolic Arc website reports on space tourism. Messier, who witnessed Friday’s crash, also tweeted that while it was technically true that Scaled Composites had conducted Friday's flight test ‘previous flight tests [had been] billed as joint Virgin and Scaled efforts. ‘Now that it blew up, the responsibility is Scaled alone,’ he tweeted. Past meeting: Branson said on Saturday that he had never met Alsbury, second left, even though the two can be seen talking and celebrating in this footage following a flight in April 2013 . In a flurry of tweets, Messier said that while it was technically true that Scaled Composites had conducted Friday's flight test ‘previous flight tests [had been] billed as joint Virgin and Scaled efforts' A video of SpaceShipTwo's first rocket-powered test flight from last year, available on YouTube, shows Branson posing for photographs with Alsbury, second right . Messier also took Branson to task over his initial denial that he did not know the pilots when a video of SpaceShipTwo's first rocket-powered test flight from last year, available on YouTube, showed him posing for photographs with Alsbury. 'Suddenly they are Scaled pilots who Branson denies knowing' tweeted Messier, who also claimed that Virgin had exerted a lot of pressure on Scaled Composites to fly with the new engine. When asked on Saturday if he had ever met Alsbury, Branson said: ‘The pilot worked for Scaled and not for Virgin Galactic and I've actually, I haven't, I have never met him.’ In a blog post on Sunday he changed his response saying he was sad not to have known the 39-year-old. ‘Sadly, I did not know him - because he worked for Scaled Composites - but I had had the privilege of shaking his hand briefly after he'd co-piloted SpaceShipTwo's first powered flight and on that exciting morning in Mojave I had congratulated him on the achievement.’ In a blog post on Sunday, Sir Richard Branson said he was sad not to have known 39-year-old Michael Alsbury (above) who died in Friday's explosion . These images show the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket separating from the carrier aircraft, left, prior to it exploding in the air, right, during a test flight on Friday . In the three-minute film Sir Richard introduces footage of SpaceShip Two reaching supersonic speed for the first time, also in Mojave, and is then seen applauding the successful test flight. Writing on Sunday Sir Richard added: ‘Mike was an accomplished test pilot and had worked for Scaled Composites for 13 years. ‘Beyond his skills as a pilot - including 1600 hours of flight time in research aircraft built by his colleagues at Scaled - Mike was a dear friend and inspiring colleague to the many many friends he left behind. ‘My heart goes out to his parents, his wife and children, his sister and the rest of his family and friends.’ Of injured pilot Peter Siebold, 43, Sir Richard said: ‘I do have the privilege of knowing Pete Siebold, Scaled's injured test pilot. Pete is Scaled's director of flight operations and among the incredibly dedicated and talented team helping to realize so many people's dreams of reaching space. We all wish him a speedy recovery.’ Branson has also been criticized by Time magazine. 'But it’s hard too not to be angry, even disgusted, with Branson himself,' writes Jeffrey Kluger in an editorial piece. 'He is, as today’s tragedy shows, a man driven by too much hubris, too much hucksterism and too little knowledge of the head-crackingly complex business of engineering.' Mail Online has reached out to Virgin Galactic for comment on Messier's tweets. In the three-minute film Sir Richard introduces footage of SpaceShip Two reaching supersonic speed for the first time in April 2013  and is then seen applauding Alsbury . Branson has promised to find out what caused the crash of his Virgin Galactic prototype space tourism rocket that killed a test pilot, but federal investigators are cautioning that it may take up to a year to learn exactly what went wrong. The crash in the California desert has almost certainly dashed Branson's goal of starting suborbital flight next spring, but the mogul said that while he remained committed to civilian space travel ‘we are not going to push on blindly.’ ‘Yesterday, we fell short,’ said Branson on Saturday at the Mojave Air and Space Port. ‘We'll now comprehensively assess the results of the crash and are determined to learn from this and move forward.’ He asserted that safety has always been the top priority of the program that envisions taking wealthy tourists six at a time to the edge of space for a brief experience of weightlessness and a view of Earth below. Scaled Composite said Alsbury was the co-pilot for the test flight. Siebold, who was piloting SpaceShipTwo, ‘is alert and talking with his family and doctors,’ the company said in a statement. A former colleague said Alsbury was a ‘home-schooled, home-brewed’ pilot who earned his way up through the ranks at the company, starting as an engineer. Alsbury had also put himself through commercial pilot school and was certified as a flight instructor. ‘Mike loved what he did. I think his career ended with him doing exactly that. ... That yesterday ended up in a tragedy was kind of heart-breaking for many of us,’ said Brian Binnie, another test pilot who worked at Scaled Composites for 14 years before leaving the company this year. The crash in the California desert has almost certainly dashed Branson's goal of starting suborbital flight next spring, but the mogul said that while he remained committed to civilian space travel 'we are not going to push on blindly' Staff of Virgin Galactic stand guard outside the company's facilities at Mojave Air and Space Port after Friday's crash . National Transportation Safety Board Acting Chairman Christopher A. Hart said investigators don't yet know how Siebold got out of the rocket ship because they haven't had a chance to interview him. He said they found an undeployed parachute at the crash site, . He said a 5-mile path of debris over an area of uninhabited desert indicates the spacecraft broke up in flight. Learning where spacecraft parts fell will help investigators determine when and how the breakup occurred. ‘This will be the first time we have been in the lead of a space launch (accident) that involved persons onboard,’ said Hart, noting that the NTSB did participate in investigations of the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters. Hart said test flights are usually well-documented. Investigators will review video from multiple cameras that were on the spaceship, on the mother ship, on a chase aircraft and at nearby Edwards Air Force Base. They also have six ‘nonvolatile’ sources of information from the aircraft, and radar data to sift through, he said. The investigation could take up to 12 months to complete, he said. A tank, part of wreckage lies near the site where a Virgin Galactic space tourism rocket, SpaceShipTwo, exploded and crashed in Mojave, California, on Friday . Billionaire Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson, left, and George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic, comment on the crash of their prototype space tourism rocket, that killed one crew member and injured another during Saturday's news conference . Virgin Galactic - owned by Branson's Virgin Group and Aabar Investments PJS of Abu Dhabi - plans to fly passengers to altitudes more than 62 miles above Earth. The company sells seats on each prospective journey for $250,000. The company says that ‘future astronauts,’ as it calls customers, include Stephen Hawking, Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher and Russell Brand. The company reports receiving $90 million from about 700 prospective passengers. On Saturday, Branson said none of that money has been spent and that anyone who wanted a refund could get it. However, he said, no one has asked, and instead someone signed up on the day of the accident in a show of support. At 60 feet long, SpaceShipTwo featured two large windows for each of up to six passengers, one on the side and one overhead. Branson once envisioned operating flights by 2007. Last month, he talked about the first flight being next spring with his son. Friday's flight marked the 55th for SpaceShipTwo, which was intended to be the first of a fleet of craft. This was only the fourth flight to include a brief rocket firing. The rocket fires after the spacecraft is released from the underside of a larger carrying plane. During other flights, the craft either was not released from its mother ship or functioned as a glider after release. The spacecraft broke up after being released from a carrier aircraft at high altitude, according to Ken Brown, a photographer who witnessed the accident. SpaceShipTwo is based on aerospace design maverick Burt Rutan's award-winning SpaceShipOne prototype, which became the first privately financed manned rocket to reach space in 2004. Three people died in a blast at the Mojave Air and Space Port in 2007 while testing a rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo.","Billionaire has been accused of attempting to distance himself  from Friday's tragic accident in which a pilot was killed during a test flight .
Labeled 'outrageous' over denial that he had ever met the dead pilot and repeatedly referred to both pilots as employees of Scaled Composites .
'Previous flight tests [had been] billed as joint Virgin and Scaled efforts. Now that it blew up, the responsibility is Scaled alone,' tweeted Douglas Messier .

"Ever since his death in 1977, the idea that Elvis Presley might still be with us has become a favourite with conspiracy theorists. But it seems that the Elvis superfans might get the last laugh, thanks to a Canadian dentist who believes he can clone the King using DNA sequenced from a tooth. And Dr Michael Zuk doesn't plan to stop at Presley. Dr Zuk also owns a tooth that once belonged to Beatles singer John Lennon and claims that a Lennon clone could be walking the planet as early as 2040. Resurrection: Dr Michael Zuk bought one of John Lennon's teeth at auction and plans to clone the singer . The King is back: Dr Zuk also hopes to bring Elvis Presley back to life using DNA from his teeth . Speaking to cosmetic dentistry comparison site, Teethwise, Dr Zuk revealed the same process used to clone Dolly the Sheep in 1996 could also be used to bring Lennon and Presley back to life. 'Legally, it is not a problem,' he added. 'If . something is illegal in one country its a matter of crossing a border. 'Animal cloning still has some glitches they are working out but they are . already cloning species. Once the glitches are worked out humans will . follow. 'There are people in history that everyone is fixated over…JFK, . Martin Luther King, Marilyn…it will be possible…and because of this, . like the nuclear bomb, it will be happen.' Dr Zuk's mission began two years ago when he bought one of John Lennon's teeth for £19,500 at auction. The tooth had been given to Lennon's housekeeper, Dot Jarlett in the 1960s, before being passed onto her son who later auctioned the memento. 'I saw online that it was for sale and . bought it,' explains Dr Zuk. 'I think collecting celebrity DNA will be insane in the future . as it creates a risk for celebs to have surprise offspring.' He now expects to have a cloned Lennon on his hands by 2040, the year that would have marked his 100th birthday, but, surprisingly, thinks that Lennon 2.0 might not enjoy quite the same level of musical success as the original. '""John"" would be cloned from his DNA which creates the body and hardware for the brain,' reveals the dentist. 'What goes on in his brain would be . largely be down to his environment. John’s personality and cultural . tastes were formed from his upbringing in 40s and 50s Liverpool so this . would obviously be different. Even during his lifetime his musical style . changed.' He added: 'The . musical ability in his DNA is undoubted so we would aim to create an . environment for the child where this ability would be nurtured and . allowed to develop.' Pioneering: Scotland's Dolly the Sheep became the world's first cloned mammal when she was born in 1996 . Despite being sanguine about the ethical minefield that would need to be navigated before bringing the pair of singing superstars back to life, Dr Zuk does admit to qualms about how the cloned Presley and Lennon would cope with the media attention that would inevitably ensue. 'it could be a little unfair,' he says, before adding: 'Whilst some elements of the cloning process would be publicised, it is likely the identity of the child would not initially be disclosed publicly.' Until, of course, a spectacular talent for music and a taste for the limelight began to appear...","Dr Michael Zuk bought one of John Lennon's teeth for £19,500 in 2011 .

"China has the highest amount of atheists living in a single country with nearly 50 per cent of its population describing themselves as non-believers, a new survey has revealed. Around 47 per cent of people living in China describe themselves as atheists compared to an average of 13 per cent across the world. A 2012 poll by WIN/Gallup . International surveyed more than 50,000 people across 40 . countries whether they considered themselves 'religious', 'not . religious' or 'convinced atheist'. Survey: This map shows the percentage of people in different countries around the world who believe themselves to be atheists . It is perhaps not surprising that China has the highest amount of atheists as its republic government was officially atheist when it formed in 1949. All temples temples and religious relics were destroyed during the . Cultural Revolution of 1967 to 1977 . But the country did relax its religious policy with the 1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China guaranteeing 'freedom of religion' in Article 36. Growing followers: But Pope Francis has nothing to worry about as the numbers of people calling themselves in Italy has increased since 2005 . The policy regarding religious practice . in China states that 'no state organ, public organization or individual . may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; . nor may they discriminate against citizens because they do, or do not . believe in religion.' Since the mid-1980s there has been a massive program to rebuild Buddhist and Taoist temples. In recent times, the government has expressed support for Buddhism and Taoism, organizing the World Buddhist Forum in 2006 and the International Forum on the Daodejing in 2007. The government sees these religions as an integral part of Chinese culture. There are five religions recognized by the state, namely Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism. But these figures appear to suggest that much of the skepticism surrounding organized religion in the country has survived. Whereas in Japan, where a post-WWII taboo still remains, with 31 per cent still atheists. One of the most surprising figures in the Islamic country of Saudi Arabia where five per cent of the population described themselves as atheists, despite this being considered a crime. This compares to just one per cent in both Iraq and Afghanistan who describe themselves as atheists. And in Italy, the home of the Catholic Church, support is still strong with nearly three-fourths of Italians consider themselves . religious, which is actually up on 2005's figures. Earlier this week Pope Francis has said atheists who are good are redeemed by Jesus in a homily urging that people of differing beliefs work together. WIN/Gallup notes that religion is strongest among the poor and the less educated, . which correlates among the most religious countries. In Ghana, Nigeria, Armenia and Fiji, more than nine in 10 people say they’re religious.","Gallup .

"Gus Poyet was left to round on referee Kevin Friend and the media after a dismal performance at Bradford followed hot on the heels of Tuesday night's Premier League capitulation against QPR.

Poyet even took issue with a question about the absence of Jermain Defoe, responding: 'You need to know too many things and we try not to give you too much information. 'He was injured, he got a little problem on his calf and we don't know how long it is going to take.'

"Train drivers are planning a three-day strike during the Olympics in a move bound to cause chaos to those travelling to the Games. Members of the Aslef union on East Midlands Trains will take industrial action over pensions on August 6, 7 and 8, when a number of athletics finals will be held in the Olympic Stadium. The news comes as the Public and Commercial Services Union announced thousands of Home Office workers, including Border Agency staff, are to strike on July 26 and take other forms of action until August 20 in a row over jobs, pay and other issues. David Cameron denounced the proposed strikes during London 2012 as not justifiable or right. Scroll down for full Olympic event schedule .

Meanwhile, the train company, . owned by transport giant Stagecoach, said the public will be 'shocked . and angry' that strikes are being planned at a time of 'great national . pride' for the country. The company operates five fast trains to . and from London every hour with connections between the capital and . Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester. David Horne, managing director of . East Midlands Trains, said: 'This is yet another example of Aslef . playing games and is a real kick in the teeth for our customers and the . country. 'The fact is that there was only one . point of clarification still under discussion with the union on the . pension proposal we put forward back in June. 'We were in talks with Aslef to deal with this issue when we heard the news that further strike action dates had been announced. 'We're particularly surprised that . Aslef has announced further strike dates, rather than putting the offer . that was accepted in principle back in June to their members for . consideration. 'We hope Aslef can see sense and call off this unnecessary strike action. 'However, if the planned strike action does go ahead, we will be pulling . out all the stops to ensure that people can still travel by train and . enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime experience.' Transport . Secretary Justine Greening said: 'If there were an Olympic sport of . self-interest, Aslef union leaders would win it hands down. 'This . strike threatens Team GB's ability to plan travel from their UK base in . Loughborough and would disrupt journeys for thousands of commuters and . spectators.' Row: Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, left, called cutting pension contributions 'highly irresponsible', while right, David Cameron, has denounced proposed strikes by Home Office staff as not justifiable or right . Thousands of rail passengers commuting into London faced delays today following signalling problems near London Bridge. Blown fuses disrupted journeys into the city from the south and some services were cancelled. Services on the Brighton Mainline, Metro, Redhill, Mainline West and Mainline East were affected, Southern Railway said. A spokesman for Network Rail said the problem began at 5.30am when fuses blew at Honor Oak Park station. London Bridge is expected to be one of the busiest rail stations during the Olympics. As well as receiving commuters travelling in to work, London Bridge will be the departure point for many thousands attending Games events. Today's problem also affected services on the London Overground. It was the third day running that commuters had been hit by rush-hour delays. She added: 'Ed Miliband needs to get a grip on his union paymasters so they call off this damaging and unnecessary strike.' Train drivers staged six strikes in May . in protest at changes to their pensions but called off two further . stoppages in June to allow further talks. Aslef . is protesting at plans to reduce pension contributions, a move which . has been accepted by other unions with members on East Midlands Trains. General secretary Mick Whelan said: . 'To cut pension contributions in the current climate is highly . irresponsible. It is widely believed that the fund's assets have . dramatically decreased since the last valuation. 'Also, . any suggestion that drivers would save money ignores the fact that the . pension scheme is split 60/40 between the employer and the employee - so . if our members are saving £500, the company is saving £750. In total . that's £1,250 a year less going into the fund per active member. 'This . is simply storing up trouble for the next valuation and the future of . the scheme. It is disingenuous to suggest our members are getting . something for nothing.' He . added: 'The current owners of the East Midlands Trains (EMT) franchise . may have no responsibility over the pension fund in a few years, whereas . our members face the prospect of either cripplingly high contribution . rates or reduced benefits due to a short-term cost-cutting decision made . by EMT that has left the scheme in deficit.' One week to go: The rail strike is likely to cause chaos for those heading to the Olympic Stadium for the Games, which start next week . Meanwhile, members of the Rail, Maritime and . Transport (RMT) union on South West Trains have voted to take industrial . action short of a strike in a row over an Olympic bonus, but rejected . strikes by a narrow margin of four votes. Also today, it emerged thousands of . staff at the Home Office, including airport immigration workers, are to . stage a 24-hour strike the day before the opening of the Olympics in a . row over jobs, pay and other issues. Military personnel working on security for the Olympics will be able to travel free in London during the Games. London . Mayor Boris Johnson said all military personnel in uniform would not be . charged on services operated by Transport for London, including . the Tube and buses. This concession will last from Saturday to September 11. Mr . Johnson said: 'London is ready to welcome the world and host a hugely . successful Olympic and Paralympic Games. 'That success will be in no . small measure down to the contribution of our boys and girls in the . military. 'Now, as ever, they . have shown themselves ready to go above and beyond the call of duty' The Public and Commercial Services . union (PCS) said its members will walk out on July 26, and will take . other forms of industrial action, such as a ban on overtime, from July . 27 to August 20. The action will hit border controls . at ports and airports including Heathrow, threatening disruption to . people travelling to London for the Games. The union warned it will announce . further action if ministers continue to 'refuse' to negotiate an . agreement, warning that job and spending cuts are hitting services to . the public. The strike will involve staff across . the Home Office, including the UK Border Agency, the Identity and . Passport Service and Criminal Records Bureau. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka . said: 'The lives of staff have been made intolerable by these cuts and . they're at breaking point. 'Ministers have known about these issues for a very long time and need to act now to sort out the chaos they have caused.

"This is the week the dynamic of Liverpool’s season changes. And just when things are moving in the right direction for Brendan Rodgers. Two defeats in 22 games have seen the Anfield side move to within four points of the Champions League places and secure an FA Cup quarter-final slot after Saturday’s win at Selhurst Park. But how will the Merseysiders deal with the Europa League restarting this week? Daniel Sturridge (centre) volleys in Liverpool's equaliser in the 49th minute at Selhurst Park . Sturridge (left) and Alberto Moreno (right) celebrate after the Liverpool striker hit the equaliser . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has warned his players about the Europa League curse . It’s that Thursday-Sunday conundrum to which nobody seems to have the answer. Liverpool welcome Besiktas this Thursday before travelling to fellow Barclays Premier League top-four contenders Southampton on Sunday. Four days later they face the return leg in Turkey, before welcoming champions Manchester City on Sunday. So, is the Europa League a hindrance for Rodgers? ‘We want to play as many games as we can,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘It will be tough but when you’re winning games it gives you energy. We had tough games this week but the players have been brilliant and came through it well. Adam Lallana (centre) celebrates after his 58th minute goal put Liverpool 2-1 up against Palace in the FA Cup . Feb 19 - Besiktas (h) - Europa League . Feb 22 - Southampton (a) - Premier League . Feb 26 - Besiktas (a) - Europa League . Mar 1 - Man City (h)- Premier League . ‘Now we’ll recover and look forward to the Europa League because it’s a competition, like the FA Cup, we want to do well in.’ However, Rodgers is under no illusion that the competition will have an impact on the rest of Liverpool’s campaign. ‘There is no doubt that you’re always playing catch-up. It can be tough. But it’s a European competition, so it’s a very prestigious tournament. And a Champions League place for the winner makes it more attractive but there is still a way to go before you can think of that. Jordan Henderson produced an assured performance in the heart of the midfield for Liverpool . The FA Cup sixth-round draw will be made at 7.35pm on Monday, before kick-off in Preston's fifth-round tie with Man Utd. 1. Liverpool (Odds: 5/2) 2. Arsenal (13/8) 3. Aston Villa (16/1) 4. West Brom (10/1) 5. Bradford (66/1) 6. Blackburn (28/1) 7. Reading (33/1) 8. Preston (150/1) or Man Utd (3/1) ‘Certainly we’re very focused on doing well in it. The players are young and hungry and this is a group who can grow over the next couple of years. 'But we would like to get a trophy to signify that growth so the Europa League is a competition we will take seriously.’ Saturday’s win at Palace brought to an end Liverpool’s recent Selhurst Park hoodoo. When Palace took the lead through Fraizer Campbell, it looked as if Alan Pardew’s side would maintain their hold over Rodgers’ team. However, Liverpool hit back with two goals in nine minutes through Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana. So Pardew’s sole focus now is to ensure Palace retain their Premier League status, with the manager saying the appointments of Chris Ramsey at QPR and Tim Sherwood at Aston Villa will change the dynamic of the relegation battle. ‘A new manager is going to have an impact at some stage,’ said Pardew. ‘Players have got a new challenge, a new start to a degree. Those managers will be using those factors. Rodgers gave credit to Mario Balotelli (centre) for his role in Lallana's (left) winner . 'Of course now it is going to be a really tough race. The prize is getting bigger and bigger each year and the pressure on the managers gets bigger and bigger.’ On the appointment of Ramsey at Loftus Road, Pardew added: ‘I am very, very pleased that we have a black manager in the Premier League. It has been a long time coming and I am really pleased for him and for the Premier League.’ Palace find out on Monday if they face a second investigation in a week over missiles thrown by their fans after an incident following Sturridge’s equaliser.

"The trial of a 25-year-old Maine mother who allegedly drugged and smothered her young daughter to death in June 2013 began Monday. Defendant Leanna Norris pleaded not guilty to intentional or knowing murder in 2013, and in September entered a not guilty by reason of insanity plea, Bangor Daily News reported. Martha Harris, who is representing Norris, told the courtroom that her client  was depressed and had both anxiety and mood disorders last year, according to the newspaper. Though Harris had also said Norris wasn't at fault, Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norris knowingly committed the murder. 'She did not want Mike dating other women and did not want them mothering her child,' she reportedly said. Mother: Leanna Norris, seen Monday in court, is accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter Loh Grenada . Testimony: Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norris knowingly committed the murder and 'did not want Mike dating other women and did not want them mothering her child' Norris' ex-boyfriend Michael Grenda, who was the father to two-year-old Loh Grenda, testified Monday about the parents' estranged relationship, according to the newspaper. His testimony reportedly included that the couple's verbal disputes led to police being dispatched on multiple occasions -- and though Grenda broke up with Norris on June 16, 2013, the two agreed to stay and parent in the same residence. Norris' digital communications with different men stopped a potential reunion, he also said, according to Bangor Daily News. Murder trial: Leanna Norris, left, allegedly killed daughter Loh Grenada (right), in June 2013 before trying to take her own life . Prosecution: Assistant Attorney General Leann Zainea appears Monday in the courtroom . Grenda reportedly recounted his telling Norris on June 23 'that was the end of everything' - and then 'She became very upset. She was crying and smashing her head against the wall.' The 27-year-old's testimony also reportedly revealed that Norris cooled off that morning through his help, he left the home in the afternoon, and found out what happened to Loh Grenda on June 24. Steven Norris, the alleged murderer's father, testified though he and Leana Norris spent Father's Day and her June 18 birthday together, she had been unresponsive with her cell phone for several days before receiving a text message from her, Bangor Daily News reported. According to the newspaper, he recalled Monday that he received a a 2.27am phone call on June 24 from Leanna Norris, in which she admitted to killing her daughter. He also reportedly described how he contacted authorities as Leanna Norris' mother was on the phone with her, and Leanna Norris showed up at her parents' house and her daughter was dead inside the car. Leanna Norris was suicidal at her parent's house and wanted a gun, her father also reportedly testified. Judge: Superior Court Justice Ann Murray is pictured at the bench . The first day of the trial was held at Penobscot Judicial Center . Cowardly act: Norris allegedly gave her daughter Benadryl, duct-taped her mouth and covered her with a blanket so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes' Suicidal: Leanna Norris allegedly asked for a gun after her daughter's death . Bangor Daily News earlier reported that Leanna Norris was arrested last year after Loh Grenda's body was found in the front seat of her car in Stetson, Maine, on June 24, 2013. According to the newspaper, her affidavit by Maine State Police Detective Thomas Pickering  said she offered 'two or three syringes of Benadryl to make [Loh Grenda] go to sleep.' 'Leanna Norris put black Gorilla [duct] tape on Loh Grenda’s mouth and nose; that Leanna Norris put a blanket over Loh Grenda’s face so she would not have to look at Loh’s eyes,' the affidavit reportedly said. ' Leanna Norris said that she killed Loh Grenda; that Leanna Norris put her hand over Loh Grenda’s face and suffocated her.' Norris said she took the tape off 'so it would not look so horrible', the affidavit is said to reveal. Later at a Stetson cemetery was 'where [Leanna Norris] took pills and put tape on her face in order to kill herself,' the affidavit also reportedly said. But, after vomiting, the 24-year-old allegedly called her father, Steven Norris, and then drove to his house, where he discovered his granddaughter dead under a blanket.

"England are ready to address defensive concerns ahead of the match with Ireland on Sunday week which could decide the RBS 6 Nations title. Stuart Lancaster’s team will start the countdown to the Dublin encounter with the other unbeaten side in the championship by holding an inquest after conceding three tries at home to Italy. Despite winning 47-17, England are well aware similar lapses in Dublin could shatter their challenge for another year. Despite a strong start to the Six Nations, Stuart Lancaster knows his England side need to improve . England followed up their 21-16 win over Wales with a 47-17 triumph against Italy on Saturday . But England were guilty of a slow start and Lancaster knows England cannot afford that against Ireland . Lancaster was asked if defence guru Andy Farrell will go ‘mad’ after seeing the English line being breached with alarming regularity. Lancaster said: ‘I think he probably will. We were a bit soft on the edges. We pride ourselves on getting off the line and putting pressure on the opposition and we did that extremely well in the second half. We were just a bit slow out of the blocks. That reflected in the first try.’ Defensive shortcomings and another slow start were also raised by captain Chris Robshaw, who said: ‘We gave away a couple of soft tries.’ Asked to explain how England allowed Italy to score in the fourth minute, he added: ‘We were a bit passive defensively in the whole game. As soon as they got hold of the ball they made easy yards and Parisse got over in the corner. It’s an area to look at.’ Jamie Heaslip (centre) in action for Ireland in their 18-11 victory over France on Saturday .

"Everything was as expected at the World Cup on Monday – Ireland defeated West Indies and are already well placed to reach the quarter-finals of a competition that is almost designed to stop the smaller teams progressing. There was no surprise, no real sense of an upset about Ireland’s ability to chase down West Indies 304 for seven with 25 balls in hand in Nelson, just a grim realisation that a side with a proud cricketing heritage are in big trouble. West Indies, racked by in-fighting, have been an accident waiting to happen at this World Cup and, in a strong and purposeful Ireland, they came up against the perfect team to take advantage of their vulnerability in their opening game. Ireland's batsman Niall O'Brien (right) and team-mate John Mooney celebrate their win over West Indies . Ireland celebrate as the beaten West Indies side trudge off the field in Nelson after their defeat . Ed Joyce hit a crucial knock of 84 to set Ireland up for the victory in their opening Pool B game . Irish fans celebrate their side's stunning start to their World Cup campaign after the win over the West Indies . The Irish fans made quite the spectacle in New Zealand as they looked forward to a successful tournament . This is the third time Ireland, crammed with experienced county cricketers, have defeated a ‘big’ team at a World Cup and can now add the scalp of West Indies to those of Pakistan in 2007 and, of course, England four years ago. There is a sense of grievance in Irish cricket about their lack of games against Test nations, the decision of the International Cricket Council to reduce the next World Cup to 10 teams and England’s habit of poaching their players. Well, this was the perfect way for them to show that they are deadly serious about their desire to not only play more one-day internationals but also to gain the full Test status that they crave. And there were plenty of Irishman who were claiming that Eoin Morgan, the Dubliner now captaining England at this World Cup, would struggle to get in their side now anyway. And that was no Irish joke. It looked as though Ireland might have blown their chance when they allowed West Indies to recover from the depths of 87 for five to reach a total that they should have been able to defend, however good the Saxton Oval pitch. Yet it is fair to say that Ireland’s successful chase never really looked in doubt and would have been even more convincing had they not suffered a late stutter which saw them eventually lose six wickets in cantering home. At the centre of what will go down as another significant day for Ireland were four players well known in England for their stature in the domestic game. Firstly George Dockrell, the Somerset left-arm spinner, took three wickets before Lendl Simmons, with 102 from 84 balls, and Darren Sammy, who hit four sixes in his 89, rescued West Indies from complete embarrassment. Paul Stirling was named man of the match after impressing with the bat against the West Indies . Ireland batsman John Mooney celebrates their win over the West Indies on Monday . Joyce was one of Ireland's success stories as he helped them chase down the West Indies . Paul Stirling fell just six runs short of his century but laid the foundations for Ireland's triumph . The Irish fans were in the mood to party as they watched their side win their World Cup opener . West Indies' Jason Holder cries in anguish (left) as O'Brien is congratulated by Darren Sammy (right) Then Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce and Niall O’Brien, all prolific county performers, showed a calmness and authority with the bat that West Indies and their rookie captain Jason Holder had no answer to. Stirling, the hard-hitting Middlesex opener, led the way with 92 despite being struck on the helmet by Jerome Taylor before Sussex’s Joyce took control of the middle of the innings and Leicestershire’s O’Brien supplied the finish. This was another triumph for Joyce who, at 36, is playing the best cricket of his career and could have achieved the ambition of playing Test cricket that led to him defecting to England had he stayed with his adopted country. Instead the man who once scored a century for England against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground and played for them in the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean has now set his sights on playing the ultimate game for his own nation. If he carries on like this you would not put it past him. Conversely, these are grim times for West Indies. They still use the David Rudder’s ‘Rally Round the West Indies’ as their national anthem and never has that calypso anthem been more apt than in their current chaotic plight. They arrived here without two of their best players in Dwayne Bravo and Keiron Pollard, banished for their leading roles in instigating strike action in India in October, and with poor Holder having to lead them at the age of just 23. They were a rabble in a warm-up game against England last week which led to their manager Richie Richardson, one of the many great West Indian players let down by the current generation, saying they did not want to peak too early. On this evidence they are not going to peak at all and face an early exit from this elongated tournament if they do not buck their ideas up quickly. George Dockrell took three wickets for Ireland after the West Indies were put into bat first . O'Brien held his nerve to guide Ireland through the final balls and to victory . Lendl Simmons hit a century for the West Indies but he was not backed up by his team-mates . A dejected Darren Sammy speaks to the media after his West Indies slumped to defeat . Denesh Ramdin of the West Indies celebrates after taking the wicket of Paul Stirling . Ireland fans dressed to impress as they watched their side chase down the West Indies . Goodness knows what West Indies team England will face in the Caribbean in April as their better players will prefer to cash in at the Indian Premier League at the same time, the perfect example of their modern day priorities. ‘It was a tough loss,’ said Holder, a promising fast bowler whose development can only be stifled by having to captain the side. ‘We backed ourselves to defend 304 but we leaked too many boundaries and couldn’t do it.’ A measure of Ireland’s ambition came in the matter of fact way they greeted victory. ‘It was great to get our first victory,’ said Stirling in expectation of gaining several more. ‘I owed the lads 90 after dropping Sammy on nought.’ William Porterfield, the Ireland captain, was equally sanguine when he said: ‘Hopefully this sets us up for the next few games and we are in a great position now. Our belief has been growing for a while now and we know what we’re capable of. We didn’t just feel we could win this game but others too.’ It is in many ways a great shame that Morgan and Boyd Rankin, who England still want in their set-up despite his chastening Ashes tour, do not play for their own country and Ireland are desperate to stop the drain of talent. They are not impressed either that England’s bi-annual fixture against Ireland can only be fitted in this summer at Malahide on May 8, immediately after England’s tour of the Caribbean, effectively ruling out their main players. Yet if they can carry on like this – and the ICC give them a fairer crack of the whip – then all Irish cricketers really could be encouraged to stay at home.","Ireland put the West Indies into bat and they made 304-7 from 50 overs .

"It seems that Kevin Pietersen is as good at bombing into a swimming pool as England are at beating Australia at cricket. The exiled England batsman appears to have been enjoying some time by the swimming pool while Eoin Morgan's side were once again mercilessly dissected by their arch rivals in their opening game at the cricket World Cup. The 34-year-old Pietersen posted a video to his Instagram account with the caption 'top bombing?!' that shows him taking a running leap into a swimming pool, while tucking his legs into his body and inexplicably turning sideways before hitting the water.

Had it not been for the defiance of James Taylor's unbeaten 98, the margin of Australia's victory would have been much more emphatic. Pietersen will undertake commentary duties with BBC's Test Match Special from the quarter-final stage onwards and it remains to be seen whether he will be running the rule over the England side.","Kevin Pietersen has been enjoying time by the pool during the World Cup .

"Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson has told Saido Berahino to stop ‘bleating’ and ‘moaning’ after the England hopeful was elbowed in the face by Marcin Wasilewski on Saturday. The West Brom striker, 21, had treatment after what he described as a ‘clear elbow’ from the Pole in the second half. The FA will read referee Stuart Attwell’s report on Monday — the elbow went unpunished — and consider whether action is necessary. But an angry Pearson said Berahino should leave the talking to his manager Alan Irvine. Pearson said: ‘If they want punishment I’m disappointed. Saido is wrong — it was good defending. ‘He’s not gone to elbow him. It’s called the 'clothes line'. Saido Berahino (left) looked to be elbowed by Leicester City's Marcin Wasilewski .

Players should keep their mouth shut and perform on the pitch.’ Berahino was reluctant to discuss the incident further but said: ‘I will let the FA take care of it.’ One way or another, the England Under 21 striker is becoming the talking point of a West Brom side which has now suffered just one defeat in six League games.

Leicester have scored only twice and conceded eight in five games since beating Manchester United 5-3. At one stage on Saturday their supporters chanted Irvine’s name — quite a turnaround from the summer when his appointment was greeted by significant indifference. That change in mood is largely down to the form of Berahino, who was central to the move that led to Esteban Cambiasso’s own goal in West Brom’s win. Roy Hodgson is considering handing him an England call this month and the striker said selection would allow him to ‘repay’ the nation, having moved here aged 10 to escape war-torn Burundi. ‘It would mean the world to me,’ said Berahino. ‘England, the UK as a whole, has given me a second chance in life. ‘I am helping my family and we are living a good life. It would be great for me to repay in that way.’ David Nugent is angered by a decision from referee Stuart Attwell which clearly didn't go his way .

To the uninitiated, the wall art might show some nonsensical numbers and patterns, but it actually includes code alongside some of the world's greatest technological minds, including Alan Turing (pictured) The artwork, which has been created in London, Birmingham and Bristol, challenges members of the public to break the codes to be in with a chance of winning tickets to a big technology fair. A wall in Shoreditch, London is pictured . Poor operational procedures and sloppy operator behaviour led to code breakers deciphering the Enigma cipher machine used by the Nazis. The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named 'Ultra' and helped the Alllies defeat U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic. Cryptanalysts were chosen to work at Bletchley for various intellectual achievements, whether they were linguists, chess champions, crossword experts or mathematicians and in one instance, the ability to solve a Daily Telegraph crossword in under 12 minutes was used as a test. Alan Turing is arguably the most famous code-breaker to work at Bletchley and devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. The graffiti contains undeciphered Morse code, JavaScript and Binary code that hides a secret message and is part of a bid to get young people interested in coding, which is essential to develop computer software and more. Alan Turing, who is widely considered to be the godfather of computer science, is pictured in two of the urban murals as this month marks the 75th anniversary of the Government Code and Cypher Schools' arrival at Bletchley Park.

"Louis van Gaal will make signing a creative midfielder his top priority this summer. Van Gaal has spent more than £150million on seven new players since he took charge of Manchester United just over seven months ago, but he is still not happy with the squad at his disposal. Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Ander Herrera accounted for over two thirds of United's spending spree last year, but Van Gaal thinks he still lacks a dynamic midfielder to dictate play. Louis van Gaal wants to sign a creative midfielder and has made it his main priority this summer . Van Gaal signed attacking midfielder Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid for £60million last August . Van Gaal also bought Holland midfielder Daley Blind (centre) for £14million from Ajax . Ander Herrera (left) was bought for £29million from Athletic Bilbao but has found first team games limited . The lack of such a figure in the current United squad has led the Dutchman to deploy Wayne Rooney in midfield. While Rooney is happy in midfield, according to Van Gaal, there is a feeling that the England captain is being placed there as a stop-gap until a more suitable candidate becomes available. When asked whether he was playing Rooney there because he felt no-one else was capable of fulfilling that midfield role, Van Gaal said: 'Of course that's the case. I'm looking for balance and I need it in midfield. 'The last games I played with Adnan Januzaj and Angel di Maria in the midfield positions. Then you need a certain balance for those kind of creative players. 'So when you have these creative players and you think that (Radamel) Falcao and Robin van Persie are also creative, then you have four creative players. Then you have to look for balance in your team.' When it was put to him that signing a creative midfielder should be top of his agenda this summer, Van Gaal agreed . 'Yes, of course,' the 63-year-old said. Roma's Kevin Strootman fits the bill perfectly. Kevin Strootman (right) of Roma is one midfielder who fits Van Gaal's specifictation . Paul Pogba (left) of Juventus could also interest Van Gaal and he also used to play for Manchester United . The midfielder was a regular in Van Gaal's Holland team until he suffered a knee injury that ruled him out of the World Cup. In an uncharacteristic move, Van Gaal last year declared his interest in signing the 25-year-old once his injury problems were over. Strootman recently suffered another setback which will keep him out until the end of the season, but a summer move is not out of the question. Paul Pogba, property of Serie A rivals Juventus, keeps being linked with his former club. Rooney looks like he will have to spend some time in midfield from now until the end of the season. There has been no hint of objection to that move from the 29-year-old himself, according to Van Gaal. 'He's happy. Otherwise he should come to me and say he's not happy and he never does,' said Van Gaal, who takes his team to Preston in the FA Cup on Monday. 'He's always friendly to me. He wants to perform what I want so that's what I see.' Van Gaal admits the United skipper may still be yearning for a move back to his preferred role, though. Van Gaal said that United captain Wayne Rooney (left) has not been complaining about his midfield role . Preston's Kevin Davies will face United in the FA Cup and says the players look unhappy under Van Gaal . 'Of course when the whole world is writing he has to be in the striker's position, he will be thinking 'maybe, hey'. He's human,' the Dutchman added. Veteran Preston striker Kevin Davies stirred up the tension between the two teams this week by claiming United's players did not look happy under Van Gaal. 'They're not exciting as they used to be but the club has had big change,' the former Bolton forward said. Davies' comments were put to Van Gaal at a press conference on Friday. But after spending a big chunk of the press conference talking about Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball United' jibe and Paul Scholes' criticism of his former club, the Dutchman was in no mood to get involved in a war of words with Davies. 'I can't react to everybody's opinion,' he said. Michael Carrick (centre) will miss United's FA Cup clash with Preston on Monday due to a calf injury . United striker Robin van Persie (right) could also miss out with an unspecified injury . 'There's such an amount of opinions from fans, and I don't think he is a fan.' United will be without Michael Carrick for Monday's tie at Deepdale as he has suffered a setback in his recovery from a calf injury, but Daley Blind should return following his head injury. Van Gaal will make a late call on Robin van Persie, who is suffering with an unspecified injury.","Louis van Gaal wants to buy a creative midfielder for Manchester United .

"Google is working on a plan to eliminate computer passwords and allow users to log-in using their smart phone or a small chip that can be embedded in rings and bracelets. The company is trying out different options to create more secure ways for its 500 million users to use their accounts - and a more convenient method than remembering a host of passwords. Google has been working with a company called Yubico - who make a USB device called a YubiKey which can be programed for a two-step, secure log-in. Tighter controls: Google have been looking at plans to make their accounts more secure for users . However carrying around a token may not be seen as a positive change for many users so Google is exploring other options, according to Wired. Google Vice President of Security . Eric Grosse and engineer Mayank Upadhyay said that passwords and cookies . are no longer enough to keep their users safe from hackers. Google introduced a two-step log-in in 2011, making it more difficult for your account to be hacked - and it had a successful uptake among users. Accounts are given tighter security by linking them to your smartphone. Each time a Google user logs in via a different computer, they receive a code in a text message to vouch for who they are - however even this plan has its flaws. People may find that they are just as likely to lose a token as forget a password. There is also the issue that if the device is lost or stolen, then an individual's accounts would be wide open.

"Long hours in nurseries or with childminders lead to mental health problems and difficulties at school for children, a leading expert claimed yesterday. According to researcher Jonas Himmelstrand, falling educational standards and a wave of disorder and bullying in schools are directly connected to state subsidies for daycare. His report is to be presented to MPs this week by pressure group Mothers at Home Matter, which is calling on politicians to cut childcare subsidies and instead ease the bias in the tax and benefit system against those who stay at home to bring up their children. Quandary: Mothers are in the awkward position of being encouraged to go out to work but also told to spend enough time with their children . The analysis looked at the situation in Mr Himmelstrand’s homeland of Sweden where more than nine out of ten children spend their early years in nurseries. He said: ‘Swedish schools have among the highest truancy, the greatest classroom disorder, the most damage to property and the most offensive language of all comparable nations. I would urge policy makers in the UK to rethink their approach to childcare. ‘Emulating the Swedish approach, where both the staff-to-child ratio and the number of hours children spend in day care are both increasing, is not the answer and is actually damaging to your children’s future.’ Mr Himmelstrand is a controversial figure in Sweden. He now lives outside the country because of what he calls state persecution of his family because of his decision to educate his children at home. He said: ‘The early exposure of large groups of peers leads to peer-orientation, which has detrimental results on psychological maturation, learning and the transference of culture between generations. It is at the root of bullying, teenage gangs, promiscuity and the flat-lining of culture.’ The fresh claims come as ministers here redouble efforts to encourage British mothers to go out to work. A majority of mothers of toddlers now take jobs and use nurseries, childminders, nannies or friends or relatives to look after their children while they work. Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss has said it is ‘vital’ for mothers to work and is planning changes to childcare regulations to allow fewer staff to look after more pre-school children. Families with just one working parent have faced increasing risks of poverty in recent years. Childcare controversy: Researcher Jonas Himmelstrand linked disorder, truancy and low educational standards to parents not spending enough time with their children . The non-working parent gets no help from the tax credit system which subsidises single parents, and the income tax system, unlike those in most of the developed world, gives no extra help to two-parent families or workers with family responsibilities. David Cameron has yet to make good his 2010 election manifesto promise to give a tax break to married couples. A number of research projects over the past two decades have suggested young children who spend long hours in daycare can suffer in later years in performance at school. The Himmelstrand findings said psychological problems among Swedish schoolgirls have tripled since the 1980s; Swedish schools, which 30 years ago were among the best in the world, now produce average results and are below average for maths; and that Swedish schools now have among the worst discipline problems in Europe. Marie Peacock, of Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘We urge British policymakers not to try to imitate a Scandinavian system that is yielding negative results. 'The public debate focuses on the supposed advantages of childcare, but there is no parallel discussion in terms of the value of mothers.’","Research says that bad behaviour is linked to hours spent without parents .

"Daniel Coriat has been sent to a secure mental ward indefinitely after admitting killing and beheading his elderly mother at the flat they shared in Forrest Hill, south London . A paranoid schizophrenic who killed and decapitated his elderly mother because he believed she was a witch will spend the rest of his life in a secure mental ward. Daniel Coriat, 44, was seen wandering the streets naked like 'a zombie' before police found him hiding in a wheelie bin in a train station following the murder. He told officers he was the son of God and had been living in the bin since he 'came down from the sky two months ago', the Old Bailey heard today. He made 'Hannibal Lecter suckling noises' before snarling at officers as he was arrested and put into a police van. Emergency services found his mother Elizabeth,76, brutally murdered at the flat they shared together in Forest Hill, south London, in March last year. She had suffered almost 50 separate injuries and her head had been cut off completely off, rotated 180 degrees, and placed back on her body. ‘His mother was found on her bed, . fully clothed, decapitated and mutilated with various weapons embedded . in her head and body,’ said prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC. ‘There were injuries to the wrists and ankles, suggesting a crucifixion-like pattern.’ Coriat was due to stand trial for the murder of his mother Elizabeth, 76, but prosecutors accepted a guilty plea to manslaughter today. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 18, he would often fly into explosive rages when he stopped taking his medication, the court heard. He mutilated his mother’s body with an arsenal of weapons including carving knives, secateurs, a chef’s steel and a pruning saw. Neighbours saw him walking naked and around near his flat and described the property having fallen eerily silent. One said: ‘He had a blank vacant stare. He was walking really slowly like a zombie, staring straight ahead.’ A judge at the Old Bailey has sentenced Daniel Coriat to stay in a secure mental ward indefinitely after he admitted killing his mother Elizabeth . During an earlier court hearing, he claimed his mother was a witch, adding: ‘You saw the body when it was taken away. It didn’t look human.’ Flanked by psychiatric nurses, Coriat laughed loudly in the dock as a judge ordered he be locked away in a mental hospital indefinitely. Judge Richard Hone QC told him: ‘I have come to the clear conclusion your mental illness is the primary component of this terrible offence. ‘My task is to ensure the public is safeguarded as far as possible from any recurrence of this bizarre, grisly and grotesque violence.’ Addressing the Coriat family, he added: ‘They must all receive the full sympathy of all those in court in the context of this simply awful event.’ The murder charge was left to lie on the court file.","Daniel Coriat, 44, murdered his mother Elizabeth, 76, before mutilating her body at flat they shared in Forrest Hill, south London .

"It was a breathtaking symbol  of the power, prestige and  scientific supremacy of the British Empire. Now the Crystal Palace, which housed the Great Exhibition of 1851, could be reincarnated – thanks to a billionaire Chinese developer. Shanghai-based ZhongRong Holdings, owned by one of China’s richest men, wants to recreate the 900,000sq ft cast iron and plate glass building in the area of South-East London named after it. Chinese developer ZhongRong Holdings has put forward a proposal to rebuild Crystal Palace. Owned by billionaire businessman Ni Zhaoxing, the firm wants to replicate the London venue built for the Great Exhibition of 1851. The plan is still at the ‘very early . stages’, sources said, but London Mayor Boris Johnson confirmed that he . had been approached by a potential developer, thought to be billionaire . Ni Zhaoxing. The original structure was designed by Sir Joseph Paxton and stood in . Hyde Park, where the exhibition was held. In 1854 it was rebuilt – in a . larger form – on Penge Common, near Sydenham Hill in South London, and . stood there until it was destroyed a fire in 1936. According to business magazine Property Week, ZhongRong wants the . replica Crystal Palace to host events and exhibitions and aims to submit . a planning application later this year. The company was set up in 1992 by Ni Zhaoxing, a married father of four . and self-made businessman said to have a fortune of $1.25billion . (£810million). The 57-year-old was a new entry this year in the ‘billionaires list’ compiled by business bible Forbes magazine, and was placed at number 76 . in its ‘China rich list’. Mr Ni’s past projects include the futuristic Zhongrong Jasper Tower in . Shanghai’s financial district and Chang’an No.1 in Beijing, a group of . ‘78 European-style villas set in a mountain landscape’, Forbes said. Devastation: A massive fire burnt Crystal Palace to the ground in 1936 . Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Johnson said the mayor was ‘committed to . finding a long-term  sustainable future for Crystal  Palace park’. He confirmed that the mayor  and the borough of Bromley had been . ‘approached by a potential developer keen to redevelop a  large section . of the north side of the park’. The spokesman added: ‘Discussions between all parties remain  at a very . early feasibility stage but the plans do not include any residential . development. ‘Any fully formed proposal would of course be presented to the public . for comment in order to build a consensus on the way forward.’ A Bromley Council spokesman said: ‘We are committed to improving Crystal . Palace park, which remains a jewel not just in Bromley’s, but in . London’s crown. ‘We are continuing to explore all funding options, including grant . funding, that might be available to help secure a long-term and viable . future. ‘As part of this, we have had discussions with a number of parties and all of these conversations remain at early stages.’ Relocation: The Crystal Palace moved to Penge Common near Sydenham Hill in south-east London in 1854 .

"Do you have moles — those clusters of pigment that dot our arms, legs and face? According to Chinese astrology, their position on the face or body gives a useful insight into your personality, state of mind, future and health. Armed with this knowledge, you can avert disaster and capitalise on success. Simon Wong, an author and expert in Chinese astrology for 30 years, says mole analysis is often used in Chinese medicine. A mole on the cheek like Marilyn Monroe's can represent potential accidents in later life . ‘It helps build patients’ mental and physical profiles to aid diagnosis and treatment,’ he says. Chinese astrologers believe changes in the body are caused by emotional or physiological responses to life events, so reading moles can give clues to ‘energy channels’. ‘Chi (energy) is more active in certain parts of the face and body at different times in a person’s life. Its flow can be emphasised or obstructed by the position of a healthy mole.’ A mole on the cheek suggests loneliness and being unable to settle down or form a family, although Eva Mendes has just announced the birth of her first child with Ryan Gosling . During our teenage years, moles increase in number; in pregnancy, they get darker; and they can disappear from the age of 40. To help you understand what they can mean for you, here is Simon Wong’s guide to mole reading: . FOREHEAD . In the centre of the forehead, it means you aren’t communicating well with people in authority, such as your boss or parents. On the side of the head, it shows you have focus, drive and energy. EYEBROWS . Under the eyebrow, it signals abundant wealth. When a mole is hidden from view, it is considered to be even more significant and special, like hidden treasure. One above the eyebrow — like Angelina Jolie — represents a steady flow of money in your life. EYELIDS . A mole on the eyelid symbolises disharmony within the family and a tendency to lose money. ‘Crying moles’ — those under the eyes — are a sign that you are overly emotional. CHEEK . This suggests loneliness and being unable to settle down or form a family. If it’s on or next to the crease of your face when you smile — like Marilyn Monroe and Michael Schumacher — it can represent potential accidents. EARS . In Chinese astrology, ears represent your character, so a mole on the earlobes is a sign of a good personality and reputation. One inside the ear means long life while one on the top of the ear symbolises intelligence. If you have moles on both ears, you will be influential and enjoy a comfortable life. A mole by the mouth, like Cindy Crawford's, suggests a person who enjoys good food and the finer things in life . NOSE . Be careful if you have a mole on the end of the nose: it represents instability as it’s in a precarious position. It means relationship problems ahead. One on the bridge of the nose obstructs the flow of chi or energy as it flows downwards as we breathe, so symbolises entrapment or trouble ahead. It is also the sign of a hard worker because they labour to stabilise their energy flow. Moles on the side of the nose, near the nostrils or hidden, indicates someone who is good with money, especially at protecting their bank account. CHIN . Having a mole on the chin means tenacity, determination and stubbornness. It can lead to success or failure depending on how you direct this in your life. It can also represent the need for change or travel (because the chin is always moving). LIPS . The ‘food luck’ mole is found on the right or left corner of the upper lip. You enjoy good food, are generous and enjoy the finer things in life. A mole on the bottom lip means your children will be successful. NECK . The neck forms a link between the head and body, or the ‘spirit’ and ‘physical’. A mole here obstructs the flow of energy and can mean disappointment. One in the centre of the neck represents a wild character who may cause their family grief. ARM . Moles below the elbow show you are compassionate; those between the shoulder and elbow are a sign you get money easily. CHEST . The chest symbolises power, so a mole here shows high status in society or your profession. STOMACH . Mariah Carey's has a mole near her chin which means tenacity, determination and stubbornness . The navel is a treasure point in Chinese astrology, so the closer a mole is towards the centre of the stomach, the more auspicious you are or will be. HANDS . This shows you are skilful, which could make you a lot of money. BACK . This means you are carrying a burden. You will work hard in life, so success is possible. It just takes you longer to get there. LEGS . One on the thigh represents sexuality and someone who is bold and extrovert. On the calf, it relates to fitness problems, most likely from working too hard. Those with moley knees — a lucky wealth spot — find it easy to make money. BREAST . This signifies you are a nurturing mother and will have a powerful place in society because of it. In Chinese astrology, the success of a mother’s children brings increased power and reputation. A mole on the nipple is a sign your children will do very well in their profession and more generally throughout their lives in love, luck and wealth. FOOT . You have the ability to be a good leader if a mole is on your sole. Feet represent travelling or marching and people will be drawn to follow you. It can also signal that you will receive recognition for good deeds. BOTTOM . This part of the body is linked to abundant food and wealth. A mole here signifies a good reputation, generosity and the inclination to help others.","According to Chinese astrology, the position of moles is important .
It gives a useful insight into your personality, state of mind, future and health .

"Tim Sherwood has told his Aston Villa players to shake off the shackles and begin to throw punches in their fight against relegation. The new Villa manager gave a bold first press conference and has vowed to get Christian Benteke back firing, underlining how important the Belgian striker will be in keeping the club up. Sherwood is aiming for six wins from Villa's final 13 Premier League matches to ensure safety and also made a jovial reference to reaching the FA Cup final. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood has cited Christian Benteke as a key player to help them fight relegation . Sherwood was speaking on Monday at his press conference unveiling to the media as their new manager . Sherwood has targeted six wins from Villa's final 13 Premier League matches to ensure safety .

The gilets have been reduced in price to £29 and were a popular item choice  to wear by Sherwood at Spurs . The 46-year-old visited the dressing room at half-time of the FA Cup win over Leicester City, and told the players to get the ball to Benteke more often. Sherwood said: ‘I told them to play with less fear, I thought it was a bit tentative. Also to get Christian Benteke in the game a lot more. He was making good runs. We needed to look for him a bit earlier and to try and fill the box up more, give them something to think about. 'There is a little bit of apprehension about the place, obviously from losing football matches. We need to play with a little more freedom. Get the shackles off us. They are all good players, they need to play with more confidence and everything will be fine. 'I remember playing against Christian Benteke as a manager, what a handful he can be. We need to get back to that. He needs a goal for himself. That will breed confidence. 'He will be an important part because we know what he can be. All the best clubs in the world were after him. I’m sure we can tap into that confidence and get him back firing. Sherwood (centre) watched from the stands as his new side were in action at Villa Park . ‘It's certainly not a one-man team, though. There are a lot of big players, no one wants to get relegated. It will hurt them to drop into the Championship. We can’t let that happen. They need to step to the front now, start performing. 'You will win games and lose games from now until the end of the season. But let’s have a go fighting. We need to start throwing a few punches ourselves.' Asked if 13 games was enough to save Villa, with the club in the relegation zone on 22 points, Sherwood said: 'We need six wins, so it will be enough.’ Predecessor Paul Lambert had described the run-in as 13 Cup finals. ‘Paul’s right,’ said Sherwood, speaking at Villa Park. ‘But hopefully it will be 14 with the FA Cup.' He added: 'We need to make this place a fortress, make it bouncing. We all believe we will stay in the division. We need everyone onside.

"At least two burglars broke into a house in White Plains, New York, on Saturday and headed straight for the gun safe. The thieves struck just three weeks after the address and home owner's name, registered to a legal firearms permit, was published on the controversial gun map published by the Journal News. The burglars couldn't open the safe and the owner wasn't at home. But this incident has led to speculation that the map is now being used by criminals for targeted gun theft. This home in White Plains, New York, is also listed on the controversial gun map and was broken into on Saturday . The thieves broke into the property at 9.30pm on Saturday, using a ladder to enter through a second story window. According to Newsday, the burglars then headed for the safe where the homeowner, a man in his 70s, stores his legally owned guns. The intruders abandoned their attempts when they couldn't crack the safe, and police say that one suspect has been taken into custody. The home owner declined to comment while police continue their investigations but a New York state senator has again blasted the gun map after this incident. 'No comment': The White Plains homeowner told News12 he had nothing to add while police continued investigations into the burglary . 'Criminal's shopping list?' Both homes  are featured on the map that lists the names and addresses of legal gun owners . Republican Senator Greg Ball has proposed legislation that restricts gun permit information to law enforcement authorities and he strongly criticized the Journal News. 'It is reported that the burglar used the Journal News’ interactive gun map to target a home included on the map,' Ball said in statement. 'The Journal News has placed the lives of these folks at risk by creating a virtual shopping list for criminals and nut jobs. 'If the connection is proven, this is further proof that these maps are not only an invasion of privacy but that they present a clear and present danger to law-abiding, private citizens. 'Former convicts have already testified to the usefulness of the asinine Journal News ‘gun maps’ yet the reckless editors are evidently willing to roll the dice, gambling with the lives of innocent local homeowners,' the senator continued. 'Reckless': A New York State Senator blasted the Journal News for their controversial gun map . The New York newspaper reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper's headquarters in West Nyack after publishing the names and addresses of nearby . gun permit owners. The paper caused a stir on December 23 when it listed thousands of . pistol permit holders in suburban Westchester and Rockland counties just . north of New York City in an interactive map. The Rockland County Times reported that Journal News editor Caryn A. McBride hired gun-toting security guards to guard the paper's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days. Along with an article entitled 'The . gun owner next door: What you don't know about the weapons in your . neighborhood,' the Journal News map was compiled in response to the December 14 . shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, . editors of the Gannett Corp.-owned newspaper said. The publication prompted outrage, particularly on social media sites, among gun owners. 'Do you fools realize that you also . made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns . in them to protect themselves?' Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, . posted on the newspaper's web site. 'What a bunch of liberal boobs you . all are.' Calling for change: The paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the Newtown shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood, and there were protests across the country (pictured). The newspaper's editor and vice . president of news, CynDee Royle, defended the . decision to list the permit holders. 'We knew publication of the database . would be controversial, but we felt sharing as much information as we . could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of . the Newtown shootings,' she said. Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online. Howard Good, a journalism professor . at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' response childish and petulant. On the list: As well as Journal News the website Gawker published a 446-page list of licensed gun owners in New York City . 'It doesn't move the issue of gun . control to the level of intelligent public discussion,' he said. 'Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a . contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.' Good said the information about permit holders was public and, if presented in context, served a legitimate interest. But media critic Al Tompkins of the . Florida-based Poynter Institute wrote online this week that the . newspaper's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit . holders' loss of privacy. 'If journalists could show flaws in . the gun permitting system, that would be newsworthy,' he said. 'Or, for . example, if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political . connections, then journalists could better justify the privacy . invasion.' Tompkins said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears. 'The net effect of the abuse of public . records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening . records, which would be the biggest mistake of all,' he said.","Address in White Plains, New York, appears on map of legally owned guns published by Journal News on December 23 .

"Adrian Muir has been jailed for 18 years for the manslaughter of Pamela Jackson . A son has said 'there's no justice' after the man who killed his mother before burying her body in a shallow moorland grave 120 miles away was jailed for 18 years. Adrian Muir killed much-loved mother and grandmother Pamela Jackson at her home in Chester-le-Street, County . Durham, then transported her corpse in the back of his car to the moors . near Halifax in West Yorkshire. He was cleared of murdering Ms Jackson but was found guilty of manslaughter at Newcastle Crown Court following a four week trial. Ms Jackson’s son Andrew Jackson today said Muir would only serve half the 18 year term. He said: 'Nine years for a man that’s capable of killing someone and burying them on the moors - there’s no justice.' Muir, 51, used a spade to dig a grave on the moors near Halifax before burying 55-year-old Ms Jackson's body along with a bunch of flowers in a Tesco carrier bag. Sentencing him at Newcastle Crown Court today, Judge James Goss QC said Muir killed Ms Jackson by 'striking her repeatedly to the head and then when she was on the ground delivering a blow or blows to her head of such force that she suffered fractures to her skull and bleeding to her brain'. He said: 'Your reaction to assaulting her was to remove her body from her house, take her to West Yorkshire, where you concealed and buried her high on the Pennines in a grave which I have no doubt you intended would never be found and be unknown to anyone besides you.' The public gallery erupted into chaos as Ms Jackson’s family broke down and shouted angrily at Muir, who showed no emotion, at the trial’s conclusion. Muir carried out the killing at Ms Jackson's home in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, then transported her corpse in the back of his car to the moors near Halifax in West Yorkshire . During the trial the court heard that Muir had made a series of taped confessions about what he had done before joining her family who were frantically searching for her. Muir was arrested and charged with murder just days after the grandmother and mother-of-three was reported missing. But it took detectives, who launched a nationwide search, two months to track down Ms Jackson’s grave site on moorland Muir knew 'every inch' of due to his fell running, outdoor hobbies and work commitments as a dry-stone waller in the area. She had died as a result of blunt force injury to the head caused by at least four blows. Muir, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, had denied murder and claimed he had been framed by the 'real killer'. After two days of deliberation a jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Muir's telephone and car had been traced travelling from Ms Jackson’s home to her grave site on the last day her family saw her alive, his fingerprint being found on the carrier bag inside her grave, and a CCTV camera caught Muir cleaning the back of his Kia in a Chester-le-Street supermarket. The Kia car Muir used to drive Ms Jackson's body to the burial location . Jurors heard during the trial how Muir left his partner of 32-years after he met Ms Jackson over dating website Fling.com. The court heard Ms Jackson moved Muir into her home shortly after they met but their relationship had deteriorated rapidly in the weeks before her death. During a series of text messages from that time messages showed the couple had argued and she had goaded him about having another lover. Muir claimed in the first recording he made on his mobile phone after the killing that 'things went wrong', and Ms Jackson had ordered him out of her house. 'Nine years for a man that’s capable of killing someone and burying them on the moors - there’s no justice' - Andrew Jackson . He then said on the tape: 'She were like a bloody devil. She got my knife and tried attacking me with it, and I got it off her and shoved her down and she hurt her head and that. 'I can’t explain, but it were a disaster and I’m heartbroken. I can’t live. I can’t live anymore.' During the second recording, Muir speaks about money and talks of killing himself. In the third, Muir speaks of Ms Jackson, whom he called Chrissie, and said: 'I love Chrissie to bits, but she isn’t here now and I did a terrible thing.' Geoff Mason, spokesperson for the Crime Prosecution Service North East, said after the sentencing: 'We are satisfied that Adrian Muir has been held accountable for his actions earlier this year and that justice has been done. 'Since killing Pamela Jackson in March he has acted utterly without remorse. Muir was arrested and charged with murder just days after the grandmother and mother-of-three was reported missing . 'Muir fabricated Facebook entries to convince others she was alive and lied to her sons about their mother’s whereabouts. Throughout a series of lengthy interviews with the police he denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, her death. 'He continued to lie in the face of the huge volume of forensics and telecommunications evidence linking him to Soyland Moor where Pamela was found and, at trial, even made wild accusations of a conspiracy against him in his efforts to evade justice. 'Each and every one of his actions has been motivated by a cowardly sense of self-preservation, with little concern for the impact they would have on the family and friends of Pamela Jackson. 'His actions have greatly extended the suffering and grief of those who loved Pamela, simply to serve his own selfish ends. 'The recovery of Pamela’s body was only achieved as a result of the determination and dedication of the Durham Police who refused to give up until she was found and her body returned to her family. 'We hope that Pamela’s family are satisfied with the sentence passed on Muir today and we extend our deepest sympathies to them at what must be a very difficult time.' Ms Jackson's nephew Paul Gilroy said: 'The past six months can only be described as horrendous and heart wrenching for our family, and no question the hardest thing we ever had to deal with. 'We feel a sense of injustice for Pamela. No amount of time behind bars will compensate our loss.' Ms Jackson’s sister, Deborah Leighton, 51, said: 'If he had admitted it in the first place he wouldn’t have put the family through such pain.' Another of Ms Jackson’s sisters, Marion Elsinor, 52, said: 'She was very loving, very loving to her family. She loved her children. The family get a life sentence.'","Adrian Muir has been jailed for 18 years for manslaughter of girlfriend .

"A potentially historic Nor’easter is churning its way toward the Northeast with potential hurricane force wind gusts and blizzard conditions dumping as much as two feet of snow in some places on Friday and Saturday. While the actual trajectory for the storm is still unknown, New York City could get around 10 inches and Boston could get slammed with as much as two feet with winds gusts up to 55 mph. A blizzard watch is now in effect starting Friday morning for much of Eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island with travel not recommended amid fears of dangerous white out conditions, the National Weather Service reports. Scroll down for video . Snowbelt: The East Coast could get hit with up to 12 inches of snow as a powerful system moves east . Variations on a storm: However, other weather prediction services show that the majority of the storm will be further north . Path: By Friday evening at 7pm the storm is projected to be just off the eastern coast of New Jersey as depicted by NOAA here . Knee deep: An accumulated snow forecast from Intellicast shows one storm system coming across the Midwest into the East Coast . The National Weather Service is forecasting 'a potential historic winter storm and blizzard' in Boston while issuing a blizzard watch throughout the area from Friday until Saturday afternoon. They . report the heaviest snow to begin falling on Friday night into Saturday morning . with 2-3 inches per hour possible and visibility less than a quarter of a . mile or less at times. Just south, most of New York state is under its own winter storm watch with snow likely to begin falling by early Friday morning and develop into heavier snowfall . throughout the afternoon. Heavy rain, snow, and wind gusts possibly more than 50 mph are . expected throughout Metro New York, Long Island, Connecticut and up into . Orange county, New Jersey creating fears of . potential power outages in freezing conditions and drifting and blowing snow making roads . impassable according to NOAA. 'As always in the winter season we are prepared for whatever Mother Nature brings,' New York Sanitation Dept. spokesman Keith Mellis told the New York Post of their 365 salt-spreaders standing by. 'Once we get a weather forecast that looks like the threat of snow, we have them pre-loaded. They’re our first line of defense,' he said. Widespread minor flooding and . moderate flooding along shoreline communities is also expected, . potentially causing moderate to significant beach erosion among some of . the hardest hit areas less than four months after Hurricane Sandy. The Weather Channel reports that the Midwestern storm pattern, which passed through Chicago and Milwaukee, will mix with wetter weather coming from New Orleans, Louisville, and even Atlanta. Bundling up: On Friday snow, seen in blue, is expected to blanket parts of the northeast while accompanying patches of ice, seen in pink and purple . Salt of the Earth: Municipal trucks fill up with salt Wednesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in preparations for what could be a large snowfall . Weekend forecast: A 25-hour snow map released by NOAA shows the northeast for February 9 through the 10th with the region easily seen hit the hardest . Days ahead: A weather map shows the projected snowfall across the northeast for the next 48 hours before the start of Friday's storm . By Thursday night, forecasts predict that the clipper system will travel from the Great Lakes region to the East Coast, passing through Philadelphia, New York, and up towards Boston. Buffalo and Albany are also under the threat of significant snowfall, according to the NOAA. But other weather forecasters say that there will be little accumulation in New York and Philadelphia, instead forecasting rain and sleet. The contrasting situation of monstrous proportions - causing some to estimate seeing 38-inches of snow dumped on New york City - rests on the interaction between a small weather system near Chicago and another off the Carolina coast that has yet to form, the WSJ reports. If the two storms merge the massive snow fall is expected to pound the full northeast area. If it misses one another - even by 50 miles - the storm would be expected to shift its weight further north, sparing New York City instead with rain and light snow. 'Crunching all that data together inside my little weather brain, I haven’t seen anything that argues convincingly for more than six inches of snow in the five boroughs,' WSJ's Eric Holthaus reports. 'The National Weather Service agrees,' he continues, 'although totals could quickly increase further northward into Connecticut. More likely, the city will get two to five inches of slush mixed with rain.' The runaround: New York has experienced little snowfall this winter, but instead endured a bitter cold snap last month with single-digit temperatures . Blanketed: A horse grazes in a snow-covered field in Akron, New York on Monday, an area expected to see 6-12-inches of snow come Friday . Moving in: An NOAA satellite image taken Wednesday shows a low pressure system off the eastern United States with a frontal boundary over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic with snow showers . Frigid: A projected map for the U.S. late this week shows temperatures dipping into the single digits in parts of the northeast . Philadelphia is also expected to be hit with 2-4-inches of snow, . beginning overnight on Thursday and continuing into Friday, with rain in . the southern areas of the region. Around Mount Holly, New Jersey, gusts are expected up to 55 mph at the Shore and 40 mph inland. Washington, D.C., which has seen little snowfall this season, will likely get rain. New York City has been largely spared its usual snowfall, which averages at around 25 inches as of February. This year, there has been less than eight inches of snowfall in the city. Last year, too, proved to be a dry winter for New Yorkers, with a similar average accumulation. Similarly Boston has only had 9.6 inches since December 1, putting it 14.3 inches below normal. Earlier this year, much of the country was hit with a vicious cold snap, with punishing winds and Arctic temperatures causing temperatures to plummet well below freezing.","Boston could get up to two feet of snow and New York City about half that in weekend storm as two storm systems merge .

"Bode Miller’s pregnant ex-lover claims she has forwarded messages sent to her by the Olympian’s wife to police as the custody battle over the skier’s unborn child escalates into an extraordinary war between the two women. Miller, 35, launched his fight for joint legal and physical custody of Sara McKenna’s child just days after his wife, Morgan Beck, suffered a miscarriage. Now in an increasingly vitriolic online exchange between McKenna and Miller’s wife of three months,  Beck brands her adversary a woman who lied about being on the Pill ‘to lock down a man who doesn’t want to be with her.’ War of Words: Miller's wife Morgan Beck, left, and his ex-lover Sara McKenna's vicious Twitter war has seen threats of arrest and police involvement . Sara and Morgan pull no punches as one fights for her man and the other fights for her child . Joy: Sara announced her pregnancy on Facebook and proudly revealed what he planned to call the child . McKenna responds, ‘No Morgan, not even the pill is 100% effective when you are having unprotected sex.’ She today told TMZ, 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up my son to somebody who did not want him to begin with.' Messages posted by Beck on January 9 paint McKenna, 35, as a desperate woman who duped Miller by lying about being on the Pill. Beck threatens, ‘there will be a warrant for your arrest for kidnapping the moment you go into labor.’ At one point during the catty exchange McKenna states, ‘Now I’m going to cut this off since I sent your messages to a police officer. Your IP (Internet Provider) address gets tracked. Can’t deny your ID.’ Using the screen name Ana appert isn't enough to disguise Morgan's identity as she threatens her rival . Escalating hostilities: McKenna attempts to silence Beck by bringing in the police . On the slopes: Miller pictured last year - is sitting out this season as he recovers from surgery, but any hopes for a quiet recuperation have been in vain . War: Last week, McKenna, pictured, filed a police report against Beck, claiming online attacks and threatening messages on Twitter . McKenna is due to give birth next month, leaving little time between the conception of her child with Miller and his meeting professional volleyball player, Beck, in May last year. The New Hampshire-born Miller married her five months later in a private ceremony on his boat in San Diego in October. But already the storm with McKenna was brewing. Just weeks before his marriage, she posted, ‘Go take your paternity test already Bode. I’m over the way you have been treating us. You can’t hide DNA in court documents.’ On the same day McKenna posted a message directed at 25-year-old Beck: ‘If you make a fake Twitter to ask me questions about your new “fiance” at least be clever enough not to use your cat’s name #block.’ McKenna, who describes herself as a ‘Firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S Marine, model, Ivy Leaguer and future mommy,’ claims that Miller wanted nothing to do with the child when she first fell pregnant eight months ago. Now she has made it clear that she has no intention of surrendering any rights to the child’s father. In a clear show of solidarity with her husband earlier this month Beck informed McKenna: ‘You are stuck with BOTH of us for the rest of your life.’ Miller has also filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support payments for a child by another woman – Chanel Johnson. Johnson, now married, is the mother of Miller’s four-year-old daughter Neesyn Dacey. According to Miller the two are friends and he was involved in naming the little girl. Miller has won five Olympic medals – including a gold at the 2010 Vancouver Games, holds four World Championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an American men's record. He recently announced his intention to sit this season out as he is recovering from knee surgery and determined to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. 'Trying to be a good parent:' Miller with four-year-old Neesyn Darcey his daughter by Chanel Johnson who is the subject of a custody suit . Writing about his relationship with Johnson and their daughter in his personal journal on Universalsports.com on Friday, Miller insisted that he had never tried to keep the child a secret. ‘If someone asked I would talk about it,’ he said. ‘But no-one ever really brought it up. We were kind of already doing our own thing when Chanel found out she was pregnant. 'We are just really good friends trying to be good parents…I’m happy the way it is.’ The same cannot be said for the situation with McKenna. High flying: The war between helicopter McKenna, left, and Miller's wife, a volleyball player, have become extremely bitter . Her tweets of her pregnancy progress – she has tweeted from the moment of the pregnancy test – must be particularly painful for Beck. She posted the news of her miscarriage on Friday in this very public play by play. The battle's impact on surrounding friendships is also clear. Earlier this month McKenna could be found lambasting a friend for a perceived betrayal. Yet only a few months before the women were excitedly exchanging details of the impending birth and telilng the world how delighted they were to be friends. Collateral damage: Former friendships are falling by the wayside as McKenna pits herself against Miller and Beck . In September @Tehren_Anaiis tweets, 'i . am so honoured to know such an amazing strong woman like . @Sarah_A_McKenna can't wait to meet little bode babe!' But only last month McKenna is accusing her friend of a 'back stab' by feeding information to Beck. McKenna's agent did not respond to requests for comment.","Model Sara McKenna is expecting Olympian's baby next month - he will fight her in court for custody .

"Think you can come up with a Champions League last 16 dream team picking one player from each side? Harder than it might, initially, sound. As Europe’s elite competition moves into the knock-out stages, Sportsmail has endeavoured to devise the best squad - 11 players plus five substitutes - from all 16 remaining teams. The only rule is that only one player from each team can be chosen. Goalkeeper: Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) Without doubt Neuer is the best goalkeeper on the planet and there is no competition for a place between the sticks when he is involved. Conceded just four goals in Bayern Munich’s six tough group stage games against Manchester City, Roma and CSKA Moscow. Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer has firmly established himself as the best goalkeeper in the world . Right-back: Benedikt Howedes (Schalke) The Schalke captain and World Cup winner with Germany makes it in at right back. Howedes, who played every single minute of the World Cup in Brazil, can play consummately across the back four and has been one of the stand-out defenders in the Champions League this season. Benedikt Howedes (centre) has been a mainstay in the right back position for Schalke this season . Centre-back: Vincent Kompany (Manchester City) There are few better in world football at the heart of a defence than Manchester City captain Kompany. There were a number of City attacking options who narrowly missed out on selection - Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero were two strong contenders - but Kompany’s presence at the back earned him a place. Captain Vincent Kompany (left) remains a rock at the heart of the Manchester City defence . Centre-back: Thiago Silva (Paris Saint-Germain) Silva was practically the whole of Brazil’s defence in the World Cup. They conceded seven in five games with him in the side, then seven in one game without him as they were crushed by Germany in the semi-final. He has continued that form for Paris Saint-Germain and has been their best defender this season. Thiago Silva (left) continues to show why Brazil missed him so much in the World Cup semi-final last summer . Left-back: Alex Sandro (Porto) The Brazilian was the best left-back in the group stages. Subject to scouting from Manchester United and Chelsea, he is a threat going forward with his pace and crossing ability and equally strong defensively. Alex Sandro (right) in action against Moreirense's Diogo Cunha during a Portuguese Premier League match . Central midfield: Paul Pogba (Juventus) The 21-year-old is one of the hottest properties in the game. Comfortable in attack and defence, he would sit alongside Matic but remain the more offensive of the central, holding midfielders. Pogba is prone to making astonishing things happen on the pitch. Paul Pogba has been in scintillating form for Juventus this season and is the driving force in midfield . Central midfield: Nemanja Matic (Chelsea) Every attack-minded team needs a midfielder prepared to sit in front of the back four and act as a shield, and Matic has proven this season at Chelsea he is formidable in that role. The tall Serbian is phenomenal at breaking up opposition play with tackles and interceptions. Nemanja Matic has established himself as Chelsea's tour de force in their midfield since re-joining the club . Attacking midfield centre: Lionel Messi (Barcelona) Messi is told he is not the world’s best player, instead the accolade going to Ronaldo last month, so he replies with 14 goals in eight games including two hat-tricks. He is another who is an obvious choice, in behind the striker, in this side. Lionel Messi shows no sign of slowing as he spearheads the Barcelona team at home and abroad . Attacking midfield right: Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid) The Ballon d’Or winner is a cert for his favoured right wing position. His 38 goals in 35 games this season, and the fact him not scoring for the past three games is verging on crisis, says it all. There is no contest. Cristiano Ronaldo is bidding to win his second consecutive Champions League trophy with Real Madrid . Attacking midfield left: Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can’t stop purring over his new signing and he is unquestionably their strongest player since his move from Barcelona in the summer. In a competition with a plethora of potential forward players, the Chilean just makes it in on the left of the attacking midfield trio. Alexis Sanchez hit the ground running for Arsenal when he arrived from Barcelona and has not slowed down . Striker: Luiz Adriano (Shakhtar) Unexpectedly, a Shakhtar Donetsk player is leading the line. Adriano cannot be overlooked after his nine goals in the group stage helped the Ukrainian club through to the last 16 and put him top of the scoring charts. He also had a hand in six other goals, playing a part in every single goal his side scored. How our Champions League dream team lines up . Substitutes . Goalkeeper: Danijel Subasic (Monaco) Almost made it into the starting XI after conceding just one goal in the six group stage matches. That’s five clean sheets. Remarkable. Centre back: Sokratis (Borussia Dortmund) The Greek defender has been immense at the back for the Bundesliga side in Europe, despite their struggles in the Bundesliga, and even weighed-in with a goal in the last round of the Champions League. Centre back: Emir Spahic (Leverkusen) Spahic was at centre of one of the leanest defences in the tournament so far, conceding just four goals, and was one of the form players of the group stages. Attacking midfield: Koke (Atletico Madrid) Hard to leave Koke out of the first team, and not to include one of last year’s finalists, but he has been arguably their best player and there were too many stronger players ahead of him. Forward: Breel Embolo (FC Basel) The exciting teenager from Cameroon, who only turned 18 two days ago, has already scored six in nine league starts for the Swiss side including a Champions League goal to his name against Ludogorets.","Sportsmail has picked the ultimate Champions League last 16 side .

It is understood he had dreams of being a lawyer to make a difference for members of the indigenous community suffering from social injustices. The accused, Mr Zandipour, fronted Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday morning. His lawyer George Defteros said he was an ANZ investment banker who had never found himself in such circumstances before. Family members of the accused murderer Kyle Zandipour leave the Melbourne Magistrates Court after the ANZ investment banker was charged with the murder of Joshua Robert Hardy in Melbourne on Sunday . He said Mr Zandipour approached the homicide squad voluntarily on Saturday and participated in a lengthy interview.

Another man, who was identified in CCTV footage at the fast food outlet moments before the assault, has provided a statement to police but will not face any charges. The court heard allegations during an out-of-sessions court hearing that Mr Zandipour and the second man had been drinking and playing video games at the accused home before entering the fast-food restaurant and purchasing a meal. Detective Senior Constable Julio Salerno then told the hearing that Mr Hardy 'staggered' up to their table, 'apparently inebriated', before sitting with them, The Herald Sun reports. The three men had a conversation and when Mr Zandipour and the other man stood to leave, . Senior Constable Salerno said Mr Hardy appeared to attempt to trip Mr Zandipour which then led to a fight. Mr Zandipour then 'used his arm to hook the deceased under his armpits and flip him' upside down, Constable Salerno claimed according to the Herald Sun.

"A former Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in a shooting spree at an army base in Texas has reportedly written a letter to the Pope praising Islamist jihad. Nidal Hasan, who opened fire at Fort Hood on fellow service personnel at Fort Hood in 2009, has apparently composed the letter under the acronym SoA, thought to mean Soldier of Allah. It is believed he has now directed his attorney John Galligan to send on the six-page, handwritten letter to Pope Francis. Scroll down for video . Nidal Hasan, the former Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in a shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas. He has now wrote a letter to the Pope, where he praises Islamic jihad . The letter, written by Hasan for the Pontiff, pictured, is reportedly entitled 'A Warning to Pope Francis, Members of the Vatican and Other Religious Leaders Around The World' According to Fox News, who have seen the letter, it is entitled 'A Warning to Pope Francis, Members of The Vatican, and Other Religious Leaders Around the World.' In a subsection titled, Jihad, he praises 'The willingness to fight for All-Mighty Allah'. He also states that 'fighters... have a greater rank in the eyes of Allah than believers who don't fight.' Mr Galligan says the letter reinforces how religious zeal underscores his actions and mental processes. However families of the victims say it is clear that Hasan is trying to use jihad as a way of justifying the Fort Hood tragedy. The letter comes just over a month after it was reported that Hasan also wrote to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Hasan had previously written a letter to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying it would be an honour to join the caliphate . In it he said that it would be an 'an honor' to join the caliphate and has made request to be made a 'citizen' of the Islamic State. Hasan is currently on death row at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas after the shooting on November 5, killing 13 and injuring 30 others. During the incident he walked into the Fort Hood medical readiness building carrying two guns and several magazines of ammunition. He shouted 'Allahu Akbar!' - Arabic for 'God is great!' - and opened fire on soldiers awaiting medical tests and vaccines.

Mourners at a memorial service to remember those who died during the gun attack. The families of Fort Hood victims say Hasan is trying to use jihad as a way of justifying the Fort Hood tragedy .

Hasan described himself at trial as a soldier who 'switched sides' in a supposed war between America and Islam. Government lawyers also said Hasan did not want to go on an impending deployment to Afghanistan. Earlier this year FBI Director James Comey testified that he believed the shooting carried out by Hasan at Fort Hood in Texas was inspired by al-Qaeda. The federal government has termed the attack an incidence of 'workplace violence,' saying that the home-grown Hasan didn't meet the legal definition of an international terrorist.","Nidal Hassan has reportedly written a letter intended for Pope Francis .

"When the FA elected to ban Chelsea striker Diego Costa for three matches after his stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can nobody would have expected it to be good news for the Blues. But three games on, Chelsea have extended their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League to seven points - and manager Jose Mourinho has a fully-fit striker with a point to prove, raring to go in their Champions League last-16 tie. Chelsea travel to Paris on Monday to face Paris Saint-Germain, and first-choice forward Costa looked delighted to be making his return to action in their last training session in London.

Cesc Fabregas played a full part in the training session and is expected to return to the base of Chelsea's midfield alongside Nemanja Matic after his substitute appearance in the 1-0 win over Everton last Tuesday. Costa will be a combative presence upfront in direct competition with former Chelsea star David Luiz and his partner Thiago Silva - and Silva has been talking up the contest with the Premier League's top goalscorer ahead of the first leg. 'Diego Costa is one of the top strikers in Europe at the moment. He can play, but also he can do battle as well,' Silva said. 'That is no problem, that is the reason you want to play at this level, to do battle against the best players in the world.

"Men and women who trap their partners in a cycle of emotional cruelty would be prosecuted and jailed under tough new laws proposed by ministers. In a dramatic shake-up, Home Secretary Theresa May today launched a consultation on creating a specific criminal offence of domestic abuse. Police and prosecutors would be expected to take action against those who trap their partners in a ‘living hell’ through a campaign of psychological and financial control. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, is planning tough new laws against domestic violence . People who bully their partners by verbally abusing them, controlling their money or isolating them from friends and family could find themselves hauled before the courts. At the moment, domestic abuse is widely taken to refer to acts of physical violence, and usually prosecuted under charges including assault, battery and actual bodily harm. Controlling, threatening and intimidating behaviour can be covered by stalking and harassment legislation, but this is difficult to prosecute when it applies to intimate relationships, such as a husband and wife who live together. Mrs May believes it does not properly protect victims who suffer ‘terrible’ non-violent harm, including coercive, threatening or intimidating behaviour, often for years, at the hands of so-called loved ones. Research has shown that 30 per cent – or 5million – women and 16 per cent of men, around 2.5million, will experience domestic abuse during their lives. Campaigners who work to tackle domestic abuse welcomed the proposals, which would carry a maximum prison sentence of five years. Polly Neate, chief executive of Women’s Aid, said: ‘This is a vital step forward for victims of domestic violence. ‘In our experience of working with survivors, coercive, controlling behaviour is at the heart of the most dangerous abuse.’ She said changes would ‘give victims greater confidence to speak out sooner, and perpetrators of domestic violence are identified and dealt with more swiftly and effectively.’ Rhea Gargour, of the Sara Charlton Charitable Foundation, which campaigns for vulnerable women, said: ‘Psychological abuse, coercive control and patterns of abuse must be criminalised to ensure that the definition of domestic violence is enforceable in law. It will send out a clear message that this type of violence will not be tolerated.’ Mrs May said: ‘The Government is clear that abuse is not just physical. It is an appalling crime. Victims who are subjected to a living hell by their partners must have the confidence to come forward. ‘It is the worst possible violation of the trust that those in close relationships place in one another. It shatters the lives of its victims and, in some cases, leads to tragic and untimely deaths.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘This is not about a couple having a row with each other on an evening. It is about people whose lives are being controlled, who suffer a systematic pattern of intimidation and threats. ‘A person might not be beaten up but they might still be living with an abusive partner who won’t allow them to leave the house or speak to their friends which means they are living in fear.’ Last year, 269,700 instances of domestic abuse were investigated by police, according to a Home Office consultation document. Last year, police received reports of  270,000 instances of domestic abuse according to  Home Office figures . Of these, around 96,000 – one in three – were assaults which involved an injury. Some 77 women were murdered by partners or ex-partners in 2013. Prosecutions for domestic violence in Britain nearly tripled from 35,000 in 2005 to 103,000 last year, and the conviction rate increased from 46 per cent to 74 per cent. But the Government is still concerned that the police and other agencies are not treating the problem seriously enough. A report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) earlier this year found thousands of domestic violence victims were being ‘failed’ by police forces across England and Wales. Poor attitudes, ineffective training and inadequate evidence-gathering were all heavily criticised by the watchdog, which called for an urgent shake-up of the response to domestic abuse. The consultation, which will last eight weeks, said: ‘Put simply, police officers failed to see domestic abuse as a serious crime.’ Last year, ministers broadened the definition of domestic abuse as ‘any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality’. It will say this can encompass ‘psychological, physical, sexual, financial and emotional’ control. The Government has also introduced ‘Clare’s Law’, named after a woman who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009, which allows the police to disclose information about previous violent offending by a partner. And the Home Office brought in measures to force domestic abusers to leave their homes for up to 28 days to allow their partners the chance to seek help.","Home Secretary Theresa May considering a new offence of 'domestic abuse'

"One in four homeowners say they will be in financial trouble when interest rates rise, according to research. A study found seven per cent believed they would be in ‘serious difficulties’ if their mortgage repayments increased, while 20 per cent would be in ‘slight’ financial trouble. The report, published by the Building Societies Association and the Money Advice Trust, also found that a fifth will be forced to cut back on essentials like clothing and food, while two-fifths will spend less on holidays and eating out. One in four homeowners said they would be in financial trouble when interest rates rise and seven per cent believed they would face 'serious difficulties' in making repayments . The study found 12 per cent will have to work longer hours to keep up with repayments and six per cent will have to move to a cheaper property. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has signalled that the base rate, frozen at a historic low of 0.5 per cent since 2009, could be ‘beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually’. While the Bank says any rise would be ‘gradual and limited’, research shows that many who took out their loans when interest rates were low may struggle to meet higher monthly repayments. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ‘After all these years, mortgage-payers are in for a big financial shock when interest rates begin to rise. ‘For many, that shock will be too much to absorb – and there is a real risk that we will see a surge in unmanageable debt problems as a result. ‘Our message to borrowers is clear – interest rates will rise and that day is coming soon, so now is the time to prepare. ‘Draw up a budget, speak to your lender, and if you do find yourself struggling to repay, seek free debt advice as early as possible.’ The YouGov poll surveyed more than 2,000 mortgage borrowers. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has signalled that the base rate, frozen since 2009 could be 'beginning to increase' by spring . Paul Broadhead, head of mortgage policy at the Building Societies Association, warned that ‘many consumers are only used to a low rate environment’. He said: ‘These results indicate the sensitivity of people’s monthly spending to changes in general household expenditure, indicating that as mortgage rates rise this could have a significant impact on economic recovery. ‘Whilst most mortgage rates are not linked quite so directly to the base rate as they used to be, rates will rise as it increases.’ While some homeowners said they planned to work more hours to earn extra money if rates rose, Mr Broadhead said this ‘may not be within their control’. He added: ‘Our advice to those concerned about interest rate rises is to start thinking about how they will manage the increased costs.’ The study found 12 per cent will have to work longer hours to keep up with repayments and six per cent will have to move to a cheaper property . This month, two members of the Bank’s rate-setting committee voted for a second time in favour of a base rate rise. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty said the Bank needed to act now in order to pre-empt wage and inflationary pressures ahead, but were out-voted by the other seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee. It is thought the Bank will wait until it sees stronger signs of wage growth before increasing the rate. The pay rise for the average worker increased by just 0.7 per cent over the last year, less than half the current rate of inflation at 1.5 per cent. Tory MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee in the Commons, recently suggested a premature rise in interest rates would be a catastrophe for millions of families. He said: ‘There is definitely a feeling now that interest rates will start to rise. When the day comes there will be households holed below the water line, and they will be in trouble. ‘The problem is that there is a huge amount of household debt in the country. People have forgotten that 0.5 per cent is an emergency level of interest rates. It is not normal at all. ‘If you are a saver, rising interest rates are fantastic. If you are a borrower it is bad news and for those that are already struggling, or close to struggling, raising interest rates will be a catastrophe.’ With rates tipped to rise, some homeowners might find it's worth paying the charge to leave a mortgage deal early in order to lock in to low interest offers for the longer term. There are some decent five or even six year fixes currently available, which will enable you to make the most of manageable rates, despite the predicted hikes.

"A violent predator killed his girlfriend days after he was released from prison without supervision. Felipe Lopes, who had been jailed for assaulting another woman, was freed on condition that he saw mental health workers every day. Yet, despite failing to make a single appointment over two weeks, the 28-year-old was left alone to beat his Russian lover to death with a hockey stick. By then neighbours had already reported two attacks on 23-year-old Anastasia Voykina. Killer: Felipe Lopes (left) beat Anastasia Voykina (right) to death after a row over a Christmas present . As Lopes was sentenced yesterday, authorities faced serious questions over their failure to monitor him despite his six years of assaults on women. He was first reported to police for attacking a girlfriend in 2006 and, two years later, broke into her family home and threatened her with a knife as she lay in bed. He was given a community order for the assault but continued to stalk her for three years, warning probation officers he might kill her. The Portuguese national attacked her once more while she was in bed, biting her chest, punching her in the face, beating her with a belt and kicking her. He was spared jail for the assault but started a relationship with another woman and stabbed her – for which he was given yet another suspended sentence and a restraining order. He was eventually jailed for 12 weeks after tracking her down and assaulting her. Lopes was released from Belmarsh Prison last December but – despite the requirement to report to his mental health team on a daily basis – he was not seen over the Christmas period and staff did not track him down or report him missing. Happier times: Anastasia Voykina, pictured on the beach, loved Lopes and wanted to help him, the court heard . Living with Miss Voykina in a flat in Streatham, south-west London, he refused to take medication for his schizoid defective disorder and became increasingly violent. Police were called to the flat twice after neighbours heard attacks so loud the whole building was vibrating. Nothing was done however. The Old Bailey was told Miss Voykina had moved in with Lopes because she was ‘idealistic’ and wanted to help him with his problems. But, following an argument over a Christmas gift on or around December 29, Lopes sexually assaulted Miss Voykina with an umbrella and battered her in the face up to 60 times with a hockey stick before dragging her to the bath, where she was left in a pool of her own blood. She is believed to have survived for about an hour and her body lay in the flat for ten days. Lopes’s support team reported him missing when they returned from annual leave in early January. Miss Voykina was killed in a flat in Streatham, south London (pictured: a general view of the street) By then Miss Voykina’s family in Russia had called the police, who broke into the flat and found her body. ‘No one saw the defendant for a period of days over the holidays,’ prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC said. ‘The mental health team returned from leave and were unable to trace him and were about to report him missing.’ Judge Richard Marks told Lopes: ‘There is no doubt in my mind you intended to kill her. You are and will remain for an indefinite time a significantly dangerous man, particularly to women.’ He sentenced Lopes, who admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility because of his mental health problems, to life with a minimum term of seven years and three months. He could be free when he is 35. Lopes was made subject to an order under Section 45a of the Mental Health Act so he will be detained in hospital until he is well enough to go to prison.A police spokesman said officers twice visited the flat but no allegations were made. Jail: Lopes, 28, committed previous domestic abuse and served a jail term at Belmarsh Prison in east London .","Felipe Lopes, 28, beat lover to death in their flat in south London .

'[It's] a declaration that I'm a . little nervous about – but maybe not quite as nervous as my publicist . right now. I'm just going to put it out there – loud and proud.' She paused and asked the crowd for support before finally saying: 'I am single.' She received a boost from her close friend Mel Gibson, who offered a wolf-whistle from her table in the audience.

In a moment that moved most in the audience to tears, she paid tribute to her 84-year-old mother, . Evelyn 'Brandy' Almond, who suffers from dementia. She said: 'I love you, I love you, I love you and I hope if I say this three . times, it will magically and perfectly enter into your soul, fill you . with grace and the joy of knowing that you did good in this life.'

She appeared to hint at retirement at . the close of her speech, saying: 'This feels like the end of one era . and the beginning of something else – scary and exciting.' Backstage, the star denied she was . stepping away from the public eye, adding: 'Oh no, I could never stop . acting. You'd have to drive me behind a team of horses.' Miss Foster publicly hinted at her . sexuality for the first time in 2007 when she paid tribute to 'my . beautiful Cydney' at Women in Entertainment event - referring to her then partner Bernard. The former couple met on the set of the film Sommersby in 1993 and had two sons. Miss Foster has never revealed the identity of the father or the circumstances of their conception. As with most questions about her personal life, the actress has refused to comment on gossip that the father was an old university friend from Yale, who is also gay. Miss Foster landed her first job in a sun cream commercial when she was three years old and appeared in 50 films before she left school, including her shocking breakthrough role as a child prostitute in Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro. She became one of the most successful adult stars in Hollywood by taking on gutsy roles like rape victim Sarah Tobias in The Accused in 1988 and Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs three years later, both of which won her Best Actress Oscars.

"Donald Sterling is currently preparing to duke it out with the NBA to keep his Los Angeles Clippers team, but he may also soon face another legal issue - this time from the IRS. That's because Sterling's mother and grandmother have been paying property taxes on two LA residences since 2001, even though both have been dead for decades. A new report in  USA Today suggests 80-year-old Sterling and his sister Marilyn Pizante, 73, have kept their childhood home and a property across the street in their mother and grandmother's names and have avoided a reassessment that would increase their property taxes by several thousand dollars. A new report by USA Today finds that two property's in Donald Sterling's old neighborhood - including his childhood home - are in the name of his mother and grandmother, women who have been dead for decades . Sterling's mother Sora Tokowitz gained ownership of the two properties in her divorce from Sterling's father Louis Tokowitz in 1959, and went on to live in one of the properties for 30 years as landlady. It's unclear how, but at some point Sterling's paternal grandmother Sarah Chasa Tokovitz became the legal owner of the childhood home, though no tenants recognize her name. Sterling's mother died sometime in the 80s while his grandmother died in 1966 in Chicago. According to California law, both women's deaths should have been reported to the LA County Assessor's Office within 150 days, so that the properties could be reassessed for market value and mostly likely, a tax increase instated. Sterling's paternal grandmother who died in 1966 is the registered owner of his childhood home, pictured above . Sterling's mother Sora Tokowitz is still the registered owner on this multi-tenant building located just across the street. However, she died sometime in the 1980s . But neither death seems to have been reported since both properties are still in the deceased women's names. In 2013, $603.66 was paid in property taxes on Sterling's childhood home while $1,545.11 was paid on the property across the street in his mother's name. Neither property has been reassessed since 1978 and would be worth today a combined $13,000 in property taxes. Since 2001, LA County has received 49 money orders in either women's names, paying these property taxes. Sterling is worth an estimated $1.9billion according to Forbes and owns hundreds of properties in the Los Angeles area, from low-income apartments to the lux Sterling Plaza in Beverly Hills. Billionaire: Sterling started his career as a lawyer but made his money as a California real estate mogul. He owns hundreds of properties across the Los Angeles area from low-income housing to hte Sterling Plaza in Beverly Hills, pictured above . He made headlines last month when the NBA banned him from the league for life and hit him with a $2.5 million fine for making racist comments in recordings reportedly released by then-girlfriend V. Stiviano. They are also trying to force him to sell the team. But most tenants at the facility remember dealing with Sterling's mother and sister as their landladies over the years. Sterling's mother Sora was so beloved by her tenants that they let her eat their food. That changed with Sora's death in the '80s, when Marilyn Pizante showed up claiming the two properties were hers now. Sterling's mother Sora Tokowitz won the two properties in her divorce from Sterling's father Louis in the 50s. Sterling himself is currently starting divorce proceedings with his estranged with Shelly (pictured above at a Clippers game on May 15, with lawyer Pierce O'Donnell) The Navarette family, who lived at one of the properties for 30 years, was evicted in 2005 and went to court with Pizante. While most tenants remember either Sora or her daughter Pizante as their landlady, Donald Sterling himself was caught on the properties a few times. Danny Vallejo, Maria Vallejo's son, remembers a day in May 2012 when Donald and a woman he now recognizes as girlfriend V. Stiviano were taking pictures of the newly-painted properties. Former girlfriend: A former tenant remembers Sterling visiting the properties in 2012 with a woman he now recognizes as V. Stiviano. Stiviano pictured above at a night club on the night of May 17 . At one point, Sterling tried to open the gate into the backyard but Stiviano stopped him. 'No, no, honey, you can't go in there. You need a permit,' Stiviano said. 'She just hugged him and kissed him... I could hear everything,' Danny recalls. Shortly after Sterling's visit, a for-sale sign popped up on the front lawn of own of the properties but was soon inexplicably removed.","Donald Sterling's childhood home and a property across the street are listed in his grandmother and mother's names .

The 34-year-old was born with an in-body brewery that went undetected for 20 years meaning he spent years being 'drunk' after eating highly starchy or sugary foods - even when he was at primary school. Scroll down for video . Matthew Hogg (pictured with his girlfriend, Mandy Taylor), 33, has auto-brewery syndrome - an overgrowth of yeast in his small intestine produces alcohol every time he eats anything sugary or starchy . The strength of the alcohol his body produces is so powerful that he suffers a hangover every morning and has chronic alcohol poisoning and liver disease. As a result, he is often bed-bound and suffers from exhaustion. Teetotal Mr Hogg, of Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, said: ‘Every time I eat bread, potatoes or starchy rice I produce 100 per cent proof drinking alcohol that travels around my body through my bloodstream - if I eat a portion of rice I would suffer a hangover equivalent of having glugged three bottles of red wine the night before. ‘I have experienced symptoms from birth and during my childhood there were countless times I suffered 'drunkenness' without having consumed an alcoholic beverage. ‘I was a stubborn teenager and wanted a normal life so I insisted on partying and drinking and after sailing through my GCSEs I had to scrape through my A-levels to go to university. ‘But soon after starting I dropped out - I had noticed I was getting drunk more easily and was suffering severe hangovers after most meals. Mr Hogg (pictured with his partner, Mandy) has to stick to a very natural diet of meat, fish, vegetables and nuts. Even when on this diet, he wakes up with a hangover every morning . ‘Drinking alcohol is now a big no - I already have my own personal brewery and the body was not designed to handle even more alcohol. ‘Plus, why pay someone else when I can make my own special brew.’ Mr Hogg suffers from auto-brewery syndrome, where an overgrowth of yeast in his small intestine produces pure ethanol that is then absorbed directly into the bloodstream. The condition is aggravated by eating processed food or those which are starchy and sugary. To manage the condition, he has to stick to a very natural diet of meat, fish and vegetables. Due to the huge quantity of alcohol in Mr Hogg's body, he suffers from chronic alcohol poisoning and has liver disease. This means he is often bed-ridden and exhausted . However, he experiences some symptoms even on this diet. While studying for his A-levels, Mr Hogg’s condition became more severe and he would often experience 'drunken' affects, such as dizziness, nausea and even aggression, during classes. He said: ‘I would start feeling intoxicated a few hours after having something to eat as my body began digesting it. ‘I'm usually quite a shy and quiet person and had a lot of friends at school, but there were times when I would act like a raging drunk by saying horrible things to people, slurring words, upsetting people and just stirring up trouble. Mr Hogg has suffered from the condition since he was a child (pictured) and struggled at school as he often experienced symptoms of drunkenness, such as nausea, dizziness and aggression . ‘My parents were baffled by my behaviour. I had always been a quiet, sensible child and even as a teenager I was never prone to being moody or stroppy. ‘But suddenly I started acting like Kevin the teenager, from Harry Enfield and chums.’ The complexity of Mr Hogg’s condition baffled NHS doctors, who insisted he visit a psychiatrist as a result of regularly missing school. But he eventually sought private help from specialists in London and Mexico. His family spent their entire £50,000 savings trying to have Matthew's condition identified and it wasn't until a blood test showed abnormally high levels of ethanol and other alcohols present, indicating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, that a diagnosis was made. It was years before Mr Hogg was diagnosed - the condition was only picked up when a blood test revealed he had high levels of ethanol in his blood even though he had not been drinking . Mr Hogg added: ‘I finally recognised I'd been suffering auto-brewery syndrome all these years after reading a book about a Japanese man who was arrested by police for drunk-driving despite insisting he was teetotal. ‘It explained that an overgrowth of yeast in the gut could cause this - along with all the symptoms I had suffered for so many years. ‘I now understood that I had my very own brewery in my gut that was poisoning my body and mind.’ The illness has had a devastating impact on Mr Hogg’s life - he is unable to hold down a job and pursue a career as a nutritional therapist. He also has to adhere to a strict diet in order to manage the fermentation in his gut - the vast majority of common foods, drinks and snacks are off the menu, along with fast food and takeaways. Mr Hogg (pictured on holiday with his sister) cannot work because of his illness and he often has too little energy to leave the house . Mr Hogg even went to Mexico (pictured) in his attempt to find a diagnosis and treatment for his condition . Mr Hogg, who lives with girlfriend Mandy Taylor, is forced to stay home as a result of having little or no energy on a daily basis - but he did set up the Environmental Illness Resource website to help fellow sufferers. And 26-year-old Mandy ensures that there are no tempting snacks or banned foods in the cupboards to tease him into breaking his regime. Mr Taylor, a teacher, said: ‘We are able to go out for meals as a couple but not as often as we would both like. ‘I watched other friends in their “normal” relationships and did feel envious of what they had but this made me fight for Matthew and make him realise that his syndrome should not dictate his future happiness. ‘He would never control or tell me what to do but I don't want to sit and eat or have things in the house that would make him feel tempted or negative about the foods he has to stick to. Mr Hogg (pictured, left, with a friend) said: 'Every time I eat bread, potatoes or starchy rice I produce 100 per cent proof drinking alcohol that travels around my body through my bloodstream - if I eat a portion of rice I would suffer a hangover equivalent of having glugged three bottles of red wine the night before' ‘We both enjoy living active lifestyles but due to his condition he isn't able to participate much - so quite often I have to go the gym or do recreational activities alone.’ Mr Hogg’s condition is so severe, that usual treatment procedures of anti-fungal medications, probiotic supplements and selected nutritional supplements do not prevent the production of alcohol. He has been left to manage the level of fermentation himself with only vitamin and minerals to help. He said: ‘We now have no savings left and even if we did are at a loss as to how to regain my health - the most precious gift a human being is endowed with. Mr Hogg (pictured with a friend) says it is frustrating that he has spent thousands of pounds looking for a diagnosis and then a treatment but that he still has no way of curing his condition . ‘I must typically eat a natural diet based on meat, fish, eggs, seeds and vegetables and drink only pure water and herbal teas. ‘This is extremely difficult at first and would no doubt be impossible for most people, yet the consequences of eating a more conventional diet are even worse with a brewery in your gut. ‘It's a frightening amount of money we've spent and the fact I have not been effectively treated as a result is the real kick in the teeth. Auto-brewery syndrome, also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is a rare condition which causes the digestive system to produce alcohol through fermentation. It causes a person to become drunk when they have not consumed alcohol. It is thought to be caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the intestines. Very little is known about the condition but a number of cases have been cited in medical literature.","Matthew Hogg has auto-brewery syndrome - an overgrowth of yeast in his small intestine produces ethanol from sugary and starchy foods .

"A seasoned member of the medical community who has spent 30 years performing autopsies said that the damage done to the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are ‘probably the worst I’ve seen.’ Connecticut Chief state medical examiner H. Wayne Carver II said in a press conference Saturday afternoon in Newtown that in his three decades in practice, the shooting is the ‘worst I know of any of my colleagues having seen.’ Dr Carver said that each of the 26 victims was shot between there and 11 times, with two of the victims being shot at incredibly close range. The bullets had pierced everywhere, he said – heads, extremities, and torsos. Scroll down for video . Connecticut Chief Medical Examiner H.

Kathy Murdy, left, and her husband Rich Murdy react as they look at the list of victims of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting . ‘This is a devastating set of injuries,’ he told reporters in the emotionally-charged news conference. Dr Carver’s 10 technicians and four doctors in his office worked tirelessly throughout Friday night and on into Saturday to identify and perform autopsies on the 26 dead. They expect to be done by tomorrow morning, the Hartford Courant reports. He said that 20-year-old shooter Adam Lanza was able to reload extremely quickly during the Friday morning blitz because he taped two magazines together. The shooter mainly used a military-style assault rifle belonging to his mother, Nancy, to carry out the horrific massacre. Dr Carver went on to say that most of Lanza’s victims were first graders, between the ages of six and seven. Parents were allowed to identify their children through pictures, a process intended to minimize shock, he said. The victims of the shooting were shot multiple times by semiautomatic rifle, the medical examiner said Saturday, and he called the injuries 'devastating' A girl and a woman place angel wings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School sign in Newtown on Saturday .

Dr Carver said that he will personally perform an autopsy on the suspected gunman on Sunday, as well as his mother, Nancy, 52, who was shot dead in her upscale Newtown home. The shooter’s father, Peter Lanza, today issued a statement detailing the grief his family is going through. It reads: ‘Our hearts go out to the families and friends who lost loved ones and to all those who were injured. Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. ‘No words can truly express how heartbroken we are. We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can. ‘We too are asking why. We have cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so. 'Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired.' Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy said in a televised address Saturday afternoon that in instances like this, there is little sense to be made. ‘There's precious little anyone can say to the families that will lessen the horror and sense of loss they feel.

"They are vital ingredients of a traditional Christmas dinner. But a former school dinner lady has found an alternative festive use for Brussels sprouts, parsnips, chestnuts, carrots and cranberries, which she hopes will help her become one of the nation’s favourite bakers. The ‘Christmas Dinner Cake’ is the latest bizarre creation of cake-making entrepreneur Allison Whitmarsh, who has gone from strength to strength after appearing on the BBC’s Dragon’s Den programme almost a year ago. Bizarre: The 'Christmas Dinner Cake' contains sprouts, parsnips, chestnuts, carrots and cranberries . Mother-of-two Miss Whitmarsh, 46, successfully pitched her unusual cake on the Christmas show and secured £50,000 funding from Dragon Deborah Meaden in return for a 25 per cent stake in her business. The cake, which includes almost everything on the Christmas dinner plate apart from Turkey and gravy, is now available through the online supermarket Ocado for £18. Her Huddersfield-based company Propermaid hopes to sell 2,000 of the cakes this season.

Unusual: Her cake includes almost everything on the Christmas dinner plate apart from Turkey and gravy . Miss Whitmarsh said: ‘It’s gone down . really well. People dread it at first and then there’s the look of . surprise when they taste it. It’s a sweet cake, a bit like carrot cake.’ Other cake creations from her kitchen have included courgette & lime, beetroot & chocolate, liquorice, dandelion & burdock and chocolate chilli & fudge. ‘We do the traditional cakes too, but I think people want something different,’ she said. Miss Whitmarsh’s transformation from dinner lady to cake entrepreneur began when she received a grant to do a Hospitality Management degree at Huddersfield University. High hopes: Miss Whitmarsh's company Propermaid hopes to sell 2,000 of the cakes this season . She formed her company as part of her degree project and then turned it into a successful business after she graduated in 2008. When she appeared on the Dragon’s Den last December her company had a turnover of around £250,000. With the help of the new funding – which she invested in much-needed equipment – Propermaid has doubled its turnover since. The company now employs 22 people and produces between 200 and 300 cakes a day.

"The family of a four-year-old girl who suffered an allergic reaction on board a flight over the Atlantic Ocean  claims a US carrier refused to accommodate them on their return journey because it is not ‘a nut-free airline.’ The Dublin family was flying to New Jersey when the four-year-old girl went into anaphylactic shock after eating nuts served on the United Airlines flight. She was given a shot of adrenaline by a fellow passenger and the plane was forced to return to Dublin so she could be rushed to hospital. Scroll down for video . A United Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing after a girl suffered an allergic reaction to nuts . However, despite agreeing to fly the family on a nut-free flight to New Jersey following her ordeal, United refused to ban nuts for the whole cabin on the flight carrying the family on their return journey. The allegation comes just days after another four-year-old, Fae Platten, stopped breathing and passed out when she suffered a life-threatening allergy attack on board a flight. She suffered the reaction after a passenger opened a packet of mixed nuts he brought on the plane despite three warnings that there was a child on board with a severe allergy. The young girl was given an injection with her adrenaline pen and taken to hospital after the plane landed. Ryanair, which accommodated the family's request to not serve nuts to passengers, has banned the male passenger from flying with it for two years. The latest story comes after four-year-old Fae Platten (L and R with her family) suffered a severe allergic reaction after a fellow passenger opened a bag of nuts in flight despite repeated warnings against doing so . In contrast, the Irish mother on board the United Airlines flight, who asked not to be identified, said her daughter had never suffered an allergic reaction before, but suffered an extreme response after eating a cashew nut served on the plane. She told the Irish Independent that her daughter's face swelled, she broke out in hives and struggled to breathe. She added: ‘They put out a call for medical personnel and thankfully there happened to be an allergy specialist from Houston, Texas, on board the flight. She came to the front and gave her the adrenaline from a vial.’ The young girl was given an adrenaline injection by an allergy specialist who happened to be on the flight . When the family asked staff not to serve any nuts, they were allegedly told United didn't advertise itself as a 'nut-free airline'. The mother told the Irish Independent: ‘We were only going to discommode 10 other people because we were all in first class. They asked the other people but then a simple request seemed to turn into a big production.’ Staff asked the couple and their young daughter to get off the plane. They spent the night in a hotel while the child’s aunt and grandparents, who accompanied them on the trip, travelled home as scheduled. The couple and their daughter returned to Dublin the following day after United Airlines agreed not to serve any nuts on that flight. The mother said: ‘My daughter was extremely upset by the whole thing, as was I. My husband was angry with how quickly the whole thing escalated from what seemed like a simple request.’ United Airlines said in a statement that it does not serve pre-packaged peanuts on its flights, but some foods may include nuts or contain trace amounts of nut ingredients, or may have been processed in facilities that handle nuts. The statement said: ‘Although we do not serve peanuts on our flights, it's not possible to prevent customers from bringing food items on board that contain peanuts.’ The airline said it encourages passengers to notify a flight attendant if they have a nut allergy. It said: ‘For operational reasons, we cannot remove any onboard products based on individual customer requests, and we do not offer nut-free buffer zones on our aircraft.","Girl went into anaphylactic shock after eating nuts on United Airlines flight .

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has hit out at accusations that his newly affectionate relationship with President Obama could have cost the Republicans the White House. Christie said he was particularly unhappy how the word 'embrace' had been used to describe his teamwork with Obama and the Federal Government in the cleanup effort after Superstorm Sandy. ‘I’m a guy who tells the truth, all the time. And if the president of the United States did something good, I was going to say he did something good and give him credit for it,’ Christie told reporters in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey. Scroll down for video of Christie defending himself against Romney loss accusations . Chris Christie told reporters that he had the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney's candidacy . ‘But it doesn’t take away for a minute the fact that I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney, that I traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him, raised tens of millions of dollars for him and worked harder, I think, than any other surrogate in America other than Paul Ryan.’ In the run up to Tuesday's election, GOP . operatives whined that Christie’s cordial treatment of President Obama, . when he toured Sandy-ravaged neighborhoods of New Jersey, stopped the . Republican’s momentum going into the election. Christie described his critics as . 'know-nothing, disgruntled Romney supporters' who did not respect the . duty he owed to the people of his state. The new-found special relationship between Christie and the President works both ways and Obama  heaped praise on the New Jersey Gov. in his acceptance speech after his re-election Tuesday.

Do your job, don't worry about me. I'll take care of things.""' Christie did not blame Romney, a . former governor of Massachusetts, for the criticism of him, saying: . 'He's been a governor - he knows.' Instead, . he added: 'All this other noise, I think, is coming from know-nothing, . disgruntled Romney staffers who, you know, don't like the fact that I . said nice things about the president of the United States.

"Disturbing: Athena Renee Doyle, 35, has been charged with trying to kill her two young sons by intentionally driving off a 300-foot cliff last month . A Northern California mother is accused of trying to kill her two young sons by intentionally driving off a 300-foot cliff, injuring both children, after ranting online about a conspiracy against her family. Mendocino County sheriff's officials say 35-year-old Athena Renee Doyle was arrested on a warrant in Humboldt County last Friday in connection with the October 3 crash that injured her and her two boys, ages 2 and 4. Ms Doyle is now facing two felony counts of attempted murder. Sheriff's Capt. Greg Van Patten told the Press Democrat of Santa Rosa that an investigation determined Doyle intentionally drove her 1992 Isuzu Rodeo SUV down a 300-foot cliff, where it came to rest on its roof on Chadbourn Gulch/Blues Beach off of Highway 1 north of Fort Bragg. No one was around to witness the crash, and it was not until several hours later, just after 12pm, that California Highway Patrol got a call from a passing motorist about an SUV resting on its roof at the bottom of the hill. Doyle and the boys, 2-year-old Nicodemus Doyle and 4-year-old Isaiah Hacket-Doyle, were airlifted to area hospitals to be treated for injuries. A witness told Lost Coast Outpost that one of the children suffered a broken arm, a broken femur and a head injury. Both boys have since been discharged from the hospital. There is reason to believe that the mother of two suffers from mental health issues. Upside-down: Doyle's 1992 Isuzu Rodeo SUV is seen resting on its roof at the bottom of a 300-foot hill . Rescue: Doyle and the boys, 2-year-old Nicodemus Doyle and 4-year-old Isaiah Hacket-Doyle were extracted hours after the crash by first responders . The family were airlifted to area hospitals for treatment and were later released . Close call: The woman and her two children, a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old, were found injured inside her overturned SUV resting on a beach near Fort Bragg, California, October 3 . Rambling rant: A day before the crash, Doyle wrote this paranoid Facebook status update accusing the Illumanti of trying to kill her family . A day before the crash, Doyle wrote a rambling status update on her Facebook page claiming that a shadowy organization known as the Illuminati was out to get her and her sons. 'They have been threatening to kill us. I thought by taking down what I said before it would make them happy but they just want to kill my sons and I because of something we had no control of,' Doyle wrote. Advance warning: Doyle's mother contacted the authorities in August to warn them that her daughter might be suicidal . 'They started a show about me and it wasn't enough now they are going to kill me and my family (all of them). So please watch out for my brother and work to get them the justice they deserve for killing people who did nothing to them. Thanks.' Three weeks earlier, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office issued a bulletin warning law enforcement officials that the McKinleyville woman might be suicidal. The warning went out after Doyle's mother contacted authorities saying she was concerned her daughter may harm herself or her children due to her mental problems. The following day, August 14, Ms Doyle reached out to the sheriff's office herself and arranged a meeting with officials. ‘The deputy determined she was not having any mental health issues and she and the children were in good health,’ the Sheriff’s Office said in a press release. ‘She told the deputy she was in the process of moving out [of] the area with her children and her mother was upset about that.’","Athena Renee Doyle, 35, charged with trying to kill her sons, ages 2 and 4, by intentionally driving off a 300-foot cliff in California last month .

"Men who survived the Holocaust live longer than other Jewish men of the same age who did not go through the hell of the Nazi death camps, new research has revealed. Researchers from Haifa University in Israel found a phenomenon known as 'post-traumatic growth' enabled Holocaust survivors to develop enhanced 'personal and inter-personal skills'. As a result, male survivors lived up to 18 months longer than Jewish peers who  were not confined to concentration camps during the war. Men who survived the Holocaust live longer than other Jewish men of the same age who escaped cruel treatment at camps such as Auschwitz, a new study reveals. Researchers from Haifa University found 'post-traumatic growth' enabled Holocaust survivors to develop enhanced personal and inter-personal skills . Holocaust survivors also gained 'new insights and a deeper meaning to life' as a result of their intense psychological ordeal inside the concentration camps, the scientists said. The study of more than 55,220 Polish Jews found men and women who escaped before Hitler started his campaign of terror had an average life expectancy 6.5 months shorter than those who made it to Israel between the armistice and 1950. Study leader, Professor Avi Sagi-Schwartz, from the Department of Psychology at Haifa University in Israel, said he was 'surprised' by the finding that male survivors lived for up to 18 months longer. He said: 'Holocaust survivors not only . suffered grave psychosocial trauma but also famine, malnutrition, and . lack of hygienic and medical facilities, leading us to believe these . damaged their later health and reduced life expectancy. Male Holocaust survivors lived up to 18 months longer than Jewish peers who were not confined to concentration camps during the war - a finding that 'surprised' study leader, Professor Avi Sagi-Schwartz. Here, prisoners are photographed on a death march from Dachau in 1945 . 'Surprisingly, our findings teach us of the strength and resilience of the human spirit'. A common belief among scientists is that psychological trauma shortens life expectancy by damaging the victims's DNA by shortening their 'chromosome ends' which control the lifespan of cells in the body. This inspired the research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, which is the first of its kind to use the official database of the National Insurance Institute of Israel to look at the entire Jewish population who emigrated before and after World War Two. It compared Holocaust survivors who were between four and 20-years-old when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 and found that among the women there was 'no significant difference' among the female population of Holocaust survivors. However, among the men who survived Hitler's mass extermination, life expectancy was 14 months longer than the refugees who escaped. 'Surprisingly, our findings teach us of the strength and resilience of the human spirit'. A . common belief among scientists is that psychological trauma shortens . life expectancy by damaging the victims's DNA by shortening their . 'chromosome ends' which control the lifespan of cells in the body. The appalling treatment of Holocaust victims at camps such as Birkenau (pictured) caused many scientists to think that the later health of concentration camp survivors would be damaged and their DNA shortened. But the new study shows 'the strength and resilience of the human spirit' the researchers said . The team found that the older the men in the group caught up in the Holocaust were, the longest their life expectancy. Professor Sagi-Schwartz said: 'Men who were 10 to 15-years-old during the war and in their early adolescence had a 10 month longer life-expectancy, compared to the comparison group. 'Men who lived through the Holocaust when they were 16 to 20, had an even bigger difference in life-expectancy, 18 months longer than their peers with no Holocaust experience. 'The results of this research give us hope and teach us quite a bit about the resilience of the human spirit when faced with brutal and traumatic events.'","Research by Haifa University disproves a common belief that psychological trauma shortens life expectancy by damaging the victims' DNA .

"A Young female British journalist has been subjected to a horrific sexual assault by hundreds of men while covering the Egyptian elections. Natasha Smith feared for her life as she was stripped and violently attacked by a mob of ‘animals’ who ‘tossed me around like fresh meat’ in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. She managed to escape only after putting on a burka and pretending to be the wife of a local man who smuggled her to safety. Miss Smith, 21, eventually ended up in the British Embassy and has now returned to her family home in Weymouth, Dorset. The attack happened on Sunday as crowds celebrated the announcement that Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood had won the vote to become Egypt’s first elected president. Scroll down to watch interview . Assaulted: Natasha Smith has written about her horrific ordeal in Tahrir Square on her blog . It capped a tense few weeks when there had been fears of a military coup. Miss Smith, who is studying for an MA in international journalism at . Falmouth College, Cornwall, was making a documentary on women’s rights. Her CV says she was working for a ‘multimedia publication’ Fair . Observer, which specialises in international relations. She is due to begin work next month as a researcher for Channel 4’s documentary series Unreported World. Hers is . not the first case of an attack on Western female journalists covering . the uprising in Egypt. In February 2011 CBS chief foreign correspondent . Lara Logan was set upon by 200 men in Tahrir Square while covering the . resignation of former president Hosni Mubarak. US-Egyptian . journalist Mona Eltahawy suffered a brutal sexual and physical assault . inside Cairo’s interior ministry last November, the same month a French . journalist said she had been beaten and sexually assaulted while . covering the protests. Here, in extracts from her blog, Natasha Smith  describes in terrifying detail what happened. By natasha smith . The atmosphere was one of jubilation, . excitement, and happiness as I walked, accompanied by two male . companions for safety, along Kasr El Nil bridge. Women, children and fathers smiled, waved, and cheered happily at my video camera. Fireworks lit up the sky. As . I reached the end of the bridge, I noticed the crowd became thicker, . and decided immediately to turn around to avoid Tahrir Square. My . friends and I tried to leave. I tried to put my camera back in my . rucksack. But in a split second, everything . changed. Suddenly, something shifted. I found myself being dragged from . my male friends, groped all over, with increasing force and aggression. I . screamed. I could see what was happening and I saw that I was powerless . to stop it. Rammed: Crowds in Cairo's Tahrir Square, a focus point for the Arab Spring, where the attack happened . My friend Callum did everything  he . could to hold on to me. But it was no use. Hundreds of men were dragging . me away, kicking and screaming.My camera was snatched from my grasp. My rucksack was torn from my back – it was so crowded that I didn’t even feel it. Men began to rip off my clothes. I . was stripped naked. Their insatiable appetite to hurt me heightened. These men, hundreds of them, had turned from humans to animals. Hundreds of men pulled my limbs apart . and threw me around. They were scratching and clenching my breasts and . forcing their fingers inside me in every possible way. So many men. All I could see was . leering faces, more and more faces sneering and jeering as I was tossed . around like fresh meat among starving lions. Natasha managed to escape after putting on a burka and pretending to be the wife of a local man . A small minority of men, just a . couple at first, tried to protect me and guide me to a tent. The tent . was crushed, its contents scattered all over the ground. I was tossed . around once more, being violated every second. I was dragged naked across the dirty ground. Men pulled my  blonde hair – a beacon of my alien identity. The men trying to protect me tried to . guide me into another tent. I was able to scramble on to the ground. I . sat with my back against a chair and surveyed the surging mob. Although a few men tried to form a . human shield around me, offering me rags to cover my bruised body, men . were still able to touch me. There were just too many. I gazed around at the bared teeth and . raging eyes. I was struggling to breathe. One man lifted a tent pole . and attempted to strike me with it. At this point, I said aloud to . myself, calmly, over and over: ‘Please God. Please make it stop. Please . God. Please make it stop.’ I’m not religious. But at times of . desperation, we all feel compelled to appeal to some higher power to . save us. It’s human nature. I began to think: ‘Maybe this is just . it. Maybe this is how I go, how I die. I hope it’s quick. I hope I die . before they rape me.’ I looked up and saw a couple of women in burkas scattered around. They looked at me blankly, then looked away. After five to ten minutes, my friend . managed to convince people inside a medical tent to form a pathway . through the crowd to guide me into the tent. During transit I was mauled . and invaded. I reached the tent and saw my friend . Callum. Muslim women surrounded me and frantically tried to cover my . naked body. I fell to the ground and apparently temporarily lost . consciousness. Mixed: Tahrir Square was a scene of celebration, but also of a horror, as Natasha Smith was assaulted . Brutal: Smith was attacked as thousands celebrated the victory of the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate as the new president . The women told me the attack was . motivated by rumours spread by trouble-making thugs that I was a foreign . spy, following a national advertising campaign warning of the dangers . of foreigners. But if that was the cause, it was only really used as a pretext, an excuse, to molest and violate a blonde, young Western girl. The men outside remained thirsty for . blood; their prey had been cruelly snatched from their grasp. They . peered in, so I had to duck down and hide. They attempted to attack the . tent, and those inside began making a barricade out of chairs. Women were crying and telling me: ‘This is not Egypt! This is not Islam! Please, please do not think this is what Egypt is!’ Accidental leader: Mohammed Morsi waves to the crowd during a presidential campaign rally . I reassured them that I knew that was . the case. This vicious act was not representative of the place I had . come to know and love. After much heated debate, it was . decided that Callum and I would leave separately to avoid attracting . attention. I was disguised in a burka and men’s clothes and ordered to . hold the hand of an Egyptian stranger who would pretend to be my . husband. Attacked: CBS reporter Lara Logan moments before she was assaulted in February 2011 . I was terrified but I could see it . was the only way out. He pulled me through the crowds out of the back of . the tent. He told me: ‘Don’t cry. Do not cry. Look normal.’ I was barefoot, dodging broken glass . and debris, trawling through mud and dirt. My inner reserves of strength . kicked in, and I stopped crying and just thought: ‘Keep calm and carry . on.’ The man sat me down by the side of . the road, still ordering me not to cry. Eventually, his friends turned . up, with Callum. They explained that they couldn’t take us to hospital . since they might be arrested if they were seen with us. Callum and I went on our way. We . eventually hailed a taxi. Upon reaching a government hospital down town, . we tried to explain the situation. I was eventually ushered into a small . cubicle. Two men asked: ‘Are you pregnant? Married? A virgin?’ They . seemed displeased by my response of ‘no’. I was refused examination and treatment. Eventually I decided I’d just have to check for damage myself. I went to the bathroom and couldn’t . believe the reflection. I was dirty, wounded, with hair like a tramp and . eyes wide with shock. Finally, I was taken home by my . friends, and put to bed. I didn’t want to tell my family right away, as I . knew it would destroy them. Yesterday [Monday], I had a proper . examination and darted around sorting things out, spending an eternity . giving a police report. During the examination, which was . carried out by a woman, I was crying and shaking. To have someone touch . me so soon after the event was terrifying. Broken and battered: Mona Tahawy was brutally assaulted last year . Later, I couldn’t bear to be around . groups of Egyptian men. And when it got dark, I panicked, and couldn’t . bear to look any man in the eye. I clung to Callum all day. As we drove around Cairo, I couldn’t . help but think: ‘Of all the people we’ve driven past today, one of them . must have been in that crowd of hundreds last night.’ I am determined to continue with my . documentary at some point. [It] will be fuelled by my passion to help . make people aware of just how serious this issue is, and that it’s not . just a passing news story that briefly gets people’s attention then is . forgotten. This is a consistent trend and it has to stop. Arab women, Western women – there are so many sufferers. One of the worst things two nights . ago was that I had never felt so powerless. I had no control and I was . violated. But now I can take control and rebuild my confidence.","Natasha Smith attacked by a 'group of animals' who stripped her naked .

"The founder of an internet company that allows users to convert money to an online currency has been indicted in the U.S. for a massive $6 billion money-laundering scheme - in what authorities have called the largest case of its kind in history. Arthur Budovsky, the founder of Liberty Reserve, was arrested in Spain on Friday. The Costa Rica-based company, which had more than one million users, allegedly helped hide 55 million illegal transactions across the world, authorities said today. In total, seven people indicted for their alleged part in the cyber network, which authorities said was 'staggering' in scope. Budovsky's partner, Vladimir Kats, is in custody in New York. Scroll down for video . Complex: Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, explains the global interests of Liberty Reserve during a news conference about the money-laundering arrests of its founders . Budovsky's deputy, Azzedine El Amine was also arrested, as were two technology designers, Maxim Chukarev and Mark Marmilev. Two more company employees were still at large in Costa Rica according to officials: Ahmed Yassine Abdelghani and Allan Esteban Hidalgo Jimenez. The investigation involved law enforcement in 17 countries and 'is believed to be the largest money laundering prosecution in history,' the prosecutor's office said. The suspects were indicted for allegedly facilitating millions of transactions that hid the proceeds of credit card fraud, identity theft, computer hacking, child pornography, narcotics trafficking and other crimes, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said on Tuesday. The indictment . calls the network 'one of the principal means by which cyber criminals . around the world distribute, store and launder proceeds of their illegal . activity'. 'The scope of the defendants' unlawful conduct is staggering,' it added. Press conference: Mythili Raman, left, from the Dept. of Justice, accompanied by Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, speaks about the scheme on Tuesday . Liberty Reserve was an online payment network that allowed users to convert dollars or euros into currency that could be exchanged on the internet. According to the indictment, Liberty . Reserve's currency unit was called the 'LR'. Users opened accounts at . Liberty Reserve giving only a name, address and date of birth that the . company made no attempt to verify. Customers funded their Liberty Reserve accounts with payments from a bank wire, postal money order or other money transfers. It was then converted to LR. Funds could then be transferred to or bought by another account holder via third-party exchange merchants. Each transaction cost $2.99. Liberty Reserve allowed users to open accounts using fictitious names, including 'Russian Hacker' and 'Hacker Account.' The indictment said Liberty Reserve . did not collect any banking or transaction information from the . third-party exchange companies. It also let its users hide their Liberty . Exchange account numbers when making transactions, which offered . another opportunity for the users to mask their true identities. The company processed around 12 . million financial transactions per year. Since it began operating in . 2006, the indictment said, Liberty Reserve laundered over $6 billion in . criminal proceeds. Digital currency is made up of transferable units that can be exchanged for cash. Over the past decade, its use has expanded, attracting attention from the media and Wall Street. The most widely known digital currency is called Bitcoin. Liberty Reserve's currency was not connected to Bitcoin. In announcing the case on Tuesday . afternoon, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the network 'became the bank . of choice for the criminal underworld'. Its digital currency service was designed to shield the identity of crooked users seeking to launder ill-gotten gains, he said. 'The coin of the realm was anonymity,' he said. 'It was the opposite of a know-your-customer policy.' In a statement, Costa Rica police . confirmed that Budovsky had been arrested in Spain on money laundering . charges and that several premises linked to his company had been raided. A . notice pasted across Liberty Reserve's website last week said the . domain 'has been seized by the United States Global Illicit Financial . Team'. Liberty Reserve's demise is likely to send a sharp shock across the Internet. It allowed users to open accounts using fictitious names, including 'Russian Hacker' and 'Hacker Account.' The network charged a 1 per cent fee on transactions. Budovsky and Katz have previous convictions on charges related to an unlicensed money-transmitting business, according to court papers. After that case, the pair decided to move their operation to Costa Rica, where Budovsky officially renounced his U.S. citizenship, the papers say. In an online chat captured by law enforcement, Katz admitted Liberty Reserve was 'illegal' and noted that authorities in the United States knew it was 'a money laundering operation that hackers use'. Aditya Sood, a computer science . doctoral candidate at Michigan State University who has studied the . underground economy, described Liberty Reserve as a no-questions-asked . alternative to the global banking system, with little more than a valid . email needed to open an account and start moving money across borders. Explanation: Bharara speaks beside a chart detailing the operation of the Costa Rica-based company . 'You don't need to provide your full . details, or personal information, or things like that,' Sood said. 'There's no way to trace an account. That's the beauty of the system.' Liberty Reserve's ease of use also . attracted a thriving community of tech-savvy users in countries with . limited access to credit cards, said Mitchell Rossetti, whose . Houston-based ePayCards.com was one of several mainstream merchants that . accepted the online-only currency. Rossetti said his business still had about $28,000 tied up in Liberty Reserve accounts. Liberty Reserve's irreversible transactions made it attractive to small merchants worried about fraud. 'The irony of this is I went to them because of the security,' Rossetti said. 'All sales were final.' Trouble ahead? The online currency network is similar to Bitcoin, which has garnered a large community . He acknowledged that the currency was . being used by scammers, but said Liberty Reserve was just like any other . currency. 'The U.S. dollar can be donated to a church or it can pay a . prostitute,' he said. Liberty Reserve appears to have played an important role in laundering the proceeds from the recent theft of some $45 million from two Middle Eastern banks, according to legal documents made public by U.S. authorities earlier this month.

"A mother of four has been found dead in a burnt-out car just 18 months after her partner was shot dead. Donna Eastwood, 26, whose children are aged between five and eight months, was murdered after a petty row broke out at a party near her home on Friday night. She is thought to have been stabbed before her killer tried to cover up the murder by dumping her body in a car which was set ablaze on a remote country lane in Wilmington, Kent. Donna Eastwood (left) was murdered after a petty fight broke out at a party near her home on Friday night. Last year her partner Kevin McKinley (right) was shot dead . Last night detectives were questioning a 26-year-old man on suspicion of murder after her body was discovered in the rural enclave at 6.20am on Saturday. After a frantic search by police helicopters and teams scouring local woodland and fields, a man was arrested at 2.30pm yesterday. The development came hours after speculation on social media about the identity of the killer, said to be known to the victim. It is understood an argument broke out at the party after a remark by Miss Eastwood caused another reveller to fly into a rage. Miss Eastwood, of Dartford, had only recently lost her partner and father of three of her children, Kevin McKinley, who was shot dead last year. The 32-year-old was blasted with a 12-bore shotgun as his son sat yards away in a parked car last February. Michaela Sargeant, 25, was jailed for eight years for manslaughter after shooting Mr McKinley in a dispute outside her Dartford home. The woman's body was found in a car which had been set ablaze down a country lane in Wilmington, Kent . Police cordoned off the road where her body was found amid a frantic hunt for the culprit on Saturday . Her partner, 26-year-old Lewis Wickenden, was jailed for five years for assisting an offender. At the time of his death, a distraught Miss Eastwood wrote on a tribute site: ‘One love for u never stop lovin u never xxxxxxxxxxxx.’ Last night police said they did not believe his death was linked to Miss Eastwood’s murder. Yesterday a member of Miss Eastwood’s family said: ‘She’s got four young kids and they lost their dad last year. One of them is only eight months and another is only 18 months, they don’t even know what’s going on yet. ‘We don’t want any more trouble. We’re a big family and we’re just trying to take it in and make sure the babies are looked after.’ Last night neighbours claimed that the young mother had a troubled upbringing. One said: ‘She was a nice girl, always said hello to you but her life was diabolical. ‘I don’t know how her mother has the strength to cope with it to be honest, because a lot of the time she was looking after the four children as well.’ Police scoured the area with helicopters and riot vans after the mother's body was found in a burnt out car . Michaela Sargeant was charged with manslaughter following Mr McKinley's death last year. She is serving an eight-year sentence in jail . Last night friends left floral tributes at the leafy country lane where her body was found in a spot popular with dog walkers, runners and horse riders. A police spokesman said: ‘Kent Police is treating the death of a woman, who police believe to be from the local area, as an isolated, targeted attack in which the offender and the victim knew each other. ‘There is no information to suggest members of the public are in danger.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Donna Eastwood was murdered following a party near her Kent home .

"A Chinese model enthusiast has built a real-life Batmobile - for just £7,000. Businessman Li Weilei, 26, painstakingly put together the two-ton model with four mechanics in a quiet residential workshop in Shanghai. The remarkable replica is almost identical to Bruce Wayne's wheels in the Dark Knight trilogy, with just one crucial difference - it doesn't have an engine. Scrapheap challenge: One of the mechanics puts the finishing touches to 26-year-old Li Weilei's remarkable Batmobile replica. The model cost just £7,000 to make, though there is one hitch - it doesn't have an engine . Spot the difference: The real-life Batmobile used in the Dark Knight films - which cost considerably more . Instead the enthusiasts have had to move their creation about using a professional scrapyard hoist. The five friends put together the model at a workshop in the Minhang district, where photos of the creation alongside cyclists and passers-by quickly went viral online. They saved money at every turn, spending just 70,000 yuan (£7,100) and hand-polishing the bodywork to save cash. With extensive experience in prop . design and talent in cutting and soldering, they made the whole model from 10 tons of scrap metal in two months. They have now made a series of the cars, Li said. 'We've built a . dozen Batman's cars,' he added. 'Two of them are in Shanghai, while the rest are on . display in other parts of the country.' Batman returns? The model turned heads among residents in the rural Minhang district of Shanghai . The creators saved money at every turn, spending just 70,000 yuan (£7,100) and hand-polishing the car .

Huge: The low-slung car is more than 10ft wide with rear wheels almost half as tall as a grown person . Feng Dohan, a police officer who . took photos of the car, said: 'We have had a lot of enquiries, but I hate to . disappoint fans.The vehicle is actually a life-size model of Batman's . futuristic car. 'It is quite amazing though - not the sort of vehicle . you want to give a ticket to.' The low-slung car is more . than 10ft wide with rear wheels almost half as tall as a . grown person. Their model is almost a hundred times cheaper than a fully-functioning 'Tumbler' Batmobile which went on sale earlier this year. Just one of five replicas built, it featured a 5.7-litre V8 engine and 44-inch tyres and is completely street legal. That's more than can be said for Li's model - and there's one other hitch, too. For copyright reasons his car is not a Batmobile, nor has it ever been called one. Labour of love: The enthusiasts spend two months putting together the model with 10 tones of scrap metal . Helpless: Because the car has no engine, they had to lift it off the ground using a scrapyard hoist . Just working on my car: A mechanic makes the finishing touches to spare parts on the £7,000 Batmobile . Model: Li said he had made a number of the replicas and they had gone on show in Shanghai .

"A father has been . charged with murder on Friday after allegedly shooting a drunk driver moments after he plowed into his truck killing his two young sons. David Barajas, 31, and his . sons, 12-year-old David Jr. and 11-year-old Caleb, were about 50 yards . from their Houston-area home when a car crashed into them on a dark rural road. David Jr. died at the scene, while Caleb died later at a hospital. Broken family: David Barajas, 31, turned himself in after police charged him with the murder of the man who killed his sons, David Jr., 12, and Caleb, 11, in a drunk driving accident . Triple tragedy: Jose Banda, left, was killed with a gunshot wound to the . head just moments after the fatal collision that took the lives of the . Barajas brothers, pictured on the right . Neighbors . said they heard gunshots minutes after the Dec. 7 crash near Alvin, . about 30 miles southeast of Houston. Jose Banda, the 20-year-old driver . who hit the boys, was later found shot in the head. His death was ruled a . homicide. Investigators believe Banda had been drinking before the crash, and they're awaiting the results of blood tests on him. At a funeral service for the two boys, family and friends spoke of the . brothers' love of sports and their family. Their . uncle, Gabriel Barajas, said David and Caleb were ‘inseparable’ and . ‘playful.’ Caleb's nickname was the ‘Big C’ and Gabriel Barajas said . both boys were big fans of the Houston Texans. Many of those at the . service wore Texans jerseys in honor of the boys. The . tragedy unfolded just after 11pm when the Barajas’ family car ran out of gas along County Road 144 about 30 miles from . Houston, MyFox Houston reported.. Caleb and David . were helping push their father’s stalled truck when a car driven by . 21-year-old Jose Banda slammed into the vehicle from behind. Kind words: The two brothers were remembered by family and friends as diehard Texans fans who were inseparable and playful . The older of the two brother was . killed on the spot, while his 11-year-old brother was airlifted to a . hospital, where he eventually succumbed to his injuries. The Harris County Medical Examiner said just moments after the fatal crash, Banda died from a gunshot wound to the head. Police said no weapon has been recovered at the scene, but shots were heard after the crash. Janie . Tellez, Banda’s aunt, came to her nephew’s defense, demanding that his . killer be arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. ‘It was an accident. He didn't . purposely do that,’ Tellez told ABC13. 'Whoever did it is getting away with murdering my nephew. He deserves . justice.’ Brazoria County sheriff's . investigator Dominick Sanders said Monday that witnesses told . authorities they saw Barajas, right after the crash, walk to his home . and then return a few minutes later and approach Banda's vehicle. Evidence showed one shot was fired, he said. Perished: Caleb Barajas, 11, left, and his 12-year-old brother, David, right, were killed last Friday when a drunken driver plowed into their family truck . 'Every . time we would pursue a lead, it always came back to Mr. Barajas,' Sanders said. 'We have numerous statements placing him there at the car . in close proximity to the victim at the time the gunshot was fired.' Members of the Barajas family have been accused since the accident. After the accident and shooting, the Barajas told KHOU 11 News Wednesday that someone has threatened a drive-by shooting at the family’s home, forcing the grieving family to go into hiding. According to the slain boys’ parents, someone wrote a message on Facebook accusing Cindy Barajas of shooting Banda. ‘I . don’t know why people would think something like that or why people . would try to accuse them of something when they already have two babies . lost,’ said Sally Roman, who was friends with the two young victims. Barajas . was indicted for murder Friday and turned himself in Sunday. He was . being held Monday in the Brazoria County Jail on a $450,000 bond. Court . records did not list an attorney for him. Horrific wreck: The Barajas' truck was out of gas and the two boys were helping their father push their vehicle towards their house just 50 yards away when Banda plowed into them . Gabriel . Barajas, David Barajas' brother, had previously said his sibling had . remembered the crash as a 'blur' and called speculation that his brother . or another family member might have been responsible for Banda's murder 'ugly.' Barajas' wife, Cindy, was in the truck when it was hit, along with the couple's 8-year-old daughter and 3-month-old son. A . search of Barajas' home found ammunition that is consistent with the . bullet that killed Banda, but authorities have not located the weapon . used in the shooting, Sanders said. The case is 'going to be much more . difficult if we don't have a weapon,' he added. Gunshot residue tests were done on both Barajas and Banda, and authorities are still waiting for those results, Sanders said. Investigators . also are awaiting DNA test results of some 'biological material' that . was found at the scene. Sanders declined to elaborate on the material . that is being tested.","Father David Barajas, 31, was charged with murder in the shooting death of Jose Banda, 20 .

"FA Cup heroes Bradford City have the chance of a third Wembley visit in two years after landing a quarter-final home draw to Championship Reading. The Bantams – 2-0 winners over Sunderland on Sunday - had hoped to be paired with Manchester United at Valley Parade but will now be favourites to make it through to the last four for the first time since winning the competition in 1911.

But Bradford will be looking to steal the headlines once again. Phil Parkinson’s side were League Cup runners-up in 2013 before triumphing in the League Two play-off final. Playmaker Billy Knott only joined the club in the summer and, after last night’s favourable draw, now wants a piece of the Wembley action. ‘I honestly think we can beat anyone at Valley Parade,’ he said. ‘With a home tie the fans will come out in force and it showed against Sunderland they really are the 12th man. ‘It’s hard for us not to perform in front of them, it makes such a difference. We’ll respect Reading, like we do every team, but we’ve got great belief in ourselves right now. ‘It is every boy's dream to play at Wembley and the next game is like a final for us.’ Meanwhile, the BBC is in discussions with the FA about delaying their decision on which matches to choose for live coverage. Arsenal and Arsene Wenger (r) won the FA Cup last season after beating Hull City 3-2 in the final at Wembley . The broadcaster received criticism for not showing Bradford’s victory but defended that choice by revealing they had to make their selection before the outcome of the fourth-round replay between Sunderland and Fulham. BBC football editor Mark Cole said: ‘We are speaking to the FA about whether we can change this in the future, but understand it’s tricky for them. ‘Clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing, policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for TV companies to confirm their selections. ‘But we hope there’s a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like Sunday.’ Aston Villa will host West Bromwich Albion in a Midlands derby at Villa Park .

"West Ham co-owner David Sullivan was confronted by angry fans outside The Hawthorns after the Hammers' 4-0 FA Cup defeat to West Bromwich Albion. Shocking footage shows Sullivan responding to abuse from a group of supporters after he left the ground before full-time after what he describes as West Ham's 'worst performance of the season'. The fans are heard abusing and swearing at the club's co-owner and urging him to sack  manager Sam Allardyce. West Ham co-owner David Sullivan was abused as he left The Hawthorns around 25 minutes early . Sullivan fields questions from angry supporters after the 4-0 loss at West Brom . Sullivan looked horrified with West Ham's performance in the 4-0 thrashing at The Hawthorns . Despite an impressive campaign that currently places them eighth in the Barclays Premier League, West Ham fans chanted against Allardyce at The Hawthorns on Saturday as a Brown Ideye brace and goals from James Morrison and Saido Berahino condemned them to an FA Cup fifth-round exit. As he attempted to leave a car park close to the ground, Sullivan was approached by a group of fans and responds to their opinions in the video footage by asking: 'who else is going to take over?' One supporter repeatedly asks Sullivan: 'Why are you leaving early?' before adding: 'I've got to travel back on the f***ing train, not a f***ing Rolls Royce or a f***ing plane.' Sam Allardyce has had a good season at West Ham but their supporters are not happy with him . Plenty of West Ham supporters left the ground early, leaving a heavily depleted away end with 10 minutes left . West Brom record signing Brown Ideye scored twice to condemn West Ham to an FA Cup exit . Sullivan says: 'I've never left early all season. That was was the worst performance all season.' One supporter asks for 'answers' from the co-owner, while another shouts abuse about Allardyce. The 66-year-old again attempts to leave after shaking the hand of two fans before another shouts abuse about Hammers vice-chairman Karren Brady. The confrontation ends with some fans praising Sullivan by shouting 'fair play David' while another shouts 'you're a c***'. The east Londoners have also received dozens of emails from fans, reacting furiously to a minority who reacted so angrily to the Cup defeat. Fans have apologised for the behaviour and back Sullivan to continue taking the club forward. Allardyce was the subject of chants from the away end as his side went down to a heavy defeat . West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady was also referred to by one supporter in the argument . A source close Sullivan told Sportsmail: ‘He never leaves and considers it his duty to stay, but he was crestfallen by the performance and had seen enough. At 4-0 down and down to ten men, he couldn’t face all the glad-handing in the boardroom after the game. ‘He was happy to talk to the supporters, as he always is, and he understand emotions were running high, but they became aggressive and abusive. ‘David remains as committed to West Ham as ever and wants the club to continue to make progress. He was bitterly disappointed with what he called ""the worst performance of the season"", but the club are eighth in the Premier League and he is demanding a big finish to what has been a good season.’ On Monday evening, Sullivan's son Jack took to Twitter to defend his father and said: 'Just seen the video of my dad getting abused. 'Firstly, I would like to say that I think it is terrible how disrespectful some of the fans are towards owners who arguably saved WHU and don't think that my dad deserves this treatment at all. 'Secondly, as none of you will know my Dad's Mum is very ill in hospital and he was going to visit her, I think many people do not think We have anything going on in our lives, it's not just West Ham.'

That was the worst performance all season. Fan voice 2: Can you give us something back though? Fan voice 2: Can we just forget it and instead of palming it all off can we have some answers? Sullivan: I'll shake your hand, shake your hand, shake your hand. Fan voice 5: I've been a West Ham supporter for 40 f***ing years. Why aren't you f***ing doing something? Fan voice 2: Can we have some answers? Fan voice 2: Can we have some answers please? Sullivan: That's not big and it's not clever. Fan voice 6: That's not funny.

"Netflix has agreed to stop 'shaming' Verizon on its website when streaming speeds begin to slow, but are adamant that load times depend on the internet provider and not their service. The announcement comes after Verizon sent the film and TV subscription service a cease-and-desist letter on Thursday, concerning a loading screen message that said its network was 'crowded' when videos failed to load immediately. Verizon's lawyers said the notice could be detrimental to business and claimed Netflix could not prove that its network was congested. But while Netlifx confirmed Monday that the notices will stop appearing from June 16,  spokesman Joris Evers played down that the decision was solely concerned with Verizon's complaint. Loading screen: The message displayed by Netflix blames Verizon for slow load times . 'We do tests of different lengths (of internet speed),' Evers told The Washington Post. 'That doesn't mean there won't be another one, and it doesn't mean there won't be multiple ones that run in concert after this.' Netflix said they were trying to help customers understand the performance of the broadband network they were subscribed to. In its monthly index for May, which ranks the streaming speeds of various carriers and was published by Quartz, Netflix noted that Verizon had taken a strong dip in speed since April. It was in mid-May that the 'crowded' messages first started appearing. 'We pay some of the world’s largest transit networks to deliver Netflix video right to the front door of an ISP,' a Netflix spokesman told The Verge. 'Where the problem occurs is at that door — the interconnection point — when the broadband provider hasn’t provided enough capacity to accommodate the traffic their customer requested.' Telling: Netflix has released its monthly index, which ranks the streaming speed of various internet providers. Netflix said Verizon has gotten much slower since April, with Verizon saying they are busy upgrading their network so it will be faster . 'This is . about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband . provider,' added Netflix spokesman Jonathan Friedland. 'We . are trying to provide more transparency, just like we do with the ISP . Speed Index, and Verizon is trying to shut down that discussion.' The deadline on Verizon's cease-and-desist letter was set for tomorrow, June 10. In a recent interview with CNET, Verizon's head of regulatory affairs, David Young, said the blame game was a 'moot point' because the company is busy rolling out improvements to its network that will boost the speeds. He said any lag was the result ofa recent commercial agreement between Verizon and Netflix, which would give Verizon users better access to the streaming site. 'We can't just snap our fingers and the network is upgraded,' said Young. 'We need new facilities. 'We have to do the equipment engineering. 'Build it and test it. 'We are doing all of that right now. 'And it should be completed during this year.'","Netflix has been showing a screen message saying the Verizon network is 'crowded' when films and shows take time loading .

"Eden Hazard might be spearheading Chelsea's quest for three trophies this season, but manager Jose Mourinho is still demanding more from his star player. Chelsea face Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night with Hazard fresh from signing a new five-and-a-half-year deal at Stamford Bridge - and Mourinho now expects the playmaker to step up his goalscoring exploits to match the best players in the world. The Special One's benchmarks for the Belgian are Cristiano Ronaldo (with 38 goals in 35 appearances this season) and Lionel Messi (37 in 36) - although Hazard's ratio of 13 goals in 39 games show he has some way to go yet. Eden Hazard trains ahead of facing PSG - and Jose Mourinho wants him to start scoring more for Chelsea . Hazard has scored 13 goals in 39 appearances this season - some way off the world's best players . 'Jose Mourinho would like for me to score more,' Hazard told French TV station Telefoot. 'Us forwards need to score and to pass. But I think I compensate for that given how many chances I create. 'I'm fouled a lot, there are a lot of free-kicks and penalties that I win. But he'd like me to score more, like those great players (Messi and Ronaldo) who score two or three times each game.' Hazard is in his third season at Stamford Bridge following a £32million move from Lille in the summer of 2012 and he admits that for a player of his talent he should be scoring more. The Belgian playmaker feels the number of free-kicks and penalties he wins compensates for his lack of goals . Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are still some way clear of Hazard in the goalscoring stakes . 'Apart from my last season in France I was always reproached for not being clinical enough, a good player but not clinical. Progressively I’ve taken that on board and I’ve often managed to be clinical in the big games. 'I’m continuing to improve. I’m only 24 and I’ve done some pretty good things in football already. So I hope it continues like this, that we’ll win trophies this year and again next year. We’ll be able to get better every season.'

The rail, bare on Sunday evening, has been replenished with the final six in stock – four small sizes and two extra-large. It is unclear whether Sherwood’s arrival had a similar uplift to gilet sales as it did the team’s performance after half-time against Leicester City. To coincide with Tim Sherwood's sppointment Aston Villa gilets have gone on sale in the club store . The price on the sleeveless jackets has been reduced from £42 to £29 . Former Tottenham manager Sherwood was unveiled as Aston Villa manager on Monday . Whatever, should he request the garment he made somewhat famous over five months in charge at Tottenham Hotspur, he may have to wait a little. He walked into the press conference room in the Trinity Road Stand wearing a suit, v-neck jumper, and the confidence needed in such a precarious situation. A mention was immediately made of that missing bit of warm clothing. Sherwood puffed his cheeks. ‘F****** hell, I thought it would be two seconds before I heard a gilet joke,’ he said. ‘It was one!’ More is needed than a well-timed comic quip in Villa’s current plight of course, but Sherwood’s words brought a breath of fresh air to a place that has developed a stale odour. He was alert and direct, never far from allowing a drop of humour to enter proceedings. ‘Honest’, was a word uttered more than once. The 47-year-old was already batting off comments about his gilet at the first press conference . Sherwood gave his new players a half-time team talk during FA Cup fifth-round win over Leicester on Sunday . That is what his new players can expect. Straight-talking criticism aimed at provoking an immediate upturn in performances and also education for lasting improvement. Noble aims to speak of, harder to implement in practice. Listening to Sherwood for nearly an hour, though, it is clear Villa have acted correctly in jettisoning Paul Lambert and bringing in the former Spurs head coach. Whether he does indeed keep Villa safe from relegation remains to be seen. A change was undoubtedly required. Sherwood was clear that he needs to provide a short, sharp shock straight away to keep Villa up. Beyond that point, he wants to work with young talents – as long as the club academy has them – and bring more through to the first-team. Sherwood was in good form as he faced the media for the first time on Monday . Sherwood arrived bright and early at Villa Park on Monday morning for his unveiling . Of the here and now, Sherwood said: ‘I’ve got a way I like to work, it has been a success albeit a short period. I know how to win games in this league. I know how to galvanise players, get the best out of them, that is what I will do here.’ Sherwood remains the Spurs manager with the best Premier League win ratio (59 per cent) but still some question his appointment on terms of experience. He had a decent answer here too. ‘There are a lot of poor experienced managers,’ he said plainly. ‘A lot of good ones too. I think it’s overrated to be honest.’ There was that word again. Sherwood adopted the claret and blue scarf for his promotional shots in the stands at Villa Park, beneath a cloudy sky that seemed apt for the club’s predicament. At the same time a scattering of customers perused the shop across the road, searching for value. If Sherwood manages to keep Villa in the Premier League, he will be viewed as the best bargain of the year.","Tim Sherwood was unveiled as the new Aston Villa manger on Monday .

"Wilfried Bony has finally arrived at Manchester City after a visa issue stalled his eagerly anticipated start to life at the Etihad. The striker's £28million move from Swansea was confirmed a month ago but Bony was not able to train with his new club until Monday as the former Swansea striker had to renew his visa before returning from the Africa Cup of Nations. The Ivorian is settling into life with his new club and is available for selection ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash against Newcastle.

The Ivory Coast international (centre) will be hoping to make his City debut against Newcastle on Saturday . Bony (right) moved from Swansea in a £28million deal during last month's transfer window . Bony, along with new City team-mate Yaya Toure, was part of the Ivory Coast side that claimed their their first Africa Cup of Nations since 1992 in dramatic fashion after beating Ghana 9-8 on penalties in the final. There has certainly a buzz around the Etihad since Bony's arrival was confirmed with City forward Jesus Navas stating last week that the the former Swans frontman reminds him of former Manchester City team-mate and friend Alvaro Negredo. Navas is hoping the 26-year-old's arrival will help bring a new dimension to Manuel Pellegrini's side as they look to bridge the gap on league leaders Chelsea.

'He is powerful, has good technique and excellent movement so I'm really looking forward to playing alongside him. 'He is a great addition to the strikers we already have and I think he will do really well at City.

"Eden Hazard might have just committed his long-term future to Chelsea - but that isn't stopping their Champions League opponents Paris Saint-Germain from sniffing around the Belgian playmaker . Chelsea travel to Paris to face PSG in their Champions League round of 16 first leg on Tuesday, and the hosts' captain Thiago Silva has spoken out about his admiration for the 24-year-old Blues star. Hazard put pen to paper on a new five-and-half-year, £200,000-a-week contract at Stamford Bridge on Thursday and Silva made it clear his side would be wary of the man who scored Chelsea's only goal in their 3-1 defeat at the Parc des Princes last season. Eden Hazard has been a regular target for Paris Saint-Germain but has signed a new deal with Chelsea . PSG captain Thiago Silva said he would welcome Hazard to the Parc des Princes if he were to move . Silva (right) watches on as Hazard converts his penalty against PSG in last season's Champions League . 'He is not just good, he is very good!' Silva said. 'If he really comes, he will be very welcome.' 'All their players are very accomplished, but I believe the Brazilians always make the difference, plus Hazard.' Silva, who also picked Hazard as one of his players of the tournament so far, claimed there would be a change in attitude from the French champions compared to last season's meeting between these two sides. Silva labelled Hazard as: 'not just good, very good' and believes he and Chelsea's Brazilians to be a threat . Silva has skippered PSG through a difficult campaign, although they beat Barcelona in the group stages . Following a 3-1 win in Paris that saw the PSG bench goading Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, Silva and co crashed out of Europe's premier competition at Stamford Bridge with Demba Ba's late goal securing a 2-0 win allowing Chelsea to advance on the away goals rule. 'In the last match (against Chelsea) we thought our team was already qualified,' the Brazilian told Champions League sponsors Nissan. 'We learn a lot from all defeats. One important thing to always remember is that until the referee stops, the match is not done yet.' John Terry, Petr Cech and Ramires compete with Silva during last year's Champions League clash .

"Jose Mourinho has left Thibaut Courtois sweating on his place in the Chelsea team ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League clash against Paris St-Germain. Courtois was left out of the team to face Everton last week in the Barclays Premier League because Mourinho claimed he had physical and mental fatigue. Cech was exceptional in the 1-0 victory over Everton at Stamford Bridge and is desperate to re-establish himself as the first choice keeper again. Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech train on Monday ahead of the PSG match, but neither know who will start . Jose Mourinho refused to admit which of his goalkeepers will get the nod to start on Tuesday night . Mourinho said: ‘Petr and Courtois don’t know who is playing at this moment, so I cannot tell you. ‘I repeat, Chelsea have the two best keepers in the Premier League. I am very happy with both. The team is very confident because they know that behind them they have a good keeper.’ Mourinho also confirmed that Diego Costa, who missed three domestic games in England because of his stamp on Emre Can in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, starts up front.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of FA Cup fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League... 1. Theo Walcott’s hopes of being used as a central striker are being damaged by the sensational scoring form of Olivier Giroud. When Walcott signed his new £100,000 a week contract a year ago it was on the promise of playing in his favourite role – he’d just made his case by getting five goals in as many games after being moved from the wings. Theo Walcott sees his best chance brilliantly saved by Middlesbrough keeper Tomas Mejias . Walcott had come off the bench to replace Danny Welbeck, but has not completed 90 minutes this season . Fast forward and Walcott has yet to play 90 minutes since recovering from injury, while Giroud has seven goals from his last nine games and Danny Welbeck is also competing for the same position. It didn’t help Walcott’s case that his one big opportunity to get on the score sheet against Middlesbrough saw him denied by a brilliant Tomas Mejias save. The England star wants to play as a central striker, but will need to start scoring more goals . 2. Sam Allardyce blamed West Ham’s miserable showing at West Brom on fatigue after his squad had played three games in six days. Nine of the Hammers starting line-up for the 4-0 drubbing at The Hawthorns had been involved in all of the fixtures, including making a trip to Southampton that according to Google Maps is 120 miles away. You’d have some sympathy with him – except ten of the side that Tony Pulis picked had also been involved in three games in six days. Mind you their away game, at Burnley, was only 119 miles away. Under-fire Sam Allardyce blamed heavy legs for West Ham's cup exit, but West Brom had played just as much . 3. Tom Cleverley has had his critics at both Manchester United and Aston Villa for passing square or backwards – but working for Tim Sherwood might just help him rediscover the spark that got him into the England squad back when Sir Alex Ferguson was his gaffer. Tom Cleverley has played just 29 per cent of passes forward this season, but should improve under Sherwood . In 22 appearances for Villa this season the 25-year-old had hit barely 29 per cent of 880 passes forwards. But after new boss Sherwood went into the dressing room at half time against Leicester to give his first talk, Cleverley was transformed. In all he hit 28 out of 42 passes forward in the 2-1 FA Cup win – a total of 66 per cent. 4. Maybe it was the poor pitch, maybe it was the way Phil Parkinson’s Bradford snapped into tackles, but Sunderland’s performance at Valley Parade was abysmal. Most Premier League players achieve passing accuracy figures of at least 80 per cent in most games, with many registering scores in the 90s. Liam Bridcutt's 19.3 per cent pass completion was the best Sunderland can manage in a shocking showing . But not one of Gus Poyet’s team that became the League One side’s latest victims found a team mate with more than Liam Bridcutt’s meagre 59.3 per cent of passes. Midfielders Adam Johnson and Sebastian Larsson both gave it away 16 times out of the 32 attempts to pass the ball. 5. Simon Mignolet has recovered from the mini confidence crisis that saw him taken out of the firing line by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. Simon Mignolet, who has conceded just four goals in nine games, comes to punch against Crystal Palace . Fraizer Campbell’s early goal for Crystal Palace was only the fourth the 26-year-old Belgian has conceded in his last nine games – and the faith that Rodgers now has in him is shown by the fact he’s getting picked for Cup ties as well as Premier League games. Mignolet made three good saves to protect Liverpool’s 2-1 win, and also made half a dozen catches. 6. Things are not going so well, though, for Jack Butland who faces the rest of the season sat on the bench behind Asmir Begovic at Stoke. The 21-year-old who was a surprise late call-up for Roy Hodgson’s Euro 2012 squad had been told by boss Mark Hughes he would play in Cup games and should use them to challenge for the number one Premier League spot. Jack Butland conceded four times against Blackburn, and may now have limited opportunities this season . But the 4-1 defeat to Championship Blackburn leaves Butland, who spent the first part of the season out on loan at Derby to get game time, facing the fact he’ll get few more opportunities this season. 7. Jordan Ibe’s return to Liverpool after half a season polishing up his act under Steve McClaren’s guidance at Derby has given an opportunity to another bright young star to step up. McClaren has filled the place in his promotion chasing squad by taking Manchester United’s equally precocious Jesse Lingard on loan. The 22-year-old, just recovered from the knee injury he suffered making his United debut against Swansea in August, was the pick of Derby’s players in their 2-1 defeat by Reading. 8. Fulham owner Shahid Khan might be considering reforming his “managerial search committee” as his club’s miserable season takes another turn for the worse. Khan tasked a five-man committee that included former players Brian McBride, Danny Murphy and Niall Quinn to head hunt a replacement for Felix Magath when the German was sacked in September. Kit Symons made a great start with Fulham, but their form has begun to slip in recent weeks . In the event they never needed to deliver their report as Kit Symons won five games out of seven to land the job. Since then the 43-year-old former Academy chief has not found life so simple – the 2-1 home defeat by Ipswich made it just two wins from his last 13 games. 9. Nearly 15 years since the infamous Old Trafford match when he was chased by Roy Keane and a possee of Manchester United players, referee Andy D’ Urso is still causing controversy. The 51-year-old steadfastly refused to hang up his whistle despite getting relegated from the elite list in 2005. Walsall boss Dean Smith slammed him for failing to give a penalty and a red card when Jordy Hiwula appeared to be pulled back by Ryan Inniss as the Saddlers lost 1-0 at home to Port Vale. 10. Charlton teenager Tareiq Holmes-Dennis has made a dramatic difference to Plymouth since joining John Sheridan’s League Two team on loan. The West Country club had gone seven games without a win before the 19-year-old was recalled from a loan spell with Oxford and then sent to sign at Home Park. The 2-0 win over Cambridge made it three wins in a row without conceding a goal, and pushed Sheridan’s team back into the League Two play-off places.","At Arsenal Giroud's form is keeping Walcott out of his preferred position .

"In Valley Parade’s cramped and drafty media room with zero space for manoeuvre amid the television cameras, laptops, reporters and tea ladies, Gus Poyet still managed to unearth a new excuse for Sunderland’s shortcomings. We’ve had his players, the fans, the club hierarchy and referees – now it’s the turn of the Press. 'The problem is you, not me,’ he said, nodding towards a small gathering of North-East journalists, myself included. Gus Poyet cuts a frustrated figure on the touchline during Sunderland's defeat to Bradford in the FA Cup . Poyet later blamed the club's problems on the Press as Sunderland lurch from one defeat to the next . 'If we close Sunderland - if we put a China Wall around the city - it would be fantastic. 'Now, when we let you in and you get out and say what you want, we've got a problem. I invite every Sunderland fan and people around the club not to listen to any one of you - only to me.' Poyet, then, wants to create a closed state where supporters are only exposed to his words and no outside interpretation of them. Too often, however, he talks in riddles - it needs a third party to decode his message. But following the 2-0 humiliation at Bradford his target was clear, and it wasn't the players who had just under-performed so badly against League One opposition. Poyet’s mood lurches between happy, sad, relief and frustration – often all within the confines of one interview. He is, at his best, and normally during a pre-match media gathering, engaging, funny, honest and vibrant. Earlier this month he sat for 20 minutes and told us all about his famous father, Washington, who captained the national basketball team at the Olympics. He enjoyed it, and so did we. Jon Stead finds the back of the net as Bradford cause another shock to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals . Bradford celebrate their FA Cup victory and their place in the last eight of the famous old competition . John O'Shea (left) trudges off dejected after scoring an own goal in the third minute . Fast forward to the aftermath of last week’s defeat to QPR and he’s at the other end of the court, on the defensive and accusing his players of pandering to the want of supporters – ‘crazy football’ he called it. Just a fortnight earlier, following the most arduous goalless draw with Fulham, Poyet said the club’s fans were ‘living in the past’ and pining for Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips. It didn’t go down well. Previously he has spoken of his players not being able to implement the style of play he wants, while sporting director Lee Congerton, pre January, was the subject of pressure to deliver the personnel he needed to avoid a repeat of last season’s relegation fight. ‘I am only the head coach, I only pick the team,’ a favourite soundbite of Poyet’s. But always, given a few days to reflect, he attempts to play down the subsequent headlines and offers reason for his post-game outbursts. So why now does he turn on the Press? He was asked that as he squeezed out of the media room on Sunday, the ‘China Wall’ analogy his final utterance. He refused to answer. Poyet previously claimed Sunderland fans were pining for the days of strikers Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips . Reporters who do not work the North-East patch were stunned by his attack. This, however, has been bubbling under the surface for a while and it was inevitable the Press would eventually incur his wrath given that all other factions had previously been targeted. He is in danger of alienating himself and club bosses will be concerned at the situation which is unfolding. During the second half at Bradford, supporters sang ‘Gustavo Poyet, it’s always our fault’ before a scuffle broke out in the away end – it demonstrated more fighting spirit than the players had shown on the pitch and they were duly booed at the end of the game. It has left a huge disconnect between all parties – Poyet, players, supporters and Press. Results, of course, can change everything. But Sunderland have won just four times in the Premier League this season and currently reside just two points above the relegation zone. It has been a sorry season, low on energy and entertainment. The significance of Saturday’s visit of West Brom cannot be underplayed, both in terms of points on the board and mood on the terraces. Before then, it promises to be interesting when Poyet meets with the Press on Thursday. Once we have scaled the wall that is… .","Sunderland crashed out of the FA Cup to Bradford on Sunday .

"Amir Khan will give Floyd Mayweather a matter of days, rather than a year, to decide whether his next fight will be against the rejuvenated star of British boxing. Khan is not holding his breath. Nor does he expect Sheffield’s Kell Brook to go through with the world title fight which could lead to one of those battles of Britain the home fans love. Landing: Amir Khan was back to his best in defeating Luis Collazo in Las Vegas on Saturday night . No go: Khan is not confident of facing Floyd Mayweather (left) or Kell Brook (right) before the end of the year . All of . which complicates Khan’s future planning following his brilliant victory . over the experienced Luis Collazo in Las Vegas on Saturday night. Mayweather, who dug deep to protect his unbeaten record against Marcos Maidana in a thriller atop the same bill in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, is being asked if he will reschedule his next fight from September to November to give Khan adequate training time after he fasts during Ramadan. The reluctance of Mayweather to answer that question makes Khan suspect that the world’s No 1 fighter is wary of the speed which bedazzled Collazo. Mayweather is much happier discussing a re-match with Maidana, even though talks with team Khan began in Vegas. But Khan, having wasted a year in in the dashed expectation of fighting Mayweather this weekend, is not prepared to wait again. He says: ‘Now I’m back in business I need another meaningful fight in the autumn. I want to get it sorted in principle in the next couple of weeks. ‘I think people have been warning Floyd about my speed. He is a great boxer but as he gets older and slows down a little I think he knows I can give him problems, being as quick as I am.’ As for Brook, who has been calling him out, Khan has always said that the man from Sheffield needs to prove himself at elite level, preferably by winning a world title. Brook has been nominated by the IBF as the mandatory challenger to their welterweight champion Shawn Porter but Khan says: ‘I don’t believe Kell will take that fight.  Not only is Porter tough and dangerous but Brook has a lot of confidence issues. ‘A source close to his camp tells me that Kell keeps asking if this is the right time for him, if he’s ready for such a difficult fight. It’s like he’s already lost that fight in his head.’ Other November alternatives for Khan would be a re-match of his own against one of the two rivals who knocked his career off track for a while, Lamont Peterson or Danny Garcia. He says: ‘I would love the chance to put the record straight with both of them.’ But his preoccupation is with Mayweather, even if they both have to come through additional fights later this year before meeting next May:  ‘I will feel unfulfilled if the fight doesn’t happen. You always want to take on the best. Gather round: Khan speaks to the UK press the day after his victory over Collazo in Las Vegas . Bish, bash, bosh: Khan was dominant as he made a claim to be Mayweather's next opponent . Party time: Khan celebrates his victory over Collazo in what was his first fight in more than a year . Amir Khan is 13/2 to beat Floyd Mayweather if the two meet in the ring. Mayweather is 1/12 with the draw priced at 33/1. Click here to bet with Coral. ‘Not only that but I think they can give the people what they want, namely Floyd’s first defeat. It feels that the public have grown tired of him, even the Americans. When I talk to taxi drivers here or people come up to me at dinner, it seems they hate him now.’ Mayweather who is planning a trip to England next month - apparently part business, part pleasure –  and has told Khan he would like to meet  up with him. But Khan says: ‘I don’t think he’ll be coming to Bolton. I guess I would have to go down to London.’ The improvements Khan has made during eight months working with new trainer Virgil Hunter may not be helping his pursuit of Mayweather. Not only has he tightened the defence of his chin but he has learned to meet like with like if an opponent fights dirty. As Collazo realised he was being out-classed he threw deliberate low blows, among other infractions of the rules. Khan says: ‘I had to get into the holding and elbowing as well. The days of only trading clean shots are long gone in boxing. You have to get down and dirty if necessary.’ The mighty Mayweather revealed the same philosophy as he dealt with Maidana’s relentless attempts to rough him up and Khan adds: ‘Floyd is very clever at holding and the use of his elbow, forearm and the inside of the glove. That’s another reason why fighting him would be very difficult – like a physical chess match between us – but I really do think I am the one who can prevent him going through his career undefeated.’ After his performance against Collazo there will be less scoffing at Khan’s self-confidence, whoever he fights next. Tough night: Marcos Maidana gave Mayweather a fight before losing by majority decision at the MGM Grand . Rough and tumble: Maidana did not give Mayweather a minute's peace over their 12-round battle . Oscar De La Hoya’s dramatic re-emergence from drink and drugs rehab is raising hope that he can put an end to the cold war between rival promoters which is preventing so many potentially great fights taking place. One of his first actions has been to call a truce with Bob Arum after years of bitterness between their respective corporations. This has caused a schism within Golden Boy, whose chief executive Richard Schaefer has vowed never to return to doing business with Arum, whose Top Rank company boast Manny Pacquiao as their flagship fighter. Schaefer is considering his future and may move to Mayweather Promotions, for whom Golden Boy are operating partners. De La Hoya and former banker Schaefer have built Golden Boy into boxing’s biggest promoters and as the former Olympic and world champion returned to the public spotlight hours before Floyd Mayweather’s fight with Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas, he said: ‘No-one is dismissing Richard and I want him to continue making great fights like this one, which is his job. Happier times: Richard Schaefer (left) and Oscar De La Hoya have been at loggerheads in recent weeks . ‘But I have a vision of where this company can grow and no-one will stop me realising it.  If we can work with Arum it will be good for boxing, so why not?’ Schaefer cites problems in the past and there is talk of a power struggle but De La Hoya says: ‘I want to offer an olive branch to Richard. I want him to stay. But I have to look after myself, my family and the good of boxing, this sport I love. ‘Our company is not called Golden Boy for nothing. I am the president and the major shareholder.’ His peace-making with Arum will have the support of boxing fans the world over, even if a long-awaited super-fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao is not a consequence. Mayweather is in effect his own promoter and he continues to refuse to work with Arum. But there are a lot of other exciting match-ups to be made between the rival stables of boxers. Manny Pacquiao v Amir Khan, for starters. The football-like crush as a crowd of some 16,000 charged their way out of the MGM Grand Garden on Saturday night had been an accident waiting to happen. More than 20 people, several of them children, were hurt and taken to hospital after panic set in. By luck, none of the injuries were serious but the incident highlights exit problems at this arena. There has been a lot of pushing and surging after several fights here, as the spectators funnel out of multiple doors into a comparatively narrow indoor walk-way to the casino. There was also a warning the afternoon before when hundreds of fans hoping to see the weigh-in arrived after the arena was full and were caught up in that bottle-neck. False reports of a gun-shot – after a bollard crashed to the floor   - aggravated the situation on fight night. The organisers could do worse than consult English authorities who have become expert at controlling football crowds.

"Roy Hodgson has confirmed Wayne Rooney will stay as a striker for England, adding that it doesn't matter where he plays for Manchester United.

'At the moment I'd like to see him as a key figure for us as a centre forward and it would take a lot before I’d start to think along those lines [Rooney as a midfielder].

Robert Burt, 19, was caught driving while under the influence of alcohol and without a license back in June and ordered to spend two days in prison in August. He decided to show up for his sentence at the Somerset County Jail in an orange t-shirt featuring his booking shot from the original arrest with the caption: 'Burt Family Reunion 8/8 - 8/10/2014.' Seeing double:  Maine man was arrested and posed for a mugshot wearing a t-shirt printed with his previous mugshot on it . According to The Smoking Gun, the caption refers to a relative of Burt's who is also serving time at the prison. Burt's orange t-shirt was made for him by some thoughtful co-workers. According to his Facebook page, he works at Vittles Restaurant in Pittsfield. Burt, who lists his past academic studies as 'alternitve (sic) education,' says Somerset County corrections officers were in on the joke. He wrote on Facebook that they made him hold the slate in such a way 'so you could see the shirt.' 'They laughed there (sic) asses off haha,' he wrote.

"A bitter war of words broke out today over David Cameron's plan to cap the number of immigrants moving to Britain from Europe. European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said it was 'quite clear' that restrictions on foreign workers would be illegal under EU law and said the matter was not up for negotiation. Tory chairman Grant Shapps reacted furiously to Mr Barroso’s remarks. He said: ‘It’s extraordinary for an unelected bureaucrat to dismiss Britain, which will be the second largest economy in Europe next year. I think he is out of touch with the main stream public opinion in Britain.’ Scroll down for video . Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, poured cold water on Tory plans to restrict EU immigration into the UK . Grant Shapps, Conservative Party Chairman,  said Mr Barroso was 'out of touch with the main stream public opinion in Britain' Mr Cameron has pledged to make immigration reform the centrepiece of his planned renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels ahead of an in-out EU vote in 2017. Plans are being drawn up to slash EU migration by imposing an annual cap on the number of national insurance numbers given to immigrants, it was reported this morning. Under Mr Cameron's proposal migrants would only get national insurance number for a limited time – meaning they would find it harder to move to Britain permanently and claim benefits. Currently anyone from the EU can move to Britain and apply for a national insurance number. Cabinet sources told The Sunday Times the cap will be a centrepiece of Mr Cameron's planned speech announcing his 'red lines' for immigration reform as the price of Britain staying in the EU. Mr Cameron wants to set the cap to ensure net migration falls below 100,000 a year – the pledge he made at the last election. Net migration hit 243,000 in the year to March. But Mr Barroso – the outgoing EU Commission President – dismissed the proposal out of hand this morning. Mr Barroso said it was a 'clear' principle within the EU that everyone had the right to move for work . Ukip leader Nigel Farage said Mr Barroso had made it 'crystal clear' that leaving the EU was the only way to get full control over immigration . Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show he said: 'Any kind of arbitrary cap seems to me to be not in conformity with European rules because for us it's very important the principle of non-discrimination. 'The freedom of movement is a very important principle in the internal market, the movement of goods, of capital, of services and of people.' He said the fundamental importance of free movement was 'quite clear'. 'In principle arbitrary caps seem to me in contradiction with European Union rules. That's quite clear from my point of view.' Mr Barroso criticised Mr Hammond for saying the UK was 'lighting a fire' beneath the EU through the Tories' plans for an EU referendum. 'I am told that the Foreign Secretary was before the minister of defence and I think this reference to fire and weapons is more appropriate for defence than a foreign secretary. 'It's very important to have a positive tone regarding these issues between Britain and the European Union.' David Cameron is working on plans to cap EU migration . But Mr Shapps dismissed the EU remarks. He said: ‘Barroso’s only the latest person from Europe to tell us we’ll never get what we want. ‘But remember, we were never going to get the rebate that Margaret Thatcher successfully got - we were never going to get to pull back powers but we’ve done that for a whole lot of competences; we were never going to get a cut in the EU budget, people said that was impossible, but David Cameron’s negotiated that. There are lots of impossible things that we’ve managed to do in Europe.” Mr Shapps confirmed the Prime Minister would be setting out the Conservative plans to cut immigration in coming weeks. It comes after the PM launched a fresh effort to try to persuade would-be Ukip voters to back the Tories, warning that it would be a 'terrible irony' if voting for Nigel Farage's party let Ed Miliband take the keys to No 10. The Prime Minister said voters should not be 'deceived' into thinking that it was anything other than a 'stark choice' between the Conservatives and Labour at the next election. Next May's general election would be 'the most important for a generation', the Prime Minister said in an article for the Sunday Telegraph, telling voters it would be a straight contest between him and Mr Miliband to run the country. In a message to wavering Tories, he said: 'Let no-one deceive you that there is a third way. A vote for Ukip is a vote for Labour. 'That much was proved in the recent by-elections. In Clacton, previously a Conservative seat, Ukip won. In Heywood and Middleton, Labour held their seat. 'And to those considering voting for Ukip on the issues of immigration and Europe, I would point you to our Conservative record. 'Non-EU migration is now at its lowest levels since the 1990s - and we are committed to putting EU migration right at the heart of our negotiations in Europe. 'That comes from the first British prime minister ever to veto an EU Treaty, get the European budget cut, and pull us out of the bail-out schemes that Labour signed us up to. 'We have also pledged to scrap Labour's Human Rights Act, ending the era of farcical human rights rulings handed down from Europe. And never forget: it is only the Conservative Party that is offering you that in-out referendum on Europe in 2017. 'There would be a terrible irony if people who care about these issues voted Ukip - making a Labour Government more likely.' The Prime Minister warned that letting Mr Milband into No 10 would result in a 'great nation slipping back into decline', with households facing rising mortgage bills and jobs being moved overseas. He said: 'A Labour Britain hardly bears thinking about. Imagine: the international markets wincing as the British government racks up more debt; interest rates and mortgage rates going up; businesses crushed under punishing taxes; jobs leaving our shores; the unions back in Downing Street; diktats and bureaucratic schemes raining down on our schools and hospitals; the sense of a great nation slipping back into decline.' Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: 'Why should anyone believe the Prime Minister when he has a record of making big promises on immigration and not delivering, when everyone knows he wants headlines for the Rochester and Strood by-election, and when the briefing from the Government keeps changing every couple of days?'","Jose Manuel Barroso said free movement was a 'fundamental principle'

"It is hard to comprehend the size our galaxy, but now Nasa has created an incredible panoramic view of the Milky Way that you can tour by clicking a button. The star-studded panorama is made up of over two million infrared images taken over the last decade by the space agency’s Spitzer Space Telescope. If the image was printed out, a billboard as large as a stadium would be needed to display it, so instead the impressive collection of images can be explored online. Scroll down for video . A panorama from Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope shows us our galaxy's plane all the way around us in infrared light. The 360-degree mosaic consists of more than 2 million snapshots taken in infrared light over 10 years, beginning in 2003 when Spitzer launched . The zoomable 360° ‘mosaic’ was unveiled at the TEDActive 2014 conference in Vancouver and is part of the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (Glimpse360) project, which is mapping the plane of our galaxy from all directions. It captures about three per cent of our sky, but because it focuses on a band around Earth where the plane of the Milky Way lies, it shows more than half of all the galaxy's stars. ‘If we actually printed this out, we'd need a billboard as big as the Rose Bowl Stadium to display it,’ said Robert Hurt, an imaging specialist at Nasa's Spitzer Space Science Centre in Pasadena, California. ‘Instead, we've created a digital viewer that anyone, even astronomers, can use.’ The Spitzer Space Telescope was launched in 2003 and has spent more than 10 years studying everything from asteroids in our solar system to the most remote galaxies at the edge of the observable universe. The centre of the Milky Way galaxy imaged by Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope is displayed on a high-definition 23-foot-wide (7metre) LCD screen at the space agency's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California . It has spent 172 days or 4,142 hours taking pictures of the plane of the Milky Way in infrared light, but this is the first time that the images have been stitched together to form a panoramic view. The Milky Way is a flat spiral disk and our solar system sits in the outer third of the galaxy in one of its spiral arms. When astronomers look towards the centre of our galaxy they see a crowded region packed full of stars and visible-light telescope cannot look very far into the area because the amount of dust increases with distance, blocking visible starlight. Infrared light, however, travels through the dust and allows Spitzer to view past the galaxy's centre. ‘Spitzer is helping us determine where the edge of the galaxy lies,’ said Ed Churchwell, co-leader of the Glimpse team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ‘We are mapping the placement of the spiral arms and tracing the shape of the galaxy.’ Using the data from the telescope has enabled astronomers to create the most accurate map of the large central collection of stars that marks the centre of the galaxy, showing that the Milky Way is slightly larger than previously thought. The data has also revealed that the Milky Way is riddled with bubble structures – cavities around huge stars – which blast wind and radiation into their surroundings. Experts at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory explained that Spitzer can also see faint stars in the ‘back country’ of our galaxy - the outer, darker regions that went largely unexplored before. ‘There are a whole lot more lower-mass stars seen now with Spitzer on a large scale, allowing for a grand study,’ said Barbara Whitney of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, co-leader of the Glimpse team. ‘Spitzer is sensitive enough to pick these up and light up the entire 'countryside' with star formation,’ she added. The 360 degree view of the Milky Way will be used to guide Nasa’s upcoming James Webb Space Telescope to the most interesting sites of star-formation, where it will make more detailed infrared observations. The Glimpse data has also revealed that the Milky Way is riddled with bubble structures, which are cavities around huge stars that blast wind and radiation into their surroundings. This infrared image shows a striking example of what is called a hierarchical bubble structure, in which one giant bubble, carved into the dust of space by massive stars, has triggered the formation of smaller bubbles (all circled)","Star-studded panorama is composed of two million infrared images taken over 10 years by Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope .

"Clearly and concisely, victim Brienna Campos, 20, told emergency responders where she was, if she was OK, and how two men broke into her home and killed her friend. 'We didn't see him move, so I'm pretty sure he got a clean shot in the head and he's dead,' Miss Campos told the operator. 'I can only think that they [the shooters] are probably linked to the people that robbed us last time.' Armed men had only moments before broken into Miss Campos' Ocoee home, pulled the residents from their beds and lined them up for execution one by one. Miss Campos and her brother Remington Campos, 23, survived the shots to their heads, but their roommate Alex Zaldivar, 19, did not. Murdered: Alex Zaldivar, 19, was fatally shot in the head by home invaders. At least two men broke into his house on September 10 and lined up him and two friends and shot them, execution style . 'Miraculous': Siblings Remington Campos, left, and Brienna Campos, right, were also shot in the head during the home invasion but survived. They stumbled to a neighbour's home for help . The Orlando Sentinel obtained the three-minute long recording after a public information request. The attack took place the morning of September 10, the day before Miss and Mr Campos were scheduled to testify against Bessman Okafor and Nolan Bernard for a break-in that took place in May. The victims believe the home invasion was an attempt to execute the residents of the home while so they could not testify. Miss Campos maintained her composure throughout the call, detailing her miraculous escape. 'I ran out the backdoor to a neighbor's house,' she says. 'Literally, within minutes ago.' Her neighbor can be heard tending to the girl's wounds, putting a towel on her head to soak up the blood. She told the operator that she was woken up by a loud noise downstairs. 'I'm pretty sure they kicked in the door because I heard a noise [and] the dogs started barking,' she recalled. 'I was sleeping in my undergarments so I got in my closet and put on a pair of shorts and I hear another kick and it's a guy shoving a pistol in my face.' She added 'I barely got pants on.' She also described how the two men wore all black, using t-shirts as a mask to conceal their identities. Scene: It was the second home invasion at the friends' Ocoee home, pictured. Their family believes one of the men from an earlier break-in returned to the house to kill the witnesses . 'We saw them go out the door on foot, but I'm sure they probably had a vehicle somewhere down the road,' Miss Campos said. 'I don't see them sticking around for too long after they had three gunshots go off in my living room.' As officers sirens draw nearer, one can hear Miss Campos inspecting her wound. 'I can't tell if that's like brain or what... sick,' she said, disgusted with the situation. After the call, police tracked 27-year-old Bessman Okafor and 26-year-old Nolan Bernard at a home in west Orange County, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Okafor was out of jail on bond for the burglary and an electronic monitor showed he was not at home during the time of the invasion. Bernard was in the Orange County Jail. So far, no one has been charged with the home invasion. Did they do it? Bessman Okafor, left, was out on . bond following the May break-in and his electronic tag shows he was not . at home during the second break in. Nolan Bernard, right, was also . charged in May . 'They were trying to execute them all because they were going to testify the very next day,' Zaldivar's father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'They came here and executed him like a dog. The friends' home in Ocoee, Florida was targeted for the second time on September 10 at 5.15 a.m. Police believe two or three suspects kicked down the locked front door and started pulling the friends from their beds and lining them up in the living room. Brienna, whose room was nearest the front door, was scrambling to put on clothes when the intruders dragged her out and put her face-down on the floor. Her brother Remington was pulled from . his bed, pistol-whipped and pushed next to his sister, he told his . parents. Alex was then forced alongside them. Terrifying: Alex, left, had reached over for the hand of Brienna, right, and her brother to tell them he loved them before he was shot dead in his living room. The siblings are now in hiding . Fearing his life was about to end, Alex grabbed the hands of his two friends and told . them he loved them - before the suspects kicked apart their hands and . started shooting, the parents said. Brienna was shot first but remained conscious, sparking one of the men to ask: 'Did you miss?' She played dead and listened as her brother and friend were shot, her father said. They fired at Alex multiple times, including at least once in the back of the head. Remington was shot once in the head, but also miraculously survived. The men left and after Brienna failed . to find a phone, she stumbled with her brother through the back door . and over a fence to a neighbour's house, leaving a trail of blood behind . them. The . Campos siblings survived and are now in hiding. They are certain their . attackers were the also behind the May invasion, but police have not yet . made any arrests in the latest case. The two men, Okafor and Nolan Darnell Bernard, were . scheduled to stand trial on September 11, the day after the shooting, . and Alex and Brienna were listed as possible witnesses. One suspect, 27-year-old . Okafor was out on bond with a tag. He left his home at 4.40 a.m. the . morning of the shootings and returned at 5:46 a.m., court records . reveal. He was arrested for violating the terms of his release but has not been charged in the shootings. The . parents of the victims returned to the home on Monday to sweep up their . children's dry blood and tell their version of events. 'It's a miracle my children survived, ' Alfonso Campos, who owns the home, said. Alex, . who was studying business at a nearby community college, was buried in . Gotha. He leaves behind his parents and big brother, Raf. Loss: The families said they would fight for justice for Alex, left, who was buried last week, right . Alfonso Compos said his children will now fight to put their friend's killers behind bars. 'They will not be afraid to keep on going and bring justice,' he said. 'We don't want his death to be in vain,' Rafael Zaldivar added. 'They executed him like a dog. They were cowards, . complete cowards.' Friends and family are now rallying for Alex's voice to be heard, setting up community groups calling for justice and signing petitions to make breaking out on bond harder for suspects. On a Facebook group, they write that Okafor has a history of violence and crime - 17 criminal charges since he was 16. 'How could [the judge] let such a violent criminal with a record like this go with a soft slap on the wrist?' they write. 'None of this would have happened if Okafor were still in prison where he clearly belongs.'","Men broke into Florida home on September 10 - a day before the friends were to appear in court to testify in case for earlier home invasion .

"She was married to him just 18 months when he shot and killed John Lennon and faced the possibility of life behind bars. But 31 years later and Mark Chapman's wife's loyalty shows so signs of wavering. Gloria Hiroko Chapman married her notorious husband in 1979, the year before he shot the Beatles star outside his Dakota apartment building in New York. He has been denied parole six times, and is up again in front of the board this week. Yet still, Gloria remains a faithful wife, visiting her husband regularly. Seventh parole: Chapman has lost a considerable amount of weight since he has been incarcerated - perhaps he has been upping his exercise in preparation for his conjugal visits? Loyalty: Mark Chapman's wife Gloria has steadfastly stood by her man for the last 31 years, regularly visiting him in prison for conjugal visits . The 57-year-old requested that he be . allowed conjugal visits with his wife in his current prison - which would take place in a trailer devoid of guards and cameras. The request was granted . yesterday. According to the New York Daily News, Chapman had participated in the so-called 'family reunion' program when . he was an inmate at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility. When he was transferred in May to . Wende state prison in Genesee County - also a maximum security prison, . he had to reapply for the privilege. State prison system spokesman . Peter Cutle said: 'He followed . the standard procedures and protocols in our system, and his request . for participation was approved.' The program allows Chapman to be . allowed to spend up to 48 hours in a trailer with his wife on prison . grounds - which has a kitchenette, living room and two bedrooms. It is . free of prison guards and cameras. His stepfather will also be able to visit. Mr Cutler said . of the program: 'We know it has beneficial impact on the inmate both for their behavior . on the inside and for their eventual reentry into society.' Wife: Gloria Hiroko Chapman will be allowed to spend 48 hours in a trailer at state prison in Genesee County with her husband, who she married in 1979 . Chapman married his wife Gloria Hiroko Chapman in 1979. Gloria, a Japanese-American and former travel agent, married Chapman in Hawaii in June 1979, 18 months before he gunned down Lennon while he was signing an autograph for him. According to the New York Daily News, who interviewed Mrs Chapman in 2008 at her single-story, bluish-gray house in the Honolulu suburb of Kailua, the couple have been enjoying these conjugal visits for the last 20 years. She now works in a hospital in the quiet town of Kailua, 15 miles from Honolulu, and lives in the hospital-owned property across the street with two other women. Thirty years after the death of Lennon, Mrs Chapman revealed that her husband told her of his plan to kill The Beatles' singer and even showed her the gun he was going to use. But tapes of interviews with Gloria said that rather than go to police or get help for her mentally-ill husband, she trusted herself to help him through it. In an interview after his conviction, Chapman actually blamed his wife for not doing . more to prevent the killing. He said: 'It's crazy. I laid out the gun . and I laid out all five bullets - she'd never seen a gun before. And I . said this is what I was going to do. 'My God, I still have deep-seated . resentment that she didn't go to somebody, even the police, and say, . ""Look, my husband's bought a gun and he says he's going to kill John . Lennon"".' He later said had waged an unsuccessful battle with 'little people' inside his head who told him to kill Lennon. Following his arrest and conviction, Gloria quit her job as a travel agent and dedicated herself to a life in reparation, helping others. New York Department of Corrections . member Linda Foglia said the parole board will make a decision on . whether to release Lennon's murderer by Friday. Chapman shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the 40-year-old former Beatle lived. He was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. John Lennon signs Mark Chapman's copy of 'Double Fantasy' outside the Dakota Building hours before Chapman opened fire on the former Beatle and killed him . The Dakota Apartments where British Musician and former Beatle John Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman on 08 December 1980 in New York City . Chapman was denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008. He was last up for parole in 2010, but this was denied because his 'discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,' said the New York State Division of Parole. Chapman is currently being held in protective custody in a single-person cell and is allowed out for three hours each day. Following his transfer from Attica, Chapman applied to participate in a program called 'family reunion' which allows incarcerated inmates to spend more time with their family members. Distraught fans of ex-Beatle John Lennon gather outside his apartment building on December 8, after he was gunned down by a man identified as Mark David Chapman, 25, of Hawaii . Yoko Ono (centre) has requested that Mark Chapman not be granted parole in an email to the New York Department of Corrections . On his application for parole in 2010, Chapman said that he killed the much-loved musician because he wanted 'instant notoriety.' 'I made a horrible decision to end another human being's life, for reasons of selfishness, and that was my decision at that time,' said Mark David Chapman in 2010. 'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody, and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies.' Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, in previous years has submitted a letter requesting that parole be denied. Her attorney reiterated her position in an email to CNN Saturday.","Mark Chapman has been in prison for 31-years after killing the former Beatle in December 1980 .

"India's Virat Kohli continued his love affair with the Adelaide Oval when he scored his 22nd one-day century to drive India to a 76-run win over Pakistan yesterday. The 26-year-old has now scored four centuries in five Tests and one-day games at the Oval. 'I want to wrap up this ground and take it home,' Kohli said after his 107. 'This has been a special ground for me.' Virat Kohli looks to the skies as he commends his century in India's Cricket World Cup win in Pakistan . Kohli described the Adelaide Oval as 'special' following his fourth century in five apperances . Kohli, who hit eight fours in his 126-ball knock, had stands of 129 with opener Shikhar Dhawan and 110 with Suresh Raina as India made 300 for seven despite Sohail Khan's five for 55. Pakistan were the architects of their own downfall as they slipped from 102 for two to 224 all out. Kohli's 22nd century in his 143rd innings put him joint fourth on the list of most one-day centuries alongside his former captain Sourav Ganguly, who took 300 attempts to accumulate as many. Virat Kohli celebrates after scoring his century for India in the Cricket World Cup match against Pakistan . Only Sachin Tendulkar (49 centuries from 452 innings), Ricky Ponting (30 from 365) and Sanath Jayasuriya (28 from 433) are above him in the list. South Africa's David Miller and JP Duminy both hit unbeaten centuries as they enjoyed a record World Cup fifth-wicket partnership in a 62-run win over Zimbabwe. Their stand of 256 runs in less than 30 overs helped their team reach 339 for four in their Pool B contest in Hamilton with Miller scoring 138 not out off 92 balls, including 30 off the 48th over, and Duminy 115 off 100 balls. Zimbabwe could only manage 277 all out in reply.

"Former Australia seamer Glenn McGrath has lamented the standard of death bowling in the early stages of the World Cup. England coach Peter Moores admitted his bowlers needed to improve after they conceded 105 runs in the final 10 overs during their opening defeat to Australia. But England's problems have been put into some context by the fact that the average number of runs scored in the final 10 overs, when completed, in the opening five games of the World Cup is a whopping 112 runs. Glenn McGrath (centre) won three World Cups with Australia during his stellar One Day International career . McGrath celebrates a wicket, and the Aussie legend insists his method of bowling would still work . Australia's equal leading one-day international wicket-taker McGrath believes bowlers have forgotten the 'art' of a yorker at the death and suggested he would have been able to combat new-age shots such as ramps and reverse sweeps. 'It still comes down to execution. In the final 10 overs if you can bowl good yorkers at will, and pretty much hit them, then you are going to be successful,' McGrath, a three-time World Cup winner, told Cricket Australia's website. 'It seems that because people have put the ramp in that bowling yorkers at the death is a dying art, which just bewilders me. 'The new shots have come in but I felt that I probably could have combated that. Bowling comes back to executing and being able to bowl the ball where you want to bowl. 'If you can do that you are going to be successful in any era.' Moores conceded after England's 111-run defeat to Australia that his side had under-used the yorker. However, the 52-year-old believes his bowlers' greatest crime was not bowling to their field as they were instead lulled into a shorter length to try to make Australia hit to the longer boundaries on the off and leg sides at the MCG. England's bowlers struggled at the death against Australia, conceding 105 runs in the final ten overs . Steven Finn puts his head in his hands after conceding more runs to Glenn Maxwell in Melbourne . 'The yorker is a really good ball, but you've got to bowl the right ball to the right field,' Moores said. 'If you look at the stats for the best in world cricket, they don't just bowl yorkers - but they do bowl yorkers. They bowl simple plans. '(Australia pace bowler Mitchell) Starc is a yorker bowler, but some are not and they bowl a heavy length with slower balls. You have to go to your strengths. 'So we have certain bowlers who lend themselves to going full with yorkers; others won't use it quite as much.' England play their second game against New Zealand on Friday in the smaller surrounds of the Westpac Stadium - which is primarily a rugby venue - and in the coming days Moores is set make clarifying his bowlers' plans in the late overs a priority. 'We have to go away, look at that and decide what are we going to do?' he said. Peter Moores says his bowlers will have to bowl better if England are to make an impression at the World Cup . 'How are we going to get clear on that? We have to move and we have to move fast because these games are going to keep coming - and the last 10 to 15 overs aren't going to go away.' Moores will tell his bowlers not to try to double bluff the New Zealand batsmen who, with the likes of Corey Anderson and Luke Ronchi down the order, have built a reputation in for big hitting late. 'The key for whoever bowls at that time is to be clear and committed in what they're trying to do - and then bowl to their field,' Moores said. 'Now that's a tough thing. There are only four men out, rather than five, so that's harder and what I don't think you do is try to double bluff people. 'You bowl to the field you've set and back your skill levels to get the ball in the right area to make it very difficult for them to get past the boundary man.'","Final ten overs of innings are averaging over 100 runs so far .

"Former England captain Michael Vaughan is worried by the malaise of current one-day skipper Eoin Morgan and believes the team look like 'startled rabbits'. Morgan made his third duck in four ODIs as England opened their World Cup campaign with a thumping 111-run defeat to co-hosts Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Vaughan, the 2005 Ashes-winning captain, thinks Morgan's current form has changed his mindset but he has urged the Irishman to go back to basics. England captain Eoin Morgan made his third duck in four ODIs as England lost to Australia . A dejected Morgan walks past Australia as they celebrate taking his wicket during the World Cup match . 'When Morgan first came into the England side, he did not think. He just watched the ball and tried to hit it. At the moment, he looks like he is trying to play a technical game,' Vaughan wrote in his column in the Daily Telegraph. 'He is almost trying to get himself in too much. The last thing he needs is to go into his shell and think that he has to play a captain's innings. 'I want to see the old Eoin Morgan back. He used to take risks. He was the X-factor player. I would tell him to go away over the next few days, hit some balls and rediscover that free spirit we have all enjoyed watching in one-day cricket.' Vaughan is troubled by the most recent setback ahead of their next match against the fancied New Zealand this Friday. He added: 'The worrying sign is that England look like startled rabbits. 'Did I expect England to compete? Absolutely. They did not, and that is a real concern. I thought they would lose, but I did not expect them to lose in this fashion. 'And the problem with losing in this fashion is that there are so many players who are now out of form. They play New Zealand in Wellington on Friday, and somehow they have to produce.'

"A grand jury voted to indict the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey 13 years ago, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it was revealed today. The six-year-old was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado, on Boxing Day in 1996. For years, her parents John and Patsy Ramsey, remained suspects until finally being exonerated in 2008. No-one has ever been convicted. Cold case: John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, were indicted by a grand jury over her death, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it has been revealed . Unsolved: Six-year-old JonBenet was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado, on Christmas Day in 1996 . Now it has been revealed that a Colorado grand jury voted to indict the Ramseys in 1999 on charges of child abuse resulting in death, a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison. But sources, including members of the grand jury, told the Boulder Daily Camera that District Attorney Alex Hunter refused to sign the indictment vote, apparently believing he could not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and never revealed the result. Instead he announced the end of investigation, saying: 'I and my prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant a filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time.' A lawyer for John Ramsey has praised the decision. Attorney Bryan Morgan said: 'If what you report actually happened, then there were some very professional and brave people in Alex’s office.' It is unclear whether the DA acted properly in not signing the indictment. However, one expert told the paper that in her opinion proper legal procedure would have been to sign the document and file it with the court before going to open court to dismiss the charges. 'Last picture': JonBenet with her mother, apparently on the morning of her death. Her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008 . Horrific: JonBenet was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth . Hunter, who left office in 2001 after . 28 years as Boulder County's district attorney, declined to discuss the . grand jury's actions. But he released a statement last week . to the Boulder Daily Camera, saying: 'Colorado statutes, the ethical . canons which govern the practice of law, and the Boulder District . Court's oaths, instructions and orders in the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury . proceedings, are well established and absolutely clear with respect to . the various participants' legal obligations, duties and . responsibilities, including the inviolate secrecy of the proceedings and . the differing burdens of proof applicable to jurors and prosecutors. 'As the duly elected district . attorney at the time and as an officer of the court then and now, I must . respectfully decline further comment.' Defending accusations: Patsy and John Ramsey hold a picture of their daughter during a press conference in 2000 where they released the results of an independent lie detector test, which revealed they had no knowledge of who killed their daughter . Cold case: John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, were indicted by a grand jury over her death, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it has been revealed . Christmas Day, 1996: Parents of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey receive a ransom note demanding $118,000 . Boxing Day, 1996: JonBenet found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado . Boulder Police quickly placed her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, under an 'umbrella of suspicion' but they were never formally named as suspects . Detectives were later . criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by . concentrating on the family . 2003: DNA taken from the victim's clothes suggests the family were not involved . 2006: Patsy Ramsey dies of ovarian cancer . August 2006: Former teacher John Mark Karr reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges. But no murder charge brought after his DNA found not to match that on JonBenet's body . 2008: Boulder district attorney's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology . February 2009: Boulder Police Department takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation . On Christmas Day of 1996, the family . received a ransom note saying that JonBenet had been kidnapped and were . demanding $118,000 - the amount of a bonus Mr Ramsey had recently . received - or else she would be beheaded. But it was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house. Her . wrists were tied above her head, and she had duct tape over her mouth. An autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to . death. Within hours, the Ramseys themselves . became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later . criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by . concentrating on the family - including JonBenet's brother Burke - . instead of following up other leads. For . the next 12 years, the blame for their daughter's death - who was given . the name Little Miss Sunshine - lay largely on their shoulders as they . fought to clear their name and find the real killer. Eventually, Boulder district attorney’s office completely cleared the Ramseys of any wrongdoing in their daughter’s slaying and issued an apology in 2008. Since then, John Ramsey has kept the memory of his daughter alive, despite losing his reputation, a thriving business and Patsy to ovarian cancer in 2006. Mr Ramsey eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer Jan Rousseaux, who he married at a private ceremony in Charlevoix, Michigan, in July 2011. Basement case: This 1996 police video shows the basement hours after JonBenet's body was discovered . Last year, a former detective officially broke his silence over the investigation, saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child's toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high-profile cold case. In his self-published book, Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet Ramsey?, former detective Jim Kolar reveals thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports. He said he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain, and has a theory that a children’s toy could be responsible for the marks on JonBenet’s back. Mr Ramsey, told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement. But in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after JonBenet was found dead, Koler pointed out that there are wispy cobwebs, moving ever so slightly. Koler speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the Ramsey’s residence and thus JonBenet’s killer would have already been inside the house.","JonBenet, 6, found bludgeoned to death at home on Christmas Day, 1996 .

"A teenager suffered three heart attacks and temporarily 'died' on her bathroom floor after she downed ten high-caffeine Jagerbombs on a 'two-for-one' promotion night. Jayde Dinsdale, 18, was drinking the Jagermeister spirit and energy drink shooter, which cost £2.20 for two, on a night out with friends, in Yeovil, Somerset. But as the alcohol wore off, the high levels of caffeine in her system took control of her heart rate - causing it to accelerate dangerously out of control, medics have since said. Scroll down for video . Jayde Dinsdale in hospital after she was put into a coma following a night out where she drank 10 Jagerbombs and suffered three heart attacks . Miss Dinsdale, 18, downed the shots - made of Jagermeister spirit and energy drink - on a two-for-one night out with pals. But after the alcohol wore off the caffeine in her system took control of her heart rate - causing it to accelerate dangerously out of control . Her family believe the drinks caused her heart rate to race out of control. The blonde teenager was placed into a medically induced coma for 52 hours and spent three weeks in hospital . Her parents desperately performed CPR on their daughter as she suffered two cardiac arrests at home in their bathroom. Miss . Dinsdale - who had another heart attack in the following hours - was . put into an induced coma and spent three weeks in hospital before medics . fitted an internal defibrillator. She is now warning other young . people to avoid the drinks which combine a shot of spirit . Jagermeister and half a can of energy drink. One can of energy drink typically contains 80mg of caffeine, around the same as two cans of cola and slightly less than a mug of instant coffee. Miss Dinsdale said: 'I think it is pretty bad that people sell these drinks. Her parents desperately performed CPR on their daughter as she suffered two cardiac arrests at home in their bathroom . 'You've no idea how much caffeine is in them and how dangerous they can be. 'I hope people will think twice about drinking energy drinks – they could be deadly.' The teenager arrived at the nightclub sober just before midnight on January 31, having just finished work as a party rep. She said she thinks she had around ten drinks - each containing half a can of energy drink - before heading home at 2am. Eight . hours later, Jayde was washing her face while talking to mother . Natalie, 38, when she suddenly started shaking and collapsed. Mrs Dinsdale said: 'She was her normal bubbly self and was telling me about the night while in the bathroom. 'Then all of a sudden her chest jolted and she fell to the floor and hit her head on the bath and radiator. 'I put her in the recovery position and stabilised her, but she started having another fit. I screamed for my husband. Miss Dinsdale showing the scar where she had an internal defibrillator fitted . 'Her pulse was very faint and she started to go purple. 'She was dead on the bathroom floor – it’s a miracle that Jayde is still with us.' Father . Darryl, 38, performed CPR he learned from the Vinnie Jones British . Heart Foundation advert, while Eliesha, 12, held her sister’s head. Miss . Dinsdale was taken to the intensive care unit at Yeovil District . Hospital where she was put in a 52-hour coma to protect her brain and . heart after she suffered a third arrest. Her body was cooled to just 32 degrees to protect her brain and her family faced an agonising wait to see if she would recover. Mrs Dinsdale said: 'She was covered in tubes. Nothing can prepare you for seeing your child like that.' When . she came to she was fitted with an implantable cardioverter . defibrillator (ICD) which will shock her heart if it stops again. After . coming out of intensive care, the relieved teenager gave her dad a . medal inscribed with 'Dad of the year 2014 – for saving my life'. Now her family are pleading with others to avoid high-caffeine energy drinks. College . student Miss Dinsdale, who can't remember anything of the night or . following day, said: 'The doctors have said it was all to do with the . energy drinks. 'Alcohol slows your heart rate but the energy drinks speed it up. 'That's why I was able to come home and sleep ok, but when the alcohol totally left my system at 10am, my heart stopped. 'I'm . quite glad I don't really remember it all. But now I am looking at how . much caffeine is in energy drinks, I just can't believe they are on . sale.' Mr Dinsdale, added: . 'This could have happened to anyone. It wasn’t caused by alcohol, it was . the amount of caffeine in her body. It's shocking the amount of . caffeine in those drinks.' Medics . said that while most people can tolerate caffeine in moderation, . 'excessive consumption' can lead to seizures, strokes or sudden death. Consultant . emergency physician at Yeovil District Hospital, Dr David Maritz, said: . 'Given the potential for harm as seen from reviews and reports of . toxicity in medical literature, it suggests children and young adults, . especially those with predisposing medical conditions, are potentially . at risk from some serious adverse effects from excessive consumption of . energy drinks.' One in ten British teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week . High in sugar, cleverly marketed and sold in supermarkets and shops alongside regular soft drinks, it's easy to see why young people in their masses have taken to energy drinks. Last year, a major study found our children have one of the highest consumption rates in Europe. One in ten British teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week. Worryingly, younger children are following suit: one in four under-tens - 24 per cent - has had at least one energy drink in the past year, compared with the European average of 18 per cent. Now, experts are calling for them to be banned from sale to youngsters. In a paper last year, Dr Jack James, editor of the Journal of Caffeine Research, says caffeine should be regulated just like cigarettes and alcohol. 'Although caffeine has been widely considered to be benign, awareness is increasing that its consumption is associated with substantial harm, including fatalities and near-fatalities,' he wrote. 'How many caffeine-related fatalities and near-misses must there be before we regulate?' In January month, a government adviser compared energy drinks with drugs, and urged schools to ban them. Some schools have done so, with many teachers complaining the drinks affect behaviour and concentration. And a 2011 study in America reported on a number of cases where excessive caffeine consumption in energy drinks had been associated with effects such as 'seizures, mania, stroke and sudden death'. The researchers warned that high caffeine drinks were particularly risky for children with existing conditions such as heart arrhythmias, diabetes or mood and behavioural disorders, which may be undiagnosed.","Jayde Dinsdale, 18, was drinking shots on a two-for-one drinks promotion .

"The first crop circle of the year has appeared in a field near Blandford Forum in Dorset leaving locals stumped over who or what created it. Covering an enormous stretch of wheat field, the 400ft pattern, which is made up of geometric lines and circles, emerged overnight. While many believe crop circles are created by local pranksters, some think the mysterious shapes are evidence of aliens, including amateur pilot and crop circle enthusiast Matthew Williams, 43, who said: ‘Whoever, or whatever, created the shape must have been there all night - you have to really admire their handiwork.' Scroll down for video . Mysterious: The first crop circle of the year has appeared in a field near Blandford Forum in Dorset sparking interest in who or what has created it . Technical: Some believe the crop circle is the result of a skilled artist, while others believe the geometric points show the spot where a spaceship has landed . Separating the wheat from the chaff: July is the prime month for crop circles because it is when wheat is harvested. Wheat is the easiest crop to work with . Illegal: Farmers aren't a fan of crop circles because they destroy the crops. Matthew Williams was fined £100 by magistrates in 2000 after admitting causing damage . Some farmers mow the incredible formations out of their field as soon as they appear to deter recurrences . Mr . Williams, from Avebury, Wiltshire, added: ‘Last summer we didn't get . many circles, but this beauty certainly makes up for that. ‘The first circle of the season really does mark the start of great British summer. ‘I . know farmers hate them, but you really do have to appreciate the amount . of effort that went in to making a 400ft pattern in a field of crops.’ There is increasing rivalry between the circle makers to produce ever more complex, intricate patterns. However Mr Williams is not a believer of the paranormal and has previously admitted to creating crop circles himself. He is the only man in Britain convicted of making crop circles after admitting damaging a farmer’s crop in 2000 near Marlborough, Wiltshire. Mr Williams, who was fined £100 by magistrates, was prosecuted after one of his crop circles was published on the internet. He has since given up his hobby because he suffers from hayfever. A crackdown by farmers meant that only 15 crop circles appeared in Wiltshire last year, compared to 50 in 2012. Insiders claim farmers are fed up with crop circles and tourists looking to have an 'out of body experience' inside them. This crop circle, which appeared in a field in Alton Priors near Wiltshire in June 2004, was also created in a wheat field . A bee crop circle similarly appeared in wheat fields in Milk Hill, near Alton Barnes in Wiltshire in June 2004 . Some have taken the drastic step of mowing the formations out of their fields as soon as they appear. According to John Lundberg, who has also admitted to creating the designs, July is the best month for crop circles. He told the BBC: ‘The season runs from April, when the first crop is oil seed rape. In June it's barley and by mid-July it's wheat. That's the best crop to work in, that's when the most spectacular circles appear. Because each stem is upright, you can get pin sharp clarity.’ Like farmers, not everyone appreciates the efforts that Mr Lundberg goes to. He reported abuse from people who believe crop circles are in fact the work of aliens. Mr Lundberg, who is part of a group called Circlemakers, said: ‘My art collective - myself, Rod Dickinson and Will Russell - get thousands of abusive e-mails and phone calls. We've had attacks on our property, and one of my team had bricks thrown at him. But at least this is not America - people don't carry guns here. ‘I don't regard myself as a hoaxer - I'm not interested in rug-pulling anybody. Yet the assumption is that if I make a crop circle, it must be because I want to undermine the beliefs of people who think they are not man-made.’","Intricate design is the first one of the year and has emerged in a field near Blandford Forum in Dorset .
The number of crop circles appearing in Britain is declining: 2012 produced 50 while 2013 produced just 15 .
Some believe this is because of a recent crackdown by farmers as trespass and destruction of crops is illegal .
Sceptics believe crop circles are entirely man-made, while others believe they are the creation of aliens ."

"A model mother-of-two claims her millionaire husband offered to pay a hitman $80,000 to have her murdered in a fit of jealousy after she wanted to return to work and posed for these raunchy modelling photos. Monica, 32, gave up her catwalk career to marry the former waste disposal magnate turned vitamin tycoon Dino Guglielmelli in 2003. But after the births of their two daughters she wanted to return to work. She launched her own Skin by Monica Olsen beauty line with the help of Guglielmelli and it went national through Duane Reade and Walgreens. She began talks about developing a film from a comic strip based on Monica. 'Hit the roof': A source said the tipping point for Monica Olsen's husband Dino Guglielmelli was when she posed for these pictures. Her 'jealous' husband hated the thought of men ogling at her, claimed a source . Jealous: 'It . was a professional shoot in an LA  studio, there was a team of . assistants, make up artists and stylists. But Dino accused Monica and Kenneth of getting too close,' a source said . Monica tried to relaunch her acting and modeling career at the end . of 2010 but her husband objected from the get-go, according to the . source close to the investigation. And when he discovered she had also . done an underwear shoot with fashion photographer Kenneth Matthews he . 'hit the roof;' a source close the investigation claimed. Their relationship fell apart and they began a bitter custody battle over their two daughters. Some months later Monica discovered her husband had been taped trying to hire a friend to kill her. The burly 52-year-old is set to stand trial next month on attempted murder and solicitation to murder charges. 'He became insanely jealous. He . could not stand the idea that men were ogling his wife in raunchy magazines like Maxim,' the source said. 'The tipping point was a photo shoot she did with Kenneth Matthews in 2012. Dino saw the pictures and hit the roof. 'It . was a professional shoot in an LA  studio, there was a team of . assistants, make up artists and stylists. But Dino accused Monica and Kenneth of getting too close. 'Sure the photos are raunchy - they are underwear shots -- but that's what Monica's fans expect. Dino told her she wasn't doing anymore photo shoots. Period. Taped: A horrified friend of Guglielmelli (left) went to detectives after the bitter husband allegedly discussed 'specifics' about having his wife killed. He was said to be recorded saying: 'I'll be happy when it is all over' Model and mother: Olsen gave up her successful modelling career in Manhattan to move to LA when she fell in love with her husband at the age of 22 and they had two daughters together. But then their relationship soured . Movies: Monica was also looking forward to developing a movie from a comic that was based on her . 'He told her she needed to stay home . and care for their daughters. By now Monica was concerned for her own . safety. His anger was uncontrollable. 'But . she insisted she wanted her career back. And that's when things turned . really ugly. He banned her from having a life of her own. 'He stopped her doing anymore movie shoots, he killed a possible movie deal. 'That's . when Monica knew she needed to leave him. And Dino went crazy. He was a . control freak who needed to be win at everything. It was then he allegedly hired the hitman.' As his behavior became more bizarre, Montreal-born Monica asked him to leave their Canyon Country, Santa Clarita, ranch. She claims he responded by demanding custody of their daughters and calling cops to accuse her of attacking him. Monica spent a terrifying night in a jail cell, then filed for divorce. But in October major case detectives from Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department told her they’d arrested Guglielmelli for attempted murder. Guglielmelli allegedly offered ex Army veteran Richard Fuhrmann $80,000 to kill Monica. The would-be hitman went to the police, then secretly recorded a 90-minute lunch conversation. On the tapes, which were played during a pre-trial hearing at a San Fernando court, Guglielmelli is heard saying: 'I’ll be happy when it is all over.' After discussing 'specifics' on how to get rid of Monica, he then asks Furhmann: 'There’s no way for them to track it back to me?' And he is also heard on tape reassuring Furhmann: 'You’re going to get paid. Don’t worry about that – I’ve got you covered.' Businesswoman: Sources claimed that when her skin care products business scored success and went national through Duane Reade and Walgreens, he was upset because he wanted her 'pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen' rather than having a career . Terror: A source told MailOnline: 'He basically wrecked her life and if his alleged hitman-for-hire plan had worked she probably wouldn’t be here to tell the tale' Guglielmelli, an aspiring singer in a rock band called COR, has been in custody since October after being unable to raise $10 million bail. In November he granted his brother Gino power of attorney over his $50 million-a-year Creation’s Garden health and beauty business and filed for bankruptcy. Listing debts of just over $1.5 million, the company’s assets, including $8 million stock, was auctioned off in February. Monica, who claims her ex is still trying to sabotage her life from behind bars, is now fighting to regain her share of the business, which once employed 300 people. She hopes to launch a new skin care line and kick- start her once promising acting career. 'Their joint beauty business was incredibly successful. But now it is bankrupt and she fears he has syphoned money off-shore.  It was as though he couldn’t stand her success. He wanted to be the star of the show and hated the fact she was doing so well. 'He basically wrecked her life and if his alleged hitman-for-hire plan had worked she probably wouldn’t be here to tell the tale.' Claim and counter-claim: While Monica says she still lives in fear her husband's lawyer, from a noted Mafia family, said Guglielmelli was set up by the hitman . Monica, who starred opposite Rachel McAdams in the 2002 hit The Hot Chick, told Mail Online she was unable to talk because of the upcoming trial and her lawyer Ronald Lebow did not return calls for comment. Assistant district attorney Emily Cole said: 'I am sure the defense wants to call lots of witnesses to say what a nice guy he is but my case is very simple. It is a murder for hire case. The divorce will come into it a little because it plays into his motives. But I have no plans to call Brett Ratner at this stage.' Guglielmelli’s lawyer Tony Brooklier is a leading Mafia lawyer, whose father Dominic was the boss of the LA’s La Cosa Nostra. He has won acquittals for several mob-connected clients.  He insists Guglielmelli was set up by the alleged hitman.","Vitamin tycoon Dino Guglielmelli, 52, 'hit the roof' after wife Monica Olsen, 32, wanted to relaunch her modelling career.

"Power shift: The poll was commissioned after comments by Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont . The majority of Scots in favour of remaining part of the UK will be slashed by half if the economic revival leads to a major surge in David Cameron’s popularity, according to a new poll. The boost for Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond comes after a claim that he could use the ‘hated Tories’ to pull off a surprise victory in the independence referendum. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Scottish Labour Party leader Johann Lamont told Ed Miliband last week that if Scots think the Tories will win the 2015 Election and be in power for ‘between five and 15 years’, they are more likely to vote to quit the UK. A Survation poll in Scotland for The Mail on Sunday provides evidence to back up Ms Lamont’s argument. The majority of 20 per cent in favour of a ‘No’ to independence vote falls to 14 if voters believe Mr Cameron will defeat Mr Miliband. And the gap narrows to just nine if voters believe Labour will be out of power for longer. The result is a tonic for Mr Salmond, whose supporters have been dismayed by polls showing that as few as one in four Scots want to leave the UK. But the recent upturn in the UK economy, which cut Mr Miliband’s lead over Mr Cameron to one per cent in one survey, could change that. According to Survation, if Britain’s economic fortunes and Tory ratings continue to rise, it will have an effect on the referendum result in September. Verdict: The result of the poll on how Scots would change their vote for independence if the Tories win . Asked by Survation if they intended to vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to quitting the UK, 52 per of Scots said ‘No’, with 32 in favour of ‘Yes’ – broadly in line with recent trends. However, when asked how they would vote if they believed Mr Cameron would win in 2015, the anti-independence majority slips. A total of 49 said they would vote ‘No’ with 35 in favour of ‘Yes.’ And when asked how they would vote if they thought the Tories would be in power for up to 15 years, the ‘No’ vote goes down to 47, with the ‘Yes’ vote catching up on 38. The results reflect the deep unpopularity of the Conservatives in Scotland. They have only one MP in Westminster compared with 41 Labour MPs from Scottish seats. The figures are bound to be seized . upon by Mr Salmond to motivate supporters. The Mail on Sunday . commissioned the survey after learning of the comments by Ms Lamont at a . private meeting with Mr Miliband and his Shadow Cabinet in London last . week. Preparing to fly the nest: First Minister Alex Salmond (right) talked about whether Scotland would give up the pound or join the Euro when he met with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney (left) on Wednesday . She begged them to send more English Labour MPs to Scotland to tell the public they do not want Scotland to break away. There was a risk of a rise in support for the ‘Yes’ campaign if Scots believed the Tories would win the Election, she said. A Labour insider said: ‘Lamont made a very powerful argument. She said Miliband and co have got to get off their backsides and go to Scotland to join the “No” campaign and convince Scots they can beat Cameron in 2015.’ The results pose a ‘Catch 22’-style dilemma for Mr Cameron. If his economic recovery plan stays on course, it will increase his chances of staying in No 10 – but it could make it harder for him to convince Scots not to cut ties with the UK.","20 per cent majority saying 'no' reduces to 14 per cent if Tories win in 2015 .

"Only one in five children eats vegetables every day - instead preferring processed food such as sausages and fish fingers, a survey has revealed. Just 19 per cent of parents said their . child eats vegetables every and of those who don't, over half said their . child, 'simply won't eat them at all'. The worrying findings come after latest figures showed that a third of final-year primary school students are overweight or obese. Only one in five children eats vegetables every day - instead preferring processed food such as sausages and fish fingers, a survey has found . And last year it was revealed that children as young as 14 are having weight loss surgery, with 45 going under the knife in England since 2007. The new survey, commissioned by Vouchercloud, also found that the average child in the UK eats just five different meals a week - including sausages, chips and fish fingers. The study polled 1,912 parents with children aged 10 or under and revealed children only eat five different types of meal a week. More than 80 per cent of parents also admitted their child was 'too fussy' - but nearly 40 per cent said they didn't feel vegetables were necessary with every meal. 1) Spaghetti bolognese: 43% . 2) Sausage and chips: 40% . 3) Roast dinner: 37% . 4) Sausage and mash: 35% . 5) Fish fingers and chips: 35% . Just over 61 per cent of parents conceded their child's diet was limited, but only 23 per cent had tried to broaden their child's eating preferences. Commenting on the latest research, Matthew Wood of Vouchercloud.com, said: 'It was surprising to see just how few meals the average child eats, but seeing that so few parents have attempted to broaden their child's eating habits explains a lot.' Last month a study found that an aversion to eating greens is in the genes - rather than a child simply being a picky eater for no reason. DNA also largely governs our taste for fruit, the University College London researchers found. However, they say parents aren't completely off the hook because a child's appetite for chocolate, crisps, biscuits and chips is mainly fed by what happens at home. The researchers asked the parents of more than 1,300 pairs of twins how much their children liked 84 different foods. Previous research has found that children who introduced to vegetables with a sauce - such as ketchup or cheese - are more likely to eat them plain later on . Salad was particularly disliked, followed by sprouts and mushrooms. And only four vegetables were actually liked – sweet corn, peas, tomatoes and carrots.  However, the tomatoes had to be tinned and the carrots cooked to pass muster. But help may be at hand. Another study last month found that adding condiments such as ketchup and cheese sauce to vegetables can help develop a child's taste for greens later in life. Arizona Sate University researchers say children introduced to Brussels sprouts with cream cheese were more likely to eat them and say they liked them - even when they were later served plain.","Survey found that 10 per cent of children also totally refuse to eat veg .

"The stray dog that refused to leave a group of Swedish adventurers on an extreme sports race through the Amazon rain forest continues to recover in quarantine, after being adopted by the the team's captain. Arthur the dog made national headlines last November for tagging along with Mikael Lindnord and the rest of Team Peak Performance as the group of men hiked,  climbed and kayaked hundreds of miles through the Ecuadorian wild. Earlier this month, the team updated Arthur's fans on Facebook after a trip to visit the recovering dog at a quarantine facility in their native Sweden. Scroll down for video . Lifelong friends: Mikael Lindnord (right) decided to adopt stray dog Arthur last November, when the mutt refused to leave his team during a grueling extreme sports race through the Amazonian wilderness. Pictured above with Arthur in Sweden, where the dog continues to recover in quarantine . Good to see you! Arthur jumps on the lap of Team Peak Performance'sStaffan Björklund during a visit to quarantine on February 5 . The team wrote that Arthur was originally scheduled to leave quarantine on February 5 to undergo surgery, but the request was denied at the last minute because he still wasn't in good enough health for the Swedish Board of Agriculture. Instead, Lindnord and some of Arthur's other friends visited him in quarantine where he has experienced a 'huge progress in health'. 'We met a very happy dog and it didn’t take a second before he recognize us and jumped in to my knee, we where so happy to see him today [sic],' the post reads. According to the post, the dirt on Arthur's skin is gone, his ears are much better, his claws are growing again and the last wound on his back is almost completely healed. His teeth still need improvement however. The team wrote that they respect the Agriculture Board's decision to keep Arthur in quarantine for the time being. They also went on to praise the quarantine's staff for doing an 'amazing job' with their new best friend. The fifth member: Team Peak Performance met Arthur during the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship. He followed the group of four during the grueling race . All terrains: Despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of Arthur, primarily for his own safety, he refused to go. It meant when he got stuck in the knee-deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted, they stopped to take a break . Support: At one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle, so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food . Arthur first met Lindnord in November, as his team were sitting down for a meal that would fuel them through a dangerous 20-mile trek through the Ecuadorian rainforest. As he opened his can of meat, a tired Lindnord noticed Arthur, then a scruffy, miserable stray dog,  staring at him out of the corner of his eye. Feeling sorry for him, he fed Arthur a meatball and thought nothing of it, but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them - and he didn't stop. As the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship, Arthur befriended them and was eventually given his new name. Every grueling task the team face, Arthur would do the same. He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers, dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee-deep mud during treks. Determined: Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. But Arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by Lindord . Resting: When the team slept Arthur would also curl up and take a nap alongside them . Encounter:  Lindnord (right) first noticed the scruffy dog when he was sitting down to eat canned meatballs. He fed Arthur one thinking nothing on it, but ended up creating a bond with the dog . Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave. This meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out. After six days the team finished the race, and the dog had suffered. They therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out. During that time Lindnord thought to himself that after their experience, they could not leave Arthur, so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden. He applied to the Jordbruksverket (the Swedish Board of Agriculture) and was made to wait to see if his application was successful. After a tense few days, the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home. Adventure Racing is a form of extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days. Attention: The team let passengers stroke Arthur as he wondered around the airport terminal before their flight back to Sweden where he is still being kept in quarantine . The world championships held in Ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the Andes, the Pacific and the Amazon rainforest. Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. They tried to set off without him, but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling. Lindord, heartbroken by the site of Arthur struggling in the water, picked him up, put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey. The gesture prompted a standing ovation and cheers from spectators watching from the banks. The ordeal to get him back to Sweden was documented on the team's Facebook page. In one post Lindord wrote: 'I almost cried in front of the computer, when receiving the decision from Jordbruksverket (Board of Agriculture) in Sweden!' 'The team is overwhelmed and happy knowing that Jordbruksverket has approved Mikaels application to bring Arthur to Sweden. A big important piece in the work to get Arhur on the plane, is done. So far so good. But, There are [sic] still one paper to go. The team are now working hard for the very last piece in this puzzel [sic]. Lindord ended by saying: 'I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship. Instead, I got a new friend.'","Mikael Lindnord adopted Arthur the dog after the mutt refused to leave his extreme sports team on a 430-mile journey through the Amazon .

"Dog owners could be arrested and subjected to 74 lashes if they are caught taking their pet for a walk or keeping one in their home under a proposed Iranian law. A bill presented by 32 members of the Iranian Parliament  claimed that owning a dog as a pet harms the country's Islamic culture because of their 'uncleanliness'. Violators could be arrested if they are caught accompanying their pet in public and forced to pay a fine of up to 100 million rials, around £2,243, or receive 74 lashes. Dog-owners such as Shohreh (pictured) fear losing their beloved pets in the latest clampdown . Unwelcome pets could also be confiscated and transferred to a zoo or desert, according to the bill. An excerpt of the bill released by France-based opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran, said: 'Anyone who takes a pet like a monkey or a dog in public and damages the Islamic culture or the health and tranquility of the people - particularly children and women, or attempts to buy or sell them, or keep them at their house, and not to act on the warnings issued by State Security Forces (police), would be fined between 10 to 100 million rials or would receive 74 lashes, plus the pet would be confiscated.' The law will  exempt police officers, farm owners, sheep herders and fishermen. Dog ownership has been frowned upon over the past years from authorities who criminalise its owners and deem it as an imitation of Western culture. Animal supporters regard the rule as a crackdown on youth and an attempt to suppress freedoms in the conservative country. Unwelcome pets could also be confiscated and transferred to a zoo or desert, according to the bill . The Iranian regime has already banned drivers travelling with pets in their cars. In 2011, authorities threatened to criminalise dog ownership and said the growing popularity of keeping the pets 'poses a cultural problem, blind imitation of the vulgar Western culture'. In June 2010 Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirzi warned that dog ownership would lead to family corruption and damage societal values. 'Many people in the West love their dogs more than their wives and children,' he said. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance then banned all media from publishing adverts about pets, according to AFP.

On seeing Mr Cameron in Jaffna, a group of 200 women brandishing posters of their loved ones who have disappeared broke through a security cordon. Three women reached the car and tried to hand over information about the missing before being knocked to the ground by police. Mr Cameron then travelled to Kannaki refugee camp to meet those whose loved ones are believed to have been killed by the regime at the end of Sri Lanka’s civil war. Families have lived there for 23 years. Human rights groups say that up to 40,000 civilians were slaughtered in the final offensive against the Tamil Tigers in 2009.

Mobbed: On a walk Cameron talks to villagers of internally displaced people's camp at Chunnakam village, in Jaffana . Camp spokesman Sutharshan Uthayaswriyan, said they had high hopes that Mr Cameron’s visit will improve the plight of the Tamils. ‘We believe in David Cameron,’ he said, adding: ‘He is a god coming down to this area. ‘We believe he can make a difference. He is a god and he is sent by God to us.’ Last night Mr Cameron confronted Mr Rajapaksa and his brother, defence minister Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, about claims of war crimes, an exchange the PM described as ‘a very lively meeting’. Battle: Cameron went to the northern areas that saw the worst of the war between soldiers and ethnic Tamils rebels fighting for a homeland . Powerful: The Prime Minister said he had been confronted by 'incredibly powerful' images during his visit to the north . Voices were raised as Mr Cameron told the president his government should seek a reconciliation deal with the Tamil minority such as that thrashed out in Northern Ireland. Mr Rajapaksa hit back, accusing Mr Cameron of trying to drum up votes with the 150,000 Tamils living in London. One Cameron aide described it as the ‘liveliest bilateral I have ever seen’ – diplomatic code for a blazing row. Mr Cameron ‘pressed his points very directly and robustly’, a source said.

Tharumangan Tinesh, a 36-year-old reporter, said: ‘Our families are a bit scared to send us to work, but we are working for the truth.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘I think coming here, listening to these people, hearing these arguments, helps to draw attention to their plight. I think the spotlight has been shone on Sri Lanka and people can see the good and the bad.’ Mr Cameron will now lobby world leaders to bring pressure on Mr Rajapaksa to hold a new inquiry into alleged war crimes.

"Leg of lamb: Tasty, and it could be good for your face . Forget expensive face creams and Botox. If you want younger-looking skin, try rustling up a soup from the leftovers of your Sunday roast. Broth made from the bones of a beef joint or leg of lamb is being hailed as an anti-ageing treatment by experts,  with claims it can firm the face. Julia March, a beauty therapist to Hollywood celebrities, recommends it to clients complaining of sagging skin or redness. She said: ‘My clients see less inflammation, more glow and more toned skin when they drink it. It repairs, strengthens, rejuvenates and heals.’ She recommends drinking up to three cups of broth a day to improve the complexion. The broth is made by simmering bones in water with a dash of vinegar, which is said to help draw out minerals, for several hours. Vegetables and herbs can be added to improve the taste. Advocates claim it can improve the complexion because of its high levels of natural collagen, the protein that gives skin its strength and flexibility. This is coupled with hyaluronic acid, a molecule found in bone cartilage which draws water and essential minerals to cells. Jaclyn Flavell, author of ebook Bone Broth: A Recipe For Health, said: ‘It stands that a sufficient amount of healthy collagen under the skin in the subcutaneous fat will keep skin strong and smooth, resulting in less wrinkles and cellulite. ‘Hyaluronic acid, a water-loving molecule, most likely contributes to healthy-looking skin by retaining moisture. ‘Consuming bone broth which is rich in collagen and cartilage if prepared properly, is an easy and inexpensive way to maintain strong, smooth and supple skin.’ Nutritionist Ian Marber, founder of The Food Doctor brand, said: ‘It can help plump up the skin. It can also help digestion and as it’s rich in magnesium, can help combat stress and relax muscles too. It’s good stuff.’ Unorthodox: A Hollywood beauty therapist has started recommending bone broth to clients (file photo) Mr Marber recommends making bone broth using grass-fed beef for the greatest benefit, and advises breaking up the bones to expose the marrow before heating. However, Ayela Sprio, a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, said no scientific trials have been carried out to prove the benefits of bone broth – and advised against drinking too much. She said: ‘A recent paper suggested some concern in increasing bone broth consumption considerably. ‘The authors reported there may be a high lead concentration in such broths as bones are known to hold on to lead. ‘The majority of national and international skin associations would recommend a balanced healthy diet to ensure all the nutrients important for skin health are consumed.’","Experts are hailing soup of beef or lamb leftovers as an anti-ageing therapy .

"They are familiar sights around Paris and Rome but love-locks, inscribed by couples and attached to bridges, are becoming increasingly popular in New York with hundreds taking over Brooklyn Bridge. The romantic mementos are increasingly appearing on the 1883 suspension bridge - particularly since Valentine's Day on Tuesday - as couples rush to make a public pledge to one another while taking in the Manhattan skyline. They are basic, every-day padlocks inscribed or doodled on with dates and initials of the couple, who are then supposed to throw their key in the water as a public statement of their 'everlasting love'. A 'love-lock' hangs on Brooklyn Bridge. Thousands have appeared on the landmark in recent years . Growing popularity: Individual locks are in place all over Brooklyn Bridge, left, but the practice is yet to reach the heights of that seen on landmarks in Italy and Paris, right . The practice is popular in Europe and has had a boost in recent years from Federico Moccia's novel Ho Voglia di Te, which featured a couple doing it in Florence. It seems it started as a spontaneous practice stumbled upon and copied by romantic couples the world over without any idea who did it first. But it is now so popular, in some places, tourist stalls are cashing-in selling expensive locks to lovers so they can still make a pledge even if they are ill-prepared. Also despite it being a seemingly innocent activity, many cities say they have had to stamp it out to protect old structures and stop it multiplying without limits, something New York may have to consider in the future. In Florence, Italy, thousands of locks were removed from the world famous Ponte Vecchio as authorities claimed it was damaging the bridge. The same was done in Dublin and to try to reduce the practice in Rome a website was established so that couples could just leave a lock 'virtually'. Romance in France: Hundreds of locks are attached to landmarks in Paris as well as cities throughout Italy . The locks are also found in Cologne, Germany, pictured, across the Hohenzollernbruecke Bridge . Engraved: In Brooklyn, left, some locks are engraved while others are daubed in pen, right . Locked: In Europe all sorts of landmarks are targeted, including this statue on the Alexandre III bridge in Paris . In fact Italy's capital is one of the most affected cities and in 2007 a lamppost on the Ponte Milvio reportedly collapsed due to the weight of the locks attached to it. In New York, the practice is officially against city rules but Department for Transportation officials appear to turn a blind eye. They have previously warned that 'on occasion' they will remove the locks 'as necessary' following their inspections, according to the New York Daily News. Other cities believe the romantic practice attracts tourists and have even taken steps to promote it. In Liverpool in the UK, a sign on the Albert Docks reads: 'This is a special place for lovers! Interlock your padlocks on the railings and throw away the key into the Mersey. You will never lose your true love!' Among the recent wave of locks which have appeared on Brooklyn Bridge the quality of the endeavor varies massively. Some couples simply pen their names on novelty locks while others take on a more professional approach with fully engraved or painted designs. Every odd bit of metal which can be found on the bridge appears to have been targeted including metal parts of the structure, benches, and rusting old hooks in the stonework.","Popular European practice where a couple inscribe a date and their initials onto a lock and attach it to a bridge is becoming increasingly common in America .
The couple throw the key into the water as a 'sign of their everlasting love'
The origin of the practice is unknown but has been given a boost after appearing in romantic fiction in recent years .
In parts of Rome, Italy, it has been outlawed after a large number of locks caused a lamp-post to partially collapse in 2007 ."

'Without her courage and quick thinking, we might be mourning the deaths of 20, yes, I said 20, people today, including myself and nearly all of our children and grandchildren,’ Mr Lyon said.

'In the second half, the goal was unlucky. After then we showed the team spirit is unbelievable. We changed the shape, that was the solution I think. We scored fantastic goals, little bit lucky also.

"Detectives investigating the acid attack on Victoria's Secret shop assistant Naomi Oni have arrested two of her friends, it emerged today. It came after the probe had started to focus on whether Miss Oni lied about the incident – triggering angry denials from the 21-year-old. But yesterday police said they had arrested a separate 21-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man who are known to the victim. Miss Oni was targeted by a woman wearing an Islamic veil as she returned home from her job at the lingerie store. Scroll down for video . 'Somehow I knew it was acid': Naomi Oni describes the horrific attack that left her with chemical burns . Emotional: Naomi Oni, 20, pictured with This Morning host Phillip Schofield earlier this month. A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of GBH . Shocking: Naomi Oni was returning from a shift at Victoria's Secret in Stratford, when the attack happened . She spent almost a month in a specialist burns unit while doctors fought to save her sight and carried out skin grafts to repair the scarring to her face inflicted in the early hours of December 30 last year. The acid had burned her face, arm, hand and leg and left her temporarily blinded. Reports over the weekend suggested detectives investigating the crime believed Miss Oni may have been somehow responsible for her own injuries. Police also seized her laptop and claims emerged that she had looked at websites detailing acid attacks before the incident. Sheila Maclean, who is a friend of Miss Oni,  said her family was considering making an official complaint to police. Miss Oni said: ‘I’ve only just come out of hospital after having surgery to my eye. To see this story saying that I’d done it made me so angry and really hurts. ‘There’s no way I would have done this to myself. I want the person who did this to be caught.’ Yesterday a Scotland Yard spokesman stressed Miss Oni had not been arrested. He added: . ‘On Friday, 22 February, a 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of being involved in causing grievous bodily harm. ‘On Sunday, 24 February, a 28-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of being involved in causing grievous bodily. Both have been bailed to return, pending further inquiries.’ Campaigner: Miss Oni is understood to have researched high profile acid attack victim Katie Piper before she was attacked herself . Miss Oni has told of how she became . aware of someone behind her as she walked home after getting off a bus . in Dagenham, Essex, shortly after midnight. She was sprayed in the face . with burning liquid while she was speaking on her mobile phone to her . boyfriend Ato Owede, who is a 24-year-old law student. She said: ‘I felt a presence behind me a few minutes away from home so I turned around, not really expecting to see anybody. ‘But I saw a person wearing a niqab, a little taller than me. They were just staring coldly at me. I was startled so I turned away. Suddenly, from nowhere, I felt a splash on my right side and I just ran. ‘Before I even realised, it was burning, I somehow knew it was acid.’ Miss Oni was too afraid to  return to her home after she was released from hospital and is staying with relatives. The attack has left Miss Oni, who works at the Westfield Shopping Centre, in Stratford, East London, with psychological as well as physical scars, a friend said. ‘I had seen a picture of her face but when I saw her in the flesh she looked a lot worse,’ he added. ‘She didn’t speak to me about the attack. I’ve noticed a bit of a change in her, she is more aware now, she is cautious about who she talks to.

"Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney 'cheated' to win a penalty at Preston, insists Stan Collymore. The forward went over after being challenged by North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann, before picking himself up to convert the resulting spot-kick that put United 3-1 up on Monday. But debate surrounded about whether Rooney had dived to win a penalty, with former England striker Gary Lineker tweeting: 'A dive? Yes. A reckless challenge? Yes. An interesting one.' Wayne Rooney touched the ball past North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckman during the FA Cup clash . Rooney went down a moment after and several of the Preston players were unhappy with his actions . Rooney lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by the referee late on at Deepdale . But Collymore was in no doubt that Rooney was guilty of diving: 'Rooney shouldn't be diving due to his position as captain of club and country,' said on talkSport. 'He toe-pokes the ball past the goalkeeper, who he knows is coming out quickly, and he dives,' said Collymore. 'That’s cheating, we’ve had this debate a million times.' He added: 'When you wear that respect campaign armband, you owe it to the fans and the game not to do that. 'I’m bitterly disappointed, he is the England captain and Manchester United captain and he’s better than that.' Rooney scored from the spot-kick to put Manchester United 3-1 up on the night . Collymore's view that Rooney was echoed by former Preston player Kevin Kilbane, who said: 'There's no contact on Wayne Rooney. It's a dive.' However, Preston manager Simon Grayson refused to criticise Rooney, despite believing Stuckmann had not touched the United captain. ‘Wayne Rooney has not been touched by the goalkeeper. Yes he has had to jump out of the way but he has not been touched. I’m not saying it wasn’t a penalty, I’m saying there was no contact. You can interpret that how you want,' said Grayson. ‘It wasn’t a dive. He has gone to get out of the way and take evasive action. I’ m not complaining.' Former footballer Stan Collymore believes Rooney shouldn't be diving because of his position in the game . Rooney was defended by former United team-mate Phil Neville and England manager Roy Hodgson. Neville said: 'Wayne Rooney had to get out the way. For me it's a reckless challenge.' Hodgson said: 'I don't think it is a dive, he's taking evasive action.'","Wayne Rooney 'cheated' against Preston, believes Stan Collymore .

"Singer Charlotte Church has attacked fellow pop stars Rihanna and Miley Cyrus for acting as ‘submissive sex objects’ in their videos. The 27-year-old – dubbed the ‘Voice of an Angel’ when she first shot to fame aged 11 – admitted she now regrets wearing revealing outfits as a teenage star. And she called for BBC radio chiefs to put a ‘decency barrier’ on what they play on their stations and avoid promoting tracks that are accompanied by offensive online pop videos. Scroll down for video . Confession: Singer Charlotte Church has admitted she now regrets wearing fishnet tights and a corset, left, as a teenage star in the video to her single Call My Name . Miss Church was speaking a week after Miss Cyrus’ highly sexualised appearances were criticised by fellow artists Sinead O’Connor and Annie Lennox. Giving the annual John Peel lecture at the Radio Academy Radio Festival in Manchester, the mother-of-two said she worried explicit music videos are aimed at increasingly younger viewers. In a thinly veiled attack on Miss Cyrus – who first found fame as Hannah Montana on Disney – she said: ‘The women generally filling these roles are very young, often previous child stars or Disney tweens who are simply interested in getting along in an industry glamourised to be the most desirable career for young women. Pressure: Miss Church has revealed she was pressured into wearing revealing outfits by middle aged men . 'You look great': The men would spin lines such as 'You've got a great body' and 'It'll look classy', said the star . ‘They are encouraged to present themselves as hypersexualised, unrealistic, cartoonish, as objects. Reducing female sexuality to a prize that can be won.’ Miss Church reserved her most stinging attacks for Rihanna, whose recent YouTube video Pour It Up provoked outrage when she was seen writing on a chair in a jewel-encrusted bikini. She said: ‘[It] may have over 40 million hits on YouTube but you only have to look at the online response to see it is only a matter of time before the public turn on an artist for pushing it too far. 'But the single, like all of Rihanna’s other provocative hits, will make her male writers and producers and record label guys a ton of money. There is no easier way to sell something than to get some chick to get her t*** out, right?’ Action: Miss Church has called for BBC radio chiefs to put a 'decency barrier' on what they play on their stations and avoid promoting tracks that are accompanied by offensive online pop videos . But Miss Church admitted her own past was not blemish-free, and said she now regrets appearing in fishnet tights and a corset in the video to her single Call My Name as a 19-year-old. She said: ‘When I was 19 or 20 I found myself in this position, being pressured into wearing more and more revealing outfits. 'And the lines I was spun again and again, generally by middle aged men, were ""You look great, you’ve got a great body, why not show it off?"" or ""Don’t worry, it’ll look classy, it’ll look artistic"". 'I felt deeply uncomfortable about the whole thing but I was often reminded by record executives just whose money was being spent. ‘The consequence of this betrayal of me is that I am being constantly abused on social media, being called slut and a whore and a catalogue of other indignities. Now I find it difficult to promote my music in the places where it would be best suited, because of my history.’ Miss Church named a host of other female stars in her lecture, criticising Jennifer Lopez raunchy performance on Britain’s Got Talent earlier this year and blaming Madonna for ‘putting her sexuality at the heart of her image and her performance.’ Controversial: Miss Church has condemned fellow pop stars Miley Cyrus, left, and Rihanna, right, for acting as 'submissive sex objects' She called for websites such as YouTube to exercise greater control over what music videos can be viewed by children, saying: ‘It is interesting to note that anyone of any age has been able to watch Christina Aguilera’s simulated masturbation in her “Dirrty” video on YouTube since the website began, and yet you must sign in to the site to prove your age if you wanted to watch Bjork’s stunning video for “Pagan Poetry”.’ The singer also called for radio programmers to take a musician’s pop videos into account when deciding to give them airtime. She said: ‘BBC radio is notorious for misreading sexual metaphor and innuendo as innocent, most famously with Lou Reed’s Walk On The Wild Side, but more recently there doesn’t seem to be a decency barrier at all. ‘If there are no sanctions put on music that is written so zealously about genitalia or uses soft porn in its promotion online what is to stop artists from making their videos and live performances more sexy to drive up online views and subsequently more radio play.’ At the height of her fame, Miss Church sang for the Queen and Pope John Paul II and her 2005 pop album spawned four hits. However, in recent years she has moved away from the pop world and seen her musical fortunes wane. After taking a five-year break from writing, she released Back To Scratch in 2010. The album flop in the charts and sold just 16,000 copies in its first month.","The 27-year-old has attacked fellow pop stars Rihanna and Miley Cyrus for acting as 'submissive sex objects'

"Marouane Fellaini was left bloodied and bruised on Monday night, but the Manchester United midfielder had the last laugh as he helped his team to FA Cup victory against Preston North End. The 27-year-old is no stranger to the risks of a stray elbow, but he was on the end of a hard challenge from Preston's Bailey Wright, which left him needing treatment from the United medical staff at the side of the pitch. Undeterred, Fellaini went on to score United's second goal in a 3-1 win, after Ander Herrera had initially cancelled out Scott Laird's opener.

As the pair jumped to be first to a long ball, Wright's right elbow collided with Fellaini's eye, leaving the Manchester United midfielder in need of some help from the United physio. It is not the first time Fellaini has been involved in a controversial incident of this nature, having twice escaped serious punishment for his own apparent elbows on opposition players. While on international duty in November, the Belgian went unpunished for a challenge on Wales' Joe Allen, while last season he was only given a yellow card for an elbow on Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta.

"Mark Wright may have claimed that his fiancée doesn't diet and loves to eat Magnum ice-creams in bed - but judging by Michelle Keegan super-svelte appearance in her new fashion campaign, we're not quite sure we believe him. The soap star turned fashion designer has unveiled her second collection for Lipsy and she looks incredible - as always - in the campaign imagery. After the success of her first range for the high street chain, Michelle couldn't wait to get started on her next line. Scroll down for video . Red hot! Michelle Keegan has unveiled her second collection for high-street chain Lipsy and says she's taken inspiration from the season's hottest colours and trends to create a 20-piece range of party wear (dress, £65) 'This collection is a bit more wintry,' she told MailOnline. 'There's lots of lovely coats, fur jackets and sexy LBDs, which will be perfect for your Christmas parties.' When Michelle's debut range for Lipsy went  on sale in early July, the hashtag #lipsylovemichelle became the number one trending topic on Twitter in the UK and remained in the top ten until the end of the day. So how does it feel? 'The response has been incredible and I am so happy that everyone loves it as much as I do,' she said. 'It's the weirdest feeling in the world seeing other people wearing my designs. A girl walked passed me wearing one of my dresses and I said ""Hi"" to her because I thought I knew her!' Perfect for date night: Michelle cites this dress as one of her favourite designs in her new range and says she recently wore it out for dinner with her fiancée Mark Wright because it was so flattering (dress, £65) Budding designer: Michelle says she has learnt to go with her intuition a lot more the second time around and has only included pieces she would love to wear herself like this £65 blue dress, which she says is really 'different' In the nude: The 27-year-old actress says this range isn't as 'daring' as her first collection but has still been designed with confident, fun-loving girls in mind (dress, £60) Lady in red: The star created mood boards when working on her range and noted that red was the hottest colour of the season so included lots of vibrant and bold red jumpsuits and dresses (jumpsuit, £70) The 20-piece piece range, which lands online today at Lipsy.co.uk, as well as at ASOS.com, Very.co.uk, and in House of Fraser, Debenhams and Bank, aims to reflect the season’s hottest shapes, fabrics and styles that incorporate both the AW14 catwalk trends and Michelle’s coveted wardrobe. Speaking about her design experience, she said: 'I learnt a lot from my first time around and this time, I have gone with my instinct a lot more. I've made sure that every piece is something that I love and that I would wear myself. 'I was inspired by the catwalk but also the things I love to wear. A lot of the pieces are perfect for creating the layered look and there's lots of blazers that can be teamed with shorts, which you'll often find me wearing. 'I love the cami tops and I will be pairing them with a statement necklace,' she added. It's time to party! Michelle says that her latest drop is perfect for Christmas party season and reflects her 'classic' signature style (jumpsuit, £75) Casual and cool: As well as party dresses, Michelle has included some cool kimonos, leather trousers and classic white and black camisoles (kimono, £45) Michelle says that this range isn't 'as daring' as her first offering and explains that she's included some red pieces because it's the hottest colour of the season. Describing the typical 'Lipsy girl', Michelle says they're 'confident, fun-loving, girls who like to have a good time.' Describing her own personal style, Michelle said: 'My style is quite classic. I like block colours, I don't like a lot of fuss, I'm feminine and I really like the tailored look.' After setting sight on these images, it's perhaps unsurprising that the 27-year-old has topped the best celebrity body poll for the second time running.

Despite her enviable figure, you won't find Michelle Keegan breaking a sweat in the gym or starving herself on a juice diet. Speaking about her summer health regime, the former Coronation Street star told MailOnline: 'I haven't had any time for exercise, I'm gutted. I feel so much better when I do work out. 'I don't believe in crash diets or detoxes, I can't live like that. If I have a bad day then I'll have a good day the next.' How will you wear yours?

"The new governor of the Bank of England will be given a housing allowance of £250,000 a year, pushing his total annual earnings towards £1million. Canadian Mark Carney, who takes over from Sir Mervyn King on July 1, will get the extra cash on top of pay and perks worth £624,000. It takes his total annual package before tax to £874,000 – six times more than the £142,500 Prime Minister David Cameron is paid and 33 times the national average of £26,000 a year. Extra income: Canadian Mark Carney will receive £250,000 on top of his £480,000 salary for accommodation when he becomes Governor of the Bank of England . The one-off cost of moving Mr Carney and his family to Britain has yet to be finalised and will also be covered by the taxpayer. The housing allowance – agreed in . secret before Mr Carney was appointed last month but only made public . yesterday – will contribute towards a five-bedroom home for his wife and . four young daughters in central London. The deal was a crucial part of the . effort to tempt the 47-year-old to leave his job as governor of the Bank . of Canada and move his family to Britain. Mr Carney, hailed as ‘the outstanding . central banker of his generation’ by George Osborne, currently lives in a . spacious family home near the Bank of Canada headquarters in Ottawa. But the housing deal – worth . £1.25million over his five years as governor and enough to cover rent of . £2,500 a week after tax – will alarm MPs when many households are . struggling to make ends meet. The Canadian – the first foreigner to run . the Bank of England since it was set up in 1694 – insisted on serving . for just five years instead of eight and will earn far more than Sir . Mervyn’s £305,000 a year. Outgoing: Sir Mervyn King, who will stand down as Governor in June next year, is on a considerably lower salary than Mr Carney . It is also thought that Mr  Carney has . political ambitions and even thought about running for Prime Minister . in his homeland before accepting the Bank of England job. The Canadian now faces a showdown with . MPs on the Treasury Select Committee in February in what will be his . first public outing in Britain since his appointment. ‘Colleagues will want to ask about . every aspect of his appointment including, no doubt, remuneration,’ said . Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the powerful committee of MPs. Adam Posen, a former member of the . monetary policy committee at the Bank of England, has warned that Mr . Carney’s generous pay and perks means he could be seen as a ‘globe- . trotting corporate free agent’. Mark Carney has been appointed as the next governor of the Bank of  England in Threadneedle Street, London . The package was signed off yesterday . by the non-executive directors at the Bank of England – a group which . includes chairman Sir David Lees, Sir Roger Carr, chairman of British . Gas owner Centrica, and Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison. Mr Carney will get a basic salary of . £480,000, a cash allowance in lieu of pension of £144,000, and the . £250,000 a year housing allowance – a total of £874,000. John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury . Select Committee, said: ‘I think even by MPs’ standards it is a . remarkable amount of money to live on in London. ‘It is just comical that level of money.’ Mr Carney, who faces a UK tax bill of around £400,000 a year, has a British wife and intends to apply for British citizenship. The pay of fellow Canadian Moya . Greene, who runs Royal Mail and last year earned a total package worth . £1.1million, has also caused outrage. Although she gets perks such as two return flights to Canada each year, she does not get a housing allowance. After tax, Mark Carney will have a monthly housing allowance of £11,500 for his wife and four daughters. Here are some of the London properties he could rent: . Mr Carney could set up home in this beautiful seven-bedroom, regency period house and still have £2,000 each month to spare. The Grade II listed townhouse, which costs £9,500 a month, is located in leafy Blackheath, south east London, and even has its own swimming pool. Affordable: This seven bedroom home in Blackheath is well within his budget . For just slightly over budget (£11,917pcm), the Carneys could live in the heart of London in this magnificent five bedroom house just a stone’s throw from Parliament Square, Buckingham Palace and St. James’ Park. Luxurious: A bit over budget, but it's walking distance to Parliament . If the Carney family fancy rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous, they could rent this five-bed apartment in trendy St John’s Wood - a popular haunt of celebrities including Sir Paul McCartney and Kate Moss. Furthermore, the property, which costs £10,834-a-month, is located on Abbey Road, close to the studios and zebra crossing made famous by the Beatles. Plush: This pad is on Abbey Road, of Beatles album cover fame . For £8,667-a-month, Mr Carney could opt for this five-bed family home, located close to picturesque Hampstead Heath, one of the most sought-after areas of London. Location: This five bedroom house is in sought-after Beaumont Gardens in Hampstead . If Mr Carney wants to live within walking distance of the Bank of England, then he could chose this £10,000-a-month 18th century townhouse, which comes complete with a retractable glass room and contemporary internal ‘living wall’ of plants. Desirable: Mr Carney might like this 18th century townhouse in Queen Anne's Gate .","Mr Carney, 47, will replace Sir Mervyn King as the Governor in July .

"It was almost seven o'clock in the evening by the time Jose Mourinho arrived at Parc de Princes, but his reputation, as usual, had preceded him by several hours. 'I know Jose Mourinho and he will raise the temperature of this match,' said Laurent Blanc, earlier in the day, an unexpected reply to a question about the temperament of Marco Verratti, the 22-year-old Italian midfielder. 'Even when it is hot out there on the turf, they must stay calm and cold. We can't afford any more yellow cards.' Jose Mourinho said it is hard for English teams to compete in the Champions League and compete at home . Mourinho (right) leads his Chelsea players in training before the game against Paris Saint-Germain . Striker Diego Costa (left) is set to return to the Chelsea team for the first leg in France against PSG . Mourinho fears that Costa (centre) is lacking in match sharpness because of his recent suspension . Chelsea knocked PSG out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage of the competition last year . Blanc is keen to bill his team as outsiders, especially since his injury concerns deepened against Caen on Saturday, as Chelsea enjoyed the weekend without a game, as they were out of the FA Cup. The Paris Saint-Germain manager had even gone as far as to hint they were happy to have lost against Bradford. He was in classic Mourinho territory, bemoaning weariness and how the other lot had it much easier, but the Chelsea boss switched his angle and claimed Diego Costa would be lacking match sharpness. It was hard to find the mirrors in the smoke. Mourinho declined to answer Blanc directly but teased about some of his pet subjects. Such as, how it is easier to plan a European campaign if your domestic competition is a procession. 'The last two English teams to win the Champions League, Chelsea and Liverpool finished fifth, 25 points behind the champions,' said Mourinho, although Chelsea actually finished sixth. 'They stopped playing for the title because a team that is playing in this country to win every game, to try to be champions, has a completely different profile. 'In Germany, for Bayern it's a promenade. In Spain they are waiting for Real Madrid against Barcelona and Barca against Real to decide which one is the champion. Atletico was an exception. In France, Paris knows they are going to be champions even losing or drawing a few matches. 'The last person to speak to about accumulation of matches and fatigue is a manager from an English club, because England is a special place. When the French players were on holidays at Christmas, we were playing five matches in 10 days.' There was also a reminder, at a time when Blanc's future is uncertain, that he rejected the chance to take control at PSG and has seen the masterplan. 'I know the PSG project well because when they started, I was to be the coach,' said Mourinho. 'I met them in Qatar. The project was to start dominating in France, to dominate in Europe. Paris is a big team with big ambitions.' When Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012, they finished sixth in the Premier League . PSG manager Laurent Blanc has said that he wants his team to ignore Jose Mourinho's words . Nemanja Matic is available to play having been ineligible during last season's clash with PSG . Cesc Fabregas (left) has also joined Chelsea in what many consider a much stronger side from last year . Eden Hazard (left) should feature for Chelsea and recently signed a new five-year deal with the club . The slogan inside PSG's famous stadium is: 'Dream Bigger', and yet the mood is that they have taken a step back while Chelsea have progressed since the teams met last year. Mourinho has added Costa, the striker he felt he lacked when he played Andre Schurrle up front in Paris and lost 3-1. Nemanja Matic was not available in  Europe last season, and there is Cesc Fabregas who has missed the last three games, but for 20 minutes against Everton, last week and is fighting illness to be fit today. Then there is Eden Hazard, fresh from committing his long-term future to Chelsea by signing a contract until 2020. Last year, PSG tried to lure him across the Channel and Mourinho was not impressed when the Belgian appeared wearing a PSG shirt in a post-match interview with canal+. After signing last week, Hazard said he was never going to leave. 'He was always a good kid,' said Mourinho. 'When a talent like him doesn't sign a contract it's normal to have speculation but nobody signs a five year contract without being convinced of his happiness.' In contrast, PSG have their injury crisis, discontent on the terraces and Blanc is taking criticism personally. 'I'll take the responsibility for the negativity around the Caen game (a 2-2 draw),' said Blanc. 'It was a catastrophe but, I'm responsible.'

Former Premier League midfielder Yohan Cabaye has been ruled out of his side's match against the Blues .

He is accused of rushing Yohan Cabaye back from injury too soon, prompting the recurrence of a groin strain in a game PSG finished with nine men, due to injuries. Cabaye, Serge Aurier and Lucas Moura have been ruled out and, although only Moura may have started, there was a depressed air which even the presence of David Luiz, with his sunny disposition and bright orange hoodie could not lift. Asked to compare the two managers, Luiz quipped: 'They're both ugly.' Luiz flashed a grin but Blanc did not react. 'They do not understand me,' shrugged the oft-misunderstood Brazilian.","Jose Mourinho feels  English teams have it harder than those in Europe .

"Social networks are increasingly being linked with addiction and mental illness, and now a new study claims Twitter could even bring on episodes of psychosis. In the study, researchers from Berlin presented the case of a 31-year-old woman who had been hospitalised after developing delusions, which were linked to her ‘excessive’ use of Twitter. After studying how the social network influenced the patient’s perception, the researchers proposed social media has the potential to ‘aggravate or even induce psychotic symptoms’. However, they were quick to note that . Twitter, and social media in general, only has this effect on . particularly vulnerable patients who are already predisposed to . psychosis. Scroll down for video . Researchers from Berlin presented the case of a 31-year-old 'Mrs C.', who had been hospitalised after developing delusions, which were linked to her ‘excessive’ use of Twitter. They proposed social media has the potential to ‘to induce psychotic symptoms’ - but only with vulnerable people already predisposed to psychosis . Lead researcher, Dr Jan Kalbitzer, physician at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, told MailOnline that this study was published to raise the issue, and refers to an individual case study. He continued that he's seen very few cases over the past years, and added: 'At this point you should not be worried about Twitter psychosis as a normal user.' In May, researchers from Tel Aviv University similarly linked psychotic episodes in patients to internet addiction. These were blamed on delusions caused by virtual relationships cultivated on social networking sites. Although all the participants had underlying problems of loneliness, none had any history of psychosis or drug abuse, the team said. Lead researcher Doctor Uri Nitzan of Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and the Shalvata Mental Health Care Centre said: 'As internet access becomes increasingly widespread, so do related psychopathologies. 'Computer communications such as Facebook and chat groups are an important part of this story.' The woman referenced in the study was a 31-year-old dubbed 'Mrs C'. She was hospitalised for intensive suicidal thoughts and compulsions, but had no previous history of psychiatric illness. The symptoms began approximately eight months before she was hospitalised, and four months in, Mrs C’s family reported she was using Twitter ‘excessively.’ This was defined as ‘several hours a day’ and led to her ‘neglecting relationships, meals and sleeping hours.’ She started suffering from delusions that a celebrity was talking to her, through hidden and symbolic messages in tweets - and that she had to react to these so-called ‘tasks’ the celebrity was giving her. This symbols then began appearing in her offline world and she reported paranoid delusions that a sect, or organisation, were behind the tasks. Dr Kalbitzer continued: 'The main problems at Twitter are the spam bots and the abbreviations. 'Due to the structure of Twitter, it is quite easy to program spam bots for it, and the use of abbreviations is promoted by the limitation to 140 characters. 'Furthermore, . people on Twitter can have the impression that they are personally . addressed because the spam bots get more active if they get more active. 'And, . although we have no formal proof for that, we had the impression that . the spam bots sometimes send tweets with confusing abbreviations in . order to create curiosity to follow a link. 'Or in the case of our patients cause or add to the development of psychiatric symptoms.' The researchers linked their findings to the combination of 'the amount of symbolic language, caused by the limitation of 140 characters per Twitter message, the automated spam responses with seemingly related content, and the general interactive features of Twitter' ‘We wanted to spark a discussion about what Twitter does to our minds and chose a provocative title to bring this subject up.’ 'If you sit . in front of your computer now and feel unsure what to think, call . someone you trust, go and have a coffee together and talk about . your feelings,' said Dr Kalbitzer. 'If you realise while talking about it, that it makes you feel uncomfortable, you might want to cut down on your internet use, then try to cut down. 'If . you can’t cut down on it, even though you want to, or if you realise you experience things that sound odd to other people, you should . consider speaking to someone professional. 'But in many cases you will just realise you are not different than other people.' The article was published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. When asked if his team would be carrying out any follow-up research, Dr Kalbitzer said: 'Definitely. The fact that a single case study caused such a world-wide attention is a clear indicator that we know way too little about the effect of social media on mental health.' However, researchers from the University of Louisville recently claimed social networks can help support people with mental illnesses, because they give people the opportunity to meet and connect with others going through the same thing. ‘Through sharing pictures, videos and stories about their families’ highs and lows support group members are able to get to know each other better and form a deeper connection with one another,’ said the university. Similarly, a study from the University of Missouri last year found that that social networks are useful tools to help diagnose a person’s psychiatric condition, by studying how they behave on the sites. Researchers in Milan also found social networks can spark a natural high leading to a relaxed heart rate and lower levels of stress and tension.","The research was carried out by at Charité Universitätsmedizin, Berlin .

"An audio tape of Bill Clinton released on Wednesday confirmed longstanding reports that he 'could have killed' Osama bin Laden but decided not to because he was concerned about civilian casualties in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The audio recording, made with Clinton's permission by former president of Australia's Liberal Party Michael Kroger and released to Sky News by Kroger, reveals Clinton telling the former Australian politician and more than two dozen Australian businessman about the missed opportunity during a visit to Australia several months after the end of his presidency. The conversation eerily took place the day before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks masterminded by bin Laden. 'Osama bin Laden -- he's a very smart guy. I've spent a lot of time thinking about him, and I nearly got him once,' Clinton can be heard saying in the recording. Scroll down for video . Audio of a meeting between former President Bill Clinton and former Australian political leader Michael Kroger from Sept. 10, 2001, reveals that Clinton had the opportunity to kill Osama Bin Laden when he was president but didn't . 'I nearly . got him. And I could have gotten, I could have killed him, but I would . have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill . 300 innocent women and children.' 'And then I would have been no better than him,' Clinton said. 'And so I didn't do it.' Kandahar is the spiritual home of the Taliban, and it became the physical home of bin Laden during Clinton's second term as president. Bin Laden was believed to be living at a compound in Kandahar called Tarnak Farms at the time. Clinton's account of the abandoned bin Laden mission matches up with a 2004 NBC News report that showed the Clinton administration had eyes on bin Laden in the 2000 and in a 2005 book that claimed Clinton once has the chance to take out bin Laden but didn't. During the 9/11 investigation NBC obtained a secret, CIA video of Tarnak Farms taken by Predator drones in the fall of 2000. The images in the video are difficult to make out to the untrained eye, but an intelligence analyst for NBC said the video shows a man roughly the same height as bin Laden in white robes walking around the compound protected by guards. The NBC report indicated that all intelligence suggested the man in the video was bin Laden and questioned why the government didn't kill him at that time. 'We were not prepared to take the military action necessary,' retired Gen. Wayne Downing, who ran counter-terror efforts for the Bush administration, told NBC. Osama bin Laden, was later killed in a Navy SEAL raid in . 2011, but not before carrying out the deadly September, 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people . The same incident was the subject of Pulitzer Prize winning author Steve Coll's 2005 book Ghost Wars and rehashed in journalist Jane Mayer's New York Times bestselling book - The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals - four years after NBC's report. In The Dark Side, Mayer summarizes Coll's reporting, explaining that through the use of Predator drones, bin Laden . 'could be watched as he walked through the primitive, undefended, . mud-walled compound he and his terrorist associates and their families . inhabited in the bleak, sage-brush-strewn plains outside of Kandahar, . Afghanistan. 'The video imagery was so exquisitely detailed, U.S. officials viewing the videotapes at the CIA and White House could make out a lone child’s swing hanging in the compound,' she wrote. 'The robed man seemed to present an irresistible target for missile attack. But the swing haunted Clinton. 'The swing suggested innocent children lived there,' she noted. 'The United States, for all of its military prowess, was a hamstrung Gulliver in the face of Lilliputian terrorists willing to sacrifice innocent lives in a way no civilized nation could.' Previous reporting on Clinton's hesitancy to kill bin Laden also indicates that the former president was pressured by then-Attorney General Janet Reno not to use deadly force to capture terrorist targets. The CIA had 'no written word nor verbal order to conduct a lethal action' mission against bin Laden before the September 11 terrorist attack, a Clinton administration official told The Washington Post in 2004. 'The objective was to render this guy to law enforcement.' A record of Bill Clinton's paid speeches . shows that Clinton was in fact in Australia on the day that Kroger, the Australian businessman who released the tape, says the audio of Clinton was recorded. A comprehensive list of Clinton's speeches published by the Washington Post shows that Clinton was paid $150,000 by J.T. Campbell & Co. Pty. Ltd. to give remarks on Sept. 10, 2001 in Melbourne, which confirms Kroger's account. During his interview with Sky News, Kroger said he kept the audio tape secret until now because he simply forgot about it. It was not until last week, when Bill Clinton was . back in Australia for the opening of Torrens University Australia in . Adelaide, that Kroger said he remembered the conversation.","Clinton made the remarks in front of a group of Australian businessman on September 10, 2001 .

"The wife of Michael Schumacher is reportedly spending £10million on building a fully equipped medical suite in their family home so her husband can leave the hospital. Even though Corinna Schumacher, 45, has been told by doctors it is highly unlikely the racing ace will ever wake up from his medically induced coma, she has decided to use the family's £500million fortune to build the facility in their lavish £25million estate on the banks of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. Today is the three month anniversary of the Alps skiing accident where the seven-time F1 champion, 45, hit his head and was put into an induced coma to reduce brain swelling. Bring him home: Reports had claimed that Corinna planned to build a multi-million pound facility so her husband can leave hospital, but these were subsequently denied by family and friends of the former F1 ace . Successful: The £25million estate on the shores of Lake Geneva where the Schumacher family live . Since then, there have been few encouraging signs of recovery and the racing ace has been wasting away in his hospital bed, losing 25 per cent of his body mass to now only weigh 8st 7lbs. A friend of the Schumacher's, who has known the family for 25 years The Sun said: 'Miracles happen, of course, and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy. 'But all the money in the world cannot fix what has happened to him. The family are making arrangements for a future of permanent immobility. 'Is there a sense of denial at play among them? I would say yes' The family's life has been taken over by the accident, every day they make the 150-mile round trip from their home in Switzerland to the Grenoble University Hospital, France, where Schumacher is receiving the best possible care. They spend up to ten hours by his bedside, offering up prayers for his recovery, before returning home in the evening. Keen skier: Thrill-seeker Schumacher had been a keen and skilled skier before his accident in December . Waiting: The Grenoble University Hospital, where Schumacher has been in an induced coma for three months . Mrs Schumacher has always been a devoted wife, extremely supportive of her husband's career. Mr Schumacher once said: 'It is not so easy to find a partner who unconditionally adapts to the pace of my life.' Both growing up in the same region of West Germany, Michael and Corinna Schumacher met at a party in 1991 and fell in love. The pact that has seen their loving relationship endure is that she allows him pursue his high-octane career and, in return, he would give her everything she could want. With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years.  This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts. He used the staggering fortunes from his 22-year career to snap up a ranch in Texas, where Corinna raises horses, as well as apartments and ski chalets around the world - including the one in Meribel from which he set out on the tragic day late last year. Loving support: Corinna arrives at the hospital to which she and family make a daily 150-mile round trip . He even built the estate on Lake Geneva where the new medical facility will be installed. As a result, Mrs Schumacher refuses to give up on the man she once described as the 'perfect partner'. The family friend told The Sun she 'would view breaking faith with the hope of a miracle a betrayal, little better than treachery. 'She feels that the family communes around his bedside pulsate their hope and love to him, and that of the millions of fans worldwide who share that faith. 'She can’t express defeat because that would be the end of her.'","The medical facility will be built in the family's £25million Swiss estate .

"Wants her job back: 999 call handler Sue Heeney (pictured) claims she was sacked by Essex Police for being 'too jolly' after chuckling with a caller . A 999 operator who 'laughed and . sniggered' throughout a call from a man reporting that a suspected drink-driver may have been involved in a hit-and-run has been sacked for gross misconduct. Sue . Heeney failed to 'grasp the seriousness of the situation' after joking . with the caller when he made a mistake while giving her the registration . of the car. A disciplinary . hearing was told that she 'got the giggles' and from then on 'failed to . deal with the conversation in a sober and professional manner'. She then graded the call with the incorrect heading 'suspicious circumstances' rather than 'non-stop road traffic collision'. Miss . Heeney, 38, who worked for Essex Police, had been told by the caller . that a member of his own family may have been drink-driving. But she did not . take immediate steps to start an investigation or gather evidence that . could have helped with the search for the suspect or victims. It was only when a dispatcher realised the seriousness of the incident that more immediate action was taken. The . adjudicator said: 'It is extremely fortunate that the dispatcher who . picked up this incident, reviewed and reassessed its nature and urgency . and took effective action.' The driver in question was found to have been involved in two collisions that evening and failed to stop at both of them. One of the victims was a cyclist who was lucky to escape serious injury, it was heard. Dismissing . her for gross misconduct, the adjudicator ruled her actions 'could have . potentially put lives at risk and adversely affected public . confidence'. The call, which . was made on November 9 last year, became light-hearted when the caller, . Paul Turner, struggled to recall the phonetic alphabet and suggested 'E . as in Edward - I don’t know the proper one'. Mother-of-two Miss Heeney corrected him that it was 'echo'. A recording of the conversation reveals the caller laughs first, saying: 'I don’t know the proper one'. After some giggling by both, the caller adds: 'You will be laughing all night now'. Call centre: Essex Police headquarters in Springfield, Chelmsford, where Sue Heeney worked for four years . A . letter from a detective inspector investigating the matter for Essex . Police to Miss Heeney said: 'During the call, when receiving details . from the caller, you started to laugh excessively at a mistake the . caller had made and you continued to laugh and snigger throughout the . call.' Miss Heeney, of Marks Tey, near Colchester, Essex, says she chuckled with the caller to 'help him relax'. She admitted mis-grading the call, but claimed the call was made more than three hours after the alleged incidents. Speaking after the hearing, she said: 'I was told I was being too jolly, laughing and happy on the phone. 'The . grounds given were that I could have potentially put someone's life at . risk and have a dangerous effect on public confidence. 'It . was not at his expense - he said something funny and I laughed with . him. It got him over his nerves and helped him to relax.' Investigating officer . Miss . Heeney - who had worked at police HQ in Chelmsford, Essex, for four . years before the incident - has now launched an appeal against her . sacking. 'People need to . know they are talking to a friendly human, not a robot, and you can . build a rapport with them. Friendly and helpful is what the public . wants. 'I've spoken to the caller since and he can't believe what has happened. There have been calls where I have literally saved someone's life.' Paul Turner, who said it was an agonising decision to make the call, was shocked to learn Miss Heeney had been sacked. He made the call, which involved a family member, after much deliberation over the impact it might have on his family relationship. He . said: 'I was very nervous about making the call but through her . professionalism I was able to tell her everything that happened and all . the details. 'If she had not been so good, or if I’d had someone blunt and rude, I would have hung up.' A . police spokesman said: 'Essex Police can confirm the civilian member of . staff was dismissed from the force for gross misconduct following an . allegation of negligence.

"Tottenham Hotspur are braced for a High Court battle, which starts on Tuesday, against a local business standing in the way of  their proposed £400million redevelopment of White Hart Lane. Archway Sheet Metal Works is beginning a two-day application before Mr Justice Dove, who revealed at a preliminary hearing that he is an Aston Villa fan. The owners of Archway are challenging the confirmation of a compulsory purchase order that could force them to make way for the new 56,000-capacity stadium complex. Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd, based right next to White Hart Lane's North Stand, are the sole business fighting to prevent Tottenham obtaining the land they need to build a new 56,000-capacity stadium . Tottenham's vision for their new stadium, which they hope to have completed by 2018 . An artist's representation of the proposed interior for Tottenham's state-of-the-art new stadium . Last November, a mystery fire gutted the premises near the North Stand at Tottenham's White Hart Lane ground in north London. The blaze prompted an investigation from the London Fire Brigade into the cause. The owners said they had received 'bomb threats'. Josif Josif, 46, who runs the family business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.' The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry. The owners have been in a dispute with Spurs for the last decade over its redevelopment plans. The club has planning permission for the new stadium it hopes to open for the 2018-19 season.

A Tottenham club spokesman said: 'We have already successfully and amicably relocated more than 70 businesses in the area to the satisfaction of all parties concerned and a number of these organisations continue to reside in the borough. 'Whilst we were able to accommodate all these other businesses' requests, in the instance of Archway, we have been unable to reach agreement over the period of the last seven years.' Tottenham have been accused of misleading supporters in their ongoing dispute. After seven years of negotiations failed to reach a conclusion, the club secured a compulsory purchase order last July forcing Archway to sell their land. But the company challenged the decision. Spurs are well along the line of redeveloping White Hart Lane, their home since 1899 . The likes of Mousa Dembele (second left) will hope to be playing in Spurs' new ground soon . Tottenham's season is going well on the pitch, with the club chasing a Champions League spot . Directors of Archway, owned by the Josif Family, accused Tottenham of causing delay to the hearing. Archway also claim the compulsory purchase order is 'unlawful and unfair' because Spurs and Haringey Council did not make information public about their plans before it was granted. A spokesman said: 'This information relates to secret discussions between the club and various public bodies concerning major changes to the club's scheme on which the case for compulsory purchase of our land was based.' Tottenham were hoping they would be able to move into their new stadium by the start of the 2017-18 season, but believe the delay in construction due to Archway has made that highly unlikely.

"A bullied schoolgirl who responded to having her locker robbed by spreading encouraging messages on Post-It notes - but was yelled at by her teachers for littering. Caitlin Prater-Haacke, an 11th-grader who lives in a suburb of Calgary, Canada, had her school locker vandalized by bullies, who took her iPad and used it to post cruel messages on her Facebook. But rather than retaliate, the student decided to spread happiness instead, and came into school last week armed with 850 Post-It notes covered in messages like 'You're awesome!' and 'Be yourself'. Brave response: Caitlin Prater-Haacke, a Canadian 11th-grader, started her 'positive Post-It' campaign in response to being bullied . Love on the lockers: Caitlin had he locker broken into and cruel messages posted on her Facebook - but responded by putting encouraging notes on other students' lockers . She stuck the messages the locker of every student at George McDougall High School in Airdrie, Alberta, in the hope of making everybody smile. But she was swiftly disciplined by her teachers, who classified the notes as litter. Caitlin was pulled out of class, shouted at by staff and told that the school janitors are not there to clean up her mess, the Calgary Sun reported. Yelled at: However, teachers disagreed with Caitlin's actions and told her off for putting up the notes . Her mother, Nicole Haacke, told the paper: 'I don't understand that when my kid is bullied, nothing happens, but when she tries to do something positive, she is punished.' Caitlin said she wrote and stuck up the notes to 'do something positive', and because bullying at her school is 'not necessarily addressed'. However, despite the reaction from school authorities, the wider community rallied round her and started spreading similar Post-Its around the town. Fightback: However, other students rallied around Caitlin and gave her campaign extra momentum. Her teachers also changed their mind . Hashtag: The trend gathered momentum on social media as well . The trend spread to social media too, congregating under the #PositivePostIt hashtag. The Staples store in Airdrie even got in on the act, giving away the notes for free. Caitlin's initiative culminated in a Positive Post-It Day event on Thursday - which her school supported. Recanting their earlier position, teachers allowed their students to put up the messages - after they had promised to clean up after themselves. George McDougall High School could not be reached for comment.","Caitlin Prater-Haacker had her locker robbed and Facebook hijacked .

"When Cola the cat was born, Margaret Thatcher was running the country, Back to the Future was topping the box office and rapper Dizzee Rascal was a newborn baby. Now, after 28 years, the feline is set to celebrate a milestone birthday - turning 140 in cat years and being crowned Britain's oldest moggy. Until . now a cat called Wadsworth, from Ravensden, Bedfordshire, was . thought to hold the crown of Britain's oldest living feline - after celebrating . his 27th birthday this year. Born in the eighties: Cola will turn 28 this year and is believed to be Britain's oldest cat . But Cola, who was born in in November 1985, trumps him by several months. The cat, whose favourite foods are cream, custard and salmon, has only been to the vet once - to get spayed. Mary Goldsmith, 66, has lived with her pet at her home in Orpington, south-east London, since Cola was a kitten. She put her cat’s extraordinary long life down to lots of treats and regular walks with her pet dog, and said: 'I don’t throw big birthday parties for her, because every day she is around is a celebration. 'We have had children who have grown up to have their own families and Cola has lived through all that and is still around. It’s quite a milestone. The years have absolutely flown by. Curiosity hasn't killed this cat: Britain's oldest feline Cola with her owner Mary Goldsmith . 'The secret to her long life is love and spoiling. She loves her luxuries like cream, custard and salmon. She always has a good nibble from my plate as well as her own cat food. 'I’ve got children, grandchildren and great grandchildren who come over to play with her and keep her busy.' Apart from a touch of arthritis in her old age, Cola has always been as fit as a fiddle. Mrs Goldsmith, who has four grandchildren and two great grandchildren, said: 'She has been lucky and not really had many close shaves or problems. 'The nearest she came to getting unstuck was on one of our trips out. 'She used to go on walks with me and our pet Collie dog to the park, she would sit in the tree while me and the dog played and then follow us home. 'But once a Staffie dog spotted her and chased Cola all the way home. That was a nerve-racking experience for her, but luckily she out ran him. 'She was quite a sprightly cat in her day, she loved chasing birds and would catch mice and sometimes bring them into the house. 'She is still reasonably fit for her age and can still jump onto a chair - but she doesn’t have quite the same spring in her step.' The retired school cleaner said a healthy dose of treats has kept her moggy in top shape. She said: 'She is quite a hardy cat. I have pampered her a bit with her treats - probably most vets would say she shouldn’t have this or that, but she is still going strong.' Still not lost her fizz: Cola has reached the grand old age of 140 in cat years . Born at the bottom of a wardrobe at Mrs Goldsmith’s mother-in-law’s home in Bromley Common, Cola has gone on to have three litters of kittens and was a 'fantastic mum'. Cola will be Britain's oldest cat when she turns 28 in November . Mrs Goldsmith’s husband Brian, 72, a retired driver, said: 'She has always been very friendly and is a real favourite with our grandchildren - they have kept her fit by playing with her. 'We have always had lots of animals - cats, dogs, hamsters, rabbits, chinchillas - and Cola has got on with them all. 'She has lived to such a grand age. Perhaps she really does have nine lives? She is a lucky black cat, that’s for sure. 'Hopefully she still has a few years left in her, although she isn’t as sprightly as she one was she still has some go in her.' The Goldsmiths are desperate to discover if their beloved moggy is the oldest in the world - and said they would be 'overjoyed' if she claimed the title. Mrs Goldsmith said: 'I’ve never heard of another cat reach her age, so I wondered if she was the oldest in the country. 'I would really love to know if she is. I would be over the moon if she was crowned the world’s oldest cat.' According to Guinness World Records, the oldest living cat is 23-year-old Pinky, born on October 31, 1989 from Kansas, U.S. However, there were reports in June of a 31-year-old cat called Sarah living in New Zealand. The normal lifespan for a cat is between nine and 15 years.","Black cat will turn 28 this year, or the old age of 140 in cat years .

"One of Britain's leading plastic surgeons has been charged with attacking his estranged wife and step daughter in an angry confrontation inside their family home. Laurence Kirwan, whose celebrity clients include TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, was arrested in Connecticut last Friday after his estranged wife, Chelsea Chapman Kirwan, called the police. The 60-year-old surgeon - a regular TV commentator who was recently named by Tatler as the plastic surgeon 'best for breast and tummies' - left the £1.7 million home in Greenwich, Connecticut, before arresting officers arrived. Facing court: One of Britain's leading plastic surgeons, Laurence Kirwan, pictured, has been charged with attacking his estranged wife and step daughter in an angry confrontation inside their family home . But he later turned himself in to police, and was arrested and placed in custody. He appeared in Stamford Superior Court on Monday morning and was released on £3,160 bail. He has been charged with third degree assault and disorderly conduct against his alleged victims - Mrs Chapman Kirwan, 40, and her daughter 18-year-old Tailor Dortona. Police say there were several children in the house at the time and Prof Kirwan also faces a more serious felony charge of 'injury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals of children'. He could face at least five years behind bars if convicted, a police source revealed. Dallas-born Mrs Chapman Kirwan married her alleged attacker after becoming one of his patients. Investigation: The 60-year-old surgeon has been charged with third degree assault and disorderly conduct against his alleged victims - Chelsea Chapman Kirwan, left, and her daughter 18-year-old Tailor Dortona, seated centre next to her mum . A devotee of cosmetic surgery, she says she has had numerous operations on her nose, breasts, and eyebrows as well as sundry Botox injections. The couple have three young children together - twins Felicity and Lilibet, and Ophelia, who was born with Down's Syndrome. Liverpool-born Prof Kirwan has offices in New York, Harley Street and Connecticut, where he lives. Public records reveal Prof Kirwan was listed as living at the five-bedroom, 5,050 square foot home between 2007 and 2011. Court sources say a 'full protective order' has been issued in the case, meaning Prof Kirwan is temporarily banned from living under the same roof as any of his children covered by the order. Close: Chelsea Kirwan is pictured with her daughter Ophelia, who has Down's Syndrome . Court papers reveal he will be allowed contact with them, but only as part of a supervised visit. However, he is not allowed to get in touch with Mrs Chapman Kirwan after a 'no contact' order was put in place by the courts. According to the police report on the incident, officers responded to a 'reported domestic violence incident with an active assault occurring'. It added: 'On arrival, two victims were observed to have minor injuries. The perpetrator was no longer at the scene.' Prof Kirwan later turned himself into police at their headquarters in Greenwich, an ultra wealthy community near New York, and was placed under arrest. When asked where he lived, he gave police the address of his surgery in the nearby town of Norwalk. Calls to Prof Kirwan, his wife and their lawyers for comment were not returned. He is due back in court on September 23. According to Prof Kirwan's website, his surgery philosophy is 'never to do so much that the patient looks unnatural and never to do too little so that improvement is only in the eye of the beholder.' He says his 'constant goal is to improve the aesthetics and quite simply create ageless beauty, whether it be a harmony of form or a recreation of youthful features'. His website also provides a link to his entry in Debrett's People of Today, in which he lists his recreations as 'writing [and] spending time with family'.

"Something quite ­magical happens when great-grandmother Paddy Jones dances. ­Shimmering in sequins, with a salsa swivel of the hips, she is ­transformed from the 79-year-old that she is into the ­nimble young woman she once was. In the arms of her Spanish dance ­partner, Nico Espinosa — 40 years her junior — the years melt away as he tosses her in the air in a series of graceful, gravity-defying moves which would leave most ­pensioners needing an emergency hip replacement. ‘Nico throws me round like a whirling dervish. But I don’t even feel stiff ­afterwards, which is really quite amazing,’ explains Paddy, who last Saturday became an ­overnight sensation when her ­Britain’s Got Talent audition was shown. Scroll down for video . Great grandmother Paddy Jones, who appeared on Britain's Got Talent with her partner Nico Espinosa . She even managed to wipe the ­studied, weary look of boredom off the face of head judge Simon Cowell, who actually ­apologised for pressing his red buzzer to vote her off before he realised how good she was. Quite a feat in itself. Gold tickertape rained down on her snowy white hair — which was perfectly shampooed and set — when Cowell’s ­fellow judge Amanda Holden, pressed the golden buzzer, ­catapulting Paddy into next month’s live semi-finals. Quite how Paddy and Nico plan to top last Saturday’s performance remains to be seen, but let’s hope it won’t require the ­presence of an ­ambulance waiting in the wings. ‘I know my limits,’ says Paddy. ‘Nico wanted to try out a new move in rehearsals which involved going down on my haunches. ‘Well, I managed to get down, but I couldn’t get up again. We had to scrub that. ‘Sometimes Nico will get out the crash mats when we are trying something new, but he has never dropped me yet. I trust him completely.’ The 79-year-old made it into the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest ­acrobatic salsa dancer . Sarah ‘Paddy’ Jones is the perfect ­Britain’s Got Talent contestant, ­possessing the essential ‘wow’ ­factor and a ­moving back story. A trained ballerina, she started dancing at the age of two-and-a-half and became a ­professional ­performer until she gave it all up after marrying her late ­husband David. Paddy, a former dental nurse and fabric shop owner from ­Stourbridge, West ­Midlands, who retired to Spain with David in 2001, only took up dancing again ten years ago. Devastated after her husband’s death from leukaemia in 2003, she found herself widowed and alone in a foreign country. Their four adult ­children and grandchildren were back in Britain, although they tried to visit as often as possible. So to fill her lonely evenings and learn to have fun again she started taking salsa classes at Nico’s dance academy in Gandia near Valencia. The rest, as they say, is television history. Today Paddy is being hailed as the dancing equivalent of Susan Boyle, who in 2009 stunned the BGT judges and the world when she sang I Dreamed A Dream from Les Miserables. When I meet her, the gloss has been somewhat wiped off her achievement, with some critics ­suggesting she had no right to be on the show. In the wake of her jaw-dropping performance it emerged that Paddy and Nico — far from being plucked from obscurity — had in 2009 won a Spanish TV talent ­contest called Tu Si Que Vales (You Are Worth It). The following year the couple ­competed in the ­Argentinian ­equivalent of Strictly Come Dancing, from which they were voted off in round 11. That year, Paddy made it into the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s oldest ­acrobatic salsa dancer. On Twitter, Cowell defended his newest star, saying ‘Don’t knock Paddy . . . she is ­British and wants the chance to perform in front of the Royal Family.’ A spokesman for BGT, made by Thames TV and Cowell’s ­production company Syco ­Entertainment, added: ‘Anyone can apply for ­Britain’s Got Talent, ­irrespective of their past ­experience. ‘None of the judging panel had seen or knew of Paddy before her audition and her act was a ­complete surprise to them.’ The Britain's Got Talent judges were wowed by Paddy's performance, especially Amanda Holden, who pressed the golden buzzer for them . Paddy, who will be 80 in July, finds it hard to understand what all the fuss is about. ‘I’m British and I’ve got ­talent, so why shouldn’t I enter?’ she asks, slightly flummoxed by the ­brouhaha. ‘It’s a terrible thing to admit — ­neither of us knew anything about the show. I think my son Philip mentioned it to me. I really didn’t think we’d stand a cat’s chance in hell of ­getting through.’ Despite the furore, who could ­honestly begrudge this soon-to-be octogenarian her late-life moment in the sun? ‘I’m very active and young at heart,’ explains Paddy, who has seven grandchildren aged from eight to 32, and a great-grandson aged three. ‘I once overheard one of my son’s friends at a fancy dress party asking “Is your Mum ever going to grow up?” I’d come as a pirate.’ The only child of a regimental ­tailor, Paddy performed in her first panto aged 12 and was working full-time in theatre when, aged 17, she met David, an electrical engineer. ‘When we married I gave it up — it was my choice — because if you’re working six days a week on stage you are going out for an evening show just as your better half is coming home from work,’ says Paddy. ‘I missed dancing terribly, ­especially as David had two left feet and didn’t know the difference between a quickstep and a waltz. But I never once regretted my ­decision. Family life was more important.’ Daughter Lesley, now aged 55, was followed by three brothers Nicolas, 54, a scout leader, Andrew, 51, a ­computer scientist and Philip, 49, a partner in an accountancy firm. Paddy says she finds it hard to understand what all the fuss is about . Paddy kept her interest in ­showbusiness alive by founding the ­Stourbridge ­Pantomime Company — still going strong today. The couple, happily married for 47 years, retired to Spain after Paddy collapsed on Christmas Eve 2000 with flu and David said he couldn’t let her endure another ­British ­winter. They fell in love with a mountainside villa in Gandia, and had sold their semi-detached ­Victorian home in the Midlands when disaster struck. The day before they were due to fly out to sign the paperwork, David fell ill and was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. The Spanish villa lay empty for eight months while David ­underwent several rounds of ­chemotherapy — keeping a picture of their dream home by his hospital bed to give him a morale boost. With David’s cancer in remission, they finally moved to Spain in ­September 2001, only for the ­leukaemia to return 18 months later. He was given two months to live after two further rounds of chemo failed. ‘I put his bed in the lounge ­overlooking the valley, but when the doctor came he said David had a week or ten days left,’ says Paddy. ‘Our children made ­immediate plans to fly out, but David died the exact time their plane took off from Britain. When they arrived I had to tell them, “I’m sorry, it’s too late, he’s gone.” ’ In the wake of her jaw-dropping performance it emerged that Paddy and Nico had in 2009 won a Spanish TV talent ­contest called Tu Si Que Vales (You Are Worth It) ‘By the end he was skin and bone, so I was prepared for his death and held him in my arms and talked to him at the end. Everyone assumed I would come home, but I was determined to stay because we’d been so happy. ‘I kept myself busy, gardening all day until it got dark and then ­falling into bed exhausted. I didn’t have a ­television, so when autumn came I thought I’d better find something else to keep me busy. ‘I was the oldest person at Nico’s by far, but salsa is very inclusive. Men over there don’t think, “Oh, I can’t dance with an old lady.” ‘ . ‘I think Nico was quite ­surprised by what I could do,’ says Paddy, who is 4ft 11 and a ­featherweight 7st. ‘One day he asked me how much I weighed and said “Bien” when I told him. The first time he tried to throw me in the air, he  asked some other men to stand around him to catch me if I fell, but I just went for it. I didn’t even worry about being injured.’ Paddy describes her relationship with Nico, who is unmarried, as being like that of mother and son. It was his idea to start entering ­competitions: ‘He couldn’t find someone willing to be thrown up in the air except a silly, elderly widow. So could Paddy and Nico win ­Britain’s Got Talent? ‘It would be an absolute honour for me to perform in front of the Queen,’ says Paddy. ‘I went into dancing again because I was on my own. I had lost David. I just hope he’d be proud of me now.’","Paddy Jones, 79, wowed the judges on Britain's Got Talent with her dancing .

"American expats are giving up their passports as new government rules target tax evaders . The number of Americans renouncing their U.S. citizenship remains near a record high, ahead of new rules being introduced to clamp down on tax evaders. In the first half of the year, 1,577 Americans gave up their nationalities at U.S. embassies across the world, according to Federal Register data. This was only the second time the figures have been more than 1,500 since records began in 1998. Harsher asset-disclosure rules came into effect on July 1, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca), meaning that foreign banks such as those in Switzerland are turning over data on their American clients to the U.S. government. More than 100 Swiss banks are handing over information to avoid prosecution for helping tax evaders, leading 576 American expatriates to renounce their citizenship in the second quarter. Matthew Ledvina, a U.S. tax lawyer at Anaford AG in Zurich, told Bloomberg: 'Fatca and the Swiss bank disclosure program has intensified the search for U.S. nationals beyond all measure. 'It's shocking the levels of due diligence they are going through to ensure they have cleaned house.' The USA is the only Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nation that taxes citizens wherever they live. This means that to expats who want to avoid paying higher, U.S. level taxes, the idea of giving up their passports is becoming more attractive. Almost 9,000 Americans have given up their nationalities in the past five years. This year's figures are down 13 per cent on the same time last year, but still remain far higher than ever before. Up until 2010, the number rarely exceeded 200 per quarter. For the first quarter of 2014, it was 1,001. Swiss bank UBS AG was fined $780m and forced to hand over data on 4,700 accounts in 2009, triggering the U.S. government's clamp down on expatriates evading tax . According to a survey held last November by the deVere Group in Zurich, the number of Americans renouncing their citizenship could continue to stay high. Of 400 expatriates questioned, more than two thirds said they had considered it. It is estimated that around six million Americans are currently living abroad. The government's step up in their search for tax evaders was triggered in 2009, when UBS AG (UBSN) paid a $780m fine for aiding them, and was forced to give up information on around 4,700 accounts. Swiss banks are now going back through their records as far as the 1990s to find any traces of American clients, including people with U.S. addresses or phone numbers, or even those who were schooled there. All the people they find are either being asked to leave the bank, or being placed into separate, U.S.-only sections, where they will pay American tax rates. Fatca was enacted in 2010 by Congress to target  U.S. taxpayers who were using foreign bank accounts and were not complying with U.S. tax laws. It came into effect on July 1, after being delayed for 18 months in order to give foreign banks time to comply with it. It requires banks to report information to the IRS  about  accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest. It also requires U.S. financial institutions to impose a 30 per cent withholding tax on all payments made to foreign banks that do not agree to work with the government by sending them information on account holders. It allows the U.S. government to obtain data from more than 77,000 institutions and 80 governments about its citizens’  financial activities abroad.","More than 1,500 expats gave up their passports in first half of 2014 .

As with previous arrests of journalists over the past week, no charges were filed against Olson, who by Monday night was back shooting photos. The shooting of the unarmed black teenager by white cop Darren Wilson has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5am. Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order. He deployed the Guard Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called ‘a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'. Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol. Meanwhile, a second friend of Officer Wilson has come forward to defend the cop, describing him as a 'really quiet, well-mannered, respectful guy', who never showed any signs of violence. The male friend of the Michael Brown shooter spoke to GMA on Tuesday but asked that his identity be concealed for his own safety. The friend has been exchanging text messages with the 28-year-old Ferguson officer and said: 'I can tell that this is really hard on him.'

"Plans for the next stage in the fight against terrorism could be in the toilet -  quite literally. Swedish scientists have developed sensors that can be fitted inside waste tunnels and used to detect bomb making chemicals in sewage. If suspect chemicals are detected, the sensor alerts the authorities who can carry out infrared laser ‘sweeps’ above ground to locate the precise location of the bomb-making factory. The Swedish Defence Research Agency has developed sensors fitted inside tunnels, such as the one in this stock image, that detect bomb making chemicals in waste.

"A gay activist carrying a bag of Chick-fil-A items opened fire in the headquarters of a conservative lobbying unit, wounding a security guard, police said. At approximately 10.45 a.m. the man, identified as 28-year-old Floyd Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's (FRC) headquarters in Washington, DC's Chinatown area, made a statement, produced a gun and then shot a security guard who tried to stop him. Corkins had been volunteering at a community center dedicated to gay, lesbian and transgendered people. The guard was rushed to hospital while witnesses said that when the man was disarmed, the suspect said, 'Don't shoot me, it was not about you, it was what this place stands for.' Scroll down for video . Under arrest: Police say Floyd Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's headquarters in Washington, DC's Chinatown area with Chick-fil-A items and shot a guard . Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council August 15, 2012 in Washington, DC. David Mariner, the executive director of The DC Center for the LGBT Community, confirmed Corkins had been volunteering at the center for about the past 6 months. Mariner described Corkins as 'kind, gentle and unassuming.' While police have not yet stated what motivated Corkins, a coalition of 25 gay rights groups released a statement through GLAAD condemning the shooting. 'The motivation and circumstances behind today's tragedy are still unknown, but regardless of what emerges as the reason for this shooting, we utterly reject and condemn such violence. Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council August 15, 2012 in Washington, DC. 'We wish for a swift and complete recovery for the victim of this terrible incident,' the statement read.' The Family Research Council is a . right-wing, conservative lobbying organisation that is against abortion, . euthanasia and same-sex marriages. 'The . police are investigating this incident,' said FRC President Tony . Perkins in a statement. 'Our first concern is with our colleague who was . shot today. Our concern is for him and his family.' The council was also recently in the news when Mr. Perkins defended Chick-fil-A chief executive Dan Cathy's public comments that were perceived as critical of gay marriage. Cathy, the president of the . multimillion-dollar empire said in an interview with the conservative . paper Baptist Press last month that his company is ‘very much supportive . of the family,’ but only when it involves heterosexual couples.

Protests: Eduardo Cisneros, left, and Luke Montgomery, centre, kiss in front of a Chick-fil-A in Hollywood as Christian activist Alicia Daberkow, right, reads the bible in one of many demonstrations outside its restaurants . 'Well, guilty as charged,' Cathy . responded when asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife. His comments sparked outrage among gay and lesbian groups across the country, with many holding protests and 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A restaurants. Perkins later spoke out in support of Cathy, saying: 'All . Chick-fil-A did was refuse to be bullied by the politically correct . crowd.' Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council . The former president of the Family Research Council and former . Republican presidential candidate, Gary Bauer also said at the time: 'The values of the Family .

Anger: Protesters rally outside a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Little Rock, Arkansas . Sources have . told NBC 4's Jackie Bensen that the gunman had two 15 round ammunition . clips with him and was carrying Chick-fil-A sandwiches in his backpack . too. 'He opened fire on the security guard,' said MPD Police Chief Cathy Lanier. 'The . security guard was struck, is right now receiving treatment and is in . stable condition. The security guard and others wrestled the suspect . down to the ground and he is in custody.' It is thought that the security guard was shot in the arm and was conscious and breathing when he was taken to hospital. 'The security guard here is a hero, as far as I’m concerned,' said Chief Lanier. 'He did his job. The person never made it past the front.' According to Fox News, the suspect 'made statements regarding their policies and then opened fire with a gun striking a security guard.' As they began their investigation, federal authorities began treating the incident as a case of domestic terrorism. 'We don't know enough about him or . his circumstances to determine what his connection is to this group, . (The FRC) or his mental state, or what he was doing or thinking of . doing,' said James McJunkin, the head of the FBI's Washington Field . Office. Mitt Romney made a statement after hearing of the gunman entering the building.

'I am appalled by the shooting today at the offices of the Family Research Council in our nation’s capital,' he said. 'There . is no place for such violence in our society.

'So we're going to try to sort this all out, pull the evidence together, do all the interviews we can.' The shooting took place at the Family Research Council's 801 G Street headquarters and in the aftermath of the shooting the suspect was brought in by the FBI for questioning.

"Manuel Pellegrini has warned Chelsea to prepare for a ‘long five months’ in the Premier League title race if they want to depose Manchester City as champions. Jose Mourinho’s side moved three points clear at the top of the table with victory at Stoke on Monday night. However, City have twice won the title on the last day of the season in recent years and Pellegrini inists they will fight all the way again. ‘We are not thinking about Chelsea, we are just thinking about our team,’ said the Chilean. ‘We know it is important to have our own pressure. ‘You never win the title in December. We have a long five months to continue playing as well as we are doing so far, and we will see at the end of the season which team has most points.

After that, I think that is the same degree of difficulty one year as another.’ City go to West Brom on Boxing Day looking to extend their winning run to nine games in all competitions, and have not conceded a goal in four games despite losing captain Vincent Kompany to a hamstring injury. Pellegrini believes his team have overcome their stuttering start and rediscovered the form that saw them overhaul Liverpool in the title race last season. ‘We are playing now again with the intensity and in style of play we always do,’ he added. ‘We have again players in high level of performance and good moments. We are trusting in what we do so in the same way maybe we play in a poor way two months ago we are doing very well.

It gives a lot of trust also to our team.’ City at home to Burnley on Sunday and Pellegrini confirmed that Kompany and Stevan Jovetic could be fit by the end of the week. However, he added that strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko are unlikely to be available before the ‘second part of January’. ‘I think we need them as soon as we can,’ he said. ‘In this moment we are playing at a high level but we always need Aguero and all the other players that are injured to return. ‘When you come back from long injuries you always need some games to return to your normal performance. We have a squad for the whole year and we make some rotations.

Frank’s Lampard’s future is expected to be resolved in the ‘next days’, according to Pellegrini, with the former Chelsea favourite expected to stay at the Etihad for the rest of the season instead of joining up with their US affiliate club New York City. Pellegrini believes it is better for the organisation as a whole if Lampard delays his move to America. Asked if New York will be upset over the decision, he replied: ‘I don’t think so, that is why we have long conversations with all of them. That is just one club so I think that what is better for the club is better for all the clubs. ‘I said in the beginning it will be during December we are going to have the last decision.

"Missing millionaire Guma Aguiar left his wedding ring behind following a fight with his wife before  boarding his speedboat for trip that ended in his apparent death, it has been revealed. New evidence shows that Aguiar removed the band and his watch but took religious texts - which coast guards noted he did not usually carry - with him when he went for a ride on his 31-foot boat. The oil tycoon vanished on June 19 and is at the center of a controversy over whether he is really dead or faked his death to avoid losing his $100million fortune. His estate is now at the center of a legal battle between his wife and his mother, who believes he may still be alive. Happy times: Video released of missing Florida millionaire Guma Aguiar shows a calm, happy and smiling man sailing with his family on the same boat he went missing from on June 19 . 'I can only speculate that when he . left the house, he was upset and took things that gave him solace,' Aguiar's mother Ellen told the Sun-Sentinel. The Coast Guard logs, which were made public via a Freedom of Information Act request, included a partial note saying the mogul was 'not in a good frame of mind due to financial... [sic]' when he left his house on the evening of June 19. One of the other poignant notes in the files was 'Argument w/ wife over divorce… left watch, wedding ring'. Police warn that such personal details are not considered facts in the case, but were pieces of evidence compiled through various interviews during the Coast Guard's search for the missing man within the first 48 hours of his disappearance. One other fact noted in their findings was that all of the personal flotation devices typically stored on the boat were accounted for when the boat, named the T.T. Zion, was found having run aground on a Fort Lauderdale beach with the lights on and its engine on full throttle. Marital trouble: The coast guard's notes reveal that Guma Aguiar (right) had a fight with his wife Jamie (left) in the hours before he left the house on the night of his disappearance . The authorities focused largely on the . logistical evidence that they have to work with based on the GPS data . recorded by his boat before it crashed. It was barreling northeast around . 31mph for around half an hour before abruptly slowing down to about . 0.6mph and making an about-face, new GPS data show. The data, released by detectives after . they closed their active investigation, reveal Aguiar’s last journey . before his disappearance, showing that the boat the magnate was . driving never came to a complete stop, which has led officials to speculate . that he could have jumped onto another boat. According to ABC News, the GPS data . begins tracking Aguiar at 7.29pm after he had left the inlet by his . house. He travelled northeast for nearly 30 minutes at high speeds into . the open ocean. Tracking: This Google Earth view shows the path he took out into open water . Jumping ship? New GPS data shows Aguiar travelling northeast in the Atlantic Ocean for about half an hour before the boat abruptly switched directions and greatly decreasing speed . At 7.56pm, the 31-foot vessel suddenly made an ominously abrupt turn, slowing to speeds below 3mph. Certified marine surveyor Henry Pickersgill told MailOnline that Aguiar’s disappearance is still a mystery, though the GPS data does divulge several interesting bits of information. ‘There are some trends, there’s a pattern we can see with the boat,’ he said. ‘I think he got off. The path shows tracks north, some jags here or there, then there was an abrupt drop off in speed, according to the data. ‘The longitude on the data shows pretty static movement for about two minutes. There’s a drift pattern on the boat. And if he got off, that’s where he would have gotten off.’ The T.T. Zion, the boat that Guma Aguiar was thought to be piloting when he went missing is now being held at a police warehouse in Fort Lauderdale . Home . sweet home: The Fort Lauderdale house of Jamie and Guma Aguiar, which . Jamie wants to sell along with the couple's boat for $7.1 million . Guma and Jamie Aguiar's 77-foot Lazzara boat 'The Zion' which Jamie wants to sell for $2.1 million to re-adjust her and the couple's four children's lifestyle . Though Mr Pickersgill is not directly involved in the investigation, he called the millionaire’s path unusual, adding: ‘I don’t think it’s inconsistent with his profile. It’s a little bit unusual, but I don’t think it’s inconsistent with his profile. We’re looking to apply some good guesses to hard data.’ Fort Lauderdale police still do not suspect foul play, though facts revealed about Aguiar following his disappearance show he had had a difficult few months. In addition to battling with her son's wife for control of his estimated $100million fortune, Aguiar's mother hopes that her son may still be alive, wandering the streets of Fort Lauderdale after experiencing a nervous breakdown. In a petition filed to a Florida court to seize his $100million fortune, Ellen Aguiar stated that her son 'may be in a delusional state or be suffering from psychosis or otherwise may have disappeared.'","Oil tycoon Guma Aguiar went missing on June 19 .

"Russell Investments chief economist Mike Dueker was found dead Thursday, and police said it appeared he had taken his own life by jumping from a ramp near the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington State. His death is the latest in a series of untimely deaths among finance workers and business leaders around the world this past week. An officer who knew Dueker was missing in the area spotted the body about 8:30 a.m. at the base of a 40- to 50-foot embankment for a Highway 16 ramp, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. Suicide: Russell Investments¿ Chief Economist Mike Dueker was found dead in an apparent suicide in the United States, the latest in a series of untimely deaths among finance workers and business leaders around the world this past week . Dueker, 50, had been missing since January 29, and friends and law enforcement had been searching for him . Dueker's car was parked at nearby War Memorial Park and it appears he jumped over the 4-foot fence of a bike-jogging trail along the ramp, Troyer said. Police do not believe the death was an accident or that Dueker was a victim of a crime, Troyer said. Dueker, 50, of University Place, apparently died early Wednesday when his family thought he was out jogging. But he was not dressed for jogging and was wearing jeans and a sweater, Troyer said. His family had been looking for him. The body was hard to spot, Troyer said. Dueker had joined the financial services company in 2008. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Tice, said she couldn't speculate on any issues Dueker had. Career man: Dueker worked at Seattle-based Russell for five years, and developed a business-cycle index that forecast economic performance. He was previously an assistant vice president and research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis . 'We were deeply saddened to learn today of the death of our colleague and friend Mike Dueker. Mike was highly respected and regarded at Russell Investments and in the broader financial services industry. In the five years that he worked at Russell, he made valuable contributions that helped our clients and many of his fellow associates. Our thoughts are with Mike's family and friends during this difficult time,' Russell Investments said in a statement. As chief economist for Russell Investments, Dueker wrote for Russell's Market Outlook publications, forecasting the business cycle and the target federal funds rate. He developed and maintained a business cycle index published monthly on Russell.com. Well-respected: Dueker had published dozens of research papers over the past two decades, many on monetary policy, according to the St. Louis Fed¿s website, which ranks him among the top 5% of economists by number of works published . Dueker also led Russell's participation as one of 50 Blue Chip forecasters for both Blue Chip Economic Indicators and Blue Chip Financial Forecasts. The suicide in Washington follows a series of deaths among finance workers and business leaders this past week. Last Sunday, police in London found William Broeksmit, a 58-year-old former senior executive at Deutsche Bank AG, dead in his home after an apparent suicide, and on Tuesday, 39-year-old Gabriel Magee, a JP Morgan employee, died after falling from the roof of its the European headquarters of JP Morgan in London. Mr Magee's parents have today told of their grief of their son who had worked as Vice President in the technology department for six years. He was said to be in a happy relationship with a long-term girlfriend. His parents, Bill, 64, and Nell, 74, Magee are now demanding answers to how he could have got up on to the roof of the building in Canary Wharf before he fell 500ft on Tuesday morning. 'We are shattered beyond words. This was a young man, we cherished him,' said Mrs Magee, 74. 'He was named after the angel Gabriel, the messenger who always had good news. He always brought us good news.' She said: 'I’ve spoken to the embassy, the police. I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened. 'How was he able to get up there. There was no reason for him to be up on that roof.' The executive had recently agreed with his bosses that he could work four days a week instead of five and was thought to be planning a family with his partner. His father, a former US military pilot, last spoke to his son a fortnight ago and said that he seemed content. 'It was very comforting to see him in a relationship that he thought had longevity,' he said. Mr and Mrs Magee will be travelling to London in the coming days. Tragic: The parents of Gabriel Magee are demanding answers after he jumped from the top of JP Morgan's headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, to his death yesterday . Mrs Nell revealed that Gabriel was in a long term relationship with his girlfriend Veronica, whose family are from San Diego, and that they were planning a family together. Her son was also a talented musician and loved playing his guitar. Nell said: 'I want to know why JP Morgan has not had the decency to call me. I’ve spoken to the embassy, the coroner, the police. Nell said that as far as she knew Gabriel was 'a happy person who was happy with his life'. He and Veronica were not engaged but 'had an understanding' and were going to spend the rest of their lives together. Nell said: 'There was no reason for him to up on that roof'. Furious: The Magees said they would be demanding answers from JP Morgan, revealing that nobody from the company had 'had the decency' to call them after their son Gabriel plunged to his death . Gabriel's parents revealed that he had recently started working four days a week instead of five, a deal his bosses were happy with. His body was found on the ninth floor roof of the JP Morgan office, which serves as its European HQ. He was named in an email sent to all JP Morgan staff Tuesday afternoon. A company spokesman said: 'We are deeply saddened to have lost a member of the J.P. Morgan family at 25 Bank Street today. Our thoughts and sympathy are with his family and his friends'. A source close to Gabriel said he was in 'good standing with his bosses and colleagues. He was well liked.' Investigation: Scotland Yard said they were called to 25 Bank Street at 8.02 a.m. yesterday and detectives were not treating Gabriel Magee's death as suspicious . Scene: Gabriel Magee, who'd worked for the company for nearly two decades,  fell from the top of the 33-storey JP Morgan skyscraper shortly after 8am on Tuesday . On Sunday, former Deutsche Bank senior manager, William 'Bill' Broeksmit, 58, was found hanging in his home in South Kensington .

"He divides opinion, but that's what makes Zlatan, Zlatan. Love him, loathe him; you cannot escape him. But how has this bona-fide world superstar evolved over the years? You first impression of Ibrahimovic is that he's an egotist. Hugely self-confident, in similar realms to fellow Scandinavian Nicklas Bendtner, only with the ability to back-up his big talk. Zlatan Ibrahimovic trains alongside PSG team-mates Thiago Silva, Adrien Rabiot and Lucas Digne . Ibrahimovic prepares to face former manager Jose Mourinho and Chelsea . Ibrahimovic celebrated his goal against Caen at the weekend by showing off his many tattoos . You only need to Google 'best ever Ibrahimovic quotes' for a sense of how highly the Swede rates himself. Here are three highlights: . 1. 'In my head I am the strongest of all. I certainly don't need the Ballon d'Or to prove that I am number one.' - Ibrahimovich's views after failing to make the shortlist for the 2012 award. 2. 'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.' The striker's views after Sweden missed out on qualifying for World Cup 2014. 3. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was like ""No way, Zlatan doesn’t do auditions"".' - Revealing why he turned down a trial at Arsenal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates his goal as Sweden beat England in November 2012 . Ibrahimovic scored a spectacular propeller kick for Sweden against England . At the age of 33, his cockiness hasn't waned. He knows he's good, and isn't afraid to tell people. Perhaps that's why he has such a close bond with Jose Mourinho. They're like two peas in pod. Like, the Special One, the Paris St Germain striker is box office. But, on these shores at least, Ibrahimovic's talents have always been under scrutiny somewhat. We know the potential is there - but his poor record against English clubs has always left some unanswered questions. Of course, scoring against English opposition isn't the be all and end all of what makes a successful footballer - to suggest so would be nonsensical. Ibrahimovic celebrates scoring for AC Milan against Arsenal in 2012 . Ibrahimovic has scored three goals against Arsenal - the only English side he has scored against . Ibrahimovic first came up against Arsenal back in 2006 while playing for Juventus . But for those who do not follow the European leagues would have found it hard to give credence to Ibrahimovic's reputation having not seen first-hand evidence. In 16 games against English opposition, Ibrahimovic has found the back of net just three times - all of them against Arsenal in the Champions League. But then came November 14, 2012. England, who brought them a largely experimental squad, travelled to Stockholm for a friendly. What followed was a Zlatan master class. Four goals - including one outrageous 30-yard propeller kick. Ibrahimovic played in the first leg against Chelsea in the Champions League last season . Ibrahimovic picked up an injury in the first leg against Chelsea last season and missed the second leg . If the preceding hat-trick wasn't enough to convince the most staunch Ibrahimovic sceptics, then THAT goal would have won them over. If an Englishman even questioned his top-level credentials, Ibrahimovic has his defence ready to go. Indeed, that strike has certainly changed the perception of the Super Swede in England. There's nothing we hate more than a loudmouth who cannot justify his words. Now, in Ibrahimovic, we see a man that can. His record against English clubs still leaves a lot to be desired, however. He drew another blank against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final last season, but he missed the second leg at Stamford Bridge with a hamstring injury. Ibrahimovic failed to score in two games against Tottenham back in 2011 . The striker will have another opportunity to improve his record against Premier League opposition tonight when PSG welcome the Blues to the Parc de Prince. In addition to his lack of goals, the former Barcelona striker has only once finished on the winning team against an English club: in AC Milan's 4-0 win over Arsenal in 2012. That won't be of any comfort to Mourinho, though. He knows Ibra's capabilities. So does Ibra, of course.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored three goals against English clubs .

There were a number of police vans located around - with certain areas cordoned off . Gary Cahill and Didier Drogba were among some of the other names pictured outside the Collectionneur hotel . Edinson Cavani and Javier Pastore were both on target as the hosts ran out convincing 3-1 winners in the first leg against Mourinho's men, before the Blues pegged back the French side in the concluding leg with a 2-0 victory - progressing through to the semi-finals by virtue of away goals. Ahead of the mouth-watering clash with the French Champions, Mourinho has 17-goal Diego Costa available for selection following a three-match ban - although the 52-year-old is not convinced the 26-year-old will be firing on all cylinders on Tuesday night. Ahead of the match Mourinho said on Costa's return: 'A long rest is not good for him. I don't think it's good for him or any player. www.squawka.com . Paco Biosca (far right) - Chelsea's medical director - was among the senior figures pictured on Tuesday . Mourinho believes Diego Costa will not be at his best against PSG following a three-match ban . 'A little rest is welcome for everyone; a big rest isn't good for the players. 'So we are not going to see the best Diego. I hope I'm wrong, but probably he will need this game to try and get it.' Both sides go into the game with plenty of confidence, with Chelsea seven points clear at the top of the Premier League and still on the hunt for a historic treble, while PSG are searching a third successive Ligue 1 triumph this term, currently sitting just two points off the leaders Lyon.","Chelsea take on PSG at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday night .

"Lazar Markovic has been handed a four-game ban for his red card in December's Champions League group clash with Basle at Anfield. The Liverpool winger was set to discover the length of his European suspension for the incident, in which his outstretched hand touched the face of Behrang Safari, after UEFA's disciplinary committee meet on Thursday. But Markovic hinted he had already discovered his fate and appeared to express his shock at the harsh punishment when he tweeted '4?' on Tuesday. The message was accompanied by a picture of HIM looking bemused during a Liverpool match. Lazar Markovic pushes out his arm towards Behrang Safari's face in the clash with Basle in December . Players crowd around Safari as he stays down after his clash with Markovic in the Champions League game . UEFA have the £20million Serbian winger down for a four-match suspension on official lists. Markovic, 20, had only been on the pitch for 15 minutes when he was sent off against Basle. He has been given an extra game on top of the normal three-match ban for violent conduct because he was sent off playing for Benfica in a Europa League match last May. Markovic had already been substituted in the Europa League semi-final against Juventus but was sent off by Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg for his part in a touchline fracas. The red card meant he missed the final against Sevilla, which the Spanish side won on penalties. Referee Bjorn Kuipers shows the Serb a red card, and Markovic looks to have been banned for four games . The £20million winger played 45 minutes of Liverpool's FA Cup game at Crystal Palace on Saturday evening . UEFA's discipliary list shows Markovic has been given a four-game suspension . Liverpool opted not to appeal UEFA's decision and Markovic will miss both legs of the last-32 Europa League clash against Besiktas, the first of which is at Anfield on Thursday, as well as the home and away last-16 matches should they progress. Markovic's dismissal against Basle was one element of a thoroughly disappointing night for the club, with a 1-1 draw not enough to see them progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League. Manager Brendan Rodgers was unhappy with the red card, saying after the match: 'I thought the sending off was a really disappointing decision by the referee. 'Lazar Markovic gets sent off for that - his fingernail barely touches the nose of the defender and the defender is the guy who should be looked at for his reaction.'","Lazar Markovic was sent off for Liverpool against Basle in December .

"Finally safe: Pickles has been reunited with dog has been reunited with owners Harris Brunning, 14, and Eden Brunning, 12 after spending an incredible ten days trapped in an underground pipe . A lucky dog has been reunited with her owners after spending an incredible ten days trapped in an underground pipe. Pickles, a seven-year-old terrier,  only escaped because she lost so much weight she could wriggle out back out of the pipe. She disappeared into the 8cm-wide tunnel while being walked on farmland near her home in Market Harborough, Leics. Firefighters and rescue experts were called in and used infra-red cameras and hi-tech audio equipment - normally used for finding earthquake survivors buried under rubble - to try to locate the beloved pet. But after hours of digging and searching they  found no evidence that Pickles was still alive and were forced to call off the rescue - to the agony of owner Kirsty Brunning and her children Harris, 14, and 12-year-old Eden. However, the plucky animal eventually managed to escape on her own, and was spotted by a passing motorist close to where she went missing. He alerted the delighted family, who went to retrieve her. It is thought she lost enough weight during her ten-day ordeal to be able to crawl through 300m (984ft) of pipe and finally wriggle free. Ms Brunning, 42, said: 'It was awful when they said they was nothing else they could do. 'We’d read that dogs could survive for a long time underground, but we didn’t find anything. 'The kids were pretty upset and we had to explain to them that she may not come home and told them to be brave about it.' Ms Brunning's son, Harris, said: 'The man who spotted Pickles came round and was shouting, ‘Get your shoes on, I’ve found her’. Missing: Pickles, a seven-year-old terrier, disappeared into the 8cm-wide pipe while being walked on farmland near her home . 'It was really amazing because we didn’t think she was coming home again - after 10 days I’d sort of given up. 'When I saw her again, I gave her a big hug - I was so happy.' His sister, Eden, said: 'She’s like a . miracle dog, she had a few scratches on her face and she looks like . she’s been through the wars, but she’s back home now - safe and sound.' Ms Brunning added: 'I was shocked, I couldn’t believe it. 'She . was very thin and very dirty and the fur on her hips had rubbed off . where she must have been trapped. She was very wobbly on her feet, too.' Frantic search: RSPCA collection officer Sharon Knight near to the pipe Pickles climbed in to - she was dehydrated and is now on a high protein diet to build her weight back up - but is otherwise unharmed . 'We all had tears in our eyes when we got her home, we were so happy to have her back. 'I honestly can’t believe it. After ten days we just thought there was no chance she would be alive. It is just amazing.' Pickles was dehydrated and is now on a high protein diet to build her weight back up - but is otherwise unharmed. Firefighter Andy Blyth, who was in charge of the rescue, said: 'It’s marvellous news, although ten days is a long time to be trapped. 'We usually hear of dogs being underground for two or three days - but this is amazing, I don’t know how she did it.'","Rescue experts were called in and used infra-red cameras and hi-tech audio equipment to try to locate Pickles, but found no sign of life .

"Chelsea travel to PSG in the Champions League last-16 first leg at Parc de Princes on Tuesday night knowing that the biggest threat to their progress is talismanic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Sweden international is no stranger to the extraordinary and his career - spanning 16 years and seven clubs, including spells at AC MIlan, Barcelona and Juventus - is littered with ridiculous and sublime goals. Here, Sportsmail reminds you of ten of Ibrahimovic's best strikes. Zlatan Ibrahimovic jumps for joy after scoring arguably his best goal against England at Wembley . The Sweden international has enjoyed huge success at a number of top clubs, including Inter Milan . AJAX vs NAC Breda, 2004-05 . Ibrahimovic made a name for himself as a scorer of great goals during his three-year spell with Dutch giants Ajax, and they don't get much better than this. The striker showed his power and skill in equal measure as he danced through the NAC backline embarrassing several defenders and the goalkeeper on his way to slotting home. Roma vs JUVENTUS, 2005-06 . Ibrahimovic's exploits at Ajax soon led to Europe's elite casting their eye on the unpredictable striker, who made a big-money move to Italian heavyweights Juventus. In his first season at the club Ibrahimovic scored 16 league goals including this beauty against Roma. The striker produced a brilliant improvised flick before bullying the defender with brute strength and firing past the keeper with the outside of his boot. Benfica vs JUVENTUS, 2005-06 . During the same season Ibrahimovic scored this absolute worldy against Benfica in the Champions League when he latched on to nothing more than a hopeful punt up field. The forward out-muscles his opponent before spinning in behind and unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 yards with his, supposedly, weaker left foot that ends with both the ball and the keeper in the back of the net. INTER vs Bologna, 2008-09 . After two successful seasons at Juventus the club were relegated to Serie B following the uncovering of the Calciopoli scandal and while several big-name players remained at the, the Italian second tier wasn't for Zlatan. He moved to Inter and continued where he left off adding this wonderful near-post back heel volley to his burgeoning collection of stunning goals. INTER vs Atalanta, 2008-09 . Ibrahimovic again turned to the unorthodox method of using the back of his foot as he scored the winner in a seven-goal thriller against Atalanta. The chance appeared to be gone but as Ibrahimovic stumbled under the challenge of a defender, with his back to goal, he swung his heel back and stunned the goalkeeper, who remained rooted to the spot. INTER vs Fiorentina, 2008-09 . Ibrahimovic has scored a number of brilliant free kicks during his career, but this one makes the selection for its sheer power and accuracy. The striker placed the ball a full 40 yards from goal and struck it with such power that it was past the keeper in a heartbeat. The bend on the ball and the fact it cannoned in off the crossbar only add to the spectacle. Lecce vs AC MILAN 2010-11 . Not too dissimilar to his earlier goal against Benfica for Juventus, the then AC Milan striker created a stunning goal out of absolutely nothing. Ibrahimovic raced on to a clearance, bursting past one defender with great pace, before barging another out the way and finally sending a controlled lobbed volley over the goalkeeper, who was no more than three yards off his line. SWEDEN vs France, 2012 . During the 2012 European Championships Ibrahimovic scored another technically brilliant goal as Sweden beat France 2-0, and even helped England top Group D. A hopeful cross from the Sweden right arrived to Ibrahimovic just inside the penalty area and the striker acrobatically connected with a flying volley that flew past Hugo Lloris. England vs SWEDEN, 2012-13 . Arguably Ibrahimovic's best goal came against England at Wembley. It may have only been a friendly but the Sweden international won the 2013 FIFA Puskas Award with this over-head kick from the best part of 35 yards. Granted, he had a little help from Joe Hart, who rushed out of his area only to head the ball about 10 yards clear, but take nothing away from the finish as Ibrahimovic instinctively reacted by acrobatically sending it back towards the goal with a flying propeller kick. Marseilles vs PSG, 2012-13 . Finally, it's another one from Ibrahimovic's collection of unorthodox volleys, this time for current club PSG during a Ligue 1 clash against Marseilles. A corner is swung into the box and Ibrahimovic holds off the defender and shows remarkable control to flick the ball past the keeper with an incredible amount of power and accuracy.","PSG host Chelsea in the Champions League last-16 on Tuesday night .

"The 557ft luxury yacht owned by Russian oligarch and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich has been docked in Germany in order to undergo renovations. Pictured at Hamburg's Blohm Voss shipbuilders where it was originally built in 2010 and 2011, the ship has been placed into a dry dock where workers have been carrying out work on various levels of the ship. The Russian oligarch's lavish boat - named Eclipse - boasts a stunning array of high-tech gadgetry alongside the opulence which is commonly seen in billionaires' superyachts. All of this begs the question - what exactly needs renovating? Scroll down for video . Roman Abramovich's £1.5billion superyacht Eclipse is pictured in dry dock in Germany where it is undergoing renovations . The mega-yacht is undergoing repairs at the German shipyard where it was built by Blohm Voss at a cost that was close to £1.5billion . For a time, Eclipse (pictured) held the title of the world's largest superyacht, but it has since been surpassed by the 590ft Azzam . For a time, the boat held the title of the world's largest superyacht, but has since been surpassed by the 590ft Azzam, which is believed to be owned by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates. However, both are so large they have trouble fitting into the majority of the world's marinas. Mr Abramovich's Eclipse is 536ft long and 72.2ft wide, and has an estimated gross tonnage of 13,500GT. She has four diesel engines and a maximum speed of 22 knots, although this speed is well surpassed by some of the newer superyacht builds. It can accommodate 36 guests in comfort, and boasts a cinema, conference facilities, children's playroom, beauty salon, dance floor, swimming pool and sauna. Built by Blohm Voss Shipyards and designed inside and out by Terence Disdale, Eclipse was custom-made for the Chelsea oligarch in 2010. The incredible vessel also contains two swimming pools, two helicopter pads, a dedicated disco hall, around 30 cabins, a mini-submarine, and even a missile defence system. Luxury lifestyle: Mr Abramovich is pictured relaxing on the yacht with several friends in this file photograph . Exactly what part of the yacht is being renovated is unclear, but is it is already equipped with a submarine, two swimming pools, and more than 30 bedrooms . A small ferry motors past the massive yacht in dry dock, which was the largest yacht in the world until it was surpassed two years ago . Built by Blohm Voss Shipyards and designed inside and out by Terence Disdale, Eclipse was custom-made for Mr Abramovich in 2010 . It has armour-plating around Mr Abramovich’s master suite, bullet-proof windows and a laser system designed to dazzle long-lens photographers. When it was ordered, the initial cost was estimated at around $500million, but by the time Mr Abramovich took delivery in 2012 it was spiralling towards the $1.5billion mark because of the extra luxury fittings and security measures. The oligarch also owns three other mega-yachts, the Pelorus (377ft), the Ecstasea (282ft) and the Sussurro (161ft). Mr Abramovich once lent the Pelorus to Chelsea footballers Frank Lampard and John Terry as a 'bonus' for playing well and annual running costs for his fleet are around $25million including full tanks of petrol at around $110,000 per yacht.

"Frank McParland is enjoying his new role as director of football at Brentford . 'I always used to say to the kids at the academy ''everyone leaves Liverpool at some stage in their life, just try and stay here as long as you can''. I hadn't anticipated applying it to myself.' Frank McParland had been at Liverpool, on and off, for 20 years. He was the man who pushed to sign Raheem Sterling. He had been their chief scout under Rafa Benitez and director of their academy then, a year ago, chief executive Ian Ayre broke the news the club had decided to move in another direction. He was sacked. Now director of football at Championship side Brentford, the pain has subsided sufficiently for him to reflect on the moment more philosophically. 'Football clubs don't stand still, there's always change and you can't always control it,' he reasons. 'I'm a Liverpool fan so it hurt, I loved every day I went to work there, made some great friends and we had a great family atmosphere around the place. I've got great affection for the club and I keep in touch with Brendan Rodgers, Ian Ayre, Raheem and Steven Gerrard. Although I left, they still treated me with the utmost respect and as they say, when one door closes another opens.' McParland went on holiday to Tenerife for five days to contemplate his future. It rained for four of them. 'I was miserable, then out of the blue I got a call from Matthew Benham, the owner of Brentford, who said he wanted to meet for dinner with Uwe Rosler and the director of football Mark Warburton to discuss a few ideas. I'd had an offer from Norway and one from New York Cosmos but I was intrigued.' By the time dinner came round though, Rosler had informed Brentford that he wanted to take the manager's job at Wigan and Benham did not stand in the German's way. McParland works with manager Mark Warburton and coach David Weir . McParland was asked to take Warburton's role as director of football and Warburton become manager. McParland agreed, even offering to walk away at the end of the season if it didn't work out. Brentford were fourth when McParland joined and started with a 1-0 win at Oldham, secured in the 93rd minute. The next stage was the appointment of coach David Weir, the ex-Everton and Rangers captain, who had had a brief spell managing Sheffield United. 'Davie's a great coach with good ideas and he shared our vision. He was very unfortunate at Sheffield United but he showed there the style he wanted to play and that was similar to what Mark and myself wanted.' Weir and McParland moved in together, sharing an apartment in Ealing; 'we were like the Odd Couple,' says McParland. 'One staunch Everton, one staunch Liverpool. It was an interesting experience.' McParland enjoys night matches at Griffin Park and is looking forward to Friday's derby with Fulham . Five months later they clinched promotion to the Championship for the first time in 21 years and, going into Friday's derby with west London rivals Fulham, sit sixth in the table. Although managers such as Harry Redknapp contend they could not work with a director of football, McParland has faith in Brentford's system. 'The whole experience has been a breath of fresh air,' says McParland. 'We have a really open relationship. Matthew, the owner, believes that everyone should be able to say what they think to each other and we do. 'It can't work if, as is the case at some clubs, the manager doesn't agree on the players you sign or a committee decides. We all have to agree and if one of us doesn't then we don't do it. McParland is the impressed with Brentford owner Matthew Benham and his vision for the club . 'Mark is one of the hardest workers I've come across. He's always the first one in and last one out and he lives nearly a two hour drive away, you know what London traffic is like! Davie likes to try and beat him in of a morning but even when he's got there at 7am, 'Warbs' is in with a coffee on the go. 'Mark is a visionary. He gives the players such confidence, he doesn't blame them, he doesn't lambast them over mistakes. There's a structure to what he does and the football is attractive.' That is only fitting as legend has it football began in Brentford when Julius Caesar kicked the skull of a vanquished Briton across the River Brent in 54 BC. Brentford have had an excellent start to the season and are in the top six of the Championship . 'A couple of old guys came up to me recently and said this was the best football they had seen here,' says McParland. 'I don't think they were around for Julius Caesar's debut but they'd been coming here for 60 years.' However, Griffin Park, Brentford's home since 1904, will not be for much longer. Benham has a new stadium schemed for nearby Kew in 2017/18. 'Matthew made a bold decision,' says McParland. 'It would have been cheaper to move farther away but he found the site at Kew and it's important for the fans to keep that identity with the area. I'll be sorry to leave Griffin Park though because on a night game, like the one coming up on Friday, we'll have a cracking atmosphere and the place will be rocking. 'The plan is keep building and nurturing to give the fans something to shout about when we move too. We're all dreaming of going up, it might not be realistic just yet but, as I've found out, you just never know what's round the corner.'","Frank McParland was sacked by Liverpool last year after 20 years .

"Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown may have been slightly premature when he queried whether Radamel Falcao's lifeless outing at Deepdale on Monday night could have been his last in a Manchester United shirt. The misfiring Colombian is on loan at Old Trafford for the rest of the season, and United have a £43million option to make the deal permanent. But here are 10 reasons why they should not. Radamel Falcao was hauled off on the hour mark after yet another poor display for Manchester United . Falcao, pictured with Wayne Rooney on Monday night, has managed only four goals form 19 matches . It was another disappointing night for Falcao as he failed to complete the 90 minutes against Preston . Because he is not worth it... When you pay £6m to loan someone and then stump up £285,000-a-week in wages you expect something substantial in return. That has simply not happened. Even given United's spending power and windfalls from the adidas partnership and new TV deal this is a player who, so far, has not done anything to show why they should splash out £43m to secure his services permanently. Falcao is replaced by Ashley Young with United losing 1-0. They went on to win the fifth-round tie 3-1 . Lies, damn lies and statistics... A Scots poet once said that statistics are used like a drunk uses a lamppost – for support and not illumination. However, they present a compelling case when it comes to the Colombian. With a paltry four goals in 19 games, Falcao has completed 90 minutes on a mere five occasions. At Deepdale, an hour yielded no shots on or off target, no assists and the grand total of 18 passes. The Colombian international made his way to the touchline once he realised his number was being held up . That miss against West Ham... Falcao can justifiably point to a lack of chances during his stint in a United shirt. The free-flowing red marauders of recent years now seem a distant memory as Louis van Gaal's men struggle to create openings. However, at Upton Park he was given a glorious opportunity. Clean through and with only the keeper to beat Falcao failed to control and prodded a tame volley wide. It was the kind of opportunity you would have expected him to relish and summed up a miserable season. Falcao spurned a brilliant chance against West Ham which summed up his disappointing season at United . Powerless at Preston... You would have thought Falcao, a man who has shone on the biggest stages, would have been licking his lips at a trip to a League One side. Not so much. Over the course of a difficult hour he failed to trouble an admittedly hard-working and physical third-tier backline and it surprised nobody apart from himself when he was hooked to gleeful cries of 'What a waste of money' from the home support. Impact on the rest of the team... It is just not working. Look at Monday night. After 60 minutes United were a goal down and heading for their earliest end to a hunt for honours in a season for 28 years. One-paced and one-dimensional, they were playing into burly Preston's hands. Off came Falcao, replaced by Ashley Young, and almost immediately they were playing with width and pace on their way to scoring three goals. This was not the first time Falcao's withdrawal has had a positive impact - something that will not have bypassed the meticulous Van Gaal. Ashley Young celebrates with Marouane Fellaini after the big Belgian fired United into the lead at Preston . Fellaini struck in the second half as Man United completed their comeback against the League One side . Injury doubts persist... This, simply put, is not the same player as the goal machine who succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury last January. He is not sharp and still seems desperately short of match fitness. Falcao has now made 19 appearances for United - will he will ever regain the sharpness that made him one of European football's hottest properties? Jorge 'mouth' Mendes... The so-called super agent is an influential man and one who has a longstanding relationship with United. But when he starts criticising the manager you have to wonder if he needs reminding of who pays the bills. Earlier this month Mendes made the bold claim that Falcao would be firing at United if Sir Alex Ferguson was still manager. With that latest attack he may have sealed his client's fate. Agent Jorge Mendes appeared to suggest that Falcao would have had more success with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson rather than under the current regime of Louis van Gaal . Not what United need... Van Gaal's relatively late arrival at Old Trafford meant that, for the second summer in a row, there was a lack of proper planning behind the club's moves in the transfer window. As a result, the Dutchman appears to have ended up with pieces from separate jigsaws. He knows that United need pace up front – that's why he's started untested rookie James Wilson ahead of Falcao more than once. With targets already identified for this summer United will not make the same mistakes twice. Falcao, pictured here during his side's 0-0 draw at Cambridge, appears to be short on confidence . Confidence issues... When you own a gold-plated mobile phone, pick up £285,000-a-week and have God-like status in your homeland you would imagine confidence is not an issue. But for Falcao it clearly is. The pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world coupled with the feeling that this season is a test created by the £43m clause appear to be weighing heavily on his shoulders. A striker without confidence is a striker without goals. Old father time... Van Gaal has always been a fan of promoting youth, something he did to great effect at Ajax. Falcao turned 29 earlier this month. If the deal was to be made permanent he would be looking for at least a three-year agreement which would take him to 32. United have moved away from their policy of not signing players without a resale value recently but in this case Falcao's age as well as his form is likely to count against him.","Radamel Falcao is on loan at Manchester United for the rest of the season .

"Egypt has taken the unusual step of urging the U.S. to exercise restraint in dealing with racially charged demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri. Echoing language Washington used to caution the Cairo government as it cracked down on Islamist protesters last year, Egypt's Foreign Ministry said it was 'closely following' the escalation of violent protests following the shooting dead by police of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. It is highly unusual for Egypt to criticise . such a major donor, and it was not immediately clear why the government . would have taken such a step at this stage. The development came as ISIS militants used social media to encourage protesters in Ferguson to embrace radical Islam and fight against the U.S. government. Tense: Police attempt to control demonstrators protesting in Ferguson, Missouri last night. Officers shot smoke and tear gas in to the crowd in order to disperse furious demonstrators after they became unruly . Resembling a war zone: Heavily armed police attempt to control demonstrators protesting the killing of teenager Michael Brown . Making a statement: Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (left) has taken the unusual step of urging the U.S. Preisdent Barack Obama (right) to exercise restraint in dealing with demonstrations in Ferguson . Ties between Washington and Cairo were strained after Egyptian security forces killed hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters following the army's ousting of freely elected President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. Western allies have voiced concern about the democratic credentials of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief who toppled Mursi and went on to win elections. The United States has, however, continued to provide military and other support to Cairo. In a statement released today, however, Egypt's Foreign Ministry's urged the U.S. government to exercise restraint when dealing with the Ferguson protesters. The wording of the statement read similarly to a message issued by Barack Obama's administration in July 2013, when the White House 'urged security forces to exercise maximum restraint and caution' in dealing with demonstrations by Morsi supporters. Turn of events: Echoing language Washington used to caution the Cairo government as it cracked down on Islamist protesters last year (pictured) Comparison: A member of the Egyptian security forces speaks to a woman holding a stick as he helps clear a sit-in by supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi amid protests in Cairo last year .

Anger: A demonstrator reacts during a protest on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson after police fired tear gas in his direction . Egypt today said it was 'closely following the escalation of protests' in Ferguson, which began after the fatal shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager Michael Brown by white policeman Darren Wilson, 28, on August 9. Nine days of violent protests have since taken place, with demonstrators shooting at police at officers criticised for a 'heavy handed' effort to disperse the crowds. Human . Rights Watch said in a report last week that Egyptian security forces . systematically used excessive force against Islamist protesters after . Morsi was ousted in 2013. Egypt said the report was 'characterised by negativity and bias'. Violence: The jihadists and their sympathisers in the West have taken to Twitter to send messages of support to hundreds of demonstrators taking part in a ninth night of angry protests in Ferguson (pictured) A lone man walks in front of police lines in Ferguson as 31 people are reported to have been arrested . Demonstrators have once again taken to the streets of Ferguson with their faces covered to protect against tear gas attacks by police . News of Egypt's intervention in the protests come as ISIS militants and their supporters used social media to encourage demonstrators to embrace radical Islam and fight against the U.S. government. Jihadists in Syria and Iraq and their sympathisers in the West have taken to Twitter to send messages of support to hundreds of demonstrators taking part in a ninth night of angry protests. The militants' tweets denounce local officers for the way they have attempted to quell the violence, make reference to historic acts of police brutality, and even use the hashtag #FergusonUnderISIS in an attempt to get angry young men in the city to declare allegiance to the Islamist group. Additionally, footage purportedly taken from the scene of the Ferguson protests appeared to show one demonstrator marching along a street holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here'. 'Chilling': Footage purportedly from a CNN live stream of the protests appeared to show one young demonstrator marching along a street holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here' Salena Zito - a political columnist for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper - described as 'chilling' the footage of a Ferguson demonstrator purportedly holding an ISIS banner while standing behind a CNN reporter . One ISIS sympathiser calling himself Mujahid Miski, who claims to be from Minneapolis–Saint Paul but suggests he is now based in 'the horn of Africa', has led the campaign to encourage those taking part in the protests to embrace radical Islam. In one message he tweets: 'So how is democracy treating you guys? #FergusonUnderIS #Ferguson. He adds: 'I thought u guys back in #Ferguson were supposed to be Free & that u had equal rights. I'd really like to know what changed? #FergusonUnderIS'. Miski goes on to retweet dozens of messages by a Twitter user with the handle @AmreekiWitness, who claims to monitor and support the growth of radical Islam in the U.S.. Threat: One Twitter user with the handle @AmreekiWitness, who claims to monitor the growth of radical Islam in the U.S., has led the calls for Ferguson protesters to embrace ISIS' brutal branch of radical Islam . Encouragement: Amreeki Witness' Twitter messages focus on the treatment of black people in the U.S. and urge angry young black men to take up Islamic extremism . Amreeki Witness' messages focus on the treatment of black people in the U.S., praise Malcolm X for embracing Islam and urge angry young black men to take up the religion as it means the police 'will fear you'. In one message Amreeki Witness mocks the curfew police have imposed in Ferguson to bring an end to the disorder, saying: 'We IS guys hate you for your freedom, eh? Just like that freedom uplifting curfew in #Ferguson? Wake up, or they'll never let you outside.' As the social media campaign began to take hold, with dozens of radical Islamists commenting on the Ferguson protests, Amreeki Witness tweeted: 'May be time to organize the Muslims in America upon haqq and mobilize to #Ferguson. Defend the oppressed, start jihad here.' The message attracted a large response, with one Islamist calling himself Amarka Al-Ahlam responding: 'Preach, brother. We must organize brigades in preparation for the oncoming storm. #FergusonUnderIS #JihadinFerguson.' New cause: As the social media campaign began to take hold, dozens of radical Islamists began commenting on the Ferguson protests . Ambition: This Twitter user appears to explain the reason ISIS sympathisers are attempting to hijack the Ferguson protest is because the militant group hope it will allow them to take control of the city . Amreeki Witness added: 'They cower in fear of us whilst they massacre and oppress you! It's time to strike fear into the hearts of the oppressors. #FergusonUnderIS'. News of the militants' campaign to encourage Ferguson demonstrators to embrace radical Islamism comes as footage purportedly from a CNN live stream of the protests appeared to show one young man holding a sign reading 'ISIS is here.' It is not known whether the banner - footage of which has not yet been independently verified - was in support of the militant group or, as seems more likely, it was an attempt to compare ISIS to the local police force or the U.S. government. Nevertheless stills of the alleged CNN footage were embraced by jihadists who have claimed they prove jihadists are already playing their part in the protests. Worrying: One ISIS sympathiser calling himself Mujahid Miski, who claims to be from Minneapolis-Saint Paul but suggests he is now based in 'the horn of Africa', has led the campaign to encourage those taking part in the protests to embrace radical Islam . Chilling images of the alleged ISIS banner being carried by demonstrators have been widely shared by ISIS sympathisers on social media, who have used them to encourage supporters based in America to travel to Ferguson to further stoke the violence in the city. News of ISIS' attempt to hijack the Ferguson protests come as Palestinian Twitter users sent messages of support to the demonstrators and gave advice on the best way to cope with the tear gas police are using to disperse crowds. As images emerged of heavily armed police and armoured tanks on the streets of nearby St Louis, many Palestinian Twitter users expressed their solidarity with demonstrators. The messages of support from Palestinians come amid reports that many of the Ferguson protesters were heard chanting 'Gaza Strip' as they marched through the heart of the city.","Egypt says it will be 'closely following' escalating race riots in Ferguson .

"A new website has launched for a growing trend of singletons seeking 'part time relationships'. Started by journalist Helen Croydon, partimelove.co.uk is designed for those who still want some intimacy and romance in their lives, but not the time commitment a normal relationship demands. The website states it is perfect for 'singles looking for . regular partners with mutual attraction, genuine friendship, respect and . a magical spark but whom have no expectations of moving in after three . months and value their free time and independence.' The dating website is for those seeking a meaningful relationship without full-time commitment . The dating site aims to cater for those who want a real relationship - as opposed to gratuitous sexual encounters - but who only want to invest limited amounts of time to it. Appealing to potential clientele, the website states: 'Perhaps you are just out of a long-term relationship and want to take things slow? Maybe you are a single parent, you travel three days every week or perhaps you are focused on a new career goal and don't have time for a conventional all-consuming relationship. 'That shouldn't mean you have to settle for meaningless flings. Members of parttimelove.co.uk are all like-minded single people who value their existing lifestyle but still want to spend quality time with someone they care about.' Joining the website is free of charge and you can chose whether you are 'a man seeking a woman', or a 'woman seeking a man.' The Part Time Love website was created by Helen Croydon who also writes about the benefits of what she calls the 'low maintenance relationship' in her latest book . And it seems thus far that the website has hit the right tone with many time-strapped singletons with beaming testimonials from the likes of 'Leah', 36 who writes: 'Wish I'd found a site like this sooner! I have found a wonderful weekend lover. He asks for no more and the times we spend together are magical.' Another fan 'Jay, 47' says: 'I've been married and had a family before. I'm glad I did it and got the T-shirt but I don't want to do that again but I'd still love to meet a special girl to care for.' Founder Helen Croydon also writes about the benefits of what she calls the 'low maintenance relationship' in her latest book, Screw the Fairytale, which investigates 'alternative models of relationships to conventional marriage'. Helen is no stranger to unconventional realtionships, having in the past dated older men in return for gifts . No stranger to controversial relationships herself, Helen has written openly about her time as a member of a site that puts wealthy men (usually older) in touch with girls (usually younger) who will date them in return for gifts and an 'allowance'. Helen, now 36, was a middle-class girl from a loving family in small-town Cheshire but six years ago, she joined dating website sugardaddie.com . She started meeting super-rich men who would pay for her company and, by her own admission; she quickly grew addicted to a glamorous life of luxury. 'I stepped into a world where money and sex, not love and respect, are the currency of a relationship. 'I went into the experience with my eyes open. I knew the man would bring money and power to the equation and he might expect sex in return, but I could make up my own mind how far I wanted to go,' Helen told the Daily Mail. 'In a sense, a normal relationship is an exchange of intimacy and emotional support for exclusivity and companionship. 'Instead, my dates compensated materially for what they couldn't offer emotionally. In that context, being paid a monthly allowance didn't seem shocking to me.' However Helen admits that she doesn’t believe that her experiences were not healthy. 'What I didn't see as I was tottering out of five-star hotels in Louboutin heels with more cash in my purse than I knew what to do with was how these experiences were warping my view of relationships,' she says. Her new venture aims to enable those who embrace a less conventional view of romantic attachments to find each other, but both are equal partners.","Aimed at those with 'no expectations of moving in after three .

"They might not have been quite as intimidating as Mitchell Johnson but Eoin Morgan found himself facing two more formidable opponents on his welcome to New Zealand in a Maori warrior and the Mayor of Wellington. After England appeared to get cold feet on their big Valentine’s Day date with Australia they were greeted more warmly here in the New Zealand capital even though the local English mayor was clearly batting for the opposition. Celia Wade-Brown, born in West London but a Wellington resident for more than 30 years, firstly welcomed England captain ‘Eoin Rogers’ and then said: ‘Don’t be fooled by the accent – I’m supporting New Zealand on Friday.’ England's Ian Bell of England takes part in an official Maori welcome in Wellington .

"Roberto Mancini believes Serie A needs to attract more international stars to help restore its former glories - and the Inter Milan manager is still hopeful of starting the ball rolling by signing Manchester City's Yaya Toure in the summer. Mancini has targeted the giant midfielder, who was one of his key charges during his time in charge at City, as the player to spark Inter's revival next season following their recent struggles. Implying in a press conference on Saturday that Italy's top-flight, once the most star-studded in world football, was now a shadow of its 1980s and 90s heyday, Mancini said: 'Serie A needs great players, the ones that played in our league 15, 20 years ago.'

"Ronny Deila has told John Guidetti that the only way to end his goal drought is to forget he’s ever had one. The on-loan Manchester City striker turned in an improved display against Partick Thistle on Wednesday but still couldn’t prevent his run of games without scoring reaching double figures. The Swede, who at one stage boasted an 11 goals in 10 strike-rate, has cut a frustrated figure of late with talks over a permanent move to Parkhead failing to reach a satisfactory conclusion. VIDEO Scroll down to remind yourself of John Guidetti's goal scoring ability . John Guidetti turned in an improved display against Partick Thistle but did not score for Celtic (left) Celtic manager Ronny Deila (centre) has backed striker Guidetti to swiftly end his scoring drought . Guidetti once had a scoring record of 11 in 10 for Celtic but has since fallen on hard times . But Deila believes the key to him getting back in the scoring groove lies with ensuring he is firstly mentally attuned to the task. ‘He has to stop thinking about it and he will score goals as well,’ Deila said. ‘Because you have to think of the process, not results. Goals come as a consequence of good processes. ‘That is maybe the most important thing I have to try and get into this culture. Everything I hear is about results but you have to think how to get those results. ‘And when you fill all the boxes you need to, then you will get those results. That’s how I work and how my players have to work as well. ‘When I see my players working 100 per cent and are switched on, then I know we are going to beat the other team. ‘One day it is John Guidetti doing well, getting two or three goals, the next it is Leigh Griffiths. And then Stefan Johansen. If we are a good team, the chances will come.’ Deila believes that Guidetti (left) can follow Leigh Griffiths' (right) example and return to scoring ways . Deila (right) and assistant John Collins (left) are also preparing for a Europa League tie against Inter Milan . Deila’s side face St Johnstone at lunchtime today and he is adamant Thursday’s clash with Inter Milan hasn’t yet been mentioned to his players although he admits he is liable to pick his team for Perth with one eye on the Europa League clash. ‘They won’t be on my mind,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘I have learned in this job that you have to take it one game at a time. ‘You have to keep the momentum going, you have to win, and if I don’t think only of the next game then the players start to think of something else. ‘Inter Milan is coming next week, but the biggest game is on Saturday. If we have a good performance against St Johnstone then we will take a lot of confidence into the game against Milan. ‘I don’t think the team on Saturday will be the same as the team that plays Inter Milan. ‘We need competition, but healthy competition. It is like we want to make each other better. I pick the player I think best suits the game. ‘Some players can’t handle the load to play so many games so we have to change. James Forrest didn’t play against Partick but he will be ready for Saturday. ‘We have to use the squad wisely and always try to look ahead while keeping the consistency in training and matches. If we do that then everyone will develop.’ Only Mikael Lustig and Charlie Mulgrew look set to miss out on Thursday, but Inter have a defensive injury crisis brewing. Former Manchester United stopper Nemanja Vidic has become the sixth member of Roberto Mancini’s rearguard to labelled a major doubt after suffering from sciatica and will definitely miss tomorrow’s trip to Atalanta. Centre half Marco Andreolli and right back Danilo D’Ambrosio are both out with hamstring injuries and Japanese international full back Yuto Nagatomo will miss both legs with a thigh tear.

"A couple in Washington DC are facing up to a potential wedding day disaster on Saturday because the intended venue for their nuptials was affected by the government shutdown. When Mike Cassesso, 29, and MaiLien Le, 30, decided to marry they wanted to celebrate their union at the site of their first date - the west lawn of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. With their 130 guests already starting to fly in from all over the country for Saturday’s ceremony, they received an ominous e-mail from the National Mall and Memorial Parks permit management office warning them on Monday that their intended venue was in doubt pending last night’s decision on Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video . MaiLien Le, 30, and Mike Cassesso, 29, have had to quickly find an alternative venue for their wedding on Saturday as the west lawn of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial has been closed by the government shutdown . As things stand, unless the government shutdown is resolved by 5.30pm on Saturday then Cassesso and Le plus their family and friends will be barred from stepping foot on the lawn which had until now held so many precious memories for them. ‘Shutdowns are one of those things . that on an intellectual level you know are going to impact an average . person, but you really don’t get it until it hits you in a way like . this,’ Cassesso told the Washington Post. ‘There . are plenty of people around the country who may not understand that . this isn’t just going to hurt nameless government workers and that, in a . depressing way, it impacts your wedding plans with just a few days’ notice.’ The couple are so nostalgic about their first date by the Jefferson Memorial three years ago that, in the run-up to their wedding, they had a professional photographer take pictures of them paddleboating by the memorial again. A woman views the Jefferson Memorial from behind barricades in Washington, DC, on October 1, 2013 following the government shut down at midnight . Washington couple Mike Cassesso and MaiLien Le have admitted they briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site - the Thomas Jefferson Memorial which has been closed as part of the government shutdown . 'This is a very meaningful site to me,' Cassesso. A couple of weeks ago, when they began pondering how a shutdown might impact their nuptials, Cassesso and Le never thought that the wedding site would be off-limits. ‘We just thought there’d be leaves on the ground, that there’d be no maintenance, no rangers or Park Police,’ Cassesso said. They couple even briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site, but their thoughts quickly turned to finding an alternative venue. Unfortunately finding a venue for 130 guests isn’t an easy task at short notice and the couple quickly determined that they had two options – to either marry at their reception venue, the Sonoma Restaurant and Wine Bar on Capitol Hill; or use the backyard of their apartment building. Unless the government shutdown is resolved by 5.30pm on Saturday then Cassesso and Le will get married at the Sonoma Restaurant and Wine Bar on Capitol Hill, the venue for their reception . Although Cassesso was keen to go with their backyard because they’d already spent $700 to rent chairs, his bride put her foot down because the yard is also home to a dumpster. ‘I don’t want there to be a dumpster. It’ll smell,’ said Le. The couple are one of two dozen October weddings on the Mall endangered by the federal shutdown. Nationwide more than 400 parks are impacted by the shutdown, but a spokeswoman for the National Park Service said it doesn’t have a tally for the number of weddings scheduled.","Mike Cassesso and wife-to-be MailLien Le face a last minute headache after the government shutdown closed their intended wedding venue .

"Ronny Deila believes attack will be Celtic's best form of defence against Inter Milan in the first leg of their Europa League last-32 tie at Parkhead on Thursday night. The Hoops boss was speaking after the 2-1 Scottish Premiership win over St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park which extended the league leaders' winning run to eight games. Striker Leigh Griffiths opened the scoring after 35 seconds, beating the debut goal from Gary Mackay-Steven against Partick Thistle on Wednesday night by three seconds. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths celebrates his goal against St Johnstone during their Scottish Premier League match . Midfielder Stefan Johansen doubled the visitors' lead seven minutes after the break before Perth midfielder Michael O'Halloran reduced the deficit in the 72nd minute to end Craig Gordon's eight-game clean sheet run. It ensured a nervy finale in which Gordon made a fine double-save from substitute Brian Graham and skipper Dave Mackay as the Hoops went six points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the table. Deila - who believes midfielder Kris Commons, who missed out again with a hamstring injury, 'is going the right way and has a chance' of making the Inter game - insists he will not change his side's pressing game for Europe. Stefan Johansen celebrates his goal against St Johnstone as Celtic went two-nil up away from home . The Norwegian said: 'We always attack, so nothing is changing. Why should we do that? 'We are at home. We are attacking but we haven't conceded a goal (until today) so I think that is a very good way to protect yourself. 'We will be ourselves but we will know their weaknesses and strengths.' Deila was unconcerned by losing a goal after eight shut-outs. The former Stromsgodset boss said: 'It doesn't mean anything to me. 'I am counting points and that is the most important thing. We are defending well and they didn't have many chances today. Johansen netted for Celtic despite being under pressure from St Johnstone defender Steven Anderson . 'Otherwise, I think we had control of the game. 'In the end there was pressure on us, especially from set-pieces which were good and Gordon made very good saves. 'We played well for 60 minutes, were intense in our pressure, aggressive and created chances. 'We are much more direct now and we take more of the (chances) than we did before but we lost the ball too much as well, so we have to work on that.' St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright rued the loss of the early goal and praised Gordon for his late double save. Ronny Deila gestures to their supporters following their Scottish Premier League match against St Johnstone . Scott Brown challenges Steven MacLean during the victory at McDiarmid Park Stadium . The Northern Irishman, who revealed midfielder Murray Davidson had been taken off in the 15th minute with a calf injury which will be assessed on Monday, said: 'I thought it was quicker than the goal they scored against Partick. 'We had emphasised the point that we had to start well against them. 'I think it is a quality pass and good movement. I haven't watched it back but I think we could have done better. 'We weathered a storm, Alan Mannus made some good saves and we got back in the game. 'We were much better in the second half and we could have easily got a draw at the end but for two tremendous saves from Craig Gordon.'","Celtic secured a 2-1 victory against St Johnstone on Saturday .

The tourist, who revealed herself on Saturday as Karine Gombeau, from Paris, saw Gere standing outside of Grand Central Station at approximately 5:45pm on Tuesday. According to Gombeau, who had just left a pizzeria in Little Italy, he was digging through a trash bin and drinking a beer from a brown paper bag. Scroll down for video . Karine Gombeau, 42, hands who she thought to be a homeless man a bag of food. She later learned that the man was movie star Richard Gere, who is reportedly worth $100 million . 'I said ""Je suis désolée [I am sorry], but the pizza is cold""' Gombeau told the NY Post, who approached the 62 year-old actor with the remnants of an 'enormous' pizza her family had shared but was unable to finish. The pizza was carried in a plastic 'I Love NY' bag. 'He said ""Thank you so much. God bless you.""' recalled Gombeau. She did not know until she saw herself in a newspaper two days later that the man she extended her generosity to was Gere, the star of such blockbusters as 'Pretty Woman' and 'An Officer and a Gentleman.'  He is reportedly worth $100 million. Gere was in Manhattan filming for his next movie, 'Time Out of Mind', which he stars in with Jena Malone and Kyra Sedgwick. Both Gere and Sedgwick were spotted in the city last week, staying in character as vagrants. Gombeau was not the only passerby that Gere fooled that day. Another, Mizan Rahman, a salesman, told the NY Post that Gere 'looked like a natural homeless guy. ... It didn't seem like he was acting.' Richard Gere standing over a trash can eating french fries.

Gere with co-star Kyra Sedgwick (left) / Richard Gere on the red carpet for the Hollywood Film Awards in October 2012 (right) Gombeau said that she is emotionally affected by seeing others scrounging in the trash to find food. 'It leaves me really sad to know we waste food and they have nothing,' she said. 'It really moves me.' Reportedly, Gere was filmed by cameras positioned far away from him, allowing him to wander through Grand Central Station without people realizing that a shoot was in progress. However, Gombeau said that there was a detail that, in retrospect, gave away the secret that her and her family were walking through a movie set. 'People came from all over the station and told my husband to stop . filming,' said Gombeau, whose family was traveling with their own handheld camera to document their trip. 'People came out of the subways. It was very . confusing.'","Tourist from Paris sees man digging in a garbage can and gives him her leftover pizza .

"Co-hosts New Zealand made it two wins from two at the World Cup, but they were made to work harder than expected for their three-wicket triumph over Scotland in Dunedin. Trent Boult took two for 21 to be the pick of a blistering New Zealand attack, which left Scotland reeling on 12 for four early on and claimed four golden ducks. Matt Machan (56 off 79 balls) and Richie Berrington (50 off 80 balls) helped Scotland eke out a total of 142, but the Kiwis still looked set to claim an easy win.

The Scots dug in, though, and Kane Williamson's 45-ball 38 was the top individual score for the Black Caps as they pushed hard and lost seven wickets before ultimately claiming the win with 151 balls remaining. Hopes will remain high that Scotland can win their first-ever World Cup match at this year's tournament, but the in-form Black Caps showed early signs they were not going to be caught short at the University Oval. The Scots, who beat Ireland and pushed West Indies close in the warm-up matches, got off to the worst possible start and slumped to 12 for four after just 4.2 overs. New Zealand, who named an unchanged side from their opening 98-run win over Sri Lanka, won the toss and elected to field, with that decision paying immediate dividends as Boult and Tim Southee wreaked early havoc. Boult drew first blood, claiming two wickets in two balls as Calum Macleod and Hamish Gardiner both departed for golden ducks at the start of the second over. Not to be outdone, Southee replicated Boult's efforts two overs later as Kyle Coetzer (one) departed after finding Grant Elliott at short mid-wicket and then Scots skipper Preston Mommsen walked straight after for a first-ball duck.

Richie Berrington drives a delivery as he made 50 from 80 balls in Scotland's innings . A 97-run fifth-wicket partnership between Machan and Berrington steadied the ship for Scotland, but the rest of their batting order fell away as New Zealand's red-hot attack wrapped their innings up in 36.2 overs. Machan brought up an impressive 71-ball fifty around the halfway point of Scotland's allotted overs, with Berrington smashing a six over long-on from Daniel Vettori afterwards in celebration. But Corey Anderson ended their stand in the 28th over, as Machan (56) top-edged an attempted pull to Brendon McCullum at mid-on, and then he got Berrington out two overs later, just after the 27-year-old claimed his seventh ODI fifty to leave the Scots on 117 for six. Anderson and Vettori then mopped up the tail between them, taking three wickets in total apiece, with Scotland's innings ending how it started as Vettori caught Iain Wardlaw in front for a golden duck. The final four wickets fell for just 25 runs. Martin Guptill (17) was a man in a hurry as New Zealand looked to complete their chase of 143 at breakneck speed.

The Kiwi opener smashed two fours in as many overs and then found back-to-back boundaries at the start of the third over, before his ambition got the better of him and his attempted lift over long off was edged behind to Matthew Cross. Black Caps skipper McCullum (15) walked to the same combination at the end of the seventh over as Scotland began to dig in, leaving New Zealand on 63 for two at lunch. The expected onslaught from the co-hosts was slow in coming and Ross Taylor was out for nine in the second over after lunch, before a fourth-wicket stand of 40 from Williamson and Elliott anchored the Black Caps' innings. Williamson (38) became the first of three Josh Davey victims in the 18th over and Elliott (29) fell soon after to leave New Zealand on 117 for five, needing 26 off 29 overs to claim the win. With New Zealand continuing to force the issue Davey made things interesting by claiming two wickets in three balls as Anderson (seven) and Luke Ronchi (12) both fell in quick succession as the co-hosts finished the 24th over five runs short with three wickets left. Vettori finally wrapped things up for the Black Caps in the next over as he unconvincingly top-edged through the slip region for four to take New Zealand to 146 with just over half their allotted overs remaining.","New Zealand made a fast start against Scotland, taking four early wickets .

"Coca-Cola has taken over Innocent after the ethical smoothie maker's young founders decided to sell up their remaining stakes for a dizzying £100million, according to reports. The fizzy drinks empire, which already owned 58 per cent of Innocent, snapped up the shareholdings of founders Richard Reed, Adam Balon and John Wright in a deal that gives Coca Cola at least 90 per cent ownership and values Innocent in the region of £320million. The brand’s creators . - Cambridge graduates who first sold their smoothies 15 years ago from a music festival stall - will give up day-to-day management responsibilities in May, but they . will remain on the executive committee and insisted the brand's ethic would not be compromised by the takeover. Cashing in: Innocent founders (l-r) Richard Reed, Adam Balon and John Wright have sold their remaining stakes to Coca-Cola for a reported £100million . Rapid expansion: The three Cambridge graduates, pictured in 1999, first sold their smoothies 15 years ago from a music festival stall . Innocent was founded in 1998 to capitalise on the growing market for healthy drinks and smoothies. Mr Reed, 36, Adam Balon, 37, and Jon Wright, 36, who had all been friends at Cambridge, initially bought £500 of fruit to make smoothies at the Jazz on the Green festival in Parsons Green, south-west London. Customers told them the drinks were so good they should leave their jobs in management consultancy and advertising to set up Innocent. By 2007, Innocent had cornered the smoothie market and made a profit of £8million, but a year later provoked controversy after selling an 18 per cent stake to Coca-Cola for £30million. In 2010, Coca Cola bought out original backer Maurice Pinto and his friend Jules Hydleman, who first invested £250,000 . into the business, paying another £65million to increase its ownership . to 58 per cent. Not so innocent now: Coca-Cola has increased its stake in the smoothie maker from 58 per cent to more than 90 per cent . One pot at a time: Innocent first launched its healthy veg pot range in September 2008 . Stay smooth: Innocent is most famous for its range of fruit smoothies but in more recent years it has branched out to launch a juice and healthy veg ready meal range.

"Prince, Paris and Blanket are still waiting for their payday as Michael Jackson's $600million estate is still stumbling to pay off his debts and fund their long-anticipated trust fund. Sources told the Daily News that the King of Pop's attorneys and financial managers have to settle more than $100million in debt before anyone in the family can touch it, forcing the three children to live off of a meager salary of just $70,000 a month. It could take two to five more years for everything to be resolved, upon which case the three kin of the King will share 50 per cent of the assets while Katherine Jackson will get the other half. Siblings: Prince, Paris and Blanket are still waiting for their payday as Michael Jackson's $600million estate is still stumbling to pay off his debts and fund their trust. Paris, center, and her brothers  Prince, 15, right, and Blanket, 10, left, are pictured taking part in the four-day tribute to Michael Jackson on his birthday last week . Allowance: The King of Pop's attorneys and financial managers have to settle more than $100million in debt before anyone in the family can touch it, forcing the three children to live off of a meager salary of just $70,000 a month . 'The probate is still pending, and although almost all of Michael’s personal debt has been or is about to be paid in full, the estate is technically still in debt,' estate lawyer Howard Weitzman said to the Daily News. 'Once all of the creditors’ claims, taxes and pending litigation have been resolved, the trusts will be funded per court order.' The estate has been raking in money since Jackson died on June 25, 2009, thanks to revenue generated by his music, likeness and salvaged assets worth an unknown fortune. '(It’s) too early to speculate on any precise number for a value. It will be a substantial number, I’m certain,' Mr Weitzman said. But the three scions of the star have to live on a tightly-controlled allowance overseen by a judge and the estate's executors. Katherine Jackson, the 82-year-old matriarch of the clan, has also not received any money from the trust.

Drama: Earlier this year, a judge ruled Michael Jackson's nephew TJ, left, should permanently share guardianship responsibilities with Katherine Jackson, right, for the King of Pop's three children . The 'Michael Jackson Family Trust' dictates that the singer's three kids and Mrs Jackson divide the funds. 'To some of Katherine’s children, this is a shocking situation. They see on paper that Michael has made $600 million and cannot understand why all of it is not going to the family,' a separate source told The Daily News. Revenue: The estate has been raking in money since Jackson died on June 25, 2009, thanks to revenue generated by his music, likeness and salvaged assets worth an unknown fortune . 'This has been the case for a long time. They always think the worst is happening and people are taking money.' Earlier this year, Randy, Jermaine, Janet and Rebbie squabbled over Katherine's share, luring her to Arizona for a 'spa treatment'. With Katherine indisposed, the siblings demanded the estate executor's John Branca and John McClaine resign over fraud allegations and managed to get Katherine's custody of the children revoked. A judge then ruled Michael Jackson's nephew TJ should permanently share guardianship responsibilities for the King of Pop's three children. Other sources say that the siblings want to expedite Katherine's access to the money, insisting that she would be more likely to share her fortune with the whole family if given the chance. But don't feel too bad for the 'paupers', all three enjoy a lavish lifestyle in a gated mansion with round-the-clock security, private schooling and over-the-top vacations. And if everything goes according to plan, all three will end up as multimillionaires thanks to their father's popularity as well as his wise investment in the Beatles' music catalog. The kids will have to wait until their 21 to control their assets, but after that, they will get major payouts at ages 30, 35 and 40.

Michael Jackson as she and her siblings celebrated his 54th birthday . Katherine Jackson's attorney Perry Sanders is arranging an audit of the money so when it starts flowing, every cent will be accounted for. 'My audit is being done to see the details of where the money is coming from and where it is going,' he said. 'The beneficiaries should be entitled to all detailed documentation so they can see what their money is paying for.'

"An eager and diligent student forever searching for ways to improve his game, Jonny Gray has turned to a few different mentors in his time; be it Al Kellock at Glasgow or Jim Hamilton in the Scotland squad, the callow young second row has been blessed to be taken under the wing of hardened veterans. When it comes to an inspirational role model, though, Gray makes no apologies for stating the blooming obvious when he singles out older brother Richie as the person most responsible for lighting the path to international rugby. Not 21 for another month, the younger of the instantly recognisable brothers will win only his 10th cap when he plays against Wales on Sunday, almost certainly partnering his sibling in the middle of the pack. Scotland lock Jonny Gray (right) puts in a strong tackle on France winger Yoann Huget in Paris . While big bro Richie, now 25 and homing in on a half century of caps, may stand a few inches taller, it's the kid who calls the line-outs. The youngster who appears driven to emulate — and maybe even surpass? — the achievements of the elder. 'Rich, for me, is the biggest role model I've had growing up,' said Jonny. 'It's just great to have a guy like that by my side. 'It's still pretty surreal to be playing together for Scotland. And it's hard to describe. Just to be involved in the set-up is a special feeling — but to have him here as well, it's incredible. It's something I never thought would happen. 'Just growing up watching Rich, I've been lucky to have him there and to see first-hand how hard he had to work to get where he is. Gray lines up France loosehead Alexandre Menini during his mammoth shift at the Stade de France . 'His diet, his extras, his training. For me to see that first-hand, there were no excuses for me. 'And he's the same here, still out doing his extras, still out there working hard. So that's a great example and to have someone like that around is amazing.' Asked if he thought his own rise through the ranks may even be providing a spur for Richie to work even harder, Jonny insisted: 'No. I think Rich is a top-class player. I'm always learning from him. 'But throughout the team there is a great team spirit, the work in training that everyone does for each other is great, everyone working to help each other. 'I've been very lucky to work with Jim. He's like Al at Glasgow for me, great to sit down and talk with, share his experiences at line-outs and in other areas. Jonny Gray (left) lines up to sing the Scotland national anthem alongside older brother Richie in November . 'There are examples of that throughout the squad. To have someone like that for me is amazing.' Now, if young Jonny ever starts to speak with the effusive sense of adventure he brings to his on-field performances, he'll be guaranteed a good living on the lecture circuit; Carnegie Hall — the one in New York, rather than Dunfermline — would await any talker able to convey the kind of excitement generated by his rampaging playing style. At the moment, though, nearly everything Gray says seems determinedly downbeat, his bland answers to even the most gently inviting questions suggesting either an overload of PR training — or some worrying early signs of concussion. Muhammad Ali in his prime, he ain't. Fortunately, none of that matters once he crosses the white line. The fact that he either cannot or will not go into detail about Scotland's plans for the Welsh, even turning the subject of the visitors' apparent weakness in the line-out into words of praise for their efficacy at that particular set-piece, is neither here nor there. Jonny Gray drives forward with ball in hand as Scotland pushed France all the way before losing 15-8 . He isn't paid to share tactical insights, doesn't pull on the jersey for a chance to get all touchy-feely. Unless by that you mean getting hold of an opponent and feeling the will drain out of him — just ask Yoann Huget… . So yes, there has been work done on stopping the driving maul that France used to such good effect last week. And no, there isn't anyone in the Scotland camp who believes Wales are the least bit predictable. 'When you look at Wales, their games in the autumn and then against England last week, you can see how direct they are,' said Gray. 'They're very physical, they're tough around the breakdown and they've got dangerous runners throughout the team. So we know how hard the game is going to be. 'The team spirit here is very strong. We go into every game thinking we can win. But we know how tough it's going to be. It's going to be a massive challenge. Wales are going to be hurting after their loss to England, so we need to prepare as best we can. We've looked at the France game and, ultimately, we're disappointed we didn't get the result. 'There are a lot of positives to take but, at the same time, a lot of improvements need to be made. 'We know how dangerous Wales are going to be this week so we need to get our preparations right going into that.' With that, Gray retired to — for all we may know — eat a whole cow, perform a couple of thousand press-ups, do an extra hour of core work and start kicking down solid oak doors by way of preparation for welcoming the Welsh. Sounds daft? If Richie started doing any or all of the above, you can be sure that Jonny would follow suit. Why change a winning formula, right?","Jonny Gray will win his 10th cap against Wales on Sunday .

"E-cigarettes designed to help people quit smoking could act as a 'gateway' to addiction to illegal drugs, scientists in the U.S. have today warned . E-cigarettes designed to help people quit smoking could act as a 'gateway' to addiction to illegal drugs, scientists have today warned. Like conventional cigarettes, the devices are said to raise the risk of addiction to banned substances including cannabis and cocaine. Scientists pointed out that while eliminating many of the toxic compounds found in tobacco, e-cigarettes delivered highly addictive 'pure nicotine'. In mice, nicotine was found to alter brain biochemistry and prime the animals to develop a need for cocaine. Analysis of human data suggested it had the same effect in people, with cocaine addiction rates highest among former cigarette smokers. Professor Eric Kandel, who conducted the research with his wife, Dr Denise Kandel, said: 'Our findings provided a biological basis for the sequence of drug use observed in people. 'One drug alters the brain's circuitry in a way that enhances the effects of a subsequent drug.' Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, the married couple from Columbia University, New York, warned: 'E-cigarettes have the same physiological effects on the brain and may pose the same risk of addiction to other drugs as regular cigarettes, especially in adolescence during a critical period of brain development. 'We don't yet know whether e-cigarettes will prove to be a gateway to the use of conventional cigarettes and illicit drugs, but that's certainly a possibility. 'Nicotine clearly acts as a gateway drug on the brain, and this effect is likely to occur whether the exposure comes from smoking cigarettes, passive tobacco smoke, or e-cigarettes.' The typical e-cigarette user is a long-term smoker who has been unable to quit, they said. But popularity of the devices was increasing at an accelerating rate among adolescents and young adults. 'The effects we saw in adult mice are probably even stronger in adolescent animals,' said Eric Kandel, who in 2000 shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the physiological basis of memory. 'E-cigarettes may be a gateway to both combustible cigarettes and illicit drugs. 'Therefore, we should do all we can to protect young people from the harmful effects of nicotine and the risks of progressing to illicit drugs.' His wife added: 'The recent legalisation of marijuana in Colorado and Washington has rekindled the debate about whether marijuana is a gateway drug. 'Yet both proponents and opponents of legalisation have overlooked the role of nicotine in leading to the use of illicit drugs and to addiction.' The married scientists Eric and Denise Kandel pointed out that while eliminating many of the toxic compounds found in tobacco, e-cigarettes delivered highly addictive 'pure nicotine'. In mice, nicotine was found to alter brain biochemistry and prime the animals to develop a need for cocaine. File picture . Professor Jeffrey Lieberman, chair of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, said: 'The emergence in our society of new recreational pharmaceuticals such as e-cigarettes and legalised marijuana, while justifiable on one level, may have adverse consequences of which we are not fully aware. 'The Kandels' research on 'gateway' drugs demonstrates such grave potential consequences.' More than a million people in the UK are believed to get their nicotine 'fix' from e-cigarettes, but opinion is divided about the safety of the devices. E-cigarettes have a surprisingly long history dating back to 1963 when Herbert A Gilbert, a 40-a-day smoker from Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, filed a patent for a 'smokeless non-tobacco cigarette'. His invention worked by gently heating a nicotine solution to produce a vapour that could be inhaled, thereby 'replacing burning tobacco and paper with heated, moist, flavoured air'. But at a time when 70 per cent of adult males in the UK alone were regular smokers, he failed to secure financial backing for the idea.","Married scientists from Columbia University have warned e-cigarettes have same psychological effects on the brain as traditional ones .

"Plans for a third runway at Heathrow have finally been scrapped after Labour joined the Coalition in ruling out an expansion at the airport. The controversial plans, which attracted widespread criticism from environmentalists, are now 'off the agenda', despite a third runway being backed by the previous Labour government. Activists had opposed plans for an expansion at Heathrow on the grounds of disturbance and pollution from aircraft. Overcrowded: Although Heathrow Airport is said to be running at 98 per cent capacity, a ban has been put in place on expansion of its runways . The Shadow Transport Secretary, Maria Eagle, explained to The Guardian that the reason for Labour's U-turn on the proposed runway was due to the local environmental impact. She said: 'The answer for the south-east is not going to be to fall back on the third runway at Heathrow... it is off the agenda.' Transport Secretary Justine Greening confirmed the decision but denied it meant ministers are 'anti-aviation'. And although expansion of Heathrow was ruled out, Greening would not reject outright Boris Johnson's ambitious plans to build an airport in the Thames estuary near Kent. Speaking at an aviation conference in London, Ms Greening admitted the third runway plan 'had its share of critics', adding: 'The political reality is that the (Heathrow) runway decision has been made and it is done. Off the agenda: Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle, left, ruled out building a new runway at Heathrow, while new Transport Secretary Justine Greening, right, confirmed there would be no third runway . 'I want to emphasise that the decision we took does not mean we are anti-aviation. 'This Transport Secretary and this Government are anything but. 'I know just how many people rely on an efficient, effective and successful Heathrow - for work and for travel. I get just how crucial aviation is to our national wellbeing - economically, socially and environmentally. With Heathrow and Gatwick both full to capacity, ministers are keen to find a solution to ease the strain on Britain's two busiest airports. 'Heathwick' Airport rail link: Heathrow and Gatwick airports could be linked by a high-speed rail network to create the world's first 'virtual hub' airport under proposals considered last month. Dubbed 'Heathwick', the scheme would see a £5billion high-speed rail service linking the west London site to west Sussex in 15 minutes. Travelling at speeds of 180mph, trains would leave every five minutes and would follow the route of the M25. 'Boris Island': London mayor Boris Johnson’s revealed plans three years ago for a London airport built on artificial islands in the tidal waters of the Thames. The 'Boris Island' transport hub would see a £40billion airport built off the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. 'And I recognise that the industry needs certainty and decision making in the long-term national interest, not chopping and changing for reasons of short-term political advantage.' She added: 'It's time to turn the page and write a new chapter in the story of aviation. Prominent in that new chapter will be a credible, workable aviation strategy.' Greening used the speech to airport operators to also reaffirm the government's block of new runways at Stanstead and Gatwick. However, when asked if she ruled out a new airport hub in the south-east altogether, she said: 'No. There are a number of airports in the south-east; we have people like the mayor who has proposals for new airports.' According to the Guardian, Ms Greening refused to rule out the Mayor of London's 'Boris Island' airport plans, adding: 'There are a number of different proposals that we have to look at... I have no doubt he will want to raise that with me.' It emerged earlier this year that Britain's busiest airports like Heathrow are running at 98 per cent capacity. Enlarge .

Celebrity backing: Actor and impressionist Alistair McGowan was one of many to back the demonstration against the third runway . Overcrowded skies above the UK led to planes spending a cumulative 55 hours a day circling Heathrow waiting to land. Fuel worth £119,000 alone is wasted above London every day as planes 'stack' delaying an average of 55,800 passengers for between four and 20 minutes. Jon Proudlove, managing director of NATS air traffic control, said in June that London was 'on a knife edge' because of the lack of runways across the city that means planes are stacked as a matter of course. Ms Greening added: 'Sometimes it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that strategy is all about dealing with single issues, such as capacity for example. 'I believe our aviation strategy for our country has to be far broader-based than just the capacity question, though I recognise the importance of that question. Actually, the best strategies cover all the bases. 'They're focused on the short term and the long term, the economic and the environmental, the local and the global, the needs of the sector and the needs of the passenger.' Ms Greening said she recognised that some at the conference were in favour of a third runway at Heathrow. She told them that the best solutions emerged 'when all sides are fully engaged and properly involved'.","Landing strip ruled out due to 'environmental impact'

"Real Madrid are turning the corner after a stuttering start to the year and Wednesday's Champions League clash at Schalke 04 will prove it, according to coach Carlo Ancelotti. The title holders, aiming to become the first team to retain the Champions League crown, will have defender Pepe fit for the last-16 game. Real, chasing their 11th European Cup, have struggled this year, having been knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atletico Madrid while a 4-0 drubbing at their city rivals in La Liga this month cut their lead over second-placed Barcelona to a point. Cristiano Ronaldo trains with Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday ahead of their match against Schalke . Ronaldo will be looking to help Carlo Ancelotti's side gain an advantage over Schalke in the first leg of their Champions League clash . Ancelotti believes Real have turned a corner after a tough start to the new year and they will prove that against Schalke . Portuguese duo Pepe (left) and Ronaldo look focused ahead of their tie at the Veltins Arena . 'With such a result (against Atletico) it is important to turn the corner quickly. We did it well against Deportivo La Coruna (with a 2-0 win). But we can improve and we want to show that tomorrow,' Ancelotti told reporters on Tuesday. He sounded confident Cristiano Ronaldo will quickly rediscover his scoring form with the Portugal captain off colour since winning a third FIFA Ballon d'Or award last month. He again failed to score in Saturday's unconvincing win at home to Deportivo and has managed only four goals this year, low by his prolific standard. 'Against Deportivo I think he looked physically very good. He had the intensity. I think he is constantly improving. He has not scored yet but tomorrow he has the chance to do it.'

No club has retained the Champions League trophy since its introduction in 1992/93 and Ancelotti said a return to Schalke, after demolishing them 6-1 at the same stage last year before going on to win the title, was a good omen. 'This is fantastic motivation for us,' Ancelotti, who won back-to-back European Cup titles as a player at AC Milan in 1989 and 1990, said. 'We were here (at Schalke) with the dream to win it last year and we are here this year and we have the same dream. 'History will say it is really difficult, almost impossible but we have to try,' he said.","Carlo Ancelotti said Real Madrid will prove they have turned a corner after tough start to new year .

"Teenagers are often seen trying to study  while listening to music, watching TV and juggling texts and tweets. But new research by two final year school girls, overseen by Stanford University, found that 85 per cent of young people struggle to perform simple tasks when distracted by music, phones or email. For a fortunate 15 per cent of so-called 'high media multitaskers', performance actually improves when there is outside stimuli. Scroll down for video . New research by two final year school girls, overseen by Stanford University, found that 85 per cent of young people struggle to perform simple tasks when distracted by music, phones or email . More than 400 students, with an average age of 14-and-a-half, were analysed during the three-year study which was overseen by Clifford Class, a Stanford University professor. Sarayu Caulfield, 17, one of the study's authors, said: 'We really wanted to see how media multitasking is affecting young people. 'Media multitasking is a huge part of young people's lives. So we may be able to cope with switching between tasks better ... but most people still work at their best while focusing on one thing.' The researchers used a series of cognitive tests to measure how distractions affected the ability to complete simple tasks. They were then classified as high, medium or low media multitaskers, using a standardised test developed by researchers at Stanford University. Those rated at the high level reported spending an average of three hours a day multitasking, including at least 50% of the time they were doing homework. Students at the low level spent 20 minutes a day multitasking on average, and barely at all while doing homework. Of the 403 total participants, 60 were classified in the high group, 50 in the low group and the rest were moderate media multitaskers. Alexandra Ulmer, 18, who worked on the project said: 'But this one group of people—the high media multitaskers—performed best when they are in a multitasking environment. The high media multitaskers actually excelled in the multitasking room. 'Maybe we see high media multitaskers excelling in this area because they've grown up with technology their entire lives ... The results mean students should focus on what kind of learner they are, so they know how to work best.' The students, who say they aren't heavy multitaskers themselves, conducted the study as part of the Oregon Episcopal School's science-research program. 'My friends laugh at me because I have to sit in a totally silent room to concentrate,' said Ms Ulmer. Previous research has suggested that the use of multiple digital devices simultaneously can change the structure of the brain. Academics at Sussex University, published in the online journal PLOS, found high media multitaskers had a lower grey-matter density in a part of the brain that determines how we think and feel. Other studies have suggested that genetics could play a part in ability to multitask.","Young people struggle with simple tasks when distracted, study finds .

"Vincent Debaty has won a seat on France's bench to face Ireland purely because Philippe Saint-Andre expects the prop to extend his dominance over rival Marty Moore. Ireland sealed the 2014 Six Nations title with a 22-20 victory in Paris, but Leus Bleus replacement Debaty held a clear scrummaging edge on substitute Moore amid the nerve-jangling closing stages. Leinster prop Moore has already admitted he is geared up for Saturday's Dublin rematch, and now France boss Saint-Andre has conceded Debaty's dominance last year sealed his selection. Vincent Debaty (third left) has been included in the France squad for the Ireland match on Saturday . Ireland's Marty Moore (left), in training with Cian Healy last week, was dominated by Debaty last year . Moore is expected to be named on Ireland's bench for the second-round Six Nations clash, teeing up another last-quarter scrum tussle with Debaty, included after injury to Alexandre Menini. 'Debaty gave his Irish opposite number a really hard time in the final 20 minutes of the game last season so it is logical to have him on the bench,' said France coach Saint-Andre. 'Our bench is packed with power players so we can introduce them late on and they will give the impetus to break tackles and gain ground.' France have made just one change to the line-up that saw off Scotland 15-8 in Paris last weekend, Eddy Ben Arous starting in place of Menini. Veteran Debaty has been drafted onto the bench when Thomas Domingo was expected to step up, with Saint Andre not disguising his aims to exploit a perceived upper-hand over Leinster's Moore. Ireland are expected to hand Johnny Sexton an immediate return at fly-half following their 26-3 win in Italy, after the Racing Metro playmaker completed his enforced 12-week concussion lay-off. Head coach Joe Schmidt will name his squad on Thursday afternoon, but France boss Saint Andre has already told his players to heap early pressure on fit-again Sexton this weekend. Former Sale and Toulon boss Saint-Andre also believes Ireland remain favourites to retain the Six Nations title, with Schmidt's men gunning for a ninth consecutive victory this weekend. 'Sexton is a stalwart of this Ireland side, but he hasn't played for 12 weeks and we should really test him early on,' said Saint-Andre. Brian O'Driscoll holds the trophy aloft as Ireland won the 2014 Six Nations in Paris last year . 'Ireland are full of confidence and showed that when they seized the game by the scruff of the neck against the Italians once they were down to 14 men. 'They have won eight in a row and are the favourites for the title.' Fast-developing tighthead Moore might have edged ahead of Mike Ross at Leinster, but is likely to continue to sit behind the 33-year-old at Test level. Ross remains boss Schmidt's only ever-present Test selection, and there is no reason for that to change ahead of France's Aviva Stadium visit. Moore admitted he was hit by a harsh scrummaging lesson from Debaty as Ireland swept to the Six Nations title in Paris last year - and is hell-bent on avoiding a repeat. 'I wasn't happy with my dealings with them last year, so I'm looking forward to getting a chance to right a few things,' said Moore. 'I suppose a year is a long time in pro sport, so as a more experienced player I know what to expect at the set-piece. 'Debaty brings a lot to their front-row: he's a very aggressive player, very aggressive in the set-piece. 'Whatever way it comes, I'm sure I'll be squatting down against him at some stage.'","Vincent Debaty has been given a place on France's bench .

"Martin Middleton, 26, pleaded guilty to a charge of causing an explosion at Bolton Crown Court yesterday and will be sentenced later this year . A man lost several fingers when a home-made pipe bomb exploded, causing the entire street to be evacuated. Martin Middleton, 26, called 999 and was later picked up by paramedics after apparently fleeing the house he shares with his fiancee. About 40 homes had to be evacuated after the explosion in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in January this year, while police and bomb disposal teams searched the area. His fiancee Kay Emerson escaped uninjured. Previously, Middleton had posted a pencil drawing of a tattoo design . that he wanted, depicting an exploding bomb with the word 'kaboom' in . the middle, on his Facebook page. But he told friends: 'mum wont let me have a pipe bomb on my arm i get it done'. Middleton, from the Tonge Fold area of the town, yesterday pleaded guilty to causing an explosion likely . to endanger life or injure property. David Toal, defending, said: 'He . acknowledges that there was some forseeability for harm, but there was . no intention that is in the particulars. 'The defendant accepts that there wasn’t any intention on his behalf to endanger life. 'The defendant has pleaded guilty. Essentially there is no basis save for recklessness.' The case has been adjourned until June . 14 for a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report to be prepared. Middleton has been remanded in custody. Judge Peter Davies told him: 'It is important that you co-operate with the preparation of the report.' Middleton, who is expecting a baby with his fiancee, . admitted an offence under the Explosive . Substances Act 1883. Mr Toal added: 'I have spent some considerable time researching case authority for offences pursuant to section two of this act. Before the accident in January this year, Middleton had posted a picture of an exploding bomb tattoo design he wanted, left, and a photo of facial burns, thought to be from a previous bomb, on social networking sites . 'It is right to say there are no previous cases that can be found where factors relate to any similarity to the current case. 'Generally speaking they are far more serious than this case.' It also emerged outside court that this may not have been the first time he had experimented with home-made explosives. He is believed to have previously suffered serious facial burns after making a tennis ball bomb. A source claimed he bragged to former work colleagues in South Wales. One of them said: 'One of the boys at work found a picture of him on a search on the internet. 'He said he was using matches to make a tennis ball bomb and it blew up in his face.” A comment on the pictures, apparently . by Middleton, was written on social networking website Where Are You Now?, saying: 'Me . a year ago not like that any more.' Middleton is believed to be expecting a baby with his fiancee Kay Emerson . Middleton is thought to have worked in South Wales, having lived in Aberdeen before that, between July and November last year. The former colleague said: 'When he . first came he was mouthy and full of confidence. He was a grafter for . the first couple of weeks. 'But then he changed. He was a bit of a pain. Police and bomb disposal teams attended the scene of the explosion back in January, pictured, where 40 homes had to be evacuated . 'I am surprised he put a picture of his injuries on a social networking site - it is a strange thing to do.' A neighbour said at the time of the blast: 'I am really shocked at what happened.

"Brooklyn Democrat Vito Lopez announced today he will resign from the state assembly next month - but still plans on running for city council in November . An embattled New York lawmaker who allegedly inappropriately touched female aides and expressed interest in sleeping with a 14-year-old intern resigned from office today. Vito Lopez, who previously ran the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, said he'll give up his seat in the state assembly next month - but claims its only because he wants to run for the city council, and not because of the damning allegations. 'I have made no secret that I intend to run for New York City Council in November, which requires me to resign my current term,' Lopez, 71, said. 'Nevertheless, because the citizens of my district voted me back into office last November by an overwhelming majority, I feel obligated to serve out this session of the Assembly,' he wrote. But his announcement wasn't good enough for some. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat and potential presidential contender in 2016, demanded Lopez leave public life immediately. 'Vito Lopez should not spend another day in office, let alone a whole month,' Cuomo said, according to the New York Post. 'He should resign effective immediately and if he does not, he must be expelled.' Lopez's announcement comes one day after a damning report of his pervy shenanigans was released. Lopez bombarded eight female aides with orders to massage him, wear skimpy clothing and spend the night in hotels with him - but State Assembly officials let him get away with it, the report said. He told one woman he was dying from his cancer and 'needed' her while forcing her to feel the tumors on his neck, shoulder and armpit. One aide told how Lopez forced her to . massage his hand while he was driving in Atlantic City - even though she . told him she had been raped, was crying and said she felt . uncomfortable. Another contracted conjunctivitis after the Brooklyn Democrat made her put drops into his eye, while he demanded that aides write complimentary letters and text messages to and about him. He was also accused of saying he found a 14-year-old intern so 'sexy' that he wished he lived in a state where it was legal to sleep with underage girls. Two of the women secretly recorded their encounters with the Assemblyman, who faced a criminal probe into his actions. The aides feared that their careers would be ruined by Lopez if they spoke up. Those who gave in were handed raises and promotions, while those who resisted faced bullying, reports the NY Daily News. Lopez will not face charges in Brooklyn, it was announced yesterday, though it is not known if he may face criminal investigations in other places where offenses are said to have taken place. Two reports released yesterday, by a special prosecutor and the Ethics Commission, said that Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver and the Assembly's lawyers failed to act to stop Lopez. 'Money flow and our desire to keep this away from media scrutiny . complicates the resolution of this matter,' wrote Bill Collins, a senior . Assembly lawyer, in one email in the report. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants Lopez to resign immediately or face expulsion from the Assembly . The report accused senior staffers of failing to investigate the allegations, first made by two women in December 2011 and January 2012, and failing to refer them to the Assembly ethics committee. Instead, the women received a $103,000 taxpayer settlement, bound by a secrecy clause. They were contacted by Assembly lawyers to remind them of the secrecy clause when Lopez's behavior was reported later in the year. Complaints from two more women, Victoria Burhans and Chloe Rivera were reported to the Assembly Ethics Commission, which led to Lopez's conduct being made public. Silver then stripped Lopez of his leadership positions in the Assembly. Lopez's behavour was not tackled by Assembly leaders, who were criticised for being too interested in protecting their reputation than investigating the claims . In a statement, Victoria Burhans and . Chloe Rivera said: 'Albany’s culture is one in which young women are . often mistreated and bad behavior by powerful men is condoned and . covered up. 'We hope that the Commission’s findings will lead to much needed reform.' Their attorney Kevin Mintzer said: 'The commission’s findings confirm that Vito Lopez is a serial sexual harasser and that he has repeatedly violated the law. 'Had the speaker and his staff fulfilled their legal and ethical obligations, Ms. Burhans and Ms. Rivera would never have been subject to Mr. Lopez’s outrageous conduct.' In a statement, Lopez denied the 'salacious and sensational claims', reports the New York Times. He said: 'Should there ever come a time when Mr. Lopez is actually afforded the fundamental rights supposedly allowed everyone, the truth will finally be told. Special prosecutor Dan Donovan, who is also the Staten Island District Attorney, called his findings on Lopez 'alarming' 'There is an all-out war against an ailing senior member.' Special prosecutor Dan Donovan, the Staten Island district attorney, said the findings of his report were 'alarming'. 'The chief concern of those in the Assembly was mitigating the Assembly’s damages,' he said. 'That goal outweighed any interest in investigating or disciplining Assembly Member Lopez or in preventing similar occurrences in the future.' 'Lopez engaged in a pervasive pattern of abuse of public office and resources, not for personal financial gain, but to indulge his personal whims and desires,' wrote the Ethics Commission. The commission found Lopez guilty of at least three violations of the state’s Public Officers Law. He could be fined as much as a $10,000, but any penalties will be decided by a joint Senate-Assembly panel. The Assembly’s Standing Committee on Ethics is to decide whether any further action, including censure of expulsion, will be taken against Lopez.","Vito Lopez, 71, says he'll step down at end of legislative session next month .

"Former Chelsea and Everton striker Samuel Eto’o has splashed out a serious amount of money to buy an Italian villa, reports Corriere Dello Sport. The £18.5million Italian mansion was said to have been bought by Eto’o despite locals warning him it is haunted by the curse of the Tutankhamun. The Cameroonian footballer has purchased the historic property in Portofino, near Genoa in northern Italy. This luxury coastal villa in Italy is said to be jinxed by the curse of Tutankhamun after it was once owned by Lord Carnarvon who discovered the Pharaoh's tomb. Samuel Eto'o is said to have bought the property . Pictured is the swimming pool at the luxury villa, which Eto'o can look forward to using . The mansion has 40 rooms and 30,000 square-metres of land . Samuel Eto'o signed for Sampdoria after he decided to leave Everton during the January transfer window . The property, called Villa Altachiara, was previously owned by Lord Carnarvon, who was known to be jinxed with the ‘Curse of the Pharaoh’. Lord Carnarvon was working with famous English archaeologist Howard Carter when they discovered the tomb of Ancient Egyptian ruler Tutankhamun, opening the ‘cursed’ burial plot on February 16 1923. Famously, of the 58 people present when Tutankhamun’s long-lost tomb was opened, eight died within a dozen years. Working with well-known English archaeologist Howard Carter, Lord Carnarvon made the extraordinary discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, the richest burial site ever found . The feet of the Boy Pharaoh King Tutankhamun is seen in a special glass case inside his tomb in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, Egypt . Mysterious: Lord Carnavon (left), who died in 1923, financed the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb. Pictured right is former Gucci model and heiress Countess Francesca Agusta, who disappeared from the villa in 2001, with her body washing up in near Saint-Tropez three weeks later amid various theories about what happened . Moreover, Lord Carnarvon bizarrely died after he got an infection after cutting a mosquito bite on his face while shaving. In addition, Lord Carnarvon’s nephew died in Villa Altachiara by falling down the stairs, while more recently, in 2001, former Gucci model and heiress Countess Francesca Agusta vanished from the cliff-top property. Those scary stories, however, have not deterred the former Chelsea and Everton man to buy Villa Altachiara. As to the property itself, the mansion has 40 rooms and 30,000 square-metres of land.","Samuel Eto'o has splashed out almost £20million on the Italian villa .
