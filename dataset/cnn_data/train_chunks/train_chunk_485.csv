A car filled with explosives rammed into a U.S. government vehicle in the north-west Pakistani city of Peshawar today, killing three people and wounding 19 others. Two Americans and two Pakistanis working at the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar were among the wounded, according to a U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Two of the dead were Pakistanis. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad had earlier denied initial reports that two Americans were killed in the blast. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: A car filled with explosives rammed into a U.S. government vehicle in the north-west Pakistani city of Peshawar today, killing three and wounding 19 . Peshawar is located near Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal region, the main sanctuary for Taliban and al-Qaida militants in the country. The city has been hit by scores of bombings in recent years, but attacks against American targets are relatively rare, likely because of the extensive security measures taken by the U.S. government. The vehicle was attacked after it left the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar and was travelling through an area of the city that hosts various international organisations, including the United Nations, said police officer Pervez Khan, who was part of the security escort for the vehicle as it moved. Local TV footage showed an SUV at the site that was completely destroyed and burned. All that was left was a carcass of blackened, twisted metal. Officer Khan said the images were of the U.S. vehicle that was attacked. A police explosives expert, Abdul Haq, said 240lbs of explosives were used in the attack. Investigation: The vehicle was attacked after it left the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar and was travelling through an area of the city that hosts various international organisations, including the UN . Security operation: The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad has denied initial reports that two Americans were killed . Irfan Khan, a local resident, was at a nearby shop when the blast occurred. He said: 'I quickly looked back in panic to see smoke and dust erupt from the scene. 'I ran toward the scene along with others and saw two vehicles destroyed and the larger vehicle on fire.' One dead person was on the ground near the SUV, and a foreigner was injured, he said. 'We put the injured man and the dead body in a private vehicle,' said Mr Khan. 'There were more injured in the surrounding area too.' Another eyewitness, Wajid Ali, said he helped put a seriously injured foreigner into the vehicle. But another vehicle arrived, presumably from the U.S. Consulate, and took away the injured foreigners, said Officer Khan. Some of the policemen escorting the U.S. vehicle were also wounded in the attack, and their vehicle was damaged.","Blast happened in north-west Pakistani city of Peshawar today .

Love them or hate them, wood pigeons are starting to rule the roost in towns and cities across the UK. The bigger and hungrier cousin of the urban pigeon is being spotted in gardens in record numbers, with suburban lawns and bird tables particularly favoured. A survey of bird lovers by the British Trust for Ornithology found wood pigeons, which are often accused of stealing food left out for smaller, more fragile birds, to have visited 87 per cent of gardens during a typical week this year. Big eater: The wood pigeon is a big fan of suburban bird tables . This makes them more frequently sighted than robins, great tits or house sparrows. In fact, the wood pigeon, which was once a strictly countryside bird, is developing such an affinity for city life that only blue tits and blackbirds were spotted more frequently. If the trend continues, the wood pigeon could soon rule the roost. Changing agricultural practices - often blamed for the demise of other wildlife - are thought to be behind the population boom. In particular, increased planting of oil seed rape has provided the birds with large quantities of 'fresh greens' to help seem them through the winter. Wood pigeons are more frequently spotted than robins and sparrows . As their numbers have increased, they have ventured more into urban areas, where, safe from farmers who view them as vermin, they appear to have enjoyed the easy pickings on bird tables and in feeders. A spokesman for the BTO said: 'When it comes to gardens, wood pigeons prefer suburbia. Keep out: Use a cage to keep large wood pigeons off your bird table . 'Throughout the year, wood pigeons visit a greater proportion of suburban gardens than rural ones. 'Wood pigeons are persecuted in rural areas as an agricultural pest, so individuals may be more likely to visit suburban gardens, where they feel less threatened. 'Alternatively, bird table fare, which is more widely available in suburban gardens, might be particularly attractive, drawing the birds into gardens.' However, not everyone is happy by the rise of the portly pigeons, which can be distinguished from those more traditionally seen in towns and cities by their bigger bodies and white collars. They have voracious appetites and often hog the bird table, swiftly eating the treats left for smaller birds. The BTO suggests buying seed mixes which are low on cereal, one the wood pigeon's favoured foods. Cages placed around bird tables and feeders will allow access for smaller bird while leaving wood pigeons to forage for themselves. Dr Tim Harrison, of the BTO's Garden BirdWatch project, said: 'Wood pigeons cause ill-feeling amongst some garden bird enthusiasts - it is easy to see just a big stomach on legs. 'But there are things that you can do that mean you can still enjoy them coming into your garden, bringing a sense of the countryside with them.'",Wood pigeons rule the roost in suburban back gardens .

The brother of Moors murder victim Keith Bennett says he is ‘offended and angered’ by claims from a group of paranormal investigators that they may have found killer Ian Brady’s spade. The spade, which has no handle, was reportedly discovered on Saddleworth Moor by members of the Worsley Paranormal Group, which has been searching for Keith’s remains. They claimed to have found it at a spot where they believe Keith is buried. 'Oddballs': Alan Bennett, the brother of Moors murder victim Keith, has hit back at a group of paranormal investigators who claim to have found a spade used by his brother's killer Ian Brady . Tragic: Brady's victim Keith Bennett's body has never been found despite his late mother Winnie's constant efforts . But Keith’s brother Alan Bennett said on an internet forum dedicated to finding Keith’s remains: 'This is complete nonsense as is the Worsley Paranormal Group’s theories and activities. 'They are to be found all over the internet chasing anybody who they think will listen to them. They also post videos claiming to have picked up Keith on a ""ghost box"" machine, all of which I find totally disgusting. 'They know my thoughts on their ""findings"" and when they realised, finally, that I could not take them seriously, they got very angry to the point of being abusive. 'It seems now they, just like the other ""oddballs"" in the news lately, have gone to a newspaper. They have seen their moment to jump on the bandwagon with all the recent publicity about the case. 'This is just another of several spades that have been found on the moor. It is not near any real area of interest to anybody but themselves. I have spoken about these people with the police and we all agreed their ""evidence"" was of the sort that did not warrant further consideration - to put it mildly.' He added: 'I am and will continue to be offended and angered by these people.' Keith’s mother Winnie Johnson, who died last month, fought a long campaign to get Brady to reveal the location of her son’s body. A senior lecturer in forensic analytical science at the University of Manchester has examined the spade but said he had been unable to discover its origin as it was ‘very corroded’. Justice for Winnie: Keith's mother Winnie Johnson died on August 18 after a long-term illness without discovering the location of her son's remains . Funeral: Mr Bennett, left, hugs a mourner at his mother Winnie's funeral after her coffin is carried into St Chrysostom's Church, in Victoria Park, Manchester . Forensic expert, Steve Kershaw, Senior Lecturer in Forensic Analytical Science at the University of Manchester told the . BBC: 'Even if we had lots more time and even if we had established that . it was a spade from the 60s or pre-dated the 60s, we would not have . necessarily established if it was anything to do with Ian Brady. 'The only way we would have been able to . tell is if it had DNA on it and that is harder to tell with the handle . gone (and) it being so corroded. Although some vegetation has survived (on it), there is very little chance of DNA having survived.' Mr Bennett added: 'This ""find"" is of no help to us. A spade may well have been found again, but it does not tie in with any of the other information or evidence we have relating to Keith. Killers: Keith Bennett was abducted and murdered by Ian Brady, left, and Myra Hindley, right, in 1964 . 'Their need for publicity and their . desperation to get anyone to listen to them is evident from their . pursuit of various individuals, usually as uninformed or as crass as themselves, on the internet.' Claims emerged last month that Brady had . penned a letter - not to be opened until after his death - to Winnie . that revealed details of Keith's burial spot on the moor. Police launched an investigation and . arrested Brady's mental health advocate Jackie Powell but the letter has . not been found and detectives believe it may have been a ruse by the . killer.","Spade with no handle reportedly discovered on Saddleworth Moor by members of Worsley Paranormal Group .

The father-of-two, who walks with two canes and suffers from high blood pressure, lost his balance as he stepped off a train and stumbled across the platform. Danger: Benigno Nazario lost his balance on a Times Square subway platform and fell onto the tracks . 'He turned over and fell onto the tracks,' Mrs Nazario told the New York Post. 'I was screaming, ""Help!"" I thought he was going to die.’ But Nazario's life was miraculously spared as an express train shot over him, because of the small cavity into which he had fallen. He lay wedged there, inches from an electrified rail, as the train's operator slammed on the brakes and brought it to a stop partly over his body. Rescue workers rushed to his aid and he was pulled from beneath the train still conscious, taking him to Belluvue hospital.

Turkey has heavily criticised the UN for not acting more strongly against the Syrian regime as it appealed for more action to help people forced to flee their homes. The Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu appealed to a reluctant U.N. Security Council for a safe haven for thousands of Syrians facing a 'humanitarian disaster'. It came as Britain and France said they would rule out no options - including a no-fly zone - to aid residents fleeing the escalating and violent civil war. Deadly: A member of the Free Syrian Army is pictured lying down on a bed next to weapons in Aleppo. It comes as Turkey has heavily criticised the UN for not acting more strongly against the Syrian regime . Turkish leaders, however, held out little hope yesterday for the endorsement of a deeply divided council that has been paralysed on taking action to stop the 18-month uprising which has killed more than 20,000 people. Davutoglu said: 'How long are we going to sit and watch while an entire generation is being wiped out by random bombardment and deliberate mass targeting?' 'Let's not forget that if we do not act against such a crime against humanity happening in front of our eyes, we become accomplices to the crime.' Davutoglu, whose country is hosting more than 80,000 Syrian refugees, said he came to the council with hope that its members would take 'long overdue steps' to help suffering people and establish camps inside Syria for those forced to flee their homes. Wants action: Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu appealed to a reluctant U.N. Security Council for a safe haven for thousands of Syrians facing a 'humanitarian disaster' 'Apparently, I was wrong about my expectations,' he told the council. 'This meeting will not even end with a presidential or press statement, let alone a robust resolution.' The path to the council's agreement on a safe zone for Syrians is fraught with obstacles, headed by the reluctance of Russia and China, Syria's most important allies. They have vetoed three Western-backed resolutions in the Security Council seeking to pressure President Bashar Assad's government with the threat of sanctions. Moscow and Beijing were highly critical of the no-fly zone established by NATO to protect civilians during last year's Libyan revolt against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, saying its enforcement went beyond the Security Council mandate. Western diplomats said enforcing the zone required taking out Libya's air defences and attacking tanks and military vehicles that posed threats to civilians. Russia and China, Syria's most important allies, have vetoed three Western-backed resolutions in the Security Council seeking to pressure Assad's government. They vehemently oppose any threat to Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition, Russia has a military base in Syria. Helping out: Turkey already has more than 80,000 Syrian refugees. This is a refugee camp in the Turkish border town of Yayladagi in Hatay province, Turkey . There are also serious political . differences among council members. While the U.S., its European allies . and other members say Assad must go, Russia and China oppose any effort . to replace him that doesn't have the support of the Syrian people. Syria's . U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari accused unnamed Security Council powers . of 'promoting imminent military intervention under humanitarian . pretexts.' 'It is . clear that certain states do not see the issue of humanitarian aid any . way other than as part of a biased political agenda,' he said. Before . Thursday's meeting, Britain and France announced new funding for . refugees and left open the possibility of more aggressive action, . including a military-enforced no-fly zone to protect a safe area for . those fleeing the war. 'We are not ruling out any options for the future,' Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague told a news conference. Firm: Foreign Secretary William Hague, left, has said Britain would rule out no options - including a no-fly zone - to aid residents fleeing the escalating and violent civil war. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is pictured right . Hague said safe zones should remain an option, although he didn't say when they might be seriously considered. 'We . do not know how this crisis will develop ... over the coming months. It . is steadily getting worse,' Hague said. 'We are ruling nothing out, and . we have contingency planning for a wide range of scenarios.' Britain . and France are veto-wielding members of the Security Council as well as . key NATO members. Asked whether the options would include a . NATO-enforced no-fly zone, without Security Council authorization, Hague . said, 'We are not ruling out any options.' A U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the U.S. had consultations with Turkey on its safe zone proposal and the Americans, British and French are skeptical about the feasibility of NATO establishing such a zone, so 'for the time being, nobody is there yet.' In his speech, the Turkish minister told the council that that the camps established for fleeing Syrians inside the country 'should have full protection.' Grim: Smoke rises from an explosion in Aleppo's city centre yesterday . Davutoglu also called on the council . to visit refugee camps in neighboring countries, to adopt a unified . response to stop the indiscriminate bombing of residential areas, and to . solve the issue of Syrians displaced from their homes and trapped . within the country. Davutoglu . mentioned examples of 'the cost of procrastination' including the 1995 . Serb massacre in Bosnia of more than 8,000 Muslims taken from a U.N. enclave in Srebrenica and Saddam Hussein's gassing of 5,000 people in . the Kurdish village of Halabja in 1988. Referring to the council divisions, Davutoglu said the Cold War is over and it's time to put aside the mindset, 'sterile power struggles and competition of interests' emanating from that era. U.N. refugee chief Antonio Guterres warned the council against safe zones. He praised Syria's neighbors for keeping their borders open to Syrians fleeing the war, and said their right to asylum 'must not be jeopardized, for instance through the establishment of so-called ""safe havens"" or other similar arrangements.' 'Bitter experience has shown that it is rarely possible to provide effective protection and security in such areas,' Guterres said. War torn: A Syrian opposition fighter takes position during a battle against government forces in Aleppo . Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly . Churkin strongly criticized unilateral U.S. and European Union sanctions . against Syria, saying they worsened the plight of the Syrian people, . and he agreed with Guterres' skepticism about safe zones. 'He . made it very clear he thought that history showed that they cannot be . relied on as an effective tool for protecting civilians - that we must . work together in order to help alleviate and improve the humanitarian . situation for the entire population of Syria,' Churkin said. China's U.N. Ambassador Li Baodong, asked about the Turkish proposal by AP, said: 'I think that's not a solution. The solution is to implement a cease-fire, cessation of violence, and implementation of a political process.' 'Humanitarian efforts must never be militarized,' Li told the council meeting. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said more than 2.5 million people - including Palestinian and Iraqi refugees - 'are now in grave need of assistance and protection inside Syria,' more than double the number reported in March. Guterres, the U.N. refugee chief, said as of Wednesday, 229,000 people had left Syria and registered as refugees in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. He said the U.N. humanitarian appeal for Syria seeking $180 million is only half-funded. Hague announced that Britain will contribute an additional £3 million ($4.7 million), to the £27 million  ($42.7 million) it has already given for humanitarian aid to the displaced and to refugees. Fabius announced that France was giving 5 million Euros ($6.27 million) in addition to the $20 million Euros ($25 million) it has already contributed.","Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu appealed to the UN for a safe haven for thousands of Syrians facing a 'humanitarian disaster'

"Judge declares children are in 'terrific hands' saying Katherine has done a 'wonderful job' Arrangement to be finalised later this month . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:09 EST, 2 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:06 EST, 2 August 2012 . A judge has reinstated Katherine Jackson as the guardian of Michael Jackson's three children today in an arrangement that also keeps their cousin as temporary co-guardian. Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said during a hearing that an investigator who looked into the children's care found that the late pop star's 82-year-old mother was an excellent guardian and the children love her very much. 'I think the kids are in terrific hands,' the judge said. 'It appears from the report that Katherine Jackson has done a wonderful job and cares about the children very much.' Getting her grandchildren back: Katherine Jackson is set to become a co-guardian of Blanket, Paris and Prince after recently having her sole guardianship temporarily rescinded . Sharing the load: TJ Jackson will share guardianship of his young cousins with his grandmother . Beckloff noted that the children, . Prince, 15, Paris, 14 and Blanket, 10, also have a close relationship . with their 34-year-old cousin TJ Jackson, who was named co-guardian . after working closely with Katherine Jackson since Michael Jackson died. TJ is 'incredibly respectful' of the family matriarch and she is respectful of him, the judge said. Beckloff said he will finalise the . arrangement later in the month but for now he will issue letters of . co-guardianship allowing both Jacksons to make decisions about the . children's welfare. The shared guardianship plan is . apparently designed to remove pressure from Katherine Jackson who was . previously named in her son's will as the children's sole guardian. Perry Sanders Jr., her lawyer, has . said the arrangement will allow his client to focus on the children's . upbringing and not on home or logistics issues. TJ Jackson was appointed temporary . guardian in a court hearing last week after a bizarre episode in which . Katherine Jackson was reported missing but later turned up at an Arizona . spa with family members. Beckloff said last week that he . didn't believe Jackson had done anything wrong but suspended her . guardianship duties because she had been out of contact with her . grandchildren for 10 days. The changes in guardianship come on . the heels of family dissension over Michael Jackson's will, which left . nothing to his siblings when he died three years ago. Family war: Jermaine, Janet and Randy Jackson were some of the family members involved in a plot to challenge the will of their late brother Michael, although Jermaine has now withdrew his support . Several of them signed a letter that . was leaked to the media alleging the will was a fake and calling on . executors of the estate to resign. The dispute at one point led to a . driveway confrontation involving several family members at the Calabasas . mansion where Katherine Jackson and the children have been living. Close: Michael appointed Diana Ross as the back up guardian for his three children in the event of his death so she has to sign off custody arrangements . On Wednesday, Jermaine Jackson issued a plea for peace in the family and withdrew his support of the letter. 'Mistakes have been made and . irrational things have been said on both sides in a highly charged . emotional environment,' Jermaine Jackson wrote. 'It is time for us all . to draw a line in the sand and move toward peace, co-operation, love and . healing.' He wrote that the family is still raw . from Michael Jackson's death, and his mother has endured incredible . stress and pressures since then. Another party to the Jackson family . drama, singer Diana Ross, who was named by Michael Jackson in his will . as a potential guardian of the children if Katherine Jackson was not . available, issued a statement saying the recent turmoil is a private . matter and shouldn't be playing out publicly. Ross and Jackson were longtime . friends before his death in 2009. She has been given notice of court . proceedings, but the new agreement apparently will relieve her of any . possible guardianship duties, specifying that Katherine and TJ Jackson . could replace each other if one or the other became unavailable to . serve. Addressing his fans: Jermaine posted the statement on his Twitter page this week, a day after he wrote that his family 'would heal' We're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable.","Judge declares children are in 'terrific hands' saying Katherine has done a 'wonderful job'

Silvio Berlusconi watched girls dressed as nuns strip and perform a pole dance, a court heard yesterday. The former Italian premier claims his bunga-bunga parties were ‘convivial dinners, with wine, food, talking and singing’. But yesterday a young woman invited along to one of the notorious gatherings spoke of her shock at what she saw. Scroll down for video . Imane Fadil (left) said women had dressed in AC Milan football kits and that she went to Berlusconi's (right) parties in the hope of securing a job for one of his TV channels . Model Imane Fadil, 27, was giving evidence at the trial of Berlusconi on sex and abuse of office charges. Miss Fadil also described how girls in AC Milan football kits undressed to their G-strings while another pair performed an erotic dance. Dozens of other young women are due to testify, as well as actor George Clooney and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. Iris Beradi (pictured) dressed as Ronaldinho during one party - that is until she stripped to nothing but a G string . Miss Fadil said that she had attended the parties – held in the basement of Berlusconi’s villa – in the hope of securing a job as a presenter on one of the media mogul’s TV channels. Girls were apparently recruited by regional councillor Nicole Minetti, 26, a member of his political party, and paid to dance for him and his cronies. Miss Fadil told the hearing in Milan of an evening in February 2010 at the villa in nearby Arcore. She said: ‘I saw Nicole Minetti and Barbara Fagioli [another guest] dressed in black tunics, wearing white headcaps and a crucifix and then they stripped off … and were left just in their underwear. ‘Another evening some of the girls were wearing AC Milan shirts. One girl, Iris Berardi, was dressed as [player] Ronaldinho … and she danced until she was left wearing a G-string.’ Miss Fadil said that the girls touched themselves and also allowed Berlusconi, 75, to touch them. She added: ‘I went to the  parties because Berlusconi had promised me a job. I was shocked with what I saw.’ Miss Fadil said every time she went to a party there had been ‘guests taking their clothes off’. She recalled one where TV hopefuls Roberta Nigra and Lisa Barizonte were dancing. Miss Fadil said: ‘Lisa removed Roberta’s underwear, they then both began touching each other. Then Nicole got involved.’ She said that she had been given envelopes of cash but never stayed the night – though other women were very willing to do so. Miss Fadil also revealed how Berlusconi showed guests a crude video of a former ally Gianfranco Fini who he had a bitter falling out with, sitting on a toilet adding: 'I have not spoken about this before because I was scared. He had it on an iPad in his office and Berlusconi made comments which were not very nice.' Berlusconi has always denied anything untoward happened at the bunga bunga parties and insisted that they were 'convivial dinners, with wine, food, talking and singing' - although prosecutors insist the women were paid in return for sex and one of them was then 17 year old Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug. During one of the parties, Iris Beradi (left) dressed as Ronaldinho and it is also alleged that 17-year-old Moroccan belly dancer Karima El Mahroug (right) was paid for sex during the bunga bunga parties . Berlusconi is accused of having sex with Miss El Mahroug - in Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying for sex with a women under 18 is seen as prostitution with a minor. Both he and Miss El Mahroug, who also goes by the name Ruby the Heartstealer deny the charge. Besides the sex charge with Miss El Mahroug, Berlusconi is accused of abusing his office by using his influence as prime minister to have her released from custody after she was arrested by police for theft in May 2010. He is said to have wrongly told police in Milan that she was related to then then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and should be released so as to avoid a diplomatic incident. Miss Fadil also told the court that she had heard Miss El Mahroug had a 'compromising video' of Berlusconi, rumours of which have been circulating in Italy for several months but which as yet has not surfaced. Though she told the court she did not stay after being offered the cash-stuffed envelope, Miss Fadil described how other women were more than willing to spend the night with Berlusconi and said: 'Several women were paid to have sex - there was a woman called Joanna and another from Guatemala. 'Those that spent the night were paid more and the girls were willing to do anything to stay there. It was all organised by Nicole Minetti.' Last week it was revealed that Berlusconi had given Miss Minetti £50,000 towards her legal fees while he has also given a further £150,000 to twins Imma and Eleonora De Vivo who had been regular guests at the parties but he insisted the money were 'transparent loans.' Miss Fadil also described to the court how Berlusconi had asked the Moroccan born model for diplomatic advice on dealing with dead Libyan despot Colonel Gaddafi. She said:'I told him that the best thing to do would be to go and see Gaddafi as we Arabs can be a bit touchy. He also asked me about AC Milan (football club Berlusconi owns) and he said ""What are we missing?"" I told him a strong young player.' The trial continues.

"By . Paul Revoir and Liz Thomas . UPDATED: . 03:46 EST, 2 February 2012 . Pay cut? Alan Hansen is going to broker a deal to saty on Match Of The Day . Match of The Day’s team of highly paid pundits are facing drastic reductions in their salaries as part of the BBC’s economy drive. Alan Hansen has agreed to take a £500,000-a-year pay cut when he signs his new contract in the next few days. And it is understood that Alan Shearer, Mark Lawrenson and Lee Dixon – along with presenter Gary Lineker – will also face salary reductions when they discuss new deals. Hansen’s pay has been the subject of controversy after it was revealed he was earning £1.5million a year for his comments. £500,000 would represent a 33 per cent pay cut. Sources have suggested that the former Scotland international ‘voluntarily’ agreed to the reduction, saying that he was no different from Sir Bruce Forsyth  or Graham Norton in having to ‘stomach’ big salary drops. They said he ‘didn’t complain’ and was keen to stay on, adding that compared with most people in the industry he was still ‘on a very good deal’. It is understood that Lineker, who is thought to be on about £2million, does not come up for contract renewal until August next year. Again it is expected he will follow suit with a significant reduction to his deal. The other pundits are expected to face cuts of about 20 per cent because they are paid less – Shearer is believed to be on £500,000 a year. Under fire: As the BBC is forced to make slashing cuts to its budgets stars of prime time shows have come under scrutiny for their huge salaries . Career: Hansen may have used his reputation on the field, which included 26 Scotland caps and three European Cup wins, to justify his earnings (pictured playing for Liverpool in 1970s) The revelation that Hansen was receiving about £40,000 per show angered viewers and politicians. BBC director general Mark Thompson has tried to defend the deal by comparing Hansen to top TV entertainers of the past, such as Morecambe and Wise. But it would appear there is a growing realisation that defending such high pay is hard to sustain when the BBC is facing 20 per cent cuts and getting rid of about 2,000 jobs. A source said: ‘On-screen talent is not immune to economic pressures facing the BBC.’ Life for Hansen, Lawrenson and Shearer has been made easier with Match Of The Day’s recent move  to Salford. Both Hansen and Lawrenson live in the North West, while Shearer’s home is in the North East, although it is less convenient for Lineker, who is based in the South East. Not alone: Jeremy Paxman and Graham Norton have also been asked to take pay cuts in cost cutting measures .",BBC confirm former Scotland international will take a 'considerable' cut to his £1.5m salary .

Perhaps it was a question of bear necessity, as one furry felon was filmed breaking into a sweet shop no less than seven times in 15 minutes to grab a host of sugary treats. The smarter than average bear, who could have given Yogi and his mate Boo Boo a run for their money, pawed his way through the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store in Estes Park, Colorado to find his favourite candies. These apparently include English toffee,  chocolate-chip cookies dipped in caramel and milk chocolate appropriately named 'cookie bears'. Scroll down to watch the hilarious video . Bear with paw-pose: The young animal makes his way through the front door and over to the counter of the sweet shop . Amazingly, the cheeky thief used the front door and didn't break a thing during the daylight raid. But once inside, the young black bear behaved, well, just like any other kid in a candy store. Cautious at first, he simply grabbed the candy nearest to the registers, duly carried them outside and ate them. The sweet-toothed mammal then grew braver and returned to the shop another seven times for more, only leaving when a passing car scared him away. Store owner Jo Adams said the bear managed to pop open the door, because the deadbolt was not completely secured. The only evidence that her sneaky visitor left behind was some dirt on a counter and paper on the ground. There weren't even any wrappers left, so she assumes he ate those too. 'He was very clean and very careful. He ate a lot of candy,' said Adams of the bear break-in, which was first reported by the Estes Park News. Sweet thing: The smell of candies lured the cheeky thief seven times into the Colorado shop . Pick 'n' mix: The discerning candy connoisseur selects which sweet treat he would like next . Bear with me: Trying to stand, the furry felon takes a look at the whole selection . Pawfect: The thief finds what he's looking for shortly before scampering off with his haul . Bears looking for leftover food are often sighted sniffing around people's homes, cars and street rubbish in Colorado's mountain towns, including Estes Park, which is the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park. But an ongoing drought this year has made the resourceful animals even more brazen in their search for food. The 'store owner added: 'We're in their turf, and you just put up with these things when they happen.' Watch video here: .","Cheeky animal broke into store seven times in 15 minutes to grab treats .

The mother of Michael Jackson said in court papers she was kept from communicating with outsiders while at a resort in Tucson and was unaware she had been reported missing. Katherine Jackson declared in the documents obtained Thursday that she had no idea she was the subject of a search until she accidentally heard a television report. She said she was told her doctor had ordered her to rest and she was flown to Arizona. At a spa, her cell phone was confiscated along with her iPad and she said she was kept in a room with no working phone or TV service. Cut off: Katherine . Jackson, pictured in November, said she was planning to travel by . motorhome to see her sons perform in New Mexico on July 14 when she was . advised to fly instead, and ended up in Arizona . She said she asked about Michael's children and was told they were fine. According to documents obtained by RadarOnline, Mrs Jackson said she was planning to travel by motorhome to . see her sons perform in New Mexico on July 14 when she was advised by a . doctor she should fly instead. Radar reports Mrs Jackson recalled the . doctor arrived to her door 'stating he had been in contact with my . longtime personal physician and was coming to check on me because my . personal physician was unavailable.' She continued: 'The doctor advised . that it was better for me to fly and not drive to New Mexico. Believing . that the doctor was sent at the request of my longtime personal . physician, I followed what I understood to be a doctor's orders and . boarded a flight as opposed to driving in the motorhome.' Getting . her grandchildren back: Mrs Jackson is set to become a . co-guardian of Blanket, far left, Paris, second from left, and Prince, centre, after recently having her sole . guardianship temporarily rescinded . Instead, . she was flown to Miraval Spa in Tucson. However, the matriarch did not . specify who accompanied her there nor did she say who sent the doctor to . her home. Sharing the load: TJ Jackson will share guardianship of his young cousins with his grandmother . The disclosure marked the latest . development in a series of events that began when Katherine Jackson was . reported missing last month but later turned up at the spa with family . members. The documents were released after a . judge reinstated Katherine Jackson as the guardian of the children in an . arrangement that also keeps their cousin as temporary co-guardian. Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff . said during a hearing that an investigator who looked into the . children's care found that the late pop star's 82-year-old mother was an . excellent guardian and the children love her very much. 'I think the kids are in terrific . hands,' the judge said. 'It appears from the report that Katherine . Jackson has done a wonderful job and cares about the children very . much.' Beckloff noted that the children, . Prince, 15, Paris, 14 and Blanket, 10, also have a close relationship . with their 34-year-old cousin TJ Jackson, who was named temporary . guardian last week after working closely with Katherine Jackson since . Michael Jackson died. TJ is 'incredibly respectful' of the family matriarch and she is respectful of him, the judge said. Beckloff said he will finalize the . arrangement later in the month but for now will issue letters of . co-guardianship allowing both Jacksons to make decisions about the . children's welfare. TJ Jackson's new co-guardianship . status is temporary, but the judge could make it permanent when he . convenes the next court hearing on August 22. The shared guardianship plan is . apparently designed to remove pressure from Katherine Jackson who was . previously named in her son's will as the children's sole guardian. On the contrary: Mrs Jackson was surrounded last month by Janet, . Jermaine, Rebbie and Rebbie's daughter - along with a manager . for the resort where was staying - to quell rumours she was held . against her will . Emotional: Mrs Jackson read a statement claiming she was 'devastated' to lose custody and said she had been on a 'short vacation', contrary to her deposition . Perry Sanders Jr, her lawyer, has said . the arrangement will allow his client to focus on the children's . upbringing and not on home or logistics issues. Beckloff said then that he didn't . believe Jackson had done anything wrong but suspended her guardianship . duties because she had been out of contact with her grandchildren for 10 . days. Close: . Diana Ross was named by Michael Jackson in his will as a potential guardian of the children . The changes in guardianship come on . the heels of family dissension over Michael Jackson's will, which left . nothing to his siblings when he died three years ago. Several of them . signed a letter that was leaked to the media alleging the will was a . fake and calling on executors of the estate to resign. The . dispute at one point led to a driveway confrontation involving several . family members at the Calabasas mansion where Katherine Jackson and the . children have been living. On Wednesday, Jermaine Jackson issued a plea for peace in the family and withdrew his support of the letter. 'Mistakes have been made and . irrational things have been said on both sides in a highly charged . emotional environment,' Jermaine Jackson wrote. 'It is time for us all . to draw a line in the sand and move toward peace, co-operation, love and . healing.' He wrote that the family is still raw . from Michael Jackson's death, and his mother has endured incredible . stress and pressures since then. Next steps: Lawyers acting on behalf of the Jackson family and estate spoke about the latest hearing in Los Angeles today . Another party to the Jackson family . drama, singer Diana Ross, who was named by Michael Jackson in his will . as a potential guardian of the children if Katherine Jackson was not . available, issued a statement saying the recent turmoil is a private . matter and shouldn't be playing out publicly. Legend: Michael Jackson, pictured in May 2005, left a reported $1billion legacy to his children . Ross and Jackson were longtime friends before his death in 2009. Ross, who lives on the East Coast, . came to California to visit with the Jackson family on Wednesday, . Katherine Jackson's lawyer said, adding the singer supports the . co-guardianship arrangement. She has been given notice of court . proceedings, but the new agreement apparently will relieve her of any . possible guardianship duties, specifying that Katherine and TJ Jackson . could replace each other if one or the other became unavailable to . serve. Mr Sanders told RadarOnline: 'Ms Ross . met with Katherine, and the children yesterday. It was a very thoughtful . and pleasant meeting. Ms. Ross had no issues with signing off on the . proposed new custody agreement.' Meanwhile, Mrs Jackson's declaration . directly contradicts statements she made in an ABC News interview, in . which she said she voluntarily cut off communication with the outside . world. With her children Jermaine, Rebbie, . and Janet - and the marketing manager of the resort where she was . staying - the matriarch tried to explain: 'One reason I didn't call is I . just gave up my phone and I didn't want to have any phone calls while I . was here.'","Declared in court documents to regain guardianship she was scheduled to take a road trip on July 14 but a doctor advised she fly instead .

A huge fire that engulfed a Falmouth hotel forcing Blur guitarist Graham Coxon to flee has left the building a smouldering shell. Around 30 guests, including Coxon, were evacuated from the Best Western Falmouth Beach Hotel in Falmouth, Cornwall yesterday after the blaze broke out. Twelve unaccounted for guests - thought to have gone on day trips - have all been found safe and well, Devon and Cornwall police said. A spokesman said they did not think there were any suspicious circumstances surrounding the blaze, although the investigation continues. Scroll down for video . Gone: The raging fire engulfed every room of the Best Western Falmouth Beach Hotel in Cornwall reducing it to a shell . Battle: More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze that started just after noon yesterday . Long day: A police officer holds on to his hat while the the fire rages on behind him, left, and right, offers some information to panicking residents . Performer: Guitarist Graham Coxon was due to perform in Falmouth during a solo tour before being caught up in the fire drama . Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said the alarm was raised just after noon yesterday and more than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze. At its height, 10 appliances and two aerial platforms fought the fire at the 120-bedroom hotel - one of the biggest in Falmouth. Firefighters' efforts to control the fire were hampered by strong winds which fanned the flames, allowing the fire to spread throughout the building, causing the roof to collapse. Alternative accommodation had to be found for 30 people from the Falmouth Beach Hotel, plus 100 guests at the neighbouring St Michael's Hotel. It took firefighters more than seven hours to bring the fire under control, but crews remained at the hotel last night damping down hot spots. Guitarist Coxon was due to perform at the town's Princess Pavilion venue last night. On Twitter he said: 'We have rooms at the beach hotel and had to leave when the smell of smoke.' He later added: 'We watched it... We had to leave the foyer and then watch it get worse and worse..rather sad.' The family-run Falmouth Beach Hotel, which opened in 1984, became part of the Best Western group of hotels in 2000. A Best Western spokesman said hotel accommodation had been found within Falmouth for people who were due to stay at the Falmouth Beach this week. Onlookers: Crowds gathered at the Falmouth Beach Hotel in Cornwall as the flames ripped through the building . The hotel's event coordinator had also begun to contact couples who were due to celebrate their weddings, the spokesperson added.

Next month Falmouth is due to host the Finn Cup sailing competition and is one of the towns to welcome the Olympic Torch on the first day of its relay throughout the UK. A Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'The scene is still being monitored, the crew are monitoring hot spots and damping down. 'A fire investigation will be taking place later this morning.

The Vietnamese government on Monday agreed to open three new sites in the country for excavation by the United States to search for troop remains from the war, the minister of defense told U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta during a meeting there. The announcement came as Panetta and Vietnam Defense Minister Phung Quang Thanh exchanged long-held artifacts collected during the war — including letters written by a U.S. soldier who was killed that had been kept and used as propaganda, and a small maroon diary belonging to a Vietnamese soldier. A U.S. service member took the journal back to the U.S. During a press briefing, where the two defense chiefs formally handed over the papers, both said their countries want to work together, whether or not the expanded relationship bothers China. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta (left) shakes hands with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Hanoi . Beijing has expressed concern over America's new defense strategy that puts more focus on the Asia-Pacific region, including plans to increase the number of troops, ships and other military assets in the region. Speaking through an interpreter, Thanh said Vietnam wants to continue defense cooperation with all countries, including stable and longstanding relationships with China and the United States. Hanoi, he said, would not sacrifice relations with one country for another. Panetta said the U.S. goal is to help strengthen the capabilities of countries across the region.

'Frankly the most destabilizing situation would be if we had a group of weak nations and only the United States and China were major powers in this region,' said Panetta.

Defense officials reviewing the . packet of papers given to Panetta said it appears there are three sets . of letters, including a set from the soldier, U.S. Army Sgt. Steve . Flaherty, who was from Columbia, S.C. It was not clear how many other . service members' letters were there, but officials were going through . them Monday. Officials said this is the first time . such a joint exchange of war artifacts has occurred. The two defense . leaders agreed to return the papers to the families of the deceased . soldiers. During the meeting with Panetta, . Vietnamese officials said they would open the three previously . restricted sites that the Pentagon believes are critical to locating . troops missing in action. Ron Ward, U.S. casualty resolution . specialist at the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command in Hanoi, said there . are at least four U.S. troops believed to be lost in the three areas . that were opened by the Vietnamese Monday. With those three areas now . open, Ward said there are now just eight sites left that are still . restricted by the Vietnamese.

US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta (left) and Vietnamese Defence Minister General Phung Quang Thanh exchange memorial documents from wartimes . Military officers briefing Panetta at the command's office said they had five to seven years to complete their excavation work. The acidic soil in Vietnam erodes bones quickly, leaving in many cases only teeth for the military teams to use to try and identify service members, one of the team members said. In addition, many of the potential witnesses with information about remains are getting older and their memories are fading. There are about nearly 1,300 cases that are still unaccounted for, and officers briefing Panetta said about 600 of those remains could be recoverable. Last week, Patricia O'Grady, daughter of a Vietnam veteran  found what she believes are the remains of her father who went missing when plane was shot down. He was ejected from the seat and parachuted into the dense jungle close to the tiny village of Y Leng and O'Grady has spent decades trying to find out what happened to him. The 59-year-old traveled to a small village near the Ho Chi Minh trail after locals unearthed a jaw with teeth and dog tags from a grave site they say belonged to Major John F. O'Grady. Two former members of the North Vietnamese army guided her up a hard-packed red clay mountain and through craggy jungle to the spot they buried the soldier, 45 years before. O'Grady waited for them to dig up her father. But Vietnamese and U.S. authorities were not happy she was there, even threatening her with arrest if she didn't leave the area. Now she is battling with the authorities to be allowed to bring the remains home and says she will not leave until she is successful. Ward said that opening the three new sites will enable the U.S. to try and find: . Two Air Force members who were lost when their plane was shot down in Quang Binh Province in central Vietnam in 1967. An Army private first class who went . missing when he was out with his unit on a search-and-destroy mission in . 1968 in the tri-border area of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. A Marine who was on a surface-to-air . combat mission and was lost when his plane went down in Quang Tri . Province. Another Marine on the plane ejected and was rescued. Flaherty, who was with the 101st . Airborne, was killed in the northern section of South Vietnam in March . 1969. According to defense officials, Vietnamese forces took his letters . and used them in broadcasts during the war. Vietnamese Col. Nguyen Phu Dat kept . the letters, but it was not until last August, when he mentioned them in . an online publication, that they started to come to light. Early this year, Robert Destatte, a retired Defense Department employee who had worked for the POW/MIA office, noticed the online publication, and the Pentagon began to work to get the letters back to Flaherty's family. The small diary belonged to Vu Dinh Doan, a Vietnamese soldier who was found killed in a machine gun fight, according to defense officials. Officials said that a Marine, Robert ""Ira"" Frazure of Walla Walla, Wash., saw the diary — with a photo and some money inside — on the chest of the dead soldier and took it back to the U.S. The diary came to light earlier this year when the sister of a friend of Frazure's was doing research for a book and Frazure asked her help in returning the diary. The sister, Marge Scooter, brought the diary to the PBS television program History Detectives. The show then asked the Defense and State departments to help return the diary.

"By . Chris Slack . UPDATED: . 08:47 EST, 7 October 2011 . Hundreds of Afghans took to the streets of the nation's capital Kabul today to demand the withdrawal of military forces ahead of the tenth anniversary of the U.S. invasion. The demonstration in the centre of the city was peaceful but many of the participants wore masks or veils to hide their faces and a Stars and Stripes was later burned openly in the street. The protest was staged to mark the October 7 invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, which followed less than a month after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers . Protest: Hundreds of Afghans took to the streets of Kabul today on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the invasion to demonstrate against the occupation of the country . Chants: A woman uses a megaphone to shout slogans including 'no to occupation' and 'Americans out'. The protesters also carried posters of victims of the conflict . Anger: This group of Afghan men shout anti-US chants during the protest. A group of those involved later burned the American flag . The Americans went in when Taliban . leader Mullah Omar refused to hand over Osama Bin Laden because he . didn't believe he was behind the atrocity. The U.S. has subsequently lost more than 1,700 servicemen and women and injected around $18bn into economy, making Afghanistan the biggest recipient of aid from the country. The war has also cost the lives of . 2,749 military personnel in total, including 1,798 from the United . States, 382 from the UK and 569 from other nations. There are currently more than 130,000 troops in Afghanistan, with about 98,000 from the United States. The foreign aid has been spent on . creating projects in a bid to stabilise the country and in an attempt to . win the 'hearts and minds' of the population. Project: An Afghan labourer chops firewood in a yard in one of the schemes the U.S. has set up in the country. Washington has injected $18.8bn into the country in the past decade . Briefing: Staff Sergeant Brandon Shaffer, fourth right, speaks to his platoon before they go on patrol in the east of Afghanistan. The soldiers are part of 130,000 U.S. military personnel in the country . Even . today the International Monetary Fund has reached an agreement with the . Afghan government for a further $129m loan, which will be confirmed . next month. The demo, organised by a small left wing political party, saw protesters chant 'no to occupation' and 'Americans out' as they marched through the streets holding pictures of Afghans killed . in violence. Speaking about the protest, a 22-year-old woman known only as Farzana said: 'The . United States said it came to help the Afghan people and provide a good . life to Afghan people, but their true purpose was to occupy our . country. 'It is 10 years since the invasion of Afghanistan and all it has left behind is the blood of the Afghan people. We want the U.S. to leave our country.' She added that 'suicide attacks, insecurity and corruption are increasing day-by-day.' Elsewhere in the country a child and man were killed after insurgents opened fire on a civilian bus travelling in the Girisk district of Helmand province. And in southern Uruzgan province, a . car bomb killed the commander of a highway security force, Wali Jan, as . he walked out of his home, the police said. A Danish soldier was also seriously wounded by an explosive device . during an operation in south-western Afghanistan after a blast close to the Danish base in Helamd province. The Danish Army Operational Command says the soldier was taken by helicopter to a field hospital for treatment. Denmark, which has about 750 soldiers in Afghanistan, will begin withdrawing them this year and gradually shift its role to the training of Afghan forces. International forces have begun handing over responsibly for security to Afghan forces and all foreign combat troops are to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Talks: Defence Secretary Liam Fox, left, and his American counterpart Leon Panetta attended a Nato meeting today to discuss the transition in Afghanistan after 2014 . President Obama announced in July that he would pull 10,000 troops out of Afghanistan this year and 23,000 more by next September. Meanwhile, Pakistan has warned Afghanistan to behave responsibly following Kabul's move to sign a strategic pact with India, at a particularly sensitive time in relations between the two countries. Afghanistan's interior minister recently accused Pakistan's powerful spy agency, the ISI, of being involved in last month's suicide bombing in Kabul that killed former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani - an allegation denied by Pakistan. 'At this defining stage when challenges have multiplied, as have the opportunities, it is our expectation that everyone, especially those in position of authority in Afghanistan, will demonstrate requisite maturity and responsibility,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tehmina Janjua told reporters. 'This is no time for point-scoring, playing politics or grandstanding.' Pact: Afghan president Hamid Karzai, left, shakes hands with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after the pair agreed to share details on a number of common areas . Her comments seemed more confrontational than Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's statement which said that Afghanistan and India have the right to maintain bilateral relations as sovereign nations. The agreement, which was signed on Tuesday, outlined areas of common concern including trade, economic expansion, education, security and politics. It was the first of its kind between Afghanistan and any country. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, subject of a foiled assassination plot uncovered this week - has tried to assuage concern over the pact, saying it was not intended as an aggressive move against Pakistan.

When notorious mafia boss Michele Zagaria was seized from a secret bunker by police last December after 16 years on the run,  jubilant police could be seen cheering and making the V-sign. Now it appears the threat posed by the gangster who is serving a life sentence for murder has not gone away, and he is communicating with his fellow gang members through coded letters. Crime author and mafia expert Roberto . Saviano made the claim after analysing a hand-written letter addressed to Zagaria, the former head of the . Camorra's Casalesi clan, which was intercepted by investigators. Victory: Italian police arrested Michele Zagaria last December after 16 years on the run. He was the most senior boss of the Camorra mafia still at large . In an analysis for the Italian daily La Repubblica, Saviano says the letter uses 'cryptic and allusive' language and 'a real construction of coded messages' to give information about how the restructuring of the clan, its activities with other crime groups, and its contact with corrupt politicians. He cites the sentence: 'the friends are going on holiday and they took the home-made jam and they say 'hi',' and says this probably means that clan members are due in court but will keep their mouths shut. They thought it was all over: Italian policemen were jubilant after Zagaria's arrest last December. Now a letter to him suggests he is being kept informed of developments within the notorious Casalesi clan . The line 'We're all well and the children are growing up' could well refer to appointments and promotions that followed the jailing of senior clan members including Zagaria, says Saviano. Zagaria is nicknamed Capastorta, or 'twisted head', in a reference either to his violent reputation or his asymmetrical features. 'At the market we filled the car with fruit' could refer to arms, hand grenades being commonly known as pineapples, or to lucrative dealings in large fruit and vegetable markets, which are often run by mafia clans. Saviona even asserts that a line about 'Uncle Nicola in his gallery' appreciating 'everything that he's heard' could allude to Nicola Cosentino, a former junior economics minister of Silvio Berlusconi, who some MPs want arrested over his alleged links to the Camorra. Control: Al Pacino in the 1972 film The Godfather immortalised the mafia's notoriety . Mr Saviano admits that despite being an authority on the Naples mafia – he has lived under armed guard since the publication of his best-selling book Gomorrah: Italy's Other Mafia – much of his interpretation of the letter is speculation. He said even the recipients might not understand the contents of such letters until subsequent events – such as arrests or killings – provide meaning or context. However what was not in doubt was that Camorra members used a complex system to ensure their words could not be used against them in court, he said. The clan, notorious for its violence, is heavily involved in supplying drugs to the Mafia in Palermo and has alliances with Albanian mobsters and Nigerian crime syndicates.",Expert author says references to home-made jam and Uncle Nicola may have a darker meaning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 31 March 2012 . Billionaire Warren Buffett believed the country's richest should be taxed more to help decrease debt . Billionaire Warren Buffett urged U.S. lawmakers to raise taxes on the country's super-rich to help cut the budget deficit, saying such a move will not hurt investments. The 80-year-old accused Congress of being 'billionaire friendly' and claimed in an opinion article for the New York Times that they spared him and his rich friends when talking about a 'shared sacrifice'. He said: 'Our leaders have asked for ""shared . sacrifice"". But when they did the asking, they spared me. I checked with . my mega-rich friends to learn what pain they were expecting. They, too, . were left untouched. 'My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. 'It's time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.' Buffett, one of the world's richest men and chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said his federal tax bill last year was $6,938,744. 'That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 per cent of my taxable income - and that's actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. 'Their tax burdens ranged from 33 per cent to 41 per cent and averaged 36 per cent,' he said. Lawmakers engaged in a partisan battle over spending and taxes for more than three months before agreeing on August 2 to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt ceiling, avoiding a U.S. default. Mr Buffett said: 'Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country's fiscal problems. 'Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness.' He said higher taxes for the rich will not discourage investment and cited the example of the eighties when rates were much higher. Buffett, one of the world's richest men and chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said his federal tax bill last year was $6,938,744 . 'Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. 'According to a theory I sometimes . hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the . elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends. 'I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone - not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 per cent in 1976-77 - shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. 'People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off.' He also commented that raising taxes would create jobs, contrary to popular belief, saying: 'And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation' Speaking on behalf of the country's wealthy, he also said that the rich would not have a problem paying more taxes, if it meant they were helping the country out of a debt hole. 'I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people,' he said. 'They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. 'Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.' MSNBC's Pat Buchanan challenged Mr Buffett's editorial on 'Morning Joe' telling him to put his money where his mouth is. He said: 'Why doesn’t he set an example and send a check for $5 billion to the federal government? He’s got about $40 billion. 'You know, you had a plan up there, I talked to Howie Carr at Boston where the super-rich could contribute an extra amount. It was something like one-tenth of one percent did it. 'You get all this noise from these big rich folks. Let them send checks and set an example instead of writing op-eds.'",Claims Congress are billionaire friendly and forgot about the wealthy when talking about the 'shared sacrifice'

A convicted fraudster who is believed to have stolen more than £60million in a number of frauds is finally facing justice after four years on the run. Michael Brown - the Liberal Democrat's largest donor - is expected to be in a British jail within ten days. He was deported to Spain from the Dominican Republic, where he had been living a lavish lifestyle with stolen millions. But last night Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg continued to insist the Lib Dems will not repay £2.4million of ill-gotten gains Brown gave his party in 2005. And mystery continues to surround a missing £18million which police are still trying to trace. Extradition: Convicted fraudster Michael Brown and his wife Sharon pictured in Mallorca in 2008 . That decision sparked fury yesterday amid claims that even Brown thinks the Lib Dems failed to scrutinise his firm properly before accepting the cash. Brown will face an extradition hearing this week that should lead to him being put on a plane to the UK to serve a seven-year prison sentence. An international manhunt was launched when he went on the run after stealing up to £60million, including £8million from Martin Edwards, the former chairman of Manchester United. Police are still trying to trace around £18million of that haul. Brown fled the UK for the Caribbean after being convicted of fraud at Southwark Crown Court in 2008. He was arrested in the Dominican Republic in January in the town of Punta Cana over an unrelated fraud charge. Prosecutors in the Dominican Republic said Brown was deported to Spain at the request of British police. The UK does not have a formal extradition agreement with the Dominican Republic, so in an elaborate deal it was agreed that he would be sent first to Spain. If Brown does not appeal against extradition to Britain, it will have to take place within ten days. Lavish: Brown's private gated hideaway . in the Dominican Republic. Up until recently he was renting a . property within the exclusive Arrecife estate, a resort community with its own golf courses and private . beaches . A spokesman for the City of London Police said: ‘We will be taking the appropriate steps to bring him back via a European Arrest Warrant.’ Det Supt Bob Wishart added: ‘Mr Brown is a step closer to returning to the UK to start his prison sentence. ‘We hope that him facing justice will bring some closure to the victims who suffered as a result of his frauds.’ But his victims got cold comfort from the Liberal Democrats, who have repeatedly refused to hand over money to those defrauded by Brown. An Electoral Commission inquiry in 2009 found the Lib Dems accepted the fraudster’s donation in good faith and cleared them of wrongdoing. Mr Clegg denied the party had a moral responsibility to hand over the money. He said: ‘I’m very pleased he’s coming back to serve his sentence. This is a convicted fraudster. ‘I should stress that this is something which happened, as far as the Liberal Democrats are concerned, before I was even an MP, let alone leader of the Liberal Democrats. ‘And what I’ve been told is that the Electoral Commission in 2009 looked at this exhaustively, as far as the receipt of that money by the Liberal Democrats from one of his companies, and they categorically concluded that the money was received in good faith and all the controls, all the checks that should have been made, were reasonably made by the Liberal Democrats at the time. ‘If we’d been shown wanting on those accounts, then of course we should pay the money back.’ Michael Brown made a record donation to the Liberal Democrat party which is now run by Nick Clegg . Labour deputy chairman Tom Watson . yesterday published details of a draft letter written by Mr Brown, which . he says is with the police, and in which the fraudster alleges the Lib . Dems carried out only rudimentary checks on whether his was a legitimate . company. It says: ‘In the case of the donation made by my company, very little due diligence was undertaken. ‘A . check was made in Companies House that the company was duly . incorporated but little or no due diligence was undertaken on whether . the company was trading.’ Mr . Watson said: ‘It’s hard not to conclude that the money should be . repaid. Clearly, Mr Clegg’s party failed to conduct all proper checks.’ Labour MP Steve McCabe called for ‘proceeds of crime legislation to be used to recover money he gave Lib Dems’. Mike Gapes, another MP, added the ‘Lib Dems surely have a moral responsibility to pay back to his victims’. The . usual route from the Dominican Republic to the UK is via Miami in . Florida. But Britain wanted to avoid a stopover there to avoid any . chance of Brown being held by the U.S. authorities, who are also probing . reports of him money laundering. He . is also wanted in Mallorca on fraud charges, opening the prospect that . he will be sent back to Spain after completing his sentence in the UK.","Michael Brown, 46, fled to Caribbean in 2008 after being convicted of fraud at Southwark Crown Court .

Defendant: Levi Miller 'would have cut off more beards had he known he was going to be caught' An Amish man accused of cutting the beards and hair of fellow Amish men in a violent hate crime said he would have sliced off more if he knew he was going to be caught, a detective has claimed. Levi Miller, one of the 16 defendants accused of the beard-cutting attacks in northeast Ohio last year, allegedly admitted to being sorry as he had been involved and because he was caught. Holmes County Detective Joe Mullet recounted Miller's words as he testified against the men in Cleveland federal court on Wednesday. The defendants, members of a breakaway Amish group from Steubenville, are accused of staging five attacks between September and November last year as 'punishment' for the victims. In court, the county sheriff, Timothy Zimmerly, recalled the horror among residents after finding their community leader had his beard and hair cut by the men in a nighttime home invasion. 'There was a lot of screaming and yelling go on,' he told the court. Zimmerly said last October he went to . the home of an Amish bishop whose beard was cut short and saw the man's hair was unevenly chopped to the scalp, leaving it bloody. 'There . was a lot of hair laying on the floor,' he testified as Amish watched . from the public gallery. 'They were excited, very upset.' The government calls the attacks . religion-based hate crimes meant to humiliate Amish who cite Scripture . in keeping beards after they are married and, for women, growing their . hair long. Community: Amish leave the Cleveland, Ohio federal courthouse where the case began last week . Support: Women leave the court, where 16 members of the community stand trial for cutting hair . But the defense has tried to portray the . attacks as internal church disciplinary matters, not a religion-based . hate crime as prosecutors argue. 'Ringleader': Sam Mullet, Sr. is accused of staging the attacks in a response to criticism of his leadership . Defense attorneys questioned Zimmerly about how accused ringleader, Sam Mullet Sr., escorted his son and nephew when they surrendered, apparently to show he had cooperated with police. The trial started last week and could last several weeks. The charges include conspiracy, assault and evidence tampering in Steubenville, eastern Ohio farm country. Those accused of planning and taking part in the attacks targeted the hair and beards of Amish bishops as it has spiritual significance for the faith, prosecutors said. Such hair-cutting attacks are offensive . to the Amish because they believe women let their . hair grow long and men to grow beards after marriage to show devotion to God. Prosecutors said there were five separate attacks last year, orchestrated by Mullet. All the defendants could face lengthy prison terms if convicted on charges. Mullet has denied ordering the hair-cutting but said he didn’t stop anyone from carrying it out. Last year he said that the hair-cutting was a response to criticism of his leadership from other Amish bishops. 'They changed the rulings of our . church here, and they're trying to force their way down our throat, make . us do like they want us to do, and we're not going to do that,' Mullet . said. On trial: Miller (second right) sits next to, from left, Johnny Mullet, Lester Mullet, Daniel Mullet and his son Eli Miller in court in Millersburg, Ohio last year. They are all charged with teh hate crimes . Attorneys for the defendants have not denied the hair cuttings took place and said members of the group took action as they were concerned that some Amish were straying from their beliefs. They also contended that the Amish are bound by different rules guided by their religion and that the government should not get involved in what amounted to a family or church dispute.","Levi Miller 'admitted he had been involved and was sorry he was caught'

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 12:32 EST, 5 October 2011 . A third of U.S. veterans of the post-9/11 military believes the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were not worth fighting for, it has emerged. Many of them also think that after 10 years of fighting America should focus more on its own problems instead of foreign affairs, according to an opinion survey. The findings highlight a dilemma for the Obama administration and Congress as they struggle to tackle the Government's huge budget deficits and reconsider defence priorities while trying to maintain public support for those still in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'Not worth it': Many veterans believe that after 10 years of fighting America should focus more on its own problems, according to the survey . Human cost of war: Almost 4,500 U.S. troops have died in Iraq and about 1,700 in Afghanistan with the combined costs of the conflicts topping $1trillion . Almost 4,500 U.S. troops have died in Iraq and about 1,700 in Afghanistan with the combined costs of the wars since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 topping $1trillion. The Pew Research Center's poll reveals the post-9/11 veterans are proud of their work but are scarred by warfare and convinced the American public has little understanding of the problems wartime service has created for the military and their families. The survey also showed that post-9/11 veterans are more likely than Americans as a whole to call themselves Republicans and to disapprove of President Barack Obama's performance as commander in chief. They also are more likely than earlier generations of veterans to have no religious affiliation. The study was described as the 'first of its kind' by the Pew Research Center, a politically-impartial organisation which studies attitudes and trends. The survey was based on two polls conducted between late July and mid-September. One survey questioned 1,853 veterans - including 712 who had served in the military after 9/11 but are no longer on active duty. Of these 712 post-9/11 veterans, 336 served in Iraq or Afghanistan. The second poll surveyed 2,003 adults who had not served in the military. Nearly half of post-9/11 veterans said deployments strained their relationship with their spouses, and a similar share reported problems with their children. However, 60 per cent said they and their families benefited financially from having served abroad in a combat zone. The war veterans used words such as 'rewarding,' 'nightmare,' 'eye opening,' 'lousy,' when asked to descried their experiences. There are about 98,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, where the conflict began with a U.S.-led invasion on Oct. 7, 2001. Obama campaigned for the presidency in 2008 on getting out of Iraq and ramping up the military campaign in Afghanistan. He is on track to remove all U.S. troops out of Iraq by the end of this year, and in July he announced that he would pull 10,000 troops out of Afghanistan this year and 23,000 more by next September. The Pew survey found that veterans are ambivalent about the net value of the wars, although they generally were more positive about Afghanistan, which has been a more protracted but less deadly conflict for U.S. forces. One-third of post-9/11 veterans said neither war was worth the sacrifices; that was the view of 45 percent in the separate poll of members of the general public. Fifty percent of veterans said Afghanistan was worth it, whereas the poll of civilians put it at 41 per cent. Combat zone: The survey reveals post-9/11 veterans are proud of their work but are scarred by warfare . Among veterans, 44 percent said Iraq was worth it. That compares with 36 percent in the poll of civilians. Of the surveyed former service members who were seriously wounded or knew someone who was killed or seriously wounded, 48 per cent said the war in Iraq was worth fighting, compared with 36 percent of those veterans who had no personal exposure to casualties. Exposure to casualties had an even larger impact on attitudes toward the war in Afghanistan. Fifty-five per cent of those exposed to casualties said Afghanistan has been worth the cost to the U.S., whereas 40 per cent of those who were not exposed to casualties held that same view. Pew said its survey results found 'isolationist inclinations' among post-9/11 war veterans. About 6-in-10 said the United States should pay less attention to problems overseas and instead concentrate on problems at home. In a Pew survey conducted earlier this year, a similar share of the general public agreed. The survey also reflected what many view as a troublesome cultural gap between the military and the general public. Although numerous polls have shown that Americans hold the military in high regard, the respondents in the Pew research acknowledged a lack of understanding of what military life entails. Only 27 percent of adult civilians said the public understands the problems facing those in uniform, and the share of veterans who said so is even lower - 21 percent.","Veterans believe America should focus on its on problems, poll reveals ."

Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, Rader said, 'but the trade-off is more crashes and more highway deaths.' A 2009 report in the American Journal of Public Health studied traffic fatalities in the U.S. from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads. The study also said that rural highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where speed limits were raised, but did not cite specific numbers in those instances. Most highways in the U.S. top out at 75 mph, and there are no longer any roads in the U.S. with no speed limit like Germany's autobahn. Some highways in rural West Texas and Utah have 80 mph speed limits. The Texas Legislature last year approved 85 mph limits for some new stretches of road. The strip of toll road running from Austin to Seguin, about 35 miles northeast of San Antonio, will be the first to allow that speed when it opens in November. The Texas Transportation Commission, which is appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, approved the 85 mph speed limit at a public meeting on August 30. A transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment on their decision. Record speeds: Map shows top speed limits across the U.S . Agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road's topography, the speeds that most drivers were reaching, and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit. 'Safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one,' agency spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said. Alan Guckian, who lives in Austin and regularly drives to Seguin to visit family, said he'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast. 'I would love it,' Guckian said. 'Sometimes it's fun to just open it up.' Steve Marcy sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from Round Rock, north of Austin, to his job in San Antonio. The section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit. Marcy said he'd be comfortable driving 85, but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition. 'A tire blowout (at 85 mph) could be a big hazard,' Marcy said. Chris Lippincott, spokesman for SH 130 Concession Co. that is building the road, said the company is committed to operating a safe highway. 'On any road, drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic, travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles,' Lippincott said. Toll prices have not yet been set for the new section. Marcy predicted the higher speed limit will attract new drivers, but said most won't think it's worth the cost of the tolls. 'For most people I talk to, it's a cost issue,' Marcy said.","Will be top speed limit in the United States .

The online blog of murdered Marine wife Brittany Killgore reveals her fears about marriage and divorce, providing an insight into what was troubling the 22-year-old five years ago. In the blog entitled 13smyfavoritenumber, Killgore, whose nude body was discovered on Tuesday, wrote about her insecurities and how she suffered from depression, according to NBC San Diego. ‘im so insecure sometimes its not even funny (sic),’ she wrote aged 17, adding that she had recently stopped taking anti-depressants.

Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring . She also told how she was worried . about getting married because of the high divorce rates. Tragically, . Killgore had filed for divorce from her Marine husband Cory Killgore the . week before she went missing. When responding to a question about . whether she wanted to get married, Killgore wrote in 2007: ‘i want to . be, but … i want to love that person. the divorce rate is so high its . sad.’ In other postings, Killgore revealed . she did not get on with her family and was looking forward to moving out . and going to college. ‘im planning to move out its very . difficult. i dont get along with my family all that well i think it will . be better when i move out. my sister and i have gotten closer though, . its actully realy weird,’ she said . The blog comes to light as the woman accused of killing the young wife pleaded not guilty to murder charges on Thursday. Prosecutors offered no details of the . motive Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, had to allegedly harm Killgore, whose . body was discovered in brush near a lake in San Diego, California. Suicide attempt: Jessica Lynn Lopez was found with numerous self-inflicted stab wounds on her body at this Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport . Estranged: Brittany Killgore, right, filed for divorce from husband Cory, left, last week . However, Lopez's neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex ring, playing sex slaves. A . second Marine, Louis Ray Perez, who has been named a person of . interest, has not been charged with the murder. He is currently in jail, . facing charges he stole an assault rifle. Lopez was discovered with the note in a San Diego hotel room, . prosecutor Patrick Espinoza said. No further details were released about . the note. Authorities said earlier this week . that paramedics hospitalized Lopez after finding her with self-inflicted . cuts in the room but didn't disclose the suicide note. Within hours of . finding Lopez, searchers discovered the body of Killgore. Bail for Lopez was set at $3 million at her arraignment in Vista Superior Court, north of San Diego. Lopez's . attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or . Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez . turned 25. 'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said. Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton . 'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.' Mr . Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her . family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who . live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their . daughter. 'We pray for the . family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during . their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.' Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected. A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring, saying: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.' Perez, 45, pleaded not guilty . on Wednesday to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton. Investigators have given few . details about that case, and it was not known if they suspect the weapon . was tied to Killgore's death. Perez was being held on $500,000 . bond. His attorney Jeffrey Reichert said his client has no criminal . history, is married and has lived in San Diego County for 10 years. Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after . filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to . Afghanistan. Fears: Cory, right, is returning from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left . Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner in Riverside . County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in . Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards. Killgore lived a short walk from an . entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is . full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents . and often don't get to know each other well. Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal . Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was . missing. Sheriff's authorities say he is not a suspect. The couple from Missouri were married . in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed . 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the . paperwork. Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, an area populated with bars and restaurants. Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, . confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not . commenting on anything at this time. Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note . of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including . the location of a body. Serious: The Fallbrook scene where Louis Ray Perez is being questioned in connection with the disappearance . ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, . where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an . apparent suicide attempt. That woman, 27-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalised at UCSD Medical Center. She was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, and charged with murder in Killgore's death.

The devastated mother of two young boys who were killed by their father who then committed suicide today said her children had 'meant everything to her'. Heart-broken Victoria Jones, from Andover, in Hampshire, paid a moving tribute to her sons Jack Anderson, 11, and three-year-old brother Bryn after they were discovered dead at their father's home in Tidworth, Wiltshire, on Saturday. Their father, Graham Anderson, . 36, was found dead in another room at the property. Murdered: 11-year-old Jack Anderson and his three-year-old brother Bryn was killed by their violent father . Ms Jones said Jack as an . intelligent and sporty little boy with a love for football, maths and . science who was preparing to start secondary school. She added: 'He was loved by everyone who met him as he was such a sociable child. 'He was caring and loving towards Bryn and was the best big brother in the world.' Ms Jones, said younger son Bryn was an animal lover who idolised his big brother. She said: 'Bryn was a cheeky chappie who doted on and looked up to his elder brother. 'He enjoyed playing in his sandpit and on his trike. He loved animals, especially cats. 'Jack was due to start secondary school this week while Bryn was due to start at playgroup. 'Both Jack and Bryn will be sorely missed by their family and friends. The boys meant everything to me.' Tragic: Jack and Bryn were found dead in Wiltshire alongside their father .

Some hold on to it to pass on to a daughter or niece. Others even wear it to renew their vows. Pauline Prescott’s wedding dress, on the other hand, ended up on the tip. The wife of the former Deputy Prime Minister revealed that she was forced to dump the treasured gown after her husband grew tired of lugging it around during house moves. Scroll down to watch the hilarious highlights! Confessions: Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott and his wife Pauline gave a glimpse into their marital life in an appearance on All Star Mr And Mrs . And although it is almost five decades since the dress became landfill, it seems a touch of resentment remains, with Lady Prescott, 73, saying: ‘John has never kept his wedding suit. I wish he had so I could throw it on the tip.’ The couple made the confession – and a few others – to television presenter Phillip Schofield when they appeared on his show All Star Mr And Mrs last night. Lord Prescott said he regretted disposing of the dress and had not realised its value at the time. The 74-year-old explained: ‘When we got married she bought a wedding dress but she never told me how much it cost. At the time she told me she would turn it into a cocktail dress but she never did. ‘We also had this big box and we used to carry it from house to house. One day I said let’s get rid of it. She was pregnant at the time. So we went down to the corporation tip and we dumped it. ‘She never told me how much the wedding dress was but she has been going to those boutiques for years’. 'Mystery and surprise': Lord Prescott, left, and his wife, right, each donned headphones during parts of the show so they couldn't hear what the other was saying . The couple also admitted that another source of conflict between them is the kitchen. Lord Prescott said: ‘Pauline wishes I had two offices so I would not use her kitchen as an office. She always complains about that. ‘There was a time when Tony Blair rang up and she was banging the pots and pans in the kitchen and I said “Listen love, can you shut up, I am talking to Tony” and she said “This is my kitchen, not your office. And who is Tony?” ‘Tony Blair then came on the phone and said: “I heard that.” ‘I was trying to get Tony and  Gordon to agree and there she  was banging the plates. It was a crucial moment. She deliberately goes around banging plates so you can’t hear the phone.’ However, while the couple were quick to confess their more amusing marital conflicts in front of a studio audience on the ITV show, there was one bump in the road that did not get a mention. In 2006, it emerged that Lord Prescott had carried out an affair with his glamorous secretary Tracey Temple, a divorcee 24 years his junior. The two-year fling began at an office Christmas party in 2002 after months of flirtation. The pair continued secret trysts at the politician’s grace-and-favour flat in Whitehall and at Dorneywood, his 215-acre country retreat in Buckinghamshire, until 2004. Last year, Lord Prescott said: ‘It was stupid. I’ve got no excuse really. People talk about mid-life crisis but I think it was part of an opportunity that developed.’ Though they have stayed together, in an interview last year Lady Prescott admitted she would never forgive her husband. The couple married in Chester in 1961 when Lord Prescott, 23, was a ship steward, and 22-year-old Lady Prescott worked as a hairdresser. On last night’s programme, the Labour stalwart paid tribute to his wife, saying: ‘I could not have been successful without her. She always pinches the TV remote off me though. It’s 50 years and there is still mystery and surprise so long may that continue.’ In the show, one half of the couple is asked questions about their partner, while the other is taken to a separate booth, blindfolded and fitted with headphones to stop them hearing the answers. When they return, they are asked the same questions – and have to give the same answer to score points and win money for charity.","The former Deputy Prime Minister admitted bringing his wife's wedding gown to the tip during an appearance on All Star Mr And Mrs .

A wave of violence has been sweeping through Chicago in recent months, leaving dozens of victims in its wake, but that did not stop the local police department from sending 50 officers to help out at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. On Monday morning, Chicago cops in their unmistakable checkerboard-brimmed hats were seen positioned outside the Charlotte Convention Center. A Charlotte police department spokesperson confirmed that ‘roughly 50 officers from Chicago’ were on duty at the high-profile political event being held this week. Out-of-town mission: Fifty of Chicago's finest, pictured here during the recent NATO summit, were sent to the Democratic convention to help with security . Outside help: Chicago officers are helping their Charlotte counterparts (pictured) with protesters outside the convention venue . ‘These are officers on their days off and were specially trained as mobile field force officers for the recent NATO summit in Chicago,’ Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Melissa Stratton told ABC News. The move has drawn sharp criticism from community leaders in the Windy City, who questioned the logic behind sending officers out of town at a time when urban crime appears to be out of control. ‘It's a state of emergency here in Chicago,’ Reverend Ira Acree told the Wall Street Journal last week. At least 82 people have been wounded or killed on the streets of Chicago in the last ten days, with approximately ten of them gunned down on August 31 alone, according to a police report. Drive-bys: Among the ten shot between late Thursday night and early Friday morning, several of them were the result of two drive by shootings . Into the morning: Later Friday morning, in broad daylight a 15-year-old girl was shot in the abdomen while caught in crossfire while walking home from school . The crime spree has left several teenagers and people in their 20s dead and wounded, including a 15-year-old girl who was struck in the abdomen in broad daylight while walking home from school with a friend. Change of plans: Mayor Emanuel has decided to cut his trip to the Democratic National Convention short due to the crime wave in his city . The relentless gun violence has prompted Mayor Rahm Emanuel to request federal assistance. In response, a total of 50 U.S. marshals and agents from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents were dispatched to Chicago to assist the local police department. In the next four months, the new arrivals will saturate the Grand Crossing and Ogden police districts on the South and West sides, which have been labelled conflict zones, the Chicago Tribune reported. ‘We've obviously had a very difficult August, so we have our work cut out for us,’ Mayor Emanuel said on Friday. According to figures provided by the Chicago police, the city’s homicide rate is about 31 per cent higher than last year, leading many people, among them police union officials, to call into question the decision to send 50 officers to another state at this critical time. The city's police force is comprised of 12,244 sworn officers. However, police say the officers were sent to Charlotte to reciprocate for the law enforcement forces sent by that city to assist during the recent NATO summit held in Chicago. The Chicago Police Department spokesperson said the officers serving in Charlotte will be paid through a special federal grant of $50million for convention security. ‘No funds from the City of Chicago are involved,’ Stratton said. Tit-for-tat: Chicago officials said they sent the officers to the convention to reciprocate for the police sent by Charlotte to the Windy City during the NATO summit . Meanwhile, on Monday, Mayor Emanuel, a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff, has announced that he will be cutting his trip to the convention short in light of the violence back home, according to Politico. Rather than stay in Charlotte through Friday morning as planned, the mayor will be leaving late Wednesday after delivering a speech at the convention the night before. The president is scheduled to address the delegates on Thursday.","Officers were sent to reciprocate for Charlotte police that helped with NATO summit in Chicago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:47 EST, 23 August 2011 . The hotel maid who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of rape rolled around on the floor hysterically crying when confronted about a web of lies she is said to have told to have him arrested. As the Manhattan district attorney's . office asked a judge to drop the sexual assault case against the . former International Monetary Fund chief, it emerged accuser Nafissatou Diallo finally admitted to her deception, simply telling prosecutors: 'I wasn't under oath'. In a stunning turnaround, Strauss-Kahn is now almost certain to be released today in court, leaving him free to return to France and even run for the country's presidency. Damaged case: The Manhattan District Attorney's Office caught Nafissatou Diallo, left, in several lies about shady deposits in her bank account, and personal dealings after the alleged sex attack . Web of lies: Prosecutors filed a motion that included never-before-seen evidence about Nafissatou Diallo and her attempts to deceive investigators . The details about Miss Diallo's . hysterical response to being confronted about her alleged lies come as . New York prosecutors will today say they do . not have sufficient evidence to prove a hotel maid's claim that Mr . Strauss-Kahn, 62, tried to rape her. They are expected to state that Nafissatou Diallo has a history of lying that makes it impossible to ask a jury to believe her. The $3,000 night hotel room Strauss-Kahn was staying in when he allegedly attacked Miss Diallo contained the semen of between four and seven other men, the report revealed. Four stains were found on the carpet of the room at the Sofitel, three of which contained remnants of the semen of three different men. The fourth stain on its own, bizarrely, contained DNA from three different men. Investigators also found another stain on the wallpaper. According to the recommendation for dismissal, the stains provided 'no evidence that any other person was present during the charged incident'. Therefore, 'the circumstances under which the unidentified DNA was deposited are unrelated,' it found. The development follows a meeting with Diallo and prosecutors about a 'bombshell' report with details of her alleged deception. 'In virtually every substantive interview with prosecutors, despite . entreaties to simply be truthful, she has not been truthful, on matters . great and small, many pertaining to her background and some relating to . the circumstances of the incident itself,' the document states. Judges immediately approve these kinds of requests, experts said. 'After an extensive investigation, it . is clear that proof of two critical elements - force and lack of consent . - would rest solely on the testimony of the complaining witness at . trial. Indeed, the case rises and falls on her testimony.' the report . continued. 'Because we cannot credit the complainant's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so.' Among evidence provided to prove Miss . Diallo's lies is a history of supposedly fraudulent statements she is . said to have made under oath in the past, as well as conflicting . accounts told to investigators, the media and in court. 'We have no confidence that the . complainant would tell the truth on this issue if she were called as a . witness at trial,' the report states. When she told prosecutors she was . gang raped by soldiers in Guinea, her country of birth, she 'laid her . head face down on her arms on a table in front of her,' as she said her . two-year-old daughter was pulled from her arms and thrown to the floor. The hotel maid later admitted she had not been gang raped and that she had made up the story to help gain asylum to the U.S. When confronted about another lie, she is said to have 'dropped to the floor, and physically rolled around while weeping.' Maid in Manhattan: Nafissatou Diallo walks with her attorney Kenneth Thompson to a press conference following a short meeting with the Manhattan DA . The document goes on to allege that . she failed to disclose $60,000 in deposits made to her account 'by . individuals in four different states'. When she was asked about the money, . she said it was from her fiancé Amara Tarawally - who has been convicted . of drug offences in Arizona after he tried to buy $36,500 of marijuana . from undercover policemen. While Miss Diallo insisted she had no intention to try cash in on her case against Strauss-Kahn, . the papers allege that 'very close in time to these statements, the . complainant had a recorded conversation with her incarcerated fiancé, in . which the potential for financial recovery in relation to the May 14, . 2011 incident was mentioned.' The report continues: 'Although there . is nothing wrong with seeking recovery from a defendant in a civil . suit, the complainant's disavowal of any financial interest is relevant . to her credibility.' The sudden turnaround has led to speculation that Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist politician, could resume his campaign to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as President of France next year. Socialist Party chief Martine Aubry called it 'an immense relief' that prosecutors asked a judge to put an end to the case based on concerns about the accuser's credibility. Mrs Aubry said on France-Info radio today: 'We were all waiting for this ... for him to finally be able to get out of this nightmare.' The man who replaced Strauss-Khan as favourite for the Socialist Party presidential nomination yesterday said the former IMF chief's political comeback could be 'envisaged'. Francois Hollande told France Inter Radio: 'A man with the abilities of Dominique Strauss-Kahn can be useful to his country in the months and years to come.' Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and wife Anne Sinclair were pictured taking a stroll around Tribeca over the weekend . Although Strauss-Kahn has missed the . July deadline for potential Socialist candidates to declare, several . party heavyweights have previously suggested it pushed back. Outside the courthouse after the brief meeting, Miss Diallo's lawyer said the DA was making a mistake. 'Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus . Vance has denied the right of a woman to get justice in a rape case. He . has not only turned his back on this innocent victim, but he has also . turned his back on the forensic, medical and other physical evidence in . this case.' Mr Strauss-Kahn's next court date is today at 11:30am. Among . questions raised by prosecutors are about evidence of shady deposits in . her bank account, and personal dealings after the alleged attack. The . district attorney's office also alleges that Miss Diallo, 32, lied . about having consensual sex the night before the alleged assault that . would explain redness her lawyers used as proof of Strauss-Kahn's guilt. But the maid was not going down without a fight. Miss Diallo's lawyer Kenneth Thompson petitioned the court Monday to drop the district attorney from the case. Her . attorneys allege that the Manhattan District Attorney's office has . bungled the Strauss-Kahn case, and even kicked Miss Diallo out of the . office when one of their meetings grew particularly heated. Accused: Former International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn is being sued for unspecified damages . Thompson has charged that Assistant DA Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told them: 'No one with half a brain would ever put her on the stand.' Mr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as IMF . chief after his arrest, could still face a civil claim filed by Miss . Diallo’s lawyers, alleging he carried out a 'senseless attack' on her. She has faced criticism for a series of magazine and television interviews before the case went to trial. The maid has also been accused of lying about her past in Guinea and being involved with criminal elements. Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, William . Taylor and Benjamin Brafman, issued a statement saying that he and his . family were grateful for the decision. They . said: 'We have maintained from the beginning of this case that our . client is innocent. We also maintained that there were many reasons to . believe that Mr. Strauss-Kahn's accuser was not credible.' There . has been widespread speculation that prosecutors would drop the case . since late June when they revealed that Diallo had lied repeatedly in . her statements and in her application for U.S. asylum, casting a shadow . over her credibility. Legal observers say the only way the case could be revived is if prosecutors turn up new evidence. That appears highly unlikely. Commentators say the case-pitting a West African immigrant against a rich, white man who was in the running to become the next president of France could define the career of first-time prosecutor, Cyrus Vance Jr. It . will also be remembered as one where Vance stood in front of the . world's media to vouch for the integrity of the arrest before completing . the investigation and vetting the maid's credibility. Observers . say it may not have been wise to defend the case on the courthouse . steps or to rush it into the grand jury before an investigation. But most applauded Vance for revealing that the alleged victim, who has spoken publicly about the case, lied on her asylum application about being gang-raped and has ties to a jailed drug dealer. 'He took all the right steps, even if he may not be happy where they took him,' prominent defence lawyer Paul Shechtman said. Others, like radical defence lawyer and frequent Vance critic, Ron Kuby, were less supportive. 'It's an unmitigated disaster,' he said. Diallo filed a civil claim against Strauss-Kahn last week in New York. Her lawyers had been exploring a deal to scuttle the criminal case in exchange for a monetary settlement in the civil lawsuit, according to The Wall Street Journal. Mr Strauss-Kahn had been seen as a leading contender in next year's French presidential election when Diallo accused him of sexual assault on May 14 at the Sofitel Hotel in New York, forcing him to resign as head of International Monetary Fund a few days later.","Accuser Diallo 'dropped to the floor and rolled around while weeping'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:26 EST, 5 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:48 EST, 5 September 2012 . Fall from grace: A federal probe found former Harvard psychology professor Marc Hauser to be responsible for six cases of research misconduct . Federal investigators have found that a Harvard University psychology professor who resigned after being accused of scientific transgression fabricated data and manipulated results in experiments. The findings detailing Marc Hauser's transgressions were contained in a report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity (ORI) released Wednesday online. Hauser, 52, left Harvard last summer, ten months after a faculty investigation found him ‘solely responsible’ for eight instances of scientific misconduct at the prestigious Ivy League school, the Boston Globe reported. The federal document found six cases in which Hauser engaged in research misconduct in work supported by four National Institutes of Health grants. One paper was retracted and two were corrected. Other problems were found in unpublished work. Hauser released a statement Wednesday, saying that although he has fundamental differences with the findings, he acknowledges that he made mistakes. ‘I let important details get away from my control, and as head of the lab, I take responsibility for all errors made within the lab, whether or not I was directly involved,’ he stated. ‘I am saddened that this investigation has caused some to question all of my work, rather than the few papers and unpublished studies in question. ‘I remain proud of the many important papers generated by myself, my collaborators and my students over the years. I am also deeply gratified to see my students carve out significant areas of research at major universities around the world,’ Hauser said. Internal probe: A three-year investigation at Harvard found in 2010 that Hauser had committed eight instances of scientific misconduct . In one instance, investigators determined that Hauser fabricated half the data in a bar graph in a research paper on cotton-top tamarind monkeys’ ability to learn syllables that was published in 2002 in the journal Cognition. According to the findings of the probe, the 52-year-old professor ‘falsified the coding’ of some monkeys’ responses to sound stimuli in two unpublished papers to ensure that a particular finding does not appear random, and ‘falsely reported the results and methodology’ for one of seven experiments in a paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2007. A paper examining monkeys’ abilities to learn grammatical patterns included false descriptions of how the monkeys’ behavior was coded, ‘leading to a false proportion or number of animals showing a favorable response,’ the report stated. The document, which will be published in the Federal Register Thursday, comes on the heels of a three-year internal investigation at Harvard that found in 2010 that the popular professor had committed eight instances of scientific misconduct. According to the report, Hauser ‘neither admits nor denies committing research misconduct but accepts ORI has found evidence of research misconduct.’ As part of a voluntary settlement, the former professor has accepted several professional restrictions for the next three years. New job: Hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the Alternative Education Program at Cape Cod Collaborative . Hauser has agreed to have any research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service supervised, to exclude himself from serving as an adviser to the PHS, and to have his employer guarantee the accuracy of his data and methodology before applying for federal funding. According to his LinkedIn profile, Hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the Alternative Education Program at Cape Cod Collaborative. Houser, a published author of popular books favored by the media, gained wide recognition for his research into the evolutionary roots of human abilities, including language, and whether morality was inborn or learned. Less than a week ago, Hauser's former Ivy League employer made national headlines after it has been revealed that 125 students at the prestigious institution are being investigated for allegedly cheating on a take-home exam.","Marc Hauser, 52, researched evolutionary roots of human abilities .

The youngest person in Britain to survive a liver transplant has defied the odds to celebrate her first birthday yesterday. Lottie Bryon-Edmond was given just hours to live after being born with a rare condition which gave her toxic levels of iron in her liver. She went straight to the top of Britain’s transplant list and clung to life for five weeks until a suitable donor was eventually found. Lottie's father Chris Byron-Edmond said: 'She is extremely feisty and that¿s what has saved her' The odds of finding a suitable donor for Lottie were incredibly slim - with just five a year usually coming forward from children who have passed away. Amazingly, Lottie’s new liver came from a living donor, whose parents are believed to have come forward after reading about the baby’s desperate plight. Lottie underwent the lifesaving eight-hour operation at Birmingham Children’s Hospital aged just five weeks. Doctors said she could have died at any point during surgery. The delicate procedure itself offered only a 50 per cent survival rate but Lottie managed to pull through, becoming the youngest person in Britain to live after a transplant. Her family’s ordeal was worsened when violent riots swept through the country, leaving the hospital in lockdown. Thugs . threatened to fire bomb Birmingham Children's Hospital - which cares for some of Britain's . sickest children and while brave staff formed a human shield around its . doors, police ordered a total lock-down. It prevented Lottie’s parents from being with her overnight. Recovering: Lottie pictured at four months with parents Julie and Chris after the successful transplant . Happy days: Chris and Julie Bryon-Edmond with Lottie . Now proud father Chris Byron-Edmond, 48, from Torquay, Devon, said he was delighted his daughter had reached the milestone they feared she would never see. He said: 'We were told our child was going to die but Lottie defied all the odds. She is extremely feisty and that’s what has saved her. 'Lottie has reached a massive milestone. She is doing fantastically. She’s very vocal, if she wants something you jolly well know about.' Lottie had the rare condition neonatal hemochromatosis which caused toxic levels of iron to accumulate in her liver as she was developing in the womb. Doctors warned she could die at any time when she was born seven weeks prematurely at Torbay Hospital in Devon on July 6 last year. She was rushed to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, before being taken to Bristol and then Birmingham Children’s Hospital. Lottie went on the transplant list and her parents faced an anxious 15 day wait until a donor came forward last August. Lottie shortly after birth when her parents were told she would need a liver transplant. She had the procedure at Birmingham Children¿s Hospital aged just five weeks . Surgeons in Birmingham then performed the operation using an extremely rare donor from a live organ. Mr Byron-Edmond said: 'We were told our child was going to die. We were told she wouldn’t make it on the journey to Bristol hospital, but she made it and she was smiling when we got there. 'We were told she wasn’t going to make it once we got to Bristol, and then once at Birmingham we were told she only had two weeks to live. 'But 15 days later, an anonymous donor came forward.' Financial advisor Chris and wife Julie, a sales manager, were prevented from being at their daughter’s bedside because of threats from rioters. Mr Byron-Edmond added: 'It was very surreal - there we were with a little baby dying and then there was helicopters and spot lights and smoke burning. It was a very frightening time.' Chris and Julie, who have nicknamed their daughter ‘Chip’, set up campaign Operation Chip-BE, www.chipbe.com, to encourage more people to become organ donors. Lottie in hospital shortly after birth. Her parents are trying to raise awareness of National Transplant Week . They will celebrate their daughter’s first birthday on Saturday at a grand party with hundreds of friends, family, their local MP and nurses from Birmingham, Bristol and Torquay. Family friend and Devon musician Nick Tilley has written a song describing the tot’s brave fight for life, called ‘Lottie’s Song - A Gift for Life’. Both the party and song, which is available on iTunes, are to raise awareness of National Transplant Week, which begins on Monday. Delighted Julie said she was left 'crying all weekend' after first hearing the single about her special girl. She added: 'Everybody loves her and she really is such a sweet little girl - she never stops smiling. 'To get through what she has been through is just amazing. She is really wonderful.' ‘Lottie’s Song - A Gift for Life’ will be available to download on iTunes, Amazon and all major download sites today.","Lottie clung to life for five weeks until miraculously a donor was found .

Britain was yesterday ranked the eighth best country in the world in which to do business – but continues to be held back by high taxes, red tape and debt. The World Economic Forum – which organises the annual Davos gathering of global leaders – said the UK was up from 10th last year and was now ‘firmly back’ at the top table. It was the highest ranking of the century and follows decades of decline under Labour, as rising taxes, stifling bureaucracy and ballooning debts damaged business and pushed Britain down to as low as 15th in the competitiveness league table. On the up: Britain was yesterday ranked the eighth best country in the world in which to do business - but continues to be held back by high taxes, red tape and debt . ‘The United Kingdom continues to make up lost ground in the rankings this year, rising two more places and now settling firmly back in the top 10,’ said the WEF in its Global Competitiveness Report. The Treasury welcomed the report as proof that government reforms, including cutting corporation tax and relaxing planning laws, were having an impact. But the WEF warned that Britain’s economic situation remained grim and said the world faced ‘a long period of economic uncertainty’ as the debt crisis in the eurozone raged. It said the ‘macroeconomic environment’ – the general state of the economy – was weak, with the UK falling from 85th place last year to 110th out of 144. London's Canary Wharf: The World Economic Forum - which organises the annual Davos gathering of global leaders - said the UK was up from 10th last year and was now 'firmly back' at the top table . And the report raised particular concerns over government finances, with Britain’s budget ranked 137th in the world – meaning only seven countries were worse off. The UK fared worse than Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast and Spain but better than Greece, the United States and Ireland. The WEF, which scores each country according to 12 ‘pillars of competitiveness’, said ‘the most problematic factors for doing business’ in Britain included ‘access to finance’ – a crisis highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Make The Banks Lend campaign. Other problems were tax rates and regulations, government bureaucracy, an inadequately educated workforce, poor infrastructure, burdensome employment laws and a weak work ethic among staff. The report will pile pressure on the government – and the apparently business-friendly junior ministers appointed in this week’s reshuffle – to improve Britain’s competitiveness and drive growth. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government’s reforms are supporting the UK becoming more competitive, such as creating a more flexible and educated workforce, simplifying our tax system, and reducing the main rate of corporation tax – as well as scrapping burdensome regulation and simplifying planning rules.’ Switzerland came top of the WEF world rankings, with Singapore in second place and Finland in third.","The World Economic Forum said the UK was up from 10th last year .

The father of a schoolgirl killed in a bomb blast that hit a school broke down in tears during a church service in her honour. Devestated Massimo Bassi couldn't control his grief during the funeral mass for 16-year-old Melissa. She was killed and ten others injured when two powerful explosions went off outside a school in the southern Italian town of Brindisi. Devastated: Melissa Bassi's father Massimo Bassi breaks down during during a mass at a church in Brindisi today after the bomb blast that claimed his daughters life yesterday . Tragic:  Police are no longer linking the mafia to a school explosion which killed Massimo Bassi's 16-year-old daughter Melissa on Saturday . Release: CCTV image issued on Sunday night by Italian police of a man wanted in connection with the bomb attack outside a school in Brindisi in which 16-year-old Melissa Bassi was killed . Two powerful explosions scattered deadly shrapnel across a wide area just as students were arriving for lessons as the devices, connected to gas canisters and hidden in rucksacks went off. Melissa Bassi, 16, suffered horrific injuries in the explosion and was rushed to hospital but died a short while later from her injuries. There were fears over another of those hurt, a girl, whose condition was described as 'life threatening.' Tragic: Melissa Bassi, 16, suffered horrific injuries in the explosion and was rushed to hospital but died a short while later from her injuries . Paramedics and police were immediately at the scene and TV footage showed scenes of chaos as shocked students gathered outside the building. Investigators initially linked organised crime to the blast, close to the Morvillo Falcone school in Brindisi. The town is home to the local mafia known as the United Sacred Crown who have close links with the Russian and Albanian crime and are linked to drug and gun running. The school is named after Francesca Morvillo Falcone, who was the wife of anti mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, who were both killed in a bomb blast in 1992 which was carried out by the Sicilian Mafia. But today a senior official said the attack was probably carried out by a lone individual and played down earlier suspicions of mafia involvement. A CCTV image of a man wanted in connection with the attack was issued by police on Sunday evening. Rescue: A woman receives first aid after the explosion outside Francesca Morvillo Falcone high school . Panic: Emergency services and passers-by rush to help those injured in the blast . Brindisi chief prosecutor in charge of the investigation said it now appeared unlikely that either the Sicilian Mafia or the United Sacred Crown, were involved. Marco Dinapoli said: 'The most probable hypothesis is that it was an isolated act. It seems improbable, not entirely to be excluded, that it is connected with mafia networks. He also said that attacks on other schools appeared unlikely and that police already had a facial composite picture of a suspect connected to the blast. Suspicions of mafia involvement were fed not only by the fact that the school was named after the wife of a murdered anti-mafia judge, but also by the timing. The attack took place days before the 20th anniversary of the couple's death in a bomb attack in Sicily. Thousands took to the streets in demonstrations of sympathy and outrage at the mafia on Saturday - but Dinapoli said it was still unclear what had prompted the attack. He said investigators had acquired 'significant' video evidence that suggested one man had set off the device which exploded as pupils were getting off a bus for the start of lessons on Saturday morning. The footage showed a man of about 50 years of age activating a remote control to detonate a rudimentary bomb made of three gas canisters hidden in a container outside the school gates, he said. 'It could be a person who feels at war with the world. It could be someone who wants to create tension for some ideological reason,' Dinapoli said. Mourning: Flowers are placed outside the school in Brindisi where the blast happened . Tributes: Dozens of Melissa Bassi's friends have left tributes on her Facebook page . The devices were hidden in a bin about 30metres from the Brindisi courthouse and as they exploded students arriving for lessons caught the full impact of the blasts. Debris was scattered over a wide area with shrapnel from the canisters piercing shutters of nearby shops and blowing out windows of apartment buildings overlooking the scene. TV footage showed scenes of desperation as shoes and rucksacks were scattered over the floor, abandoned by the students as the bombs went off just as students arrived for lessons. Although security across Italy has been stepped up with fears of anarchist attacks due to the drastic economic situation the theory quickly gathering momentum was a never before heard of attack on innocent schoolchildren by the mafia. Demonstration: Local residents protest the explosion near the high school today . Search begins: Firefighters and forensic officers investigate the shrapnel-covered scene . Blame: Brindisi's mayor, Mimmo Consales, accused the mafia or carrying out the attack, but officials later ruled out organised criminal involvement in the attack . Concealed: The devices were hidden in a bin about 30m from the Brindisi courthouse . One eye witness who works in the court building which overlooks the school told Italian media: 'I was just opening the window when the blast caught me in full. 'When I looked down I saw all the kids on the floor, they were covered in black and their books were on fire. It was an infernal scene. Who could have done something like this ? They were just kids.' Prime Minister Mario Monti cut short a visit to the United States to return home to cope with the aftermath of both the attack and an earthquake in northern Italy in which at least six people died. In shocked Brindisi, a port town on Italy's Adriatic coast where ferries leave for Greece, photographs of a smiling Melissa were posted around the city and businesses carrying signs declaring they were in mourning. People placed flowers at police barriers around the 1970s-era school where pupils study fashion, tourism and social services. Devastating: Shrapnel pierced shutters of nearby shops as the blast blew out windows of apartments . Blast: Two powerful explosions scattered deadly shrapnel across a wide area just as students were arriving for lessons at Morvillo Falcone school . Another girl injured in the attack, Veronica Capodieci, has been transferred to a hospital in the larger city of Lecce. She is still in serious condition, but the hospital reported on Sunday that she was stable and had regained consciousness. The deadly attack on a group of young students was shock the whole country at a time when it is already grappling with economic unrest and political scandals. Franco Scoditti, the mayor of Melissa's home town of Mesagne, near Brindisi, said: 'The school is a symbol of innocence and hope. 'The moment a school is attacked you have to ask yourself where things are heading.' Shocked: One eyewitness said: 'It was an infernal scene. Who could have done something like this? They were just kids' Investigation: Italian firefighters inspect the site where an explosive device went off .","Initial suggestions of mafia involvement in the bombing have since been played down by officials .

The former Navy SEAL who has written an explosive book about his role in the assassination of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden has been warned he could face legal action from the Pentagon. The Pentagon told the ex-SEAL - widely named as Team Six member Matt Bissonnette - his decision to write about the raid on bin Laden's Pakistan hideout put him in 'material breach' of non-disclosure agreements he signed with the Navy, even though he is no longer in the military. It added that it is considering legal action against all those 'acting in concert' with the SEAL - who uses the pseudonym Mark Owen - on his book 'No Easy Day', which is due to be released on Tuesday. Concealed identity: The former soldier was said to have been heavily disguised by make-up artists to film an interview with 60 Minutes about his book ahead of its release. It is set to air in the U.S. on September 9 . The former soldier originally used the alias . Mark Owen to protect his anonymity, but shortly after the book was announced he was identified by FoxNews.com as 36-year-old Matt Bissonnette. A . letter penned by Jeh Johnson, general counsel for the U.S. Department of . Defense, warned the former SEAL that disclosure of classified . information 'constitutes a violation of federal criminal law'. 'In . the judgment of the Department of Defense, you are in material breach . and violation of the non-disclosure agreements you signed,' the letter . said. 'Further public dissemination of your book will aggravate your breach and violation of your agreements.' Johnson said the Pentagon is considering pursuing 'all remedies legally available to us', according to ABC News. Raid: A team of Navy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011 (file photo) The letter, which was addressed to the author's pseudonym, said the fact that 'Owen' signed two non-disclosure agreements in 2007 meant that he is under a continuing obligation to 'never divulge' classified information. 'This commitment remains in force even after you left the active duty Navy,; the letter said. Johnson said that, in signing the agreements, the former SEAL had effectively given his assurance that he would 'submit any manuscript to the Pentagon for a security review, as well as obtain permission'. 'Owen' has previously said his book does not betray any sensitive information. The book's publisher has said it was vetted by a 'former special operations attorney'.Though the former SEAL said he will donate a majority of the book's profits to charities that help the families of fallen SEALs, the letter suggested that all of the book's royalties belong to the government.In signing his non-disclosure agreements, the former SEAL acknowledged he 'assigned to the U.S. government ... all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from a disclosure, publication or revelation of classified information not consistent with the terms of this agreement', the letter said.

A two-year-old toddler discovered up a bag of cocaine while she played at a children’s centre. The two-year-old girl was spotted clutching the bag of class A drug during a play session at Charlestown and Lower Kersal Sure Start Centre in Salford. Shocked staff dialled 999 and police sent the bag for testing, which revealed it contained cocaine. Horror in the nursery: The two-year-old girl was spotted with the class A drug during a play session at Charlestown and Lower Kersal Sure Start Centre (pictured) in Salford . She was one of eight youngsters attending Oakland Day Nursery at the centre, on St Aidan’s Road. Salford mayor Ian Stewart said staff had acted ‘quickly and professionally’ by removing the package and informing police. He said: 'The package was intact and still sealed so thankfully there was no indication that any children had been harmed by the powder. However, we do take situations like this very seriously and we are doing all we can to support the police with their investigation.' The children are understood to have been in a public area of the Sure Start centre at the time, and were being supervised by two members of nursery staff. The class A drug was discovered and immediately sent to the police, who are investigating . The horrified mother of one toddler who was in the class said: 'I got a call saying that they had found a bag of cocaine and they had no idea where it came from. 'It’s disgusting. It’s a nursery. You expect your kid to be safe when they are there and you place your trust in them.' Julia Johnston, manager at the Oakland Day Nursery, said: 'Safeguarding procedures were, as always, in place. The safety of our children is paramount. Our staff are very vigilant and spotted that the girl was holding the bag straight away.' Detective Chief Inspector Dave Riddick said: 'We understand that any parent will be concerned by this, but I want to reassure them that no child was harmed. 'Also there is no indication that anyone has been using or dealing drugs in the centre’s grounds. Inquiries are ongoing.' The centre, housed in a newly refurbished building in Lower Kersal Primary School, offers a baby clinic, baby massage and parents group as well as other family-based group sessions.","Little girl was spotted holding bag of powder at a play group in Salford .

A New Mexico politician with a surname remarkably similar to shamed former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner is in hot water after a professional photographer snapped him with a group of scantily-clad young women. Michael Wiener, who serves as the Republican Bernalillo County Commissioner, is now facing calls to resign after the provocative photograph. Layover? Commissioner Michael Wiener of New Mexico, centre, claims he was posing with 'bar girls' in the Philippines at the photographer's request and was only in Angeles City because of a layover . The photo in question was taken by Seattle-based photographer John Keatley, who was in Angeles City in the Philippines to document the thriving sex tourism industry there. History: Michael Wiener serves as the Republican Bernalillo County Commissioner in New Mexico . Wiener vehemently denied the claims, telling Albuquerque station KOB, which first broke the sensational story, that he was only in the red light district for a few hours while he waited for his next flight. He said: ‘We went there to take a look… walk up Walking Street and then went to the airport.’ The commissioner said he was only touring the district with his fiancée during a layover. They were flying to see his daughter, the commissioner said. The picture of him and the woman he identified as his fiancée may be viewed on Mr Keatley’s personal blog, along with other photos of Angeles City’s red-light district. According to Mr Keatley, Wiener first identified the woman accompanying him as his girlfriend. However, when KOB looked into his flight schedules, they could not find a flight schedule to Caticlan, where his daughter was. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Wiener would not say whether or not he knew he was wandering around the red-light district. He did say that he ‘just wanted to take a quick tour,’ comparing it to people wanting to see the casinos at Las Vegas, even if they didn’t gamble. Mr Keatley, who works as a professional photographer who shoots portraits and advertising, told a different tale. He told TPM's Muckraker blog ‘it was very obvious to me that (Wiener) was not respectful to women. He was there to have a good time.’ The photographer said that people travel the world over to visit the city’s booming red light district.He said that he heard Wiener making inappropriate jokes to the women – called ‘bar girls’ – suggesting that one of them touch his penis. Wiener vehemently denied the claim. ‘I may have made a comment like don’t get too close to my girlfriends here, but I didn’t mention anything like that,’ Wiener told KOB. The other Weiner: Former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) was forced to resign after a series of illicit photos were posted to his Twitter account; he is seen speaking in June of last year . Laid bare: Weiner denied claims that he sent a picture of his bulging underwear to a young woman, but confessed last June that was, in fact, him . He also issued a statement Thursday that read: ‘I’m a hard-working commissioner who has a right to take a vacation, to visit my fiancée and my daughter. I did absolutely nothing wrong-  I was a tourist on my own time – not there on county business (sic) my time is my time!’ In the statement, he rhetorically asked: ‘If I was doing something wrong – why would I pose for a picture?’ Now, Wiener is facing considerable heat to resign from his public office position. Michelle Lujan Grishman, who serves as a commissioner with the New Mexico State Bar, said the photos call for Wiener’s resignation. She told KOB: ‘During most of his career at the county, there have been allegations of inappropriate behaviour that borders on racism, sexual harassment, hostile work environments, and these pictures seem to condemn human trafficking and then exploitation of women.’ Last year, Wiener was cleared in an investigation after a female staffer complained that he made off-colour, sexually explicit comments to her, saying: ‘Did you know that the (County Commission) now has a Wiener and a Johnson on it?’ Though he admitted that he made the statement, Wiener said it was intended to be taken as a joke.The Albuquerque Journal noted another gaffe, where he referred to a Santa Fe man as ‘VERY Hispanic and NOT very sophisticated – very very BLUE Collar.’ During their encounter in the red-light district, Mr Keatley was unaware that Wiener was a politician, and had no idea who he was until Wiener handed him his email address and requested that Mr Keatley send him the photos. Wiener is up for re-election this year.","New Mexico commissioner Michael Wiener photographed with four Filipino 'bar girls' on recent trip .

A death row inmate, convicted of killing his wife and unborn son, is appealing his death sentence, maintaining his claim of innocence. Scott Peterson filed the automatic appeal of his 2004 death sentence to the California Supreme Court on Thursday, saying, as he always has, that he had nothing to do with the murders of Laci, his wife, and Conner, the child she was carrying. Peterson's attorney, noted death penalty lawyer Cliff Gardner, filed the 423-page document eight years after a San Mateo County jury found the former fertilizer salesman guilty of suffocating Laci and dumping her in the San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve 2002. Death sentence: Scott Peterson was convicted in 2004 of the murder of his wife, Laci, and their unborn son . Gardner claims that the overwhelming publicity Peterson's trial received, incorrect evidentiary rulings and other mistakes deprived him of a fair trial. The murderer was convicted in 2004 after a trial that his attorney argues surpassed the O.J. Simpson murder trial in terms of publicity. Such was the hype surrounding the trial that it was ordered moved from Stanislaus County of the Petersons' home, to San Mateo County. But Gardner argued that the trial should have been moved yet again because of the crush of publicity in San Mateo County. 'Before hearing even a single . witness, nearly half of all prospective jurors admitted they had already . decided Mr. Peterson was guilty of capital murder,' Gardner argues. And in what may be a first for the . American system of justice, outside the courthouse in which the parties . would try to select a fair jury, a radio station posted a large . billboard which had a telephone number for people to call in and vote . 'whether Peterson was a man or monster'. Inmate: Scott Peterson was transported to San Quentin Prison death row after he was formally sentenced to death for the murder or his wife Laci and their unborn son . Resident: The East Block Condemned Row II at San Quentin State Prison in San Quentin California, where Peterson is housed as he awaits his execution . Peterson was pictured in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit. 'The publicity continued throughout . trial,' Gardner argued. 'A mob estimated at more than 1,000 people . gathered at the courthouse to await the guilt phase verdict. 'After the guilty verdict was . announced, the 12 jurors departing to await the beginning of the penalty . phase - and decide whether Mr. Peterson would live or die - were met . with wild applause and cheering.' Beyond issues with the publicity, . Gardner argues the judge made several erroneous evidentiary decisions . and other rulings that led to Peterson receiving an unfair trial. Gardner notes that Peterson was . convicted and sentenced to death even though investigators never . directly proved 'how, where or when' the murder occurred. Prosecutors told the jury that Laci was killed sometime between the night of December 23, 2002 and the following morning. They believed she was suffocated in her home, but Gardner argues that there was little direct evidence collected at the house to support that theory. Peterson claims that Laci was killed . sometime after he left their Modesto home the morning of December 24, . 2002 to go fishing in the San Francisco Bay. Highly publicised: Scott Peterson has always maintained his innocence and claims he did not get a fair trial . Innocent?: Peterson claims that Laci was killed sometime after he left their Modesto home the morning of December 24, 2002 to go fishing in the San Francisco Bay. Gardner goes on to complain that the judge automatically excluded prospective jurors who said they opposed the death penalty. He argues that those jurors should have been questioned more about whether they could still decide the case fairly. Gardner also claims that some of the prosecution's strongest evidence should never have been shown to the jury. For instance, Gardner alleges that the police dog who picked up Laci's scent at the Berkeley Marina 'even though the dog had a dismal record of being wrong a remarkable 66 per cent of the time.' The thick legal brief delves into numerous other issues alleging incorrect rulings, juror misconduct and other errors. All death penalty cases are appealed to the California Supreme Court, which is struggling to keep up with the pace of cases. There are 725 inmates on Death Row and no prisoner has been executed in California since January 2006. Lawsuits in federal and state courts have temporarily halted executions.The appeal is expected to take months, if not years, to be resolved.","Scott Peterson was convicted in 2004 of murdering his wife, Laci, and their unborn son Conner on Christmas Eve 2002 .

The sheer scale of worklessness in Britain was laid bare today as one in three households in some cities are completely jobless. Liverpool has the highest rate for the fourth year running with more than 50,000 homes in this dire situation, and some contain families who have never worked a day in their lives. Experts say that former industrial areas of the UK have hundreds of thousands of households with generations of people who have been out of work for up to 40 years. Best and worst: New figures have shown the scale of unemployed households in some areas of Britain . Official figures released by the Office for National Statistics paint a depressing regional picture, with communities in the north-east, Wales, Scotland and parts of London having the largest number of completely unemployed homes. In Liverpool homes, with someone aged between 16 and 64, 31.6 per cent of them were completely workless in 2011. South Teesside, which includes Middlesborough and Redcar, had a 29.1 per cent rate - the second highest . percentage - up from a ranking of fourth a year . earlier. The highest percentage of workless households in Wales was in the . Central Valleys, and this area was the third highest across the UK, where 28.7 per cent of . households were workless. Deprived: Liverpool is one of the poorest areas of Britain and has consistently had the highest unemployed household rates . Glasgow topped in Scotland and has the fourth highest rate in Britain at 28.7 per . cent, followed by Sunderland, which completed the top five. The main reasons given by people was long term sickness, disability or just not being able to get a job. 'The common link among the areas within the top five is that they were . all heavily industrialised in the last century,' the ONS said today, . 'Liverpool had a large . manufacturing base and one of the UK’s largest docks, which have both . been in decline since the 1970s. South Teesside has also seen a decline . in the heavy industries that dominated the area in the last century. The . Central Valleys were once one of the UK’s largest coal producers, most . of which no longer exists. 'Glasgow was once a major force in . shipbuilding as well as other engineering but competition overseas has . seen that decline since the 1960s. Finally Sunderland was also affected . by the loss of shipbuilding and coal mining as seen is some of the other . areas.' Up and down: This official graph shows how areas with historic levels of worklessness have fared over the years and where they were ranked up to 2011 . In 2011, the lowest percentage of workless households in the UK were mainly . concentrated in the south of England. Oxfordshire had the lowest percentage, at eight per cent followed by . Buckinghamshire, on 9.8 per cent. Both these areas have commonly had low . rates of workless households since records began in 2004.

The . Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this was 3.7 million in 2012 - . down 153,000 on a year earlier.

Jailed: Pensioner Margaret Harvey was sentenced to four weeks behind bars for stalking hospital boss Julia Bridgewater . A woman who harassed medical staff over her husband’s death has been jailed. Margaret Harvey, 74, bombarded a hospital chief executive with late-night phone calls after her beloved Graham died of a heart attack. She also traced the home of a retired cardiologist who had treated him – and then turned up at the front door armed with a wooden meat tenderiser. Yesterday she was jailed for four weeks after staging a courtroom protest, but telling the judge: ‘I think to be honest I would be better going to prison.’ Mr Harvey, a retired PE teacher, died in March 2004 after having a heart attack at the wheel of his car. He had previously been treated for a heart attack while on holiday in France. He was later diagnosed with angina at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire and put on a waiting list for an angiogram. Following his death, his wife made a formal complaint against the hospital, saying doctors had failed to spot extensive scarring to the left ventricle of his heart and that he should have undergone a heart bypass. Inquiries were made by the health authority, the General Medical Council and the ombudsman but no fault was attached to the hospital. Harvey, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, took out a number of private prosecutions which proved unsuccessful. Eventually she hired a private detective to trace the addresses and phone numbers of officials she felt ‘had the answers’ to her husband’s death. Margaret Harvey holds a photo of . her dead husband Graham, having refused to apologise for her behaviour . in remaining adamant that his death was the fault of Julia Bridgewater . In 2010, she armed herself with  a meat tenderiser and travelled 220 miles to confront Dr John Davis at his retirement home in Saltash, Cornwall. She was later given a two-year restraining order and told not to contact him. Then, for a six-month period starting in November last year, she bombarded hospital chief executive Julia Bridgewater with phone calls demanding answers. Mother-of-three Mrs Bridgewater – who did not even join the hospital management team until 2006 – was so frightened by the calls she asked police to fit panic alarms at her home. Despite being warned by police to stop, Harvey continued and was eventually arrested.

In an interview before she was jailed, Harvey said: ‘I don’t regret what I did. I believe if my husband had been given proper treatment he would have had another ten years of life or more. ‘I want the hospital to admit the care was not good enough and I want the people responsible held to account.’ Harvey admitted harassment at North Staffordshire magistrates’ court and was jailed and given an indefinite restraining order barring her from contacting Mrs Bridge-water or going near her home. District Judge David Taylor told Harvey: ‘I recognise that your motivation was to seek answers over what you see as wrongs relating to the death of your husband but  that right to protest is subject to the rule of law, no matter what we may feel about injustice.’ Despite the fact that Julia Bridgewater, left, . did not start her job at the hospital until two years after Graham, . husband of Margaret Harvey, right, died, Mrs Harvey she ordered a . private investigator to follow her .","Margaret Harvey harassed NHS boss Julia Bridgewater for six months .

Just 76.1 per cent from the UK are educated to A-level standard - against 92 per cent in Lithuania . The University and College Union, which . unearthed the figures, said the UK faces falling further behind the rest of . Europe because of higher university tuition fees and restrictions on university . places. The statistics show that in 2010, 76.1 per . cent of UK adults were educated to this level, compared with 92 per cent in . Lithuania, 91.1 per cent in the Czech Republic, 91 per cent in Slovakia and . 89.2 per cent in Estonia - the nations at the top of the table. Other nations ahead of the UK included . Germany, Austria and Luxembourg. Despite the widely held opinion that A-levels have been dumbed down over recent years, it is still regarded as a more of a 'gold standard' compared to the four 'matura' exams taken at the same level by students in Lithuania. UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: . 'The UK should be at the top of the table when it comes to education.

Schools . Minister Nick Gibb said ‘shadows of Charles Dickens’s world’ persisted . in the country’s poorest areas despite major social advances. Expectations . of children moving through the school system were too ‘modest’, with . teachers settling too often for a ‘good enough’ standard, he claimed. The result was under-achievement by thousands of youngsters, with one in six still struggling to read fluently by the age of 11. In . a speech on the 200th anniversary of the author’s birth, Mr Gibb warned . that, just as in Victorian times, literacy problems were ‘heavily . orientated towards the poorest in our communities’. ‘We need – if you’ll forgive the Dickens pun – much greater expectations of children in reading,’ he added. He . also said pupils at primary school should be encouraged to read . ‘complex’ books by authors such as Michael Morpurgo, Jacqueline Wilson . and Roald Dahl, while secondary pupils should read at least one Dickens . novel during their teens. Classic . works of literature were being ignored, he warned, with tens of . thousands of pupils gaining GCSEs in English literature without studying . any books written before the 20th century. More than 90 per cent of answers on . novels in English literature papers were on the same three works – Of . Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies and To Kill a Mockingbird. Out . of more than 300,000 who took the country’s most popular paper last . year, just 1,236 read Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, 285 read Thomas . Hardy’s Far from the Madding Crowd and 187 read Emily Bronte’s . Wuthering Heights. ‘Unfortunately, . even when young people do wish to read, the exam system does not . encourage them,’ Mr Gibb said. Despite a wide curriculum, ‘the English . Literature GCSE only actually requires students to study four or five . texts, including one novel’. He also claimed children in England were . ‘falling out of love’ with reading. A study of 65 developed nations ranked the UK at 47th for the number of children who read for pure enjoyment, he said. Some 40 per cent of pupils did not read for pleasure, against just 10 per cent in Kazakhstan and Albania. Mr . Gibb said the current target set for 11-year-olds at the end of primary . school – that they reach level four in reading – was too ‘modest’. Youngsters should aspire to the elite level five, he said. A . survey of 500 employers by the Confederation of British Industry last . year found that 42 per cent were dissatisfied with school-leavers’ basic . skills, while army recruiting officers have warned that hundreds of . would-be soldiers have been turned away for failing basic literacy and . numeracy tests. Mr Gibb’s . speech came as he launched a national reading competition designed to . encourage seven to 12-year-olds – especially boys – to read more . fiction.","UK ranked 19th out of 33 countries by Eurostat .

Neighbours have told how they were woken in the middle of the night by Alex Reid attempting to force his way in to the Essex home he shares with Chantelle Houghton. And the stress of the last few days was clear to see on the 29-year-old reality star's face as she left her house for the first time since the dramatic incident earlier today (Thursday). There was no doubt the usually bubbly blonde looked a far cry from her normal self, with her downcast expression proving just how painful the experience has been for Chantelle. Pained: Chantelle Houghton looked downcast as she left her home in Brentwood, Essex, with daughter Dolly in tow earlier today (Thursday) Moving on: Alex Reid kept his head down as he stepped out for the first time since his arrest earlier today . But ever the doting mother, the former Celebrity Big Brother star lavished attention on her two-month-old daughter Dolly as she prepared to drive off in her Range Rover. Dressed in a pair of leather panel leggings with a black mesh long-sleeve top and simple flat sandals, the star was evidently determined not to let the events of the last few days get in the way of her mothering duties. With little Dolly in tow, Chantelle made her way to a local branch of Mothercare, where she picked up a birthday present ahead of taking her little one to a party later in the afternoon. Stressed: The worry of the past few days was evident on Chantelle's face as she stepped out for the first time since Alex Reid's arrest . Doting: Chantelle put on a brave face as she took little Dolly to a birthday party this afternoon . And despite putting on a brave face for the sake of her daughter, it was abundantly clear the main worry on Chantelle's mind was the state of her relationship. Alex also stepped out for the first time this afternoon, and made sure to keep his head down as he wandered through the streets on his mobile phone while attempting to shield his face with a baseball cap. The 37-year-old cage fighter was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage at the couple's home in the early hours of yesterday morning (Wednesday) after local residents awoke to a 'screaming' commotion between the pair. One neighbour told the Daily Star: 'I could hear a man shouting and when I looked out I saw Alex Reid.

Meanwhile, another neighbour near the couple's home in Brentwood, Essex, admitted to finding the incident 'quite frightening'. She added: 'I’m used to them making noise late at night but I only usually hear cars coming back and forth and sometimes a bit of loud talking. 'This time I heard banging and lots of shouting. I live on my own so it was quite frightening.' No comment: Alex Reid posted a statement about the incident on his official website . Alex has since been released by Essex Police without charge. In a statement on his official website, he said: 'In the early hours of this morning Alex was arrested at the address he shares with his partner, Chantelle Houghton after she called police following a disturbance. 'The reasons for Alex’s arrest have been widely publicised and in some cases inaccurate and based on conjecture. 'Alex considers this a private matter and therefore is not prepared to comment on it save to say that he assisted police with their inquiries and following that, the police have taken no further action.'

Chantelle told the new issue of OK! magazine: 'Things have been really strained. There's never a day without drama.' Testing times: Chantelle and Alex have made no secret of the fact that their 16-month relationship is somewhat turbulent at present . In an interview with New! magazine this week, Alex admitted he had made mistakes in his relationship with Chantelle: . He said: 'I’m doing everything in my power to make it work. I’ve made bad mistakes and choices.' The couple have been dating for 16 months, and have run into several problems throughout the course of their relationship. Chantelle was furious when she discovered Alex had been exchanging private, but innocent, Twitter messages with model Amy Willerton - former protogee of his ex-wife Katie Price. The former Paris Hilton lookalike also admitted she has also been upset by Alex being groped by a drag queen as he performed in a gay club.

Gardeners have been warned to wash their hands after using compost following a cluster of cases of deadly Legionnaires disease. A rare strain of the illness has killed one man in Scotland and made five others ill in the past five years. While the risk is small, experts urged gardeners to take simple precautions such as wearing gloves and a dust mask while potting plants. Handle with care: Gardeners have today been warned to wash their hands after using compost due to a rare strain of Legionnaire's disease that has infected six people in Scotland . This strain has been linked to compost  in Australia and New Zealand but these are the first British victims thought to be affected. All of the sufferers were keen gardeners, and doctors across the UK have been alerted to ask about compost if they see patients with unusual pneumonia. The Royal Horticultural Society has advised people to wash their hands thoroughly after handling soil, compost, fertiliser or pesticides. Symptoms of Legionella longbeachae include headaches, diarrhoea or a dry cough followed by pneumonia. Most people recover after taking a course of antibiotics. The rare form of Legionella longbeachae cannot be detected through normal tests. It is normally caused by the bug Legionella pneumophili, which lives naturally in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, and can also be found in man-made structures containing water such as air conditioning systems . Its chief adviser Guy Barter said elderly people and those with weakened immune systems were most at risk from Legionnaires – a deadly respiratory infection which causes a high fever, muscle pain and a persistent cough. He said: ‘We’d suggest not opening bags of compost or potting media with your head right over and to consider wearing a dust mask when turning compost heaps.’ The strain, called legionella longbeachae, is found naturally in soil but very rarely causes disease in this country. More than 98 per cent of cases are caused by legionella pneumonophila bacteria. Both forms are spread by tiny water droplets in the air. They are not contagious and can be treated with antibiotics if caught early – but around one in ten cases are fatal. In 2010, doctors in Paisley, Scotland, told how a previously healthy 67-year-old man came in to hospital with the rare strain after an eight-day fever. They told the Lancet medical journal the man, who survived, was a keen gardener who had cut his index finger while planting with compost. Dr Martin Donaghy, medical director of Health Protection Scotland, said: ‘We need to take steps to reduce the risk.’","One man has died and five taken ill in unrelated cases .

As he told the perplexed crowd, Tom Arnold hasn't been in the same room as his ex-wife Roseanne Barr for 17 years so when he showed up her Comedy Central roast... even she was lost for words. The sharp-tongued comic appeared genuinely . surprised when Arnold took the stage near the end of her taping. What a difference a couple of decades make: Tom Arnold shocked everyone - including ex-wife Roseanne Barr - by appearing as a surprise guest at her Comedy Central Roast . 'We have not been in the same room . for over 17 years,' 53-year-old told Arnold the audience after taking to the stage. His roast went against the grain, and the comedian, whose marriage to Barr collapsed in the most acrimonious way possible, waxed lyrical about the star, 59. After receiving a standing ovation, Arnold wondered out loud: 'Is this really the best format to do this? Getting together with your ex at a roast.' But Roseanne was clearly touched by his appearance. 'I'd really like to thank Tom for . showing up. It was very brave and he was very funny,' Roseanne said when . she took the stage to sup up the roast. They can laugh now: The couple's acrimonious split wad depressingly mirthless . 'White trash Camelot': That's how Tom described his life with the famous comedian . However, her acerbic touch had returned and she said of the man she hired to work in a plum role on her eponymous hit show: 'But Jesus Christ how many . jobs do I have to get that guy?' Arnold did offer a recap of their 'white-trash Camelot' life together before tackling their sex life and gently poking fun at his former wife's notorious temper. Tom had previously ruled himself out of an appearance at the roast, which made it all the more surprising. And after the couple's acrimonious split, nobody was much surprised. Tom ended his surprise appearance with . complimentary comments about Roseanne's rise to fame after . appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, declaring, 'Roseanne, you were my Johnny Carson,' and then thanking her 'from the . bottom of my heart' for launching his career. So happy together: The couple married in 1990 and seemed to be made for each other, initially . Mixing business with pleasure: It wasn't long before Roseanne had given Tom a job on her titular hit sitcom . Jane Lynch served as Master of . Ceremonies at the event, and used the opportunity to make a dig at the . Chick-fil-A anti-same-sex marriage controversy. Other celebrity roasters included . Carrie Fisher, Wayne Brady, Ellen Barkin, Katey Sagal, Gilbert . Gottfried, Jeffery Ross. The Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne airs August . 12 at 10 p.m. Barr, who now lives with partner Johnny Argent, in Hawaii initially seemed deliriously happy with Arnold. Moved on: Roseanne lives with her partner in Hawaii . The couple mud-wrestled for a Vanity Fair cover before showing off their tattooed backsides to a stadium full of '89 World Series fans. But before long there were reports of screaming rows on the set of Roseanne after its titular star employed her younger husband as an executive producer. She then fired him on the spot after accusing him of having an affair with his assistant, and before long she filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. She wrote in the papers: 'I now realize that I have been a classic battered and abused wife.' 'Throughout our marriage [Tom] hit me, struck me, has thrown objects at me, pinched me and verbally abused me.' This led to a showdown, when he allegedly stormed onto the set to confront her, scratching and hitting four people before he was finally escorted off the premises. Roseanne also demanded a restraining order against Tom. 'I am extremely afraid for my physical safety,' she said. Her petition was granted. Arnold later claimed that he and Roseanne were fine and that she was unaware of the charges made by her lawyers, but admitted they had slanging matches on set. His relationship with assistant Kim Silva also caused problems, despite her being so close to Roseanne that they offered up a mock three way wedding. Friends of the couple also doubted the claims of abuse and Roseanne herself recalled that she became detached from reality during this period. Comedy Central will be cutting a joke told by Jeffrey Ross at the roast when it airs because it refers to the Aurora shooting and alleged murderer James Holmes. Ross was heckling fellow comedian Seth Green when he compared him to the alleged shooter. 'Seth, congratulations. This is actually a great night for you,' Ross said according to the Hollywood Reporter. 'You haven't gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in Aurora.' Seth Green was also there to roast Barr and was picked out by Ross for his red hair. Ross was comparing Green's hair to the dyed orange hair of James Holmes. Ross went on to say that he was only joking. He then added, 'You are not like James Holmes. At least he did something in a movie theater that people remember!' Showbiz Roundup!

Addressing reports that he and Alesha, 33, had a massive fallout after news of his infidelities surfaced, Harvey, 33, said: 'Since the day that I actually got divorced there’s never been one . cross word or beef. 'I got off lightly, she dealt with it graciously.' Cheater: Alesha and the rapper (left) wed in 2005 but their marriage collapsed when it was revealed he had been unfaithful with singer Javine (right) However, Harvey also opened up about the pain he felt when Dixon, who he dated for five years before getting married, eventually left without even putting up a fight. He said: 'What made it worse is when she went I'll . take what's mine and you take what's yours and get out of my life, and I . was like ""oh!""' Speaking highly of her loyal nature, Harvey added: 'I . was that girl’s world. Her eyes didn't go left her eyes didn't go right; I was her man, I was her husband.' MC Harvey and singer Javine, with whom he co-starred in West End show Daddy Cool, went on to have daughter Angel in 2008. Adding her two cents: Jasmine told Harvey that it was good that they didn't have children otherwise his affair would have been received far worse . Harvey added to his CBB housemates that the thing he was most upset about was the hurt he caused by lying in church on the day he married Alesha. He continued: 'I regret the pain that I caused. I . lied to God as we got married in a church.' The 33-year-old also confessed that cheating on the Britain's Got Talent judge has made finding love harder, as he has since struggled to settle down. He added: 'What makes it worse, every . time I get serious with a girl they go back to that moment.' Adding her two cents, Jasmine said the fact the couple didn't have children made his affair OK, as she believed he would have never cheated if they did have a family together. The 27-year-old said: 'I don’t believe you would have done that if kids were involved.' Not happy: Rhian Sugden took to the Diary Room to talk about how she was after her fallout with Jasmine . Also in Tuesday night's CBB round-up, Jasmine's attitude was all the contestants could talk about, following her blow up last night with Rhian Sugden. Coronation Street legend Julie Goodyear referred to her as 'looney' and Julian Clary said that he was doing his best to avoid her. At the start of the episode Rhian took to the Diary Room to talk about how she was feeling after her row with Jasmine. Feeling drained: Julie Goodyear told the glamour model that Jasmine's attitude was tiring . When questioned about how she was feeling, she told Big Brother: 'I feel horrific today because of what happened last night. I can’t help but feel bad on Jasmine.' Upset at the whole situation she continued: 'Why should everyone have to tip toe around her? I don’t like confrontation. 'It’s draining for the rest of the house, unnecessary drama and it has to be me who has to deal with it. She’s this feisty Queen of the Damned.' 'She's trying to fake me': Harvey told Ashley McKenzie that he believed Jasmine was using him . And at the end of the show, Harvey told Olympian Ashley McKenzie that he believed the feisty model was 'fake' as they sat in the hot tub. The MC said: 'This girl . is trying to use me, now she’s trying to fake me. I listen ‘cos I’m a . nice guy but she’s trying to fake me.' Brand new: The feisty model took to the Diary Room to reveal that she believed she was changing for the better . Meanwhile in the Diary Room , the model was boasting about the fact that she felt people in the house liked her. Jasmine said: 'These people have changed me for the better, its hardcore emotional boot camp sort of stuff, it’s hard. They are seeing my madness and my badness. I’m finding people are coming to me completing and encouraging me. 'There’s people that like me here and that’s really cool,' she smiled.

She's already made a solo porn film in a bid to pay her astronomical bills to raise her 14 children. And over the weekend, Nadya 'Octomom' Suleman went to yet another desperate length in a bid to fund her family - by stripping. The single mother, 37, was reportedly paid $5,000 (£3,220) to strip down to just her knickers as she grinded on-stage to the sounds of Rihanna at a Florida club on Friday night. Dance for me: Octomom Nadya Suleman makes her stripping debut at The Playhouse Gentleman's Club in Miami, Florida on Friday night . You can leave your pants on: Nadya remove her PVC bra as she dances around the pole . Making her debut on Friday 13th, Nadya was showered with dollar bills as she came out on stage at The Playhouse Gentlemen's Club in Miami. For her first dance, she wore an Eyes Wide Shut-inspired PVC ensemble of mask, thigh-high boots, corset, bra and pants, while carrying a riding crop. She then removed her outfit to the sound's of Rihanna's S&M, ending up in just her boots and knickers. Is that enough to feed your kids? Nadya looks thrilled with the money being thrown at her . I'm a bad, bad girl: Octomom's second dance saw her dress as a sexy schoolgirl . For her second dance, she changed . into a sexy schoolgirl costume of pigtails, knee-high stockings and . checked skirt as she performed to Rihanna's Rude Boy. However, it appeared lapdancing isn't as easy as it looks, with Nadya apparently struggling to maintain a sense of rhythm. One fellow dancer told the Miami Herald newspaper: . 'She's really stiff .Oh my God, she can’t dance. But it’s good for the . rest of us girls because she made it a busy Friday night. We’re going to . get extra tips.' Good time girl: Wearing PVC under those hot lights, no wonder she wanted to disrobe . At one point, a fellow stripper had to help her remove her gloves as she struggled to remove the clingy PVC material. Apparently the West Park club ended up attracting 400 customers - twice as many punters as usual. As . well as the chance to pay $200 for a private one-to-one dance from the . mother-of-14, customers could also buy 'I saw Octomom naked at the . Playhouse South' T-shirts. Helping hand: Nadya's friend Adam Barta helps her squeeze into her PVC outfit backstage . She's got some front: Nadya wears a very low-cut dress backstage as she adjusts her fishnets . Nadya was apparently paid $5,000 for two 12-minute sets, not including tips and then $10-a-time for autographs. Punters who wanted their photos taken with the burgeoning adult entertainment star had to pay $25. The . club owner Greg Louis said it had been a great coup for the club to . secure Nadya's performance: 'The phone’s been ringing off the hook. Several people asked me if it was really Octomom or just an . impersonator.' Baring all: Nadya went topless to the delight of the punters . Nadya was originally set to perform at rival club T's Lounge, but cancelled after the manageress reportedly made negative comments about the single mother. T's Lounge failed in a legal battle to ban her appearance after a Florida judge threw out the case on Thursday. Nadya's stripping role comes two months after she made a solo porn film Octomom: Uncovered. Show me the money: Nadya had the audience transfixed as she awkwardly grinded on stage . Nervous? Nadya looked quite calm backstage, despite making her stripping debut . In April, she reportedly filed for bankruptcy after running up to $1million in debts. Octomom leaped to fame in 2009 when it was revealed she conceived octuplets through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), despite having six other children, no job and no partner to support her. Despite her racy ventures, Nadya insists she has turned to God and will remain celibate until her children turn 18. Top billing: Octomom was quite the draw for the Miami club, which attracted twice the amount of punters as normal .

An Olympic gold medal won by a British rower who was the 'Steve Redgrave of 1908' has sold for an incredible £17,500. The medal was won at the 1908 London Games by British doctor and rower Raymond Etherington-Smith, the captain of the Leander eight. During the race, Mr Etherington-Smith's main rivals - the Belgium team - sunk and capsized, allowing the British team to row to victory. Raymond Etherington-Smith's gold medal, pictured, fetched a massive £17,500 . The medal, pictured, was expected to sell for £7,000 at Christie's in London . The 25g, 15 carat gold medal, which measures 1.5 inches in diameter, was not designed to be worn around the neck. One side of the medal depicts a soldier figure on horseback towering over a curled up dragon. The reverse shows a naked male athlete standing victorious, flanked by two topless women holding a wreath over his head. Etherington-Smith tragically died aged 36, just five years after his 1908 victory . The inscriptions 'Olympic Games' and 'London 1908' are scrawled either side of the athlete's feet on podium-like structures. It was announced just days before the 2012 London Games that the medal was put up for auction - more than a century after Mr Etherington-Smith beat his Belgian rivals in the 1908 race. The medal was sold by the rower’s family at Christie’s in London, far exceeding the £7,000 it was expected to fetch. The gold medallion at the London 2012 Olympics is only worth about £410 as raw metal. However, the real value would be much higher if it was ever sold. The London 2012 gold medal consists of just more than one per cent gold. The rest is made up of 92.5 per cent silver and 6.16 per cent copper. Mr Etherington-Smith has been likened to Sir Steve Redgrave, who won medals at five consecutive Olympic Games between 1984 and 2000. However, Mr Etherington-Smith contracted peritonitis while carrying out an operation at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London and tragically died five years after his triumph at the 1908 Games, aged just 36. An operating theatre was later named in his memory. Sophie Churche, from Christie’s, said before the sale: 'The medal is incredibly beautiful and is solid gold.' 'There were only two Olypmics where the medals were made from pure gold and this is 25 grams of 15 carat gold.' The 1908 rower has been likened to British Olympian Sir Steve Redgrave . 'On the front it depicts the male athlete being crowned and on the reverse is St George.' 'It was not meant to be worn around the neck, there is no loop for a ribbon to go through and this comes in its original box.' 'London only had a short time to organise the Games because they were due to be held in Italy by Mt Vesuvius erupted so they had to be moved.' 'This was won by Raymond Etherington-Smith who was captain of the Leander eight.' 'We chose an experienced crew to take on the Belgians who were the main competition.' 'In the end the Belgians capsized and the Great Britain crew won by two lengths.' 'Etherington-Smith competed for the London Rowing Club and was a member of their Thames Cup crew in 1895.' 'He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he rowed against Oxford in 1899 and 1900 and in his last year, when he was President, he rowed against his brother Thomas who was in the Oxford boat.' 'The medal is a fine work of art and is being sold by his great nephew and there will be collectors and museums who would like to have it.' Etherington-Smith's medal differs from those at 2012 Games, pictured .","Gold medal won by British doctor and rower Raymond Etherington-Smith, captain of the Leander eight .

At one point, Cochran wrote: ‘I can’t go on like this.’ Boyer told MailOnline that deputies were contacted by Ehlen, the estranged boyfriend, around 12:30am this morning at his home near De Soto, about 45 miles south of St. Louis.

"By . Claire Ellicott . PUBLISHED: . 20:03 EST, 5 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:46 EST, 6 September 2012 . Brave Captain Scott before his ill-fated journey . It is a tale of adventure and bravery that ended in tragedy. But a theory about Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the South Pole sheds a rather more sinister light on the subject. Academic Chris Turney, of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, says one of the team may have eaten more than his fair share of food, leaving the others starving. On their way to the Antarctic, the adventurers stored depots of food and fuel to sustain them on their return journey in February 1912. But Mr Turney has discovered archive material suggesting the men found less food than expected at a critical point on the way back. He suggests that this was because Teddy Evans, Scott’s second-in-command and one of three men who turned back before the final stretch, ate too much food. Starving and exhausted, Scott and three other men died just 18 kilometres from their final food depot. Had they reached it, they probably would have survived. Although it is already known that adventurers found food and fuel supplies unexpectedly low at some of the depots, Mr Turney claims he has new evidence of a further shortage. He also claims that this has been hushed up over the years and that a wife of one of Scott’s team erased notes her husband had made. His claim is based on notes from two meetings in April 1913 between George Curzon, president of the UK’s Royal Geographical Society, and the widows of Scott and team member Edward Wilson. In the first meeting, Kathleen Scott pointed out entries in her husband’s diary complaining about food shortages and the ‘lack of thoughtfulness’ of other members of the expedition. Polar Party: Intrepid Captain Scott, Oates, Wilson and Evans are pictured besides Amundsenís tent on their daring journey . The 'Terra Nova', the ship that carried Robert Falcon Scott on his exploration of the Antarctic . In a separate meeting, Oriana Wilson told Curzon that her husband’s diary contained a passage complaining of an ‘inexplicable’ shortage of food on the return journey on which he died. Mr Curzon also noted that Mrs Wilson was determined to keep the notes secret and that notes had been erased, possibly by the widow. Mr Turney believes Wilson was referring to a depot that Scott and the surviving men reached on 24 February 1912. He lays the blame with Mr Evans, who travelled south with Scott but turned back alongside two other men with about 200km to go. Captain Scott on board the Terra Nova with some of the expedition members and crew . Officers and crew pose at the stern of the Terra Nova, one of history's most famous ships, in New Zealand, 1910 . Mr Evans fell ill with scurvy on the return journey and had to be pulled on a sledge by his two companions, which may explain why they needed more food. Mr Turney also argues that this was all hushed up by Mr Curzon. He said: ‘Curzon could not risk the story getting out. Scott and his companions had been declared heroes. ‘To suggest that one of the returning teams had helped themselves to more than their fair share of food, contributing to the men’s deaths, would have changed everything.’ Scott’s diary for February 24 mentions a significant fuel shortage and, three days later, he writes that the team had less food than they expected to have. Mr Turney makes the claims in his book 1912: The year the world discovered Antarctica, published this week. But Roland Huntford, author of a dual biography of Scott and his Norwegian rival Roald Amundsen, disagrees that Mr Evans can be blamed. He said: ‘The food depots were badly organised and it would have been all but impossible for Evans and his men to know how much food was rightfully theirs. ‘It was entirely Scott’s fault because of poor organisation.’","Academic Chris Turney, of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, says one of the team may have eaten more than his fair share of food, leaving the others starving ."

Catching his eye: Both Geri and Russell performed at the extravaganza before chatting at the end and swapping numbers . A source told The Sun: 'Things are getting very serious between them — they’re a proper couple now. They had met several times in the past, but really got to know each other during the Olympics.' Brand was so smitten when he met up with Geri at the Olympics, he gushed: 'I’ve got a crush on Geri Halliwell — everything in the world is how it should be.' And it seems she felt the same way. The pair have since been spotted on 'a romantic date on Hamstead Heath days after the Olympics' with fans on twitter spotting the odd couple.

Mrs Brassell, who works in Asda, lost eight stone following her gastric bypass in November last year, going from a size 26 to a 14. Mr Brassell, who works at an aircraft paint factory, lost nine stone after having a gastric sleeve implant in January, where surgeons removed a portion of his stomach and re-attached it to form a sleeve shape, permanently reducing the size of his stomach by about 75 per cent. Mrs Brassell, a mother of one, had previously suffered sleep apnoea as a result of being overweight. She said: 'Now, I have so much energy and just really enjoy life. I believe having the surgery has prolonged my life.' The couple and daughter Rebecca, 26, used to live on takeaway food most nights but now eat healthy meals in small portions. They both began considering surgery after a holiday in the Dominican Republic last year. Mrs Brassell said: 'We got talking to another holidaymaker who had recently had weightloss surgery and was very pleased with the results and that set me off thinking. 'When we got home, I said to David that I’d been considering looking into having surgery and he actually said he’s been thinking the same thing.' Lifestyle change: Mrs Brassell, who works for Asda, used to eat takeaway meals every night with her family, but now has small healthy dishes . In September last year, the couple went to see their GP. Mrs Brassell was referred to the Bariatric surgery centre in Darlington and Mr Brassell was advised to try medication first. She added: 'I think the hardest thing was walking into the seminar for patients who are thinking about having surgery. 'There were a lot of people there who were even bigger than me. It made me think, ""I am not alone"". 'David came along to support me at the seminar but we both felt even more strongly after the meeting and after receiving all the information, surgery was the best option for both of us. 'You have to be really committed to change, I had to lose 5kg before the surgery and meet with a dietician to discuss the lifestyle changes you have to make after the operation. 'Since the operation I have lost 8st and I feel fantastic. I’ve gone from a size 26 to a 14. 'I used to eat sweets, takeaways, snacks and cakes, but now I have cereal in the morning and healthy meals. 'It is the best thing I have ever done, I feel like it’s a new lease of life and I’ve started doing exercise, going to the gym, swimming and circuits.' Mr Brassell said: 'It’s the simple things like being able to bend down to fasten your shoelaces and not having an aching back when you walk.' He admitted that when he and his wife were overweight, he even had to help his wife put her bra on, joking: 'I must have been the only husband who spent more time putting his wife’s bra on rather than taking it off.' The couple urged anyone who is struggling with obesity to talk to their GP about a possible referral for surgery on the NHS. The Darlington bariatric surgery centre has operated on 30 patients since it opened in September and many more are being prepared for surgery. Spending on NHS weightloss surgery in the North-East has soared in recent years and the region has the highest rate of of hospital admissions for patients with obesity problems at 40 per 100,000 people. In 2008-09, £1.7m was spent on weight-loss surgery in the region, but that more than doubled to £3.6m in 2009-10 and rose again to 4.6m in 2010-11. The Brassells' surgeon Akeil Samier said: 'It is very pleasing to hear the success stories of our patients and to see the difference the surgery has made to the quality of their lives. 'Debra and David know patients need to work hard to achieve the weightloss results that they want, but it does work and provides a long-term solution.' Before undergoing gastric surgery for weightloss, patients need to have a body mass index of more than 40, or more than 35 if they have other medical problems such as high blood pressure. Mr Samier added: 'These patients will have tried everything beforehand and will have failed with conservative methods. They must be committed to the follow up and to changing their lifestyle and eating habits after the operation, just as David and Debra were.'","Takeaway-addicted pair lost 17 stone between them and now eat healthily .

Jack, who grew up in Dorset, owns his own roofing contracting company and has a five-year-old son from a previous relationship. Her new romance hit the headlines after just a few weeks of dating when they exchanged saucy public messages on Twitter. Bride-to-be: Melanie is seen out and about in London today as she geared up to make the happy announcement . In one of the racy posts Melanie . tweeted that she had 'the giddiest knickers of my life' and told Jack: . 'I've got the raging horn, please take me'.

A five-year-old boy has taken his first steps - after a 'miracle' drug helped shrink a giant and deadly tumour that was raging through his body. Alfie Milne has a growth spanning his entire right leg, pelvic area, bowel, part of his stomach and lower spine. It is so big that surgeons are unable to remove it, and until recently he could only get about in a wheelchair. But after taking an experimental drug to . treat the incurable condition - which is through to affect just 500 . people worldwide - Alfie has been given a new lease of life and last . month he took his first steps. New start: Alfie Milne is now walking after an experimental drug stopped a tumour from growing in his body. He was diagnosed with a rare lymphatic disease at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 2010 (right) His mother Tracy, 39, from Aberdeen, said: 'It’s amazing. The difference was almost overnight. 'He went from being a child who spent most of his time on the sofa because he was in so much pain, to a very happy little boy who loves being in the thick of it. 'He wants to play football, wrestle, bounce on the trampoline, and climb trees. He sometimes forgets he’s not able to do all these things but he still wants to give it a go. Nothing stops him.' Alfie was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis, a rare and invasive disease caused by a malformation of the lymphatic system, when he was just 18 months old. It has also left him with brittle bones and his blood does not clot properly, which causes internal bleeding. But against all odds, Alfie’s condition has seen a marked improvement since he started taking trial drug Sirolimus. He no longer has to visit the hospital every week. The drug is more commonly used as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients, last September. Mrs Milne, who also has son Lewis, nine, said: 'As far as we are concerned it’ s a miracle drug. I can’t believe how happy and healthy Alfie is today. 'He is getting stronger every day. 'We’ve been able to wean him off all his pain relief, an MRI scan showed the tumour has reduced in size and it hasn’t spread. 'It was spreading really quickly and was going up into Alfie’s spine but it hasn’t gone any further. That in itself is fantastic. 'The ultimate goal is to find a cure but this is a breakthrough. It gives us hope.' Alfie's mother Tracy (pictured) said: 'This drug is giving Alfie the quality of life he should have' Alfie was just six months old, when Mrs Milne and her husband Mark, 43, noticed his leg appeared swollen when he was in his baby walker. He was eventually diagnosed a year later at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Alfie’s right leg remains swollen and is around three times larger than the left one. The disease is also making his right leg grow at a faster rate and it is 5cm longer. However Alfie, who until recently had to take morphine to combat the pain he was in, has a special shoe with a built-up sole to aid his balance. Mrs Milne said: 'We’ve got him pain free and balanced and he has been able to take his first steps unaided. 'It was very emotional. He just stood up and said: ‘Mummy, look at me’, and took three steps. 'He even made me keep it a secret from his dad because he wanted to practice before he showed him. My husband shed a few tears when he saw him walking.' Along with the trial drug, Alfie also takes potent cancer drugs once every seven weeks and steroids twice a day to help his blood clot. It is hoped his next session of chemotherapy next month will be his last and that in time he will also be able to come off the steroids. Alfie, at nine months old, before he was diagnosed. His parents were concerned that one of his legs appeared swollen . Mrs Milne now hopes Alfie, who was five last month, will be able to walk into school, when he starts there after the summer holidays. She said: 'It’s a major milestone. We didn’t really think he would get to mainstream school or even get to school. “I’m just so happy he is joining in and doing what he’s supposed to at five years of age. 'He’s a cheeky little character who is always laughing and playing with his brother and asking to have friends around. It’s fantastic he can just be a little boy.' However, they know there is no guarantee that the drug’s success will continue indefinitely. The family has now set up a charity in their son’s name to help raise money for Lymphangiopmatosis and Gorham’s Disease Alliance Europe. The organisation aims to fund research for a much-needed cure for the disease, which has a low life expectancy, with only some sufferers surviving 10 years or more. Mrs Milne said: 'This drug is giving Alfie the quality of life he should have and we’ve got to hold on to that. 'As long as his body can tolerate the toxins the drug produces he should be able to stay on it, hopefully, for the rest of his life. 'But they don’t know what side affects there could be. We just have to take it one day at a time. 'Something like this teaches you not to look too far into the future. We just have to live for today.' Since setting up Alfie’s Trust at the end of last year, they have raised more than £40,000.

Kristen, 22, has kept a lower profile . since compromising pictures of her and 41-year-old married director . Ruper Sanders emerged. She even missed a promotional event . for her latest film, a film adaptation of Jacques Kerouac's cult classic . On the Road, in London today, though it's been confirmed by People.com . she will attend the Toronto Film Festival between September 6 to 16th. In one new still, Kristen is depicted . with red vampiric eyes; as all fans know, her character Bella was . turned by Edward at the end of Breaking Dawn Part One after she nearly . died during childbirth. It's almost too much to bear: Robert gazes at Kristen adoringly... it's possible he'll never look at her the same way again .

But it’s not the children dreading the return to the classroom. A new survey revealed that a staggering 84 per cent of mums will be struck by the back-to-school blues this week. A survey reveals that 84 per cent of mothers will be struck by back to school blues this week . According to a nationwide study by Butlins the start of September will see 43 per cent feeling sad and lonely, 22 per cent sensing anxiety and one in five (20 per cent) feeling fed up and miserable. With just 12 per cent feeling some sense of relief when the children return to school. While a summer of fun family fixtures has impacted on the number of glum mothers across the UK, a quarter will also be fretting about their children making new friends and enjoying life back in class. And although three quarters of children will expect to feel some level of short-lived anxiety in returning to the school gate, nearly one in five mothers expect to take much longer to get over the start of term. The start of September will see 43 per cent of mothers feeling sad and lonely . And it’s not just mums feeling the strain of September according to the research; the back-to-school transition is also hard on family pets, with more than 51per cent of owners reporting a change in behaviour of their dogs and cats who have had playful company for six weeks. Butlins Director of Happiness, Mark Hunter, said: 'While many reports suggest that parents will be glad to see the back of  six-weeks of laying on entertainment, our research shows that the summer of 2012 has brought families even closer together, and coming to the end of it is leaving mums feeling really down. 'People can often feel a bit blue after good times, and it’s only when term time resumes that many parents come to the stark realisation that quality family time is really precious. 'Now is the time to look ahead and plan things together that they love doing – whether that’s a weekend trip to the park or a break away.' In a bid to cure the back-to-school blues, almost half of mums are already researching and booking a half term break to rekindle those special summer moments.

Risky?: It may be safe to use mobiles on planes, according to new research (posed by model) There may be no risk in using phones, Kindles or laptops on airplanes after 40 per cent of passengers admitted they don't turn them off during flights, a survey claims. The use of mobile phones and electronic devices during airplane takeoffs and landings have been banned by the Federal Aviation Administration since 1991 following complaints from pilots they were interfering with navigation equipment. Psychology professor at the University of Illinois Daniel Simons and psychology professor at Union College Christopher Chabris carried out a survey of 492 American adults who have flown in the past year to see how often passengers were breaching these regulations. Forty per cent admitted that they did not turn their phones off completely during takeoff and landing on their most recent flight. More than 7 per cent left their phones completely on, with the WiFi and cellular communications functions active, while a further 2 per cent actively used their phones when they weren't supposed to. According to the researchers, the odds that all 78 of the passengers who travel on an average-size U.S.domestic flight have properly turned off their phones are less than one in 100 quadrillion. They concluded: 'Our survey strongly suggests that there are multiple gadget violators on almost every flight. Rules: The Federal Aviation Administration's current policy prohibits the use of personal electronics during takeoffs and landing . 'If personal electronics are really as dangerous as the FAA rules suggest, navigation and communication would be disrupted every day on domestic flights. But we don't see that.' The pair argue that the FAA policy on electronic device use should be 'based on evidence rather than on fear'. In an article for the Wall Street Journal, they argue: 'There is no reason to doubt the anecdotes told by airline personnel about glitches that have occurred on flights when they also have discovered someone illicitly using a device. 'But when thinking about these anecdotes, we don't consider that glitches also occur in the absence of illicit gadget use. More important, we don't consider how often gadgets have been in use when flights have been completed without a hitch. 'Fear is a powerful motivator, and precaution is a natural response. Regulators are loath to make policies less restrictive, out of a justifiable concern for passenger safety. 'Once a restriction is in place, though, removing it becomes a challenge because every day without a gadget-induced accident cements our belief that the status quo is right and justified.'","Almost one in ten say they keep their mobiles connected to WiFi while in the air .

Tough times: Simon Cowell suffered a breakdown as he collapsed under pressure, earlier this summer . Simon Cowell collapsed from nervous exhaustion this summer after his workaholic lifestyle got the better of him, it emerged yesterday. The star was bedridden for weeks after doctors told him to rest, according to an updated biography. It claims the 52-year-old admitted he was ‘paralysed with tiredness’ and his ‘immune system was failing’ because of his job. But with The X Factor continuing to flop in the UK, and scheduling clashes dogging the US version, it seems there will be no respite in the near future. In an updated version of his book Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life Of Simon Cowell, biographer Tom Bower claims that the star had to halt filming of the US show as he began acting like a ‘weird vampire’, working through the night. Doctors warned him to give up smoking, stop taking health supplements and give his body a break. Cowell is claimed to have confided in X Factor judge Louis Walsh: ‘I desperately need peace. I’m craving normality. I’ve got to work out my demons and come out of it. ‘I have to get back to where I was  years ago. I have to stop reading texts at three in the morning and making calls later and later.’ He also told friends that running two high-profile shows in the UK and America had left him at breaking point. His enforced spell of rest meant he missed key promotional time with The X Factor’s new US line-up, which includes Britney Spears. But Cowell revealed he was told to take a rest because his life had ‘become like a night shift’, adding: ‘I had forgotten the sensation of the morning.’ His company Syco Productions officially stated that he had come down with bronchitis. It is understood he took a three-week break from work to recuperate fully. The revelations come as ratings in  Britain for Saturday night’s episode of  The X Factor dropped to a series low of 7.7million, with viewers apparently put off by the decision to show fewer performances and more ‘behind-the-scenes’ shots. Sleeping beauty: Simon was advised to get plenty of rest from his doctor after becoming a 'weird vampire' The ratings will be a blow to Cowell as they are some way below the average of more than 10million for the 2010 series. He will be hoping that the surprise reappearance of Cheryl Cole will provide a boost. The singer left her role as a judge for an ill-fated stint doing the same on the US version of the show, falling out with Cowell after she was axed within days. But she has returned to assist Gary Barlow as a guest mentor for the ‘judges’ houses’ stage of the singing competition, which will be screened later in the series. However, it seems that her feud with Cowell is not over. After he sent her a Twitter message to say ‘Welcome back’, the singer said: ‘I saw Simon’s tweet. I’m not doing this for him. I am doing this for Gary as he’s my friend and he asked me to do it.’ Meanwhile, the US version of The X Factor is facing increased competition. Last week Cowell reacted angrily to news that a rival talent show, the US version of The Voice, will be screened at the same time as The X Factor returns there for a second series. He said: ‘It is a spoiling tactic and it’s very simple – [The Voice broadcaster NBC doesn’t] want people to see this first episode… I think it’s mean-spirited and I hope and I pray that it backfires on them because this is one of the best shows we’ve ever made.’ Good friend: Simon confided in Louis Walsh throughout the dark period as the Irish judge filled in for Cowell on work commitments .","X Factor supremo was bedridden for weeks .

The union’s members are expected to hit the picket lines on Monday morning, while the school district and parents make plans for keeping students safe and occupied during the day. School board President David Vitale announced a short time earlier that talks had broken off despite the school board offering what he called a fair and responsible contract that would cover four years and cost the city $400 million. Lewis said she believed talks would resume Monday but a time had not been set for the sides to meet. She added that progress had been made but not enough to avert a strike. The city has a contingency plan should the strike go forward, with 144 public schools open to students from 8.30am to 12.30pm, WLS-TV reports. Failure: A man delivers armfuls of the signs on Saturday should they fail to reach an agreement over teachers' contracts with Chicago Public Schools, which they did on Sunday .

Regular school transportation is not . being made available with parents holding that responsibility, as well . as their registration on the district's website. The strike was announced after months . of tense, at-times heated talks between the city and the union . representing 25,500 public school teachers. The district, the third largest in the United States, had been offering a raise of 2 per cent a year for four years. The union called that offer unacceptable - particularly after Mayor Rahm Emanuel last year cancelled a previously negotiated 4 per cent pay raise, citing budget problems. The union countered by asking for a 30 per cent pay raise over two years, followed by a request for a 25 per cent increase over two years. Just weeks ago, Lewis told delegates the union had adjusted its demand and was asking for a 19 per cent pay raise in the contract's first year.

The union also has raised concerns about . raises based on teacher experience and education. It said the district . agreed to retain contract language allowing raises based on experience, . called step increases, but would not actually pay the money now. Teachers also have been concerned about new teacher evaluations, health benefits and regaining lost jobs. An additional issue was how a longer school day for students is being implemented. The threatened strike is the latest chapter in a very public and often contentious battle between the mayor and the union. When he took office last year, the former White House chief of staff inherited a school district facing a $700 million budget shortfall. Not long after, his administration rescinded 4 per cent raises for teachers. He then asked the union to re-open its contract and accept 2 per cent pay raises in exchange for lengthening the school day for students by 90 minutes. The union refused. Monumental: The strike will be the first one the city of Chicago has had in the last 25 years . Lack of: Two young children are seen eating pizza as their parents organize strike signage on Saturday, affected by a $700 million budget shortfall . The longer school day was one of the mayor's campaign promises for the city's schools, and he pushed to have it implemented a year ahead of schedule. He attempted to go around the union by asking teachers at individual schools to waive the contract and add 90 minutes to the day. He halted the effort after being challenged by the union before the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board. The district and union agreed in July on how to implement the longer school day, striking a deal to hire back 477 teachers who had been laid off rather than pay regular teachers more to work longer hours. That raised hopes the contract dispute would be settled soon, but bargaining continued on the other issues.","More than 26,000 teachers and support staff are expected to go on strike come Monday morning .

Public Health Wales said it was not yet clear whether the cases are linked but confirmed that there is an ‘ongoing outbreak’ among intravenous drug users in Europe and warned there may be more cases to come. Outbreak: Eight cases of anthrax have been identified amongst intravenous drug users in the past three months . The man, who is undergoing treatment at a hospital in the north east of England, is the eight case to be have been identified since early June, with contaminated heroin the suspected source. Last month it was reported that a drug user had died in a Lancashire hospital after being infected with anthrax. Dr Chris Whiteside, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: ‘It’s likely further cases among people who inject drugs will be identified as part of the on-going outbreak in EU countries. Bacillus anthracis: Anthrax under a microscope . ‘The Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of drug users presenting to emergency departments and walk-in clinics, with symptoms suggestive of anthrax.’ A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: ‘Anthrax in drug users was considered to be very rare. “Before the 2009-2010 outbreak in Scotland, only one previous case had been reported, in Norway in 2000.’ Dr Whiteside added that although anthrax was a very serious disease, it can be treated with antibiotics, especially if cases were identified early. Humans can become infected with anthrax through the skin, inhalation, injection or ingestion of anthrax spores and symptoms can vary depending on the route of infection. Drug users may become infected when heroin is contaminated with anthrax spores, however the drug is taken. The man at the centre of the latest outbreak is said to be responding to treatment well and is in a stable condition.","Latest case of drug addict contracting anthrax .

A disgraced bank director who the FBI believes faked his own suicide in order to escape the mounting charges against him left a lengthy, detailed confession note before he vanished. Investigators are looking at whether the letter written by Aubrey Lee Price, 46, is a genuine suicide note - or if he faked his death to go on the lam with more than $17 million swindled from investors. The Valdosta, Georgia resident disappeared shortly after announcing to family members that he planned to jump off a ferry out of Key West, Florida - where he was last seen in June. 'My depression and discouragement have driven me to deep anxiety, fear and shame,' the confession note reads. 'I am emotionally overwhelmed and incapable of continuing in this life.' Scroll down for video . Wanted: Former bank director Aubrey Lee Price has not been since June, after he told family members he was going to commit suicide. The FBI is investigating whether he faked his death . The married father went on: 'I created false statements, covered up my losses and deceived and hurt the very people I was trying to help.' The note, which is littered with grammatical errors and Bible verses, begins with an apology for its 'lack of structure, grammar and harmony of thought'. Price claims he was entirely responsible for the banking losses but that he was given bad advice and that banking was outside his area of expertise. He apologises to his clients, associates and partners but denies any money was stolen, saying it was all lost through bad investments. Raid: Officials believe that Price raised $40million from more than 100 investors in Georgia and Florida through an unregistered investment . fund that he managed . Web: Price allegedly forged bank documents to hide the millions of loses his investors suffered, so that they would continue giving him money . Price left his home on June 16 after telling family he was headed to Guatemala for business, said Sgt. Aaron Pritchett of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office. Two days later, his family received . letters saying he was going to Key West and planned to jump off a ferry . headed to Fort Meyers. Credit card records show he bought dive weights and a ferry ticket, which was scanned at the boarding point. He has not been seen since. Investigators are not ruling out the possibility he has fled to Venezuela, where he frequently travelled and said he owned property. They believe he could have a boat to travel from Florida to the country. The disappearance comes after Price became director of Montgomery Bank & Trust in December 2010 - and subsequent claims he swindled millions from investors in Georgia and Florida. Lies? Investigators remain unconvinced that the shamed money manager isn't somewhere on the lam with $17million in stolen funds from the Montgomery Bank and Trust, pictured . Rather than investing the money as he said he would, Price allegedly wired funds into accounts he controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank managers with fake documents. The FBI and federal prosecutors said Price embezzled $17 million in bank funds. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has now seized Montgomery Bank & Trust. Officials believe that Price raised . $40million from more than 100 investors since 2009. He forged bank documents to hide . the millions of loses his investors suffered, so that they would . continue giving him money. He routinely sent investors messages saying the firm, for which he made . the investment decisions, was consistently making positive returns, according to the SEC . lawsuit. Victim: Wendy Cross, pictured waiting for customers at her food truck in Atlanta, invested $300,000 in Price's bank. Cross said she will have to sell her truck because of her losses . Life's work: She said she is devastated and that the softly-spoken Price must have been an amazing actor . 'I . don't believe he's dead. I believe he planned for this exit,' Wendy Cross, an Atlantan who says she lost her $364,000 nest egg by . investing with Price, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The 46-year-old said she had met Price and described him as a very religious, soft-spoken man. 'He should have won an Oscar for his performance that day,' she said. 'He has left a path of financial carnage.' She discovered something was wrong last month when she wanted to withdraw some money from the firm to invest in another business. She tried multiple times to contact the firm to withdraw money. When she texted her financial adviser, he responded that he had had no idea what was going on at the company. Search: The FBI believes Price could be in Venezuela, where he has property and regularly visits . Cross said she has to sell her business as she needs the money to live and cannot afford a lawyer. Price had moved his family from Bradenton, Florida to the Valdosta, Georgia, where his wife's parents live, just a few weeks before he disappeared. There were financial reasons behind the move, but it also appears Price may have been trying to make things easier on his family once he disappeared, Pritchett said. Pritchett said he would not speculate on whether the man was alive: 'Until we have a body, it's kind of hard to say. It's almost like a novel.'

In legal papers filed on Monday, the university maintained that it was . Champion, not the school, who bears the ultimate responsibility for his death. Champion died last November after he was beaten by fellow members of the famed . Marching 100 band aboard a charter bus parked outside an Orlando hotel.

Blame game: Florida A&M University concluded that drum major Robert Champion was at fault for his hazing death last year . ‘No public university or college has a . legal duty to protect an adult student from the result of their own decision to . participate in a dangerous activity while off-campus and after retiring from . university-sponsored events,’ states the lengthy filing by Richard Mitchell, an . attorney with the GrayRobinson law firm hired by FAMU. Instead, the university maintains that . Champion — who it says witnessed others being hazed that night on the bus — . consented to the hazing ritual in order to gain respect among fellow band . members. Because of that, FAMU wants a judge to . throw out the lawsuit filed against the university by Champion's family or at . least delay action on it until criminal charges against Marching 100 band . members are resolved. The family also sued the owner and driver of the charter . bus where the ritual took place. ‘Under these circumstances, Florida's . taxpayers should not be held financially liable to Mr. Champion's estate for . the ultimate result of his own imprudent, avoidable and tragic decision and . death,’ states the motion filed by the university. However, Champion's parents and their attorney disagree. Life cut short: Champion, 26, passed away after he was beaten by fellow members of the famed Marching 100 band aboard a bus . ‘No, he was on the clock,’ attorney Chris Chestnut told ABC. ‘This is a . school sanctioned event. It's in a bus they chartered, at a hotel they . designated for him to stay at exclusively with members and staff of this institution.’ The legal filing represents the first . formal response that the university has made in the wake of Champion's death, . which led to arrests of band . members, the suspension of the famed band for this football . season and the resignation of the school's president. Twelve former members . have pleaded not guilty to charges of felony hazing. The suit was brought by Robert and . Pamela Champion of Decatur, Georgia. University trustees had discussed trying . to mediate the lawsuit, but FAMU's response may have doomed that effort. ‘It's startling that they would blame the victim for his own death,’ Chestnut . said. ‘FAMU is pointing the finger at everyone else but themselves, including . their own students.’ The lawyer added that the lawsuit needs to go forward so that the university . is held accountable for tolerating a culture of hazing that went unchecked for . years. Appalled: Champions' parents, Robert, left, and Pamela, right, as well as their attorney Chris Chestnut, center, said they are determined to pursue their lawsuit against FAMU . ‘Someone has got to hold FAMU . accountable,’ Chestnut said Monday. ‘We are now more committed than ever to . litigate this case to clear Robert's name and eradicate the culture of hazing . for the safety of future students.’ The university's motion also notes that Champion signed a Hazing and . Harassment Agreement prior to his death in which he acknowledged the ‘dangers . of participating in hazing, either as a hazer or a hazee.’ Chestnut, however, called the reference to the agreement a ‘tongue-in-cheek’ move on the part of FAMU. Ousted: Florida A&M University President James Ammons reached an agreement with school officials to immediately resign from his post . ‘Everyone signed that agreement, but they also knew that unless you were . hazed, you weren't accepted,’ he said. The Champions claim university . officials did not take action to stop hazing even though a school . dean proposed suspending the band because of hazing three days before their son . died. In its response the university denied that any specific proposal or . recommendation was made regarding suspending the band prior to Champion's . death. The Champion lawsuit also noted that . school officials allowed nonstudents to play in the band and asserts that . school officials fell short in enforcing anti-hazing policies and did not keep . a close eye on band members to prevent hazing. The university in the last several . months has instituted a long list of new policies, including limiting the . Marching 100 to just FAMU students and putting in new academic policies. Beginning in spring 2013, students will be required to sign an anti-hazing . pledge before they're allowed to register for classes. The State University System of Florida . still has a pending probe into whether university officials had ignored past . warnings about problems with hazing at FAMU.

But a first-of-its-kind oral antiseptic spray promises to end the annual misery endured by millions of flu sufferers, and thousands of lives, around the world. Or so its manufacturer claims. The Halo Oral Antiseptic has been found to be 99.9 per cent effective in killing infectious airborne germs. Breakthrough? An oral antiseptic spray promises to end the annual misery endured by millions of flu sufferers, and thousands of lives, around the world . Lead author Dr Frank Esper, from the . University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, said: . 'Respiratory tract disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality . throughout the world. Yet there has been limited progress in the . prevention of respiratory virus infections. 'Halo is unique in that it offers protection from airborne germs such as influenza and rhinovirus.' The . scientists used glycerine and xanthan gum as a microbial barrier . combined with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) as a broad-spectrum . anti-infective agent to fight respiratory illnesses. To . test this, clinical strains of 2009 pandemic H1N1 were used as a . prototype virus to demonstrate Halo's anti-infective activity in cell . culture assays. Dr . Esper said: 'The glycerine and xanthan gum prevent the germs from . entering a person's system and the CPC kills the germs once they're . trapped there.' He said . Halo will have clear benefit to aid against infection and reduce . disease from epidemic, sporadic or pandemic respiratory viral . infections, particularly helping people at risk for severe respiratory . illness including immune-compromised individuals with chronic lung . disease, and military personnel. The study findings were presented . yesterday at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and . Chemotherapy in San Francisco. Easy-to-use: The Halo Oral Antiseptic has been found to be 99.9 per cent effective in killing infectious airborne germs . Regular application: The spray needs to be used three times each day to prove effective . Another study on Halo will be presented by Dr Mahmoud Ghannoum of UH Case Medical Center, also in Cleveland, showing Halo's effectiveness against disease-causing pathogenic germs. That study asserts that respiratory and/or systemic infections through airborne and manually transmitted pathogenic microbes often enter the system through the mouth, making Halo, an oral spray that targets these pathogens, an effective way to prevent infections. Additionally, preliminary data from the researchers found that Halo completely kills all 11 clinical strains of whooping cough against which the spray was tested. The results showed that when a person used three sprays of Halo, it destroyed airborne germs breathed in for up to six hours, even when people were eating and drinking. The concept of coating the back of the oral cavity to prevent germs from entering and then providing sustained antiseptic action to kill airborne germs was developed by a Cleveland company, Oasis Consumer Healthcare. Dr Ghannoum said: 'Exposure to airborne germs is inevitable - especially in crowded environments and when travelling. Unlike other products that support the immune system or protect from germs on surfaces or hands, Halo is the first and only product of its kind to offer protection from airborne germs.' The Halo Oral Antiseptic is on sale in the U.S. now.","Halo Oral Antiseptic has been found to be 99.9 per cent effective in killing infectious airborne germs .

Norfolk Southern said it appeared about 11 cars of a southbound train with 98 cars derailed around 2 a.m. near Interstate 71, southeast of the Ohio State University campus in Columbus. They went off the tracks north of downtown, in an industrial area blocks from residential neighbourhoods. Ablaze: People watch the flames shoot up from a freight train that derailed and some cars burst into flames in Columbus . Burning: Flames rise from a derailed freight train; part of the cargo train derailed and caught fire in Ohio's capital city early Wednesday, shooting flames skyward into the darkness . Witnessing: People watch the flames shoot up; people living in one-mile radius of the blast have been evacuated . Joel Priester said he watched the blast from his home two blocks away. 'I saw flames, then I heard a loud sound, like a boom, and saw the flames shooting higher,' he said. 'It looked like the sun exploded.' Three of the burning cars were tankers carrying ethanol, said Assistant Chief David Whiting of the Columbus fire division. After viewing the scene in daylight, authorities decided to let the fire burn out instead of trying to extinguish it. It wasn't immediately clear what caused the derailment, which blocked access to about half of the Central Ohio Transit Authority's fleet of vehicles, limiting the city's public bus service. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending an investigator to the scene.

He said he couldn't comment on the crew's safety record but said the company has been recognized in the industry for its overall safety record. Photographer Chris Mumma said he was more than 10 miles away in New Albany when he saw the night sky brightened by a 'huge illumination' that he later learned was an explosion. He said he went to the scene to take photos and saw punctures on top of the train that were spewing flames 20 to 30 feet high. He also noticed an odd odor. 'I noticed there was a chemical smell, and I was inhaling it so I backed up a little bit more because I wasn't sure what I was getting involved with,' he said.

Zimmerman, a 28-year-old who is white and Hispanic, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of the 17-year-old Martin. Martin was unarmed and walking back from a store when Zimmerman called a 911 dispatcher and said the teen looked suspicious. Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self defense after he was attacked and Martin repeatedly slammed his head to the ground. Martin's killing drew national attention after police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman, citing Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' self-defense law and the shooter's assertion that he used deadly force because he feared his life was in danger. Forced out: The decision from the three-judge panel came in response to a motion filed by Zimmerman's lawyer asking the court to overturn a ruling by Judge Kenneth Lester refusing to step down from the case . In a motion filed last month seeking a new judge, Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, claimed Lester made 'gratuitous' and 'disparaging remarks' about Zimmerman and showed bias in a July 5 bond ruling raising his bond from $150,000 to $1 million. The increase came after prosecutors presented evidence that Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, misled the judge about their finances. Shellie Zimmerman was later charged with perjury. Lester issued a scathing decision at the time, writing that Zimmerman 'tried to manipulate the system.' Shot dead: Florida teen Trayvon Martin was fatally shot by Zimmerman in February . He said Zimmerman's explanations for not disclosing around $135,000 from anonymous donors raised for his defense 'changed with each retelling.' Zimmerman is out on bond and living in an undisclosed safe house in Seminole County in central Florida awaiting trial.","Florida appeals court ruled 2-1 for Zimmerman to be granted new judge .

It could have ruined their relationship but after Bobby Noris confessed to Lydia Bright how he felt about Charlie, he decided last night to come clean and tell the man himself. Watching his best friend dance with various women at his birthday party became all too much for the Charlie and he decided to come clean. After storming out of Essex club Funky Mojoes, Bobby sat on a step as Charlie asked him what was wrong. 'I love you': Bobby Noris tells Charlie how he really feels about him at his birthday party . Reassuring him: Charlie told the camp salon owner that their friendship would never change . 'Not really babe,' he replied. 'I think I haven't been entirely honest about things over the last few days. 'The time has kind of come. If I could flick a switch and not feel this I so would,' he went on to add. 'I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think I've kind of fallen quite hard for you and I do love you Charlie.' Charlie - who used to date Gemma Collins - genuinely looked a little bit surprised following his confession, but reassured him that nothing would change between them. Flick of a switch: Bobby said that if he could turn his feelings off he would . 'It's a bit of a surprise if I'm honest,' he said. 'Nothing will jeopardise our friendship but I'm on a journey now and this is all about me growing. You've gotta let me do that because its what I want to do.' 'I didn't ever plan or expect to tell you this and if you have to break away for a little bit, I understand,' Bobby went on to say. 'I'm sorry if I've brought shame and embarrassment on you. I feel like I've betrayed you.'

Harvard University basketball co-captain Kyle Casey plans to withdraw from school and is likely to miss an entire season amid a cheating scandal that also may involve other athletes, according to several reports. Sports Illustrated and the Harvard Crimson reported Tuesday that Casey, a senior credited with helping his team advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 65 years, would take a leave of absence from school in an attempt to preserve a year of eligibility once the issue is resolved. Co-captain Brandyn Curry also has been implicated in the scandal and is weighing his options, his father told the magazine. The Boston Herald reported Curry also is expected to withdraw from classes. Standout: Harvard co-captain Kyle Casey plans to withdraw from school for two semesters after becoming implicated in a recent cheating scandal . A source indicated that another unnamed basketball player with a smaller role on the team could be involved as well, the Boston Herald. The school is looking into whether at least 125 undergraduates in Government 1310: Introduction to Congress, a spring 2012 class with an enrollment of 279 cheated by collaborating on answers for a take-home final exam. Up in the air: Crimson co-captain Brandyn Curry is weighing his options after having been implicated in the scandal . The students implicated in the scandals are facing charges of academic dishonesty that could carry a one-year suspension from school. School officials have declined to release the students' names. ‘These allegations, if proven, represent totally unacceptable behavior that betrays the trust upon which intellectual inquiry at Harvard depends,’ President Drew Faust said when the cheating scandal was uncovered in August. Each student whose work is in question has been called to appear before a subcommittee of the Harvard College Administrative Board, which reviews issues of academic integrity. Possible punishments range from an admonition, a sort of warning for a first offense, to being forced to withdraw from Harvard for a year. According to Sports Illustrated sources, Casey had the option of enrolling for the fall 2012 semester and fighting the cheating allegations, but risked losing his final season of Ivy League eligibility if the administrative board ruled against him. By withdrawing for the season, the standout forward may be readmitted to Harvard in 2013-14. Harris emphasized that none of the allegations has been proven and said there's no evidence of widespread cheating at Harvard. The Crimson reported that other athletes, including football players are also among those implicated, which may result in changes to the team’s line-up. Trouble brewing: Members of Harvard's football team also may have been involved in the answer-sharing case, which could result in changes to the line-up .

Hartford spokesman Tim Williamson . declined to comment on Tuesday. Messages seeking comment also were left . for Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker, football coach Tim Murphy, . Curry and Casey. Successful season: Casey and Currey helped the Crimson advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946 last year . Harvard is coming off Ivy League . championships in both football and basketball, where the Crimson made . their first trip to the NCAA tournament since 1946 last season, going . 26-4 under Amaker. The six-foot-seven Casey averaged more than 11 points per game, a team high and more than five rebounds. Curry averaged almost eight points a game. Amaker, a former Duke star, came to Harvard in 2007 from Michigan, where he was charged with cleaning up that program after years of scandal. The Crimson, citing an email it obtained from John Ellison, the Secretary of the Administrative Board, said athletes involved were being asked to weigh potential Ivy League eligibility issues when deciding whether or not to remain on campus for the fall term. Typically, if a player takes part in athletic competition before being asked to take a leave of absence by the board, the player loses a full season of Ivy League eligibility, the newspaper reported. ‘Fall-term athletes may also want to consider taking (a leave) before their first game,’ Ellison wrote in the email, according to the Crimson. Harvard, which was poised to repeat its success from last year, is likely to have a tough time replacing Casey, who was the team’s only established interior player, as well as Curry, who is the sole experienced player on the roster.","Co-captain Kyle Casey plans to withdraw for the season to remain eligible for readmission in 2013-2014 .

A stuttering Asda worker who claims he was sacked over his speech impediment launched a campaign of harassment against a colleague an employment tribunal heard today. Adnan Malik accused the supermarket giant of discriminating against his disability after it sacked him for talking 'aggressively' and gesticulating in front of customers. The 30-year-old claims the unusual behavior was simply the product of frustration at his inability to get the words out but today his employers hit back. Other side: Stuttering Asda worker Adnan Malik was accused of a string of escalating instances of bullying and harassment against his cousin Amna Sarwar, who was also his colleague . Mr Malik was accused of a string of escalating instances of bullying and harassment against his cousin Amna Sarwar, who was also his colleague, culminating in a complaint made to the police. All three confrontations between the pair took place inside the store, in Reading, Berkshire, and after the second he was advised to stay away from his relative by the police. The tribunal heard how Ms Sarwar, who was based on the shop floor and check-out, worked a different shift pattern to the store assistant, meaning their paths need not have crossed. Manager Stephen Chamberlain, who dismissed Mr Malik, told the tribunal his employee might have escaped the axe had he not gone back a third time. He said: 'He was dismissed because of this act of intimidation and bullying.He continued going back when he shouldn’t have done. 'Irrespective of the shouting and the gesticulating issue it would have been dismissal anyway.' Scene: All three confrontations between Mr Malik and Ms Sarwar took place inside the store, in Reading, Berkshire . He added: 'Amna was used to his language and body language. For her to feel so upset that she had to go to the police, we inferred that it was a serious conflict.' A family feud spilled over into the pair’s working lives when the married father-of-two walked into the branch in July, last year, while he was meant to be on holiday. After an initial confrontation he left the store only to return later in an agitated state and he approached Ms Sarwar talking loudly and aggressively, the tribunal heard. However, the dispute reached its peak when he appeared inside the branch a third time several days later when she claims he threatened to 'chop her up'. Another witness, who mistook him for a customer, stated he had been aggressive and threatening. Mr Malik denies harassing Ms Sarwar and says his loud voice was simply an attempt to express himself as he struggled against his stutter. Out of work: Since his dismissal from Asda, Mr Malik has been out of work and claiming Job Seeker's allowance . He said: 'He dismissed me because I raised my voice, that is not under my control. 'When I talk with someone, in order to continue the conversation, I have to raise my voice because that helps me. 'I spent seven-and-a-half years with this company. People know me, all my colleagues understand I have to raise my voice. 'Customers don’t know me. The customers think I’m shouting. I’m raising my voice but I’m talking normally.' Mr Malik appealed the sacking decision and produced a letter from his GP confirming he suffered from the long term problem and had attempted speech therapy to no avail. The tribunal panel was told that the father-of-two’s stutter got worse the more stressed he got and he sometimes gesticulated and moved his body as he struggled to speak. When he approached his cousin, who was working at a check-out till at the same branch, he said he was afflicted with the stutter and could not squeeze out the words he wanted to say. The store assistant began to gesticulate and his actions scared a nearby customer who, oblivious to his disability, told managers he was shouting and being aggressive, the tribunal heard. The store assistant claims that owing to a family feud his cousin turned on him, claiming he had threatened to 'chop her up' - a claim completely absent from the customer’s complaint. Since his dismissal Mr Malik has been out of work and claiming Job Seeker’s allowance. The hearing continues.","Adnan Malik accused supermarket giant of discriminating against his disability .

Controversial new rules on flying hours imposed by the EU could see pilots dozing off in the cockpit during flights, pilots’ groups have warned. Ministers yesterday backed controversial new EU flying hours rules to be imposed on Britain. New Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was accused of ‘rolling over to Brussels’ after his department approved the rules despite the concerns raised in a report by the respected Commons’ Transport Select committee. Jet lag: Controversial new rules on flying hours imposed by the EU could see pilots dozing off in the cockpit during flights, pilots' groups have warned . Under the new rules, pilots could be landing commercial jets after 22 hours awake- including 11 hours flying, plus stand-by time and travel to the airport. MPs had warned in their original report that 22 hours of wakefulness was ‘an extraordinary figure’ - particularly for night flying - that raised levels of fatigue equivalent to being ‘drunk.’ Currently UK pilots are limited to 18 hours without sleep - but more than 4 out of ten pilots (43 per cent) already report nodding off in-flight- of whom a third (31 per cent) awoke to find their co-pilot also asleep, MPs heard in evidence. Despite this, the Department for . Transport yesterday insisted the EU blueprint would neither compromise . safety nor increase the risk of pilot fatigue. New Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was accused of ¿rolling over to Brussels¿ after his department approved the rules . In its official response to the MP’s report published yesterday the Department of Transport defended its backing of the EU flying hours plan and insisted: ‘The Government believes that the current draft of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) proposals will not lead to a diminution of safety in the UK. ‘The proposals are more conservative than current EU rules which were introduced in 2008 and will result in a significant improvement in safety across the EU as a whole.’ But the British Airline Pilots’ Association (BALPA) has written to Mr McLoughlin urging him to ‘think again’. A BALPA spokesman said: ‘It is clear that the Government has chosen to ignore the concerns of thousands of pilots in the UK. It looks like the Government are going to roll over to Brussels on this. ‘Europe want British pilots flying more tired more often. So the Government response is extremely disappointing. We hope the new Transport Secretary will change course.’ The row centres around new rules laid out by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) which was mandated four years ago by Brussels to ‘harmonise’ flight time limits and shift-patterns across the EU. Since the row erupted, Brussels has signalled it may compromise on 20 hours. And despite accepting the new rules the Government did accept some of the MP’s findings - including a recommendation to investigate ‘ the potential under-reporting of pilot fatigue’. Ministers said they would also be seeking a strengthening of specific EU ‘fatigue’ rules surrounding flight duties and rest periods and ‘stricter limits’ on how frequently airlines could use discretion to exceed maximum levels. Transport committee chairman Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said of the Government’s response: ‘There are still areas of concern. The jury’s out. The proof will be in their actions.’ A Department for transport spokesman said: ‘The safety of the travelling public is paramount and we have been quite clear that we would not support any proposals which the UK’s safety regulator - the Civil Aviation Authority- advise do not provide sufficient protection against crew fatigue. ‘We are still awaiting EASA’s final proposals, but the CAA is satisfied that the latest draft rules now provide a level of safety broadly equivalent to those already in place in the UK.’","Under the new rules, pilots could be landing commercial jets after 22 hours awake .

A toddler cheated death in a medical miracle thanks to a combination of two killers conditions, it has emerged. While one defect threatened the life of Conner Breslin, another dangerous condition neutralised the effects of the first. Both rare heart conditions are extremely dangerous, but - in a million-to-one chance - because he had both, it saved his life. On the mend: Conner Breslin with his mother Claire McCormack. But the youngster almost died when he developed two dangerous heart conditions . Conner pictured immediately after his heart surgery at the age of six months. The youngster was only saved after he developed two holes in his heart . Reversed arteries in the little boy's heart were flooding his lungs with blood and depriving the rest of his body of oxygen, meaning he was in danger of drowning. However, Conner had developed two holes in his heart, which allowed just enough oxygenated blood to escape for him to survive. The 15-month-old, who has ‘complex transposition of the great vessels (TGV)’, has now beaten the odds and is back at home. The youngster even took his first steps last month - a day his parents never thought they would see. His proud mother, 26-year-old Claire McCormack said: 'Normally holes in your heart would be a terrible diagnosis, but it’s amazing to think that it’s that very thing that saved him. 'If the holes had not been there the other defect would have killed him. 'I have been told the odds of him having both the conditions are very slim and a good job he did. 'He’s a little miracle. To look at him now you would have no idea. He’s bounced back incredibly well.' Reversed arteries in the little boy's heart were flooding his lungs with blood and depriving the rest of his body of oxygen, meaning he was in danger of drowning . Fighter: Conner underwent a gruelling eight-hour operation to widen the holes in his heart to allow more blood through . Conner was born a normal happy baby with no complications in June last year. Claire and his dad Shaun Breslin, 26, took him home to North Lanarkshire, Scotland, but when he was five weeks old the he stopped eating. He was admitted to Glasgow’s Yorkhill Royal Hospital for Sick Children with a suspected viral infection, but was rushed into intensive care just two hours later, after being diagnosed with TGV. The young boy was suffering from reversed arteries, which instead of pumping blood from his heart into his body, were directing it into his lungs, causing them to fill with blood. In July last year, Conner underwent a gruelling eight-hour operation to widen the holes and allow more blood through. Since then, the little lad has had open-heart surgery twice more, including a 12-hour procedure in February, where surgeons switched his reversed arteries and closed the holes in his tiny heart. Claire added: 'The idea of the first operation to widen the holes was to allow as much oxygenated blood to get into his body through the holes as possible, so he was as strong as he could be for his big operation to fix the defects. Relieved: Conner's parents Claire and Shaun Breslin say their boy has made a miraculous recovery and even took his first steps last month . 'I was a nervous wreck throughout all his surgery. It doesn’t matter how strong you think you are, watching your child be put to sleep for an operation is the worst experience in the world. I remember just breaking down and crying. 'During the big operation he went into surgery at 8.30am and didn’t come out until 9pm. 'After the operation he was so swollen I didn’t even recognise him. The only thing that identified him as my child was the birth mark on his calf. There were so many tubes it was like spaghetti junction. 'He’s such a fighter. The doctors said they gave him enough medicine to sedate a donkey for three days but after just one he started kicking. They just couldn’t get him to sleep. 'He became quite well known on the ward for his night time noise. From that the nurses said they knew he was going to be fine.' Conner was expected to stay in hospital for over two months to recover, but just a week and a half later he was ready to leave, to the amazement of nurses on the ward. He has since made a miraculous recovery and took his first steps last month. Claire said: 'We are not religious at all but I believe he is a miracle. To go from being told he may not make it through the night to taking his first steps is amazing. 'He might be a little smaller than other children as he’s growing up but other than that he’s completely normal. 'And by the way he screams there is definitely nothing wrong with his lungs.'","Reversed arteries in Conner Breslin's heart were flooding his lungs with blood and depriving him of oxygen .

The suspected boyfriend of a bank manager who reported being held hostage by two mystery men before forced to rob her own bank has been arrested and charged with robbery and conspiracy. Ray Vega, 33, has been released on $100,000 bail after arrested a day after the September 5th heist in Los Angeles, California that emptied the Bank of America safe with the manager's help. The bank manager, identified as 32-year-old mother Aurora Barrera, maintains her claims of having not known her abductors who she described as two black men in masks. Scroll down for video . An act: A bomb squad member signals the explosive device strapped to a Bank of America branch manager as safe with it having not been an explosive at all . According to KTLA, there are unconfirmed reports about Ms Barrera's romantic link to Vega. Ms Barrera told police last week she was abducted from her home around 8.30am in Huntington Park and strapped with a sinister-looking device the men claimed was an explosive. Vega, a former U.S. marine according to KTLA, is being charged at the state rather than federal level. Armed with guns and wearing ski masks, the robbers raided the South Atlantic Boulevard branch with the woman. The men, who police at the time suspected knew the manager, then forced the woman to order her fellow employees to remove the cash from the bank before throwing it to the heisters waiting outside the building. 'She was told that it was explosives . and she was ordered to go into the bank and take out all the money,' said sheriff's Captain Mike Parker.

Kidnapped: The woman, pictured, remained at the bank after the robbers got away and a bomb squad removed the device from her body . Robot: The device was blown up by a robot, pictured, but investigators later said it wasn't an explosive . Manager: Aurora Barrera, the bank's manager, is seen after the robbery but just before reports got out that she was romantically involved with one of the robbers . Parker said the manager entered the safe and the men got away with 'a decent amount' of money. 'She did do that in fear for her life,' he added. The bank robbers took off in a two-door white Kia with partial license plates 6HOR54. Vega's arrest last week was the first in the investigation, according to police. The woman remained inside the bank until the Los Angeles County sheriff's bomb squad arrived and carefully removed the device from her body. The bomb squad used a robot to blow up . the so-called explosive, which police said appeared to be a 'pipe bomb' but investigators later determined was a dummy explosive.

"Kirsty Heslewood, 23, from Hertfordshire suffered from selective mutism . Known in her school as 'the girl who wouldn't speak', Kirsty didn't utter a word outside of her home . Her silence was finally broken when her mother sent a video of her talking to be shown in her school assembly. 'I felt my secret was out,' she says . By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 05:04 EST, 18 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:53 EST, 18 May 2012 . A woman who suffered from selective mutism has overcome her shyness to become a contender for the Miss England crown. Kirsty Heslewood, 23, was once so shy she wouldn't speak to anyone outside her home and was known at her school in Hertfordshire as 'the girl who wouldn't speak'. It wasn't until the age of seven that she began speaking at school and she gradually became more outspoken as she grew up. But it wasn't until she got into modelling as a teenager that she really found her confidence and she's now a contender for the Miss England crown after being named Miss Hertfordshire. Blossomed: Kirsty has overcome her shyness to become a contender for the Miss England crown . Kirsty, from Bishops Stortford, said: 'Looking back I can’t believe the little girl who suffered from mutism was even me. 'My confidence has grown so much since those days, particularly over the past few years and nowadays I am certainly no wall flower. 'I guess it just shows that if you are determined, nurtured and encouraged, you can overcome anything.' Kirsty would speak at home with her family as a child but when she started nursery at the age of four, she became crippled by an inability to speak. Silence in class: Kirsty didn't speak at school from her first day at nursery until the age of seven . She recalls: 'It started the day I went to nursery school, I remember holding onto my Mum's legs whilst she tried to untie me. I wasn't crying, just holding on tight. I didn't want her to leave me and was shocked that I had to stay. I remember just wanting to cry and go home with my little brother. The nursery teachers were trying their best to cheer me up or make me talk to them or the other children. 'I was so shy and scared that I couldn't bring myself to speak even though I wanted to. Every morning when I was at the nursery, I didn't speak once.' Kirsty's silence continued when she started primary school where she wouldn't speak to her friends or even answer the register. She only responded to questions by making signs like nodding her head. While the other children were intrigued by her inability to talk and nicknamed her 'the girl who wouldn't speak', Kirsty's teachers tried various attempts to get her to find her voice, initially without success. 'All the teachers knew that I didn't speak; some would try to get a sentence out of me, others would just accept it. I remember one teacher shouting at me saying, ""you must answer the register in case there is a fire"", which just made me cry. 'The school didn't understand what was wrong. They didn't know if it was just a bad case of someone suffering from anxiety or shyness or if I just couldn't talk. Selective mutism wasn't known then.' Selective mutism is a childhood anxiety disorder where a child cannot speak in most social situations despite being able to. It usually begins in children under the age of five but often only becomes noticeable when they start school. An estimated one in 150 children suffer from selective mutism in Britain. The causes of the problem are varied but can be prompted by a specific phobia, an inherited predisposition to anxiety, or if a child has problems processing sensory information. It can also occur in children who have suffered abuse or trauma. Come a long way: Today, the beauty queen can't believe she was the little girl who suffered with selective mutism . For Kirsty, the problem developed from her anxiety at starting nursery, but then her silence at school became a habit she couldn't break, even though she wanted to. 'I actually really wanted to be able to talk and play like everyone else, but I felt like it had gone to far to break the silence,' she said. 'Finding that courage to say just one word was the hardest thing and I just couldn't do it.' Teachers tried visiting Kirsty at her home, where she was a chatty child among her siblings and cousins, but she would freeze up when they were present. Childhood disorder: An estimated one in 150 children suffer from selective mutism in Britain like Kirsty did . Kirsty's mother Kerry said it was an anxious time for her to as she couldn't fathom why her confident daughter disappeared outside their home. 'Kirsty was a very lively and outward going girl at home but when she got in public she just withdrew completely and became the shadow of herself,' she said. 'Looking at her now it is hard to believe she was so shy but at the time it was very worrying as the disorder was not recognised or identified.' Some people doubted whether Kirsty could speak at all so Kerry decided to prove her daughter had a voice by sending the school a video of Kirsty playing at home, where she was talking freely and making voices for a puppet show. Kirsty was stunned when the video was shown to her teachers and classmates in an assembly -  but it gave her the release she needed to break her silence. She explains: 'I was in a line, ready to walk into a class assembly, the TV was in there, all the teachers, headmaster, deputy head, helpers, cleaners, dinner ladies and anyone else who needed to see this piece of evidence. 'I had no idea what I was about to watch, I thought it would just be a casual afternoon watching a film. 'Then they turned the TV on and up I popped playing with Sooty and Sweep talking properly and making voices for my puppets. 'I was so surprised ""why am I on the TV?"" I thought to myself, then I saw everyone else's reactions. The children were shouting ""Kirsty can speak"" whilst the teachers just smiled. 'My friends were so surprised and shocked to hear me speak, they started asking questions and talking to me, and eventually I started answering back. Once everyone knew my secret I felt I was allowed to talk.' On the catwalk: Kirsty, left, recently joined Amy Childs to help model the TOWIE star's fashion range . Progress was slow, but Kirsty gradually began to talk more and more at school. She continued to be shy when she was at secondary school but gained in confidence when she took her A Levels and when her good looks were noticed by modelling agents. She said: 'I started gaining confidence when studying for my A Levels as I had to read out aloud in class, do presentations and be confident enough to ask questions. Gaining good grades took priority and in the end I felt being shy wouldn't allow me to do as well. 'I also started getting modelling agencies approach me and doing some modelling work, which also helped my confidence.' Since taking up modelling, Kirsty has worked with The Only Way is Essex's Amy Childs, modelling her fashion range, and as well as having success in beauty pageants. Found her voice: Studying for A Levels and becoming a model helped Kirsty grow in confidence . In March, she impressed the judges to be crowned Miss Hertfordshire, giving her a place in the Miss England final later this year. Kirsty said is delighted to be taking part in the competition and her success is testament to how far she has come since being that little girl at school who wouldn't speak a word. 'I can't wait for the Miss England grand final', she said. 'Obviously I would love to win but even if I don’t, the whole experience has been amazing. Not only have I made some great friends, but I have increased my confidence, self-esteem and ability to speak.'","Kirsty Heslewood, 23, from Hertfordshire suffered from selective mutism .

"By . Allan Hall . PUBLISHED: . 06:11 EST, 13 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:06 EST, 13 September 2012 . A German schoolboy's life has been saved by his parents who each gave up one of their lungs as he grew closer to death. Marius Schneider, 12, is now on the mend after undergoing the historic op - the first of its kind undertaken in Europe - by specialists in Hanover. Marius is a cystic fibrosis sufferer; victims often suffer chronic lung and respiratory problems. The only hope for him were donor lungs as he struggled for breath each day. On the mend: Cystic Fibrosis sufferer Marius Schneider, pictured with his family, is now on the mend after undergoing the historic double lung transplant in Hanover . Success: Marius Schneider answers questions during a press conference alongside his mother, sister and Professor Axel Haverich, Germany's most famous transplant surgeon . Cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic condition making the body produce mucus thicker than normal which gradually fills the lungs, reducing and eventually stopping the ability to breathe normally.The condition, normally detected at birth or early childhood, carries the symptoms of salty tasting skin, poor growth and weight gain despite a normal diet, accumulation of thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections and coughing or shortness of breath.Cystic Fibrosis can be managed, but if the lungs decline to such an extent that a patient's life is threatened doctors may decide to perform a transplant. Finding a donor is tricky because people with CF must have both lungs replaced to prevent the remaining lung infecting the new lung with bacteria. 'We were desperately waiting for an organ, waiting for a call every day,' his father Lars said.  By the time of the operation in April he was surviving with the aid of a ventilator and a heart-lung machine. He was flown to the hospital in Hanover on Friday April 13 from his home in southern Germany and had the operation 13 days later. 'For him, 13 seems to be a bit of a lucky number,' added Mr Schneider. 'The transplant was his last chance,' said Dr Gregor Warnecke, the doctor in charge of his care. 'The hospital would not have operated on his parents if it had not been an absolute necessity.' Professor Dr Axel Haverich, Germany's most famous transplant surgeon, said: 'Marius was already somewhere between heaven and earth when we operated. He was living in a state of almost perpetual anaesthesia.  But he is a real fighter. We had a team of 40 and he came through.' Marius was lucky on two counts: both of his parents had compatible blood groups, and their lungs were bigger than his, which is necessary for a successful transplant. 'If we had enough organ donors in Germany, the doctors would not have to resort to living donors,' Mr Schneider said. 'We are happy and thankful that we and the doctors were able to help Marius.' He and Marius’ mother Anja had no doubts about each donating a lung to save their boy. 'It was immediately clear what we had to do in order to save our son,' she said. This or nothing: Dr Gregor Warnecke demonstrates how the operation will work. He had said the transplant was Marius' last chance . Crack team: Surgeons at the Hannover Medical University performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into Marius. The procedure took close to six hours . Surgeons at the Hannover Medical University (MHH) performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed  from each parent and then implanted into Marius. The procedure took close to six hours. 'The operations went well, the parents were able to leave hospital after ten days,' added Dr Warnecke. 'The transplantation worked well with Marius. We were able to remove the tubes from him two days after the operation.' Marius was released from hospital after 155 days. And although his quality of life has improved enormously – he can play football and ride his bike – his immune system remains weak and he is being tutored at home. Marius, whose sister Nele shares his love for Schalke football club, said: 'I am especially proud of my parents. They gave me their lungs so I could live. Now I can keep up with them on bike rides.' While this was the first procedure of its kind in Europe, doctors say it will probably remain an exception because of the need for two donors at a time with the requisite blood groups.",Marius Schneider suffers from cystic fibrosis .

Graphic, disturbing and 'beyond pornographic' images are believed to have been found on Gary Giordano's camera of missing Maryland woman Robyn Gardner, calling into question the relationship between them, who were at first believed to simply be travelling companions. Giordano's camera, as well as his laptop and cell phone, have been sent away for analysis. Solicitor general of Aruba Taco Stein - who called the 50-year-old a 'mean b******' - could not confirm the nature of the images to the Today Show but would only say it did not look like she was under any duress. Missing: 'Beyond pornographic' images of Robyn Gardner were said to be found on Giordano's camera . Meanwhile it emerged that the Maryland businessman tried to collect the $1.5million accidental death policy he took out on her just two days after he reported her disappearance to police. Giordano, who purchased the accidental policy shortly before travelling to the Dutch Caribbean island with the 35-year-old, tried to begin redeeming the American Express policy, which he took out just days before their trip and unusually only covered the trip to Aruba. According to a police source, Giordano . purchased a more expensive one-year policy instead of a more commonly . purchased five year policy. Insurance: Gary Giordano tried to redeem accidental death policy on missing woman Robyn Gardner, which named him as a beneficiary, days before their trip to the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba . Authorities today were preparing a massive search of the island for the missing woman’s body or evidence in the case. Their search will be focused on the most southern, rural parts of the island which is more desert-like and uninhabited. Giordano - a twice divorced father-of-three -  is still fighting the accusations and is being held in an Aruban prison. He still denies anything to do with Robyn's disappearance and claims she vanished while they were out snorkelling. Police . are looking at a rock which is said to have a full hand print and blood . on it that was found behind a restaurant that the pair were said to . have dined in before her disappearance. Being held: A judge on Monday granted a request from Aruban prosecutors to extend the detention of Giordano for 16 days . Trouble in paradise: Robyn Gardner was seen at this restaurant on the afternoon that she vanished . On Monday Giordano was ordered to remain in an Aruban jail for another 16 days while police investigate 'serious inconsistencies' in his account of events. The American Express accidental policy is currently being investigated by the FBI. Court documents show the 50-year-old has a history of domestic violence, has not been charged but remains the only suspect in the case. His attorney has said he had nothing to do with her disappearance and has called for his release from jail. Officers having been tracing the movements of Giordano in the hours before Ms Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees. Inconsistencies? Gary Giordano, left, speaks with detectives at Baby Beach on the day after Robyn Gardner disappeared . The scene: The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino in Oranjestad, where Ms Gardner and Mr Giordano were reportedly staying during the holiday . Video shows the pair at the Rum Beef Bar & Grill in the Baby Beach area of the island where Ms Gardner went missing. Restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate. Surveillance footage also shows Giordano in his rental car at the back of the restaurant, but the car had tinted windows so no one else in the vehicle can be seen.

As the poster girl for the Paralympics, the hopes of Britain were once again heaped on her small shoulders. But yesterday – on the final full day of competition – swimmer Ellie Simmonds just missed out on an historic golden hat-trick after she was beaten into second place by long-time rival Victoria Arlen in the 100m freestyle. It was a fitting climax for the most successful Paralympics ever – the struggle for supremacy between the 17-year-olds has ignited the public's interest in disabled sport. Arlen took an early lead in . yesterday's race before storming down the final length to win in a . world-record time. Afterwards the great rivals embraced over the lane . ropes. Simmonds said: 'I . gave it everything on the last 50m but I just didn't have anything left. I am really happy – I would have loved to get the gold, but you can't . have everything.' Arlen . said: 'I don't even know how to react, I was in shock. When you look up . at the results, there is no feeling to describe it.' The drama of their rivalry has spanned the 11-day duration of the Paralympics. Two days before the Opening Ceremony, . Arlen was left distraught after being kicked out of the Games for not . being impaired enough by her disability. However, she was reinstated on . appeal just in time to allow her to do battle with Simmonds for the . first time in the 400m freestyle last Saturday. Then, the British heroine seized the lead in the final few metres to win the 'race of the Games', leaving the feisty American 'growling with anger'. But Arlen yesterday extracted sweet revenge by defeating Simmonds to take gold in the 100m freestyle. Ever since Simmonds's first golden performance, television figures for the Paralympics have gone through the roof. Her victory last Saturday was watched by 2.9 million viewers. Five days later 5.5 million saw track star David Weir take home his 800m title, and 6.7 million tuned in to see Jonnie Peacock defeat 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius in the 100m. There have also been sellout crowds. A record 2.7million people attended the Games, surpassing attendances at the Beijing Paralympics by 900,000. The Games have raised £45 million as corporate sponsors have rushed to take advantage of the enormous exposure the Paralympics has provided. Scroll down for video . Ellie Simmonds holds her silver medal as she stands on the podium next to long-term rival Victoria Arlen of the U.S. British success has also helped. As of yesterday, ParalympicGB was ranked third in the medals table with 115 in total, including 32 golds, surpassing the team's haul from Beijing four years ago. Yesterday's medallists included  cyclist David Stone, who successfully defended his title in the road race at Brands Hatch.

The 31-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, took part in the 2000 Paralympics before giving up the sport for several years to travel to India. He resumed his career in time to win two gold medals in 2008. David Smith won silver in the boccia and there was a bronze for Harriet Lee in the 100m breaststroke. Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of the British Paralympic Association, said the Paralympics must 'build on the momentum' the London Games has created. He added: 'I defy anyone to say that some of the remarkable victories we have seen at these Games have not been among some of the greatest moments in British sport.' David Smith, pictured, won silver in the boccia and there was a bronze for Harriet Lee in the 100m breaststroke . Nobody has quite captured the public's affection as much as the 4ft 1in Simmonds, from Walsall, who also won the 200m individual medley. Ellie, who has a form of short-limbed dwarfism, was already the subject of adulation after winning two golds in Beijing as an irrepressible 13-year-old but the courage of her performances at these Games took it to a different level. Her father Steve Simmonds said last night: 'She delivers on the right stage and there's no bigger stage than this. She's done herself, us and her country proud. 'Just because she didn't win tonight doesn't mean she hasn't given every ounce of what she's got.' He added his daughter sent him a text message about her experience at the Games. He said: 'The last thing she said was, “I don't want it to end.” She loves it, she loves the whole atmosphere, she loves being in there, she loves being with the team, she loves being in the village.' Simmonds has helped changed attitudes towards disability, he added. 'People like Oscar Pistorius, David Weir and Ellie have created a culture with the Paralympics,' he said. 'People come to watch high performance, honed, trained athletes perform to the best of their ability. Years ago they came to the freak show. It's what Ellie's been hammering away at for four years. It's all about getting sport out there, getting disability sport more known, accepted and understood. 'She's aware that people look at her and they see a star athlete. She thinks it's important that people understand that she's just her. She just happens to be good at something that people look up to and have respect for.' Crying wolf: Weir fan dresses up as a weirwolf in tribute to the wheelchair athlete . All eyes will be on David Weir today as he aims to clinch his fourth gold medal of the Games. 'The Weirwolf' has already set the Olympic Stadium alight with three outstanding performances in the 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m wheelchair track events. Now the streets of London are expected to ring out with his trademark battle-cry 'howl' as he takes part in the marathon. Weir's team-mates developed the 'Weirwolf' call after adapting it from the 1978 rock song Werewolves Of London, by Warren Zevon. 'It's pretty good,' said Weir, 33, who  was born with a severed spinal cord which left him unable to use his legs. And Weir's exploits have certainly endeared him to fans. Sonny Carter, 12, from Hemel Hempstead, said: 'He makes me proud to be British.' A paralympian who was forced to compete on one leg will return home with two, thanks to the Games' support team. Haitian Josue Cajuste was born without half his left leg and could not afford a £5,000 prosthesis. The 2010 Haiti earthquake also meant he had to train for the shot put and javelin among rubble. Haiti's Josue Cajuste competes in the men's javelin F42 final during the London 2012 Paralympic Games . The 29-year-old came last in the shot because he was unable to compete with other athletes who had prosthetics. Afterwards, Josue's coach pleaded for help from German prosthetic company Ottobock, which offers free services to Paralympians. Technicians were so moved by his story they built him his first ever replacement leg. With his new limb allowing him to take a run-up, Josue threw a Haitian record of 32m in Friday's javelin heats and finished 11th. 'The cheer of the crowd when I was on the runway was incredible,' he said. 'I shall never forget it.' VIDEO: Ellie Simmonds looks back on London 2012 .","Arlen took an early lead in .

Pope Benedict got no respite over the weekend from the ongoing Vatileaks scandal after documents emerged showing that his butler was not the only person in possession of confidential correspondence indicating a Vatican in disarray. Benedict, 85, ended a weekend trip to Italy's industrial and financial capital Milan with a closing mass for an international gathering in which he praised traditional Catholic family values and re-stated his opposition to gay marriage. But it came as the Rome newspaper La Repubblica published leaked documents it received anonymously after the arrest of the Pope's butler on May 23. No respite: Pope Benedict XVI waves to thousands of pilgrims as he arrives in his Popemobile at Bresso Airport near Milan to celebrate open mass as the Vatileaks scandal rumbles on . Rome newspaper La Repubblica has published leaked documents it received anonymously after the arrest of the Pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele (bottom left) on May 23 . Gabriele (right, carrying bags), 45, is currently being held on charges of aggravated theft but if he is charged with divulging state secrets he could receive a prison sentence of up to 30 years . A note received by the newspaper said there were 'hundreds more' documents and that the butler, Paolo Gabriele, was just a scapegoat. The newspaper said that in the note the person who sent the documents said the contents . had been whited out 'so as not to offend the Holy Father' but it contained a threat . to reveal them. The furore over the leaked correspondence, which shows power-hungry cardinals and scheming within the walls of the city state, has gripped the Vatican just as it was recovering from a long-running scandal over sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests in the United States, Ireland and other countries. One letter, dated January 16, was sent by Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American who heads a Vatican department, to the Pope's secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone. Burke complains that a decision regarding a liturgical matter was taken without consulting his office, which is responsible for such matters. The person who sent Repubblica the documents also provided two letters signed by the Pope's private secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein. The newspaper said those letters had everything but the letterhead and the signature whited out. Pope Benedict XVI acknowledges the thousands of pilgrims after celebrating an open air mass at Bresso Airport yesterday . Thousands gather for the mass celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI on the last day of the 7th World Meeting of Families at Bresso airport near Milan . Meanwhile, butler Gabriele, who is being held in a 'safe room' in the Vatican's police station, is expected to be questioned this week by a Vatican prosecutor who will decide if there are grounds to order him to stand trial. Gabriele, 45, is currently being held on charges of aggravated theft but if he is charged with divulging state secrets he could receive a prison sentence of up to 30 years. The person who sent the documents to the paper said Bertone and Ganswein were 'those really responsible for this scandal'. During his weekend trip to Milan, the pope has made no reference to the affair, which began in January 2011 when an Italian television show first aired leaked documents alleging cronyism and corruption in the Vatican. Last week, Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi published the book 'His Holiness', which contained more documents. In his sermon closing the event in Milan, the Pope, speaking to a crowd of one million who had come from as far away as Zimbabwe and New Zealand, stressed again that the family must be based on marriage between man and woman and open to the possibility of having children. The ceremony at a park in Milan's northern outskirts was attended by Italian leaders including Prime Minister Mario Monti. The Pope made no mention of the leaks scandal but spoke of the damage to family life that modern society can inflict. He said: 'The one-sided logic of sheer utility and maximum profit are not conducive to harmonious development, to the good of the family or to building a more just society. '(This) brings in its wake ferocious competition, strong inequalities, degradation of the environment, the race for consumer goods, family tensions'. But he has previously said of the scandal: 'The events of recent days about the Curia and my collaborators have brought sadness in my heart.' But he added: 'I want to renew my trust in and encouragement of my closest collaborators and all those who every day, with loyalty and a spirit of sacrifice and in silence, help me fulfill my ministry.'","The Vatileaks scandal broke in January after a journalist revealed letters from a Vatican administrator begging the Pope not to sack him for corruption .

Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, described the figures as 'shocking' More than 30 hospital trusts have amassed debts totalling £300million, it has emerged. The amount of taxpayers’ money being used to bail out stricken hospitals has trebled in the past year. Only last week it was announced South London Healthcare was being put into special measures as it is on the brink of going bust. Today a report by the National Audit Office warns it and another 30 trusts are in the red, with total debts of £307million. The Government blames much of the debt on controversial private finance initiative deals, which were expanded under Labour. The NAO warned that the Government cannot afford to carry on bailing out the trusts. There are also concerns that the hospitals’ dire financial situation will lead to worsening patient care. Last year £253million of public money was given to failing hospitals to help them cover everyday running costs – more than treble the £76million spent the previous year. Next year the bailout bill is likely to rise to £300million. Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee said: ‘It is shocking that over the past year alone the amount the Department for Health has had to spend on bailing out trusts in financial difficulty rose by 333 per cent. ‘Trusts in particular received significant support; South London Healthcare NHS Trust and Barking and Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust.’ The Government blames much of the debt on botched PFI deals which were encouraged by the Labour government. These enabled private firms to pay up front for a new cancer ward or maternity department, for example, and the trust would then pay them back in yearly instalments. Last week it was announced South London Healthcare - responsible for Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Woolwich, pictured - was being put into special measures as it is on the brink of going bust . But this amount goes up with interest every year and trusts also have to spend large amounts of money maintaining the buildings so they are ‘new’. As such, many have been unable to make these repayments. The NAO warns that in future, the NHS will not be able to afford to continue bailing these trusts out. It points out that there is unlikely to be any increase in Government spending on the NHS - once inflation is taken into account - for at least the next three years. The future of South London Healthcare trust is uncertain but health secretary Andrew Lansley is likely to make a decision later this year. It covers three hospitals - Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington and Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup in Kent and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, South London - and any may be closed-down.","Taxpayers' money spent on bailing out hospitals has trebled .

Dr Stephen Graham is alleged to have touched three women inappropriately at as hospital in Middlesbrough . A senior doctor leered at naked patients and fondled their breasts while they were under anaesthetic, a medical tribunal has been told. Dr Stephen Graham, 54, pushed the breasts of one sedated woman together and then turned to colleagues and explained: ‘It’s a Wonderbra technique.’ On another occasion he allegedly shone a light on to a naked patient, for no medical reason, and stared over the shoulder of a nurse as the page was prepared for surgery. In a separate incident he is said to have taken off the theatre gown of an unconscious patient before repeatedly cupping her breasts during an examination. Nurses shocked by his behaviour eventually complained to hospital bosses. Yesterday the consultant appeared before a General Medical Council tribunal where he faced misconduct charges. If they are proved, Graham, who has more than 25 years’ experience in hospital medicine, could be struck off. The hearing was told that Graham, a consultant anaesthetist based at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, specialises in scoliosis – a condition in which a person’s spine is curved from side to side. In serious cases it often requires surgery to correct. Nurses at the hospital made complaints about him following alleged incidents involving seven patients dating back to March 2006. Bernadette Baxter, for the GMC, said nurses had concerns he was behaving in a sexually motivated way towards women patients. Graham is accused of touching a sedated patient’s breasts inappropriately while checking if she was lying on a special operating mattress correctly. The ‘Montreal Mattress’ has a cut out section to prevent any pressure building up on a patient’s breasts during surgery on the spine. But a member of staff said she saw the doctor put his hands under the bed and pull the patient’s breasts up and then push them both together. When he was questioned about this, Miss Baxter said Graham explained it was ‘a Wonderbra technique and gestured with his own hands pushing upwards and inwards’. Miss Baxter said one sedated young woman being treated for scoliosis was inappropriately stared at by the doctor as she was being prepared for theatre. More...

Nurse Deborah Troy complained that for no apparent reason the doctor moved the patient’s legs and shone an examination light on her crotch. She said the consultant anaesthetist then stood staring as the nurse prepared the patient for surgery. Nurse Troy was said to be surprised and asked the doctor exactly what he was doing. Miss Baxter continued: ‘Dr Graham didn’t respond, didn’t switch the light off or remove it and effectively stared at the patient’s naked vaginal area. ‘Deborah Troy didn’t understand why the doctor was there. He didn’t explain why he’d done what he was doing.’ On another occasion nurse Karen Dawson complained Graham had inappropriately touched a woman’s breasts while the patient was sedated. She said she and other staff had been moving the patient in the recovery bay after surgery. Miss Baxter said: ‘Karen Dawson saw that Dr Graham effectively used his hand to cup the whole of the patient’s right breast with his other hand on the opposite side of her body, the ribcage area. ‘With his hands in that position he effectively moved the patient from side to side and then stood back effectively to see if her breasts were straight. ‘There was absolutely no clinical need for that action to be undertaken and no circumstances that Karen Dawson could see that it was appropriate for the doctor to have touched the patient’s breasts in the way that he had.’ In another incident, Miss Dawson claimed Graham ran his fingers along her spine after she asked him a medical question. Miss Baxter said he ran his hand or fingers along the length of her spine, from her neck to a couple of inches above her coccyx. She added: ‘This touching was not necessary to answer the question and she was shocked and uncomfortable at the closeness of Dr Graham and the fact that he had touched her in what she regarded as quite an intimate way.’ The GMC hearing in Manchester was told that in another claim Dr Graham removed the theatre gown of a sedated patient and inappropriately touched her breasts. Miss Baxter said: ‘He took off the  theatre gown so that the patient was completely naked and placed it at the side of her as she was unconscious. He didn’t just listen with his stethoscope. He took hold of the patient’s breasts, cupping them in both hands.’","Dr Stephen Graham 'moved one patient's legs and shone a light on her private parts'

It has emerged Renaissance artist Titian may have painted himself into the grim scene. Experts restoring his 15ft-high The Martyrdom of St Lawrence have uncovered a man in a turban in the bottom corner. Artist's face? The Martyrdom of St Lawrence, which has undergone a year-long restoration, apparently shows artist Titian's face in the bottom-left corner . The man’s face, tilted upwards and looking towards the burning man, bears a looks remarkably likeness to the artist himself. Titian completed the work in the late 1550s – but the apparent self-portrait has gone undetected for more than 450 years, the Daily Telegraph reported. St Lawrence, one of the seven deacons of Ancient Rome, was martyred in 258 for his beliefs. Professor Lionello Puppi, a Titian expert, said the man’s face in the corner looked incredibly like that of the artist. Resemblance: The face in the painting looks remarkably like artist Titian, pictured . ‘The similarity with the profile, and particularly the long, slightly hooked nose, is very striking,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘We believe it may very well be a self-portrait by Titian. It is still to be verified and we are studying the archives to see if there are any other clues which might back it up. ‘The key question of course is why he would have included himself in the painting.’ Titian was born in around 1488 and named Tiziano Vecellio. The painting was completed over more than a decade between around 1546 and 1558s. Titian would have been aged in his late 50s or 60s at the time – about the same age as the man who appears in the bottom left hand corner of the portrait. The work, estimated to be worth £40million, has undergone a year-long restoration programme. The work is on display in Alba, north-east Italy, until August when it will return to Venice and the Church of the Jesuits.

Laid to rest in a 17ft boat with his sword, axe and bronze drinking horn, the powerful Norseman’s burial site has been discovered by archaeologists in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands.

But in the 870s, Alfred – and later . his descendants – united England against the Viking invaders, driving . them out of their English strongholds and back to Scandinavia.

Close inspection: Dr Hannah Cobb, co-director of the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, studies a viking sword . The Anglo-Saxons, by now ruled by the . hapless Aethelred the Unready,  were once again put to the sword, and . huge amounts of money and goods were extorted from the native population . in the form of Danegeld – a tax raised by the Vikings. By 1016, the conquest was completed when Canute became the first Danish king of all England. It is from this period that the tomb . dates, and its elaborate contents show how wealthy the Vikings had . become. Many were converting to Christianity at the time, but from the . artefacts laid to rest alongside him, it is clear this nobleman had been . firmly committed to the old Norse religion.

David Cameron has referred Baroness Warsi to his independent adviser on ministerial interests over an official trip she made to Pakistan with a business partner. It is the first time the Prime Minister has referred a minister to Sir Alex Allan, who rules on whether politicians have broken the Ministerial Code. The move contrasts with Mr Cameron’s refusal to ask Sir Alex to investigate Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt over his closeness to the Murdoch media empire. Baroness Warsi yesterday issued a grovelling apology for failing to disclose her shared business interest with Abid Hussain, a relative. The beleaguered Tory Party co-chairman apologised for any ‘embarrassment to the Government’. In response, the PM said: ‘There are clearly some lessons for future handling and I have asked Alex Allan, my adviser on ministers’ interests, to consider the issues that have been raised.’ Baroness Warsi’s position is precarious because she is unpopular with some Tory backbenchers, who want Mr Cameron to appoint an MP to the Tory chairmanship to give the position more authority. Downing Street, however, is understood to rate the minister and is keen to keep her in the Cabinet. One rumour is that she could be given the job of International Development Secretary, in charge of Britain’s aid programme, in a reshuffle later this year. Pressure: David Cameron is being attacked by Labout for referring Baroness Warsi to Sir Alex Allen but not Jeremy Hunt . However, if Sir Alex rules against her, it could spell the end for her ministerial career. The referral relates to an undeclared relationship with Mr Hussain, who accompanied her to Pakistan in July 2010 and assisted the British High Commission with outreach events there. She said Mr Hussain was her husband’s second cousin and this fact was ‘widely known’. But she added that she did not realise the need to declare they had ‘a common business interest as minority shareholders in a small food company’. Labour’s Michael Dugher, shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘Baroness Warsi clearly has very serious questions to answer. ‘But David Cameron’s actions in this case draw into sharp relief his refusal to hold a similar investigation into Jeremy Hunt, despite clear evidence that he broke the Ministerial Code by misleading the House of Commons on at least three occasions.’",Tory party co-chairman faces questions over business interests .
"PUBLISHED: . 10:53 EST, 7 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:40 EST, 8 May 2012 . Made of stern stuff: Private Craig Paterson grins in spite of his alarming injury as he recovers in Birmingham last July . A young soldier told today how he continued to fire his gun in a deadly shootout with the Taliban - despite being shot in the head. Private Craig Paterson was three months into a tour in the troubled Helmand Province of Afghanistan last July when his unit was pinned down on a rooftop by an enemy sniper. Pte Paterson, 22, was desperate to stay in the fight alongside his comrades and kept firing back, holding the enemy away from the building. The soldier, from Inverurie, . Aberdeenshire, said: 'We were on an operation and we had been dropped in . the middle of nowhere. I’m a sharp shooter so I was told to go onto the . roof of this building. 'Four . of us had been on the roof when fire started coming in and we were . quickly pinned down. I can remember the bullets and mortars flying . around my head. 'I knew . there was a sniper out there and I was looking for him. It happened . very quickly - I put my head up and he got me. 'I can't remember much after I . was shot. But I must have been determined to get the sniper as the guys . said I continued firing at him, even though I was in and out of . consciousness.' Pte . Paterson eventually collapsed and lay . helpless on the roof until a paramedic came to his rescue. He added: 'The next time I woke up I . was in a hospital in Birmingham.' The medic - nicknamed Mother by fellow soldiers of 4 Scots, the Royal Regiment of Scotland - shielded the stricken soldier with her body as they were sprayed with heavy gunfire and ricocheting bullets. Royal Navy reservist Michelle Ping, 37, from Leeds, was later mentioned in dispatches in recognition of her gallantry. Saved: The 22-year-old shows a surgery scar lined with staples following an operation to fit hiim with a titanium plate under his scalp . Grisly souvenir: Pte Paterson holds up a bag containing pieces of his skull that were removed after he was hit by a Taliban sniper . He said: 'As soon as she saw my eyes she thought I was dead. But she told me she shouted at me ""I’m not having that"" and she shook me back to life and looked after me. 'I’m so grateful for what she did. She saved my life. We’re best of friends and she is coming up to Aberdeen next Friday to see me to see how I’m getting on.' Pte Paterson suffered a brain injury as the bullet drove through a neat puncture in the front of his helmet and punched a large exit hole at the back. He was then airlifted to Kandahar, where an American surgeon carried out a delicate operation on his head, removing a piece from the top of his skull and inserting a titanium plate held in place by 32 tiny screws. 'We're best of friends': Pte Paterson, shown following his recovery,  wears a leg support after his injury left him with weakness in his right side. His life was saved thanks to the efforts of brave medic Michelle Ping (right) Highland warrior: Pte Paterson, from Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, pictured on duty in Afghanistan. He was three month into a tour of the turbulent Helmand province when he was shot . Pte Paterson said: 'I now have a metal plate in my skull - although I have kept the piece of my skull in an envelope upstairs as a war souvenir. 'I’ve tested the metal plate to see if it magnetic, but it doesn’t seem to be. I don’t know yet what effect it may have on airport security metal detectors.' After the operation in Kandahar, he spent three days in an induced coma before he was flown back to Britain. He spent a month in a Birmingham hospital before being transferred to a military rehabilitation unit in Surrey for seven months, where he was told his stubborn Scottish nature helped his speedy recovery. Ready for action: The young soldier in full battle gear before he was nearly killed in Afghanistan . Giving back: Pte Paterson in the customised bike he will ride in a 510-mile challenge in aid of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association . Despite now having a severe weakness in the right side of his body, Craig is happy to be alive and wants to give back to the charities which helped save his life. When the Highlander returned home a few weeks ago he immediately signed up to raise cash for the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association by doing a five-day, 510-mile Ride of Britain cycling event in September on a specially adapted bike. He said: 'I have been getting in training around an Inverurie to Monymusk circuit. It’s another challenge but I’ll do it to help SSAFA continue their great work. It meant so much to us to be together.'","Private Craig Paterson, 22, was hit by a sniper in Helmand, Afghanistan .

Pope Benedict broke his silence today over the scandal of leaked documents that has convulsed the Vatican, saying he was saddened by the betrayal. Benedict made his first direct comments on the scandal in off-the-cuff remarks at the end of his weekly general audience. He lashed out at some of the media reports about the scandal, saying the 'exaggerated' and 'gratuitous' rumors had offered a false image of the Holy See. Saddened: Pope Benedict waves during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's square at the Vatican today. He said he was 'saddened' by the Vatileaks scandal . The Italian media have been on a frenzy ever since the pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele, was arrested last week after Vatican investigators discovered papal documents in his Vatican City apartment. He remains in detention and has pledged to cooperate fully with the investigation. Rumors have been flying in the press about possible cardinals implicated in the probe, pending resignations and details of the investigation that even Gabriele's lawyers say they haven't heard. The Vatican spokesman has spent much of his daily briefings in recent days shooting down the various reports. The Vatileaks scandal represents one of the greatest breaches of trust and security for the Holy See in recent memory given that a significant number of documents from the pope's own desk were leaked to an investigative journalist. The Vatican has denounced the leaks as criminal and immoral and has opened a three-pronged investigation to get to the bottom of who was responsible. 'The events of recent days about the Curia and my collaborators have brought sadness in my heart,' Benedict said at the end of his audience. But he added: 'I want to renew my trust in and encouragement of my closest collaborators and all those who every day, with loyalty and a spirit of sacrifice and in silence, help me fulfill my ministry.' Few people think Gabriele worked alone, and his promise to cooperate with the investigation has fueled speculation that other might be arrested soon. The motivations for the leaks remain unclear: Some commentators say they appear designed to discredit Benedict's No. 2, the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone. Scandal: Pope Benedict broke his silence about the leaks which have been deemed the greatest breech of trust in recent memory . Pope Benedict XVI gives his blessing during the weekly general audience in St. Peter's square at the Vatican, today. He said he wanted to publicly express his trust in his closest advisers . Others say they're aimed at undermining the Vatican's efforts to become more financially transparent. Still others say they aim to show the 85-year-old Benedict's weakness in running the church. On Tuesday, the Vatican undersecretary of state, Archbishop Angelo Becciu, lashed out at what he called an unprecedented, ""brutal"" attack on the pope, saying the stolen papers didn't just concern matters of internal church governance but represented the thoughts of people who in writing to the pope believed they were essentially speaking before God. 'It's not just that the pope's papers were stolen, but that people who turned to him as the vicar of Christ have had their consciences violated,' Becciu told the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano. The Vatileaks scandal broke in January when Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi revealed letters from a former top Vatican administrator who begged the pope not to transfer him for having exposed alleged corruption that cost the Holy See millions of euros in higher contract prices. The prelate, Monsignor Carlo Maria Vigano, is now the Vatican's U.S. ambassador. Grateful: The Pontiff told how he was grateful to those aides who work faithfully and in silence to help him do his job . The scandal widened over the following months with documents leaked to Italian journalists that laid bare power struggles inside the Vatican over its efforts to show greater financial transparency and comply with international norms to fight money laundering. There was even a leak of a memo claiming that Benedict would die this year. The scandal reached a peak last weekend, when Nuzzi published an entire book based on a trove of new documentation, including personal correspondence to and from the pope and his private secretary, much of which paints Bertone in a negative light. The Vatican has warned of legal action for those who stole, received and disseminated the documents. Nuzzi, who in 2009 published a book on leaked documents from the Vatican bank, has justified the publication as an act of transparency.","The Vatileaks scandal broke in January after a journalist revealed letters from a Vatican administrator begging the pope not to sack him for corruption .

On first appearance this luxury family home that has come up for sale looks like it could be the residence of a wealthy stockbroker or lawyer. In fact the £700,000 property in an affluent, leafy suburb is actually the home of a major drug dealer and his wife. Craig Blake, 40, is serving 16 years in jail for his role in leading a gang that flooded British streets with cocaine worth £125million. Secure: This gated detached home in Bournemouth's upmarket Talbot Woods has been put on the market after a court demanded the jailed drug dealer repay his ill-gotten gains . His wife, Fiona, 41, was jailed for three years for laundering money from her husband’s multi-million pound empire. But a court has now ruled that Blake must repay nearly £800,000 of his ill-gotten gains under the Proceeds of Crime Act or face an extra four years on his sentence. In order to do that he has put his large detached home in the upmarket Talbot Woods area of Bournemouth, Dorset, on the market. Jailed: Cocaine dealer Craig Blake, 40, is serving 16 years for his criminal involvement with a gang that flooded British streets with the drug . But his wife, who lives there with her . son, 15, and the couple’s daughter, four, is worried about the sale of . the property due to the stigma of ‘buying a drug dealer’s house’. The house has four large bedrooms, a large reception hall, sitting room, family room, gymnasium and therapy room, study, two bathrooms, electronic front gates and a large back garden. It also has underfloor heating and air conditioning in some rooms. Estate agents selling it describe the property as an ‘exceptional family home situated in the heart of the prestigious location'. A spokesman from Cliftons estate agents said: 'We have been instructed to sell the house by the occupier and the house is now on the market. 'We are the instructing agent and the response has been great. We have had a number of viewings and it is only a matter of time before we reach sale agreed.' Blake and his gang of drug traffickers operated in Dorset, Kent and South Wales between 2007 and 2009 and made more than £1million a month supplying cocaine. They also shipped cocaine to Australia by stashing thousands of pounds of the class A drug into tins of Waitrose soup. The men owned large houses and drove round in expensive cars and generally led lavish lifestyles.

Blake, his fellow ringleader Robert Quick, 46, and other gang members were caught after officers from Serious Organiser Crime Agency bugged their cars and phone calls as they trafficked drugs along the south coast and the Welsh valleys. The men were jailed in July 2010 at Cardiff Crown Court. Blake admitted charges of conspiracy to supply class A drugs. Last month at the same court his Honour Judge Hopkins QC made Blake subject of the Confiscation Order worth £792,055. His wife Fiona said: 'He was a builder, and he had rented property, I didn’t think anything different, as far as I was concerned he was a successful property developer. 'I’m at home with the children, and he was a perfect husband and a perfect dad.

Prince Pierre Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline and grandson of Grace Kelly, was allegedly punched in the face after sparking a row with a stranger in a swanky New York nightclub. Witnesses claim that Prince Pierre was 'jealous' of Adam Hock because he was sitting with a woman that the Prince was interested in. Prince Pierre Casiraghi (left) was allegedly punched by Adam Hock (right) after he behaved 'obnoxiously' in a New York night club . Prince Pierre and his entourage, who were drinking £350 bottles of champagne, are said to have gone over to Hock’s table and started behaving ‘obnoxiously’. Hock allegedly punched Pierre and sent him flying into a table on the other side of the room, where he landed with blood pouring from his face. ‘Pierre’s face looked broken, with deep cuts and blood everywhere,’ said one witness. ‘He looked like he needed plastic surgery.’ Hock, 47, was arrested and charged with four counts of assault against the Prince and three of his friends. Hock denies the charges. Yesterday the prince presented a letter to Manhattan Criminal Court from his royal physicians claiming the brawl had left him so badly injured that he was unable to work for a month.

An aspiring model who used stolen credit cards to pay for expensive cosmetic surgery to bolster her fledgling career  walked free from court today. Faileigh Cooper, 23, splashed £6,850 on liposuction and lip enhancements with around £4,000 coming from stolen card details she was given by a man she met in a nightclub. Cooper, who is now two months pregnant, told the court she ‘dreamed of being a model’ and claimed she had no idea the card details she used were stolen. Convicted: Faileigh Cooper, 23, seen arriving at Southwark Crown Court during her five-day trial, used stolen credit cards to pay for cosmetic surgery in an attempt to improve her prospects of making it as a model . She also alleged that the surgery had left her with a burnt arm and was considering legal action. Prosecutors said she was part of a plot with the man she said she knew only as 'Aaron' to defraud the Dr Alexandra Chambers Medical and Aesthetic Practice, on Wimpole Street, central London. The pair were said to have repeatedly called the surgery where Cooper paid a £500 deposit to pay the balance, with around £4,000 coming from the stolen cards. During the trial, jurors heard Cooper booked her treatment and paid a £500 deposit before paying the rest over the phone using a variety of cards. Cooper and 'Aaron' called the surgery 14 times between February 21 and February 23 last year using both legitimate and fraudulent cards to pay off the balance. The clinic was later informed that the card payments were fraudulent, leaving them out of pocket. When asked by her legal team if she had ‘any reason to doubt’ that the cards belonged to 'Aaron’ she replied: ‘No’. She described Aaron as ‘very flashy’ and said when she first met him in a club he had been ‘trying to get a lot of attention buying bottles of champagne costing over £200’. Spared jail: Cooper was not ordered to pay legal costs and compensation because her conviction at Southwark Crown Court means she is likely to lose her job and be unable to afford the fines . Cooper said: ‘He offered to pay so he would then contact the clinic and pay the full amount.’ She insisted she believed the card did belong to ‘Aaron’, who later told Cooper he was too busy to make the payments and asked her to try for him and supplied the details. The Judge, Mr Recorder James Mulholland QC, told her: ‘You made a series of false representations to Dr Alexandra Chambers Medical and Aesthetic Practice by using a series of eight cards, many of which did not belong to you. ‘This was a very strange case in many ways. ‘It struck me that it was almost inevitable that you would be apprehended as the surgery had your name and the address at which you resided. ‘But equally the evidence and the jury’s verdict that you would have had to have known through the number of cards, the way they were used, the constant rejections and re-submissions that what you were doing was dishonest cause it just could not have been operated in any other fashion.’ The former House of Fraser and BBC Children in Need model, of Battersea, southwest London, had denied four counts of fraud, was convicted by a jury of four counts of fraud after a five day trial in April. Cooper was convicted and given a 12 month community order and told to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work. An application for £4,000 in compensation and a contribution of £1,875 towards prosecution costs was reject on the grounds Cooper’s conviction would see her lose her job and she would have no money to pay. ‘I feel it would be wrong in the circumstance to impose any such order,’ said the judge. Prosecutor Orla Daly said today: ‘The four convictions for fraud relate to the use of credit cards in order to pay for cosmetic procedures which she was not entitled to use.’","Faileigh Cooper, 23, spent £6,850 on liposuction and lip enhancements - £4,000 of which came from stolen cards, but was spared jail today .

The veil-wearing former wife of terrorist Mohammed Merah says the couple played violent video games including Call of Duty together before he gunned down seven people in cold blood.

But Miriam, who was married to Merah for 17 days before his death, said: ‘We had many religious conversations, but we spent our time playing PlayStation, including Call of Duty and Need for Speed.’ Call of Duty, a so-called ‘shooter’ video game, depicts a battlefield in which heavily armed troops fight it out to the death. It has often been criticised for glorifying violence, and for encouraging vulnerable young people towards anti-social behaviour. But Miriam, who became Merah’s bride as a young teenager infront of an Imam, said he was a ‘kind and gentle husband’, adding: ‘We also watched The Simpsons together. We talked a lot and he needed someone to listen. 'He needed love and I compared him to a baby.’ Final moments: Officers laid siege to Merah's home in Toulouse.

They were filed away and for nearly 150 years, but now researchers have found the report of the young army surgeon who was first to reach Abraham Lincoln after he was shot in the head in Ford Theatre. The 21-page report, written by Dr Charles Leale, a 23-year-old doctor just six weeks into his medical practice who happened to be 40 feet from Lincoln, details his original perceptions of the president’s fatal injuries. The historians who discovered the report in the National Archives in Washington believe it was filed, packed in a box, stored at the archives and not seen for 147 years. Loss of a president: John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Southern nationalist, shot and killed President Abraham Lincoln during a performance at the Ford's Theatre in Washington on April 14, 1865 . Clinical report: Dr Charles Leale, 23, the first to treat Lincoln after he was shot, wrote a detailed report on his treatment hours after the shooting; the documents were recently discovered at the National Archives . Discovery: 147 years after the shooting, a researcher has discovered an original copy of Dr Leale's clinical 21-page report from the night Lincoln was shot . The doctor, who sat 40 feet from Lincoln at Ford's Theatre that night in April 1865, saw John Wilkes Booth jump to the stage, brandishing a dagger, and heard the cry that the 'President has been murdered' before pushing his way through the crowd. Great Emancipator: Lincoln, the 16th president, led the country through the Civil War . Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Dr Leale ordered men to cut off the president's coat. 'I commenced to examine his head (as no wound near the shoulder was found) and soon passed my fingers over a large firm clot of blood situated about one inch below the superior curved line of the occipital bone,' Dr Leale reported. ‘The coagula I easily removed and passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball, and found that it had entered the encephalon.' Dr Leale’s long-lost report also states that he immediately ‘sent a gentleman for brandy and water,’ and that he found the Great Emancipator ‘in a state of general paralysis.’ He describes: ‘His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous.’ A researcher for the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, Helena Iles Papaioannou, found it among correspondence of the U.S. surgeon general from April 1865, filed under 'L' for Leale. 'What's fascinating about this report is its immediacy and its clinical, just-the-facts approach,' Daniel Stowell, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, told the Associated Press. 'There's not a lot of flowery language, not a lot of emotion.' Physicians have long debated whether Mr Lincoln could have lived with modern medicine. Trauma treatment was virtually unknown in 1865, and Dr Leale's report illustrates 'the helplessness of the doctors,' Mr Stowell said. 'He doesn't say that but you can feel it.' Loss of a leader: An artist's rendering that appeared in Harper's Weekly depicts the grisly murder from another angle . Help nearby: Leale was some 40ft away from the president and rushed to his aide after the shooting at Ford Theater . Dr Leale wrote a report for an 1867 congressional committee investigating the assassination that referenced the earlier account, but no one had ever seen it, said Mr Stowell, whose group's goal is to find every document written by or to Abraham Lincoln during his lifetime. At least four researchers have been painstakingly scouring boxes of documents at the National Archives for more than six years. They methodically pull boxes of paper - there are millions of documents packed away and never catalogued, Mr Stowell said - and look for 'Lincoln docs,' as Ms Papaioannou called them. Assassination site: Ford's Theatre, located in Washington, D.C., was playing 'Our American Cousin' on April 14, 1865 . Consequences: On July 7, 1865, three men and one woman were hanged in Washington for their parts in the crime: Mrs. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt . She was assigned the surgeon general's documents and was leafing through letters pitching inventions for better ambulances and advice about feeding soldiers onions to ward off disease when she hit Dr Leale's report. 'I knew it was interesting. What we didn't know was this was novel,' Ms Papaioannou said. 'We didn't know that this was new, that this was an 1865 report and that it likely hadn't been seen before.' The surgeon never spoke or wrote about his experiences again until 1909 in a speech commemorating the centennial of Lincoln's birth. The Papers of Abraham Lincoln, administered by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, has found and is digitizing 90,000 documents, Mr Stowell said. I arrived at Ford’s Theatre about 8¼ P.M. April 14/65 and procured a seat in the dress circle about 40 feet from the President’s Box.  The play was then progressing and in a few minutes I saw the President, Mrs Lincoln, Major Rathbone and Miss Harris enter; while proceeding to the Box they were seen by the audience who cheered which was reciprocated by the President and Mrs Lincoln by a smile and bow. The party was preceded by an attendant who after opening the door of the box and closing it after they had all entered, took a seat nearby for himself. The theatre was well filled  and the play of “Our American Cousin” progressed very pleasantly until about half past ten, when the report of a pistol was distinctly heard and about a minute after a man of low stature with black hair and eyes was seen leaping to the stage beneath, holding in his hand a drawn dagger. While descending his heel got entangled in the American flag, which was hung in front of the box, causing him to stumble when he struck the stage, but with a single bound he regained the use of his limbs and ran to the opposite side of the stage, flourishing in his hand a drawn dagger and disappearing behind the scene. I then heard cries that the 'President had been murdered,' which were followed by those of 'Kill the murderer' 'Shoot him' etc. which came from different parts of the audience. I immediately ran to the Presidents box and as soon as the door was opened was admitted and introduced to Mrs. Lincoln when she exclaimed several times, 'O Doctor, do what you can for him, do what you can!' I told her we would do all that we possibly could. When I entered the box the ladies were very much excited.  Mr. Lincoln was seated in a high backed arm-chair with his head leaning towards his right side supported by Mrs. Lincoln who was weeping bitterly.  Miss Harris was near her left and behind the President. While approaching the President I sent a gentleman for brandy and another for water. When I reached the President he was in a state of general paralysis, his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous. I placed my finger on his right radial pulse but could perceive no movement of the artery.  As two gentlemen now arrived, I requested them to assist me to place him in a recumbent position, and as I held his head and shoulders, while doing this my hand came in contact with a clot of blood near his left shoulder. Supposing that he had been stabbed there I asked a gentleman to cut his coat and shirt off from that part, to enable me if possible to check the hemorrhage which I supposed took place from the subclavian artery or some of its branches. Before they had proceeded as far as the elbow I commenced to examine his head (as no wound near the shoulder was found) and soon passed my fingers over a large firm clot of blood situated about one inch below the superior curved line of the occipital bone.

Leading figures during the reign of the first Queen Elizabeth included Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh and William Shakespeare. A list of ‘New Elizabethans’, by contrast, features Barbara Windsor, Billy Connolly and Simon Cowell. DJs, fashion designers, pop stars and even shamed banker Fred Goodwin have also been selected by a panel of historians and experts for the list of 60 people said to have ‘defined’ the era of our Queen’s 60 years on the throne. Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair are the only Prime Ministers to be listed, with the impact of the others during the reign of Elizabeth II not deemed significant enough. Instead the list features Rupert  Murdoch, the under-fire head of News Corporation, footballer George Best who became an alcoholic, feminist writer Germaine Greer and even the DJ Goldie. The full list was announced yesterday in advance of a Radio 4 series, The New Elizabethans, to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. It examines how this Elizabethan age compares with that of Elizabeth I. Those selected were said to be ‘men and women whose actions in the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on the life of these islands, and/or given the age its character – for better or for worse’. The house of Windsor: Barbara Windsor, the Eastenders actress, was named as one of the 60 people who have defined the Queen's reign. Tony Blair, right, was one of only two Prime Ministers named in the list . On the list: TV executive Simon Cowell and unexpectedly DJ Goldie have both made the list of 60 people said to have defined the era of the Queen's 60 years on the throne . Nearly 1,000 names were submitted to the BBC by the public for consideration. A panel including historian and journalist Sir Max Hastings and Bamber Gascoigne, the original presenter of University Challenge, reduced them to the final 60. The Queen herself was added, despite serious debate on the panel whether she should qualify. Fred Goodwin is believed to have been selected because he was both a leading banker and represented the greed that has come to symbolise the industry. Recognition: Courageous Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teen Stephen Lawrence, and Indian-born author Salman Rushdie, pictured in 2008 were also chosen for the Radio 4 series . Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was selected for her courageous campaigning for victims of race crime. Bobby Moore and Sir Bobby Charlton, two of the heroes of England’s 1966 World Cup win, failed to make the list. Instead George Best was chosen because as the first celebrity footballer he was said to have a wider influence on popular culture, before his life was destroyed by alcohol. Perhaps the most unexpected entry is Goldie, the dance music DJ who has also appeared in East-Enders and Celebrity Big Brother. James Naughtie, who will write and present 60 profiles of the New Elizabethans in the series, said they made up a ‘glittering mosaic’ of this country in the second half of the twentieth century, touching ‘every corner of our lives’. The series will begin on June 11.

A career criminal with more than 100 offences has again walked free from court, despite getting a 'last chance' from the same judge two years ago. Judge Carol Hagen decided it was ‘not in the interests of justice’ to enact the suspended sentence drug addict Sundee Spaulding had been serving during her shoplifting spree. The mother-of-one, 25, already has 33 convictions for more than 100 theft-related and dishonesty crimes. But Judge Hagen gave her one ‘final chance’ and let her walk free – even though she had broken her supposed ‘last chance’ given after her last conviction. Lenient: Judge Carol Hagen, left, decided to spare career criminal Sundee Spaulding, right, who has more than 100 offences on her record jail because it was in the 'interests of justice' She told Spaulding: ‘You present me with a real problem Sundee Spaulding. You commit offence after offence and always there is some excuse on your part. ‘The question for me is do I send you to prison or not. I am persuaded that it is in the interests of justice that I do not activate that suspended sentence. ‘It seems to me to offer the best chance at this point in time to dissuade you from committing further criminal offences. ‘I’m giving you a final chance. If any of these conditions I impose are breached you are going to prison for 12 months. ‘This is a real opportunity.’ Bristol Crown Court was told Spaulding had stolen two meat joints from a Co-op, in Avonmouth, Somerset, on April 12. After handing herself in to police, Spaulding, from Shirehampton, Bristol, then tried to steal £241 worth of shopping from a nearby Asda in nearby Patchway. It was only when she tried to exit the store through a closed door and security guards approached her to tell her which door to leave by, that the theft was spotted. Nadeem Aullybocus, prosecuting, said: ‘Miss Spaulding has 33 convictions for an impressive 100 offences. ‘The defendant has had every single sentence the court could possibly give her. Alongside the thefts she has also breached her suspended sentence. ‘This is not the first time she has done this.’ Spaulding was given eight months suspended prison sentence by Judge Hagen in 2010 for handling stolen goods and shoplifting. On that occasion Neil Treharne, defending Spaulding, said: ‘She’s well aware that this is her last chance.’ Mr Treharne, again representing Spaulding today, asked the judge to give his client a spell at outreach centre Eden House Project instead of jail. Defending, Neil Treharne, said: ‘The Eden House Project is a very worthwhile project. ‘I have seen great success in the past and on this occasion I really think that Sundee is motivated and she would succeed. Swaggering: Sundee Spaulding, 25, could hardly contain her delight at being allowed to walk free from the same court where she had promised to mend her ways when notching up one of her previous 100 crimes . ‘I do see a vast change where she has gained an attitude where she wants to address the issues that she has. ‘The evidence for this is that she gave a negative reading for drugs when she was arrested.’ Judge Hagen backed the plea and handed Spaulding a ‘strict’ community order with numerous conditions attached including attending the Eden House Project. She was also given a 12-month community order, a 12-month supervision order and a six month drugs rehabilitation order. Spaulding also ordered to abide by a two month curfew from 8pm to 7am. Judge Hagen has previously been criticised for declining to send serious offenders to jail. Last year she refused to send prolific burglar Jason Reed to jail - before he went on to steal from 22 more homes. She then cut his jail term, after he was finally imprisoned. In 2010 she failed to send carer Jane Hoy to prison for stealing from one of her patients - despite describing her offence as a ‘gross breach of trust targeting a vulnerable victim’. Victim Lorraine Andrews said she had been left ‘absolutely gobsmacked’ by the decision. She was criticised in 2010 after a man who stabbed a neighbour over a text message to his girlfriend and a man with 3,400 indecent images of children both avoided custody. In February this year, jewel thief Mikey Rush, of Withywood, Bristol, was spared jail despite stealing £20,000-worth of goods from 11 shops.","Drug addict Sundee Spaulding promised was given 'one last chance' when she last appeared before the court for theft .

We we want mirror-like gloss, with the depth and finish of a sports car's paint job. The solution? Gel manicures - which have fast become the best way to get a high gloss, long-lasting manicure. Thanks to the specialist kit involved though, it has taken a professional manicurist to get such results - and it's costly too, with one gel manicure costing upwards of £25, and often a second payment needed to remove it. Dancing on Ice's chief make up artist Rene Metcalf used Sensationail on the contestants - including Emmerdale's Matthew Wolfenden . Now though, for the first time, a . home gel manicure kit has gone on sale in the UK - reducing the cost per . manicure to just £5.77. Nailene's . Sensationail kit features a high-tech breed of polish that takes . seconds to paint on and a couple of minutes to dry, or cure, as the . beauticians call it - but it lasts weeks. Nailene's home gel manicure kit comes with an LED lamp to 'cure' the polishes, meaning they last up to two weeks without chipping . The Nailene Sensationail Invincible Gel Polish Starter kit costs £85 - a seemingly high outlay for a manicure pack - but in the kit is everything you need to create a salon-finish manicure, including a primer, a special base and top coat, a colour, and files and wipes - as well as the LED UV lamp vital to set the polish. The kits, which sold out across 7,000 U.S. outlets in 24 hours, have now seen equally good sales in the UK . When it went on sale in the U.S., the Nailene manicure kit became the number one home gel kit in the country in its first 24 hours, selling out in over 7,000 stores including WalMart and CVS. Ahead of their sale in this country, the kits had a waiting list of over 10,000 with Nailene - and since hitting the shelves at Boots, they have caused a storm. Hailed 'the ultimate home gel manicure' by U.S. journalists and The Today Show, the kit claims to give identical results to a salon gel manicure, but at a fraction of the cost. The firm claims that the kit will pay for itself in under seven weeks, based on buyers carrying out one manicure every two weeks, with one home manicure working out at £5.77, compared to an average of £25 for a salon treatment. The kits, which launched into Boots stores earlier this month, went on to cause minor hysteria on the high street just days later, when it was revealed via Twitter that the Dancing on Ice chief make-up artist Rene Metcalfe had been using the kits on the skating show's contestants - including on Emmerdale's Matthew Wolfenden. 'It gives the most perfect and long-lasting finish during all the training and dancing on the show,' she said. 'And it makes it very easy to change the colour to match the costumes.' Following the revelations, sales soared over 523 per cent, and shoppers were reduced to snatching at the last boxes on the quickly depleted shelves. In fact, Boots have reported that 33 per cent of the sales in store have been to men - raising the question of whether they are buying it for themselves, or for their ladies. The starter kits are currently the only product available, but in May, individual colours will be available to buy in Boots stores at £15 per bottle.","Sales soared 523 per cent after Dancing on Ice make up artist tweeted she was using the Nailene kits .

We have all gone to lengths to avoid people we don't like - but it appears a group of tigers in Nepal have adopted a 'night shift' to better co-exist with their human neighbors. The lives of the tigers and people of Chitwan National Park fly in the face of long-held convictions in conservation circles - both sharing exactly the same space, including the same roads and trails . Jianguo Liu, director of the Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability,  and PhD student Neil Carter spent two seasons setting motion-detecting cameras to observe tigers, . their prey and people who walk the roads and trails of Chitwan, both in . and around the park. Chitwan, nestled in a valley of the Himalayas, is . home to about 121 tigers, while people live on the park's borders, but rely on . the forests for ecosystem services such as wood and grasses. The Chitwan National Park is home to elephants, rhinos, leopards and tigers - and people who live among the wildlife . 'Captured by the lens': PhD student Neil Carter set up multiple cameras to monitor tigers around the Nepal site . The local Chinese population also use the same routes through the forest, but both species seem to function fine on different 'shifts' The roads also are used by military patrols to . thwart would-be poachers, and all who venture on the dirt roads and narrow footpaths are 'snared' on Carter's . digital memory cards. Carter's analysis of the thousands of images show that people and tigers . are walking the same paths, albeit at different times. Tigers typically . move around at all times of the day and night, monitoring their . territory, mating and hunting. But in the study area, Carter and his . colleagues discovered that the tigers had become creatures of the night. The camera's infrared lights document a pronounced shift toward . nocturnal activity. People in Nepal generally avoid the forests at . night. Essentially, quitting time for people signals starting time for . Chitwan's tigers. Student Neil Carter on the trail: His cameras allowed remote monitoring of users of the path . So far, it appears tiger population numbers are . holding steady despite an increase in human population size. 'It's a very fundamental conflict over resources,' Carter said. 'Tigers . need resources, people need the same resources. If we operate under the . traditional wisdom that tigers only can survive with space dedicated . only for them, there would always be conflict. 'If your priority is . people, tigers lose out. If your priority is tigers, people lose out.' But he added: 'Conditions for tigers in Chitwan are good. 'Prey numbers . are high, forests outside the park are regenerating, and poaching of . tigers and their prey is relatively low. 'However, people of different . stripes, including tourists and local residents, frequent the forests of . Chitwan. 'Tigers need to use the same space as people if they are to . have a viable long-term future. What we're learning in Chitwan is that . tigers seem to be adapting to make it work. 'There appears to be a middle ground where you might actually be able to . protect the species at high densities and give people access to forest . goods they need to live. 'If that's the case, then this . can happen in other places, and the future of tigers is much brighter . than it would be otherwise.'","Tigers are active night and day - but appear to have changed patterns on Chitwan National Park, Nepal .

Far from sleeping on the job engineers at the Brick Lane based firm in east London will be asked to stay behind and sleep in the claustrophobic capsules to avoid the rush hour. And while other companies are set to offer staff the luxury of working from home during the Games the firm behind the capsules hope to get more workplaces on board. Podtime, the firm behind the unusual cabins, are billing them as the perfect solution to the Olympics' congested commute. On their official website they state 'London businesses will be severely affected by the transport . problems caused by the Olympics.

They drove the car on to the road and came alongside the man so PC White could speak to him through the car window. As the two officers were making notes of the answers to their questions, Neilson suddenly pointed a sawn-off shotgun at PC White, forcing him into the back of the car.

Shocking: Natasha Marie Harris, a mother-of-eight, died suddenly because she drank 18 pints of Coca-Cola a day for years, an inquest has been told . A mother-of-eight died suddenly because she drank 18 pints of Coca-Cola a day for years, an inquest has heard. Natasha Marie Harris would go 'crazy' if she ran out of the fizzy drink which she guzzled by the bottle. The 30 year-old died suddenly at her home in Invercargill on New Zealand's south island. Her partner, Christopher Hodgkinson claimed it was a result of drinking too much Coca-Cola. Yesterday he told the inquest that Miss Harris had been unwell leading up to her death and had no energy, but the idea Coca-Cola caused the problem had never crossed their minds. Mr Hodgkinson told the court that she had been unwell up to a year before her death, including vomiting six times a week, but they believed it was caused by the stress of looking after her eight children and gynecological problems. 'She drank at least 10 litres a day,' he said. 'As a family we wouldbuy four 2.5 litres a day, the maximum on special. 'The Coke would be for Natasha to consume over the course of the day. 'The first thing she would do in the morning was have a drink of Coke andthe last thing she would do in the day was have a drink of Coke by her bed.' Police who investigated the death, which happened on February 25, 2010, estimated she consumed, on average, seven litres a day. Her partner said she was addicted to Coke and without it she would getmoody, irritable and be low . Addicted: Natasha Marie Harris would go 'crazy' if she ran out of the fizzy drink . 'I didn't ever think about the Coke. I never considered it would do anyharm to a person. It's just a soft drink, just like drinking water. I didn'tthink a drink's going to kill you,' he said. She had been drinking a lot of Coca-Cola over the past seven or eight years,' he said. Vivien Hodgkinson, Mr Hodgkinson's mother, said she would go 'crazy' ifshe ran out of the drink. An autopsy showed Miss Harris had a diseased liver but the cause of death was undetermined. Her partner said he had been told she had a heart aneurysm caused by too much Coke. Medical evidence stated that the main finding of death was from a cardiacarrhythmia. Dr Dan Mornin told the court Miss Harris probably had severe hypokalemia, a lack of potassium in the blood, relating to excessive consumption of soft-drink. He said although it was difficult to confirm this from postmortem tests, itwas consistent with her symptoms of tiredness and lack of strength and other cases of heavy soft-drink consumers. He added it was likely the vomiting was due to too much caffeine, medicallyknown as caffeine toxicity. In June last year Coca-Cola confirmed it had hired a security firm to shadow its staff, after Mr Hodgkinson allegedly made death threats against the company. He rejected claims he had made the threats, but said he held the companyresponsible for Harris' death. Coca-Cola's New Zealand managing director George Adams said at the time that Hodgkinson's claims were 'patently untrue'.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 02:37 EST, 16 February 2012 . A grocer claims supermarket staff banned him from his local store after he bought vegetable oil to use as fuel in his vehicle. Chris Waites says managers at his local Tesco in Didcot, Oxfordshire, told him it was illegal for him to buy vegetable oil and use it as fuel in his delivery van. He claims the ban came after he purchased six five-litre bottles of vegetable oil to fill up the van he uses for his grocery business. Dispute: Supermarket bosses at the Didcot branch (pictured) said they were 'investigating' the matter . The transit van has been adapted to run on vegetable oil. It is not thought to be illegal to purchase vegetable oil to be used as bio fuel. Mr Waites said he clashed with staff at the store when he bought the bottles of oil and told them what he was using it for. Tesco said it was investigating the matter and stressed that it does not prevent customers from buying products. He said when he returned to the supermarket on Saturday to buy other items, he was told he was no longer welcome because using vegetable oil to run a vehicle was a criminal activity. He said: 'A member of staff told me in front of lots of other customers that I was no longer welcome at the store because I had been using vegetable oil illegally for my van. Criminal offence? The grocer claimed staff told him it was illegal to buy vegetable oil to use as fuel . 'Using vegetable oil to run a vehicle is not illegal and it was embarrassing to be branded a criminal in this way in front of lots of other shoppers. 'Normally we get given the vegetable oil free from pubs and restaurants but on this occasion I’d gone to Tesco. 'We deliver groceries to people in rural areas but I can’t imagine Tesco are trying to stop me from using my van because they feel threatened by the competition.' Mr Waites said he had been a customer at the store for seven years and he was not aware of any other reason why he was being banned. He added: 'The day before I bought the oil I went to customer services because the store had overcharged me for a pack of PG Tips. I got a refund but that was all sorted out and I can’t believe Tesco are being so petty.' Mr Waites, who lives with wife Miriam, 27, said his 2.5-litre Ford Transit van had been adapted to run on vegetable oil. He added: 'I have been running the van this way for about six years and it’s perfectly legal. The Government actually gives you a tax-free allowance every year if you use vegetable oil. We cover about 50 miles a day travelling around South Oxfordshire and use about 2,300 litres a year. 'A litre of diesel now costs over £1.40 at the pumps whereas a litre of vegetable oil costs about 90p.' In recent years companies have provided drivers with a source of greener, cheaper motoring by turning oil used for frying chips into biodiesel. After collecting drums of used oil from cafis and takeaways, firms refine the liquid into a fuel suitable for most diesel engines. But specially adapted engines, like the one in Mr Waites’s van, can run on unrefined vegetable oil. Biodiesel emits much less unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and other harmful substances, and does not produce the noxious black smoke associated with mineral diesel. However, biodiesel is not a lover of cold mornings and may cause start-up problems at very low temperatures. Tesco spokesman David Nieberg said: 'Our stores are there to serve customers, not prevent them from shopping. 'We’d like to stress we do not ban customers for simply buying vegetable oil – even if it is to put in a vehicle. We are speaking to Mr Waites to resolve the issue.'","Customer claimed he was banned from his local store .

Late night alcohol-fulled parties and skinny dipping in a canal are a few of the reasons Captain David Geisler was fired as a commodore in Bahrain last year, according to a new report. When he was sacked from his position in the 5th fleet, the U.S. Navy would only say that there was a 'loss of confidence' in his ability to command and that an investigation into 'alleged inappropriate conduct' was continuing. But now a report in the Navy Times has claimed that the commanding officer nicknamed 'Hoss' was at the centre of a several raucous parties. The investigation into Geisler's relief, was obtained by the paper via a Freedom of Information Act request. The main incident which led to Geisler, 45, being discharged from the U.S. Navy is alleged to have happened last June, after a full day of drinking at a glamorous apartment complex called the Floating City. The host, reportedly a junior officer, had just moved into the complex and threw a house-warming party, inviting a mix of colleagues from her command, friends and neighbours. She surprised her guests when she stripped off her bikini top, but was soon joined by another male and female who went skinny dipping with her in the canal. Witnesses said that was when Capt. David Geisler, the most senior officer at the party and commodore of the logistics task force responsible for supplying all naval assets in 5th Fleet, removed his bathing suit and swam naked in the water. According to investigators, the canal is in the middle of the luxurious complex, so their naked frolics were in 'plain view' of neighbors and people walking past on the street. Over the next five months, the junior officer's home became the location of many more parties - including fancy dress such as toga and wear-a-tie night. Party hub: The Floating City complex in Bahrain was the centre of raucous the parties. Last June after a full day of drinking witnesses said the commodore removed his bathing suit and swam nude in the water, with the topless party host . Fired: Capt. David Geisler, left, shakes hands with Capt. Donald Hodge after relieving him as Commander, Task Force (CTF) 53 at a ceremony at Sea Logistics Command Central Aviation Unit in Muharraq, Bahrain . At a lingerie party, where guests wore pajamas and silky lingerie, Geisler donned a bathrobe and what appeared to be either a swimsuit or boxers underneath - although one Marine at the party later remembered them as 'black silk shorts.' Damning find: The investigation into Geisler's relief, was obtained by Navy Times via a Freedom of Information Act request . On one occasion, . the party-goers jumped onboard a boat belonging to a Belgian couple who . lived in the complex, leaving a mess of drink stains, cigarette butts . and rubbish. 'We are in a region where our . behavior is repeatedly stressed to us from the minute we get off the . plane,' one officer, who left the party disgusted after seeing Geisler . swim naked, told investigators in a sworn statement. 'But . seeing these rules openly violated by the chain of command makes me . wonder how seriously it is taken,' he said reported the Navy Times. The parties did not slip completely . under the radar- neighbours, and other officers complained, saying such . behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the Islamic country. Geisler was at the centre of the parties - he . emailed junior officers from his government computer account to help arrange . parties and texted them on his official BlackBerry organsing to meet up at clubs . and bars. But Geisler's hedonistic lifestyle took a . toll on his reputation among other colleagues who did not attend the . parties, but heard the stories - officers began to feel that an . 'in-crowd' had formed around him and began to think he was only picking . his fellow party goers for trips abroad and awards. U.S. Navy Bahrain: Geisler's firing prompted major changes for the Navy in the country - 5th Fleet prohibited all drinking on- and off-base from midnight until 6 a.m., every day of the week . Staff who knew of the wild parties were too worried about their position if they reported Geisler’s indiscretions - it was made more tricky as one staff officer said that both the legal officer and the command’s equal opportunity manager frequently attended the parties. If he came forward, one officer . said, his expectation was: 'I will get crushed.' Once a complaint was finally made via . email to Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette, deputy commander of Naval Forces . Central Command, events changed very quickly. Five months after the skinny dipping . party,  Geisler was relieved in mid-October by Vice Adm. Mark Fox, 5th . Fleet commander, becoming the 19th of 22 COs fired in 2011. Unwelcome: Capt. David Geisler's behaviour in Bahrain, was not well received - neighbours, and other officers complained, saying such behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the Islamic country . Geisler received nonjudicial punishment for failure to obey regulations and for conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and three other officers were also reprimanded . Two weeks after his removal, the 5th Fleet prohibited all drinking on- and off-base from midnight until 6 a.m., every day of the week - the new rules includes bars, restaurants, and public spaces, tellingly including canals. The damage the parties and raucous behavior caused to relations in Bahrain is unclear. Fifth Fleet is 'unaware of any host-nation impact' from the indecent parties, Lt. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the fleet, said in an emailed reply to questions from the Navy Times. Geisler has been reassigned to Naval . Surface Force Atlantic in Norfolk, Va., according to Navy Personnel . Command. He did not respond to repeated calls and email requests for . comment.","Capt.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:10 EST, 11 October 2011 . Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Facebook unveiled a partnership on Tuesday to help the world's largest retailer connect customers with its local stores. Wal-Mart launched My Local Walmart, a page that lets the retailer's roughly nine million Facebook fans follow what is happening at stores in their neighborhoods. The effort covers about 3,500 Wal-Mart outlets and will send alerts to the company's Facebook fans about new products and discounts, the companies said. LIKE IT? Walmart launched 'My Local Walmart' with Facebook on Tuesday, hoping that new social networking push will help them reverse nine quarters of revenue declines . 'With early Walmarts, customers would walk in and ask the store manager to get a product,' said Stephen Quinn, chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart. 'This is going to allow this kind of communication at national scale. Stores become more relevant on a local level because of interaction with customers.' Wal-Mart is stepping up investments in both e-commerce and social networking to try to compete more effectively with Internet rivals led by Amazon.com. Facebook fans of Wal-Mart who sign up to the new page will get about two messages a week from their local store at first, Quinn added. Alerts may be triggered by local events such as a high school football game or weather, he said. 'A national message is sometimes not relevant,' Quinn said. 'We can now say we have sunscreen in the south and snow boots in the north.' My Local Walmart also will have a role in this year's holiday shopping season, especially on the day after Thanksgiving when shoppers line up early for deals, he added. Half of adults on Facebook currently follow a brand as part of their profile. WalMart has well over 9million followers . Shoppers will be able to download maps of their local store from My Local Walmart, showing them where specific merchandise will be in their store. 'It's impossible to put out a generic map,' Quinn said. 'This allows us to put out store maps for each local store.' WalMart hopes the push will help them compete with Amazon, run by CEO Jeff Bezos, this holiday season . The venture comes at a time when Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, is trying to reverse nine straight quarters of revenue declines at U.S. stores open at least a year -- a key measure of a retailer's health. Carolyn Everson, vice president of global marketing solutions for Facebook.com, said the partnership with Wal-Mart goes beyond a 'simple local tab.' 'This is embedding the social media phenomenon into the core of the offering,' she added. She noted that Wal-Mart has worked hard to engage its Facebook fans. Facebook isn't currently working with other merchants to develop this localized approach because it doesn't have enough resources, she added. In April 2010, Facebook allowed brands and retailers to use the now ubiquitous 'like' button on their websites, making it easier to share and connect with friends. Everson noted that brands are starting to see a measurable sales impact on products that are 'liked' on Facebook . More than 50 percent of active adults on Facebook follow a brand. To get local information from their store, Wal-Mart customers can click on to www.facebook/Walmart and then will be able to 'like' stores that are nearest to them.","Consumers can 'like' 3,500 individual WalMart stores .

A successful international lawyer who fondled a young woman who sat next to him has been put on the sex offenders register for the next five years and fined £3,500. Hugh Robert Wotherspoon, 54, was convicted of assaulting the woman by touching her in a sexual manner against her will after after Carlisle Crown Court heard how he had repeatedly touched his victims leg throughout the journey from Edinburgh. The married father-of-two from Carshalton, Surrey, admitted 'trying it on' because it felt natural to stroke her thigh after sitting next to her in cramped conditions for so long - but insisted he wasn't guilty because he believed the woman was enjoying it as much as he was. At a sentencing hearing on Friday Wotherspoon was also placed on probation supervision and ordered to attend a sexual behavior progamme. £1,000 of the fine will go to his victim as compensation. Wotherspoon - a qualified solicitor . who specialises in patent applications from his firm’s offices in . London, Munich and New York -  was arrested at Tebay Services on the M6 last August after the German-born woman told the driver she had been assaulted. During the trial the woman, who comes from London but can’t be named, said she was left 'shocked and shaken' by what happened. Scene: The assault took place on a National Express bus travelling south from Edinburgh . She said Wotherspoon, who had chosen to . sit beside her even though there were vacant seats when he got onto the . bus, first put his hand on her knee. She said that by the time the coach made its scheduled stop at Tebay, he had spent half an hour with his hand between her legs. She said: 'I was thinking of hitting him or screaming, but you never know how people will react.' In court his barrister Madeleine Wolfe said Wotherspoon admitted being 'an unconventional character'. Guilty: The 54-year-old from Carshalton, Surrey was convicted at Carlisle Crown Court . But she said: 'That does not make him any more dangerous than somebody more straightforward.' She said Wotherspoon had resigned from his highly-paid job following his conviction. He was also likely to be thrown out by the solicitors’ professional body. Ms Wolfe said he was 'not the sort of man who needs to be on the sex offenders’ register', but the judge disagreed. Judge Hughes said he found the case 'deeply troubling' and said he struggled to understand how such an intelligent man with his background could behave as he had done. He told Wotherspoon: 'You have brought disgrace upon yourself and have caused acute distress and embarrassment on your wife, your family.'","Hugh Robert Wotherspoon, 54, admitted touching his female victim during bus journey .

A former head of fraud and security at Lloyds has been charged with stealing almost £2.5million from the bank. Jessica Harper, 50, is accused of pocketing £2,463,750 by submitting false business invoices to claim payments. The senior manager at the Lloyds Banking Group, which is 40 per cent owned by taxpayers, was in charge of security at its digital section when the alleged scam took place. Harper, who earned around £70,000, is said to have submitted claims relating to the bank’s business, rather than to her personal expenses, during the height of the credit crunch and shortly after the bank was bailed out by the Government. But the alleged fraud between 2008 and 2011 was not uncovered until the bank carried out an internal investigation last year. She was arrested by detectives from Scotland Yard’s economic and specialist crime unit in December after the bank passed on its findings to police. Yesterday friends told of their shock after the Crown Prosecution Service decided to charge her with a single count of fraud. Jessica Harper is accused of carrying out the scam while working as head of fraud for digital banking at Lloyds Banking Group . Neighbours at her £450,000 semi-detached Edwardian home, which is situated in a leafy suburb in Croydon, South London, described her a keen charity worker and Rotarian. The divorcee, who separated from her husband John, 50, a number of years ago, has lived with her brother Gareth Tyrrell for years in the four bedroom property, although she also has a second property in France where her mother Helen lives. One of her other brothers, Matthew Tyrrell, runs a networking company working with stars in the music industry such as Bob Geldof, Paul Weller, Jim Kerr, Ed Sheeran and Rihanna. The Croydon home of Jessica Harper. Lloyds has refused to comment on today's charging decision against her . One of Harper’s neighbours, who did not want to be named, said: ‘She’s a nice person to have next door to you. She’s lovely. ‘She used to do loads of charity work and she was a member of the local Rotary club. I’d be shocked if she has done something like this as she’s just not that type of person.’ Another neighbour said Harper used to throw two parties a year and invite the whole street. He said: ‘She used to have a BBQ in the summer and a party at Christmas. But she isn’t a flashy person. I’d say she is very basic in her dress and she didn’t look like she really wore make-up.’ The house has recently been put up for sale. Harper has worked at Lloyds since 2000 but left several months ago. Sources described her as a middle manager who had only taken on the security and fraud position as an interim role. She had no access to customer accounts. On business networking site Linkedin, Harper said she was responsible for online technology development, delivery, text and email, security, fraud and internet operations. A former colleague posted a recommendation in 2007 saying: ‘Jessica is surely one of the most connected persons in the bank.’ Yesterday Andrew Penhale, of the Crown Prosecution Service central fraud group, confirmed the charge. Harper will appear before Westminster magistrates on Thursday.","Jessica Harper was arrested in December by detectives .

Angry: Ambulance driver Andy Thomson was fined and had three points put on his licence, after being caught driving at 84mph on the A1 in Scotland on his way to deliver a child's liver for an emergency transplant operation in Leeds . An ambulance driver has been fined and had points put on his licence - after speeding to save a child’s life. Andy Thomson was taking a child’s liver for an emergency transplant operation in Leeds when he was caught doing 84mph on the A1 in Scotland. The father-of-three had expected to be let off because of his job but he was given a £60 fine and three points on his licence. He had been driving a private ambulance - but, despite working for the NHS, he says police did not recognise his as an emergency vehicle. And now the driver has spoken of his outrage at the decision of Haddington Sheriff Court in East Lothian. Andy, 46, from Blyth, Northumberland, said: 'I think it’s an absolute disgrace. 'We’re now going to have to switch off our blue lights and go through that stretch at 70mph even if it is an emergency. 'That is going to cost somebody their life if there’s too much delay on one of these organs,' said Andy, who was driving a private ambulance for Lifeline Medical Transport Services. His journey took him to St James’s Hospital in Leeds just in time for a seriously ill child’s liver transplant to go ahead on October 8, 2011. 'At the end of the day, somebody’s life depends on this organ and for me to be delayed in anyway and for the hospital turn around and say ""sorry, you’re too late"", would be awful,' he said. 'At the end of the day, somebody’s life . depends on this organ and for me to be delayed in anyway and for the . hospital turn around and say ""sorry, you’re too late"", would be awful' - Andy Thomson, ambulance driver . The fine was the first time in Andy’s four-year career as a driver that he has been prosecuted for speeding. He said: 'Lifeline was contracted by the Freeman Hospital to carry out work for the NHS. 'I drive all over the country taking organs between hospitals and I’ve never once had a problem, apart from in East Lothian. 'Last March, I was on the very same road taking an organ and was clocked [at] 108mph and no action was taken against me, so I don’t know why police have decided to come down on me now.' After picking up the liver at Edinburgh’s Royal Hospital for Sick Children, cameras caught Andy at 7.06am on the southbound A1 at Gladsmuir. Lifeline disputed the fine and asked police for a Section 87 exemption for the offence - which the NHS Scottish Ambulance Service uses to avoid fees. But the company were told private ambulances don’t fall under Lothian and Borders Police’s definition of an emergency vehicle. Andy said: 'I was aware of the speed camera flashing as I passed but wasn’t really that concerned as I knew my speed was anything but excessive for what I was doing. Fined: Andy's company disputed the fine and asked police for an exemption for the offence - but were told private ambulances don't fall under Lothian and Borders Police's definition of an emergency vehicle . 'I’m really annoyed by how they apply the law so discriminately in Lothian and the Borders. 'It’s as if there’s one law for the Scottish Ambulance Service and another for us, yet we both work for the NHS. 'This ruling needs to change and be brought to the public’s attention, as it’s just wrong.' A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said: 'Lothian and Borders Police Road Policing Unit work closely with the NHS to establish the authenticity and credibility of any agency claiming to be carrying out work on their behalf when caught speeding.

A hospital trust at the centre of one of the worst NHS scandals is to be investigated by a hit squad amid fears over its dire financial state. As many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust between 2005 and 2009 due to poor care and medical errors. Now the independent regulator, Monitor, has announced it is stepping in because the trust is in financial crisis. Although standards are said to have substantially improved, there are concerns they may soon deteriorate again because of the trust's spiralling debts. Dogged by controversy: Financial experts are being called in to try and salvage Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stafford Hospital (pictured) With the result due next month, Monitor is now calling in firms offering financial . advice, accountancy, administrative and legal services to recommend how . the trust should run its services. Monitor said the move is aimed at protecting the health services for patients. The specialists will explore a number of options including hiving off services to private healthcare providers and they could even recommend that the trust is put into special administration. The experts, who will bid for the roles through a competitive tender, will start work shortly and will deliver a report by spring next year. It means Mid Staffs, which runs both Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals, could become the second NHS trust to be put into special administration. South London Healthcare Trust was put under the charge of a special administrator in June for being on the brink of bankruptcy. The trust, which runs three hospitals in the capital, was the first trust to be put on an 'unsustainable providers regime' because it was losing £1million a week. The findings of the inquiry into both the failings at Mid Staffs between 2005 and 2009 and the role of regulators will be delivered to the Government by chair Robert Francis QC in mid-October. In 2009, a highly critical report by the Healthcare Commission revealed a catalogue of failings at the trust and said appalling standards put patients at risk. Between 400 and 1,200 more people died than would have been expected in a three-year period from 2005 to 2008, the commission said. In February 2010, an independent inquiry into events at the trust found it had 'routinely neglected patients'. The trust is in danger of following the South London Healthcare Trust, which runs three hospitals including Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich (pictured) and was put under the charge of a special administrator for being on the brink of bankruptcy . Dr David Bennett, chair and interim chief executive of Monitor, said: 'We have been working closely with Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust to improve its performance. 'It has made significant improvements in the clinical care provided for patients, but we need to make sure these services can be secured in the long term. 'It is therefore time for us, as the sector regulator, to step in and look for a solution that ensures services are provided for local patients on a sustainable basis. 'We have an open mind about the form that solution might take, but it should be the best one for patients in the long term.' Lyn Hill-Tout, chief executive of the trust, said: 'We are hopeful that the outcome of this review by Monitor will be that decisions are made about which services are to be provided at Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals. 'Reviews of the trust over the last few years and the changes to the way healthcare has begun to be provided nationally have led to a growing feeling of uncertainty about the future of the two hospitals. 'We welcome Monitor working with our commissioners so that clear decisions are taken which ensure that the healthcare needs of local people are met in a truly sustainable way. We will, of course, give Monitor every support and will cooperate fully with their review team.' Foundation Trust Network director of strategy and communications Saffron Cordery said: 'The Foundation Trust Network supports all efforts to improve quality and sustainability of services for patients in Staffordshire and welcome this recognition of the value of resolving issues in the healthcare economy at a regional level. 'The health service continues to be under enormous financial pressure and many changes will have to be made - not just in Staffordshire. 'We need to find different ways of commissioning and delivering the services needed to deal with changing patterns of healthcare.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'Despite improvements, Mid Staffordshire is still facing serious financial challenges. 'This puts at risk its work on improving services for patients. It is important that valued local services are sustainable and able to continue providing high quality treatment and advice for patients. 'By starting to explore options with the trust and local NHS professionals now, Monitor is ensuring that there would be no delay if they need to take action next year to protect the local services that patients need and use.'","The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust is at the centre of an £11million inquiry .

A spy whose body was discovered in a padlocked bag was desperate to leave his intelligence post and complained about ‘friction’ at MI6 headquarters, his family said yesterday. They revealed 31-year-old Gareth Williams was a ‘scrupulous risk assessor’ and a meticulous genius who colleagues compared to a Swiss clock. But he had become disenchanted with a heavy drinking ‘office culture’, the London ‘rat race’ and work politics at the spy agency’s central Thames-side HQ. Family: Gareth Williams' sister Ceri Subbe, left, said the spy, right, disliked the office culture at the MI6 headquarters . At home: Inside the Pimlico flat where Mr Williams was found dead locked inside a North Face holdall in the bath . He applied to end his secondment early and return to the GCHQ Government listening station in Cheltenham, where he worked as a highly prized code-breaker. But just one week before he was due to leave, his naked and decomposing body was found in a large sports holdall in the bath of his home, sparking a huge police investigation. Yesterday, his grieving family attended the first day of a long-awaited inquest into his mysterious death. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox pledged to hold a ‘full and fearless’ inquiry as she heard: . Revelations about his personal life and claims that no third-party fingerprints or DNA were found in his home fuelled speculation around the circumstances of his death. His parents, Ian and Ellen Williams, listened as his sister Ceri Subbe told the inquest how he never spoke about his top-secret intelligence work. Choking with emotion, she outlined the astonishing academic achievements that led him to his highly specialist job and passions for sport, fashion and the arts. Mystery: Mr Williams was found dead locked . inside a holdall in the bath of his flat (above). his family want to . know why the alarm was not raised when he failed to turn up to work . Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox has said that . whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one . and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry' But Mrs Subbe said he disliked the office culture at the landmark MI6 headquarters on the south bank of the Thames. She said: ‘He missed the countryside and longed to ride his bicycle in the open air without smog and the constant fear of being run over by a bendy bus. ‘He disliked the office culture, post-work drinks, flash car competitions and the rat race. He even spoke of friction in the office. ‘The job was not quite what  he expected. He encountered more red tape than he was comfortable with.’ Mrs Subbe said she last spoke to her brother on August 13, when he said he was looking forward to going to see a transvestite comedian. Brilliant: Mr Williams, a mathematics prodigy and codes expert for GCHQ, had been on secondment with MI6 since March 2010 . She later found out he missed a meeting at MI6 that he was due to chair, but no one investigated why. On August 23 PC John Gallagher was asked to conduct a ‘welfare check’ on Mr Williams’s flat when he failed to keep in touch and they could not raise him. The officer described how the property was clean, tidy and unremarkable until he came across the holdall in the en-suite bathroom. PC Gallagher said: ‘I noticed that the side nearest the door had a round bulge. ‘I noticed there was a padlock with the two zips joined together. At this point I am realising it is something serious.’ He called Sergeant Paul Colgan, who used a knife to cut a three-inch hole in the bag, confirming a body was inside and alerting the murder squad. Sgt Colgan said the heavy-duty bag concealed the smell of the decomposing body but once the hole was made the ‘smell became more than apparent’. When Mr Williams’s sensitive job was discovered, detectives from the force’s Counter Terrorism Command were informed. The inquest, in Westminster, heard details of the spy’s life, including how he went to university aged just 16, joining the University of Bangor’s computer science department. It was also told how the successful cyclist and fell runner followed the arts and fashion and had a £20,000 collection of women’s designer clothing in his wardrobe.  Mrs Subbe said her brother was ‘the most scrupulous risk-assessor’ she had ever known. She said he would meticulously check his equipment before rock climbing, cycling and fell running. She added that her brother never told her he was being followed or felt threatened, saying: ‘I cannot think as to why anybody would want to harm him.’ The inquest, which is expected to last eight days, continues. Being tracked? Mr Williams is caught on CCTV in Holland Park on August 14, 2010, just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his Pimlico flat . Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence .

A sergeant described the moment he cut open the red North Face holdall and found the body of Mr Williams curled up inside.
A constable who discovered the bag and raised the alarm noticed underwear neatly folded on a nearby bed and a woman’s wig hanging on a chair. The death of Mr Williams in August 2010 triggered a painstaking investigation, worldwide media frenzy and a raft of conspiracy theories."

Five-year-old Zach Tahir suffers from a rare medical condition which means he's slowly eating his way through his bedroom. Zach has a constant need to chew, but as he can't distinguish between food and inedible objects he wants to eat everything from window blinds to the plaster on his walls. The youngster from Salford, Greater Manchester, who is autistic and cannot speak, has an extreme form of a disorder called Pica. Five-year-old Zach Tahir suffers from a rare condition which means he can't tell the difference between food and inedible objects . Some of the loose plaster in Zach's bedroom which the youngster has been eating . To keep him safe mother, Rachel Horn, has to go to extraordinary lengths ripping up celery to encourage him to eat it instead of thread and even sprinkling nuts on the carpet. Rachel has now launched a fundraising drive to build a 'safe room', without objects Zach could try to consume. Rachel, 32, said: 'He eats almost anything - mud and moss, stones, carpet, grow bags, thread, paper, wallpaper and hair. 'He loves to climb on his windowsill and eat his black-out blind. He likes to have something to chew on at all times. It is not the taste he likes, but the texture. 'It's frustrating as Zach doesn't speak - not one word - and meal times are a nightmare. He doesn't sleep much and I get exhausted, but unlike other autistic children he loves to give me hugs and he dances.' Zach, who lives with his mum and sister Isabella, two, was diagnosed with autism and learning difficulties aged three. His Pica, which is believed to be linked to autism, was diagnosed around the same time. Rachel first noticed her son wasn't developing at the rate of other children when he was nine months. She is hoping to raise £15,000 to make Zach's bedroom safe, furnishing it with items including a special mattress without seams. She has organised events including a sponsored walk in Buile Hill Park on June 3 and a car boot sale a week later. Caroline Hattersley, of The National Autistic Society, said: 'People with autism often experience sensory difficulties. 'For some individuals, the texture or taste of inedible items may give positive sensory input.' Pica is surprisingly common - although cases as extreme as Zach's are rare. Experts say as many as 21 per cent of children aged one to six can suffer it at some stage. Pica derives from the Latin for magpie - a bird with a reputation for eating almost everything. It appeared in medical texts as far back as 1563 and is believed to be common in pregnant women. In some cases, a lack of certain minerals - such as iron and zinc - may trigger the unusual cravings. The habit of eating non-edible objects could arise from some sort of deficiency. Some sufferers eat dirt, according to Dr Carol Cooper, and many of them are found to lack iron, which is present in soil. Others develop the condition because of extreme stress, though it is not clear why. A desire to eat cleaning agents may be linked with obsessive-compulsive disorder or just a liking for fragrances. Pica can lead to dangerous complications in the body's metabolism. One type of treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy with an experienced psychologist.

Gunned down: Devon Scarlett, 34, was chased into a dead end in Brixton, south London, and blasted twice at close range, it is claimed . A man was gunned down and beaten up as he lay dying from bullet wounds for 'disrespecting' a man he had never met before in McDonald’s, a court heard today. Devon Scarlett, 34, was chased into a dead end in Brixton, south London, and blasted twice at close range, it is claimed. He was then punched and kicked as he lay bleeding to death from bullet wounds to his thigh and stomach. Alleged gunman Horace Campbell, 27, told the victim: ‘You’re not so hot now’ before calmly walking away. Jurors heard that the dispute started at the end of a night out at around 6am on April 17 last year. Mr Scarlett, who also used the name Raymond Mitchell, entered the McDonalds in Brixton Road within minutes of Campbell, who had just left the Fridge bar. The pair squared up to each other after Mr Scarlett intervened in a loud argument between a group of men in the restaurant, it is claimed. Campbell then phoned 18 year-old Liam Douglas-O’Callaghan, who arrived minutes later with a loaded handgun, jurors were told. Witnesses saw all three man ‘wrestling’ in Marcus Garvey Way shortly before hearing shots fired. Row: The pair squared up to each other after Mr Scarlett intervened in a loud argument between a group of men in the McDonald's in Brixton, pictured, it is claimed . One neighbour woke up to hear a voice shouting ‘Shoot him, shoot him,’ while another heard the victim say: ‘Oh my God, he’s got a gun, he’s going to shoot me.’ Campbell was seen to pull out a gun and shoot Mr Scarlett at close range, it is claimed. Prosecutor Bobbie Cheema told the court: ‘Devon Scarlett remained on his feet at first but Liam O’Callaghan pushed him to the ground and punched him in the face. ‘Horace Campbell then kicked him while he was down on the ground. He then hit Devon Scarlett on the front of his head with the gun before both of these men left.’ Scene of death: Witnesses saw all three man 'wrestling' in Marcus Garvey Way, pictured, shortly before hearing shots fired - both Campbell and O'Callaghan now admit they were present at the scene but claim that Devon Scarlett had the gun . Neighbours came out of their homes to find the victim lying on the ground holding his stomach and saying: ‘He shot me.’ One bullet damaged the left femoral artery in his thigh near his groin and the other passed through his intestine. Mr Scarlett was taken to hospital for emergency surgery but died at 12.25pm. A carrier bag found in the road - said to be used to bring the gun to the scene - bore a fingerprint matching Douglas-O’Callaghan, jurors were told. Bad timing: Mr Scarlett,  left, who also used the name Raymond Mitchell, entered the McDonalds in Brixton Road within minutes of Campbell, who had just left the Fridge bar, right, which was nearby . Both Campbell and O’Callaghan now admit they were present at the scene but claim that Devon Scarlett had the gun. ‘They will assert that it was Devon Scarlett who tried to shoot the two defendants and while they struggled the shots missed them and hit him,’ said Miss Cheema. ‘Effectively “He shot himself” is what the defence will be.’ Miss Cheema added: ‘It is the prosecution case that Horace Campbell was determined to avenge the perceived lack of respect that Devon Scarlett showed him. ‘Devon Scarlett acted with foolish bravado, behaving like a tough guy, but whatever he said and did he was not armed. ‘He was the one who walked away, an unarmed man who had probably run all the way down that cul-de-sac when he saw that the gun had arrived.’ Campbell, of Anerley, southeast London, and Douglas-O’Callaghan, of Tulse Hill, southwest London, both deny murder. The trial continues.","Devon Scarlett was chased into a dead end in south London and blasted twice at close range, it is claimed .

But it was on one of these unremarkable taxi journeys that intrepid British trio Paul Archer, Leigh Purnell and Johno Ellison decided one of their next trips would be a record breaker. The three friends set themselves the daunting task of completing the world's longest, most expensive taxi journey, which would take them across the globe past some of the world's most iconic landmarks.

Now 15 months after setting off from London in their faithful £1,500 black diesel cab 'Hannah', the three university friends have triumphantly returned, having finished their record-breaking round the world trip and come back in one piece. The trio, friends from Birmingham's Aston University, have driven across 50 countries spanning four continents in a marathon adventure which clocked up an £80,000 cab fare. Along the way Paul, Leigh and Johno had to dig their 20-year-old K-reg cab out of an Arctic snowdrift, evade kidnapping in Pakistan and even scale the highest point ever reached by a taxi when they reached Mount Everest's base camp 5,300 metres above sea level. They also took in more conventional landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Sydney Opera House and the Taj Mahal.

Speaking at the finish line, Paul, from Stroud, Gloucs, said the journey had been emotional. He added: 'We’ve been utterly overwhelmed by the support we’ve been from everyone at home. 'We’re also grateful to the countless number of strangers we’ve encountered who’ve been kind enough to help us on our way.

A rise in sadistic murders and attacks on children accused of witchcraft by their families and loved-ones means police will now receive specialist training. The Met has admitted its officers are rarely able to spot the signs that a youngster is in danger despite dealing with 81 sorcery cases in the last decade. Its religious violence unit will now offer all staff training in a pilot scheme that could be rolled out across the country after a spate of high profile cases.

Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe, head of the Metropolitan Police's Religious Violence Unit, told the Independent: 'We're very well aware that usually the first person on scene is going to be the young cop with two or three years' service who probably has no understanding of this whatsoever. 'We're not naïve enough to think this is just happening in London. It is happening in Birmingham, it's happening in Leeds, Manchester and other big cities across the country.'

She was the woman whose own tragic childhood inspired her to create the world's most famous nanny. And now PL Travers' dramatic life and her long feud with Walt Disney over Mary Poppins, the 1964 film that catapulted her character to worldwide stardom is set to hit the big screen. Almost 50 years ago Walt Disney gave Julie Andrews her Hollywood debut as the magical nanny and Dick Van Dyke the chance to play one man band Bert, the Cockney with the questionable accent who befriends Poppins and the children in her care. But despite being one of the world's most loved movies Travers vowed never to work with Disney again because she was so appalled by it. Dramatic: PL Travers, pictured, and her siblings were left destitute when her alcoholic father died, inspiring her to create Mary Poppins . She hated the script, in . particular that it included the famous animated scenes and she considered that Andrews' Mary . Poppins was too pretty. Travers also disapproved of the film for ignoring . the harsher aspects of the nanny's character and did not like a . lot of the music. The new film Saving Mr Banks, starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, will centre around her dramatic journey to stardom and her lesser-known battle with icon Walt Disney. Born Helen Lyndon Goff in 1899, she suffered an impoverished childhood, which inspired her magical stories and characters. Her father was a banker who turned to alcohol, lost all his money and died young - it is widely considered that the character Mr Banks was based on him. As a young woman she was an actress, dancer and a poet before concentrating on fiction. Row: The 1964 movie is still loved all over the world but Travers never forgave Disney for what she thought was an appalling film . Anger: It was the animated scenes starring Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke that caused the author to cry throughout its premiere, which she had to sneak into . Ten years after leaving Australia for . Britain, with little money, her first Mary Poppins book was published . in 1934 with huge success. Under . her pen name PL Travers several other books were written but it was her . own personality and life that also fascinated people. She never married and as a single mother adopted an Irish child at 40, Camillus, but she refused to take her child's twin too. Meanwhile Walt Disney began a 14-year campaign to buy the rights to the Mary Poppins stories and make them into a film. Disney knew her books and bombarded Travers with 'attention, flattery, transcontinental telegrams and visits'. Hit: PL Travers, right, with Walt Disney, centre, and Julie Andrews, left, but despite the huge success of the film the author disliked it greatly and refused to work with Disney again . Success: Despite her tragic start in life Travers became an actress, pictured left in A Midsummer Night's Dream, and right in another play in her native Australia . Travers spent years rejecting attempts by Walt Disney . executives, who had spotted the film potential of the stories. After . refusing offers from most US film studios she finally gave in to Walt . Disney, accepting a $100,000 advance, around $2 million dollars today, . as well as five per cent of the film's profits and the chance to approve . the script personally. Bestseller: The author wrote eight books before she died aged 96, selling many copies across the world . But from there the relationship then turned sour. She constantly contacted the studio throughout filming with objections and attacked its producers and director. This culminated in her being . stopped from attending the film's premiere, but she managed to sneak in . and watched the film in floods of tears. She then refused ever to work with Disney on any other project, preventing them doing a sequel to the much-loved film. 'Julie Andrews, a friend of mine, has all . the necessary integrity to play the part – she was just directed . wrongly.' she said later. 'She was quite prepared to put on a . black wig, with a knob of hair at the back, and a turned-up nose. She's a . great trooper and very honest. But to her surprise, as well as mine, . Disney turned her into a very pretty girl, which really loses the . point.' Her experiences . with Walt Disney were so bruising that when the stage version was first . mooted she agreed on the proviso that 'no Americans' would be involved. She died aged 96 still upset about what had happened. The new film is expected to be released in 2014, fifty years after Mary Poppins hit the big screen.","Creator PL Travers never forgave Walt Disney because she was so appalled by the film that made her rich .

If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News. Heroine: Stephanie Decker threw herself on her two young children to save them from the tornado that flattened their home. She has recounted the fearful moments from her hospital bed . Knowing his mother was hurt, it was Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran to a neighbor's house. 'After Dominic left, I realised I couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said. One neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark County Sheriff’s officer, used his belt to create a tighter tourniquet and drove her until he could flag down an ambulance, which took her to hospital. Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him . Saved: Mrs Decker protected her two children, eight-year-old Dominic (L) and five-year-old Reese (R) Motherly: Mrs Decker, pictured with Dominic and her nephew, was saved when her son ran for help . Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home. His wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave here'. The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete. Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: ""You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up"".' The home, which was partly built by Mr Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field. Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said . Remaining strong: The children's hand prints can still be seen in the home's foundations . Henryville was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless. The Decker’s inspirational story is one of the few from that fateful day, which saw deaths in Alabama, Georgia.

Police say a Nebraska mom who disappeared last month with her son strangled the 10-year-old boy before strangling herself in the woods of an Iowa state park. Council Bluffs police said Monday that Charlotte Schilling, 41, of Plattsmouth  and her son, Owen, both died after being strangled with plastic cords in a murder-suicide. The Schillings were missing from May 10 until their bodies were found May 20 in Lake Manawa State Park, south of Council Bluffs in western Iowa, about 20 miles north of Plattsmouth. Gone: Charlotte Schilling, 41, checked her son Owen, 10, out of his elementary school on May 10 to go camping and had not been heard from since . Council Bluffs police say Charlotte Schilling tried to commit suicide with a plastic cord in November, but a family member intervened then. Police believe she strangled her son first and then herself with the cord. Council Bluffs Police Sargeant Chad Meyers said Schilling actually lost consciousness during her previous suicide attempt, and a family member heard her fall. Unusual: The night before she disappeared Charlotte told a neighbor she didn't feel well and had fallen and bumped her head. But her husband said nothing was out of the ordinary . That time, however, someone was able to cut the cord off Schilling's neck quickly enough for her to recover. Investigators said friends described behavior in the days before Schilling disappeared with her son as consistent with someone contemplating suicide. For instance, Mr Meyers said Schilling gave away some of her personal belongings. 'Individually, each one of these people probably wouldn't have known anything was different,' he said. 'When you put it all together and look at it, it paints a pretty clear picture of someone who is contemplating suicide.' The night before the woman and boy . went missing, another neighbor, Athena Meneses, said she spoke to . Schilling at a local Cub Scout meeting, where Meneses had taken her own . son and Owen. Owen had wanted to join the group, Meneses said. 'I . didn't really know her very well, but she seemed upset. She had a bump . on her head,"" Meneses said of Schilling. ""She didn't seem like she was . really happy that night. She said she wasn't feeling well and that she'd . like to go home. She told me that she had fallen down earlier that . day.' Relatives have said it wasn't unusual for Schilling to surprise her children with short road trips to parks, zoos and other nearby attractions. But the woman always called home and past excursions never lasted long. Her family grew worried when neither she nor Owen returned home, and Schilling's cellphone went unanswered. Happy: Carl schilling, left, with his wife Charlotte Schilling, centre, and their son Owen, right, in a family photo posted on Facebook in 2010 . Charlotte's daughter, Lindsay . Schilling, 20, said that is when she became concerned. 'I called until . her phone died - every minute,' she told KETV.com. 'The fact that she didn't pick up mine - that's when it hit me: there's something wrong right now.' Investigators believe the bodies of Charlotte and Owen Schilling had likely been lying in the woods near Lake Manawa since May 10 when Schilling checked Owen out of Wade Robin Elementary School in Bellevue, Neb. But police cannot determine the exact date of their death. Police found Schilling's vehicle at the park where the mother and son's bodies were later found. Schilling's cellphone and wallet were in her car, about a half-mile from where the bodies were found. Authorities had to rely on autopsy results to confirm the identities because of decomposition. Mystery: Police have not ruled out the possibility of a murder-suicide in the deaths of Charlotte Schilling, left, and her son Owen, right . Sunday night a passerby saw two decomposed bodies found at Lake Manawa State Park . After an autopsy officials confirmed on Tuesday that they were the mother and son . Schilling and her son were last seen in surveillance video from a convenience store near the park.

Manawa convenience store where surveillance video captured Schilling and . her son shortly after she checked him out of school, was one of the . last people to see them alive. Schilling bought a pack of cigarettes for herself, and apple juice and snacks for Owen. 'The . kid came in all hyper, like a normal kid would be, and went around . looking at stuff,' Johnson said. 'Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. They were just like any other mom and son. There was nothing that showed . me anything bad was going to happen.'

An image of a middle-aged cross-dresser is the first painting of its kind to be hung in the revered National Portrait Gallery. Painted in 1792 by Thomas Stewart it depicts Chevalier d’Eon, an eighteenth-century diplomat and celebrated British transvestite. French born d'Eton lived in London from 1762-1777 as a man, and from 1785-1810 as a woman. 'The patron saint of transvestites': Painted in 1792, the portrait depicts Britain¿s first celebrated male cross-dresser, Chevalier d'Eon . During both periods, he enjoyed considerable fame in international politics, high society and popular culture. No transvestite or transsexual, until . the late twentieth century has enjoyed such public recognition, . acceptance and popular affection. The portrait is seen as an . unprecedented historic document of his identity and acceptance into . British society at a time when men who were caught wearing women’s . clothing were viciously persecuted. Acquired by the gallery for £38,000 . the painting went on show for the first time yesterday following its . discovery by art historian Philip Mould. At a sale Mould attended in New York the painting was mistakenly labelled . as a portrait of an unknown woman by Gilbert Stuart, most famous for . painting George Washington on the dollar bill. Having brought it back to the UK it . was only when he set about cleaning it that Mould's suspicions about the . sex of the subject were aroused. Historic: The purchase of d'Eon's portrait marks an historic moment for the National Portrait Gallery . He noticed stubble on the woman's face and a muscularity, suggesting an unexplained masculinity. Speaking to The Guardian Mould said: 'Cleaning is always a revelation and on this occasion it revealed that not only was it in lovely condition but more pertinently, the Gilbert Stuart signature cleaned off revealing the name Thomas Stewart.' Further investigation by Mould resulted in the . identification of the sitter as Chevalier d'Eon, often referred to as 'the patron . saint of transvestites'. Although there are photographs in the . gallery's collection of Eddie Izzard and Grayson Perry they are not . dressed as women, meaning d'Eon's portrait is the first painting of a . cross-dresser to hang on the prestigious walls. Dr Lucy Peltz, Curator of Eighteenth . Century Portraits, at the National Portrait Gallery, says: ‘Chevalier . d’Eon was a figure of international fame and notoriety in the eighteenth . century, for his military, diplomatic and social exploits. 'But it is . his courage in following his gender orientation in the face of the . severest penalties that make this portrait one of the most  inspiring . and fascinating images’. Long before Chevalier lived publicly . as a woman he was feted as a soldier, champion fencer and diplomat who . helped negotiate the Peace of Paris in 1763, which ended the Seven Years . War. Notorious: Chevalier d'Eon enjoyed considerable fame as Britain's first celebrated cross-dresser . Having made England his home, he . refused to return to France when recalled, blackmailing the French crown . with threats to sell secrets to the British. Surprisingly London society accepted d'Eon as woman and he became well known for fencing demonstrations in theatres dressed in full drag. Despite his commitment d'Eon was not the most feminine tranvestite. As well as a noticeable six o'clock shadow he hitched his skirt when climbing the stairs and remained quite coarse and boorish. But this didn't stop pioneering feminists, such as Mary Robinson and Mary Wollstonecraft, championing d'Eon as a shining example of female fortitude. Interest in d’Eon has never waned with a new biography appearing approximately every 20 years between the 1830s and the 1950s. In 1928, Havelock Ellis coined the term ‘Eonism’ to describe transvestism and this remained in use until the 1960s. In the last 30 years, with the development of the academic discipline of Queer Studies research into d’Eon has never been more energetic. The Beaumont Society (which is named after the Chevalier d’Eon de Beaumont) was formed in 1966 to offer advice to the transgendered community. Today it is the largest and longest-established group to give support of this kind.","The portrait of a celebrated 18th century cross-dresser  went on show yesterday .

Hospital patients would be forgiven for expecting that the food dished up to them is prepared in only the most hygienic conditions. But kitchens making meals in British hospitals are failing to meet even basic standards of cleanliness, an investigation has found. And infestations of mice, rats and cockroaches have been reported in hospitals across the country, with a lack of training amongst catering staff also putting those in wards at risk. A number of hospitals have been plagued by cockroach infestations, putting vulnerable patients in danger . Health officers discovered that 541 out of 731 hospital kitchens were flouting hygiene regulations and found to be dirty. The results of the freedom of information request, reported in the Sun, show a number of incidents likely to worry hospital patients and their families. At Lewisham Hospital in South East London, environmental officers uncovered 'widespread mouse activity' and an infestation of cockroaches, whilst at Wolverhampton's West Park Hospital a dead rat was found in a cupboard in close proximity to where food was being prepared. Elsewhere, an officer inspecting Petersfield Hospital, Hants, was told that movement under the fryers in the kitchen was a result of 'a loose grape' not a mouse moving. As well as the disturbing reports of animal infestations, lapses in catering cleanliness are also leading to 300,000 infections a year, with out-of-date meals being served to patients in more than one in ten hospital kitchens. Christie's cancer hospital in Manchester had frozen food being stored five months after it should have been thrown away and at Sandwell General Hospital, West Bromwich, traces of listeria were found in patients' lunches. Patients at St Barts Hospital in London were served food from kitchens where mouse droppings were spotted . Lewisham Hospital in South East London where 'widespread mouse activity' was uncovered . The Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Kent, where mouldy chopping boards and dirty cutlery were spotted by inspectors . The shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has warned that the poor hygiene conditions are a result of the government concentrating its efforts on NHS reforms. Mr Burnham called on the Health Secretary to order an urgent investigations into the findings. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the poor hygiene conditions were a sign of hospitals struggling to cope . He told the Sun: 'Hospitals are struggling to cope as the Government wastes billions on a back-office reshuffle. 'On their watch, situations have developed below deck.' Environmental inspectors also found that even the most primitive efforts at ensuring hygiene are not being put into place. At South East London's Queen Mary's, Sidcup, cutlery was put away whilst still dirty and chopping boards used for preparing food were discovered to be mouldy. Catering staff at Rochdale Infirmary also served up warm vacuum-packed sandwiches to patients. A health watchdog group has condemned the findings as 'outrageous'. Roger Goss, co-director of health watchdog Patient Concern, speaking to the Sun, said: 'If these were restaurants they would be put out of business and the owners would be put in court.' The findings come after a hospital campaign to ensure that more staff washed their hands regularly was hailed as a success that has saved up to 10,000 lives. The high-profile Clean Your Hands campaign to encourage doctors and nurses to use soap and water or alcohol gel between patients has saved more lives than any medical development for a generation, according to the report published in the British Medical Journal today. Following the launch of the drive in 2004, the amount of soap and alcoholic hand rub bought by NHS trusts almost tripled. Over the same period of time MRSA rates in hospitals fell by more than half, while there was a significant drop in the number of Clostridium difficile infections. Rats have been spotted at a number of hospitals - including one rotting in a cupboard at Wolverhampton's West Park Hospital . Traces of Listeria bacteria, which can cause meningitis and septicemia, were found in hospital sandwiches . Sheldon Paul Stone who led the study, estimated that around 10,000 lives were saved because of the campaign which encouraged medical staff to take the simple step of washing their hands. The study also found that hospital trust procurement of soap and alcohol hand rub rose from a combined 21.8ml to 59.8ml per patient bed day over the period. Studies in 2004 showed one in four doctors and nurses in Britain still did not wash their hands reliably between every patient. Warm vacuum-packed sandwiches were dished up to patients at Rochdale Infirmary in Greater Manchester . The campaign which ended in 2010 cost £500,000 over four years. Researchers from University College London Medical School and the Health Protection Agency say 'strong and independent associations' between the rise in soap orders and the fall in infection rates ‘remained after taking account of all other interventions’. The number of MRSA infections fell to 1,114 for the period 2011-12.","300,000 hospital infections a year being caused by poor hygiene conditions .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:48 EST, 6 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:22 EST, 6 June 2012 . Americans are in for a cyber-surprise on Wednesday: They'll be able to plug family names into an online 1940 U.S. census and come up with details about the lives of New Yorkers - from Joe DiMaggio and Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy to their own relatives. Starting after midnight, it will no longer be essential to provide exact addresses from seven decades ago to look for a New York connection. With names, free searches of the 1940 U.S. census first made public in April will unlock personal information about residents of New York - then the largest U.S. state and an immigrant hub from which people moved all over the country. Famous residents: One entry in the 1940 census is for George 'Babe' Ruth, shown eighth from the bottom on the left hand side; he is one of many notable New Yorkers who are searchable online now . New York's young: Left, a young Jackie Bouvier watches a horse race in 1939; and right, pictured in 1960 as Jackie Kennedy; the Bouvier's records and many more are now searchable online . Censused: This U.S. Census ledger page shows an entry for Jacqueline Bouvier, second from top . Maiden name: Jacqueline Bouvier, who became Jacqueline Kennedy when she married John F. Kennedy . Census experts say the New York data is of national interest because tens of millions of Americans have roots in this gateway to the United States through Ellis Island, and many can now dig for more personal information. 'That's the exciting aspect about this - the ability to search the lifetime of our mothers and fathers,' said Debra Braverman, a New York-based independent forensic genealogist with clients seeking information for trust funds and estates. When the census was first released, 'if you didn't know exactly where someone lived in 1940, you couldn't find them,' Ms Braverman told the AP. Indexing by name is crucial to cracking the until-now closed book of that year's census, which by law could not be released for 72 years and is therefore the most recently available one. This U.S. census leads to China. Helping Uncle Sam: A poster advertises the 1940 census telling Americans of the importance in participating in the 'ten-year roll call' Taking down numbers: An enumerator interviews a woman for the 1940 Census; the 1940 U.S. Census plus the 1915 and 1925 New York Censuses are now searchable online by family name, without needing often forgotten addresses from seven decades ago . Some of the work of transcribing handwritten census records into a computerized index was done by workers in an office outside the southern city of Dongguan with 'very strong character recognition abilities,' said Todd Jensen, who heads the document preservation service at Ancestry.com, a Provo, Utah-based family history company that's releasing the online New York census for 1940 using their new name index. 'Given the complexity of their own language, reading and recognizing characters from other languages comes easier,' he said. Also Wednesday, another historic treasure trove appears on the Internet for the first time: census information compiled separately by New York state for 1915 and 1925, indexed by name. These records include details about famed personalities such as Lauren Bacall, Al Capone, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Houdini, who according to the 1925 census was born in the United States, even though most biographies say he was born in Hungary. The interest in roots is so intense that 37 million hits temporarily crashed the National Archives provider site when the 1940 census was released on April 2. Many who logged on hoping for results hit the wall, frustrated for lack of specific locations required for results. A different era: In 1940, the U.S. was still recovering from the Great Depression and entered WWII a year later . Political prowess: Other data includes the 1925 census data for former New York City mayor Ed Koch, appearing at the top of the page at right . The athlete and the wordsmith: Joe DiMagio, left, and author J.D. Salinger, right, were in the city at the time of the census . Ms Braverman, a Manhattan resident, uncovered details about her 84-year-old father's family because he remembered his family's Brooklyn address before his bar mitzvah in 1940, when he was 13. 'His memory was spot on,' his daughter said. But the Brooklyn childhood address her mother remembered didn't match, so they will try to find the information again this week. Former New York Mayor Ed Koch hit the jackpot when it came to his family history, which is contained in all three censuses - the federal one, as well as the New York ones from 1915 and 1925. The 87-year-old Koch participated in a preview search conducted by Ancestry.com, which is making all three census records available online. His said his father came from Europe, alone at age 16, eventually raising a family in a Bronx apartment. For years, 'I told people that we lived in abject poverty,' he said. A series of census records from the time would prove him wrong. Notable New Yorkers: Jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald, left, and actress Katharine Hepburn, right, lived in New York at the time of the 1940 census . The times are a-changing: Hundreds of New Yorkers are seen swarming Times Square in 1940 . They showed that the Depression-era . rent for the Kochs' five-room Bronx apartment was $75 a month, 'and that . was a lot of money at the time,' Koch said. 'All . my life, I was telling people I was very poor, but I learned we did not . live in abject poverty; I was born into a middle-class family,' he . said. The New York world of . the 1940 census includes names that later became famous, including . Katharine Hepburn, John D. Rockefeller Jr., J.D. Salinger, Kennedy and . Ella Fitzgerald. The 1940 census by name index will be available for all states possibly as early as this fall. While . New York is the biggest state whose census records are already . name-indexed, a number of smaller states also have been made . name-accessible by Ancestry.com and two other companies, . FamilySearch.org and MyHeritage.com. New . York state censuses for 1915 and 1925 are available online for the . first time via a link that says 'find family history for free' to anyone . providing a New York ZIP code and email address. The state censuses show 'every New Yorker from the famous to the infamous to everybody in between,' said Kathleen Roe, director of archives and records management at the New York State Archives. A perfect example of this melting pot is Babe Ruth, who at 17 appeared in the 1925 census as 'George H. Ruth,' living by the Grand Concourse near Yankee Stadium, which would later be dubbed 'The House That Ruth Built.' Family ties: Independent forensic genealogist Debra Braverman located her family's data in the 1940 census data earlier this year when her now 84-year-old father remembered his 1940 street address; now, they can search only by name . Digital era: After midnight Wednesday, Americans will be able to plug family names into an online 1940 U.S. census and come up with details about the lives of New Yorkers . The Ruth family neighbour was Joseph Weinstock, an Austrian immigrant working in manufacturing and his Russian-born wife, the census shows. 'So here was the future American baseball hero living next door to an immigrant family making it in the United States,' Roe said. 'What a great American story! And that's what you can find out walking through a neighbourhood with census records.' The censuses released this week offer 'one of the greatest collections of historic voices you'll ever find,' said Roe, adding that if read together, they trace whole families as they move around. The census data also include such information as occupation, whether immigrants were naturalized citizens, and whether they owned or rented their homes - in other words, sketches of communities, said David M. Kleiman, president of Heritage Muse Inc., a New York-based genealogy technology firm. 'What we're all looking for is the story of the family - what made my grandparents the way they were, which made my parents the way they were, which made me what I am,' he said.","1940 census completely digitalised and is now searchable by family name .

A sky-diving pensioner, who became an internet sensation after a video was posted of her seemingly refuse to get out the plane then dangerously hanging from the instructor when the dive went horribly wrong, has said she DID want to jump. In the incredible Youtube video, 81-year-old Laverne Everett looks like she is clinging onto the plane’s door as if she changed her mind about the jump at the last minute. However the thrill seeker has spoken out to say that she wasn’t forced out of the plane – as the footage appears to show but that her her knees gave way. Scroll down for videos .

Daredevil: Laverne Everett, 81, has spoken out insisting that she did want to jump out the plane - in the video she appears to have been pushed . 'No, I don’t look at it that way,' said Laverne when asked if she was pushed out the aircraft. '[The instructor] knew how bad I wanted to jump.' Laverne, who admits to seeking out excitement, surprised her family when she announced that she wanted to jump out of a plane to celebrate entering her ninth decade. 'They thought I was very brave,' Laverne, from Oakdale, California, told CBS. 'But, it’s just something I’ve wanted to do for a long time.' And she fulfilled her wish at the Sky Dive Lodi Parachute Center last May. However the dive itself, which was all caught on camera then posted on Youtube by Laverne's sister, did not go as smoothly as expected. After her harness came loose Laverne was left precariously dangling from her instructor as she hurtled towards the ground at 125mph. Furthermore, the daredevil could not see what was happening as her shirt flew up covering her face. 'The upper harness came off, you know. Just slipped down, it was just the lower harness, is all I had.' High spirits: Laverne, 80, the tandem skydiver, said it was her first ever jump as she is filmed before take-off. She said she had been planning the leap for a decade . Smiling: Laverne looks at the camera as the plane makes it ascent in preparation for the jump . In the dramatic video, which has been seen more than 92,000 times on Youtube, the woman's tandem diver can be seen clinging onto her safety harness which had slipped down her legs during the jump in California. As they plummet towards the ground, the woman's top flies up exposing her back to the high-speed winds. The cameraman - a separate jumper filming the whole experience - comes over to help as the pair get into difficulties. Just before the jump happened, the woman appears to yell 'no!' - telling her instructor to stop her getting out of the aircraft. Struggle: After making the ascent, the woman apparently decided she did not want to make the jump which she had been planning for the last decade . Jump: With the woman appearing to resist, she plunges out of the plane. A British Parachute expert said the problems started because they were in the wrong position when they left the aircraft . It was her first skydive, which she had been planning for a decade, she says on the video which was published on TheChive.com. 'She was very close to slipping out,' he said. 'You can see from the video the instructor was trying to get to the harness and cling on to it. The person with the video camera was also trying to help.' The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is now investigating what went wrong with the dive.

A suspicious girlfriend's plot to catch out her lover backfired spectacularly when the honeytrap she hired ended up running off with him herself. Samantha Phipps, 26, decided to test Jack Ewing's loyalty after finding a sexy text from another woman on his phone. She spent £200 on the services of a 'Miss Honeytrap' and arranged for her to meet her boyfriend in the pub. Heartbroken:Samantha Phipps, 27, pictured left, hired honeytrap investigator Jane Gill (right) to check whether her partner Jack Ewing was cheating on her. Miss Gill then ran off with him . The plan was to see if the undercover female could entice Mr Ewing, 32, into a sexual encounter and then arrange for the pair to meet another time, at which point Samantha would confront him. Unfortunately for Samantha, the tryst last November was a success as the honeytrap informed her that they had kissed and planned to meet at a hotel a few days later. 'She gave me all the details of where they’d be meeting and asked if I wanted to go' said Samantha, an administrator from Bristol. 'I was heartbroken. He’d fallen for her so easily, but of course I said yes.' Mr Ewing - who started going out with Samantha in January last year - left the home the couple shared the following day and didn't come back for the whole weekend. Samantha sent him a text pleading with him to respond and he replied with: 'I've gone and I'm not coming back'. She turned up at the hotel on the day when Mr Ewing was supposed to be meeting the honeytrap, but he wasn't there. Samantha spent the rest of the week crying before eventually going out on a Friday night to drown her sorrows. In happier times: Samantha Phipps with her then boyfriend Jack Ewing . Painful: Samantha caught the woman and her boyfriend in a bar and flung a drink over her .

Mr Ewing, who has since moved out of the couple's home, said he feels 'quite good about what happened', adding: 'I’m happy with Jane.'

"By . Liz Thomas and Louise Eccles . UPDATED: . 20:10 EST, 25 January 2012 . Baby ban: The 2012 organisers have said every child, including babes-in-arms, must have their own ticket . Mothers could be allowed to take their babies to the Olympics after organisers signalled they would reverse a controversial policy effectively banning newborns. Thousands of parents had complained about a rule stating that every child – including babes in arms – must have their own ticket. With 16 months between the first wave of ticket sales in April last year and the start of the Games, many ticket holders have welcomed additions to their families. But they were told they would not be able to simply bring their babies along – even though the infant would not be using a seat. Even if parents subsequently attempted to buy a ticket for their child, there would be little point as the seats would not be together. Yesterday, however, Labour’s Olympics spokesman Tessa Jowell – who sits on the board of organisers Locog – pledged that the committee was ‘trying to find a solution’ to ensure families and mothers with new babies could still attend events. The Olympic stadium in east London. A spokesman admitted the Olympics helpline had received calls from pregnant women and expectant fathers whose babies will just be a few weeks old when the Games commence . ‘What seems to have happened is that . mums have had babies since they bought their tickets and have been led . to understand that they would have to buy a ticket for their little . baby,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s World at One. ‘I talked to Locog about this. This is . a problem that they intend to solve so that wherever it is conceivably . possible, little babies will go to the Games with their mums. This is an . expression of our determination that this is a real family Games. Computer hackers will try to inflict havoc on the Olympics by attacking the official Games websites and those of its major sponsors, the Home Secretary warned yesterday. Theresa May predicted the threat level for a terrorist attack on London 2012 will be ‘severe’ – meaning a plot is ‘highly likely’. She said in addition to physical attacks, there was ‘a strong possibility’ of a ‘threat from cyber-crime’. Malicious computer experts – known as ‘hacktivists’ – could target the security and ticket systems, she warned. ‘We are aware of the threat from so called “hacktivist” groups,’ Mrs May said. ‘These groups may attempt to target the Games and may also attack the websites of high-profile sponsors associated with the Games.’ ‘They are on this problem now and . looking to solve it now. They will be in touch with everybody who this . might apply to as soon as they can be.’ Miss Jowell conceded it may not be . possible to bring small children to all events. But she insisted that . Locog was ‘focused on finding a solution’ to the problem immediately . rather than in April, when a fresh wave of ticket sales begins. The suggestion of a U-turn comes as . the independent Equality and Human Rights Commission warned that new . parents who wanted to take their babies to the Games could have a case . for sex discrimination if they were prevented – because the rules were . likely to affect more women than men. Since news of the ticket policy . emerged, many parents have told on social networking and parenting . websites of their misery at being unable to attend events. The problem particularly affects those . who live outside London and the South East, where a visit could . potentially involve an overnight trip, making childcare difficult. One mother said: ‘I live in Shropshire and had planned to go with my two children and husband. ‘I have fallen pregnant since I bought . the tickets but as I want to breast-feed – unless I can bring the baby . we just won’t be able to go. It’s ridiculous.’ At Lord’s cricket matches, babies and toddlers under three go in for free, while Wimbledon recommends babies are not taken. Children under five are allowed in without a ticket – but may not enter Centre Court or the other show courts. At Twickenham Stadium, children under . two do not require a ticket but must be securely strapped to an adult . sitting in the lower tier of the stands. One woman on Mumsnet said she is likely to miss out on the Olympics as a result of the policy. She said 'it does feel like discrimination', adding she has four tickets for sailing. 'We will apparently need another ticket for a baby not even born yet and certainly not conceived when we bid for tickets.' She said she would bid for another ticket but did not hold out much hope. 'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I. Outrage on Mumsnet: 'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I' 'I normally keep well clear from the . breast v bottle discussions, but this does feel like discrimination . against those people who are breastfeeding. 'And those unable/unwilling to leave a very small baby in the care of someone else.' Another woman said she objected to the . fact that she needed 'to get another ticket that in all probability . won't exist... Stopping me and potentially my family from going. 'It . will be a while until I know if I can even get another ticket (April, . provided the website is working by then), regardless of the cost, and . probably too late by then to be able to re-sell any tickets we are . subsequently unable to use.' Another 'fuming' pregnant woman wrote on Mumsnet: 'I’m shocked by the conversation I just had with the London 2012 ticketing people. 'My . husband and I were lucky enough to get tickets to the horse jumping in . August. Our baby is due 2 June, so was inquiring about what I need to do . about tickets for the new baby. 'They said everyone needs a ticket - fine. Children’s tickets are £1 - fine. 'But there are no children’s tickets for the horse jumping so I have to pay £95 to have a three-month-old in a sling! 'They said the only alternative was to re-sell my ticket or give it to someone else.' Anyone wishing to re-sell their tickets must submit their request to Olympic organisers by a February 3 deadline. A second wave of ticket re-sales will occur in April.

"By . Chris Hanlon . PUBLISHED: . 07:58 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:31 EST, 1 May 2012 . US fighter pilots have asked not to fly the military's 190 F-22 Raptors because of oxygen problems with the $143million (£88m) stealth fighter, an Air Force leader has revealed. Gen. Mike Hostage, commander of Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia, told reporters that a 'very small' number of pilots have asked not to fly the fifth-generation fighter jets or to be reassigned. 'Obviously it's a very sensitive thing because we are trying to ensure that the community fully understands all that we're doing to try to get to a solution,' Hostage said. Air attack: Pilots have asked not to the fly the latest F-22 model because of fears of blacking out over lack of oxygen despite it being one of world's most advanced . Top speed: Above mach 2 with afterburners: greater than 1,317mph (2,120km/h). Kill ratio: F-22 pilots demonstrated that its higher cruise altitude has given it a major combat advantage over US 4th/4.5th generation fighters and have an unblemished kill ratio against other . US fighters in training maneuvers. Problems: The oxygen system was suspected as being behind a crash in which an F-22 pilot was killed in November 2010. Overview: The F-22 Raptor is primarily an air-superiority fighter but is also capable of ground attack and electronic warfare, and signals intelligence roles. Despite a costly development period, the United States Air Force considers the F-22 the key component of US air power, and claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter. However its high cost, lack of clear air-to-air combat missions because of delays in the Russian and Chinese fifth-generation fighter programs  resulted in calls to end production. The final F-22 of 187 came off the assembly line on 13 December 2011 during a ceremony at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. He would not provide exact figures on the number of pilots who have asked not to fly the jets and said each pilot's request would be handled individually. Air Force officials insist the airplane is safe to fly - Hostage noted that he'll fly soon because he won't ask a pilot to do something that he will not. 'I'm going to check out and fly the airplane so I can understand exactly what it is they're dealing with. 'The day we figure out what the problem is I will stop flying (the plane) because we don't have enough sorties for all of our combat aviators to get as much training as they need,' he said. The nation's F-22 fighter jets were grounded for four months last year after pilots complained of experiencing a lack of oxygen that can cause dizziness and blackouts. Air Force officials said they have taken steps against the problem, but still haven't pinpointed what's causing the hypoxia -  when the body doesn't receive enough oxygen. Stealth: Iran has complained about the fighters being stationed in the Middle East . An Air Force panel is meeting weekly to investigate the problem and has enlisted the help of NASA and the Navy to learn more about what happens to the body under extreme conditions. Hostage spoke during a media day event at the base, highlighting the nation's most advanced fighter plane. After being introduced in 2005, the last of nearly 190 jets are scheduled to be delivered to the Air Force this week. At a price tag of $143 million each, the Raptor has come under some criticism for not being used in place of older and less-sophisticated jets in Iraq or Afghanistan. Hostage said the plane is critical to maintaining the nation's air superiority in the future and that he wishes he had more of the jets at his disposal. On Monday, Iran's defense minister said that reports of the stealth fighter jet being deployed to the United Arab Emirates would damage regional security, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported. Without saying which country in the region the F-22s were deployed to - or which base or bases they were deployed from - Hostage said there's a reason other nations take note of the plane's movements. 'People pay attention to where this airplane goes and what it does because, regardless of the furore in our press and public about the suitability or the safety of the airplane, they're very worried about its capability.' he said. The planes are stationed at five other bases besides Virginia: Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska; Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii; Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada; Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico; and Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.","Military has almost 190 of the craft, classed as the most advanced at the country's disposal .

The bank's cash machines, branches, debit cards, and internet banking services all stopped working at 2.45pm after a computer glitch. The outage lasted more than two hours, with frantic HSBC staff finally finding a fix at 4.50pm. Earlier, a Twitter storm erupted with worried customers saying they could not withdraw money from HSBC cash machines and their cards had been declined in shops. When This is Money rang the call centre it was engaged and both HSBC and First Direct internet banking was unavailable.First Direct said its systems came back online at 16.40 - some two hours after the problem hit. HSBC customers were locked out until 16.53, when cards and internet banking were switched back on. On its Twitter feed, the bank said: 'Card terminals and internet banking should now be back on.

In a statement, the bank had said: 'We are aware of some problems and are looking into them as a matter of priority.' Hundreds of HSBC customers took to Twitter to complain about the problems . Helen Dadd, 23, an HSBC customer from . Birkenhead, said: 'I went out and tried three cash machines and none . would let me draw my money out. 'I went to the bank and asked if it was my personal account or if it was the system and they said their system was down. 'They didn't say when it would be up.

In the banks, tellers appeared . confused about what was going on. At 2.55pm, an HSBC employee in the . Kensington High Street branch, in London, said that the whole system was . down and had been for about 20 minutes. She suggested that it might take . another 20 minutes to get the system up and running. But it seemed clear . that the bank did not know what the problem was or how to solve it. 'I expect the lights to go out next,' she remarked before advising getting money out at the cashiers. Many took to Twitter to voice their disappointment.

Carnage: Pakistani security officials examine the wreckage of the destroyed bus on the outskirts of Peshawar . No group has claimed responsibility for the atrocity, although the Pakistan Taliban and its network of militants have carried out similar bombings in the past. The bus was filled with commuting government employees when the bomb was detonated. Mohammed Javed, 35, who was on board, said he was covered in the blood of other victims. Speaking as he was treated at a local hospital, Mr Javed added: 'Luckily I was in the front part of the bus, and the bomb went off in the back. Agony: A relative of one of the victims mourns at the scene of the explosion . Treatment: Medics attend to the injured at a local hospital. Rescuers fear the death toll will rise . 'Something hit me in the shoulder, but I kept my senses and started helping badly hurt people.' Witnesses said they saw body parts scattered around the smouldering wreck of the bus. Jalal Khan, 14, was standing in the aisle of the crowded bus when the bomb went off, and his right arm was slashed by a piece of metal.

The victim of a vicious kidnapping and torture is speaking out for the first time about the ordeal, revealing his struggle as he was handcuffed and beaten for hours over the weekend. Police say that Thomas Chapman’s six roommates turned on him on Saturday evening, torturing him in the basement of their Magna, Utah, home, binding his feet, stapling his lips shut and jabbing at his chest with a power tool. Speaking to KSL TV today, Chapman chronicled the agonising hours, saying he was punched and kicked by his attackers, but that was only the beginning. Scroll down for video . Brutality: Thomas Chapman said he was viciously beaten by his six roommates, had his lips stapled and was cut with a power tool during the assault, which lasted hours . Wounds: Chapman shows where his assailants poked at him with a drill . He told the station: 'They put my hands behind my back and stuff and handcuffed me with my own handcuffs. 'Next thing I know I’m getting beat up with my laptop, keyboards, boards, sticks, having knives put to my throat, getting kicked in the ribs, getting kicked in the head.' Chapman also had his lips, ears and chest stapled and his assailants poked at him with a Dremel drill, all while he was held at gunpoint. Jennifer Moses, 30, Lee Carl Moses, 26, David Masters, 55, Paula Masters, 43,  Brandon Haggard, 20 and 45-year-old Tracy Jordan allegedly kidnapped the man late on Saturday evening. Vicious: Jennifer Moses, 30, (pictured left) and Paula Masters, 43, were part of the gang who allegedly inflicted stapled wounds and used a power tool on Thomas Chapman in Utah . The suspects were reportedly suspicious about Chapman, 41, who only moved into the house in Magna, near Salt Lake City, 11 days ago. The roommates struck him multiple times with objects including a crutch, keyboard, laptop and the butt of a shotgun. Unified Police Lt. Justin Hoyal said : 'All night they tortured him. One of the suspect's claims over the last several weeks different people have pulled a gun on him in the street. They believe [the victim] was responsible for it.' The group decided at 4am on Sunday that the roommate might not have been behind the threats and apologised before letting him go, Officer Hoyal said. Fear: David Masters and Tracy Jordan were being held at a Utah prison after kidnapping and torturing their roommate . Sickening: Brandon Haggard (left) and Lee Moses lived at the same home in Magna, near Salt Lake City where they allegedly conspired to torture their roommate . They released Chapman, who fled to a relative's home wearing only underpants and was taken to a hospital. He remains in a stable but serious condition after his ordeal. The six were booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on charges of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault and obstruction of justice. Records showed all suspects remained in custody today. It was unclear whether they have attorneys. Chapman had agreed to remodel the basement instead of paying rent at the shared home. The relationship between those living at the residence was unclear.

A violent thug who kicked his lover's five-year-old son to death because he was jealous of the attention the little boy received was yesterday found guilty of murder. Tyler Whelan died in hospital after suffering blunt traumas to the head and abdomen at his home. The youngster was left alone at home with his mother's abusive boyfriend Elvis Lee, 34, who admitted the manslaughter of Tyler but denied murder. Tragedy: Tyler Whelan, five, died after being savagely attacked by his mother's boyfriend because he was jealous of attention the child received . Unemployed Lee, of Peterborough, Cambs, admitted kicking the little boy in the stomach and biting his leg in March, 2011, but denied killing him. He was found guilty of murder by a jury following the three-week trial. Stephanie Whelan, 27, was found guilty of causing or allowing his death. Both defendants were cleared of allegations of cruelty to the tragic youngster. Tyler had been admitted to hospital ion several occasions before his death. During the trial Cambridge Crown Court was told Lee wanted to harm Tyler because he had interrupted his sleep, or because he was jealous of the attention he received. Tyler was confirmed dead at 11.25am in Peterborough City Hospital on March 7, 2011, after the incident at Lee's three bedroom house in Crabtree, Peterborough. Tyler was not taken to hospital for four hours after suffering the fatal injuries, by which time medics could not save him, the court heard. Doctors tried to resuscitate Tyler for 20 minutes but he died from blunt traumas to the head and abdomen. Killer: Elvis Lee admitted manslaughter but denied murder while Stephanie Whelan was found guilty of causing or allowing the youngster's death . The court heard Lee and Whelan's relationship had been 'volatile' and Whelan had suffered a black eye at the hands of Lee in the past. Christopher Donnellan, prosecuting, said: 'Lee has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Tyler because he admits he kicked Tyler in the abdomen and accepts that caused a significant injury. 'He has also admitted that he bit the leg of Tyler. It was a drastic and hard bite to the calf of the child's leg. 'The prosecution case is that he inflicted these injuries on that morning. He intended Tyler should suffer serious injury or death. That was his state of mind.' Following the attack, Whelan and Lee claimed the next morning Tyler fell from a stool in the kitchen and they found him lying face down with a bleeding nose at about 6am - then took him back to bed. The court heard how Tyler's mother had . left her son alone with abusive Lee, despite his history of violence - . and being aware he was attending anger management courses. In a harrowing 999 call Stephanie Whelan . can be heard wailing down the phone as a man - believed to be Elvis Lee - . shouts in the background. The inconsolable mother can be heard hyperventilating down the phone line as the operator tries to make sense of the noise. A man can be heard saying: 'He can't breathe, he's got breathing problems."" Then Whelan can be heard sobbing: 'There is nothing I can do for him.' Lee is due to be sentenced tomorrow while Whelan is expected to be sentenced on June 14 following a pre-sentence report. Heartbreak: Tyler's father Shaun Harrison looks on whilst a statement is read by DS Simon Megicks, of Cambridgeshire Police . Following the verdict, Superintendent Simon Megicks, of Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said: 'This was a wicked crime in which an innocent five-year-old was murdered by a person who should have been looking after him. 'Lee is a controlling and violent man who lost his temper and inflicted fatal injuries to Tyler. 'Whelan has been found to have allowed his death following these fatal injuries - Tyler deserved more from his mother. 'Every child has the right to be protected and feel safe in their own home and it is a parent's responsibility to ensure this is the case.mThankfully, this type of crime is very unusual. 'It is our responsibility to ensure that offenders are identified and effectively brought to justice and I am pleased that this has happened in this case. 'I hope this verdict brings peace to Tyler's relatives knowing justice has been done.' In statement read outside the court on . behalf of Tyler family, his father Shaun Harrison said: 'The last year . of my life has been unbearable. 'Tyler was a fun-loving mischievous little boy with a big heart and amazing smile. 'I feel lost without him in my life and I can't believe he has gone. 'It hurts me that I will never get the . chance to see him grow up and see the man he should have become.'","Elvis Lee, 34, kicked and BIT defenceless Tyler Whelan in savage attack .

The Boss star, who is now happily married to British flight attendant Kayte Walsh, sat down with Oprah Winfrey on Sunday for an emotional interview on Oprah’s Next Chapter. With his new wife by his side, Kelsey opened up about everything from his new hit television series, to his contentious divorce from Camille Grammer. Opening up: Kelsey Grammer sat down for a revealing interview on Sunday night with Oprah Winfrey . Kelsey, who refused to utter Camille’s name, revealed that  - for him - the 13 year marriage was over before it even started, telling Oprah he remained out of duty to the former Playboy model. 'I stayed because I’m a stubborn cuss. I was not in it, or happy in it for a long time. It was pretty much over as soon as it began,' Kelsey said. While he refused to say her name, the actor didn't hold back when it came to his ill feelings toward Camille. Emotional: Oprah wiped away tears as Kelsey opened up about his failed marriages, past drug use and finding love with new wife Kayte . Happy at last: Kelsey had nothing but praise for his fourth wife Kayte . 'She always wanted to be famous,' Kelsey said before admitting he helped her secure a role on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. 'I did believe that I owed something to that person,' he added about his appearances on the Bravo reality show adding, 'that I owed fame.'

A 41-mile stretch of highway under construction in Texas could be the first U.S. road to have an 85 mile per hour speed limit, according to the Texas Department of Transportation. Texas State Highway 130 will run between between Austin and Seguin, a town just east of San Antonio, with the aim of taking traffic loads off of Interstate 35. The major north-south highway was named the fourth most congested road in the state by the Texas Department of Transportation last year. Study: Officials in Texas are testing a new 41-mile segment of Highway 130, a section of which is pictured, to see whether it would be safe to post the state's first 85 mph speed limit . Most of Highway 130 is built - and speed . limits are posted at 80 mph - with the remaining section set to open . before the end of this year. 'We'll definitely take a look at that stretch, and we will conduct speed studies to see what that speed limit will be,' Darren McDaniel, the Texas Department of Transportation's speed management director, said at a conference this week. The agency is looking at the toll road's topography, checking what speed most drivers are traveling on existing parts of the highway and ensuring the access points and cross-sections would still be safe with an 85 mph speed limit, spokesman Mark Cross added. The Texas Legislature passed a law last year that allowed speed limits of up to 85 mph on newly constructed highways that were determined to be safe enough to allow such speeds. Fast: The Texas Legislature passed a law last year that allowed speed limits of up to 85 mph on newly constructed highways that were determined to be safe enough to allow such speeds . Location: Texas State Highway 130 will run between between Austin and Seguin, a town just east of San Antonio, with the aim of taking traffic loads off of Interstate 35 . Texas and Utah are currently the only states with speed limits of 80 mph. The 85 mph speed limit would be the . fastest posted maximum in the Western Hemisphere and the second fastest . in the world, according to Rhino Car Hire, a European car rental . company. It said a speed of 140 kilometers per hour, or about 86 mph, is . posted on some roads in Poland. Should the US raise highway speed limits to 85 mph? Before the federally mandated 55 mph speed limit was approved in 1974, several Western states had high speed limits, and Montana and Nevada had some roads with no posted speed limits at all. Germany's Autobahn system has no posted speed limits for passenger cars, but speed is restricted for other types of vehicles. Critics say higher speed limits will lead to more fatal accidents, but McDaniel said the safest roads are ones where all motorists are traveling the same speed. Studies of drivers on that stretch of highway now show most are traveling about 85 mph, he said. 'The more people we can get to travel a uniform speed, the safer are the conditions that will exist,' McDaniel said on Wednesday at the annual Texas Transportation Institute road safety conference in San Antonio. Officials first proposed the 85 mph speed limit on a now cancelled toll road project, in hopes that it would convince more motorists to choose toll roads, and lessen congestion on free stretches of highway.","The major north-south highway was named the fourth most congested road in the state .

But for Claire Dinnen the experience is a particularly worrying ordeal . This is because her son Frankie falls and bangs his head up to 20 times a day - and doctors don't know why. The mother-of-two is forced to watch the four-year-old cry in despair as he repeatedly drops to the ground. Call: Desperate mum Claire Dinnen is trying to get medical treatment for her extremely frail son Frankie . He has suffered a string of injuries, including black eyes, and he has to sit in a pushchair when going out for his own safety. Frankie even has to be carried to bed because of the risk of falling down the stairs. Worse yet, Miss Dinnen from Rainham, Essex has waited six months to see a . specialist to find out what is wrong with her frail son while his . condition is failing to improve. She finally saw a paediatrician at Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, yesterday and Frankie is now due to have a MRI scan. She said: 'I am happy that Frankie has finally got to see the paediatrician. But I am disgusted that it has taken so long for this to happen.' She said last December Frankie was diagnosed with low muscle tone, a condition that makes his muscles stiff and lack firmness. Claire said she was told the unsteady . child would need a series of further tests to find out the underlying . cause of the condition, but was left waiting for six months for a follow-up appointment. She said: 'I was fobbed off every time I called to find out about his appointment and how long he would have to wait. 'I am really worried now about poor Frankie's safety because he can't walk without falling and hitting his head.' Injury: This picture shows one of the bruises four-year-old Frankie has suffered after falling over . Claire said she first noticed something was seriously wrong with Frankie when he started walking at the relatively late age of two. Frankie, who also has a twin sister called Stevie and older sister Stacie, 10, cannot walk down the road without falling. Claire also fears that Frankie will hurt himself at school as she's not there to supervise and look after him. She said: 'We have reached a stage where we are scared for him. He is just like any other boy, so he will run, but he will fall. 'I wish I could keep him at home to protect him. The school has reached the stage where they are finding it hard to look after him.' A Queen's Hospital spokesman said there had been a delay in getting Frankie's referral notes over to the North East London Foundation Trust.

Dozens of unpaid jobseekers are to deliver patient care at three hospitals in the Midlands, an NHS Trust has revealed. It follows a successful pilot at Sandwell Hospital, West Bromwich, where six unemployed people worked for eight weeks to help care for patients on wards. A spokesman for Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals trust, which runs the scheme, said the placements gave jobseekers a real taste of healthcare. Extra help: The unpaid ward service assistants help with making drinks and even help feed patients (file picture) 'The pilot is now complete and, after further consultation with trade unions and managers, we are aiming to run similar programmes across out three hospitals,' they said in a statement. However, union representatives for medical staff said they were concerned that the move showed a 'worrying glimpse of the future.' Ravi Subramanian, head of Unison in the West Midlands told The Guardian that the Birmingham and Sandwell hospital trust was being forced to find £125m worth of savings over the next five years. He added: 'Now the hospital is making moves to deliver healthcare on the cheap, by using people on work experience to help with patient care. Patients and staff will rightly be very worried about the standard of patient care as this scheme is rolled out.' The NHS Trust defended the 'ward service assistants' scheme, saying the participants were all CRB checked and underwent two weeks of training at Sandwell College before carrying out basic tasks. These included making hot and cold drinks for patients and helping to feed them if necessary, as well as collecting medication from the hospital pharmacy to give nurses more time on the wards. Pilot: Six participants helped nurses on wards at Sandwell Hospital . Assistant Director of Nursing Linda Pascall added: 'We have really appreciated the support the ward service assistants have given to the wards. 'Their positive attitude has made this venture a success and we hope to be able to continue to work with our Jobcentre Plus partners to offer this scheme which has proven to have genuine benefits for our local community.' Pauline Jones, Account Manager at Jobcentre Plus, said two of the six people had already gained employment thanks to their work experience. Sue Horsburgh was one of the six participants and said she found it very rewarding. 'When I started on my first day, there was a lady who was quite poorly. She couldn’t talk and all she could really do was put her thumb up but I went to see her in my last week and I had a conversation with her,' she said. 'I went home each day and felt I had done something worthwhile.' Fellow ward service assistant, Jennifer Howell, said the role had given her the confidence to start a new job working with people with learning difficulties. And Sarah Jones, another of the six to undertake the placement, said she now wants a career as a healthcare assistant. 'I love it,' she said. 'There was nothing negative. I know that after doing this I never want to do anything else ever.' Until Feburary this year, people on Government work experience schemes faced having their benefits cut if they left unpaid schemes. However, ministers changed the rules following a meeting with scores of employers after protests by activists who complained that the unemployed were being forced to work for nothing.",Jobseekers helped feed patients during pilot scheme at Sandwell Hospital .

Two Western female doctors and three Afghan colleagues have been kidnapped by masked gunmen in a remote area of north-east Afghanistan. Officials said they were snatched while travelling on horseback between Yaftal and Ragh districts, about 55 miles from Badakhshan provincial capital Faizabad. A witness said: ‘I saw gunmen surround them. The people who kidnapped them had scarves over their faces. Abduction: The workers were intercepted while travelling by donkey from the city of Faizabad . ‘They kept the two women on the horses and told the Afghans to walk in front of the horses. The kidnappers took the group’s bags and carried them themselves.’ The doctors and their colleagues, believed to be a guide and two interpreters, were employed by a non-profit humanitarian organisation, the Swiss-based Medair, and had been working to help to treat malnourished children. Abdul Maroof Rasikh, spokesman for Badakhshan province’s governor, said it was unclear who kidnapped them. A massive search operation involving police, military and volunteers was underway, he said, but the area was rugged and ‘very difficult’ to travel in. It is the same area where British surgeon Karen Woo, 36, was murdered in 2010 by militants as she returned to the capital Kabul. The area is not known as a focus for Afghan insurgents but is home to groups of mainly criminal gunmen. Police said the aid workers had been visiting a health clinic in Yawan district, where the road had been destroyed by floods. 'They were travelling by donkey. Two foreign women and their Afghan translators were kidnapped and we have started a search operation,' said Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, police spokesman for northern Afghanistan. British aid worker Khalil Dale, 60, was kidnapped and killed in neighbouring Pakistan earlier this year . NATO-led forces said they had no information on the kidnapping, while NGOs operating in the area declined to comment citing the sensitivity of the issue. The kidnapping of foreigners has become relatively common in parts of Afghanistan since U.S.-backed Afghan forces toppled the former Taliban government in 2001, sparking a decade-long anti-insurgent war. Concerns for the hostages' safety are likely to be high after another Western aid worker, captured in neighbouring Pakistan, was executed last month. Khalil Dale, 60, was taken at gunpoint while working with the British Red Cross in January. He was found beheaded and riddled with bullets on April 28, in an orchard in the south-west city of Quetta. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility and along with the body was a note addressed to the chief of police, which read: 'This is the body of Khalil who we have slaughtered for not paying a ransom amount.' And in October 2010, British aid , worker Linda Norgrove died in a botched rescue attempt after she was taken hostage in Kunar province. It was originally reported that the 36-year-old, from the Western Isles, had died at the hands of her captors but an investigation later revealed she was in fact killed by a grenade thrown by the U.S.-led team of would-be rescuers. Earlier this month a video was posted on jihadist websites in which American captive Warren Weinstein is seen urging Barack Obama to meet Al Qaeda's demands and set him free. Mr Weinstein, 70, was working for a development consultancy in Pakistan, where was taken from his house in the city of Lahore last August.","Women snatched while travelling on horseback .

Nineteen areas in parts of the North, the West and the Midlands were declared drought-free yesterday by the government’s Environment Agency. However, it has refused to lift the alert for the Thames Water area and South-East England, despite the fact reservoirs are full to overflowing. Filling up nicely: Bewl Water in Kent, a county where hosepipe bans remain in force . Shrinking fast: The same reservoir two months ago before weeks of rain began to refill it . As a result, millions of families who have put up with weeks of downpours still face threat of prosecution for using a hosepipe in the garden or to wash the car. Britain had 4.8in of rain in April, which was the highest level on records that date back to 1910. The downpours have continued into May. Liscombe in Somerset was the wettest place in the country with 10.8in of rain, which was more than three times the average. Areas no longer in drought include Somerset, Bristol, Cornwall, Devon, Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, parts of Gloucestershire, Hampshire, and Wiltshire. South Yorkshire, East Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, West Midlands, and Warwickshire are also given the all-clear. The status of these areas meant residents and businesses were under threat of a hosepipe ban, although no restrictions had been put in place. Heavy showers continued to pummel . parts of the North and Wales yesterday. In the North-West, parts of . Cumbria were plunged back into winter after snow fell overnight. Weathermen say many areas will enjoy . some relief this weekend with a touch of spring warmth. Temperatures . could read 16c in some areas. However, the reprieve will be short-lived, with the rain expected to return by the middle of next week. The Environment Agency said the heavy . rainfall of recent weeks has restored many rivers and reservoirs. However, levels of ground water, which is reached through bore holes, . are still low in many areas. Companies that are still officially . covered by drought and continue to have a hosepipe ban in force include . Thames, Anglian Water, South East Water, Southern Water, Sutton and East . Surrey Water,  Veolia Water Southeast and Veolia Water Central. However, there is anger that firms . behind the bans are allowing almost a quarter of all treated water to be . wasted through leaks in their pipes. Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman yesterday defended the need to maintain hosepipe bans. ‘Even the record rainfall we had in . April and the prediction of more wet weather in May won’t make up for . the shortages in these areas caused by two extremely dry winters,’ she . said. She said it would only be possible to . bring the drought to an end in all areas if the country gets several . months of very wet weather. Richard . Aylard of Thames Water said: ‘No water company wants to impose . restrictions on its customers for any longer than absolutely necessary. 'We . still have a serious groundwater shortage, and we could yet have a . long, hot summer, so, much as we’d love to, it would be irresponsible . for us to lift the hosepipe ban just yet.’ The . Environment Agency’s chief executive, Dr Paul Leinster, said: ‘Low . groundwater levels remain a concern across many parts of England, with . many still at a similar level to those in 1976 and unlikely to return to . normal levels before the winter.’ Summer colours: Dogwalker Katie Pryor takes in the bright scenery at Castle Howard, near York, where heavy downpours have given way to dry spells . Contrast: The same could not be said for workers on the A9 near Inverness today, where snow swept in during Britain's changeable May weather . They think it's eel over: These 3ft fish were spotted on a football pitch in Wrexham today thanks to heavy downpours in north Wales . Something fishy's going on: The 3ft-long fish were washed onto fields at Wepre Park in Connahís Quay, Flintshire . MeteoGroup Forecaster Brendan Jones said: 'We should see a bit of a break from the heavy rain over the weekend. 'Today will see more of the same for parts of Scotland and northern England, with some hill snow in northern Scotland. 'From Manchester southwards, there may . be one or two showers but a lot of the day will be mainly dry. Some . sunshine will come through which will be welcomed. 'Most . of the country will have a fairly good day on Saturday. There may be . the odd showers but many places will be dry with some sunshine. 'Temperatures . will range from 12 to 15 degrees, which isn’t brilliant for May but . better than it has been. By Sunday, most of England and Wales should see . some pretty good weather.' The Met Office shared their optimism . in finally predicting a brighter weekend for Britons with temperatures . reaching a respectable 16C. A . forecast for Saturday on their website said:'A much brighter day . generally, with a good deal of sunshine. Probably somewhat cloudier at . times in the afternoon, though. Light winds.' Spring has sprung... for some: This woman enjoys a walk through a rape seed field in Chelsfield Village, Kent today . Lovely view: London's newest addition to its skyline, the Shard tower, can be seen in the background from this rape seed field in Kent . Back to capacity: Bewl Water Reservoir in Kent was back at normal levels today after earlier drought conditions left it almost drained . What a difference: The same reservoir, Bewl Water, in February fell to worryingly low levels rarely seen in winter . All seasons: In Alston, Cumbria, it was British summertime in name only as flurries of snow drifted in overnight . Forecasters had predicted brighter dry spells in parts of England and Wales, but their prediction clearly didn't apply to the Cumbrian hills this morning . Ground to a halt: A team of workers battle to carry on their work in the snowy conditions in Inverness this morning . Snow journey: The white stuff continued to come down north of the border today in Inverness, despite forecasts of sunny spells in England and Wales . South Yorkshire, East Yorkshire, Cornwall, Devon, . Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, parts of Gloucestershire, parts of Hampshire, . most of Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, . Staffordshire, West Midlands, Warwickshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, . Herefordshire. Sunshine . will certainly be welcomed across the UK, as heavy flooding saw bizarre . scenes like those in north Wales, where downpours caused a football . pitch to be invaded by eels. The 3ft-long fish were washed onto fields at Wepre Park in Connah’s Quay, Flintshire, used by under-11 teams. Firefighters in North Yorkshire were . called to a number of localised incidents yesterday including the rescue . of 350 sheep and lambs caught out by a flooded river in the Yorkshire . Dales. The fire service had also attended reports of flooded properties, mainly in the Skipton and Harrogate areas. There were a number of reports of a flash flood in the village of Summerbridge, north of Harrogate.

What a washout: Glum-faced shoppers trudge around Swansea, south Wales, on a miserable day . Meteorologists said the flash flooding was likely to have been caused by a narrow band of exceptionally heavy showers which worked its way across the North Yorkshire region yesterday afternoon. Mr Jones said the band of downpours - only 5-10 miles wide in places - combined with the high general rainfall levels seen across the region on Tuesday night to produce the exceptional totals. He said: 'With that volume of rain coming down, the water just hasn’t anywhere to go.' Mr Jones added there were dramatic differences in temperature levels between places caught in the wave of downpours and those just outside. He said the North Yorkshire seaside town of Scarborough, which had 0.3in (7mm) of rain in an hour yesterday afternoon, only saw a high of 13C (55.4F) today, whereas at Bridlington, just a few miles down the coast, temperatures hit 21C (69.8F). The highest rainfall figure was in Shap, Cumbria, which saw 1.4in (36mm) in 12 hours yesterday and 2.4in (62mm) in 24 hours. Mr Jones said the narrow band of exceptionally heavy rain had now moved out to the North Sea and the more general rainy weather was moving towards Scotland. While Britain has battled through torrential downpours and unrelenting rain in recent weeks, those in Australia have been lapping up record conditions of a far more enjoyable variety. Sun worshippers were spotted in the Australian city today basking in temperatures of 29.1C - the warmest day in May for more than 70 years. Only three days in the last summer have been recorded as warmer in Sydney, and there has been no rainfall recorded in the city this month. Lapping it up: Two sun seekers top up their tans in Sydney, where peak temperatures of 29.1C have seen the hottest May day in 70 decades . Despite being autumn in Sydney, only three days have been warmer this summer, according to experts . Weatherzone meteorologist Doug Fenton told the Sydney Morning Herald the temperature of 29.1C at Observatory Hill in Sydney was the hottest day in May since 1942. He said: 'We've had a high pressure system which has been planted directly overhead,' Mr Fenton said. 'That's brought some sunny skies over the last few days and really allowed surface temperatures to heat up. 'We've also had north to northwest winds bringing in that warmth from the interior ... that meant we're seeing the heat build up over the last few days.'

A bereaved wife once voted Mum Of The Year has been convicted of fraud after claiming widow’s allowance long after her new partner had moved in. Benefits cheat Kelly Harvey, 30, won the award in February 2008 just five months before her husband Leyton, 25, lost his battle with cancer. The mother-of-two, from Stapenhill, Staffordshire, began claiming the allowance soon after her husband’s death to help look after daughters Leigh and Mollie. Kelly Harvey, from Stapenhill, Staffs, has been convicted of fraud after claiming widow's allowance since her new partner, Ryan Archbold (pictured with Harvey), moved into the family house in 2010 . But Harvey carried on claiming the money - given only to single parents who have suffered bereavement - after new boyfriend Ryan Archbold moved into the family home in late 2010. Harvey dishonestly received £8,302 in widowed parent’s allowance and council and housing tax benefits between 2010 and last year, Burton Magistrates’ Court heard. Debbie Leadbeater, prosecuting for the Department for Work and Pensions, said: 'She began claiming the bereavement benefit in July 2008 following the death of her husband. She claimed this for her children and herself. Leyton Harvey (above), 25, died of cancer in 2008. His wife had won Mum of the Year after caring for the couple's two daughters while also visiting him at hospital in Nottingham . 'But she had a partner who was employed and living with her from 2010. 'His vehicle, credit cards and bank accounts were registered to her address. 'The widowed parent’s allowance should not have been paid after November 2010.' Harvey was named Mum Of The Year by local newspaper the Burton Mail in 2008 at a New Year’s Honours ceremony held at Branston Golf and Country Club. She was pictured in the paper receiving her award from then editor Paul Hazeldine. Mrs Harvey was praised for her dedication in caring for the couple’s two daughters while fitting in daily visits to her husband’s bedside at hospital in Nottingham. The death of her husband later that year made the paper’s front page as tributes poured in to her husband, an employee at engineering firm Roger Bullivant. Leyton Harvey had previously defied a bleak prognosis in his fight against testicular cancer which spread to his spine, chest and lungs. Following the death of her husband, Harvey posted a tribute to 'my life, my soul life and best friend' on memorial site GoneTooSoon.org. She wrote: 'Leyton, my life, my soul mate and best friend, what do i do now? Things were once so great so happy, everyday life was fun just you me and our two little girls, now everything is so empty without you. 'Things where perfect until you was diagnosed with cancer, but even you didn't let that get to you, some days you didn't even look ill, you always looked great to me. 'The best news for all of us came 8 months later when you got the all clear and you could eventually come home to us for good, it had been so long since you’d been home it was going to be great, a family once again all under one roof. 'You came home at the end of May and how great was that? Our perfect little family back together once again, but then you started being sick and feeling week, but the doctors didn't seem too worried, just a bug they said, but you didn't get better and within just 3 weeks of you coming home you was back in hospital, but this time you didn't come home, you died within 4 days, organ failure. 'Now we're lost and trying to find ourselves again but it ain't easy, everything we do, songs we hear all remind us of you and the love we all shared, one day I’ll be with you but for now you have my heart, love you always babe xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx kelly, leigh & mollie.' Neil O’Driscoll, defending, said Harvey began claiming the benefits legitimately after Leyton’s death. He said: 'The dishonesty didn’t occur from inception. It began some two years after she first claimed the money when she found a new boyfriend. 'He used to stay at the property a few days each and every week. He eventually moved in and she should have disclosed that she was no longer eligible for the money. 'This was not dishonest from the outset. It became dishonest two years later.' According to Harvey’s profile on social networking site Facebook, Harvey attended Burton and South Derbyshire College and now works at River View Primary and Nursery School in Suffolk Road, Stapenhill. Magistrates bailed Harvey until May 31, when she is due to return for sentencing after a probation report has been prepared.","Kelly Harvey's husband, Leyton, died of cancer in July 2008 .

'Good experience': Thief Alister Lamb (pictured) faces jail after missing his community service appointments because he was taking part in the Jeremy Kyle show . A thief is facing jail after he went on the Jeremy Kyle Show instead of doing his community service. Alister Lamb was convicted last year of stealing a string of items including a toilet seat from a flat in Dundee. On November 11 last year, Sheriff Tom Hughes imposed 200 hours of unpaid work in the community as part of a community payback order instead of sending Lamb to jail. But Lamb - who has previous convictions for cannabis possession and assault to injury - completed only one hour of work between that date and April 10 this year. And when asked by social workers why he hadn’t done the work he told them he had missed appointments because he had been filming an episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show. He had gone on the show in a bid to get access to his daughter from a previous relationship. Despite now facing a period in custody, Lamb said: ‘It was a good experience.’ Lamb, 23, of Baldovie Terrace, Dundee, previously admitted a charge of theft by housebreaking. He and another man broke into a flat occupied by William Wallace in Whitfield Avenue, Dundee, between February 11 and 12 last year. They stole a television, an xBox console and accessories, ornaments and a train set. Bizarrely, the pair also stole a toilet seat in the raid. In a report submitted to Dundee Sheriff Court outlining the breach of his order, social workers said: ‘It would appear that Mr Lamb has not afforded his orders due priority which is evidenced by his continued failures to attend. ‘His most recent evidence to cover absences was an appearance on TV, namely the Jeremy Kyle Show. ‘He reports that he now has access to his children which he contributes to his recent appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show. ‘There has been no other substantial changes in his circumstances that should preclude him from attending. 'Mr Lamb again has not afforded his order due priority. ‘This despite having been granted extensive periods of time in which to submit evidence. 'No commitment to order': Lamb said he was a 'really nervous' during the filming of the Jeremy Kyle Show. The episode he appears in has not yet aired . ‘Even when evidence has been submitted and accepted’ I have no option but to call in to question his commitment to his order given the most recent evidence used was an appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show. ‘I therefore have no alternative but to request that court consider revoking said order in view to imposing an alternative disposal.’ Lamb would have faced a jail sentence when he appeared in court for sentence today, but he failed to attend court at 9.30am. Sheriff Tom Hughes granted a warrant for his arrest. Lamb then turned up at court at 10.40am, but was told his case could not be recalled. Outside court, Lamb said he had been transported to and from the filming of the show by taxi and had been put up in a hotel by producers. He said: ‘I wasn’t that good, I was really nervous. It was a good experience though. ‘I watch the Jeremy Kyle show on the telly, so I thought I’d phone them. ‘I was trying to get access through the lawyers, but I thought I’d try this instead.’ A spokeswoman for the Jeremy Kyle Show said the episode Lamb was involved in has not yet been aired.","Alister Lamb convicted of stealing toilet seat from flat .

Passengers travelling on Pepys Road in Brockley told of the moment the driver said he saw a spark on the bus and ordered everyone off. Everyone on the bus escaped the terrifying incident unharmed, despite the fire also causing two cars parked nearby to burst into flames, according to one eye-witness. Burning bus: within minutes the double-decker goes up in flames - but incredibly, no one is injured . The bus was engulfed in flames on Pepys Road in Brockley, South East London . Emergency services were called and . firemen began trying to control the blaze. But as they got to work, one . of the bus tyres exploded on the other side of the road, setting a car . on fire. A spokeswoman for the Fire Brigade told Mail Online: 'The incident took place at 8.22am on Pepys Road, SE14 and a double-decker bus and a motor car were both damaged by a fire'. She said the fire service received 31 calls to the incident. A spokesman for the police added: 'All passengers were evacuated and there were no reports of any injuries.' He said the cause of the fire was still unknown but they were not treating it as suspicious, adding: 'Obviously the cause of the fire will be investigated.' Reverend Sheridan James of St Catherine's Church, whose vicarage was next to the site of the explosion, said she was eating breakfast when she heard a bus passing that sounded 'a bit noisy'. She told the Mail Online: 'Then it made a hissing sound and there was a loud bang.' Double whammy: as fireman control the fire on the bus, a tyre hits a nearby parked car, causing it to go up in flames as well. Incredibly, the church and other nearby buildings were undamaged . Revd James rushed out to see what was happening. 'Within minutes the bus was consumed in flames with black smoke coming from it,' she said. 'It looked like a bomb explosion.' When she saw the fire on the bus spread to two cars that were parked nearby, she quickly dressed in her clerical garb in case she was needed to offer any assistance. Incredibly, there were no fatalities and no injuries. 'About 30 to 50 people were gathered, a lot of them residents,' she said. 'They were initially very scared.'

She said passengers believed the fire had been caused by an electrical fault on the bus, and paid tribute to the quick-thinking driver. 'People were saying the driver saw a spark. He got everybody off the bus and within minutes it was ablaze.' The incident could have been far worse, she added, given that the explosion happened in a built-up area, with a school situated opposite the vicarage and the church, and many over-hanging trees that could have caught fire. 'Really, given how awful it was, it's amazing there were no fatalities and no damage the buildings,' she said.","Quick-thinking driver evacuates bus after seeing a spark, say passengers .

Senior store managers at Tesco have been left outraged after being told their annual bonus will be slashed by more than 80 per cent. Around 5,000 store managers and executives were sent a letter by boss Phil Clarke last week warning them that their annual performance-based rewards would be dramatically reduced following a dire year. Last year the managers received 100 per cent of their bonus pot entitlement with many receiving on average £12,000, but this year it will drop to 16.9 per cent the equivalent of between £2,000 and £3,000. Drop: Thousands of Tesco store managers and executives were sent a letter from boss Phil Clarke warning their annual performance-based rewards would be dramatically fall following a dire year . Most employees had been braced for a cut in their bonuses after the retailer posted a profit warning in January – its first in recent history - but the scale of the drop has taken many by surprise with morale said to be at rock bottom. Cut: Tesco chief executive Phil Clarke has written to around 5,000 store managers and executives telling them their annual bonus will be slashed . Next week the retailer, which is the third largest in the world, will reveal the scale of pay and rewards for its board directors in its annual report. In the current climate where fat-cat greed is firmly under the spotlight, Tesco managers want to see that board directors have been treated in the same way. Over the past few months the retail giant has lost ground to its rivals amid fierce competition in its home market. It’s big price drop campaign has been widely seen as a failure trounced by others who have attracted more customers with vouchers and fresher stores. Tesco’s share-price has tumbled 21.42 per cent over the past 12 months. In a letter seen by the Daily Mail, Clarke, who has taken over the running of the troubled UK stores, said: ‘Last year was a difficult one despite delivering another record set of results. ‘The group missed its profit targets and had a mixed performance across our six corporate objectives - we missed the threshold for UK return on capital employed and our UK like-for-like sales target. ‘Following a review of our performance for 2011/12, the executive committee has approved an award of 16.9 per cent of your maximum bonus.’ Succession: Phil Clarke last year took over as Tesco chief executive from Sir Terry Leahy who had been in the role since 1997 . Staff are understood to have reacted badly after learning they will be entitled to the lowest proportion of the ‘short-tern bonus pool’ for 20 years. The rewards are closely linked to performance. The letter was sent last week to senior store managers up to the level just below the board. A spokesman for Tesco said: ‘Tesco’s top 5000 leaders, including the executive directors, all have genuinely performance linked incentives and these are closely aligned. ‘We will announce full details in our annual report published later this month and those at the top of the company will take their share of the impact of last year’s results.’ The issue of executive pay has become a lightning rod for investors who have seen share prices go south as bosses continue to reap fat-cat rewards. Clarke, who succeeded Sir Terry Leahy as chief executive, posted a one per cent drop in annual profits from its UK stores to £2.5bn last month and denied that the supermarket giant is in trouble. Between December and February underlying UK sales dropped by 1.6 per cent, and during the whole year they fell by 0.9 per cent.","The retailer posted a profit warning in January – its first in recent history .

It’s really no wonder two in three Americans are overweight when they can choose between a pork belly-topped cheeseburger, 1,500-calorie cheesecake and sandwiches stuffed with mozzarella sticks. The worst eight dishes for over-the-top fat and sodium content have been unveiled by a health advocacy group in a group of ‘dishonourees’ - but they’re sure to get your mouth watering. From the Cheesecake Factory’s 1,530-calorie burger to the Cold Stone Creamery PB&C Shake, which has a whopping 2,010 calories, these are certainly poor choices if you’re planning a diet. Scroll down for full list . Juicy: IHOP's Monster Bacon 'N Beef Cheeseburger has two types of cheese on a Romano-parmesan bun . Mouth-watering: Denny's Fried Cheese Melt includes four fried mozzarella sticks and melted American cheese . Cut above: Morton's Porterhouse Steak weighs 24oz before it's cooked and comes in at 2,570 calories . The list was released by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and features offerings from other restaurants, including Denny’s, International House of Pancakes and Applebee's. The group suggests a typical adult should limit calorie intake to 2,000 a day and keep saturated fat below 20g and sodium below 1,500mg. But each serving of the Xtreme Eating Awards winning menu items - mostly twists on the usual suspects of burgers, dessert and all things fried - nearly reaches or surpasses these guidelines. Denny's Fried Cheese Melt is a grilled cheese sandwich with four fried mozzarella sticks inside. It amounts to 1,260 calories and 21g of saturated fat, not to mention 3,010mg of sodium. Applebee's Provolone Stuffed Meatballs with Fettuccine has 1,520 calories and 43g of saturated fat. Big eat: The Cheesecake Factory Farmhouse Cheeseburger is topped with grilled smoked pork belly . Dessert: Cold Stone Creamery's PB&C Shake, left, and Cheesecake Factory's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake . The Cheesecake Factory's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake alternates two pieces of red velvet cake with two pieces of cheesecake, for 1,540 calories and 59g of saturated fat. ‘If Americans are feeling a little more . full when lumbering out of The Cheesecake Factory, Applebee’s, Denny’s, . and other chains, it’s not in their heads' Bonnie Liebman, CSPI nutrition director . Cold Stone Creamery's PB&C Shake (peanut butter and chocolate) has 2,010 calories and 68g of saturated fat. Two out of three Americans are overweight, and such dishes increase their risk of obesity, diabetes, heart attacks and cancer, said Bonnie Liebman, the centre’s director of nutrition. ‘If Americans are feeling a little more full when lumbering out of The Cheesecake Factory, Applebee’s, Denny’s, and other chains, it’s not in their heads,’ Ms Liebman told the CSPI website. Denny's and Applebee's both said they offer a wide variety of choices. Denny's pointed to its Fit Fare menu, and Applebee's to its Unbelievably Great Tasting and Under 550 Calories options. Tasty bowl: Great Steak's extra-large order of King Fries are topped with cheese and bacon . Italian: Applebee's Provolone-Stuffed Meatballs with Fettuccine has Provolone cheese-stuffed meatballs . Other restaurants have not yet commented. The U.S. government is trying to push restaurants to disclose nutritional information on their menus. The Food and Drug Administration plans to issue rules requiring restaurants to list nutritional and caloric information by the end of the year. Sue Hensley, of the National Restaurant Association, said the organisation’s data is showing restaurants are now offering a much bigger range of options including healthier foods. ‘Consumers can use the nutrition information provided by many restaurants and make the choices that makes the most sense for their diet,’ she told USA Today.

"By . Becky Barrow and James Chapman . UPDATED: . 04:35 EST, 21 June 2011 . Women hit hardest by controversial changes to the state pension age will be given a lifeline, ministers confirmed last night. Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told MPs that ‘transitional arrangements’ will be made to help those most affected. His apparent concession comes after the Daily Mail repeatedly highlighted how women in their late 50s would be affected more than any other group by cost-saving increases in the pension age. Concessions... but Iain Duncan Smith failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit . Only yesterday it emerged that senior Lib Dem ministers told the Treasury that some kind of compromise was ‘inevitable’ to soften the blow. Mr Duncan Smith repeatedly signalled that concessions will be made. He also said he would ‘happily look at transitional arrangements.’ But he failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit. At present, a woman can start receiving her state pension at the age of 60 years and seven months. A man must wait until he is 65. Under the changes, the age will reach 65 for both men and women in November 2018 – and will rise to 66 by April 2020. Devastated: Barbara Bates will be forced to work for an extra two years . MP yesterday waved through the change when the Pensions Bill received its second reading after the Government offered to hold talks with critics about how the change would be introduced. It was given a second reading by 302 votes to 232, Government majority 70. Women are the biggest losers from the changes, with around 2.6million having to wait longer before their pension begins to be paid. But Mr Duncan Smith insisted that it would affect only a 'relatively small number of women' and that delay would cost the taxpayer £10 billion. He offered to hold 'discussions' with MPs over the 'transitional arrangements', but maintained: 'We stand by the need for men and women's state pension ages to equalise in 2018. 'And both will rise together so the state pension age reaches 66 in 2020. This Bill will go forward on that basis. 'If we delayed the move to 66 until 2022 it would cost the taxpayer £10 billion - an unfair financial burden borne disproportionately by the next generation.' Of the total, around 500,000 will have to wait more than a year and 33,000 will have to wait exactly two years. There is broad agreement on the need to equalise and raise state pension ages, which were first set in 1926. But MPs on all sides say it is unfair that one particular group of women will be hit so hard, losing as much as £15,000 each. Dame Anne Begg, Labour chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, even warned that the proposals risked creating a ‘new poor’ of women forced on to benefits until they reach the new state pension age. Former Conservative justice spokesman Eleanor Laing urged the Government to think again. ‘No one can object to the equalisation of pension ages when we’re fighting so hard on other areas of equality,’ she told Mr Duncan Smith. ‘You are absolutely right to do what you’re doing. ‘But will you recognise that there is a particular group of women – some 300,000 of them – born in 1954 for whom the transition arrangements are rather more difficult than they are for any other group of society? Will you look at other ways of helping that particular group of women?’ Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Jenny Willott said the legislation currently did not ‘pass the fairness test’. But she insisted it was worth backing and that changes could be made to improve it. Former Labour welfare minister Frank Field said the Coalition was right to seek to make savings. He suggested pension age increases for both men and women after 2020 could be accelerated slightly to pay for easing the burden on women in their late 50s now. As reported in yesterday's Mail . This idea was also raised by Government sources last night. It could cause resentment, but most pension experts agree ten years’ notice of relatively minor changes would be sufficient. In his response, Mr Duncan Smith said he would ‘happily look at transitional arrangements’. It is not clear, however, whether these will apply to the 33,000 biggest losers, or the larger number of 500,000 women. Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: ‘The ideal solution would be to revise the timetable. Tinkering is better than nothing but we need to see the detail.’ Campaigners yesterday warned the Government could face a legal battle if changes were not made. Experts raised the threat of a judicial review because it is ‘unreasonable’ to force through such high-speed changes to women’s state pension age. Labour’s pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves accused the Government of ‘clearly breaching’ its coalition agreement. That document said the state pension age would not be increased ‘sooner than 2020 for women’. In fact, it is starting to rise in 2018. But Tory Richard Drax accused Labour of failing to deal with the pensions’ crisis when in power. He said: ‘It has long been apparent that something had to give. Our national longevity has increased by an average of ten years since the 1970s.’ QUENTIN LETTS: YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT . For decades we have been told that women must be treated equally. Many a bra was burned to a frilly crisp. Germaine Greer cabbaged away about little else for the best part of 40 (or was it 50?) years. Chaps had their ears boxed for gawping at Miss World and domestic rolling pins were wielded like Johannesburg sjamboks. Mrs Letts even took up DIY. Now, hooray, we ardent feminists have something long overdue to celebrate. The state pension age for men and women is to be made equal. Female pensioners will no longer be given preferential terms. Hard stare: Yvette Cooper didn't much like Iain Duncan Smith's plans for pension reform . Equality for all! Strike up the Internationale! But what happens? Politicians are in uproar, talking about how 'unfair' it all is. You can't win. Iain Duncan Smith, Pensions Secretary, played things sotto when he came to the Commons yesterday afternoon. He opened the Chamber's doors to find row upon row of crosspatches sitting there, steaming like a kitchen of Chinese saucepans. Arms were crossed. Fingers were being drummed. Uh-oh. The House had a mood on. Mr Duncan Smith has never been one of life's shouters – it makes him cough – so he did not try to pick a fight. He did try one or two tiny jokes but soon dropped that tactic. Wise. As many an errant man has been told, 'don't think you can laugh me out of it – it ISN'T funny!' Mr Duncan Smith faced the likes of Labour MPs Fiona Mactaggart (Slough), Joan Walley (Stoke on Trent N) and frontbenchers Rachel Reeves and Yvette Cooper. The editorial board at Spare Rib magazine was scarcely more formidable. IDS's reluctance to become openly hostile was understandable. Even Neanderthal man knew when not to risk life and limb. All but the most novice circus tamers resist baiting a lioness when her tail is twitching. Shadow Home Secretary Miss Cooper was there simply out of interest, or maybe peevishness, for Pensions is no longer her realm. She gave Mr Duncan Smith one of those chilling, old-fashioned stares, the like of which no chap can ever fully ignore. You may know the type of glare. It is like being bored into by a Black and Decker. Miss Reeves stepped up to the despatch box repeatedly to give it an imperious whack. Mr Duncan Smith took her interventions. She did not like what he told her, but at least he had given vent to her fury. The Reeves voice is a forceful instrument. Put a bag over your head and she could be twin sister of the late and masterly Bernard Bresslaw. As a former Opposition leader, Mr Duncan Smith has a certain insurance policy. He is coated by that special varnish Westminster reserves for those who have failed in lofty office. Lack of success makes them popular. And so Mr Duncan Smith found some of his critics opening their sallies with little preambles about what an admirable fellow he usually was. Labour's Rachel Reeves, left, and Fiona Mactaggart were among the MPs that Mr Duncan Smith had to face . Thanks to his tact, the House did not ignite. Indeed, when his shadow, Liam Byrne, later spoke from the despatch box, there may have been increased warmth towards the Secretary of State. Mr Byrne was dismally partisan and seemed barely to grasp the necessity of pensions change. As IDS explained, longevity has made a nonsense of the sums. When the state pension system started, it was on a ratio of nine people working to every pensioner. This is now three to one, and will soon be two to one. It's actually pretty amazing that no government has seized the issue beforehand. Mr Duncan Smith said that 'responsible government is not always easy government' and claimed that 'we will stay the course'. Yet he also said that he did 'not rule out a discussion' about how to help women born in 1954, who may be unlucky in the way the adjustments are made. That sounds as though a cop-out is being prepared. Can't we just send them some flowers instead and promise to take them to the pictures?","Pensions Bill given a second reading by 302 votes to 232, a Government majority 70."

A teacher told a student in her classroom that he could be arrested for saying something bad about Barack Obama. The social studies teacher at North Rowan High School in Spencer, North Carolina told the student he could go to jail for speaking negatively about the President - but that it was fine to criticise Mitt Romney. Video captured the intense debate between the two as the teacher demanded that Mr Obama be respected, while the student insisted he had a right to share his own opinions. Scroll down for video . 'No disrespect': A teacher at North Rowan High School (pictured) in North Carolina told a student that he could get arrested for talking bad about Obama . On the video, the teacher can be heard discussing with students a recent report that Mr Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, had bullied someone as a youngster. The 10-minute video uploaded to YouTube last Monday appears to be taken from a cell phone where only voices can be heard and it does not show anyone inside the classroom. As the teacher explains the Romney allegations, the student asks: 'Didn't Obama bully somebody, though?' The teacher responds that she was not aware of Mr Obama being a bully. She begins to raise her voice telling the student not to make 'degrading' comments. The student tries to reply: 'If you're going to talk [about] Romney...' But he is interrupted by the teacher, who starts shouting. 'Uh-uh! Stop! Stop! No! Because there's no comparison. He [Mr Romney] is running for President. Obama is the President.' The student, not satisfied with that answer, went on to say: 'If you're going to talk trash about one side, you gotta talk trash about the other.' However, the teacher disagreed. She said, 'Let me tell you this: you've got to realize this man is wanting to be what Obama already is, OK?' She continues, screaming: 'That's disrespect! That's disrespect!' 'Stop! No!': When a student asked whether Obama was ever a bully, the teacher angrily demanded that the student say nothing negative about him . The student contends that the teacher is the one being disrespectful - to Mr Romney. This infuriated the teacher. She insists that the student follow her rule. The teacher cried out: 'You will not disrespect the President of the United States!' The student retorted: 'I'll say what I want.' She angrily counters: 'Not about him you won't.' As the exchange went on, the student told the teacher that he had different beliefs than her and when he asked a question about Mr Obama and bullying, the teacher got 'defensive' and 'freaked out.' 'No comparison': When the student asked why it was OK to discuss Mitt Romney, the teacher said he should be treated differently as a candidate . Then he tries to reason with the teacher that plenty of people have talked badly about President George W. Bush. The teacher answered that the student needed to stop slandering the current President because 'people were arrested for saying rather poor things about Bush.' Unconvinced, the student offers his viewpoint: 'You would have to say some pretty f***ed up crap ... to be arrested. 'They cannot take away your right to have your opinion or your freedom of speech. They can't take that away... unless you threaten the President.' The teacher demands to know whether the student was aware that the police do not always read Miranda rights when a person gets arrested. 'They can't take that away': The student did not believe the teacher when she said people have been arrested for talking bad about George W Bush . The student responds: 'Well, I've never been arrested.' After some minimal discussion on how government officials sometimes say negative things about presidents, the teacher make her case that negative comments about Mr Obama will not be tolerated inside her classroom. School officials who have reviewed the video say they will not share the teacher's name because it is a personnel matter. The woman has not been removed from the district. In a statement to the Salisbury Post, district spokeswoman Rita Foil said: 'This incident should serve as an education for all teachers to stop and reflect on their interaction with students.' Political analyst Michael Bitzer told the news agency that he was not aware of any arrests of people for negative comments they made about Mr Bush. He said: 'I think what this broke down to was a perceived personal slight by an instructor against someone she sees in a positive view, and things just went out of control from there.'

A baby boy was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness using Facebook - after a friend spotted his rare condition which doctors had missed. Little Evan Owens suffered from seizures but medics thought he was just holding his breath during tantrums. In a desperate bid to get to the bottom of the worrying attacks, mother Cerys, 33, filmed one of the seizures and posted it onto her Facebook page. Missing clues: Evan Owens, now four, was suffering life-threatening seizures which doctors mistakenly thought were actually him holding his breath during tantrums . She asked anyone on the social networking site: ‘Does anyone know what this is?’ And one of her friends quickly messaged back saying it looked like a rare condition called Reflex Anoxic Seizures. It can be triggered by pain, a fright and causes the heart to slow down or even stop altogether. Cerys and her husband Rob, 35, of Ystradgynlais, Swansea, South Wales, took baby Evan back to the doctor and suggested the Facebook diagnosis. The tot was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where it was confirmed he was suffering from had Reflex Anoxic Seizures. Desperation: Concerned mother Cerys Owens posted a video of her son Evans' fits in a last-ditch attempt to find out what was wrong . Civil servant Cerys said: ‘It was terrifying when we didn't know what it was - he was having up to 17 seizures a day. ‘If I had not gone on Facebook we would still not have had a clue what was causing them. ‘There needs to be more awareness. It's a very unknown condition.’ ‘Facebook comes in for a lot of stick and criticism but if it helps one more parent like this it's worth it.’ Doctors say Evan, now four, should grow out of the condition as he grows up. Teachers at his nursery school know what to do if he has an attack which can last 45 seconds and send him unconscious. Force for good: Now armed with the correct diagnosis thanks to the Facebook post, Cerys, pictured with other son Alun, 2, and her husband Rob, 35, has praised the power of the online community . Mother-of-two Cerys said: ‘He will say afterwards that it goes black, and there is a buzzing sound in his ears. ‘He can either be very tired and clingy, or also very angry as he comes to understand what has happened to him. It's heartbreaking.’ Experts say the condition, like other heart rhythm disorders, can be hard to diagnose. Jenni Cozon, head of patient services at the Stars, a charity which helps people with the disorder, said: ‘Sadly, Cerys is not alone in her struggle to find the correct diagnosis for her baby. ‘Many children with RAS are misdiagnosed with breath holding.’","Doctors put little Evan Owens' seizures down to him holding his breath during tantrums .

A chef who was knifed in the back by his girlfriend while he was sleeping proposed to her in court through her barrister. Gregory Todd, 48, bought a diamond ring to the courtroom as Tiffany Baillie, 32, admitted carrying out the attack on him. He almost died after she plunged a 12-inch kitchen knife into him and had to undergo emergency surgery. Proposal: Gregory Todd has forgiven his partner for plunging a knife into his back as he slept - and yesterday wanted to give her this ring as she appeared at Hull Crown Court . But Grogory says he has forgiven his partner and now wants to marry her. Baillie was remanded in custody at Hull Crown Court after her barrister said Todd had brought a ring to court and wanted to propose. Now the chef must wait until Wednesday to find out if she will say yes. Mr Todd insists his partner carried out the attack as he slept in their flat in Hessle, Humberside, because she had lost two babies. She could face up to 12-years behind bars when she is sentenced next week. Speaking outside court, Mr Todd said: 'I love her I want to marry her. She . didn't know I was going to propose today but I was. 'I wanted to give her . the ring but they won't allow it in prison. I hoped she would get a . suspended sentence, so I could propose today. 'She had a miscarriage and lost our baby two weeks before this . happened and it was the anniversary of the day she lost her son Lucas . who was 10 weeks old. We were both upset. Now I just want her home.' Mr Todd is not yet well enough to return to work. The Honorary Recorder of Hull and the East Riding, Judge Michael Mettyear, said he has a 'difficult decision' to make about how long to jail Baillie for when he sentences her next week. The court heard she stabbed Gregory, a chef, after the couple had an argument while out on December 4 last year after both had been drinking. Gregory said it happened close to the anniversary of the death of her ten-week-old son, Lucas, and just weeks after she suffered a miscarriage. He said: 'This just isn’t like her. She doesn’t need to be locked up, she needs help. There were a lot of signs, which maybe I should have picked up on, but I didn’t. 'If somebody I didn’t know stabbed me in the street, I would want them hung, drawn and quartered. 'But I don’t hold this against her at all. Seeing her in prison is my worst nightmare.' Baillie wept when her barrister, Paul Genney, revealed Gregory’s plans to propose during her court appearance yesterday. Gregory, who has made a full recovery, said he visited her in prison after he was released from Castle Hill Hospital. He said: 'She said she was sorry and asked me to forgive her, which I do, completely. 'I lived with this woman. Before this happened, I was looking forward to eating Christmas dinner together as a family. 'I was planning to propose to her on her birthday, on December 29. Then I was in hospital for Christmas, her birthday and New Year.' The couple met when they were both working together as chefs at the Lairgate Hotel in Beverley. Baillie and her 12-year-old son later moved into Gregory’s flat. He said: 'She is perfect for me. We have a lot in common and get on really well. I want her to come out so we can get married and get our lives back.' Baillie admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Jharna Jobes, prosecuting, said the sentencing range for similar cases is nine to 16 years, with a typical starting point of 12 years. Mr Genney said: 'What is very unusual is the complainant asking for leniency. Most victims would want you to lock them up and throw away the key. 'He says he wants to marry her and has brought an engagement ring to court.' Judge Mettyear said: 'This is a very difficult case. The guidelines suggest I should impose a very long sentence, but I have to consider how much weight I can give to the views of your victim.'","Gregory Todd, 48, must wait until WEDNESDAY to find out if girlfriend will say yes .

Police investigating the death of a woman who feel to her death from a hang glider have seized a video card recording her final minutes - after it was apparently swallowed by her instructor. Lenami Godinez-Avila, 27, was celebrating an anniversary with her boyfriend with a hang-gliding excursion in the Canadian province of British Columbia. But tragedy struck when she tumbled out of her harness only seconds after take-off. Police investigating the death of Lenami Godinez-Avila, left, have seized a video card which they say had been swallowed by hang-glider pilot Jon Orders, right . Witnesses said the young woman fell almost 1,000 feet to her death while her boyfriend, David, watched. Police said her boyfriend had been waiting for his turn for a ride at the time of the incident last Saturday. Hang glider pilot Jon Orders has been held in custody following allegations that he swallowed a video card which may have recorded events leading up to the incident. He was granted bail yesterday when he appeared in a provincial court in Chilliwack, British Columbia. Earlier this week, Royal Canadian Mounted Police told a court that X-rays showed the card was inside Orders' body. But officers confirmed yesterday that they now have the card. 'We . have processes in place in order to try and extract what's been on the . card that will not be further discussed at the moment,' Police Constable . Tracy Wolbeck said. Ms Wolbeck said police were focusing on answering questions from Miss Godinez-Avila's family, from Mexico. Search for clues: Police examined the hang-glider after the body of Miss Godinez-Avila was found . Crash site: Police believe information stored on a video card could help explain why the incident happened . 'They've come to Canada in search of answers,' the police officer added. Police have not provided any further details about when the card was consumed or how they learned about it. They have also said they have seized video taken by the boyfriend on the ground. Orders is a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience. His business website, Vancouver Hang Gliding, states that photos and video are available when people purchase a tandem hang-gliding trip. When police announced the charge on Monday, they said Orders was accused of withholding key evidence. The young woman's body was found in a forest clear cut below Mount Woodside, a popular spot for hang gliders to launch from above British Columbia's Fraser Valley. Jason Warner, safety officer for the Hang Gliders and Paragliders Association of Canada, said that he spoke to Orders minutes after Godinez-Avila fell from the glider. Accused: Orders, a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience, was granted bail yesterday . Mr Warner said Orders told him he knew something was wrong almost immediately and tried desperately to hang on to the woman, who clung to his body and then slipped down his legs, taking one of Orders' shoes with her. A witness, Nicole McLearn, told CBC that when the glider was in the air, Miss Godinez-Avila appeared to be wearing her harness, but it wasn't attached to the glider. The passenger clung to Orders before she fell, Ms McLearn said. 'He was horizontal but she was now hanging vertically, and it looked like in essence she had him in a bear hug around the chest area,' Ms McLearn added. Miss Godinez-Avila, who was an . administrator at the provincial Ministry of Environment, went hang . gliding after her boyfriend bought her lessons for their anniversary. He was video-recording the flight, but had stopped taping before she fell. Friends of Miss Godinez-Avila have set up a memorial fund and scholarship to remember her. One friend, Katherine Louman-Gardiner, told CTV News: 'She was a bright and caring, charismatic person and we miss her terribly. 'She loved contributing to the community around her.' Miss Godinez-Avila's former professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, Anil Hira, paid tribute to her. 'She was just starting out, she was extremely successful, someone who walks on air, very light-hearted but extremely capable. 'It's the last person you would want to see this happen to.' The woman's death marks the second high-profile fatality related to hang gliding in recent months. In October, 16-year-old Lois Preston, described as an experienced pilot, died from injuries sustained when her glider crashed in Ashbourne in England.","Canadian officers obtain video card which may hold clues to why Lenami Godinez-Avila died in the crash .

Bit part actress and Ocado delivery driver Karen Williamson, 46, smashed frail Jean Jobson repeatedly in the head and face with a hammer and heavy glass jug until her 'skull literally collapsed,' the Old Bailey heard. The 'gruesome killing' of the 'vulnerable lone old lady,' known as Pat, was only discovered two days later when family and friends alerted police after being unable to contact her. Police broke into Mrs Jobson's home . in Bromley, south-east London, to find her dead body and the phone left . off the hook last February. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Former EastEnders extra Karen Williamson, 46, left, has been jailed for at least 24 years after pleading guilty to battering Jean Jobson, 86, right, to death in her own home in Bromley, south-east London last year . Animal lover: Although childless, Mrs Jobson always kept dogs and in the weeks before her murder she took in a homeless Staffordshire bull terrier after her elderly Labrador dog had to be put down . Judge Paul Worsley QC told . Williamson: ‘No doubt those remaining years for [Mrs Jobson] were doubly . precious. You took them from her despite her age. ‘She was an independent, caring member of the community, much loved by her family. ‘The family of Pat Jobson have had to wait a very long time to see justice in this case. ‘The attack which you carried out was sustained and brutal. Under the influence of crack you carried out a frenzied attack. ‘You used a hammer which broke in the course of its use and you used a . heavy glass jug to hit her repeatedly. There is also some evidence of . manual strangulation. ‘Pat Jobson, despite her age, put up a valiant fight against you as she . tried to protect herself from your blows. The evidence against you was . overwhelming.’ Mrs Jobson's purse and jewellery, including . her late husband’s wedding ring on a chain she wore around her neck, were stolen by mother-of-one Williamson, a crack addict who worked as a . 'casual' gardener for her. Williamson, . an extra on EastEnders who has also appeared on ITV’s The Bill, then . pawned the stolen jewellery for just £61 and hid the stolen purse in a . drain yards from her own front door. In . a victim impact statement, Mrs Jobson’s nephew Mark Montgomery said: . 'We can’t express the anger we feel towards the person responsible for . Pat’s horrific murder. 'My entire family are bewildered as to how this ever occurred, especially to Auntie Pat who was loved and respected by so many. 'She was in good health for her age and in no way deserved to have her life cut short in such a cruel and despicable manner.' The judge said he had concluded this was a ‘murder for gain’ and deserved a higher minimum term. He told Williamson: ‘I am satisfied you had not gone there to steal but when you got to the house you made up your mind that you would steal. ‘You clearly intended that she die. You stole her jewellery. Two days . later you took it to a pawn shop. You got a paltry £61 for it.’ The judge said that Williamson’s . crack cocaine habit ‘may well have released your inhibitions but it does . not mitigate what you did.’ Earlier prosecutor, Brian Altman QC, told the jury: 'The manner of the killing of this elderly woman in the sanctity of her own home defies belief because of its nature and savagery. 'Her killer had set about her with a . hammer and heavy glass jug striking her several times to the head and . face so hard and so often it quite literally caused her skull to . fracture and collapse. 'She died from head injuries, the injuries from forced and repetitive blows injured the brain within. Mr .

Long after the guns fell silent at Antietam, the earth yielded up gruesome reminders of the bloodiest day of the American Civil War: bodies, bones, buttons and entire severed limbs – one of which is now the focus of intense study at the National Museum of Civil War Medicine. A Sharpsburg-area farmer is said to have found the human forearm while ploughing a field two weeks after the 1862 battle. Officials at the museum in Frederick, Maryland, are trying to learn more about the limb in hopes of verifying that it's a relic of the Battle of Antietam and exhibiting the well-preserved specimen during the battle's 150th anniversary in September. The muddy-looking right forearm, with skin and hand attached, was donated anonymously to the museum earlier this year, said Executive Director George Wunderlich. Relic: The severed arm, believed to be from the September 1862 Battle of Antietam, was donated anonymously to the National Civil War Medicine Museum after having been displayed for decades at a private museum . It had been displayed for several decades at a private museum in Sharpsburg in a glass-topped, pine case with a placard reading, 'Human arm found on the Antietam Battlefield.' Though there is little hope of identifying the young man who lost it, Mr Wunderlich said forensic experts may be able to discern his nationality and whether the arm was, as Mr Wunderlich suspects, torn from his body by a bullet or artillery round. 'Being able to put the story of this unknown person before this country is very important to us,' Mr Wunderlich said. 'His remains will tell a story that will relate us back to his sacrifice. This was what they gave for what they believed. If done properly, it's a very poignant story.' The unidentified farmer who found the limb put it in a barrel of brine, according to Thomas McGrath's 1997 book, Maryland September: True Stories from the Antietam Campaign. The farmer reportedly gave it to a Boonsboro physician, who is said to have more permanently preserved it with embalming fluid. Bloody, bloody: The Battle of Antietam took place across a bridge in western Maryland, and is considered the bloodiest one-day battle in American history . Casualties: Bodies await burial in front of Dunker Church Antietam. The battle was the bloodiest day in American history with over 20,000 casualties . The arm eventually ended up in a private museum that was sold in the 1960s to John G. Ray Jr. After Ray died in 2001, his widow had the museum's contents sold at an auction, according to battlefield historian Ted Alexander. Alexander grew up nearby and remembers seeing the arm on display. 'It was quite an attraction,' he said. 'It was macabre and something to see as kid.' The arm's owner was probably a small man less than 20 years old, said William Gardner, a former Marshall University forensic medicine instructor who examined it in March. All dead: The bodies of Confederate soldiers killed during the Battle of Antietam lie along Hagerstown Pike . Since the elbow joint is undamaged, with no surgical saw marks, the arm was likely removed somewhere between the shoulder and elbow, he said. The forearm skin and tendons appear to have been violently twisted. More than 23,000 soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing after the 12-hour Battle of Antietam, called the bloodiest one-day battle in American history. It took place on September 17, 1862 across rural fields in western Maryland. It was the first invasion of the North by Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his army, the Army of Northern Virginia. President Abraham Lincoln, speaking two days before the battle, gave the Union his blessing, saying: ‘God bless you, and all with you. Destroy the rebel army if possible.’ The battlefield's history and geography offer clues about how a solitary arm could end up buried in a farm field. 'That entire battle took place in people's fields, their yards,' Mr Gardner said. The pivotal clash on September 17, 1862, left more than 23,000 soldiers dead, wounded or missing in the war's bloodiest one-day battle. Historians say some were blown to bits by the furious gunfire. Many were buried were they fell, their shallow graves crudely marked for their eventual removal to cemeteries. Some remains were never retrieved. In 2009, a battlefield visitor found bone fragments and uniform buttons of an unknown soldier from New York State. But it's rare to find bones still covered with skin.'It is really an impressive piece,' Mr Gardner said. Museum curator Lori Eggleston said she's keeping the arm dry and handling it as little as possible on the advice of experts at the Mutter Museum, run by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. A piece of history: The National Civil War Medicine Museum is located in Frederick, Maryland . Healing hands: The museum documents how doctors treated soldiers on and off the battlefield 150 years ago . Mr Wunderlich said he hopes to have a Smithsonian Institution forensic anthropologist examine the arm for clues about the owner's diet and origin . Battlefield Superintendent Susan Trail said the arm can't be displayed at the Antietam visitor centre because the National Park Service generally forbids displaying human remains. But she said the medical museum could display it at the Pry House, a field hospital site that the museum runs on the battlefield. 'I'm sure the museum will do a very nice job with what they do with it,' Ms Trail said. 'When you think about it, it's pretty awful what happened here – and you just multiply it many, many times over.'","Hand found by farmer two weeks after bloody 1862 Battle of Antietam .

Shocking attack: Trevor Gray raped the woman after the pair had been out for drinks in Nottingham city centre the same night . A detective sergeant was jailed for eight years today for raping a mother in her home. Trevor Gray attacked the 43-year-old woman after the pair had been out for drinks in Nottingham city centre that night, after meeting through mutual friends. The Nottinghamshire detective forced the security chain on the front door of the mother of one’s house, climbed the stairs and attacked her as her child lay sleeping in a nearby room. At Derby Crown Court today, Judge John Wait told Gray: 'These are grave offences. 'You forced an entry into a home where your victim and her child were entitled to feel safe. 'You took advantage of her intoxication to rape her. She felt - and was - violated in her own home.' The jury took less than three hours to convict Gray yesterday of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault. Judge Wait jailed Gray for eight years for rape, six years for attempted rape and four for sexual assault, to run concurrently. The victim told the court she could not recall much of their date, despite only having three glasses of wine and lemonade and a 'strong' vodka and Coke bought for her by Gray. She said she was shocked when Gray followed her out of a taxi outside her home. She invited him inside 'through courtesy', before asking him to leave after 15 minutes because she was going to go to bed. He left through the back door, saying he was going to get a taxi at the top of the road. Gray then sent a text . message to the woman from the street outside, which read, 'You are . harsh' and forced his way back in minutes later. The mother sobbed as she told the court her next recollection was of him being naked in her bed on top of her and raping her. Jailed: Gray was sentenced to eight years for rape, six for attempted rape and four for sexual assault, to run concurrently . She told the court she had felt unable to confront Gray because her young child was in the house at the time. Sentencing the father of two, who had separated from his wife just a month before the attack, Judge Wait said: 'You are intelligent and arrogant, you thought you would get away with it. You did not believe she would have the courage to complain or that if she did she would be believed. 'These are grave offences. You forced entry into the home where your victim and her child were entitled to feel safe. You took advantage of her intoxication to rape her. She felt and was violated.' The detective, who has served in the police for more 20 years, will now be removed from Nottinghamshire Police. Judge Wait said: 'I take account of your previous good record, your excellent service in sensitive roles within the police force and the high regard in which you were held by your colleagues. I take into account the fact that a sentence because of your profession will be harder for you to serve.' Relatives, friends and police colleagues were in court today for the sentencing. Many sobbed as he was jailed for eight years. Brutal: The 47-year-old has lost his job for forcing entry into the home where the woman and her child were sleeping and carrying out the attack . But Judge Wait added that Gray’s actions had had a 'catastrophic effect' upon his victim’s life. He said: 'She no longer feels safe in the home she had moved into with pride only eight weeks before. She cannot go to bed without feeling your presence in the room. Her life has been devastated.' Gray was told he will serve half of the eight-year sentence in custody and the remainder on licence. A restraining order was also put in place preventing him from contacting the victim either directly or indirectly and his name will be placed on the sex offenders’ register. The detective sergeant was suspended from duty on July 27 last year, four days after the attack, pending the outcome of the investigation. He will now also face misconduct proceedings, Nottinghamshire Police said. After the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Mick Windmill-Jones, of the force’s professional standards directorate, said: 'We expect our officers and staff to act with the very highest standards of behaviour, integrity and professionalism - on or off duty. 'When they fail to display these qualities and commit a criminal offence, they can expect, like any other member of society, to be arrested, charged and prosecuted in a court of law. 'Trevor Gray’s actions go against everything the role of a police officer stands for, which is ultimately to protect innocent people. 'We take all reports of sexual assault and rape extremely seriously and do everything we can to both support victims and ensure cases like this are brought to justice, regardless of who the alleged offender is.' The officer shook his head in the dock yesterday as he was convicted. The court was told Gray, of Watnall, Notts, had 'plainly intended' to have sex with the woman and she had 'upset' his plans. Steven Coupland, prosecuting, said: 'He tried to call her but she ignored his calls, and texted her and asked her to get him a cab. Grave offences: The judge said Gray had 'violated' the mother in her own home . 'Instead of him calling a cab himself, he decided to return to her address despite the fact it had been made plain he was being asked to leave. 'He rang the bell. He did not take the message. He found the door was not locked but had security chain on to make it secure. 'What he did was the force that chain. He went upstairs to where she was sleeping and went into her room. She woke to find he was on top of her.' Mr Coupland said the victim recalled he tried to get her to touch him intimately, before raping her - even though she told him to stop. Jurors were told the next memory the woman had was waking up at 5.30am to find Gray still in bed with her. The woman said Gray appeared to be unaware she was 'uncomfortable' - even when she asked him several times how he had got into her home. She eventually plucked up the courage to call him a taxi and, as he was leaving, spotted the broken security chain. She told the jury Gray said: 'Don’t worry, I’ll fix it', causing her to lose her temper and push him out of the house. Later that day, she told a friend her version of what had happened, then called Gray 'to go through the sequence of events'. However, she said Gray appeared 'cold', and when he asked her, 'Does this put you off me?', she hung up. The next day, she spoke with a police officer friend, who reported the matter to her superiors. Gray claimed he had returned to the woman’s home and found her door ajar before forcing his way in because he 'thought something might have happened to her.' He told the jury he 'fell back into his mode as a trained police officer and decided he would enter to save a life effectively', before finding the woman sitting up in bed awake. The court heard Gray, who was suspended after his arrest, told officers she had initiated sex, and the pair had 'parted on good terms' with a kiss on the doorstep the following morning. He said he had no idea anything was wrong until he received her call. The court was told the pair had met on a night out with mutual friends around a month before the attack on July 24 last year. They swapped phone numbers and exchanged 'jokey' texts before meeting for a drink. The woman said Gray appeared 'articulate, funny and pleasant', and they met again a few days later. However, the woman said that despite only having a few drinks, she 'could not remember much' of the evening', and just had a 'vague recollection' of being unable to understand why Gray got out of the taxi at her house. The woman added: 'I never invite people back to my house. Even if I have decided someone is OK, it is not something I do. I did not even find him attractive. 'I vaguely remember saying he needed to go, I needed to go to bed, and he needed to get a taxi from the top of the road. He went out the back door. 'My memory is of locking the door and putting the chain on. I remember being woken by the bell ringing lots and lots of times. I just ignored it and went back to sleep. 'The next thing, I was aware of a naked person. He was over me. I was in bed. I said ""don’t do that"". It was not what I wanted.' Gray had denied rape, attempted rape and sexual assault.","Derby Crown Court convicted Trevor Gray, 47, of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault yesterday .

The youngster lost his own when he was four months old after he became critically ill with meningitis. Surgeons were forced to amputate them below the knee in order to save his life. Now Louie has received his first prosthetic pair in time for his first birthday. Louie Jenkins wears his new legs. Doctors have told his parents to let him guide them with how long he wants to wear them . His parents, Julie, 29, and Warren, 31, from Colne, Lancashire, hope he will soon learn to walk and take his first steps. Mrs Jenkins said: 'It was so weird looking at the legs and thinking that Louie will learn to walk with them on. 'We were so nervous before he got them. We were worried that he may not like them or feel uncomfortable. We didn’t want to have to encourage him to wear them if he didn’t want them on. 'We put his trousers on the legs and we were told to buy shoes to be placed on the feet.' Louie was given the legs yesterday at a specialist prosthetics unit at Seacroft Hospital in Leeds. He also lost all of the fingers on his left hand and the tips of his fingers on his right hand. Louie was too young to be walking when he lost his legs . Mrs Jenkins said: 'When he first had them put on, he grabbed the shoes and smiled. We were so pleased. He was so comfortable in them that he fell asleep wearing them in the car on the way home. 'He looks much older now he has the legs because he is taller. He always seemed much younger than his sister Francesca was at this age but now he seems more like a toddler than a baby. 'We have been told to let him lead us with how much time he wants to spend wearing the legs. If he wants to wear them for a little as half an hour a day we will let him. 'We are hoping that, if he wants to, he may be able to crawl with them. We have been told that we need to encourage him to walk wearing them in just the same way that we would any other child.' As he gets older the money raised will also be used to buy state-of-the-art prosthetic legs at a cost of around £7,000 per leg. Julie added: 'As Louie is growing it . doesn’t really make sense to be spending that amount of money on legs . that he will keep growing out of so he will just have the NHS ones for . now. 'As he gets older . he may want to take part in sport and we want to be able to say that we . have the money to be able to buy him the legs that he wants.' Louie back in March: He lost his legs from below the knee to meningitis . Julie said that doctors praised her quick reaction spotting the first warning signs and that if she had left it any longer he may have died. 'I had bathed Louie with his sister Francesca as normal but throughout the night he kept waking up crying and was sick, I noticed he had a temperature so stripped him down and gave him some Calpol. 'It was when I stripped him down that I noticed two small red pin prick marks. I pressed on them and they didn’t go away so thought something was wrong. 'Within a matter of minutes he had gone grey and floppy so I rung for an ambulance. 'As I was watching he went from having a few marks to all his legs and arms turning purple. 'They took him to Airedale and treated him for meningitis, it was all a bit of a shock and it didn’t really hit home until we had the results of the blood test which confirmed that he had meningococcal septicaemia.' Louis was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where he was kept in intensive care for two weeks then put onto the children’s surgical ward. She added: 'The doctors said that if I hadn’t checked on him and spotted the rash when I did that Louis probably would have died. 'The first 48 hours were touch and go and after that they gave him a 50 per cent chance of survival which gradually increased as the days went on.' Louie’s family have set up the Little LAMB (Louie’s Amazing Meningitis Battle) Appeal to help buy equipment needed to support him as he grows. They aim to be able to have enough money to buy specialist prosthetic legs at the cost of £7,000 per leg by the time he wants to take part in sports.","Louie's legs were amputated below the knee when he was four months old .

The callousness of metal thieves has hit new depths with the theft of a memorial to two children murdered by the IRA. Last night the father of one of the victims expressed his ‘utter disgust’ at the ‘despicable’ crime. Colin Parry denounced the heartless thieves who stole the plaque commemorating the 1993 Warrington bombings, which killed his son Tim, 12, and another child, three-year-old Johnathan Ball. The death of the two boys touched the heart of the nation and Mr Parry received an OBE for his  peace campaigning after the atrocity. Father's anguish: Colin Parry and his son on holiday, a year before Tim was killed at the age of 12. The plaque (right) put up in memory of Tim and the other victim Johnathan Ball, 3, has been stolen by scrap metal thieves . Police say the A3-size plaque could have been sold for scrap for as little as £30. It is the latest in a series of abhorrent thefts of memorials by criminals exploiting the soaring value of scrap metal. War memorials, lead from church roofs and cables from railway lines have been targeted. Each year, at least 15,000 tons of the 13million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to be stolen, worth an estimated of £800million. Last night Mr Parry – who received an OBE for his active role in the Peace Process after the bombings – said: ‘It makes me feel utter disgust and it is reprehensible that someone should disfigure what is a memorial to two young boys and see it as something they can make money from without any consideration for the families who lost loved ones. ‘It beggars belief that people can be so heartless and I don’t expect that they have any conscience. ‘It is remarkable the lengths that some people will go to make some cash and it is one of those crimes that is so off the scale that it is disgusting.’ The Warrington bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in February 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the Cheshire town. In the second attack, The Samaritans received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in Liverpool. In the event, there were two blasts, in litter bins outside Boots and Argos, within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion. Johnathan Ball was killed almost instantly and Tim Parry was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine. More than 50 other victims were injured, with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass. Bombing victims: Johnathan Ball, aged three, and Tim Parry, 12, who were killed in the blast in Warrington in 1993 . The bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren. Mr Parry, 65, a human resources consultant, said of the thieves: ‘Even if they are really hard up it is without any justification. ‘It really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters. ‘It leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in, in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered. They did not give a moments thought to the significance of what they had just stolen. It is despicable.’ His wife Wendy, 54, said: ‘It’s really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind. Tim and Johnathan had so much to live for and I wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought. ‘It is a sign of the times, I suppose, but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day.’ The bombings triggered a campaign for peace, with Mr and Mrs Parry – who have two other children – working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between Britain and Ireland. They set up a Peace Centre in the town and played an active role in the Peace Process in Northern Ireland, for which Mr Parry was given his OBE in 2004. Tragically, the parents of Johnathan Ball never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast. Johnathan’s father, Wilf Ball, 69, died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days. The boy’s mother, Marie Comerford suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son’s murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart. Stolen: This is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the IRA blast was placed. Police are today hunting for the people who took it . The bronze plaque, which depicts the course of the River Mersey as it flows through the Borough of Warrington, reads: ‘The central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in Bridge Street in 1993.  Young people helped the artist with the design work.’ Helen Jones, Labour MP for Warrington North, said: ‘This is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other Warrington people who were injured in the bombing. ‘Warrington is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it didn’t turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace. But these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves.’ David Mowat, Conservative MP for Warrington South, said: ‘I am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped.’ Liz Antrobus was 22 when she and her 29 year-old fiance Gordon Edwards were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb. They suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim Tim Parry’s mother, Wendy. Yesterday Mrs Edwards, 40, said: ‘It’s awful, absolutely awful and I don’t know why someone would want to do something like that. It is irrelevant that it happened so long ago because the events on March 20 1993 still have an impact today.’ Resident Amy Edwards, 34, said: ‘This is one of the most shaming crimes. They are nothing but sick vultures who have no respect.’ Yesterday PC Graham Davies, of Cheshire Police, said: ‘This plaque forms part of a memorial and is of great significance to the town.’ He urged scrap metal dealers who may have information or may have been approached to buy the plaque to contact police immediately.

Hundreds of workers at the world's largest electronics manufacturer have rioted at a factory in China, resulting in dozens of arrests. An estimated 1,000 Employees at the Foxconn plant in Chengdu, southwest China, clashed with security guards who had attempted to prevent a man stealing  on Monday night, according to Taiwan-based news website Want China Times. Foxconn makes many of the world's most popular gadgets, including Apple's iPhone and iPad, the Amazon Kindle and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles. The manufacturer has previously come under fire for forcing staff to work long hours and in unsafe conditions for low pay. The riot at the Foxconn factory in Chengdu, southwestern China, comes after reports of poor working conditions at the plants . Workers reportedly threw bins, chairs and even fireworks at security officers from the upper floors of the building after the riot broke out in a dormitory at the plant. Two guards had called out to stop a thief but staff took the opportunity to air their grudges at working conditions. The clash ended after two hours when hundreds of police officers were called to the scene and dozens were arrested. The riot is the latest high-profile incident to affect Foxconn, which employs up to 120,000 people at its Chengdu plant, and more than one million in total. Under fire: Workers queue to enter the Foxconn factory in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. The company employs more than one million people . Blast: A Foxconn worker arrives at a hospital in May last year after an explosion on an iPad2 production line . Up to 14 Workers at a separate plant . in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, committed suicide by throwing . themselves from the top of the factory in 2010. Apple CEO Tim Cook has vowed to work for better conditions for Foxconn employees . An explosion in May last year killed two and injured 16 employees who were working on the iPad 2 production line at the Chengdu factory. Foxconn's customers, including Apple, have been criticised for failing to encourage changes at the Chinese manufacturer's factories. An investigation ordered by Apple earlier this year found 'significant' problems at the plants. Employees can work 76-hour weeks and for 11 days in a row, yet are paid as little as £150 a month, around three-quarters the country's average wage and less than half the price of the iPads they produce. Apple CEO Tim Cook has vowed to work to improve conditions at the plants, where 90 per cent of the technology firm's products are made, including reducing overtime, which the report found some workers were not paid for. 'We want everyone to know what we are doing, and we hope that people copy. We've put a tonne of effort into taking overtime down,' Cook said in May. The announcement was seen as a landmark decision that would change the way Western companies would deal with Chinese firms.

People with Parkinson’s disease suffer a decline in their quality of life years before they are diagnosed, it is claimed. Scientists have documented declines in physical and mental health, pain, and emotional health beginning several years before the onset of the disease. And the decline then continues at a rate of five to seven times faster than the average yearly decline caused by normal ageing in people without the disease, according to researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health. Parkinson's sufferer Muhammad Ali. A study has revealed that a decline in quality of life starts years before the disease is diagnosed . Lead researcher Dr Natalia Palacios said: 'We observed a decline in physical . function in Parkinson’s patients relative to their healthy counterparts . beginning three years prior to diagnosis in men and 7.5 years prior to diagnosis in women. 'The . decline continues at a rate that is five to seven times faster than the . average yearly decline caused by normal ageing in individuals without . the disease. 'This . result provides support to the notion that the pathological process . leading to Parkinson’s disease may start several years before a . diagnosis.' The study is the first to examine patterns in the quality of life of Parkinson's patients prior to diagnosis and is published in the Journal of Parkinson’s Disease. The researchers studied 51,350 male health professionals enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow Up Study (HPFS) and 121,701 female registered nurses enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS). In both studies, participants filled out biannual questionnaires that documented the occurrence of major chronic disease by answering questions about a variety of lifestyle characteristics. The nurses study measured health-related quality of life in physical functioning; role limitations due to physical problems; role limitations due to emotional problems; vitality; bodily pain; social functioning; mental health; and general health perceptions. By contrast, the HPFS questionnaire only assessed physical functioning. Of the 454 men and 414 women identified with Parkinson’s, the researchers found that a decline began about three years before diagnosis for men and 7.5 years for women. Results also showed other measures of quality of life - available only in women - declined in a similar pattern. The scientists point out that their study is bolstered by the available data on both Parkinson’s patients and a healthy group used for comparison. Dr Palacios said: 'Our hope is that, with future research, biological markers of the disease process may be recognizable in this pre-clinical phase.'",Scientists observe decline in physical function in Parkinson’s patients three years prior to diagnosis in men and 7.5 years prior to diagnosis in women .

The boyfriend of former Stepping Hill poisoning suspect Rebecca Leighton was caught with child pornography when police stumbled on his disgusting crime while investigating his partner. Timothy Papworth, 29, searched the internet for the sick sexual images over an eight month period on a computer seized by chance from their flat last year, Manchester Crown Court heard. He was caught when police launched a dawn raid last July on the Stockport home he shared with nurse Miss Leighton. At the time she was suspected of fatally poisoning patients with spiked saline solution at the town's Stepping Hill hospital, where she worked as a nurse. Crime: Timothy Papworth, left, has admitted possessing child porn but it was only found after police raided the home he shared with Rebecca Leighton, right, who was suspected of being the Stepping Hill hospital poisoner . Charges against her were dropped last September after she had spent six weeks behind bars on remand. But she was later sacked for stealing the drug tramadol from the hospital. The sick images accessed in the couple’s flat above Mr Papworth’s darts shop in Heaviley, Stockport. The material is understood to have been downloaded from a file-sharing website. Papworth has pleaded guilty to possessing indecent photographs of children and has been ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register. Raid: Police found the sick images on a computer in the couple's flat above Mr Papworth's darts shop in Stockport, pictured . He admitted his guilt on the day a trial was due to begin, having previously denied accessing the material. Papworth admitted the charge on the basis that he searched the internet for the material five times and viewed it at least three times before deleting it. Luck: Rebecca Leighton was cleared of any involvement in the poisonings but the evidence taken from their home, pictured, helped convict her boyfriend . Judge Roger Thomas QC allowed Papworth’s unconditional bail to continue until sentencing later this year. 'This is very much a case that brings about the very real possibility of community sentencing and some positive therapeutic type sentence,' the judge told him. A probation report on Papworth was ordered before he appears for sentence on May 21. Registered nurse Victorino Chua, 46, of Stockport, is on bail after being arrested in connection with the Stepping Hill poisoning investigation. He was questioned on suspicion of three counts of murder and 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Six deaths in total have been linked to an insulin poisoner at the hospital. In total 21 patients thought to have been deliberately poisoned on wards A1, A2 or A3 – which care for seriously ill patients – between June 1 and July 15 last year. Nearly two weeks after it started the alarm was first raised by hospital staff when a higher than normal number of patients were reported to have 'unexplained' low blood sugar levels. Police have described the investigation as very complex - and are having to examine a bewildering 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluid. Officers are continuing to probe the deaths of multiple sclerosis sufferer Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, and Bill Dickson, 82, a former senior Daily Mail journalist, who all died after suffering ‘hypoglycaemic episodes’ – a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels. In January John Beeley, 73, and grandmother Linda McDonagh, 60, died and were then linked to the poisoner's campaign.","Timothy Papworth, 29, admitted having sick sexual images on a computer in the Stockport flat he shared with Rebecca Leighton .

Worrying evidence has emerged that the popular peanut butter sandwich can contain a common flame retardant. The chemical found is called HBCD - fire retardants are commonly used in the foam insulation of building walls. A study on 36 products purchased from grocery stores in Dallas, Texas, found that nearly half of the peanut butter as well as turkey, fish, beef and other fatty foods, contained the traces. Discovery: Worrying evidence has emerged that the popular peanut butter sandwich could contain fire retardants . The results were high on fatty foods because HBCDs are fat-soluble. The findings are concerning because it can take years for flame retardants to break down in the body. HBCDs make their way into the food chain via the air, water and soil, according to experts. In the case of peanut butter this may be due to the water that the peanut crops can be watered with. 'This is not good news. Here's yet another toxic chemical that can be found in many of the foods we buy at our supermarkets,' said Dr. Arnold Schecter of the University of Texas School of Public Health and an author of the study published on Thursday. Worrying: The chemical has even been discovered in umbilical cord blood . 'Food does not need to have flame retardants,' Dr Scheter said according to the Huffington Post. Chemicals that manufacturers use to try to reduce the flammability can be found of products such as  furniture, electronics, baby car seats and carpets. Two classes of flame . retardants called brominated and chlorinated have sparked the most worry, . ,Dr Schecter to Discovery News. This is because they build up in human tissues and also because they last for a long time. One exposed the . human body can take up to 219 days to break it down. Even more concerning was a discovery made by the Environmental Working Group. Sonya Lunder, a senior analyst said that the chemical has even been discovered in umbilical cord blood. 'Exposure starts before birth and may continue on in the diet for their entire life,' she told the website. Although individually the levels found in the study were not too concerning, the discovery of HBCD adds to growing evidence that food can be full of unwanted chemicals. Earlier this year, McDonald's altered the ingredients after the Jamie Oliver forced them to remove a processed food type that he labelled 'pink slime'. The food activist was shocked when he learned that ammonium hydroxide was being used by McDonald's to convert fatty beef offcuts into a beef filler for its burgers in the USA. 'Basically, we’re taking a product that would be sold at the cheapest form for dogs and after this process we can give it to humans' said the TV chef. It can be difficult to avoid flame retardants, but to reduce chemical exposures, frequent hand-washing is recommended. To reduce the amount consumed in food, experts suggest avoiding fatty foods.","Flame retardants are commonly used in the foam insulation of building walls .

Fears for the prospects of debt-stricken states on the Continent have seen sterling hit a three-and-a-half year high against the single currency. Bureaux de change reported a flood of demand yesterday from travellers and businessmen who are getting at least 1.20 euros to the pound. Handshake: Francois Hollande, left, with Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris yesterday. Mr Hollande's victory in the presidential election has been blamed for plunging the eurozone into turmoil . ‘This is a real bonus for our customers,’ said Peter Long, of TUI Travel, which owns the Thomson and First Choice holiday brands. Travelex, a currency specialist, was offering a rate of 1.208 euros to the pound yesterday – up 9 per cent on the 1.105 seen 12 months ago and a vast improvement on the December 2008 low when £1 bought just 1 euro. It means that £500 now buys 604 euros compared with 552 euros this time last year and the miserable 500 euros when the currencies were on a par with each other. Elvin Eldic, regional manager of Travelex UK, reported a flood of interest from Britons looking to swap their pounds for euros. Sharp rises: The exchange rate between the euro and the pound has reached its highest level for nearly four years . ‘The weekend’s elections in France and Greece have thrown the eurozone into fresh turmoil, driving the pound to a three-and-a-half year high against the euro,’ he said. ‘With the forecast remaining bleak here in the UK and another bank holiday weekend on the horizon for the Queen’s Jubilee, it’s a great opportunity for cash-strapped Brits to escape to sunnier climes without breaking the budget.’ Voters in both France and Greece rejected . governments that had signed up to austerity drives. Socialisit Francois . Hollande beat Nicolas Sarkozy in France on a tax-and-spend manifesto. More for your pound: Last July £1 was worth 1.10 euro - but now it is much closer to 1.25 . Cheaper: The improving exchange rate means that family holidays this summer to locations such as Malaga, pictured, will cost less . Bureaux de change also offering above 1.20 euros included the Post Office and Moneycorp. Most high street banks were offering less generous rates. Olann Kerrison of Moneycorp, which was offering just 1.075 euros to the pound last June, said: ‘Considering the euro was flirting with parity versus the pound less than a year ago, this latest market movement is not only great news for British holidaymakers, it’s also great timing as the holiday season approaches. A customer exchanging £500 can put an extra 50 euros in their pocket.’ Andrew Brown, head of travel money at the Post Office, said: ‘Holidaymakers visiting Post Office branches today will find that sterling now buys more euros than at any time since November 2008. ‘Our advice to travellers is to keep a close eye on the rates as their holiday approaches.’ Clem Chambers, of market information service ADVFN.com, said towering debts and a backlash against austerity were undermining the euro. He added: ‘It is little wonder the currency has reached a low against the pound not seen for three-and-a-half years. ‘Europe remains far from turning the tide of its fiscal and economic weaknesses.’ Analysts at currency firm Caxton FX think the pound could hit 1.30 euros within six months. One, Richard Driver, said: ‘The latest political developments from Greece and France have had an immediate impact on the euro and the long-term consequences are potentially disastrous for the single currency. ‘Sterling is gaining plenty of momentum thanks to its growing safe-haven status and considering the chronic instability within the eurozone, we could realistically see the pound hitting 1.30 euro mark by the autumn.","Travellers getting 1.20 euros to pound .

The Afghan government have accused the Taliban today of poisoning schoolgirls by bribing students and workers to sneak toxic chemicals into drinking water or spread it around school grounds. Officials have said that 15 suspects have now been arrested. They revealed that six schools in northern Takhar province had been affected in the past three weeks, and although they did not give a total number of girls who got sick, they said one school alone had 125 cases. When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, girls were banned from going to school and women were only allowed to leave their homes with a male relative as an escort. Shocking: The Afghan government have accused the Taliban of being behind six separate attacks on girls' schools . The Afghan government have made 15 arrests and claim that 12 of the suspects are Taliban insurgents . After their 2001 ouster, Taliban insurgents would attack schoolgirls by spraying their faces with acid. However, the group has appeared to tone down its stance against education for girls more recently. And Government officials suggested the . alleged plot may have been aimed at undermining the government's . achievements. President Hamid Karzai has called for an investigation . into the attacks. Meanwhile spokesman for the intelligence . service, Latifullah Mashal, said that his organisation had discovered a conspiracy by . militants to try to scare families from sending their children to . school. Marshal said: 'They want to create . terror and fear among students, especially in the education sector and . also in the health sector, which are two of the major achievements of . the 10 years of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.' He said that those currently being held . for the attacks include 12 identified Taliban insurgents, a teacher and a . school treasurer and his wife. Poisoned: A total of 160 girls aged between ten and 20 from the Aahan Dara Girls School were taken to hospital last month . Banned: Under Taliban rule girls were forbidden from going to school and some militants still attack female students . Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied any involvement in the poisonings. In an email he stated: 'The poisoning . of innocent children is against Islamic law. The mujahedeen are not . involved in the poisoning of schoolchildren. It is a crime.' Government officials had previously . said it was unclear what caused the series of outbreaks of illness at . girls' schools in the province starting about three weeks ago. In at least one case, doctors in the capital city of Taluqan attributed complaints of illness by 125 students to mass hysteria. But cases continued to mount and seven alleged school poisonings have now been reported in six schools in the province. Mustafa Rasouli, a spokesman for the . provincial government has told how the insurgents confessed to bribing . teachers, school workers and even students to sneak toxic chemicals onto . school grounds. In two cases, female students were . paid 50,000 Afghanis (almost $1,000) to contaminate water tanks at their . schools with a toxic powder. In other instances, conspirators sprayed a sweet-smelling yellow liquid around the grounds of the school, he said. Officials did not identify any of the toxic substances allegedly used.","The Afghan government have made 15 arrests for six attacks on girls' schools in three weeks .

Some psychologists say the stress is so crushing and the competition for spots in Manhattan's best institutions so cutthroat that parents are willing to move elsewhere. 'Parenting is a competitive sport. We’re trying to provide parents respite from that,' Dr. Lisa Spiegel, a downtown therapist who runs the Soho Parenting center, told the New York Post. Stress: Therapists say parents are cracking under pressure of getting their children into Manhattan's top schools . Spiegel said parents who seek her help often spend most of their 90-minute sessions talking about their fear of failing their children. One advice she offers her clients is avoiding some of the more competitive mothers - the kind that fret over bringing the right designer bag on a school tour. Dana Haddad, a New York admissions consultant, said her client meetings sometimes resemble a session with a psychoanalyst, or a fashion consultant. Haddad revealed that one family was so nervous about school interviews that she was asked to pick out the tie for the father. A common question that admissions specialists face is whether parents should dress their toddlers in suits for the big interview. Best: Families face tough competition when trying to secure a spot in Manhattan's top institutions, such as the Marymount School . In a more extreme turn, Haddad said one pregnant client asked about inducing early labor so that her newborn could be considered for kindergarten before the September 1 deadline. In another case, Haddad said a single mother pretended to be a lesbian in an effort to make her child's application stand out. The pressure of getting their children into good schools can prove too much not only for the parents' psyche, but also for their marriage, according to counselors. A Manhattan psychologist said a mother was so distraught when her nervous husband made a slightly inappropriate joke during a school tour that she turned on him during a session.","Pregnant woman considered inducing early labor to secure a kindergarten slot for her newborn .

"Becky Edwards from Cannock, Staffs. was so humiliated after becoming wedged in children's ride she lost more than half bodyweight . Supermarket worker Becky used Safeway discount card to stock up on pies and crisps . By . Deborah Andrews . PUBLISHED: . 05:13 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 17 May 2012 . A mother-of-two was shamed into losing more than 18 stone after getting stuck on a theme park ride.Becky Edwards was left a laughing stock when she became wedged in a carriage ride while enjoying a day out with her family three years ago. The 30-year-old from Cannock, Staffordshire, was so humiliated by her mishap that it forced her to change her unhealthy lifestyle - and lose more than half her body weight. She said: 'It was the most embarrassing day of my life. Everyone was staring at me. People were laughing and pointing at me. 'In a way, I'm glad it happened. I don't think I would have done anything about my weight otherwise.' 'It was the most embarrassing day of my life': Becky will never forget the moment she became stuck in a theme park ride . Healthy: Supermarket worker Becky once used her discount card to buy pork pies and sweets - now she eats low fat foods and grills instead of fries . Becky, who is a full-time mother, ballooned to a dress size 32 and a whopping 33 stone after years of gorging on junk food. She said: 'It started when I was in my late teens and I moved out of home into my own flat. I stopped eating proper meals. 'I got a job in Safeway and used my discount card to buy crisps, chocolates and cream cakes every day. I would stuff myself. 'I was working shifts and on my way home from work, I'd stop off at the chip shop.' On an average day, Becky would eat three bags of crisps, two chocolate bars, sandwiches, a pizza, sausage rolls, pork pies and Cornish pasties. Her weight spiralled out of control after she met husband Gary, 34, a factory worker, and gave birth to their daughter Lilly, now six. Becky said: 'When Lilly was a toddler, I started dieting. I tried different things - Weight Watchers, Slimfast - but nothing worked for me. 'I was always hungry and would fill up on anything I could grab. I was probably eating the same amount. 'I just got it into my head that I would never lose weight. I just thought ‘that's me' and hid myself in baggy clothes. 'I didn't own a full length mirror. I didn't want to see myself.' It wasn't until the day out at Drayton Manor Theme Park in Staffordshire that Becky got the wake-up call she needed. She said: 'Lilly was only three at the time and she wanted to go on every ride. I always avoided them.'I used to come up with excuses but she begged me to go on the cars with her. I didn't like seeing her upset so I gave in. Super mum: Thirty-three stone Becky Edwards was humiliated into losing more than half her body weight after getting stuck on a roller coaster at Drayton Manor theme park. 'As we went round, the wheel was cutting into my stomach. It was very uncomfortable. 'When the ride finished, I tried to stand up but I realised I was stuck. 'Lilly sat there waiting for me to get off. She shouted: ‘come on Mum, hurry up.' She wanted to go on the other rides. She was young and didn't understand what was happening. 'It was so embarrassing. My biggest fear was that they would have to call the fire brigade to cut me out.' After several minutes, Becky finally managed to free herself. She said: 'It felt like I was stuck forever. 'I grabbed Lilly's hand and walked towards Gary. There was a crowd of people looking at me.'I was hot and my face was bright red. 'Gary had seen everything but he knew it was best not to mention anything. We never talked about my weight. I think he was worried about upsetting me. 'After that, I refused to go on any more rides.' Liberating: Now Becky says she can go on any children's rides she likes . On the journey home, Becky tried to make a joke out of her misfortune. She said: 'I laughed it off. I said it was a kid's ride and adults shouldn't go on it but I was struggling to hold back the tears. 'As soon we got home though, I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. It really upset me. 'I hated my body and was ashamed at how fat I'd let myself get.' She also realised that her bad relationship with food could have fatal health implications. 'I was always breathless and at risk of having a heart attack. 'I'd cook a healthy meal for Lilly and Gary but I wouldn't eat it myself. I was setting a bad example. 'I decided I needed to do something if I wanted to see her grow up. I didn't want to leave her without a mum.' Becky joined her local Slimming World group and within a month she had lost a stone and a half.She said: 'You can eat what you want but you change how you cook things. I don't use oil and I grill everything. 'Anne my Slimming World leader has been brilliant. When I'm struggling she will always helps me. The group is like one big family. We all look after each other. 'When I fell pregnant with my son Harry, I had a break from Slimming World and put on two stone but as soon as he was born, I was back again.' In total, dropped nine dress sizes and has slimmed down to a healthier 14 stone. She hopes to lose a further two stone to reach her target. Becky says she still has flashbacks to that day but it hasn't stopped her going to the theme park. She said: 'We went to Drayton Manor a couple of weeks ago and I went on everything. 'Lilly said to me the other day: ‘You used to be fat, Mummy, but now you're not.' 'It made me feel so proud.'","Becky Edwards from Cannock, Staffs. was so humiliated after becoming wedged in children's ride she lost more than half bodyweight .

The director behind the actor's hits Top Gun and Days of Thunder jumped from the Vincent Thomas Bridge in LA yesterday. The 68-year-old is understood to have been diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer. 'Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him,' Cruise, who was pictured leaving Madeos restaurant in LA last night looking sober, said in a statement. Shock: Tom Cruise leaves Madeos restaurant just hours after friend and Top Gun director Tony Scott died . Devastated: The actor today offered his condolences to Scott's family . The Top Gun team: Jerry Bruckheimer, Cruise, Kelly McGillis and Scott at an event in 2010 . 'My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time.' He described Scott as 'a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.' The British-born director, who is the . younger brother of filmmaker Ridley Scott, jumped from the bridge in California at . around 12.30pm on Sunday, authorities confirmed. According to the Los Angeles Times, investigators found a note in Scott's black Toyota Prius, which was parked on the bridge. The note had contact information, with a suicide note found later in his office. Cruise worked with Scott both on Top Gun and 1990's Days Of Thunder, and worked with brother Ridley on 1985's Legend. The aviation blockbuster was a huge hit for Scott and Cruise . Cruise was recently spotted at Nevada's Naval Air Station, believed to be part of research for a potential Top Gun sequel. It was unclear whether Scott was ever signed on for the follow -up. Scott was drafted in late to direct 1986's Top Gun. When . Scott first heard about the project he was involved with another film, . Man On Fire, and Paramount had alternative director in mind for the . story about an elite fighter pilot training school. Fortunately, Top Gun producers Don . Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer wanted him after seeing his work on a . glossy commercial about a jet plane, agreed to direct the movie. Close friends: Tony Scott and Tom Cruise on the set of Days of Thunder . It became one of the highest-grossing films of 1986, taking in more than $176 million at the box office, and putting Cruise on the map as a Hollywood A-lister. In the movie Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, a young Naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. He and his 'wingman Nick Goose' Bradshaw win places to train at the Navy's Fighter Weapons School. The film depicts Maverick's progress through the training, his romance with a female instructor (Kelly McGillis), his overcoming a crisis of confidence following a fatal training accident, and the killing of several enemy pilots of unlisted nationality in a dogfight. The pair tried to recreate the Top Gun magic with 1990's Days of Thunder . Featuring F-14 Fighter Jets, super bikes and an evocative soundtrack the film was not critically well received, but its public acclaim meant Scott became hot property. Scott and Cruise tried to recreate the magic four years later with Days of Thunder. The cast also included Nicole Kidman, Robert Duvall and Randy Quaid and featured appearances by real life NASCAR racers, such as Rusty Wallace and Neil Bonnett. It received mixed reviews from critics who were not impressed by the special effects and plot with some describing the film as 'Top Gun on wheels' or 'Top Gun in Race Cars!'. However, Scott was able to answer any critics after securing another  financial success with the film which once again earned Paramount more than $150million at the box office. Showbiz Roundup!

Mr Obama grinned while having his picture taken with a gawky college student after the President stopped by The Sink, a student bar, while in Denver, Colorado. It was there he met University of Colorado student Madalyn Starkey, who's slack-jawed Instagram photo has become an instant internet classic. Scroll down for videos . The Greatest? Madalyn Starkey poses with President Barack Obama in a Boulder, Colorado dive bar . 'I’m not going to stand there with a smile and my lips all quivering. Of course I’m going to throw my excitement out there in a picture,' Starkey said to CBS. She said that she intended to send the photo to her parents, but uploaded it to the web on a whim. 'He was kind of making his way around quickly but I just took a picture with him and then of course, afterwards I said to him, ‘Oh, you smell nice’ the most embarrassing thing,' Starkey said. On the same day, another University of Colorado student met the POTUS and managed to knock yoghurt all over his pants. Kolbi . Zerbest, 19, was among the supporters gathered to meet the president . outside a college restaurant in Boulder, Colorado when the purple snack . spewed over his leg. Speaking on the Today show . on Wednesday, the college freshman said scrambling photographers had . actually knocked over the yoghurt, adding: 'Honestly, more of it got on . me.' 'Embarrassed': Kolbi Zerbest, 19, explained that her yoghurt spilled on President Obama during a meeting with students in Boulder, Colorado after scrambling paparazzi knocked it over . The president remained good humoured about the accident, jokingly demanding to know who was responsible before pointing out it was lucky none had spilled on the Secret Service. 'Whose yoghurt is on me?' he asked, reaching for a napkin from a Secret Service agent. 'You've got a good story to tell. You can say: ""I spilled yoghurt all over the president"".' Zerbest, standing with two friends in the crowd, responded: 'I'm very embarrassed of that story. But it's a pleasure - the pleasure is all mine. I'm very sorry sir.' Caught on camera as he wiped his trousers, Obama added: 'Getting it on the president is alright but on the Secret Service...' Oops!

Whose is it? With Secret Service agents looking on, Obama speaks to Zerbest after she apologises . Speaking on the Today show, Miss Zerbest explained the accident was actually the fault of fumbling paparazzi, and added that she was surprised the president had stopped for such a lengthy chat. 'We were just waiting there patiently, and then he came down this line of people, and... we knew we’d eventually get to shake his hand,' Miss Zerbest, speaking from Denver, explained. 'As he comes towards us a little bit more, paparazzi come rushing behind us and right as I’m shaking his hand the paparazzi kicks the bowl that I had placed on the ground onto the president. 'It was mine, so, obviously I took the blame for it... Technically it was my fault that I’d placed it there - but I’m not one who spilled it on him or kicked it on him.' Laughing it off: A video shows Zerbest in the crowd as President Obama gets into his armoured vehicle . Fan: Zerbest said she was surprised that the president stopped for a chat after the unfortunate accident . Zerbest told Msnbc that it was actually a 'Rush Bowl' - blended fruit and yoghurt with granola. She said that there 'wasn't a lot' of yoghurt on the president. 'Honestly, more of it got on me, the ground, and on the Secret Service,' she said, adding: 'It got on his trousers a little bit, though.' She added that she was surprised when the president stopped for a chat about the incident. 'I just expected him to shrug it off, try to clean it up a little bit and just get on with walking to his car to leave,' she said. 'So it was pretty exciting being able to talk to him for a minute or two to try to exchange what just happened.' Unforgettable: Obama recounted the incident as he spoke to University of Colorado students later on Tuesday . Obama was in Boulder to speak at the University of Colorado about his proposal for low-rate student loans. The speech was part of a two-day, three-state swing through college campuses. Before the yoghurt incident, the president ordered a pizza and posed for pictures with students inside the popular student bar, The Sink, for about 20 minutes. He recounted the event to a 10,800 strong crowd during his speech later in the day. 'A woman got very excited and spilled yogurt on me,' he joked to the students. 'Or hazardously, she spilled yogurt on the Secret Service. The agent just stood there, looking at her.' See below for videos .

These futuristic graphics look more like something from a Star Trek film than pictures of a shopping centre. But the astonishing images are in fact an artist's impression of the future Westfield mega-mall at the World Trade Center in New York. The Australian company has announced  that they will open a retail centre at the iconic site 13-and-a-half years after the September 11 attacks. Futuristic: An artist's impression of the Westfield shopping mall at the World Trade Center in New York . Enormous: A total shopping space of 352,000 sq feet would be spread over three above-ground levels and two below ground . Westfield, who has shopping centres in London's Shepherd's Bush and at the Olympic site in Stratford, has spent years negotiating the terms of the New York contract. But this week they signed a deal with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for a $1.25 billion joint venture to lease the retail space at the World Trade Center. And potential tenants of the rebuilt got a sneak preview at what the new retail area may look like during a trade conference in Las Vegas on Monday. Developers say that the new shopping centre will have a range of upmarket restaurants as well as all the major US international brands . Planning: Shops will be housed in 4 World Trade Center, which is under construction, and inside 3 World Trade Center, which is still in the planning stage . Westfield Co-Chief Executive Peter Lowy said 352,000 sq feet of shopping would be spread over three above-ground levels and two below ground. Westfield is also entitled to operate another 90,000 sq feet of retail space among the 8.8 million sq feet of office space under construction. At the International Council of Shopping Centers annual convention Mr Lowy explained how Westfield planned to be selective about possible tenants. He said: 'We're going to do something that no one can imagine.' Under construction: A bird's eye view of what the World Trade Center looks like now. Westfield plans to open the shopping mall by 2015 . A London Westfield shopping centre pictured next to a current picture of the World Trade Center: The project could be finished in three years .

Westfield say that the stores will cater not only to the people who will live and work at the World Trade Center, but also to the masses of tourists who visit the National September 11 Memorial Park and Museum, as well as the proposed performing arts center. 'We have to design the retail to suit the customer,' Lowy said. He said he expects tenants to be a mix of upscale food shops, a 'very good' supermarket and other U.S. and international retailers.

Most of the retail will be inside the Transportation Hub, a central stop for 13 train lines. Westfield operated the hugely successful underground mall at the World Trade Center before selling its interest to the Port Authority after the September 11, 2001, attacks. In February, an independent audit ordered by the governors of New York and New Jersey, who share control of the authority, found that the cost of the World Trade Center redevelopment had soared by $3.8 billion to $14.8 billion.

John Nale, a lawyer who led the effort to raise the reward money from local residents and businesses said: 'To the person or persons responsible for her disappearance, we ask that you now come forward, accept responsibility for what you have done, show us that you are human and relieve yourself, Ayla's family and this community of this burden.' Ayla was 20 months old when she was reported missing December 17 from her father's home in Waterville. The toddler had last been seen wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them. She had a cast on her broken left arm. Steve McCausland, spokesman for the .

He added: 'There will be more searches, more dives and more interviews. And we are in this for the long haul. This case will never close until Ayla is found.' Before the news conference, detectives called Ayla's parents to deliver the somber news that they no longer believe she'll be found alive. Asked if police believe a crime was committed, Mr McCausland said: 'We believe foul play has been involved ... this is a criminal investigation.'

Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro, told police he was thankful for the information, Mr McCausland said, adding, 'His reaction was no reaction.' Mr DiPietro has said he thinks Ayla was abducted, but police say there's no evidence of that. No arrests have been made in the case. State police confirmed that Ayla's blood was found in Mr DiPietro's house and said he, his girlfriend and his sister - who were there the night Ayla disappeared - know more than they're telling police. Police repeated that assertion on Thursday when asked about the father. 'We believe he knows more than he's told us,' Mr McCausland said.

There was no answer when a reporter knocked on DiPietro's door. After Ayla was reported missing, dozens of game wardens, FBI agents and local and state police officers participated in the search in this central Maine city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state capital, Augusta. Police checked trash bins and FBI agents knocked on doors. Officials even went so far as to drain a stream so wardens could get a better look. Denial: Mr DiPietro, 24, says that he is not involved in his daughter Ayla's disappearance, but police believe he's not telling them the full story . Recently, divers searched the Kennebec River and retrieved some items. Investigators declined to comment on those items Thursday. Investigators said that they have received more than 1,100 tips and that people shouldn't expect it to be solved overnight, Mr McCausland said. 'This isn't 'CSI' where everything is solved in 60 minutes,' he said.

This is not a good time to be a duck with a fatty liver in California, though better times lie just ahead. Chefs are loading their high-end menus with duck liver: terrine de foie gras, seared foie gras with mango chutney, foie gras salad and sweet foie gras for dessert. And they are keeping secret the locations of their multi-course dinners to avoid protesters as a July 1 ban looms in California, the only state to outlaw foie gras. Scroll down for video . Cramming in: High-end restaurants in California are squeezing in as much foie gras into their menus as possible ahead of a state-wide ban; here, a carrot soup topped with foie gras cream at Sent Sovi . Liver alone: Foie Gras is torched and made into a brulee at Sent Sovi Friday; the culinary treat will be banned on July 1 . Demand for the delicacy created by force-feeding ducks through funnel-like tubes has never been higher as diners sate their palates with a product that soon will be banned for production and sale in the Golden State. 'The price has doubled. People are finding it hard to get it because the demand is so high,' said Tracy Lee of the San Jose-based traveling dining service Dishcrawl, which has organized a series of 15 secret, sold-out foie gras dinners. Her last one is Thursday. While gourmands stockpile foie gras at $60 a pound, others are stomaching the frenetic food fest with disdain. 'High-end foodies and chefs stuffing down their throats excessive amounts of fatty liver from force-fed ducks in the run-up to the ban paint a pretty ironic picture,' said Jennifer Fearing of the Humane Society of the United States. As the California foie gras feeding frenzy escalates, protesters in San Francisco and Los Angeles are staking out restaurants and even making reservations to tie up seats at dinners they know they'll never attend. 'Many people don't know what foie gras . is or how it's produced and they're horrified when we tell them,' said . Dana Portnoy, who shot undercover video inside a foie gras operation and . organizes the San Francisco-area protests. ' Prep work: Chef and owner Josiah Slone, right, prepares a foie gras dish at Sent Sovi; renegade chefs across the state are loading their menus with the fatty duck liver . Duckadent: Guests enjoy a foie gras dish at the restaurant . Delicious dish: The food will be banned because of the cruel way in which foie gras must be prepared . Occasionally we'll run into antagonistic patrons, but that's usually when we're protesting at the foie gras benefit dinners.' It's why Lee doesn't publicize the restaurants where her dinners will be held until a day before the date. 'So far we haven't had any protesters, which has been nice,' she said. The California legislature gave the state's only producer, Sonoma Artisan Foie Gras, more than seven years to come up with a cruelty-free way to fatten the duck's liver when in 2004 it voted in the ban on producing and selling foie gras. Absent that, a coalition of chefs have mounted a lobbying campaign to try to overturn the law in the future, and the foie gras dinners are funding that on-going effort. Force-fed: A farmer in France force feeds grain to a duck as part of the traditional process to fatten its liver for foie gras . A mallard of life and death: Geese wait for their midday feed where they are force-fed to enlarge their livers; Israel and the Czech Republic have banned the practice . To the oohs and aaahs of about 30 diners, Chef Josiah Slone hosted a recent seven-course foie gras feast at his Sent Sovi restaurant in Saratoga. He started with arugula with foie gras vinaigrette, moved to foie gras mousse with tartufata and English peas and seared foie gras with savoury rhubarb pie. For dessert: foie, peanut butter and chocolate. Foie gras - French for 'fatty liver' - . is made from liver swollen to 10 times its normal size, which the . lawsuit argues is acute hepatic lipidosis, a condition linked to obesity . in animals. Ducks' livers become so engorged by the feeding process . called 'gavage' that the birds can't walk and have trouble breathing. Gavage has been outlawed in a dozen . countries including Israel, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, . Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 'For me, it was more of an educational dinner to talk a little about how foie gras is produced and the science behind how it's produced,' Slone said. 'Yes there are two sides to it, but understanding the line between science and emotion is very important for people.' There are enough 'quality ingredients out there' that his California-French menu won't be lacking when it's gone, Slone said. As someone who goes to extreme measures to source quality meat and vegetables, he thinks animal welfare advocates could end more suffering if they'd focus on practices at large confined animal farming operations producing beef, chicken and pork. 'I think the issue that the animal rights people have is a lot bigger than foie gras,' Slone said. 'Foie gras was sort of an easy target, sort of low-hanging fruit. 'But in the sense of improving conditions of animal welfare, ending some of the factory farming practices that big ag is defending is a very admirable goal.' The California ban, which maintains that over-feeding ducks using a pipe stuffed down the esophagus is cruel, comes as four animal welfare groups filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture last month, making another point about foie gras. They hope to secure a national prohibition by arguing that USDA is violating the Poultry Products Inspection Act by allowing 'diseased birds' to enter the food chain.

"By . Nick Enoch . UPDATED: . 06:22 EST, 3 January 2012 . A High . Court judge told of his 'frustration' after an Arab prince failed to appear at a court hearing to settle a dispute over an alleged secret marriage with an . Egyptian model. Nivin . el-Gamal, 35, told Mr Justice Bodey yesterday that she married Sheikh Ahmed . bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman of Emirates Airlines, at a ceremony in . London four years ago. She wants . the judge to rule that a marriage took place, declare it null and void and . therefore put her in a position to claim maintenance. But just moments before Sheikh Ahmed, whose airline sponsors Arsenal, was due to give evidence, his lawyer claimed his client had been ordered to stay in . Dubai by the country's ruler to attend a political meeting. Nivin el-Gamal (pictured outside the High Court . yesterday), 35, told Mr Justice Bodey that she married Sheikh Ahmed bin . Saeed al-Maktoum (seen right at site of an Emirates hotel project in Australia) at a ceremony in London four years ago . His counsel Martin . Pointer QC said he was 'unable to attend' as he had 'no practical choice' but to attend the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit (GCC) in Riyadh. Sheikh . Ahmed, who is a member of the royal family of Dubai, has denied the claim made by Miss el-Gamal and said no ceremony . took place. Mr . Pointer said the case would continue without his client's . oral evidence. The judge . said: 'Why . is it suddenly sprung on the court on Monday morning seconds before he comes . into the witness box? 'Provision could have been . made for a video link.' 'He . is unable to attend to give evidence,' said Mr Pointer. 'He has been . recalled by the ruler of Dubai to attend the GCC meeting in Riyadh.' Mr Pointer . added: 'My client intends no disrespect at all to your lordship by not . being here.' Richard Todd QC for Miss el-Gamal who claims she married the Sheikh in a . secret ceremony in January 2007 said it was 'a very dramatic development . indeed'. He added: 'We are frankly . dumbfounded by this turn of events.' Mr Pointer, who said the Sheikh would not now be coming to England to give . evidence, then began his final legal submissions claiming there was 'no . evidence' that the 'marriage' ever took place, apart from the 'self-serving evidence' from Miss el-Gamal. Sheikh Ahmed's lawyer claimed that his client had been ordered by his uncle, the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum (above), to attend a summit in Riyadh . There was no independent record and no evidence from the Imam who was said to . have conducted the service or from the witnesses who were said to be there. Last week, Miss el-Gamal was branded a liar . who invented the 'marriage' in a bid to get £1million a year . maintenance from him. In . what Mr Todd described as 'the case of the Prince and the . pauper', she is seeking a declaration that the 'marriage' should be declared null and void. But the Sheikh . denies they were ever married although they did meet for sex and have a . three-year-old son born in the U.S. in April 2008. The Sheikh, worth an . estimated £19billion, is the uncle of Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin . Rashid. Mr Pointer claimed she was only an 'irregular' sexual . partner of the Sheikh and 'had a fantasy that he would marry you'. But Miss el-Gamal . claims she bought a traditional wedding dress from Harrods in 2003 to have . pictures taken of the occasion - although because it was a secret wedding he told . her to dress simply, and the dress hung in her wardrobe for years. Mr Todd told Mr Justice Bodey that the Sheikh also gave her a . £30,000 dowry and 34,000 Egyptian pounds to buy a gold wedding ring with 17 . diamonds. He also gave her a Bulgari watch. But he added that . after they split up, she was living on benefits of £110 a week and had to . sell the ring and watch to make ends meet. He said the Sheikh had since been making interim maintenance payments to her . and their son. Mr Todd said the couple first met in . Dubai in 2003. Their relationship ended at the beginning of 2005 but they met . again in April 2006 and resumed their relationship. The daughter of a prominent Egyptian businessman said the Sheikh first claimed . he asked her to marry him in a telephone call from Dubai, and they married in . December 2006. But later she changed the marriage date to January 11, 2007 at . his flat in Lowndes Square, Knightsbridge. Mr Pointer said to her in the witness box: 'You were not his girlfriend . were you? You just met irregularly and had sex together.' But she insisted: 'No we had a relationship.' Sheikh Ahmed is chairman of Emirates Airlines, which sponsors Arsenal . But when Mr Pointer said they never went out in London, to the theatre , cinema . , or to parties or dinner parties , she said it was their culture that men had . a 'separate life' to their women, who did as they were told. She said that was why she never wore the wedding dress she brought to the . wedding ceremony, because he wanted it kept secret and told her to dress . simply. She claims the . marriage took place before an Imam and two witnesses at his flat after he told . her 'he was really in love with me and wanted to get married'. She claimed in a witness statement that the . witnesses had signed a paper after the marriage. But when Mr Pointer said this . was a lie, she admitted it was 'untrue'. Mr . Pointer claimed they only met up for sex 'after which he gave you sums of . money'. She said he did give her money and gifts but she also bought him gifts because . of the relationship they had. She denied seeing other men . She claimed she bought the Sheikh a . number of gifts including a £7,000 Louis Vuitton diamond necklace, a £24,000 . Cartier watch, cufflinks, pyjamas from Harrods and a coffee machine. Miss el-Gamal admitted . she had one other boyfriend while they were apart between 2005 and 2006. She . said she had a lot of friends but no other sexual relationships during this . time. She also maintained she was still a Muslim after Mr Pointer said . she was now following the Jewish religion Kabbalah. Nivin el-Gamal claims she bought a wedding dress from Harrods in 2003 to have pictures taken for her 'marriage'. She also claims to have bought Sheikh Ahmed a number of gifts, including pyjamas from the store . Mr Todd told the judge she believed . she had gone through a proper and valid marriage with the Sheikh. But the relationship broke down in 2008 after he announced he was marrying a . cousin in Dubai. She claims he telephoned her in July 2008 and did a Talak . divorce [by repeating the phrase 'I divorce you' three times] over the telephone saying they were now divorced. Miss el-Gamal claimed the marriage ceremony took about 30 minutes before the Imam. She . said two people who worked for him acted as witnesses. But nothing was written . down because he wanted it kept secret. The judge said the question for him was not whether it was valid , because it . was not under English law, but whether anything happened at all. If . there was no marriage then it would have financial consequences for Miss el-Gamal. Mr Todd said it was her belief that they were married under Islam and that it . would be recognised as valid in English law. The judge commented if it did . not meet the requirements of English law it would be a void marriage. He . also commented on the 'eye-watering' legal costs being run up by the . case. The judge is only being asked to decide whether there was a . marriage at this stage. All questions of maintenance will be dealt with at . further hearings next year. Lawyers . are due to conclude legal argument at a hearing in London tomorrow and expect . the judge to make a decision in the next few days.","Model Nivin el-Gamal wants prince to pay maintenance for her and their three-year-old son .

Fred Goodwin and other former senior officers at the Royal Bank of Scotland are facing a £2.4billion legal claim from furious investors. The former RBS chief executive is just one of 17 former directors due to receive claims letters today from the RBoS Shareholders Action Group. They are accused of glossing over the . dire financial health of the company when it went cap in hand to . shareholders to raise money in April 2008. Pressure: Former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin and ex-chairman Tom McKillop (right) are among bosses who will receive claim letters from shareholders demanding compensation for 'misrepresenting information' The bank was later bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money, just months after the £12billion rights issue. Investors suffered huge losses, with the . bank’s share price slumping from a high of 607p in March 2007 to just . 25.37p yesterday. The action is being taken by the RBoS . Shareholders Action Group, which sent a letter to RBS and a small group . of former directors yesterday. The group represents almost 7,500 private . shareholders and powerful institutional investors including Deutsche . Bank. Also being sued: Former group finance director Guy Whittaker and ex-head . of investment banking Johnny Cameron (right) are also being blamed for . an alleged cover-up that forced shareholders to pay out £12bn . It alleges that there was 'an . incredible cover-up' at the bank, which maintained it was not short of . cash and even allegedly concealed a loan from the U.S. government. London lawyers Bird & Bird will . today send letters to the bank, Mr Goodwin, former chairman Sir Tom . McKillop, former head of investment banking Johnny Cameron and the . former finance director Guy Whittaker, among others. 2012 did not get off to a great start for Fred Goodwin. On January 31, he joined the ranks of . Robert Mugabe and  Nicolae Ceausescu by being stripped of his knighthood . - after the Forfeiture Committee decided his actions had brought the . system . into disrepute. And last month, Mr Goodwin resigned as a . trustee of the Queen’s personal charity to avoid further embarrassment . to the Royal Family. The . shamed banker, who was once a regular visitor to Balmoral, quit the . Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust just days after his honour was annulled. Mr . Goodwin, who led the Royal Bank of Scotland to the verge of collapse, . became the public face of the banking disaster which plunged Britain . into recession and cost taxpayers billions. He quit his role as chairman of the Prince’s Trust in 2009 in the wake of public anger over the bailout of RBS. But his role since 2004 as one of six . trustees of the Queen’s personal charity, which distributes money to . good causes, did not emerge until last year. A number of other professional bodies have considered stripping Mr Goodwin of fellowships they awarded him. These include the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Investors allege RBS hid the truth . about its desperate finances, including the fact that it had taken out a . loan from the U.S. Federal Reserve, when it asked for the cash. They also claim that Mr Goodwin, who . was stripped of his knighthood in January, had publicly denied the need . for a rights issue, stating only two months earlier: 'There are no plans . for any inorganic capital raisings or anything of the sort.' Shares in the bank were changing hands . at 200p at the time of the rights issue, but by October that year they . had plummetted to just 65.5p. The . following December RBS received its first £20billion government . bailout, and it got a further injection of £25billion in taxpayers' money 12 months later. The huge rescue bailouts and collapse in share price left shareholders significantly out of pocket. Despite . concluding that RBS's near collapse was due to poor management, the . Financial Services Authority did not take action against Mr Goodwin or . any other of the bank's directors. Nevertheless, the shamed bank boss, who quit on a bumper pension, was stripped of his knighthood. Action group coordinator Mike Neill . told The Sun: 'We are anxious to get Mr Goodwin and others into a . witness box to ask them certain questions. 'There is tremendous anger and absolute hatred. 'They didn't give us information - it was an incredible cover-up.' The . group is backed by 7,400 private shareholders and 80 institutional . investors, including Collins Stewart, Deutsche Bank, SG Hambro, Credit . Agricole, and HSBC Global Custody. A spokesman for RBS told the Independent that the group has 'substantial and credible legal and factual defences' to the claims. The bank will 'defend itself vigorously', the spokesman added.","Investor group alleges 'incredible cover-up' after bank demanded £12bn from shareholders months before bailout .

Statement: Kate and Christopher Hollis accusing a coroner of 'compounding' their grief by banning their lawyer from asking key questions . The parents of a baby killed by a falling lamppost spoke of their fury yesterday after a coroner ordered a jury to rule his death was an accident. Kate and Christopher Hollis accused her of 'compounding' their grief by banning their lawyer from asking key questions. Tommy Hollis suffered fatal head injuries when the lamppost fell on to his pushchair five days after a workman cut through a supporting metal plate. He died in hospital 48 hours later, on the eve of his first birthday. Mr and Mrs Hollis said they felt 'let down' by coroner Elizabeth Pygott, who they said refused to let their lawyer call witnesses from the council involved or question the workman. They had asked the coroner to give the jury the option of returning a verdict of unlawful killing, or an open verdict. But Mrs Pygott said the jury could only return a verdict of accidental death because there was not enough evidence to support anything else. Outside the inquest, Mrs Hollis, 40, a senior lawyer at finance firm GE Capital, said: 'We came here knowing it would be an extremely challenging time for us. 'However, we did not expect our upset and anguish to be compounded by what we feel was the coroner’s decision to exclude from consideration questions and evidence that might lead us to better understand how our son, Tommy, was killed. Portrait: Mr Hollis and his wife Chris with their son Thomas who was killed by a lamppost which fell on top of his pram after its foundations were inadvertently severed . Happy family: Tommy laughs during a photo shoot with his mother, Kate, and father, Chris . 'We feel let down that crucial witnesses were not called or declined to answer questions.' Mr Hollis, 42, a pilot, and his wife, who live in Chiswick, had a second son, Jack, born last September. Their lawyer Sally Moore, from law firm Leigh Day & Co, said the couple would launch legal action against those responsible for Tommy’s death. She claimed the inquest had missed questions including why no ‘qualified engineer’ was supervising the workman. The inquest heard workers were under pressure from the local council, the London Borough of Hounslow, to complete a road-widening project in Chiswick, West London, before voting began for the 2010 general election at the nearby town hall. Tragedy: Nanny Mary Gregory lies behind Tommy's buggy in Chiswick, West London . A police officer removes the pram from the scene: Anna Martin said she was wheeling the sleeping toddler past roadworks when she heard a 'hollow' noise followed by a 'terrible scream' Kevin Elmore admitted cutting the plate and was found guilty of gross misconduct by his employer, construction firm McNicholas, and given a written warning. He told police: 'If I could take the place of that child, then I would.' Tommy was struck by the lamppost while his nanny Anna Martin waited to cross the road at traffic lights. Mary Gregory, 62, was also hit as she pushed her granddaughter Poppy in a pram next to Tommy. But Mrs Pygott said she would not invoke her powers to issue recommendations that councils should check the safety of lampposts because it would be expensive and 'burdensome'. She said: 'If I had thought there was any real evidence to support manslaughter or unlawful killing as a reasonable verdict, I would have felt obliged to refer it back to the Crown Prosecution Service or the police, and I don’t think that’s the case.' She told the jury: 'The only conclusion I am in fact going to leave to you is that of accidental death. 'The issue of statutory liability for health and safety matters is not for this court and I do not consider that there is any evidence of a gross error that could give rise to any other conclusion, be it neglect, negligence or indeed unlawful killing.' But she left the door open for the family to launch civil action over the death. Respect: A couple look at flowers laid at the scene. Nanny Miss Martin tried to revive the little boy with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but he never regained consciousness . A London Borough of Hounslow spokesman said: 'We would never compromise safety by placing pressure on council officers or contractors to rush to complete work.' This is not the first time Mrs Pygott has faced criticism over a ruling. In November 2005, she ruled that Jessica Palmer, 34, who was killed by a blood infection days after giving birth, died from natural causes. This was despite a midwife’s admission that at least one 'gross mistake' was made in the mother’s treatment. And in 2003 she came under fire for holding the inquest of Holby City actress Laura Sadler, who plunged 40ft from a balcony after a drugs and drinks binge, without listing it so the public and press could attend, as is standard practice. She later said this was an oversight.","Kate and Christopher Hollis accused coroner of 'compounding' their grief .

"By . Jack Doyle and Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 19:46 EST, 7 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:52 EST, 8 June 2012 . Controversial: Tom Winsor, pictured, author of two reports calling for radical reform of police pay and conditions, has been selected for the role of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary . Leaders of rank-and-file police reacted with fury last night to the decision to appoint a civilian to be their chief watchdog. The Police Federation – which is fighting threats to pay and perks – said the selection of Tom Winsor as Chief Inspector of Constabulary ‘beggared belief’. The former rail regulator wrote two reports proposing a radical shake-up of policing which caused deep resentment among officers. Mr Winsor endorsed a normal retirement age of 60 and the scrapping of a series of allowances and special payments. And he has proposed officers who work anti-social hours should be paid more. He also said chief constables should have the power to make officers redundant. On Thursday he was named as the Home Office’s preferred candidate to replace Sir Denis O’Connor and was chosen ahead of two Chief Constables for the £200,000-a-year post. John Apter, chairman of the federation’s Hampshire branch, said: ‘Tom Winsor has very little experience of policing and has attracted criticism from the rank and file over the way he has conducted his reviews into police reform. ‘The Home Secretary will have her own reasons for choosing Mr Winsor over other credible candidates – at this time I am struggling to understand what they might be.’ But ministers insisted Mr Winsor was the right man for the job and would be independent both of the police and the Government. Cuts fury: Officers jeer Theresa May as she backs Tom Winsor's policing reforms - which would include fitness tests and pay cuts for some officers - as she appears at the Police Federation annual conference last month . Police minister Nick Herbert told the . Today programme yesterday: ‘The direction of travel over the last few . years has been to ensure that the inspectorate is more  independent, not . just of the government ... but also of the police service itself.’ Federation chairman Paul McKeever was . left humiliated during the interview after he suggested senior . officers were set to resign over the appointment. But he then admitted he had spoken to . just ‘one middle ranking officer’. Mr McKeever said: ‘He is not just . there as a regulator, he is there to give, hopefully, sagacious advice . from a profound understanding of policing. ‘He is going to be in some very . high-powered meetings on occasions where the Prime Minister and Home . Secretary say, “Tom, what do you think?”. ‘And he is not going to know. He’s going to have to say, “Look,  I’m going to have to phone one of my advisers”. ‘That is not a position we should have somebody in who is going to be giving advice to government.’ Last month thousands of police marched to protest over changes to pay, conditions and pensions. Police shake-up: The appointment of Tom Winsor has sparked further anger among rank and file officers, just weeks after Home Secretary Theresa May was heckled at the Police Federation conference . Mr Winsor is unpopular among officers . after he proposed cutting bonuses and introducing compulsory fitness . tests in his wide-ranging review of policing. Among the more . controversial proposals in his two reports, Mr Winsor recommended that . police constables' starting salaries should be cut by up to £4,500 and . that the retirement age should be raised to 60. Controversial choice: Theresa May risks angering rank and file police officers by choosing lawyer Tom Winsor as her preferred choice as the next Chief Inspector of Constabulary . His . suggestion that chief constables should have the power to sack officers . were described by Federation leaders as ‘meddling with the very bedrock . of British policing’. Mr Winsor, a lawyer and former rail . regulator, was selected following an interview process conducted by the . Home Secretary, Theresa May. Thames Valley chief constable Sara . Thornton, and the top officer in the West Midlands, Chris Sims, who is . also a senior figure in the Association of Chief Police Officers, are . understood to have applied but lost out. Sir Denis O’Connor, the incumbent, is retiring this summer. Before his appointment is confirmed, Mr Winsor faces a grilling by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, which has vocally criticised how his reports were compiled. Bridget Phillipson, Labour MP for . Houghton and Sunderland South, said she was 'stunned' by the decision, . saying she could not even believe reports that Mr Winsor had applied. Matt Cavanagh, of the Institute for . Public Policy Research (IPPR) think-tank, saying he was a 'risky if not . reckless choice' which could damage the reputation of Her Majesty's . Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). 'As well as putting the relationship . between Government and the police under further strain, this provocative . choice could put at risk the growing reputation and contribution of . HMIC at a crucial time.' Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said Mrs May was 'probably' right in recommending Mr Winsor for the role, but added he still had hurdles to overcome before his appointment. 'If Theresa May has Tom Winsor as her . preferred candidate then she probably has very good reason to have him . in that way,' she said. 'The fact that he is not from a police background is innovative and it may be brilliant.' She . told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were 'still hurdles for Tom . Winsor to pass' because he must prove to the Home Affairs Select . Committee 'he has the understanding to do the job'. 'Theresa believes he can, I believe Theresa is probably, almost certainly, right.' A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Tom . Winsor has been named as the preferred candidate for the role of Her . Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary. ‘He will appear before the HASC before the appointment goes to the Prime Minister and the Queen for approval.’ Labour’s former home secretary David Blunkett said it was 'a very odd moment' for Mr Winsor to be named preferred candidate for the HMIC role when the police are dealing with cuts and many officers are up in arms about his reports. Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: 'It is almost like poking a stick through the bars of the lion’s den, at a moment when the police service are most on edge and most subject to disagreement and friction. Problems: The move has prompted anger and surprise among rank-and-file officers, with much criticism focusing on Mr Winsor's lack of policing experience . 'I think the Home Secretary has taken . a deliberate decision to say to the service ‘Not only are we not . backing off to your objections to Tom Winsor, we are not actually going . to be listening to your cry of pain in terms of what’s happening to the . service as a whole’.' He added: 'I have certainly no objection personally to Tom Winsor, nor in principle to bringing him in from outside.' But he said it was 'not the role' of the Chief Inspector to force . through Government reforms, but to offer ministers independent advice. 'The Home Secretary needs advice,' said Mr Blunkett. 'She has abolished the Police Improvement Agency, the . police authorities are being replaced by elected Police and Crime . Commissioners, the Association of Chief Police Officers is effectively . being dismantled. Where is that advice going to come from? 'It can’t come from someone who is not rooted in the service and is seen by the police service as antagonistic.'","Lawyer Tom Winsor set to get top job, sparking anger among rank and file officers .

Beth Lannetta and sister Kathryn, 14, took their dogs Star and her sister Molly for a walk from their home in Newport, Wales at around 8.30pm on Thursday. The pair split up to keep the dogs calm, and Beth, 8, had headed off to nearby rugby and football fields when she was approached by two girls. Shocking attack: Beth Lannetta, 8, who was slapped, kicked and given a bloody eye after sick thugs stole her beloved dog Star - pictured here with her other dog Molly . The girls then slapped and kicked her, telling the terrified youngster that her pet Cavalier King Charles spaniel was now theirs. Since the attack Beth's family have appealed for help to trace Star who was bundled on to a bus by the thieves. Her family claim Beth also escaped being snatched. The girls told the youngster they had a child ticket for her, but she refused to join them on the bus. Star is a white and tan - known as Blenheim - coloured Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

Upset: Beth's mother said she had been brave but was very upset about the attack and the loss of her beloved per dog . 'She knocked on the door but the girls ran off. Star was pulling back on her lead because she could see Beth, so she ran behind them and they got to the bus stop outside the Hanbury Arms. 'They then told her they had a child ticket so she could go with them. Luckily, Beth realised she would have to leave the dog and she ran home. 'By then it was gone nine, I'd panicked, and we were out looking for her. Then we got a phone call from home when she got back.'

Hannah Thomas-Jones was found alongside her mother, stepfather and younger brother, who were unconscious, when other family members tried to wake them on Sunday morning. It is thought they were poisoned after leaving a disposable barbecue in their tent overnight to keep them warm as temperatures plummeted to 2c (36f). Devastated: Hannah Thomas-Jones poses outdoors.

Hospital: The teenager's 11-year-old brother and parents are being treated at The Royal Shrewsbury . Dubbed the silent killer, carbon monoxide poisoning claims the lives of 25 people in Britain every year. Research suggests the number of deaths could be higher than official figures suggest, as medical staff do not always test for poisoning. As the gas is colourless and odourless, people with faulty appliances often fall unconscious without realising anything is wrong. Portable BBQs must always be used in an area with proper ventilation, preferably outside, due to the potential rapid build up of the deadly . gas. Low levels of exposure can cause dizziness, headaches and flu-like symptoms. It can quickly knock someone out by depriving them of oxygen and at high levels can kill in minutes. Wealthy . British businessman Philip Townsend, 55, and his wife MaryAnne, 52, are believed to have fallen victim to carbon monoxide while on holiday . in Estonia last month. The couple died in a converted barn which they are believed to have bought last year.

Last year, Tracy Screen, 35, died after being overcome by carbon monoxide while camping. It is thought the fumes drifted in from a barbecue outside her tent in Gyrn Goch, Caernarfon. When the Jones family did not emerge . from their tent on Sunday morning, a relative went in to find them all . unconscious inside and ran to a nearby pub to call for help. The disposable barbecue they used to cook the night before was in the porch of their tent, according to witnesses. There has been a spate of similar . tragedies recently, with campers overcome by fumes after using portable . barbecues. Carbon monoxide has no smell or taste but can kill quickly. Mrs Jones is an account manager for an internet company, while her husband is thought to be a teacher. Hannah lived with them and her brother in a terraced house in the Handforth area of Wilmslow, Cheshire. The children’s natural father, Richard Thomas, was not available for comment yesterday at his home in Macclesfield, Cheshire. The extended family who met for the holiday are thought to be consoling Mr and Mrs Jones at the hospital. Neighbours said Hannah’s family . enjoyed activity breaks.

'The family . are always going away on activity breaks. 'They love skiing and camping. They are always driving off with the car packed with all the gear.’ Phil and Debra Wright, who own the Baron at Bucknell pub and its adjacent campsite, said the family was part of a larger group made up of the mother’s two sisters and their respective partners and children, staying in a number of tents on the site. In a brief statement released through the hospital, the extended family said the incident had 'devastated' them and requested privacy to deal with the tragedy. The statement said: 'Our priority as a family is to ensure that the three people in hospital get well and are fully recovered. 'We are devastated by this tragic accident and will release a full statement at a later date. 'We would ask that you respect our privacy at this time.'

At the campsite yesterday, three police officers could be seen collecting bags and clothes from the family’s tent.

The Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations could keep the UK economy in recession for three quarters of the year, Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King has warned. Millions of people will take two days off work for a double Bank Holiday on June 4 and 5 as Queen Elizabeth II marks 60 years on the throne. The economy survived dropping into negative territory in the same period last year after an extra holiday for the Royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton hit output. Celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee could keep the UK in recession, warned Bank of England boss Mervyn King (right) But Sir Mervyn King warned yesterday that this year's celebrations will knock 0.5 of a percentage point off economic output between April and May. The decline could hinder efforts to haul Britain's fragile economy out of recession as the crisis in the Eurozone continues to dampen growth. While Sir Mervyn said the bigger picture was one of gradual recovery in growth, the impact of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee could  prolong the double-dip recession. Many workers are set to use the Monday and Tuesday bank holidays as the start of a whole week off, costing them just three days of annual leave. The remarks are a blow to David Cameron, who said in his New Year message that the Jubilee and the Olympics meant 2012 ‘must be the year we go for it’. A sign of parties to come: Confetti falls and flags fly from Harrods in London yesterday as the store celebrates the forthcoming Jubilee . In the same period last year, the economy fell short of expectations and grew by just 0.2 per cent. The Royal wedding hit output by 0.4 per cent but over the whole period the economy was able to recover. Sir Mervyn said growth 'zig zag' throughout 2012 with sporting events such as the Olympics providing a much-needed boost. A massive influx of overseas visitors will see them spending millions of pounds around the country. He said: 'Underlying quarterly output growth (in Q2) will be around something in the order of 0.5 percent stronger than the headline measure will show.    We will then see that in the Q3 data we will go back to normal and will see a bounceback in growth. A Bank Holiday to mark the Royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton last year hit economic output by 0.4 per cent . 'Trying to work out exactly how the Olympics will affect output growth is very difficult. Our best guess is that it is likely to boost growth somewhat. Our best guess, when you look at the headline numbers, underlying growth will be around half a percentage point stronger than the headline measure in Q2. 'In Q3 the combination of the bounceback from the Jubilee and the Olympics means that you could see growth exaggerated by slightly more than half a percentage point and then you'll get back to a weakening in Q4.' Sir Mervyn told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee earlier this year that the Jubilee celebrations would have a similar impact on the economy to last year’s Royal Wedding, when the recovery stalled. ‘We do expect a fall in output in the second quarter followed by a rise in the third quarter,’ he said. 'We lose an extra day’s work because of the additional bank holiday. We saw that last year and we would expect that to happen again this year.’ The Bank’s chief economist Spencer Dale said there was similar impact with last year’s Royal Wedding, when growth was reduced by around 0.4 percentage points. The second successive GDP quarterly has put the UK back in recession earlier this year . The GDP forecast for the next few years suggest the economy will see slow improvement, if any . He added: 'The Jubilee will have a slightly bigger effect, in part because it’s happening in June rather than April, so the ability for companies to make up that output within the quarter will be that much less.' The gloomy prediction came as Sir Mervyn yesterday warned the single-currency bloc was ‘tearing itself apart without any obvious solution’. Official figures released earlier this year showed that the UK had fallen into a double-dip recession. The economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of 2012 following a 0.3 per cent decline in the fourth quarter of 2011. A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction and it was the first since the credit crunch of 2009. Alan Clarke, UK and eurozone economist at Scotiabank, said: 'The economy hasn't grown for six months, and the headline second quarter GDP data are unlikely to stray much above zero, even if the underlying picture is more robust.' Ben Broadbent, a former Goldman Sachs economist who sits on the Bank’s interest rate setting committee with the Governor, said the extra day off would disrupt business. ‘It is 5 per cent of working time,’ he said. ‘Maybe a little less, but it is quite a lot.’","Output fell by 0.4 per cent after extra Bank Holiday for the Royal Wedding last year.. but economy still grew .
